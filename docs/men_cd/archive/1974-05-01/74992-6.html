        Heavy-line horse"" is hitched correctly. Dotted line shows same horse with hitch raised at ""A"" to accomodate short hitch. If dotted line horse were hitched same as heavy line horse, an up-pull on beam would result. Too long tugs have an opposite effect. Raising or lowering clevis at point ""A"" corrects line of draft from hame to point ""B""
