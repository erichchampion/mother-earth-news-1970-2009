    <p>
                        		<hr />    <p>      Here we are in our first Iowa winter, with plenty of time      to consider whether or not to plant our "field" of an acre      and a quarter in tomatoes. The nearby Heinz cannery      promises profits of up to $1,000 . . . <em>if</em> the crop      is good. In spite of an advanced education in horticulture,      however, I have a black thumb and, all my garden successes      are tempered with failures. True, back in Ohio it was, only      once in many years that the tomatoes flopped, but even once      is enough to make us cautious.    </p>    <p>      "Wait and see what the new soil and climate are like,"      suggests my family. "Find out what problems we have in the      garden before you commit us to a summer's work in the      fields . . . maybe all in vain." Reasonable enough.    </p>    <p>      FEBRUARY 13: The Caro Red seed arrived. This is our      favorite tomato: not quite red but darker than orange . . .      meaty, delicious and low in acid. Since many varieties can      be purchased as plants from the local greenhouse, we'll      concentrate our meager resources on Caro Red . . . which      can't be bought around here.    </p>    <p>      Back when we had a greenhouse, this was Tomato Planting      Day. The seedlings-grown cool, with no      setbacks-would be sturdy plants with tiny fruit by      May 15. But here in Iowa it's 20 below, with snowdrifts      over our heads, and all the growing space we have is a      sunny but frost-covered window. Now is the time to wait.    </p>    <p>      FEBRUARY 25: A neighbor called to ask if it was time to      plant tomatoes yet. "We ought to wait," I told her. (Then I      thought, "Maybe I shouldn't have said that if she was in      the mood. Seed planting and watching is cheap therapy      and-winter-weary as we are-we need it now.")      "Plant petunias instead," I suggested.    </p>    <p>      MARCH 27: Planted seeds today: put them in a clay pot of      soil with an inch of vermiculite (sterile medium to guard      against disease) on top and covered the whole thing with a      plastic bag to keep in moisture. Maybe I waited too long .      . . even March goes fast.    </p>    <p>      APRIL 1: No fooling, the seeds are sprouting! I took off      the plastic bag and moved the pot from the warm table to      the brightest spot on the windowsill. The later the      planting, the quicker the tomatoes come up.    </p>    <p>      APRIL 15: It rains every day. The seedlings look leggy.    </p>    <p>      APRIL 21: The tomatoes are all stem and pale green. The      roots haven't penetrated the soil enough yet. I fed them      with liquid plant food.    </p>    <p>      APRIL 24: The plant food helped. I should transplant the      seedlings to grow at least two inches apart, but where      could I put them? There's no sunny spot in Iowa. It's a      mistake to let them get stunted like this. If worst comes      to worst I'll have to buy whatever plants I can get.    </p>    <p>      MAY 5: Voila! Sunshine! I set the tomato plants out in the      cold frame for the day. Easy now. . . that's quite an      adjustment. I'll bring them in at night.    </p>    <p>      MAY 15: This is supposed to be Setting Out Day. It's still      not warm, though, and the wind is wicked. I think my plants      have given up . . . they're short and stunty and just not      growing at all.    </p>    <p>      The soil in the pots dries out in a few hours. To alleviate      this I've planted the seedlings right in the cold frame and      surrounded them with a plastic "fence" to protect them from      the winds. I think it's too late, though. I'll hope a few      more days, but the tomatoes look bad.    </p>    <p>      MAY 20: Another call for information from my neighbor. "Put      the plants outside in a very sheltered spot for just a      little while every day until they've hardened off," I told      her. "It's really too warm and dark in the house . . .      that's why your seedlings got so tall and spindly. And      right now it's too cool and windy outside, We need a happy      medium, a real covered cold frame to bridge the gap until      the tissues toughen." I'm so good with advice and theory .      . . and meanwhile my own plants just sit there and look at      me, refusing to die or to grow.    </p>    <p>      We're going on vacation in a week. I'll give them until we      get back, but I already know there won't be any early      tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      MAY 21: I bought a dozen plants and set them out to shiver      in the wind. I've put some in black plastic mulch (very      hard to work with, but supposed to be effective. I'll see.)    </p>    <p>      MAY 25: Something is eating my boughten tomatoes,      especially the ones in the plastic. Even though I never had      cutworms in Ohio, I should have taken precautions. Better      late than never? Anyhow, I put orange juice cans around the      bases of the plants, half in and half out of the ground.    </p>    <p>      MAY 28: It wasn't cutworms. It was rabbits. They eat      tomatoes out of a can, too. I give up. I'm going home to      mother.    </p>    <p>      JUNE 6: My home-grown plants are home but not growin'. I      planted the four biggest in the garden and bought a dozen      and a half more (the only ones left at the greenhouse were      very tall but fairly sturdy).    </p>    <p>      I have a friend who puts in tomatoes with a posthole digger      and has very good luck. Me, I'm too lazy to dig holes two      feet deep. Instead, I set the plants horizontally in      trenches about six inches deep . . . with the roots spread      out, most of the stem covered and only the top foot of      foliage bent up above ground. Roots will form all along the      stem now. I mulched the area well with old hay, because      that whole row is no place to be hoeing from now on.    </p>    <p>      Of the dozen bought plants I set out earlier, six survive.      The three in the plastic are starting to grow . . . the      others are just sitting there. My mother suggested blood      meal for the rabbits. Since they're vegetarians, the smell      is supposed to keep them away ... and the stuff is also an      excellent source of organic nitrogen. I took her advice and      dug some into the surface soil around the tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      JUNE 12: At last the plants are taking off (the ones in the      black plastic are definitely doing better). Either the      blood meal works or the rabbits are full . . . at any rate,      there's no more damage. The rest of the garden looks great.    </p>    <p>      In Ohio we used to get our tomato stakes at the dump, but      the local facility is an "off-limits" landfill. They raise      the crop in fields around here without any supports. It      should work . . . I think I'll just let the vines lie on      the mulch. Nevertheless, I'm pruning off the suckers from      the roots and pinching the side shoots back after the first      set of leaves.    </p>    <p>      JULY 4: The plants are going wild! I can't prune fast      enough. The ones in the plastic are growing more quickly,      becoming regular shrubs. They're blooming, but have no      little tomatoes yet. I wonder if they got too much      nitrogen? Time to pick peas and beans . . . the tomatoes      are on their own.    </p>    <p>      JULY 20: Only a few little tomatoes on the shrubs in the      plastic. Never saw such plants . . . all foliage and no      produce. There's definitely an overbalance of nitrogen in      this soil and the blood meal made it worse. It's too late      to correct the problem this year, but we'll apply rock      phosphate and granite dust in the fall and be more careful      in the future. Canning beans and beets like fury. Too busy      to worry about tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      AUGUST 1: Now we are starting to worry about the tomatoes.      Lots of blooms, even a batch of small green fruit, but      nothing to eat.    </p>    <p>      AUGUST 8: Fair time! We had our first try at showing      vegetables, and did very well. Hardly anyone has tomatoes:      Too many cool nights, they say. A few of ours have ripened,      but something else got there first. I'm bringing everything      pink or better to the kitchen windowsill. I don't mind      sharing, but the bugs can't have it all. Besides, water      sits on top of that plastic and causes rot in spots.    </p>    <p>      AUGUST 20: Sometimes in Ohio we didn't start canning until      now. Here we're just starting to have enough to eat. Sliced      tomatoes in every sandwich and more for supper . . . they      do taste good! This is the only way to live.    </p>    <p>      We have one plant of little yellow pear-shaped tomatoes at      the back door, and it's really loaded. The fruit is sweeter      than green grapes . . . we eat some every time we walk by.      I made a batch of preserves with them. Delicious, but what      a lot of peeling!    </p>    <p>      SEPTEMBER 8: Plenty to eat but not enough to can. Winter is      coming and I'm running scared. I bought a bushel of      tomatoes, added whatever we had extra and got 20 quarts of      juice.    </p>    <p>      My purchases were a canning variety with a thick,      tasteless, colorless skin . . . probably bred to resist      handling, and no doubt treated with chemical fertilizers      and pesticides. I was afraid to ask. Desperate as I am,      though, the difference between these and our home-grown      product was remarkable. I haven't bought tomatoes in years      and certainly don't recommend it.    </p>    <p>      SEPTEMBER 16: This is ridiculous! Frost could come any time      and I have nothing to lose. I made my way up the row and      pulled the vines firmly away from the piles of fine      tomatoes-most of them still green-that really      are hiding underneath. Now they can get some sun. I broke      off yards of greenery, everything above the last set      fruits. Any blossoms that are coming along now won't have      time to ripen and will only sap the strength of the plant      away from the ripening produce . . . so I was ruthless.    </p>    <p>      SEPTEMBER 27: Wow! Like bad children, those plants only      needed discipline. Every other day I pick tomatoes by the      five-gallon bucketful, spread the not-quite-ripes on the      hay pile and make kettles of juice. We like a drink      something like V-8, so I put in all the celery leaves and      stems, onions and carrots I feel like cleaning-plus a      bit of kale, basil, comfrey and chard-and then fill      the pot with tomatoes, red and yellow. I strain out the      juice with a food mill, add seasoning and a touch of sugar,      boil the brew and seal it in my weird assortment of jars      that aren't strong enough for the longer cooking of other      vegetables. This makes a thick, delicious juice which I use      in any recipe that calls for tomatoes, sauce, paste or      whatever. If you add a little soda to counteract the      acidity, it even makes a good cream soup. I know of one      family that cans the pulp left in the food mill for      vegetable soup, but we give ours to the pigs. They grow      fast in canning season.    </p>    <p>      SEPTEMBER 30: Sixty quarts of juice now . . . that should      do us. I've started canning the thinner top liquid to      drink, adding chili pepper and oregano to the thick part      and cooking it down for pizza sauce (12 pints so far). I      even gave away a bushel of tomatoes!    </p>    <p>      OCTOBER 3: Light frost has slowed the plants down, but not      stopped them.    </p>    <p>      OCTOBER 10: Light frosts every night now. I picked a box of      nice green tomatoes and spread them out in the cellar where      they'll keep ripening until almost Thanksgiving. Either      we've had our fill by now, however, or they don't taste      quite so good. I used as much unripe fruit as I could in      mincemeat and made green tomato pickles and relish. The      jars and shelves are almost full.    </p>    <p>      OCTOBER 25: Now that the snow is melted, I pulled out the      vine by the back door and dragged it to the compost pile.      From one root it strung out five feet in both directions.    </p>    <p>      I'm glad I didn't plant the field in tomatoes. It was best      to size up the climate and soil first: I've come to terms      with the former and praise the Lord for the latter. I'll      practice in the garden for one more season, I think, before      I try a cash crop. But it wasn't such a bad year for      tomatoes, after all.    </p>
