                		<p>      THE U.S. WILL HAVE A WORSE OIL SHORTAGE IN TWO YEARS than      the nation experienced last winter, even if imported      Arabian petroleum continues to flow freely into the      country. This prediction comes from Dr. Philip Abelson,      editor of Science , the official publication of the      130,000-member American Association for the Advancement of      Science. Abelson states that, in his opinion, President      Nixon's promise of U.S. energy self-sufficiency by 1980 is      "political eyewash". "We are not going to be able to meet      our needs for oil from domestic production," says Abelson.      "My guess is that, within two years, we're going to be in      trouble--probably worse trouble than at the height of the      embargo--because we'll have worked our way into even      greater dependence on foreign oil."    </p>    <p>      EXPECT UP TO A 100% PROBABILITY OF OIL SPILLS in the Gulf      of Alaska if offshore drilling is allowed in that region.      There can also be as much as a 40% increase in air      pollution in the San Francisco Bay Area (due to expanded      refinery activity) once Alaskan petroleum begins to arrive      in California. Please note, by the way, that these      projections were not dreamed up by some wild-eyed      ecologists . . . the warning comes directly from the      President's Council on Environmental Quality.    </p>    <p>      DESPITE RECENT HEADLINES ABOUT THE PLANET'S DEPENDENCY ON      OIL , approximately 80% of all households in developing      countries still rely on wood as a primary source of energy.      So says Keith Openshaw, a partner in the International      Forest Science Consultancy of Penicuik, Scotland. Openshaw      further states that demand for this fuel is growing faster      than supply and--unless a program of coordinated forestry      management is instituted in the poorer regions of the      world--developing nations could face an energy crisis that      dwarfs today's shortages. The planet's increasingly denuded      and treeless surface will also suffer greater damage from      floods and the spread of deserts.    </p>    <p>      ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGIES , INC . is the name and alternative      power systems is the game. The new company--recently      founded in Detroit, Michigan by Al and Dan O'Shea--has      already sold and installed several Dunlite windplants and      is now developing a 5.5 kw generator (designed to sell for      $2,800) of its own. The O'Shea brothers are also working on      a 50,000 Btu solar heating system that they intend to      manufacture. A1 and Dan seem to be Good Guys, appear to      know what they're doing and have assembled a hard-working      crew of people who can Get Things Done. If you're in the      market for a wind-driven generator or a solar heater for      your house, then, you could do worse than to contact      Environmental Energies, Inc., 11350 Schaefer, Detroit,      Michigan 48227.    </p>    <p>      METHANE-POWERED CAR IS DEMONSTRATED IN HAWAII . Although      MOTHER's experimenters have now operated two automobile      engines (a 1948 Chevrolet Six and a 1973 Honda) statically      on methane, we haven't yet actually run an automobile down      the road on the fuel. Nor, to our knowledge, had anyone      else in the U.S. Not, that is, until March 15, 1974 ...      when Dr. James H. Koshi, of the University of Hawaii, and      John van Geldern, of the Encotech Corporation, drove a      heavy sedan Around Varney Circle at the U. of H. The fuel:      methane produced from a combination of shredded palm      fronds, pig droppings and chicken manure. Encotech now      figures to set up ten waste digestion plants on Oahu and,      by the first of 1975, "should be making about 80,000      gallons of methane a week" . . . at least that's what a      clipping from the Honollulu Advertiser (sent in by Lyman      Crockenberg) says.    </p>    <p>      FOR THE LATEST NEWS ON THE METHANE-POWERED CAR THAT MOTHER      IS BUILDING RIGHT NOW , see the mini-article elsewhere in      this issue . . . complete with a photo yet!    </p>
