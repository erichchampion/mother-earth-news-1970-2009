                    <p>      <em>One of the world's most effective environmental groups      is San Francisco-based FRIENDS OF THE EARTH. Although FOE      publishes Not</em> <em>Man Apart -</em> <em>a monthly      tabloid magazine packed with authenticated, hard-to-find      facts that every concerned citizen needs - far too      few of MOTHER's readers regularly see a copy of NMA . We      are therefore quite pleased that FOE's staff has agreed to      write a regular FRIENDS OF THE EARTH column for THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(R)</em>    </p>    <h3>INDIAN REACTOR "CANDIDATE FOR DISASTER"</h3>    <p>      In 1972, Clifford Beck-head of the Government Liaison      Regulation Office of the Atomic Energy Commissionvisited      the U.S.-built Tarapur nuclear reactor on the west coast of      India. While there, he witnessed an incredible sight:      Indian workers, employed in the largest and "most      technologically advanced" atomic generating facility in      Asia, were using long bamboo poles to operate the plant's      radioactive waste system!    </p>    <p>      Concerned, Beck investigated further and found      "substantial" leaks in fuel shipments, haphazard storage of      radioactive materials, and high amounts of local      contamination. Although the plant was originally designed      for operation by only 250 workers at a time, he discovered      that-in the three years since the facility had been      completed in 1969-more than 1,300 employees had      received their maximum allowable doses of radiation, and      had been replaced. When he returned to AEC headquarters in      Maryland, the official told his colleagues, "Tarapur is a      prime candidate for disaster."    </p>    <p>      Several months later, three Indian health physicists      supported and elaborated on Beck's claims. Radioactivity,      they said, had been found along the Arabian Sea's shoreline      for up to 40 kilometers from the plant ... and in the      bodies of local people who ate fish. The scientists accused      General Electric and Bechtel Corporation (who together had      designed and built Tarapur) of engineering laxity.    </p>    <p>      The statements disturbed Bechtel. In 1973 (nearly a year      after Beck's initial report) the company sent John      Walkerone of its chief engineers-to investigate      Tarapur. Walker found that the problems did indeed exist      ... and that they would be neither temporary nor easily      solved. Worse yet, he discovered that a large number of key      American specialistswhose expertise was desperately needed      at the facility-had already received their maximum      doses of radiation, and had been sent home.    </p>    <p>      Still, the situation continued. In fact, it got worse. In      April of 1975, Indian energy officials admitted that the      total radiation released to personnel at Tarapur-and      the total quantity of radioactive waste      discharged-between June 1974 and March 1975 actually      <em>exceeded</em> that for all of 1973 (the year of      Walker's report)!    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, J.C. Shah-the chairman of India's      Atomic Power Authority-denied that the Tarapur      reactor had spread radioactivity along the seashore and      among the fish-eating population. "Being an atomic power      plant," he said, "there is bound to be some radioactive      fallout, but the authorities have kept it at a level lower      than tolerable and there is no concern at all."    </p>    <p>      The truth was simply not being told. Paul      Jacobs-editor of the new magazine <em>Mother</em>      Jones-heard the story and went to India to gather      information and write an article on the subject for his      first issue. And in the process, he uncovered a secret      Indian government report-issued in 1973-which documented at      least two cases of radiation-induced cancer deaths ... and      which assumed that other Tarapur workers would be victims      too! (Unfortunately, the fates of those "other workers"      will probably never be confirmed. Most of the local      villagers who worked at Tarapur and left because of high      radiation exposure were transient ... and once they moved      on, became virtually impossible to locate.)    </p>    <p>      Jacobs printed his blockbuster article on Tarapur in the      premier (February/March 1976) edition of <em>Mother Jones      ...</em> and the ensuing furor has yet to subside. Why?    </p>    <p>      Because it so happens that Tarapur is almost identical      to-and was designed and constructed by the same companies      as-the Dresden I reactor in northern Illinois. What's more,      many of the nuclear power plants exported to foreign      countries by U.S. firms today are also near-duplicates of      their original American counterparts ... and the incidents      at Tarapur point out the need for (and total lack of)      mutual communication between countries and companies who      use or manufacture nuclear generating equipment.    </p>    <p>      "If a design flaw develops in a carbon-copy reactor," wrote      Jacobs, "the chances are that the same will turn out to be      true of the original. The problem is that there is no way      we can quickly tell when something goes wrong with one of      those overseas reactors ... and the companies involved      aren't eager to tell anyone when they find out."    </p>    <h3>MORE FUEL TO THE FIRE AT TARAPUR</h3>    <p>      The latest development in the Tarapur controversy has      emerged from the offices of the United States Nuclear      Regulatory Commission.    </p>    <p>      Early this year, environmentalists learned that the NBC was      preparing to grant export licenses for two separate      shipments of low-enriched uranium intended for Tarapur.      Several activist groups and fifty members of Congress asked      the agency to hold hearings first, and pointed out that      U.S. support of India's nuclear program was inconsistent      with national security and the public safety goals of the      Atomic Energy Act.    </p>    <p>      India-in addition to already having enough plutonium      to make hundreds of nuclear weapons, and in addition to      running its two reprocessing plants under almost no      safeguards- has long been a vigorous opponent of the      Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. Canada, in fact, now      refuses to participate at all in that eastern nation's      atomic industry, because the "peaceful" nuclear technology      they contributed to the country was used to build an atom      bomb.    </p>    <p>      The NRC, however, "compromised" by letting the first      45,000-pound shipment go to India immediately, and promised      that hearings would be held later.    </p>    <h3>JUDGE NIXES FISHING "ON PORPOISE"</h3>    <p>      This summer, Federal Judge Charles Richey ordered the tuna      industry to stop fishing "on porpoise".    </p>    <p>      For years, fishermen have taken advantage of the fact that      yellowfin tuna-one of the most "marketable" of all      varieties-can be found under and behind schools of      surface-swimming porpoises. Commercial skippers would      simply throw out purseseine nets wherever they sighted the      cetaceans, and pull the drawstrings shut. Theoretically,      the dolphins could swim outleaving only the tuna      behind-but in too many cases the airbreathing mammals      were trapped, and drowned. Nobody knows exactly how many      porpoises have been killed over the years in this manner,      but the number is undoubtedly in the millions.    </p>    <p>      Now, however, the use of the purse-seine net has been      effectively banned. The Marine Mammal Protection Act,      passed in 1972, stated that porpoise kills incidental to      tuna fishing were to decrease steadily from that year on,      and eventually reach zero. But the decline never happened.      And when the Environmental Defense Fund and eleven other      groups sued the Department of Commerce for enforcement of      the law, tuna fishermen cried that their business would be      wiped out if they couldn't continue fishing "on porpoise".    </p>    <p>      Judge Richey apparently saw the situation differently. "The      interests of the marine mammals come first under the      statutory scheme," he said in his decision, "and the      interest of the industry, important as they are, must be      served only after protection of the animals is assured."    </p>    <p>      Predictably, tuna companies are appealing the decision ...      and are also lobbying hard to get a law passed that will      exempt them from such rulings in the future.      Conservationists, of course, are opposing such measures.    </p>    <h3>GOOD NEWS FROM THE DELTA</h3>    <p>      Dow Chemical Company's plans (reported in MOTHER NO, 40) to      construct a $600 million petrochemical plant in the      Sacramento River Delta have been blocked. The Bay Area Air      Pollution Control District refused-on a preliminary      basis, at leastto grant an operating permit for the      proposed facility. And the agency also axed Arco's scheme      to build an even bigger plant adjacent to Dow's.    </p>    <p>      The problem? Pollution ... and lots of it, already choking      the air in the Bay Area with oxidants, particulates, and      hydrocarbons. The factories would've poured even more of      the noxious stuff into the atmosphere, and-by the      very stuff into me atmosphere and-by the very nature      of their chemical products-would've presented a      serious threat of water contamination as well.    </p>    <p>      Now, however, it looks as though the Delta-including      Suisan Marsh, the largest tidal wetlands area remaining in      the state-has a fighting chance. In a recent      interview with a San <em>Francisco Chronicle</em> reporter,      one senior air district official commented, "I'm not sure      anything can be built there under our rules."    </p>    <h3>PROPOSITION 15 DEFEATED</h3>    <p>      On June 8, California's voters turned out in surprising      numbers to beat Proposition 15-the nuclear safety      initiative-by a tidy margin of two to one.    </p>    <p>      As you know if you read this column in MOTHER NOS. 33 and      37, the measure would've required utility companies to      prove to the state legislature-once and for all-that      atomic power is safe power. Antinuclear activists didn't      really expect to win on election day, but-on the      other hand-we didn't anticipate losing as badly as we      did, either.    </p>    <p>      The spending capacity of our opponents was undoubtedly a      major factor in the defeat. Although supporters of the      initiative organized the best citizen-backed campaign in      California's history-and managed to raise over a      million dollars-contributions on the other side from      pro-nuclear utility companies, reactor manufacturers, and      other large corporations added up to several times that      amount. (In fact, the legality of donations from some      out-of-state companies is questionable ... and several      state Attorney Generals are now investigating those firms.)    </p>    <p>      The "NO-on-15" forces launched a formidable      radio-and-television campaign, and apparently managed to      convince Californians that the initiative would completely      shut down nuclear power, throw the state into economic      chaos, place an extra utility-bill burden on every family,      increase air pollution and lung cancer (from coal- and      oil-burning plants), and cause a rise in unemployment.    </p>    <p>      Supporters of Proposition 15, on the other hand, argued      that the measure would amount to a shutdown only if      reasonable safety requirements couldn't be met, and      stressed the desirability of legislative over "expert"      judgment on the subject, the issue of people versus large      corporations, and the dangers that nuclear energy presents      to future generations.    </p>    <p>      It's clear who stroked the voters' heartstrings best. A      backpatting post-mortem memo, purloined from within the      Pacific Gas and Electric Company, reveals the "other      side's" strategy: "We campaigned against the initiative      measure itself; we did not allow ourselves to be      sidetracked into a debate over nuclear safety (which is an      argument we would not have won), or the appropriateness of      our spending or any other non-relevant issues."    </p>    <p>      The debate still goes on in other states, however. Arizona,      Colorado, Oregon, and Washington all have similar nuclear      initiatives on their November ballots. And meanwhile,      Californians for Nuclear Safeguards-the prime force      behind the pro-Proposition 15 campaign-will keep its      offices open indefinitely and continue to fight for safe      energy.    </p>
