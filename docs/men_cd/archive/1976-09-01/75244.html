                    <h2 id="subtitle">     A SMALL WORD ABOUT INFLATION</h2>   <p>      There's a lot of political and economic talk making the      rounds these days about how we've "whipped" inflation.      Don't you believe it. According to International Reports,      Inc., 200 Park Ave., New York, N.Y. 10003, the current      annual rate of inflation in the United States is running at      6.2%.    </p>    <p>      This means that if you hide a dollar in the cookie jar      today ... and then dig it out <em>just five years from      now</em> ... that dollar will buy less than three-quarters      (only 72.4%) of what it can purchase right now. Or, to turn      it around the other way, you'll have to invest that dollar      in something which- <em>after all taxes</em> <em>and      handling fees</em> - <em>will</em> guarantee you 6.2%      interest (compounded annually) just to keep its purchasing      power from shrinking.    </p>    <p>      Inflation, in short, is a <em>long</em> way from being      "whipped", and it is a mark of extreme economic naivete (on      both his part and on ours) when a major U.S. presidential      candidate-Jimmy Carter-can say without      challenge that he intends to concentrate on jobs and "let      inflation take care of itself". Gerald Ford may bump his      head a lot (and we'd certainly never endorse him, or anyone      else, for President), but he at least has sense enough to      leave his administration's economic policy in the hands of      men (Burns, Simon, Greenspan) who understand that inflation      is, indeed, Economic Public Enemy Number One to any stable      society.    </p>    <p>      So what are we gonna do? If the guys already in office know      <em>how</em> to hold the line but can't ... and the guys      trying to get in office don't even <em>know</em> how to      hold the line ... what are we gonna do?    </p>    <p>      <strong>STOP EXPECTING POLITICIANS TO COME UP WITH MAGIC      ANSWERS.</strong> That's one thing we can do. After all,      you wouldn't set a fox to guard your chickens, would you?      Then why let the guys who got us into all this economic      trouble have chance after chance after chance at getting us      out (especially when they just keep on making everything      worse)?    </p>    <p>      Quit playing by "their" rules. Cut your dependence on what      "they" think is a fair rate of inflation ... a fair return      on your investment ... a fair rate of payment (minimum      wage) for your work ... a fair rate of taxation.    </p>    <p>      No, you won't be able to sever all your economic ties to      The System overnight ... or, probably, ever. But you can      certainly take a lot more of your life into your own hands      during the next few months (no matter what your current      economic status might be) than most folks ever do these      days.    </p>    <p>      Buy a farm. And if you can't do that, build a greenhouse      onto your home. And if you live in an apartment, install a      "grow box" in a window. Learn to sprout seeds and use them      in tasty recipes. Put a henhouse in the backyard. Nail      together some rabbit pens in the garage. One way or      another, make yourself more food self-sufficient.    </p>    <p>      Put up a windplant. Install a solar heater. Learn to use a      fireless cooker. Insulate your house better. Drive less.      Use a car pool. Take a bath with a friend. One way or      another, make yourself more energy self-sufficient.    </p>    <p>      And, the more food and energy self-sufficient you become,      the less inflation will touch you. You can put that in the      bank no matter who wins the coming election.    </p>
