               <p>      <em>Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Four years ago, when      there were NO currently relevant small-scale-farming      introductory handbooks available, many of us welcomed the      publication of Richard Langer's Grow It! with open arms.      Now that we're all older and more experienced, however,      some folks find it increasingly easy to criticize that      breakthrough beginner's guide (see the</em> <em>Feedback      sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24, and 25).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is      just as important (probably more so) now as Grow It! was      four years ago ... and which may well come up for its share      of criticism in another 48 months or so.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Be that as it may, John and Sally Seymour's record of      18 successful years on a shirttail-sized homestead in      England is important now and should offer welcome      encouragement to today's back -to-the-landers . . . both      real and imaginary. I started serializing the book in my      No. 25 issue and I'm sure that many readers will want a      personal copy for their home libraries.-MOTHER.</em>    </p>            <p>      Copyright Â© 1973 by John and Sally Seymour.      Introduction copyright C, 1973 by Schocken Books Inc.    </p>    <p>      <em>Every farmer will understand me when I say, that he      ought to pay for nothing in money, which he can pay for in      anything but money.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">     by WILLIAM COBBETT    </h5>    <p>      <strong>BEES</strong>    </p>    <p>      The pre-industrial Revolution manner of keeping bees would      not commend itself to the officers of the R.S.P.C.A.,      because the bees were 'put down', as the latter would term      it, every autumn. The hive with precision-cut moveable      frames had not been invented, and the only way in which the      honey could be extracted was to burn a little sulphur      underneath the hive and liquidate the bees. The picturesque      straw skeps were treated in this manner, and in Africa and      most parts of Asia today this is still the manner of      keeping, and ceasing to keep, bees. In Central Africa one      frequently sees hollowed <em>-</em> out logs hung in the      trees: these are the equivalents of the medieval bee skeps      in England. There are bee keepers in dear old England today      who, whisper it not, do this very thing. They put old      orange boxes or other crates and receptacles around the      backs of their houses, where the neighbours can't see them,      and put a few old bee frames with a bit of wax on them and      the smell of bees inside them, and either hope that some      bees will arrive from somewhere (and if bees have been kept      in that garden for a long time you can be fairly sure some      will) or else go out and capture a swarm and put them in      the box. The busy little insects fill the box completely      with honeycomb and honey, but all jammed in there      higgledy-piggledy, and there is absolutely no way known to      man of extracting that honey without killing those bees.      But there, the economics of the thing, from Man's point of      view, are perfectly sound. The bees, by the autumn, have      done their work. They have made their honey. If the man is      going to keep them alive all winter it either means that he      has got to leave a large part of their honey with them for      them to live on, or else feed them with sugar. In a country      with a high proportion of woodland and forest, and      therefore of wild bees, there will always be plenty of      fresh swarms in the spring, and a swarm of bees in May is      worth a load of hay, and worth none the less because you      didn't have to feed it and look after it all winter.    </p>    <p>      It was the discovery of the <em>bee space</em> that made      this yearly butchery unnecessary though. The bee space is      the exact space in which a bee will build its comb and yet      leave a space for itself to crawl about in. Thus the frames      of a modern beehive are exactly the right distance from      each other so that the bees will build the combs out from      them to the correct size of combs but yet leave a bee space      between the combs. If the frames were a small fraction of      an inch further apart the bees would start building 'wild      comb' between the frames and thus fill the whole space in;      if they were a fraction nearer the bees would not be able      to build out from both frames, because there would not be      room for them to work. Therefore, with this discovery of      the bee space, it was possible to construct beehives with      such precision that the bees build their combs as we want      them to, on frames that we put there for them, frames that      can be removed to extract the honey without disturbing the      bees too much, and be put back again for the bees to start      filling with honey again. The stock of bees can be kept      from year to year, which is more humane, and also enables      the bee keeper to start early in the season with strong      stocks of bees in all of his hives. He doesn't have to wait      for the Lord to send him 'a swarm of bees in May' because      he's already got several good swarms of bees tucked up in      his hives in January.    </p>    <p>      The feeding of a little sugar to the bees to keep them      alive in the winter and to enable the beekeeper to rob them      more thoroughly in the autumn has developed, among many      modern beekeepers, into feeding them on sugar all the time      exclusively. Bees will not bother to go and look for nectar      if there is plenty of sugar available, and many beekeepers      buy stores of cheap sugar generally condemned for human      consumption, and feed it direct into their hives, and the      bees just turn it directly into honey. Which is why so much      honey today tastes something like honey, and yet not      <em>quite</em> like honey. The honey that comes in from      underdeveloped parts of the world like Mexico, however,      generally really tastes like honey, because the beekeepers      in such lands cannot afford to buy the sugar to feed the      bees: it is when labour is dear and industrial sugar is      cheap relative to labour that beekeepers shove in the      sugar.    </p>    <p>      But the keeping of a few colonies of bees is an obvious      ploy for the self-supporter. The initial outlay necessary      on modern hives and equipment is fairly high (you have to      have an extractor, for example) but once you have the      equipment there is a very valuable harvest to be taken      every year for the rest of your life. You don't need to buy      any sugar, condemned or otherwise, to feed the bees on. We      have not so much kept bees as had bees around for the last      sixteen years, and most years we have got some honey from      them, and we have never fed them on any sugar. We merely      abstain from robbing them too severely in the autumn.    </p>    <p>      Of all the arts and crafts of the countryside, beekeeping      is the one that least lends itself to being taught by a      book. Also to give any idea of the subject would take a      book at least as long as this one. Therefore, I must merely      recommend the novice to join his local bee group, if he has      one (and he probably has), or at least put himself under      the tuition of some good master. Also, buy a book on the      subject. There are many. We have two hives, but not enough      'supers' for them (that is stories to add to their height      and make more room for honey), but this year we took nearly      a hundred-weight of honey without going to much trouble and      leaving plenty of honey to keep the bees through the winter      time. A day a year is really all you have to devote to your      bees. All I would advise is, do not make the mistake that      we have made and get hold of components from two different      sorts of beehive, also get a really bee-proof rig to wear      when you are working with your bees. Nothing is more likely      to diminish your love for these little insects than having      a few score of them buzzing about inside a leaky veil      trying to get out, while a few hundred of their sisters      outside dive-bomb angrily at you outside trying to get in.      And remember bees, when they alight on you, crawl upwards.      They won't crawl down into Wellington boots but by God they      will climb up your jumper if it isn't well tucked into your      trousers. And the presence of a dozen or two crawling about      your midriff, and occasionally stinging you, will not      increase the calmness and efficiency with which you are      likely to carry out your operations. If you are completely      bee-proof you can be very cool and efficient, and cool and      efficient you have got to be.    </p>    <p>      If you had enough bees, and looked after them well enough,      you would not need to buy any sugar at all. Two hives,      managed in a professional manner, would be enough. I for      years in what was then called Barotseland, in what was then      called Northern Rhodesia, in what I believe is still called      Africa, without ever tasting sugar. There was plenty of      wild honey. Once you have got used to it honey is fine in      tea or coffee, and on porridge if you must eat the stuff.      In fact there is no good purpose for which honey is not      better than sugar. It is not in any way bad for your teeth,      as sugar is, nor it lead to all the other evils now being      put down to refined sugar. It is a lot dearer than sugar      <em>-</em> if you have to buy it, but if you don't      have to buy it as we don't, it is, quite simply, free.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WILD FOOD</strong> It goes without saying that the      kind of wild food that you will get will depend entirely      upon where you live. As an example, when we lived in      Suffolk, pheasants, hares and wild duck made up a very      large proportion of our meat intake (particularly pheasants      and hares); we ate, of fungi, parasol mushrooms, ceps,      shaggy ink caps, saffron milk caps, puff balls, field      mushroom; there were plenty of blackberries, some nuts,      plenty of elderberries, sloes, plenty of wild plums every      three years, mussels down on the estuary. In Pembrokeshire      we find no pheasants, no hares, very few fungi except a few      field mushrooms, tons of the finest blackberries, most      years plenty of hazel nuts, elderberries and sloes, and      cranberries on the mountains if we have time to pick them,      which generally we have not. Small sea mussels, cockles and      razor fish are there for the getting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PHEASANTS.</strong> The self-supporter, unless he      is just doing it for a game like Marie Antoinette playing      shepherdess, will scarcely wish to indulge himself in      shooting driven pheasants with twelve-bore cartridges at      tenpence a shot. But there are cheaper and more effective      methods of taking pheasants, and, if you have a game      licence, you are quite within the law shooting pheasants on      your own land unless the right has been reserved by a      previous owner when he sold the land. You can't own a rifle      without a police permit, but if you have this then a .22 is      a very effective weapon for killing pheasants, and 'short      rifle' ammunition is very cheap.    </p>    <p>      In the first place, if a man occupies even a small piece of      land, and his neighbours have pheasants, he can also have      pheasants. There are certain crops which pheasants just      cannot resist. One is the Jerusalem artichoke. A row or two      of it won't make much difference, but a stand of, say, a      quarter of an acre will bring pheasants from far and wide.      They like the cover it affords them and they like the      artichokes themselves as food.    </p>    <p>      Buckwheat is a marvellous crop for attracting pheasants.      Kale is not bad but only so-so. Maize is good. Sunflower is      absolutely splendid <em>-</em> as good as Jerusalem      artichoke, which it so closely resembles. But I would say      the latter plant plus buckwheat are the ones to plant.    </p>    <p>      Dogs will catch pheasants. Many a gypsy man has a lurcher      dog (a cross-bred with greyhound or whippet in his      ancestry) which will take a pheasant on the ground. It is      unforgivable of course to take a hen off the nest, and no      decent poacher would do it. If it did happen by accident he      would collect the eggs and put them under a chicken hen to      bring them off.    </p>    <p>      But if you do get any pheasants, or partridges, hang them      up, guts and all, by their necks (not their legs like      chickens) in the larder, and leave them there for at least      a week in the winter before you cook them. You hang them by      their necks to keep the blood in the body, and also to keep      the guts from tainting the breast meat.    </p>        <p>      <strong>PIGEONS AND OTHER BIRDS.</strong> Pigeon would be      fine if they didn't cost so much to shoot. I used to shoot      wild geese but don't any more since I discovered that they      mate for life. We all may get fed up with our husbands and      wives from time to time but we don't want them shot. Wild      ducks don't though, and are noble food, so are most of the      waders. Curlew, lapwing, golden plover, red shank were once      considered grand eating, but they are protected birds in      Great Britain. They all want hanging for a few days, at      least.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RABBITS,</strong> if they ever come back, can be      picked off with the .22 in the early morning or the      evening, driven into a purse-net from their holes by      ferrets, driven into a long-net at night by a dog or two.      The long-net is set, very quietly, between the feeding      grounds of the rabbits and their holes. It is set on      sharpened pickets sloped into the ground, but very baggy.      Then one operator takes the dog and walks round the feeding      grounds and drives the rabbits into the net, while the      other crouches down at one end of the net and runs along it      to take the rabbits out and 'show them London' by breaking      their necks in the manner I have described for killing      chickens. I used to go long-netting with a deaf man, and as      we had to be very silent (it was gamekeeper country)      communication between us could be hazardous. A countryman      will 'hulk' a rabbit (paunch it) and 'hock' it (cut behind      the gam string of one leg and shove the other leg through      so that it can be hung on a stick or on the handlebars of      his bicycle) without using a knife. He uses the sharp claw      of the rabbit's own foot. Gut or 'hulk' rabbits as soon as      you catch them, but not hares.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HARES</strong> can be caught with a good lurcher.      We had a very small lurcher named Esau who would run down a      hare very often if he had the chance, and I remember taking      him for a walk over the marshes when we already had too      many hares in the larder and coming back with three more      hares. A lurcher can be trained to keep out of sight, and      never to come near his master if a stranger is in sight.      Don't hulk hares immediately. They are game, while rabbits      are not. Hamstring a hare, hang her up in a cool larder by      her hind legs for a week (or a fortnight if you like game      hung well) then skin her carefully before you gut her, then      hulk her (a stinking and disgusting job <em>-</em>      but don't be put off by the whiff, it doesn't matter);      always save the blood to put in the sauce. Hares are      absolutely delicious and there are many ways of cooking      them besides jugging them. A hare a week through-out the      winter is not too many.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FUNGI.</strong> Most fungi are edible and some,      notably parasol, shaggy ink cap, and cep, are absolutely      delicious. But I positively refuse to start describing      which fungi are edible and which are not, for without very      good photographs this course might lead to disaster. You      must either get somebody to show you, or get a very good      book. It is absurd though that only the field mushroom      generally gets eaten, when there are so many other      excellent ones. We have a good book, and try any fungus      that we can identify as edible at least once. Some are      edible but pretty tasteless.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MUSSELS.</strong> Mussels are fine if they come      from genuinely unpolluted water but can be very dangerous      if they do not. In any case do not take the advice of most      cookery books and only steam them long enough for them to      open their shells. This is very dangerous. They should be      boiled, or thoroughly steamed, for at least twenty minutes.      And make absolutely sure that you use none that were not      tight-closed before you cooked them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COCKLES</strong> can be raked out of sand-beds at      low tide with a steel garden rake. Professionally they are      raked into a little hand net and swished about in shallow      water over the sand to get the sand out. I have seen four      men rake out a ton of them on one low tide. In such cases      the fish are generally loaded straight into the holds of      smacks which have been stranded on the sands at high water,      but in Kent there are men who load them on to old bicycle      frames, and in Wales women who load them on donkeys. Boil      them for twenty minutes in sea water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RAZOR SHELLS,</strong> or razor fish, are delicious      to eat: a kind of clam. You may see their blow-holes in      sand right down at the water's edge at very low spring      tides. If you walk backwards over the sand you will see      them spurt water after you have passed. Either dump a      handful of salt on the hole, 'in which case they will come      out and you can get a spade under them, or use a      'razor-fish-spear'. This is a slender steel spear with      small barbs on it. You push it down the hole, the razor      fish closes on it, and you pull him out.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LIMPETS</strong> can be eaten, and I have eaten      them raw. To get them off the rocks kick them quickly      before they know you are there, or they will cling down      hard and you won't get them off. They are better cooked.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SALT</strong> . If you don't like buying salt      <em>-</em> take a large vessel down to the beach one      fine summer's day, send your children looking for plenty of      driftwood, light a fire under the vessel and keep pouring      buckets of sea water into it. Make sure you draw your sea      water from where it is fairly deep and has no sand in      suspension. If you keep doing this all day you will have      enough of the very best sea salt to last you for table use      throughout the year, although not <em>-</em> of      course <em>-</em> enough for curing fish or ham.    </p>
