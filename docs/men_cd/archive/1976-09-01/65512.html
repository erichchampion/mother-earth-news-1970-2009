                    <h5 id="byline">     by ALAN McNEILL:    </h5>       <p>      Although homemade wine can be really terrible, it can also      be really great. In fact (if you know how to go about it),      you can actually make wine at home that will be better than      any jug wine you're apt to buy. Not <em>as good</em> .      <em>Better. And</em> you'll have the additional      satisfaction of knowing that your do-it-yourself drink is      all natural and alive ... not laced with some commercial      winery's sorbates, sulfur dioxide, or glycerol. And not      filtered through asbestos.    </p>    <p>      Thanks to the high pressures of today's marketplace, you      see, commercial wineries (if they want to stay in business)      are <em>forced</em> to pound their products into shape with      filters and chemicals and pasteurization. They simply can't      afford to make everyday wines (which sell for less than      $3.00 a bottle) in any other way. The longer they hold a      bottle or a jug or a vat of their product, the more it      costs them. To a businessman, time is money. .. and the      more of it he can squeeze out of the line he markets      <em>-</em> be it widgets or wine <em>-</em> the      more competitive he becomes.    </p>    <p>      Ahhh, and there's the rub. Time. Really good wine can only      develop over time. And, unlike the owner of a commercial      winery, time is the one ingredient you have plenty of. This      is the edge that you, as a home winemaker, have. This is      the advantage which <em>-</em> used wisely      <em>-</em> will allow you to make better wine than      you can buy.    </p>        <h3>AND IT'S EASY!</h3>    <p>      If you can fall out of bed in the morning, you can make      good wine. It's that easy. But you'll never do it if you      try to just blunder along, follow a recipe, throw in a      little baker's yeast from time to time, and see what      happens.    </p>    <p>      To make really good <em>-</em> even superb!      <em>-</em> wine, you must understand the fundamentals      of each step of the process. And you must learn to be      absolutely religious about keeping everything in your      mini-winery spotlessly clean at all times. Master these two      basics of the art, and you'll be able to produce      exceptional wine from almost any fruit and a variety of      vegetables. (Don't laugh. The English even make the drink      from hedge leaves . . . and one of the best wines I've ever      tasted was made from beets.)    </p>    <h3>THE MYSTERIES OF FERMENTATION</h3>    <p>      The (to most people) seemingly mysterious world of      fermentation is actually as straightforward and easy to      comprehend as any other chemistry experiment. A solution      <em>-</em> called must <em>-</em> of water,      sugar, fruit juice, and fruit pulp is prepared in a      scrupulously clean container and wine yeast is then      introduced to the must.    </p>    <p>      That's wine yeast, and not baker's yeast. Baker's yeast is      bred for the taste it leaves in baked goods, while wine      yeast has been carefully developed over hundreds of years      to leave no taste in wine at all. Baker's yeast is "top      fermenting" (most of its action, when it's used to make      wine, takes place in the upper few inches of the must) ...      wine yeast "bottom ferments". Baker's yeast is sometimes      killed by the first few percentage points of alcohol that      develop in a container of must ... wine yeast can withstand      as much as a 16% concentration of alcohol.    </p>    <p>      When the yeast plants (actually, very minute fungi) are      added to the must, they rapidly reproduce themselves and      release carbon dioxide. And, once this carbon dioxide has      flushed all the oxygen from the must, the yeast settles      down to consume the sugar in the solution and produce      alcohol in earnest. Then, when all the sugar is gone (when      the must has been converted to wine), the yeast      automatically dies and drifts slowly to the bottom of the      container.    </p>    <p>      And basically (although we'll delve into finer points of      the art as we proceed through this article) that's it. Our      job as winemakers is not to make wine ... but to allow the      yeast to make wine. Our task, to put it another way, is      simply to set up and control the conditions <em>under which      the process takes place so</em> that the best strain of      yeast we can obtain is protected and nurtured and left free      to make the finest wine it's capable of producing.    </p>        <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>    <p>      Here's all the important items of hardware you'll need to      set yourself up as a vintner:    </p>    <p>      [1] An open container of at least eight gallons      capacity<br />      [2] A two-gallon stainless steel or enameled bowl or      pot<br />      [3] A two-quart, small-mesh sack<br />      [4] Nine one-gallon, small-mouth jugs<br />      [5] One one-half gallon, small-mouth jug<br />      [6] Six feet of flexible, clear plastic tubing<br />      [7] Twenty-five screw top wine bottles with plastic      caps<br />      [8] A roll of plastic food wrap<br />      [9] An assortment of rubber bands<br />      [10] A DEPENDABLE hydrometer<br />    </p>    <p>      The first item on the list will be used as a primary      fermentation vat. Some people prefer that this container be      made of the traditional wood or crockery. But, since both      wood and crockery are porous and almost impossible to      completely clean and disinfect, many other home winemakers      (including me) feel that a better bet is a primary      fermenter made of food-grade plastic. Try a brand-new      plastic (remember, of food grade) wastepaper can or garbage      pail ... they're ideal.    </p>    <p>      Beware of most metals (anything except stainless steel)      when you're selecting the primary fermenter and other      utensils for your home winery. Metal almost always leaves a      haze and an off-taste in wine. Stick with wood, glass, and      plastic. And make sure your main fermenting vat will hold      at least eight gallons. Primary fermentation is often quite      vigorous and can overflow a smaller container.    </p>    <p>      The small-mesh sack specified above will be filled with      fruit pulp and left in the main vat during primary      fermentation. Make sure it's large enough to hold two full      quarts and still tie off securely at the top. The bag can      be made of any porous material: You might, for instance,      want to sew up several sacks from a section of nylon      drapery. Personally, I just use the legs off an old pair of      panty hose.    </p>    <p>      Cider jugs make very fine gallon and half-gallon bottles      for secondary fermentation. I get mine from a local glass      recycling center for 10 cents apiece, but you might prefer      to collect yours from restaurants and friends. Colored      glass and plastic jugs are OK ... but I prefer clear glass      so I can look right into the containers and watch my wine      develop its polish.    </p>    <p>      You'll use the plastic tubing to siphon your wine from one      container to another at various times during its      production. This piece of equipment is more important than      it may at first seem because, except for the first time the      wine is moved, it should <em>never</em> purposely be      exposed to the air. Oxygen can react with a green      (undeveloped) wine to produce a nutty flavor (which,      although desirable in a sherry, is considered a flaw in a      normal table wine). Worse yet, if oxygen is allowed into a      new bottle of wine, it can foster the growth of something      you don't want at all: vinegar bacteria.    </p>    <p>      If you can't get transparent plastic hose, colored hose      (either plastic or rubber) will do. I prefer clear plastic      tubing, however, because I can always tell whether or not      it's clean inside. And, yes, used hose is all right as long      as it's clean and hasn't been used to siphon something      that's caustic or which could impart an off-taste to your      wine.    </p>    <p>      You'll probably have less trouble rounding up the      twenty-five wine bottles listed above than anything else on      your equipment list. Most states mandatorily require all      restaurants, bars, and caterers to throw out all their wine      and liquor bottles as soon as the containers are empty. As      a result, such establishments are usually happy to have you      haul the empties away. And if you prefer the heavier      champagne bottles, just check out the next few weddings and      parties in your section of town.    </p>    <p>      I like to store my wine in bottles that close with screw      caps. You can buy new ones for about a nickel apiece (or      scrounge good used caps at a recycling center), and then      reuse them. The plastic corks that come in those lovely      champagne bottles are reusable too ... but only for a few      times before the ridges around the stoppers become so worn      and mashed down that the corks won't positively reseal      anymore.    </p>    <p>      The plastic wrap and rubber bands I've specified will be      used as air traps or air locks. Sure, you can buy "real"      winemaking glass or plastic locks (with the nifty little      water trap inside) for "only" 35 to 50  cents each. That      doesn't sound too bad <em>one at a time ...</em> but, for      the fivegallon batch of fermented joy we're going to be      making, you should have at least eight of the little      beauties on hand. And, if you ever plan to have more than      one vat of wine going at a time ... you can see that your      total investment in air locks "only" 35  cents a shot-can      quickly mount up.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, there's a very simple and inexpensive way      around this problem. Because, after all, what is an air      lock anyway? It's nothing but a trap that lets the gas      generated by the yeast in a developing bottle of wine      <em>out ...</em> while refusing to let the outside air      <em>in.</em> And a 10-inch square of plastic wrap placed      loosely over the mouth of a gallon jug and secured with a      doubled rubber band will do that job as well as anything.    </p>    <p>      <em>Don't pull</em> the sheet of plastic tight and      <em>don't</em> go crazy doubling up your rubber bands. (The      tighter the bands, the more pressure it'll take to stretch      them enough to let the generated gas out ... and, if the      plastic is taut enough, there's always the chance it'll      rupture before the bands stretch.) <em>Do</em> make sure      the film of plastic is caught under the doubled band all      the way around the jug's neck. Then, as pressure builds in      the container, the band will have to stretch a little to      let the gas out ... and you'll have a positive seal at all      times so that no outside air can get in with the wine.    </p>    <p>      This plastic wrap trap, by the way, is not a new idea ...      and it does have one significant advantage over even the      most expensive water-type trap: When left unattended for a      long period, the water can evaporate from its, trap and      leave your wine unprotected. The plastic wrap trap, for all      practical purposes, is unaffected by time.    </p>    <p>      I've saved the most important item of equipment till last      ... because a good hydrometer is an absolute necessity for      anyone who expects to make quality wine      <em>consistently.</em>    </p>    <p>      Hydrometers seem to intimidate a great many people, and      they shouldn't. The simple little instruments are nothing      but handy-dandy devices that measure the density of      liquids, and the one you'll be using is no different than      the hydrometer your local garage mechanic uses when he      tests the strength of the battery acid and antifreeze in      your car.    </p>    <p>      Some winemaking hydrometers are nothing but a sealed and      weighted, graduated tube that is floated right in a vat or      bottle of wine. Others consist of [1] the sealed, weighted,      graduated tube inside [2] a hollow, transparent cylinder of      glass or plastic which has [3] a short length of tubing on      its bottom and [4] a squeeze bulb on the top. By squeezing      the bulb, dipping the tubing into a liquid, and then      releasing the bulb ... a quantity of the fluid can be drawn      into the instrument's main cylinder. And this will cause      the little weighted tube inside to float higher or lower in      the liquid, depending on the fluid's density. It's then      very easy to read one of the graduated scales on the side      of the floating tube where it sticks up out of the liquid,      and thereby determine the specific gravity of the fluid      being tested.    </p>    <p>      For instance: The specific gravity scale (marked "S.G.") on      a hydrometer is set up so that plain, ordinary water      <em>-</em> when tested <em>-</em> will give you      a reading of 1.000. Any fluid that is "thicker"      <em>-</em> say a solution of water and sugar-will      cause the indicator tube to float higher and yield a higher      specific gravity reading. But if we convert some of the      sugar in that solution to a "thinner" liquid such as      alcohol (pure alcohol has an S.G. of only about .800),      we'll lower the specific gravity of the fluid we're testing      <em>in direct proportion</em> to the amount of change that      takes place.    </p>    <p>      What this means, of course, is that we can use a hydrometer      to tell us exactly how much sugar to add to a given amount      of water to produce <em>-</em> months later      <em>-</em> precisely the percentage of alcohol we      want in a finished batch of wine. We can also use the      instrument to monitor the wine's progress during its      development and "fine tune" the fermentation as it goes      along.    </p>    <p>      Complete instructions come with a new hydrometer and I      recommend buying one (instead of borrowing) if you plan to      make a lot of wine. They only cost about $2.25 apiece new      here in Eugene, Oregon, and a good one will last you      forever (or until you get careless and drop it).    </p>    <p>      Two final points about reading a hydrometer: First, make      sure the little weighted tube inside is floating freely      (give the instrument's cylinder a "spin" between your      fingers, if necessary, to shake off any bubbles that might      be clinging to the scale inside) before you try to read it.      And make that reading with your eye exactly level with the      top of the solution in the cylinder. Second, remember that      the density of a fluid changes with temperature. Thus, your      hydrometer will be strictly accurate at only one      temperature (most winemaking S.G. testers are calibrated      for 68° F). The variations you'll be dealing with won't      be enough to worry about, though, as long as you make some      effort to test your wine only at something close to this      standard temperature. (if your wine has been stored at-say      <em>-</em> 40°, let it warm to room temperature      before you test it.)    </p>    <p>      And that's it for the equipment. Everything you'll need      <em>-</em> even if you have to go out and buy it all      new-should cost you only about $20. And everything is      reusable.    </p>    <h3>LET'S MAKE SOME BLACKBERRY WINE!</h3>    <p>      Blackberry is my favorite homemade wine, so let's start      with that one. (The recipe will work for all berry wines.)      you'll need:    </p>    <p>      15 pounds of blackberries<br />      1/2 cup of raisins<br />      1/2 teaspoon of ascorbic acid (vitamin C)<br />      5 gallons of water<br />      1 tablespoon of acid blend (or the juice of one      lemon)<br />      10 pounds of sugar<br />      1 package of dry wine yeast<br />      <br />      If your fruit has been sprayed, wash it. Otherwise, don't.      Then crush the berries to release their juice. I like to      squash mine by filling a two-gallon flat-bottomed bowl or      pot (stainless steel or enamel) half full of berries and      then mashing them firmly with my knuckles (the way a      gorilla holds its hands when it walks). If you prefer, of      course, you can squeeze the fruit by the handful ... but I      find the knuckle method faster. Either way, if you use      rubber gloves you're missing half the fun.    </p>    <p>      Once you've turned your berries to mush, empty them into      the nylon sack while you hold the bag over your eightgallon      plastic can. Squeeze the sack gently against the side of      the can to force the free juice from the pulp ... then fill      the two-gallon bowl half full of berries again, mash them,      add the new pulp to the mass already in the sack, and so      on. Repeat until all the fruit has been crushed and all the      pulp is in the bag. Then dump in the raisins, tie the top      of the sack closed, and leave it in the can with the fruit      juice.    </p>    <p>      Add the ascorbic acid next. (if you can get it, the pow      dered form of the vitamin is less expensive than tablets.      And, to assure myself that my wine is as "natural" as I can      make it, I use only powdered vitamin C made from rose      hips.) The purpose of the ascorbic acid, by the way, is to      prevent the wine from oxidizing and changing color when      it's later exposed to air and light.    </p>    <p>      OK. Now you're ready to heat five gallons of water almost      to boiling and add it to the fruit juice in the      eight-gallon can. (The hot water will kill most of the wild      yeast and bacteria in the juice and pulp and keep them from      competing with the wine yeast that you'll soon introduce to      the must. There's no need, however, to boil the juice and      pulp to make them absolutely sterile, since boiling would      set the pectin they contain and make your wine difficult to      clear later.)    </p>    <p>      Empty in the acid blend next. This is a powdered mixture of      three naturally occurring acids (tartaric from grapes,      citric from citrus fruits, and malic from apples). Any      winemaking supply house will have it in stock and-if you      have no such store in your town-you can write to Wine Art,      Head Office, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and ask      for a mail-order catalog and the address of the firm's      nearest outlet.    </p>    <p>      In a pinch, you can substitute the juice of one lemon for      the acid blend. It'll work about as well, although wine      made with the straight citric acid will be somewhat more      susceptible to oxidation than a batch made with the blend.      Do add the acid in one form or the other, however, or your      wine will be rather flat and insipid.    </p>    <p>      Once the acid is in, it's time for the sugar and a test of      your expertise with the hydrometer. Pour in about twothirds      of the 10pound bag of sugar, vigorously stir the solution      in the big primary fermentation vat to dissolve the      sweetener, cover the can with a towel, and let it cool to      room temperature. This will take about ten hours or so, and      I find it easier to prepare my must up to this point just      before I go to bed at night. By morning, it's nice and      cool.    </p>    <p>      When your must has reached room temperature, check its      specific gravity with your hydrometer. Then add a little      bit of sugar at a time, stir the must until the sweetener      has dissolved, and again test the solution's specific      gravity. Stop when the little bulb in the hydrometer floats      at the 1,095 mark. (Unless your blackberries are really      ripe, you'll use most of the rest of the sack of sugar. And      if you accidentally overshoot the S.G. you're after, don't      worry. Just add enough water to bring it back down to 1.095      ... a level which will produce a wine that contains about      14% alcohol by volume.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, once you've adjusted the sugar to your      satisfaction, you can sprinkle the dry yeast      <em>-</em> straight from its foil packet      <em>-</em> onto the surface of the must. DO NOT STIR.      Some of the yeast will sink directly to the bottom of the      can and most of it will float. That's fine. Let the yeast      do what it wants to do.    </p>    <h3>PRIMARY FERMENTATION BEGINS!</h3>    <p>      Within 12 hours, more or less, you should start to see      obvious signs of fermentation. Small bubbles will begin to      form a circle of foam a few inches in from the wall of your      <em>Vat.</em> Any yeast that is still floating will be      surrounded by this foam and there will be a distinctly      heady smell in the air.    </p>    <p>      Now that the fermentation is under way, you should stir the      must twice a day with something made of wood (never metal!)      such as an old broom handle. Punch down the bag of pulp a      few times while you're at it. And always re-cover the big      can of fermenting must with the towel to keep dust and      fruit flies out.    </p>    <p>      Check the specific gravity of your fermenting brew at least      once a day, and keep a record of the developing wine's S.G.      As the yeast eats the sugar, it will produce carbon dioxide      and alcohol. The gas will bubble off as it forms, but the      alcohol will remain in the must. And <em>-</em> as      you already know <em>-</em> as the quantity of sugar      decreases and the amount of alcohol increases, the specific      gravity of the must will drop. When the S.G. reaches 1.030,      that's your signal to transfer the wine into closed bottles      for secondary fermentation    </p>    <p>      Why <em>closed</em> bottles? Because, up to this point, the      yeast organisms were very active and were producing enough      carbon dioxide to cover the surface of the must. The minute      fungi are beginning to slow down now, though, and      <em>-</em> from this time on <em>-</em> they'll      steadily release less and less of the gas. Which means that      it's only a matter of time until oxygen will be able to      reach the must unless it's otherwise protected in some way.    </p>    <h3>ON TO SECONDARY FERMENTATION!</h3>    <p>      Wash eight of the nine one-gallon jugs super-clean.      <em>Dont use soap.</em> (It leaves a film that's almost      impossible to rinse away.) If some deposits are stuck      really hard in one of the containers, swish a handful of      gravel around in its bottom. If that doesn't do the trick,      throw the jug away and get another one. Rinse each      container several times with cold water.    </p>    <p>      Squeeze the bag in the primary fermenter until the sack is      completely dry (it'll be much smaller than when you put it      in). Then throw away the pulp, rinse the bag in clean      water, and hang it where it will stay dry until you want to      use it again.    </p>    <p>      Stir the must and sediment together in the primary vat and,      using a cup or bowl as a ladle, fill each of the gallon      jugs <em>to the shoulder</em> with the mixture. Don't be      tempted to fill the containers any higher than their      shoulders. The yeast may be slowing down, but it contains      enough "kick" to produce some foam yet ... and you must      leave enough space for it. If there's still some of the      fermenting brew left in the primary vat after the eight      jugs have been filled shoulderhigh, ladle the excess into      any available container that <em>-</em> shoulder      <em>-</em> high-will hold it. Then cap the eight jugs      and the extra container with plastic wrap and rubber bands      as I've already outlined.    </p>    <p>      As soon as you've sealed the secondary fermentation jugs,      rinse out the original plastic can with plenty of clean      water. Immediately is not too soon to handle this job: If      you leave it until later, the residue in the vat's bottom      will be doubly hard to remove. So take care of the task      now, and then store the can in an airy place until you're      ready to start another batch of must.    </p>    <p>      The nine secondary fermentation jugs should be covered in      some way to keep light from reaching their contents. Some      home vintners tape a newspaper around each of the bottles,      but I find that it's easier to turn a grocery bag upside      down over each one. Whatever, keep the containers in the      coolest spot you can find (a dark cellar is ideal).    </p>    <h3>RACKING</h3>    <p>      When the foam has disappeared from the surface of the must      in the gallon jugs, you should rack (siphon off) the green      wine into clean containers.    </p>    <p>      Rinse out the ninth gallon jug (the one you haven't used      yet) and run clean water through your siphon hose. Then      place the first gallon to be racked off up on a chair or      table and set the empty jug beneath it on the floor. Stick      one end of the plastic tubing beneath the surface of the      must in the upper jug and <em>-</em> keeping your      head lower than the liquid <em>-</em> gently suck on      the other end of the hose. Then, before the must reaches      your mouth, cap off the end of the tubing with your thumb.      (If you're not quick enough with this last step, you'll get      a mouthful of must. Don't worry about it. It's good for      you.)    </p>    <p>      Now you're in business. Bring the thumb-capped end of the      hose to the mouth of the lower jug and, while you take care      to keep the other end of the tubing beneath the surface of      the liquid in the upper jug, remove your thumb and start      the siphon. As the lower container begins to fill, push      that end of the hose down beneath the surface of the      accumulating wine (this minimizes the exposure of the must      to the air).    </p>    <p>      When the upper jug is almost empty, slowly tilt it toward      you and draw the last of the wine off its sediment.      <em>Make sure that you don't accidentally stick the tube      into those dregs.</em> As the first bit of sediment begins      to sneak up the hose, pull t e ubing from the upper jug.      (This whole siphoning operation is much easier when done by      two people.)    </p>    <p>      All right. Carefully rinse the jug you've just emptied,      siphon the next filled one into it, and so on. If you plan      to start a new batch of wine within the next day or so, you      can use the sediment in any of the bottles to inoculate the      new must. Just put a few teaspoons of the culture in a      closed jar and keep it in the refrigerator until you need      it.    </p>    <p>      This time around <em>-</em> unlike the last      <em>-</em> you'll want to fill each of your gallon      containers to within an inch of their rims. (Fermentation      is over and there's no longer any danger of the wine      foaming up.) After racking, you should find yourself with      approximately five and a half gallons of wine on your      hands. Put the odd half gallon into the half-gallon jug in      on your equipment list, seal all six containers with      plastic wrap and rubber bands, and store the jugs in a cool      place.    </p>    <p>      Rack the wine again after three weeks and again at the end      of three months (or, if it has already cleared, at the end      of only two months). Your blackberry wine will then be      ready to put into bottles.    </p>    <p>      FIRST AID FOR UNCLEAR WINE    </p>    <p>      Although it's never happened to me, there is a slim chance      that your wine won't have cleared at the end of even three      months. If that's the case, your best cure for the problem      is time. Given enough of that magic ingredient, almost any      wine will eventually lose its haze (some apple wines      habitually take as long as a year to clear).    </p>    <p>      If you feel that you can't wait your must out, you can      sometimes clear a wine by presenting it with a large      surface area of something <em>-</em> traditionally,      wood <em>-</em> for its particles of haze to settle      on. Try boiling some oak chips for a few minutes, draining      them, and then putting a couple of tablespoons of the      shavings into one of the gallon jugs. The chips of oak      should [1] help clear the wine, [2] mellow it, [3] darken      the must and give it character, and [4] add a distinctive      oak flavor to the brew. Although the addition of the      shavings should speed the wine's clearing, it will still      take time for the haze to settle. So taste the wine every      few weeks to see if the oak taste is becoming too strong.    </p>    <p>      Beechwood shavings or chips <em>-</em> which won't      add any taste to your must <em>-</em> can also be      used to clear a stubborn batch of wine. Again, add a couple      of tablespoons per gallon and leave them in until the wine      clears ... or you give up.    </p>    <p>      Yet another way to settle the haze out of your bottles      involves the use of egg whites (which have been pressed      into service for this purpose for centuries). Whip up one      egg white per gallon of wine and pour it into the jugs. As      it drifts to the bottom, particles of haze will adhere to      the whipped white. Shake each jug gently once a day for a      week or two until the wine has completely cleared.    </p>    <p>      None of the methods I've outlined here are foolproof and      you'll find that some wines simply will not clear unless      they're filtered. To heck with filtering. Just drink the      wine as it is. The haze won't affect its taste in any way      ... just its visual appeal.    </p>    <h3>BOTTLING</h3>    <p>      Next to drinking, bottling is the best part of winemaking.      Your fresh batch of the beverage <em>-</em> finally!      <em>-</em> doesn't look or smell so bad anymore. It's      even beginning to taste pretty good! Hey, this is all      right! Bring on the bottles.    </p>    <p>      But first, you'll want to make absolutely certain that all      the action of the yeast is over. Just looking at the wine,      or tasting it, won't tell you. But your trusty hydrometer      will. If it reads below 1.000 S.G. (my blackberry wine      always tests .995 after two months) and your wine is      acceptably clear, you're safe. It really is time to bring      on the bottles.    </p>    <p>      Wash your twenty-five wine bottles thoroughly with a bottle      brush and plenty of water. If you don't have a brush, use      gravel again as you did with the gallon jugs.    </p>    <p>      Next, mix up a weak bleach solution (a couple of teaspoons      of laundry bleach in a pint of water) and rinse each of the      containers with it. Then rinse each one at least twice      again with clean water.    </p>    <p>      I assume that your bottles are each the standard      fifthgallon containers common in the United States. If so,      the five gallons of wine (with maybe a little over) that      you probably racked at the. end of two or three months will      just fill all 25 of your bottles to within an inch of their      tops.    </p>    <p>      Start your siphon and begin the filling. You can, if you      ,like, shell out $1.50 or so for a fancy little shutoff      valve that will allow you to stop the flow of wine as you      move from bottle to bottle. It's simpler and less      expensive, though, to just fold the hose in your hand and      crimp it down whenever you want to slow or stop the stream      of wine.    </p>    <p>      When the bottles are full, seal them with the plastic caps      <em>...</em> and that's it. If you like the taste of your      creation as is, you can begin drinking it immediately. Or,      if you find the new wine still a little green, just store      it away in a cool and dark place and try it again in about      two months. You'll probably find it much smoother and far      less astringent at that time.    </p>    <h3>VARIATIONS ON THIS RECIPE</h3>    <p>      The blackberry drink we've just made is a dry wine. . .      which means that almost no sugar remains in the beverage      after it has fermented. The wine, in short, is not sweet.    </p>    <p>      If you prefer a sweet wine, there are a number of ways to      alter this recipe (by killing the yeast early with cold or      chemicals or adding so much sugar that the yeast dies from      the concentration of alcohol before the sweetener is all      gone). Most are beyond the scope of this article.    </p>    <p>      There is, however, a very easy way for a home vintner to      serve sweet wines. Just make up a solution of half water      and half sugar. Heat it until it clears and then allow it      to cool (so that it will remain in solution), and keep it      in a pretty decanter on the table for anyone who wants to      sweeten his or her wine to taste. Honey, of course, may be      used in the same way <em>...</em> but stick with the milder      tasting light honeys and use only about half as much (since      honey is much sweeter than sugar).    </p>    <h3>AND VARIATIONS ON THE FRUIT THAT      GOES IN</h3>    <p>      Once you realize how easy wine is to make, you'll probably      want to try whipping up a batch or two from other fruits      (and vegetables). No problem.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER BERRIES.</strong> The basic recipe I've just      given you for blackberry wine will work with <em>any</em>      berry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>APPLES AND PEARS.</strong> Use a whole ounce of the      vitamin C (since this fruit oxidizes so easily) and      sprinkle it right into the pulp as you crush it. That      crushing, by the way, is easier done with some sort of      pestle since apples and pears are a little tough on the      knuckles. A wooden pestle is ideal, but I usually just use      a jar filled with water (don't ram it into the fruit and it      won't break). Go easy, though, when you use any kind of      tool to crush your fruit. Seeds contain tannin, which can      make a wine taste harsh (the idea, then, is <em>not</em> to      break up the seeds). Other variations on the basic recipe      for apple or pear wine: Use a ratio of five pounds fruit      for each gallon of water and add one and a half (instead of      just one) teaspoons of the acid blend.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHOKECHERRY OR ROSE HIP.</strong> Use two pounds of      fruit for each gallon of water and one teaspoon of acid      blend.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEETS, PARSNIPS, AND CARROTS.</strong> Try three      pounds of any one of the vegetables per gallon of water and      use two teaspoons of the blend.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GRAPES:</strong> Ah ha! The perfect fruit for wine.      Forget the recipe, if you have California grapes, and add      nothing at all (not even water or acid blend) except the      sugar you need to bring the must to 1.095 S.G. Native      American wild grapes are a little different: Thin them by      half with water, and add sugar until you have a specific      gravity reading of 1.090. The wild grapes need no acid      blend.    </p>    <h3>THE REST IS UP TO YOU</h3>    <p>      For more wine recipes than you'll probably ever try, get a      copy of the booklet, <em>Brother Vintner Country Wines</em>      from Wine Art (see address included in the discussion of      acid blend in this article). Or truck on down to your local      bookstore or library for copies of <em>The Winemakers      Companion</em> by Bernard Turner, <em>The Art of Making      Wine</em> by Stanley Anderson, and/or <em>Wine and Beer      Making Simplified</em> by H. Bravery.    </p>    <p>      The rest is up to you. Just remember that <em>-</em>      even at $2.60 per 10-pound bag of sugar <em>-</em>      your homemade drink will cost you only about 12  cents a      bottle out-of-pocket. And remember, too, that you'll never      know how many friends you have ... until the word gets      around about the good wine you're turning out. Skoal!    </p>
