               <p>      Two or three years ago in this magazine, Michele Sevin      explained the ins and outs of the natural candy business.      (See "How To Start Your Own Natural Candy Factory", MOTHER      NO. 29, pages 36-38.) Now Michele's back to tell us      how it's possible to make $20 a day and more by blending,      bottling, and selling a nutrition-packed apple/nut "milk".    </p>            <p>      We've discovered how to combine fresh almonds with apple      juice to create a non-dairy milk that's fantastically good      tasting. It's also chock-full of essential vitamins, amino      acids, enzymes, minerals, and fruit sugars ... and ripe      with home business possibilities, too! To show you what I      mean, I'd like-if I may-to tell you how Michael      and I happened onto almond milk, and how we reaped a      "healthy" profit selling the drink to health food stores in      and around Vancouver, British Columbia.    </p>    <p>      It all started one cold, rainy November day shortly after      Michael and I had returned-penniless-to      Vancouver following a summer of nomadic wanderings in      Cinnamon, our VW van. I'd had-and was able to      endure-a sporadic throbbing in one of my eyeteeth for      quite some time, but upon our arrival home the pain had      become agonizing and unbearable.    </p>    <p>      The next day we went to see the dentist, who looked into my      mouth and promptly prescribed $250 worth of root canal      work. "No way!" Michael exclaimed ... and that was the end      of that.    </p>    <p>      So-rather than spend money we didn't have-I      immediately embarked on a cleansing fast and scoured the      herbal guidebooks for alternate methods of dealing with      tooth problems. I ended up with a dental plan that included      the following: a calciumand silicon-rich tea made from      horsetail, oat straw, and comfrey leaves (to nourish the      gums and teeth) ... a mouthwash-and      poultice-containing powdered myrrh and goldenseal,      for their healing and antiseptic qualities ... chaparral      for pain ... and a tea of specially blended herbs, rich in      B vitamins, to nourish and build nerve tissue. (These herbs      included-among others-black cohosh, catnip,      cayenne, hops, lady-slipper root, lobelia, mistletoe, red      clover, skullcap, valerian, and wood betony.)    </p>    <p>      Over the next few days my face swelled "out to here" and      the pain became excruciating, but finally-to my      immense relief-an abscess broke through the gum and      drained. Ten days of "herbal therapy" later, the swelling      had completely subsided and my tooth stopped throbbing. I      felt weak ... but the worst was over.    </p>    <h3>THE ALMOND MILK      "DISCOVERY"</h3>    <p>      On the night of my "recovery", I spied some almonds in the      house    </p>    <p>      where Michael and I were staying. I found the nuts-to      say the least-powerfully alluring. "Michael," I said,      "do you think I could have some almonds?"    </p>    <p>      "Absolutely not," he replied. "That'd be too much chewing,      and anyway almonds are too heavy a food for you to break      your fast with."    </p>    <p>      "Perhaps you could make a nut butter out of them in the      Champion juicer," I suggested. And Michael did ... but the      ground almonds-while easy enough to swallow-did      feel quite heavy in my stomach. In an attempt to remedy      this situation, Michael put a few spoonfuls of almond      butter in the blender along with some apple juice ... and      produced a beverage that was light and strengthening, and      as satisfying as the creamiest malted milkshake!    </p>    <p>      I doubt if Michael slept a wink that night. "Look," he      whispered, waking me up, "Suppose we sell 'almond milk' at      the health food stores. Think of it! It could do wonders      for babies ... or nursing mothers!"    </p>    <p>      "Or anyone," I added.    </p>    <p>      Fifteen minutes later-after I'd dozed      off-Michael woke me again to say that perhaps the      drink's flavor could be enhanced by the addition of      cinnamon and nutmeg. And fifteen minutes after that he had      yet another great idea. (This one-sided conversation went      on all night.)    </p>    <p>      The next day, we made up a batch of apple/nut milk to sell      at the neighborhood natural food store ... and it was a      rousing success! We offered samples in little cups, and      watched with delight as everyone in the store partied on      the creamy, rich beverage. (The cashier-who hailed      from eastern India-asked us if we'd ever been to      Benares. "There," he told us, "people make a drink      consisting of almond milk and a little hashish . . . .")    </p>    <p>      A day later, our leftover nut milk was as fresh tasting as      when it first left the blender (although the      "cream"-as with fresh cow's milk-had risen to      the top). That's yet another of almond milk's many virtues:      It never seems to go bad ... even after a <em>week</em> in      the refrigerator!    </p>    <p>      Since our initial "discovery" of the beverage, we've done      some experimenting and come up with a few improvements to      the basic almonds-and-apple-juice recipe. For example,      we've found that-just as Michael had thought from the      beginning-cinnamon and nutmeg <em>do</em> enhance the      drink's taste. (A touch of vanilla helps, too.)    </p>    <p>      Also, we decided to include sesame tahini in the milk to      both improve its flavor and boost its calcium content.      (Sesame tahini, incidentally, is a creamy spread made by      blending together a tablespoon and a half of lime juice,      six tablespoons of water, onehalf cup of finely ground      sesame seeds, and a teaspoon each of oil and dried kelp.)    </p>    <p>      Our justification for the sesame tahini went something like      this: The body uses <em>both</em> phosphorus AND calcium to      build teeth and bones ... and an excess of either mineral      in the diet leads to excretion of that mineral. Yet we know      that almonds <em>contain twice as much phosphorus as      calcium.</em> By adding sesame tahini (which is rich in      calcium) to the drink, then, we strike a balance between      phosphorus and calcium . . . leading to more efficient      utilization of both nutrients by the body.    </p>    <p>      Likewise, we later added Brazil nuts to our recipe, since      they contain an extra essential amino      acid-methionine-and thus add something to the      milk's protein content.    </p>    <p>      The result of all this is that we now have a      nutrition-packed "nut nog" that's as vitalizing as it is      delicious. (A few of the many nutrients contained in the      juice are listed in Table 1.)    </p>    <h3>YOU CAN MAKE IT TOO</h3>    <p>      Almond milk is easy to make ... all you need in the way of      "special equipment" are a grain mill and a blender. (We've      found that for home use, the Corona handoperated corn mill      $17.50 from the R & R Mill Company, 45 West First      North, Smithfield, Utah 84335-does a very      satisfactory job of grinding almonds, sesame seeds, and      Brazil nuts.) Strictly speaking, though, you don't really      even have to have a mill. We've found that if we let the      almonds soak overnight in apple juice, it's possible to      whip up a batch of "milk" solely with the aid of a blender!    </p>    <p>      To make about five quarts of almond milk, all you have to      do is blend together the following ingredients:    </p>    <p>      [1] One gallon of organic apple juice<br />      [2] Approximately 2 to 2-1/2 pounds (about 4 to 5 cups) of      almonds, either finely ground or in the form of a nut      butter<br />      [3] One-half pound (7 to 8 tablespoons) of finely ground      sesame seeds or 4 to 5 tablespoons of sesame tahini<br />      [4] One tablespoon of Brazil nuts, finely ground or in the      form of a butter (optional)<br />      [5] One tablespoon of powdered cinnamon<br />      [6] One tablespoon of powdered nutmeg<br />      [7] One tablespoon of vanilla<br />      [8] One tablespoon of lecithin (optional).    </p>    <p>      After blending, strain the milk and bottle it. (Note:      Refrigerate the juice as soon as possiible, unless you      intend to drink it right away.)    </p>    <p>      We usually decant the 160 ounces of rich, creamy liquid      into two quartsized (32-ounce) bottles and six pintsized      (16-ounce) bottles, which we then sell to the health food      store for $2.25 per quart or $1.15 per pint. (The quarts      and pints retail for $2.85 and $1.55, respectively.)    </p>    <p>      Our "per batch" cost breakdown (all prices are wholesale)      goes something like this:    </p>		    <p>      Obviously, the batch cost could be reduced further if we      recycled the pint containers, but this isn't always      possible. (Usually, though, we <em>are</em> able to reuse      the quart bottles.)    </p>    <p>      We sell the 160 ounces of nut nog to stores for $11.40 (two      quarts at $2.25 each plus six pints at $1.15 each). So you      can see that our profit per five-quart batch comes to an      even $5.00 ... which ain't bad for about two hours' work.      (Remember, this is the kind of "work" you do in your own      home, at your own pace, while you sip juice and make small      talk with a friend.) <em>Your</em> profit could be      considerably higher, if you could get one or more      ingredients-the apple juice, say-at a lower cost.    </p>    <h3>VARIATIONS ON THE      BUSINESS</h3>    <p>      Anyone going into the nut nog business in a big way would      probably be wise to convert the almonds and Brazils into a      finely ground butter prior to making up batches of milk.      This does two things: It eliminates the need for (and time      spent on) a straining step, and it makes the nuts go a bit      further (since you don't end up straining out-and      throwing away-tiny nut fragments).    </p>    <p>      Michael never stopped experimenting with different versions      of the milk and-as a result-our nut nog never      came out the same way twice. One of Michael's most      brilliant gastronomic achievements-and something      you'll want to try yourself-was his nondairy yogurt.      Simply [1] buy a package of yogurt (or kefir) starter at      your local health food store, [2] sterilize a quart bottle,      [3] heat some unstrained almond milk to 180° (too hot      to touch, but not boding), then [4] when the milk has      cooled to room temperature, pour it into the sterile      container and add the yogurt or kefir starter. Store the      liquid at room temperature for 24 hours, and voila! Almond      milk yogurt! (Hint: To make more yogurt, repeat the above      procedure using three tablespoons of almond yogurt in place      of the starter.)    </p>    <p>      We also occasionally make a scrumptious "chocolate almond      milk" by adding roasted carob powder to the basic milk      recipe. (Invariably, this was-when we were making      it-our best seller. You should've heard the "oohs"      and "aahs" whenever we walked into the store carrying      armloads of chocolate nut milk!)    </p>    <p>      Another variation that's definitely worth trying is      carob-mint almond milk. Just add five drops of pure      peppermint oil extract to a pint of carobflavored nut nog,      shake, and pour. (You've got to taste it to believe it!)    </p>    <p>      So there you have the story: the complete story-in a      nutshell-of how Michael and I got hooked on almond      milk. We've made a healthy profit selling this healthful      beverage, and there's no reason why you can't do the same.      All you really need are almonds, apple juice, a blender,      and a little determination. (Plus, perhaps, an aversion to      $250 dental bills!)    </p>
