                <p>      <strong><em>Before you spend upwards of $1,200 for a team of      oxen</em> - <em>or several times that for a      tractor</em> - <em>let Robin Thistle of South      Hazelton, British Columbia tell you about . . .</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      As I recently re-read John R. Scarlett's suggestions for      using oxen on the small farm (see "The Organic Experimental      Engine", MOTHER NO. 21, page 44), it occurred to me that my      own experiences in this area might be useful. Useful, at      any rate, to those of MOTHER's readers who're interested in      running a few acres as naturally and economically as      possible.    </p>        <p>      Anyone who's ever owned draft animals knows that there's      one big drawback to keeping horses, mules, oxen, etc.:      namely, the beasts tie up a considerable quantity of      valuable land, while producing only a modest amount of      power and manure. Now, on a 100-acre farm where a great      deal of draft power is required, this expenditure may be      justified ... but on a tiny farmstead where every square      foot of land is needed, it's just not practical to devote      precious acreage to the upkeep of draft animals.    </p>    <p>      There is an "easy way out" of this dilemma, of course: buy      a tractor (and add to the world's problems by fueling it      with petroleum products). That's not a very satisfactory      solution, however, economically OR ecologically.    </p>    <p>      Another very real alternative - although seldom      thought of by most people - does exist, however, and      to introduce it I'd like to step back to the mid-1960's and      recount a bit of personal history.    </p>    <p>      A decade ago, I made my living as a small milk producer in      the hills and dales of North Yorkshire, England. My      "spread" totaled 35 acres, most of them steep and craggy.      Since I've never personally liked tractors (I despise them,      in fact), all the everyday work around that farm was done      with the aid of Peggy, my Clydesdale mare ... whose main      duty was to haul 30 gallons of milk to market every day      across three-quarters of a mile of steep, rough road. (All      heavier farmwork - baling and such - was left      to local contractors.)    </p>    <p>      One early Christmas morning, as the frosty sky was      beginning to brighten in the east, I set off with Peggy up      the steep road to town with two churns (each containing 15      gallons of milk) secured to my flatcart. The last steep      stretch of the country road I traveled twisted between high      banks and hedges before joining a paved thoroughfare into      the village. We were halfway up this hazardous section in      the morning's dim light before I realized that -      ahead of us - water had run out from the side ditch      and frozen across our path. Rather than try to back down      the hill as I should have, though, I decided to risk going      the rest of the way up.    </p>    <p>      What a mistake <em>that</em> was! Peggy missed her footing      on the ice and fell, breaking one of the cart's shafts.      Luckily, I managed to free the horse from the wreckage and      carry the milk cans - one at a time - up the      last few yards of the track on my back. My beloved mare,      however, was now lame ... and I was faced with the prospect      of having to pack 100-pound cans all the way to town on my      back every morning in order to get the milk to market.    </p>    <p>      At this point, I didn't know what I was going to do. It so      happened, though, that I'd recently read a farming textbook      of the early 1830's which contained a treatise on draft      animals. In this treatise, oxen were given equal billing      with horses, and the author of the piece even went so far      as to point out the usefulness of <em>dairy cattle</em> (if      they're well on in their lactation) as work animals.      Moreover, the author maintained that unless a cow was      already giving a great deal of milk, the exercise obtained      from light work was likely to increase - not decrease      - her production.    </p>    <p>      Well, no sooner had I recalled this treatise than I hit      upon-and set out to implement-the idea of harnessing one of      my own cows to do the work that Peggy had been doing.    </p>    <p>      I selected Miranda-a middle-aged Ayrshire-as the most      suitable subject for my experiment since, in addition to      being quiet and halter-broken, she was neither giving a      great deal of milk nor was she too heavily in calf.    </p>    <p>      "Poor Miranda," I thought. "This is going to be difficult      for both of us." (I didn't expect breaking a cow to harness      to be easy ... probably because I'd been brainwashed into      believing that horses are draft animals, while cattle are      for milk and meat, and only backward people work oxen      anyway).    </p>    <p>      I couldn't have been more wrong! Compared to breaking a      horse - and I've trained several for draft work in my      time - harnessing Miranda was a cinch. And she has      since proven no exception to the rule: All my subsequent      experience has only confirmed my belief that if a cow has      been thoroughly halter-broken, leads well, and is quiet and      friendly ... she should take to draft work like a pig to      mud.    </p>    <p>      Here's how I went about training that first cow to work: I      began by haltering Miranda and slipping an open-necked      horse collar down onto her neck. (If you don't have an      open-necked collar, you can slit a closed one open at the      top ... the hames will hold it together.) An open collar is      necessary because even if she doesn't have horns, a cow's      head is too broad to fit through a regular horse collar.    </p>    <p>      I put the collar on upside down (that is, in what would be      an upside-down position for a horse) for the simple reason      that a cow's neck, looked at from a horseman's point      of<br />      view, is upside down: thick at the top and thin at the      bottom. It's true that with the collar inverted, the trace      hooks are at a much higher position than they would be on a      horse, but this is all right. The point of draft on a cow      <em>should be</em> higher than for a horse.<br />      <br />      A pair of trace chains and a backband completed Miranda's      gear.    </p>    <p>      At this stage, I led the old gal around the yard to let her      become accustomed to the collar and to the swinging of the      chains against her sides. She seemed completely unbothered      by her new outfit.    </p>    <p>      Next, I brought out an old iron bed and fastened a length      of heavy cord to it. I made sure the rope was long, so that      when I walked beside Miranda and she dragged the bed behind      her, it wouldn't catch her heels. The purpose of this      exercise was to see if Miranda would be frightened when a      strange object began following her around. She wasn't. (Nor      was she upset when I turned her about, and caused the cord      to tighten against her hind legs.)    </p>    <p>      Now there was only one question left to answer: Would      Miranda pull a load? To find out, I took from the cart      house a lightweight sled I'd made the winter before,      attached a small singletree to it, brought Miranda around,      hooked her traces to the singletree just as if she were an      experienced workhorse ... and urged her forward. The chains      tightened, and lo! the sled began to move. Good ole Miranda      stepped out as though she'd been working all her life!    </p>    <p>      The next morning, I yoked my new "draft" animal to the sled      once again, drew up at the dairy door long enough to load      up and tie down the usual two cans of milk, and drove off.      When I gave Miranda her head, she not only laid into the      collar on steep hills without urging, but picked her way      around icy spots in the road without a slip.    </p>    <p>      I need hardly say that the village was agog when I drew up      at the milkstand that day. As far as I know, there were-at      the time-no other working cattle in the whole of the      British Isles, apart from a single team of Herefords in the      south. To many of the farmers on hand, my appearance with a      cowdrawn sled brought back memories from 50 years or more      before, when cattle were more widely worked. I was treated      to tales about the day the bull dragged a cartload of      turnips through a hedge, and told about how donkeys and      bullocks could once be seen working side by side.    </p>    <p>      Later, when snowy weather arrived, I was faced with the      problem of how to keep my chain-drawn sled from running      into Miranda's heels as we went downhill. I learned of      several possible ways to do this. One is to sling a skid      chain around the sled's runners to increase its gliding      friction. Another method - which I used at first      - is to walk behind the load and hold the light sled      back with a rope. (This was a less-than-ideal procedure, as      I could easily have lost my footing and let go of the      line.)    </p>        <p>      The best technique - and the one I eventually settled      on - involved putting a pair of shafts on the sled.      As luck would have it, I had a pair of small shafts from a      pony lorry which I was able to fit to the sled in such a      way that the bars could swing up at any angle. Leaving her      inverted collar on, I outfitted Miranda with a light float      harness that fit her reasonably well, and then hitched the      sled's new shafts to the harness. With this rig - and      with the aid of breeching (a leather strap around her      hindquarters )- Miranda was in complete control of      the sled even on the steepest downgrade. (The constriction      of the shafts bothered her no more than had the sled on the      first day.)    </p>    <p>      Eventually, I broke other members of the herd with almost      equal ease, and - to lighten the beasts' workload      - I even began to yoke my cows in tandem (one behind      the other). The rearmost animal would be in between the      shafts to steady the load when we went downhill, while the      front cow - whose traces were hooked onto loops at      the tips of the shafts - gave extra pulling power on      the upgrades.    </p>    <p>      I've never harnessed two cows abreast, as I would two      horses, for the simple reason that the animals might      - especially if they have horns - injure each      other. Naturally, though, the way to overcome this problem      would be to use a yoke, but that's a piece of equipment I      have no experience with. (I've always had sufficient horse      gear around and found that it served my purposes      admirably.)    </p>    <p>      Ever since learning how to harness a cow, I've never (if I      could avoid it) used a heavy horse to pull a load in icy or      snowy conditions. For Miranda - and others after her      - taught me that a cow is, in many ways, much more      nimble and safe than a farm horse (or even most ponies).      Left to themselves, cattle will pick their own way over a      treacherous stretch of road with ease ... and, if they      should fall, they don't come crashing down with the      momentum of a 2,000-pound shire horse.    </p>    <p>      From a single animal, then, it's possible to have not only      milk, and a calf to raise for meat (if you're so inclined)      ... but draft power for various jobs around the farm: light      plowing, harrowing, carting, sledding, log skidding, etc.      Most of the equipment you'll need for hitching up your cow      - including some of the harness - can be      homemade (mine was), and you can train the beast yourself.    </p>    <p>      So, before you rush out and spend a couple thousand dollars      for a team of oxen - or worse, a tractor-at least      give a passing thought to the triple-purpose cow. Treat her      well, don't ask her to pull more than she can handle ...      and she'll serve you faithfully with milk, meat,      <em>and</em> a helping hoof.    </p>
