                   <h3>    IT TELLS YOU HOW    </h3>    <p>      <em>Here are a few of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) sydicated      features which have appeared ijn 100+ newspapers over the      past three and a half years.</em>    </p>        <p>      Right now, Mother Nature is providing the wise gardener      with all the good compost and soil building materials he      could ask for . . . free for the gathering!    </p>    <p>      Raking leaves is an old autumn ritual that involves the      whole family. And one of the easiest ways to haul those      leaves to the compost pile is with a goodly section of      recycled canvas or worn out bed sheet.    </p>    <p>      Clear an area the size of your tarp and spread the canvas      out flat. Then simply rake the surrounding leaves onto the      sheet, pile them in its center, fold over each comer to      trap the heap and tote it to the compost bin. For best      results shred the leaves before adding them to the pile.    </p>        <p>      Government and energy industry spokesmen are predicting      severe fuel shortages in some areas of the U.S. and Canada      during the coming frigid weather. If you haven't already      done so, then, this is definitely the time to "batten down      the hatches" for winter.    </p>    <p>      A special committee for the Office of Consumer Affairs has      reported that storm windows can conserve enough heat      anywhere north of Richmond, Virginia to pay for their      installation within 10 years plus return an annual 6%      dividend on initial cost. That's at current fuel prices. As      the expense of oil, coal, gas and electricity increases      (and it will), those extra windows will justify their      expense in even less time. And if you really can't afford      double glazing? Relatively in expensive weatherstripping      and caulking applied around all the doors and windows on a      house can cut a family's annual heating bill by as much as      <em>15 to 30%.</em>    </p>    <p>      The OCA paper further states that six inches of insulation      applied over the ceiling of a home's top floor will pay for      itself <em>in one year</em> in Richmond, Virginia or any      other location that has an average winter temperature of      45° F or lower. Prevent warmed living-space air from      leaking up into the attic and you'll greet spring with even      more unspent dollars in your pocket.    </p>    <p>      And once you've chinked your dwelling and every room is as      snug as a bug, try wearing a sweater in the house and      setting your residence's thermostat two to four degrees      lower than the temperature you've come to consider as      "normal". Once again, you'll save fuel (and money)      and-according to the British, at least-be      healthier during the coming months to boot.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      YOU CAN MAKE SHORT'NIN' BREAD    </h2>        <p>      At one time or another, nearly every one of us has sung      that song ... but how many people do you know who have      actually <em>eaten</em> short'nin' bread? Very few. How      often, in fact, have you even seen a recipe for short'nin'      bread? Probably never.    </p>    <p>      It was with great interest, then, that I recently noted the      formula for genuine, down-home short'nin' bread in what was      left of an old spiral-bound copy of something called      <em>Charleston Receipts.</em> I know nothing more about      this book, since the first 12 and the last      I-don't-know-how-many pages are missing ... but I'm      guessing that it's a "vanity" cookbook published      approximately 20 years ago in Charleston, South Carolina.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, I found-on page 161 of the      collection-Mrs. Henry F. Church's recipe for      short'nin' bread. I've tried it, it's good (in a Lorna      Doone cookie sort of way) and here's how you can make your      own:    </p>    <p>      Cream one-quarter pound of soft butter and one-fourth cup      of light-brown sugar. Add one and one-half cups of flour      and roll the mixture out quickly about one-half inch thick      on a floured board. Cut the dough with a small biscuit      cutter and bake on a lightly greased and floured cookie      sheet for approximately 20 minutes at 350° F.    </p>    <p>      Eat the little cookies hot or cold ... and you'll know why      mammy's little baby really <em>did</em> love short'nin'      bread!    </p>
