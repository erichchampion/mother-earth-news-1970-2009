                    <h5 id="byline">     by JUDITH FEIGER    </h5>    <p>      Flies, stray pets, and rats are attracted to compost piles      like mosquitoes to murky water . . . especially when the      rotting heap in question contains raw garbage. Fortunately,      we've never had a rat problem, but we <em>used</em> to be      troubled by all other kinds of pests whenever we put      kitchen wastes on our compost pile.    </p>        <p>      The heap itself consisted mainly of dried vegetation and      aged manure that'd been run through our shredder-grinder to      speed decomposition. And these      wastes-alone-didn't draw many pests. Any time      we put <em>fresh garbage</em> on the mound, however, we      soon saw our backyard invaded by cats, dogs, and flies ...      and the vastly increased "earthy" smell wrinkled our      neighbors' noses.    </p>    <p>      At first, we attempted to remedy the situation by putting a      fence around the compost pile. This discouraged a few of      the smaller dogs in the neighborhood ... but it did nothing      to eliminate the other pests (let alone the pungent odor).    </p>    <p>      We also tried burying the garbage in the pile ... a      technique that took care of the flies, cats, and wrinkled      noses (and all but the hungriest hounds). I wasn't fond of      having to dig into the compost every time I wanted to dump      my garbage, though, and the fence we'd erected earlier      didn't make my shoveling any easier.    </p>    <p>      And then we visited my husband's Uncle Byron (who happens      to be an avid organic gardener with more years of      experience than I have fingers and toes). And Uncle Byron      showed us how he turned garbage into fertilizer without      attracting vermin: He simply loaded his refuse into either      of two bottomless galvanized-steel trash cans which he'd      buried upright in the ground (only the tops of the cans      were visible).    </p>    <p>      "All I have to do is put my garbage in one trash can until      it begins to fill up," Uncle Byron explained, "which      usually takes a few months. Then I start putting garbage in      the second barrel. By the time <em>that</em> container's      full, the material in the first can has been converted to      compost and is ready to be used in the garden."    </p>    <p>      Uncle Byron showed us the contents of the two buried trash      receptacles. One was filled with what looked-and      smelled-like fresh household garbage ... while the      other contained beautiful, rich, humus-like material. Not      far away was a compost pile which-my husband's uncle      told us-contained "digested refuse" from the second      can. It was completely pest- and odor-free.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, when I got home I was anxious to try Uncle      Byron's "double barrel" approach to composting. First, I      rounded up a pair of trash cans and made an opening in the      bottom of each. (The best way to do this is to have a      welder cut the entire bottom out with a torch.      Alternatively, several large punctures will suffice for      drainage purposes.) Then I buried the two barrels in the      ground, leaving just enough of their rims showing so that I      could fit snug lids on them (see photograph). And without      further adieu, I began to empty my kitchen garbage into one      of the two steel compost "Pits".    </p>    <p>      The virtues of the new system were immediately apparent.      Cats, dogs, and flies were shut out ... while odors were      shut in. At last, no more pests! Maggots <em>did</em>      appear once-after we put fish innards in the      can-but the heat generated by natural biodegradation      killed off the little varmints before they could develop      into adult flies. (Various "trash can" insecticides exist,      but I can see nothing to recommend them. And besides, even      though Maggots ARE repulsive I don't mind them spending      their short lives working the soil in my subterranean      composter!)    </p>    <p>      It seemed like forever (actually, it was four months)      before that first small can was completely full. The      container might be brimming with garbage one day ... and it      might be down to a third of that amount a few days later.      (in hot weather, the wastes seemed to "melt" like ice.)      Finally-when the barrel was nearly filled to      capacity, and stayed there-I mixed in a shovelful of      manure to help speed decomposition ... then I closed the      lid tight and let nature take its course.    </p>    <p>      In the meantime, I started dumping garbage into the second      can. And-Sure enough-long before it was full,      the first container's contents had turned into rich, black      compost, ready to be spread on the garden or used to      top-dress our flowering plants.    </p>    <p>      A bonus we hadn't counted on, by the way, was      <em>earthworms.</em> The little squirmers were attracted to      the barrels in droves and-after coming in through the      openings in the cans' bottoms-kept themselves busy      working the rotted garbage into a black, meallike      fertilizer (which proved, once again, that worms are every      bit as much a blessing to gardeners as to fishermen).    </p>    <p>      We're happy to report-thanks to our "underground      composter "-that we no longer have any problem with      pests, our neighbors never look at us with wrinkled noses      anymore, and we now have a garbage disposal that'll never      choke on a bone or add a cent to our utility bill!    </p>
