    <p>
                    <p>      I'll admit, when you first hear about it, that the idea of      building a full-sized house of <em>paper</em> -and      then living in it-sounds absurd. But it really can be      done. And such a structure <em>can</em> be cozy, strong,      weatherproof, and permanent.    </p>    <p>      The Japanese have been making vertical wall panels and room      divider screens from paper for centuries ... but I wanted      to go that one better. What I wanted to try to do was      construct a <em>complete</em> house of paper. A house that      <em>anyone</em> could build ... at extremely low cost ...      using very few tools (and no <em>special</em> tools at all)      ... without any forms or scaffolding. A house that would      last at least 10 years.    </p>    <h3>      SO I PICKED MY BASIC CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL ...    </h3>    <p>      Corrugated paper board stock-or "pasteboard", as it's      commonly known-was my first choice for the structure      I wanted to build. It's easy to handle, very light in      weight, available in a variety of colors and textures, and      cuts, bends, and folds nicely. It can also be glued, taped,      stapled, and fastened together in many other ways. And      besides that, its price is quite reasonable ... even when      you have to buy it.    </p>    <p>      Of course, a dedicated scrounger probably would never allow      himself or herself to lay out cold, hard cash for      pasteboard. The material usually overflows industrial and      manufacturing sites, and city dumps always seem well      stocked with it.    </p>    <p>      Indeed, I originally intended to scrounge the corrugated      board stock for the house you see here. But it was already      September and winter was coming on fast when I finally      freed myself enough to start on the structure. So, in the      interest of expediency, I purchased everything that went      into the building. Still, the total materials      package-including foundation and insulated floor but      not including plumbing and interior cabinetry-came to      only $1.25 a square foot. Imagine how little you might      spend on a house like this if you have a talent for      recycling other people's castoffs!    </p>    <p>      There is a bewildering variety of pasteboard stocks      available. The ultimate strength (bursting strength) of      each depends on the number of layers of corrugations or      "flutes" in the board, the type of glue used to hold it      together, and the thickness of the layers of paper from      which it is made. Try to get pasteboard made with      waterproof or water resistant glue and stay away from      cardboard that has been coated with wax (since the wax will      repel any glue or waterproofing you might try to add      later).    </p>    <p>      The pasteboard I chose is called "Tri-wall" and it's made      with three layers of flutes and fairly heavy outer paper      surfaces. It's slightly over one-half inch thick and has a      bursting strength of 1,100 pounds. I'm sure the board is a      bit overengineered for the structure I built and the house      could easily have been constructed of double-wall material.    </p>    <p>      If you use the more ordinary cardboard which has only a      single layer of flutes, try to scrounge up pieces that are      flat and which have no bends or folds in them.      Then-making sure several inches separate any joints      in one layer from joints in the others-use white      (Elmer's or comparable) glue to cement the boards together      into your own triple-thickness pasteboard. All exposed      joints should then be sealed with nylon-reinforced paper      tape and the laminated boards placed under something      flat-such as a sheet of plywood-wiih weights on      top until the bonding glue dries. (It really doesn't matter      which direction the flutes of your laminated panels run,      but the boards will be a little easier to work with if all      the corrugations are lined up in the same direction.)    </p>       <h3>      ... AND I DESIGNED A HOUSE    </h3>    <p>      If you expect to use pasteboard to its maximum advantage as      a building material, you must both use your boards properly      and incorporate them into a structure that is inherently      strong.    </p>    <p>      It quickly becomes obvious to anyone who experiments with      them that the shape of a conventional "box" house is very      weak ... so ranch styles and bungalows made of paper are      definitely out. A spheroid shape, however, is both      inherently strong (loads applied to any point on a spheroid      tend to be distributed and shared by the whole surface) and      efficient (a sphere beats all other geometric shapes for      enclosing the most space with the least surface area). In      other words, if we consider only the materials being used,      a sphere-or part of one-is the ideal shape for      a house constructed of paper.    </p>    <p>      In human terms, however, a sphere isn't nearly so ideal.      Even if you slice one right through the middle horizontally      (and place a floor there so it will have the maximum      possible area), there's still a lot of wasted space towards      the top of the dome you have left. And, since the walls of      that dome curve in at the top all the way around, it can be      difficult for the people inside to walk on or otherwise use      the outside two or three feet of the dome floor's "rim"      without bumping their heads.    </p>        <p>      So I took an ordinary hemisphere and modified it by"pushing      down" the top and "bulging out" the sides to make the      living space inside reasonably efficient for people. The      shape which resulted is basically known as a catenary and      is very pleasing. It also distributes any stress on the      building's skin quite nicely without allowing the force to      become concentrated at any one point.    </p>    <p>      I chose "pie shaped" panels for the construction of my      hemisphere, instead of the triangles normally used in most      of today's domes, because that was simply the easiest way      out. It would have been extremely difficult and time      consuming to calculate and then keep track of the exact      shapes and lengths of all the differently sized triangles      that I would have needed for the "squashed" building. I      would also have wasted a lot of time andmaterials      fabricating and joining the more than 100 odd-shaped      triangles that the structure would have required. By using      just one template to make 24 identical panels, however, I      neatly sidestepped all those problems. True, the dome      sections I wound up with are just big enough to put them      beyond comfortable one-man size (especially outdoors in any      kind of wind). But they are not at all heavy and handling      them-once you learn to do it without bending the      panels-is no real problem.    </p><p><em>Who says a guy can't build and live in a house made    out of paper? Larry Self constructed this attractive, strong,    weatherproof "flattened dome " out of triple-thick corrugated    cardboard, using a minimum of tools, at a cost of only $1.2.5    per square foot.</em></p>        <p>      As constructed, my house is 25 feet across (at      approximately waist height) and nine and half feet tall in      the center. The building works well and gives you no sense      of confinement when you're inside. It's also quite an      efficient structure, since its floor is just 24 feet in      diameter ... a size that can be constructed from 4 X 8      sheets of plywood with very little waste. (The scrap from      this whole project, in fact, filled only three 20-gallon      trash cans ... and was all "recycled" in my fireplace.)    </p>    <p>      You may wish to construct a house smaller or larger than      this to suit your particular needs. If so, you can adjust      the thickness of the pasteboard in the building's walls      accordingly. I'm confident that Tri-wall can be made to      span greater distances and that pasteboard can be used to      good advantage on other shapes. Just avoid large, flat      areas in your design.    </p>    <p>      HERE'S HOW WE BUILT IT    </p>        <p>      All floor, shell, and door sections for the dome were      prefabricated in a shop and moved to the construction site      by truck. The prefabbing took about a month of part-time      work and actual construction approximately 10 days. Half of      all this time went into work with the pasteboard panels.,    </p>    <p>      The only tools we used were scissors, knives (of the      Stanley or Red Devil type with extra blades), saw, hammer,      two-and four-inch paint brushes, large "C" clamps, shovel,      posthole digger, and level.    </p>    <p>      Each of the 24 main pasteboard wall panels was 38 inches      wide (plus flanges) at the widest point, and 17 feet long.      We used a total of 37 sheets of 4 X 12 Tri-wall in their      construction and every panel was made in two sections and      spliced together (the overlapping splices added to their      strength). All flanges are six inches wide, except at one      place along the lower part of each panel where they were      held to a width of five inches. By alternating where the      V-shaped notches occurred in the flanges, it was possible      to overlap them to form a solid stiffener rib along the      line where any two of the pasteboard panels are joined      together.    </p>    <p>      The "pie shaped" or "orange peel" panels were outlined from      a pasteboard template and then cut out by hand. We found we      got much cleaner cuts and that the work went a great deal      faster when we kept razor-sharp blades in our knives at all      times. We also developed a preference for lightly scoring      each marked line first and then going over it several      times-making a little deeper cut with each      pass-until our blades were all the way through the      Tri-wall. If you try it, cut against a sheet of plywood or      similar material for best results.    </p>    <p>      We used a small metal eyebolt screwed into the end of a      piece of wood (try an old broom handle) as a scoring tool      when we bent up the flanges on the pasteboard panels. Try      it. After a little practice, you'll find that you're able      to draw the rounded end of the bolt precisely along the      line you want to fold in one smooth, continuous motion ...      and get the depth of the score just right while you're at      it. (Use too little pressure and the fold later will be      hard to make and may wander from where you want it. Bear      down too hard and you run the risk of punching through the      cardboard. Five minutes of practice on some scraps, though,      should put you right in the groove you're after.) Once the      pasteboard is scored, it's a simple matter to bend it      against the straight edge of a piece of wood.    </p>        <p>      Although white glue is just the ticket for laminating      together "homemade" panels of Tri-wall, the only adhesive      we used in the final construction of our dome was contact      cement. This is the "stick-um" that cabinet shops use for      holding counter tops in place and it grabs "like crazy"      when two surfaces that have been properly coated with the      stuff are allowed to touch each other. Follow the      directions on the cans, make sure you've got plenty of      ventilation, and don't smoke when you use the cement.    </p>    <p>      We thinned our first coats of the adhesive so they'd      penetrate the pasteboard better, and then we applied a      fullstrength second coat of the cement to every surface we      planned to glue. (Allow plenty of drying time between      coats. In fact, if you like, you can apply the first      coating to the panels as you make them and the second only      a couple of hours before your dome's final assembly.)    </p>    <p>      I used just over six gallons of contact cement in the      construction of my house . . . but I did spread it on      rather liberally. You should be able to get by with less.      However much you do use, though, <em>make absolutely      certain you have everything lined up just the way you want      it before you press two cement-coated surfaces      together.</em> Once they're stuck, they're stuck!    </p>    <p>      My paper house was constructed on fairly flat ground (with      a slope of about seven inches in 24 feet). The only      foundation we used was concrete blocks turned on end and      placed at each major intersection of the building's floor      beams and treated posts set around the dome's      circumference. This was done not so much to "hold the      structure up" (the whole pasteboard shell weighs less than      600 pounds and the floor tips the scales at about 1,500) as      to give the extremely lightweight house some "roots" to      hang onto in high winds.    </p>    <p>      Strangely enough, the load problems we had to solve for      this domed dwelling dealt with <em>lifting,</em> rather      than <em>settling.</em> Due to the building's aerodynamic      shape, its downwind side tries <em>to pick the structure      up</em> in a high wind! So fasten those pasteboard panels      down and fasten them well if you build one of these houses.      I nailed the bottoms of my dome's sections to the      building's floor temporarily until we had the shell      completed. Then we made minor corrections by pushing the      panels' bases in and out (to make the building's floor      perfectly round and centered on its platform), and      then-with reinforcing batten strips installed over      the panels' bottom flanges-really spiked the sections      down permanently.    </p>    <p>      The floor under my paper dome consists of a 2 X 4 beamwork      grid, filled with fiberglass insulation, and covered on the      bottom with 3/16" and on the top with one-half inch      plywood. All the pieces of lumber used in the grid are less      than eight feet long and it should be easy to scrounge      someif not all-of the 2 X 4's. The placement of the      beams is a little complicated (and you may wish to use a      simpler, more conventional layout for your joists) but it      is extemely effi cient with materials and does make a very      strong floor.    </p>        <p>      Fortunately, on the prototype, all our precut floor joists      fit beautifully and none had to be recut or spliced. Soon      after construction of the floor had begun, however, the      winds became so strong that we had to install some of the      light fiberglass insulation in the platform by moonlight      (after the winds had died for the night). I've heard of      moonlighting on a job ... but this was ridiculous.    </p>    <p>      The winds blew even stronger on the day we started putting      our 17-foot panels up and I thought we'd lose some of them      for sure. It was a pleasant surprise, then, when the first      three pasteboard sections of the dome withstood winds of 35      miles per hour with gusts up to I don't know how much. I      was impressed by the panels' strength.    </p>    <p>      I was also impressed when we tried to join the flanges of      the first two panels. I had assumed we could just force      them against each other with our hands ... but we had to      use short pieces of wood on each side (to protect the      pasteboard from being crushed) and "C" clamps. This whole      clamping assembly had to be moved from the floor all the      way to the top of the dome as each set of matching flanges      were successively brought into contact with each other. It      was hard work, but it made a very strong rib down along the      edges of each panel.    </p>        <p>      The building's 24 ribs (which, of course, are all turned to      the inside of the dome) terminate at the center of the      "roof" in a 32-inches-in-diameter pasteboard ring. A      temporary pylon was set up in the middle of the house and      the ends of the panels were secured to it until we had      enough of them up to make the dome's skin self-supporting      and rigid enough to resist the wind.    </p>    <p>      A template-cut to the proper curvature for the      finished wall of the dome-was fabricated from scrap      plywood and moved from rib to rib as the panels' flanges      were glued together. This helped us make sure that the      house's skin had exactly the same shape all the way around      and, once the building was up, we got more use out of the      template by nailing it into position as an interior wall.    </p>    <p>      The outside of each pasteboard joint was covered with a      four-inch-wide strip of cloth which was pulled as tightly      as possible to remove all wrinkles and sags and then glued      on. -The material helps carry stress loads across the      joints and gives the dome a smoother appearance. I used a      combination polyester/cotton fabric which both-thanks      to the polyester has a great deal of strength      and-thanks to the cotton-accepts glue nicely.      (Nylon and other synthetics would have been stronger, but      they wouldn't accept the cement we used.) The strips of      cloth were also used as reinforcement around the bottom of      the dome, around the framing for the door, and around the      hole in the center of the building's roof.    </p>    <p>      The top of the dome was finished off with a sheet metal      cap. The low-profile cone-which is centered on that      32-inches-in-diameter pasteboard ring I mentioned      earlier-has a six-inch stovepipe running up through      its center. This keeps the hot pipe isolated from the      pasteboard of the building's skin and protects the      structure from fire.    </p>    <p>      We installed the dome's door last and that probably gave us      more trouble than anything else we did. (It's a whole lot      handier putting that final panel in place and gluing it to      its neighbors if <em>you already have</em> a door somewhere      else in the wall so you can run in and out.)    </p>        <p>      It's quite important that the door of any dome be very      strongly framed so that it will successfully carry stress      loads AROUND the hole in the skin. This has been the      ruination of some of the structures, since-compared      to the smooth, flow ing, unbroken surface of the rest of      the building-the opening for the door is a definite      weak spot around which stresses tend to accumulate.    </p>    <p>      A rounded overhang over the door and protective panels down      its sides, while not entirely necessary, are nice extra      touches (they help keep the wind out and protect you from      water runoff as you enter and leave the house).    </p>    <p>      We kept our door opening small, for a couple of reasons:      [1] I wanted to limit heat loss and gain inside the      structure to an absolute minimum, and [2] I also wanted the      door assembly to fit within a single panel and not reach      over into a second. As a result, the opening of the      building's door is 24 inches wide and 72 inches high.    </p>    <p>      "Porthole" windows (which were added after the accompanying      photographs were taken) are also small-twelve inches      in diameter-to reduce heat loss and gain. As little      as they are, however, we find them quite adequate and they      let in all the interior light we could want.    </p>    <p>      The whole house was protected from the weather with vinyl      caulking which was applied to each joint (before the      cotton/polyester strips went on) as the panels were glued      together. The entire shell was then given two coats of      varnish (the first was cut 50% with thinner), followed by      three coats of mobile home roofing compound.    </p>    <p>      The roofing compound has an asphaltic base to which      asbestos, glass fibers, and aluminum powder have been      added. It goes on easily (almost like thick paint) and I      reached the top of the dome by setting a ladder up in the      center of the building and leaning out the hole in the      middle with a brush on the end of a stick.    </p>    <p>      Just as the last of the compound was being put on ... it      started to rain. Perfect timing! We sat inside the dome and      felt very cozy as we listened to the drops hit its skin.      The only real noise we could hear was the wind blowing      around the top of the chimney.    </p>    <p>      Once the house was up, neighbors came from miles around to      see that "thing" which looked like it had just landed.      "Sorry," we had to tell them, "there's no little green men      here ... just Larry Wheat (the fellow with the whiskers in      some of the photos) and Lawrence Self."    </p>    <p>      The walls of the building have now been insulated and an      interior pasteboard shell is being added to finish off the      inside and make the structure even stronger. I also plan a      special heating and cooling system for the building ...      using the constant temperature of underground well water, a      solar water heater, and wind-powered electrical generator.    </p>    <h3>      IN CLOSING    </h3>    <p>      There have been pasteboard storage cabinets, files, and      even furniture on the market for quite some time ... and      believe that this project now demonstrates that the      material can be used for the construction of complete      houses. Houses that are environmentally sound ... at least      to the extent that they're fabricated of an absolute      minimum of the earth resources. Houses that can be      constructed of recycled castoff materials and which,      themselves, are recyclable in turn.    </p>    <p>      And perhaps even more important to many of us, I think I've      now proven that-with a knife, some glue, and a stack      4 scrounged-up pasteboard boxes-you too can have a      low-cost mortgage-free house of your own!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you would like detailed construction      drawings of Larry Self's paper house, send $15 to Larry      Self, 1318 Cloverdale, Richardson, Texas, 75080.
