                        <p>      To the tourist visiting the Southwest for the first time,      strings of red peppers drying in the sun are a colorful      sight. To the fruit and vegetable ranchers whose riverside      farms stretch along the valley cut by the Rio Grande      between Santa Fe and Taos, New Mexico, the sight is such a      familiar one that they seldom give it a second thought. For      in this part of the country (and southward), the peppers      are planted, grown, and harvested in abundance as a staple      food.    </p>    <p>      In the accompanying photo, Connie Garcia sits amidst the      peppers and pumpkins grown by her parents on their ranch      near Velarde, New Mexico. Each string of peppers will fetch      about ten dollars on the open market ... sometimes more,      sometimes less.    </p>    <p>      While they may taste unbearably "hot" to easterners, the      fruit of the pepper plant seldom brings tears to the eyes      of native New Mexicans, who-young or old, Indian or      AngloSaxon-eat these spicy relatives of the bell      pepper as a vegetable, health food, and condiment.    </p>    <p>      Tourists and native New Mexicans alike agree that the      brightly colored peppers-which festoon buildings and      Indian pueblos every year at this time-add a welcome      touch of color to life in this desert area.    </p>
