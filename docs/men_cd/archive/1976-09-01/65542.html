           <h5 id="byline">by JACK RYAN</h5>        <p>      Would you believe me if I told you that I've been shaving      with the same Gillette Platinum-Plus razor blade every      morning ... for about a year? It's true! And it doesn't      look as though that blade needs to be replaced even yet.    </p>    <p>      No, I don't own a plastic pyramid and I don't believe that      the "power of the universe" flows through me or my home.      There's no magic in what I've done . . . I've just found a      way to make my razor blade last a good deal longer than      normal. Here's how:    </p>    <p>      Each morning, I begin by washing my face with plenty of      ordinary soap and water. After rinsing off, I then      immediately lather my beard from my shaving mug and start      shaving. When I've finished, I wipe excess soap off my skin      with a very wet washcloth (a process which re-moistens my      face) . . . then I shave again, this time pulling my razor      in the opposite direction. Afterwards, I rinse and go about      my business.    </p>    <p>      I liken my technique to the double-lather procedure most      folks use when washing their hair. The first dab of shampoo      doesn't <em>appear</em> to do much (it certainly doesn't      produce much in the way of suds) . . . but when you rinse      and lather up a <em>second</em> time, the suds billow. The      soap with which I wash my face before shaving is analogous      to the first dab of shampoo: It doesn't <em>appear</em> to      do anything ... but I think that in fact it must loosen or      remove a water-repellent layer of dirt and grease, after      which the shaving cream can really get in and wet the beard      (sort of like the second application of shampoo). A      thoroughly wet beard, of course, is softer than a barely      moist one ... and thus doesn't require as sharp a cutting      edge.    </p>    <p>      To test the above theory, I decided several months ago to      see what would happen if I <em>skipped</em> the pre-wash      altogether. Ouch! I could feel the blade practically pull      each whisker out by its root! After rinsing my kisser and      lathering up again, however, the same blade did a      supersmooth job of cutting.    </p>    <p>      I've also noticed something else: Namely, on mornings when      I use too much water in my pre-wash or in my shaving mug,      my face definitely tells me that the blade should be      chucked in the trash. But the next day-if I go      through my normal routine and use the right proportion of      soap to water-the ole face says that everything's      fine.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, the year-old blade I'm using now isn't as      sharp as a brand-new one ... but it does a commendable job      on my beard nonetheless (and I don't nick myself nearly as      much as I would with a fresh-out-of-the-package blade).      Besides that, it's surely a lot easier to use this one      razor blade over and over than to sharpen a straight razor      every morning like I used to have to do.    </p>    <p>      I suppose I really should buy a new pack of blades, make      careful observations, keep accurate records, and document      this phenomenon in some sort of halfway scientific manner      ... but what the heck? The way I figure it, why should I      buy new blades before I have to? Especially when my trusty      year-old Platinum-Plus is still going strong!    </p>
