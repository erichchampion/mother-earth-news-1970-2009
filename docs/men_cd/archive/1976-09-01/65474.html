                    <h5 id="byline">     by PHYLLIS HOBSON    </h5>          <p>        Glamorous Greta is a goat. She has languid brown eyes,        two-inch-long eyelashes, and droopy, white-tipped ears        that frame her face like Cleopatra's hairdo.      </p>            <p>        Greta is an aristocrat by birth. Her family background is        far better than ours and she never misses an opportunity        to remind us of the fact. She never begs to be petted ...        she <em>allows</em> us to rub her head. When we call, she        never comes running up the hill with the rest of the        goats ... she ambles our way <em>leisurely,</em> as if by        accident.      </p>      <p>        We bought Greta at our price-by        default-because her dam was bred out of season.        That made her an "only" kid and people who raise large        herds of goats don't like to make all those long trips        out to the barn just to feed one kid. But we didn't mind.        We <em>enjoyed</em> the trips to the barn because we knew        that each one took us just a little closer to the time        when Greta would repay us with rich Nubian milk.      </p>      <p>        And she does. Greta now manufactures copious amounts of        creamy milk. But she doesn't "give" it. Greta doesn't        "give" anybody anything. She <em>manufactures</em> milk        and the rest is up to you. If you want it, you must take        it by force.      </p>      <p>        For despite her regal bloodlines and her aloof manner,        Greta has one small flaw that makes milking her a        twice-a-day struggle. Certain parts of her body are        ticklish. Incredibly, ridiculously ticklish.      </p>      <p>        Greta will stand quietly with her Roman nose in the air        and allow you to rub her ears. She'll even stretch in        ecstasy as we scratch her neck. And she loves to have her        back brushed. But one touch of the human hand anywhere on        the underside of her body and she's off in kicking,        yelping hysterics.      </p>      <p>        But I didn't know that until I first tried to milk her.        Which would have been bad enough with an unticklish goat        because, at the time, I had never milked one of the        animals before and I was more concerned with the        inadequacies of the milker than of the milkee.      </p>      <p>        Did you ever notice that there's no place close to your        farm where you can go to learn to milk a goat? I began to        notice that . . . right after we bought Greta.      </p>      <p>        There are schools which offer courses in sewing, radio        repair, and how to make rugs out of scraps of cloth.        There are training programs that will teach you to handle        dogs and horses. There are books on building backyard        barbecues. But if you want to learn to milk a goat,        you're on your own. (Wrong, <em>Phyllis. MOTHER NO, 15        carried explicit instructions</em> - <em>with        diagrams</em> - <em>on how to milk a cow . . .</em>        <em>which is exactly the same as milking a goat.</em>        - <em>MOTHER.)</em>      </p>      <p>        So, while Greta and I awaited the arrival of her        firstborn, I checked the libraries, the bookstores, the        magazine racks. I even searched through the goat        publications. Every one assumed that I already knew how        to milk.      </p>      <p>        I finally asked a nearby dairy farmer for lessons and he        demonstrated his milking technique on a docile,        cudchewing brown and white cow. She never moved a muscle        as he, with what seemed effortless ease, guided a stream        of milk into the pail.      </p>      <p>        It looked easy, so I sat down on the stool ... and        suddenly realized, from that angle, that the cow was        <em>huge</em> (by far the largest animal I had ever sat        under). I gingerly took hold of two teats (ole Bossy        stopped chewing her cud and turned to look at me). I        squeezed (nothing happened). I squeezed again (I could        feel milk being forced back up into the udder). Bossy's        left leg jerked. I got up! "You just need some practice,"        said the farmer. "You won't have any trouble. Anyone can        do it."      </p>      <p>        I wasn't as confident as my adviser ... so I searched        through every book on goats that I could find. Each        talked about sanitation, about the layout of the milking        room, about whether or not to feed an animal during        milking, about chilling and straining the milk. And each        ended with a variation of the same theme: "Attach milking        machine at this time."      </p>      <p>        Finally, in an ancient and very elementary volume        (written for youngsters) about the care of a family cow,        I found what I was looking for. It was only one small        paragraph, but it was enough to get me started. "With        reasonable pressure with the right hand," the book said,        "squeeze in the second finger, then the third, and then        the little finger. Relax and repeat the action with the        left hand."      </p>      <p>        Now I at least knew what I was supposed to do ... but I        had nothing to practice on. So-whenever I was alone        and thought no one was looking-I wrapped my hands        around the teats of an imaginary goat and squeezed ...        second finger, third finger, little finger. First one        hand and then the other. It became a reflex action.      </p>      <p>        And then the Great Day came. I went out one morning and        there, in Greta's stall beside her, was the most        beautiful little buck kid I had ever seen. His ears were        long and spotted with white. His coat was like velvet. He        had lashes that stood out an inch from his face and he        loved to nuzzle chins. We had our herd sire. Besides        that, It <em>was time to milk Greta!</em> Time to try out        my newly learned skill!      </p>      <p>        Everything was ready . . . the freshly painted milking        stand, the shiny new stainless steel milking pan, the        spotless milk pail and its cover. I drew a container of        warm water, picked up a cleaning cloth, and headed for        the barn.      </p>      <p>        My favorite goat book had said, "The goat will eagerly        jump up on the milking stand." But, apparently, Greta        hadn't read the book. After fifteen minutes of coaxing,        pushing, and finally-bodily lifting her, however, I        did manage to get Greta up on that stand. Then I set a        bowl of grain in front of her and watched as she        cautiously inserted her head through the keyhole        stanchion. Greta sniffed the grain suspiciously ... then        took a bite.      </p>      <p>        This was more like it! I sat down on the milking stool,        dipped my cloth in the warm water, and began to wash the        goat's udder just as my book had instructed.      </p>      <p>        Yipes! One touch of my hands and Greta pulled her head        back through the keyhole, jumped off the stand, and ran        yelping down the aisle of the barn!      </p>      <p>        So I caught her, lugged her back, lifted her up on the        stand again, and <em>tied her securely</em> so she        couldn't jump down again. But she jumped off anyway, and        pulled the milking stand over as she went.      </p>      <p>        By the time I had Greta on the stand for the third time,        I had decided that milking a goat was definitely not a        one-woman operation. So I brought in two assistants and        stationed one at each end of the milking stand to hold        Greta where I wanted her. (We were both trembling with        frustration by this time.) Then I sat down, pail in hand,        for the Main Event.      </p>      <p>        Now I've never been dexterous (I was the only child in my        kindergarten class who couldn't master the "pat your head        and rub your tummy" trick) and I haven't improved with        age. Although my right hand did fairly well with the        "squeeze in the second finger, then the third, then the        little finger" routine ... my left one just couldn't seem        to get the hang of it. It could squeeze out the milk all        right ... but it had trouble hitting the bucket. Instead,        it rather vaguely aimed its stream across the room, into        my eyes, and onto various parts of the new milking stand.      </p>      <p>        And with every squeeze, Greta jumped three feet into the        air and came down kicking. At the end of 45 minutes, she        was exhausted and I had less than half a cup of very        dirty milk in my pail. But I had won! Greta was milked.      </p>      <p>        We're doing better now, of course. Greta has learned to        accept the ritual with resignation, if not with grace.        Maybe it's because I've rewritten the instructions on        milking. They now go something like this:      </p>      <p>        "In case the goat is ticklish, fasten her collar securely        to the <em>wall</em> -not the milking        stand-so she cannot jump down. Then grasp both hind        legs firmly with the left hand and butt her against the        wall with your head. Hold her there. Then, using the        right hand only, squeeze in the second finger, the third        finger, and the little finger. Relax and repeat the        action."      </p>
