                    <p>      "Everybody talks about the mountains of old tires that      constantly stack up in the industrialized nations," Mark      Twain might say if he were still alive, "but nobody does      anything about them."    </p>        <p>      Nobody, that is, but Karl-Ernst Kerkhof of Alfstet (near      Bremerhaven), Germany. Mr. Kerkhof decided he'd both [1] do      the environment a good deed by disposing of surplus used      tires, and [2] cut down on the consumption of roofing      materials ... by, as you've probably guessed, finding a way      to substitute the first for the second.    </p>    <p>      And he did. Kerkhof has now patented a method of cutting      the sidewalls away from the tread portion of an old tire      ... and then using as many sections of tread as he needs to      cover a roof. As the accompanying photograph shows, Mr.      Kerkhof alternates upside-down strips of the rubber with      rightside-up bands all the way across the surface he's      covering. What the picture does not show is his "secret"      way of gluing the long, rubber "tiles" together and the      fact that he uses only rust-free nails to fasten the      flexible "shingles" to the structure underneath.    </p>    <p>      "There's no doubt about it," says Karl-Ernst Kerkhof. "This      roofing will outlast most present-day houses and      buildings." Which is, perhaps, the reason that Mr. Kerkhof      has already shingled a number of new homes in his part of      Germany with his rubber tires. . . ah, tiles ... ah, with      his patented strips of roofing.    </p>
