        <h3>Clever Coop Design</h3><p>After reading many of your chicken and egg articles, my 13-year-old daughter designed this mobile chicken tractor (see Image Gallery) and my husband built it.</p><p>Our 11-year-old daughter is a vegetarian, and she has motivated us to begin our chicken venture with the goals of healthier eating and living. Our daughters are responsible for taking care of the black Australorp hens.</p><p>The main house is constructed mostly from recycled materials, including a large wooden shipping crate and a piece of metal roofing we found on the side of the road. There are doors for gathering eggs and a door to the “run.” One whole side opens for cleaning. I think it is a very ingenious design!</p><p>The tractor and run are moved around our yard with the hope that the hens will eat the grubs, ticks, beetles, etc.</p><h5>Mara Ziegler<br />Boalsburg, Pennsylvania</h5><p></p><h3>Cheap But Comfy</h3><p></p><p>I invested 20 hours and $60 in materials to build this chicken “tractor” (see Image Gallery), which comfortably houses four hens.</p><p>This A-frame chicken coop is 4 feet wide, 6 feet long and 41⁄2 feet tall. The base is made from 2-by-6s, with 2-by-4s for the sides. The door skins, siding and nesting boxes are three-eighths-inch plywood. Four 4-inch strap hinges hang the doors, and chicken wire finishes the project. For strength, I used wood screws rather than nails to build the coop.</p><h5>David Hymel<br />Eatonville, Washington</h5>
