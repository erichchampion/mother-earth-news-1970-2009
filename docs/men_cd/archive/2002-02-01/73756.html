                        <p>      <strong>1. Personal and national security.</strong> The more we tap solar      and other renewable energy sources, the less dependent we      are on utility giants and nonrenewable fossil fuels. Solar      roofs can even be used to charge electric vehicles, which      will reduce pollution and decrease our need for foreign      oil.<br />      <br />      <strong>2. Protection against price increases.</strong>      Electricity prices in many states are increasing. In      California a combina tion of deregulation, population      growth, increased consumer demand and construction of fewer      new power plants caused electricity costs to skyrocket.      Other states are watching similar trends and expect prices      to increase in the coming years. With nuclear power plants      being decommissioned or phased out because of the high      costs and high risks related to nuclear waste disposal, and      with the best hydroelectric sources tapped, new sources of      electricity are needed. Even though many new gas-fired      power plants have been constructed, some analysts see      natural gas shortages emerging that will require expensive      drilling and pipeline construction. This points to higher      natural gas prices rippling across to electricity      prices.<br />      <br />      <strong>3. Rebates</strong> . Some states are finally      getting serious about supporting renewable energy options.      Government rebates, tax credits and grants can cut the cost      of your solar roof by up to 60 percent in some areas. To      learn what's available in your state, go to the Database of      State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE),      <em>www.DSIREUSA.org .<br /></em><br />      <strong>4. Selling back peak power to the grid via      net-metering.</strong> Net-metering rules and regulations      are in place in 34 states, allowing homeowners to run their      electrical meters backward when they send electricity to      the grid from a solar-electric rooftop. When the homeowner      uses electricity from the grid at night or on cloudy days,      the meter runs forward. The monthly bill is based on the      net difference.<br />      <br />      Distributed electrical generation provides more security      for homeowners and for the electrical network (the grid).      Generating cleaner, locally produced electricity reduces      the load on the grid and can also jump-start the formation      of local public utilities. These nonprofit utilities are      run by a locally elected board for public benefit, in      contrast to investor-owned utilities that are run for      private profit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5.</strong> <strong>Global warming      reductions.</strong> According to the Department of Energy      (DOE), electric power plants emitted 40 percent of all      carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions in the United States in      1999, making them the largest single-source contributor to      global warming. Fifty-one percent of all the electricity      produced in the United States in 1999 was generated by      coal-fired plants, yet these plants produced 80 percent of      all the C0 2 emissions resulting from electricity power      generation. DOE also reports one-quarter of all types of      air pollution emissions nationwide are caused by burning      fossil fuels (coal, natural gas and oil) to generate      electricity.<br />      <br />      <strong>6.</strong> <strong>A response to "Not in my back      yard"</strong> Conventional power plants and transmission      lines take years to plan, site and build - and most people      do not want them in their back yards. Power distribution      systems feeding metropolitan areas are operating near      capacity during peak demand periods. Onsite power      production via home solar-electric installations, part of a      "distributed generation" scenario, offers a positive      solution for elected officials seeking to prevent blackouts      and brownouts, improve air quality and enhance the economy      by producing jobs.<br />      <br />      <strong>7.</strong> <strong>A beautiful, distinctive,      high-tech, home design element.</strong> Technological      developments have resulted in more appealing and affordable      systems, designed to complement a home's architecture. With      Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV), the      solar-electric system is the roof.<br />      <br />      <strong>8.</strong> <strong>Supporting the future of solar      power.</strong> The PV market is worth $2 billion today,      and is expected to grow to $10 billion by 2010. The annual      growth rate of solar PV products has increased by 20      percent annually and is expected to double every three      years for the next 20 years. This growth should spur      additional investment, contribute to economies of scale in      the industry and help make systems even more affordable.    </p>
