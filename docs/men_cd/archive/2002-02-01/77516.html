                        <h3>New England/Maritime Canada</h3>    <p>      The days grow longer and the sun is slowly warming the      ground, sending the first sweet s cents of spring into the      air. Seed orders are arriving. It's time to sort the onions      and make French onion soup with the soft and sprouted ones.      Check your garlic, too: Soft cloves can be minced, mixed      with olive oil and frozen for future use. In northern      areas, start onions, leeks, celery and any slow-growing      herbs or flowers, such as petunias and pansies. As the days      warm, check for aphids in the greenhouse, especially on      overwintered greens, such as kale and spinach. Control with      sprays of insecticidal soap, neem or hot pepper wax before      introducing tender young seedlings like peppers. Sowings of      spinach, cilantro, lettuce and some oriental greens will      germinate and begin to grow. Got cabin fever? Plan a      community seed-and-seedling swap to share your extras.    </p>		<h3>Mid-Atlantic</h3>    <p>      Now is the time to be sure seeds are at hand and potting      soil is ready to use. Indoors, start some lettuce, early      brassicas (cabbage, broccoli and relatives), and bulb      onions from seed. Follow in mid-February with the main-crop      brassicas: peppers, eggplants, lettuce, celery, leeks and a      few early tomatoes. In the garden under row covers, make      successive plantings of spinach and radishes. Come March      add peas, beets and carrots to the successions. Plant      potatoes as soon as possible after St. Patrick's Day. As      soon as they're in, it's time to start the main crop of      tomatoes indoors. 'Eva Purple Ball' tomato is highly      recommended for disease-resistant, blemish-free fruits with      an incredible, old-fashioned flavor. Unfurl your hoses and      plan your irrigation; be certain it's all in running order      because a dry spring may be right around the corner.    </p>		<h3>Southern Interior</h3>    <p>      The first days of spring are arriving across the South, but      don't be fooled. More freezing temperatures can follow      those tempting warm days. It's important to wait until      after the last hard frost of the season (usually around the      end of March) before moving tender seedlings out to the      garden. If you must plant them earlier, be sure to use some      type of protection, such as Wall O' Water insulating tipis.      The careful planning you made in the winter months will pay      huge dividends now. It can be tempting to get carried away      and plant far more than originally planned. Choose items      that grow best in your zone and the space you have      available to maximize your enjoyment of your garden.      Early-maturing new variety choices to speed up your harvest      include `Blue Wonder' snap bean (ready in 55 days) and      'Magda' hybrid squash (45 days).    </p>		<h3>Gulf Coast</h3>    <p>      Finish planting cool-season vegetable transplants in early      February. Then sit back and catch your breath for a week or      two: This is the beginning of warm-season gardening, and      one of the busiest times of the Southern garden year. Corn      and snap beans can be planted as soon as danger of frost is      past; for a continuous harvest, plant beans every two weeks      through April. As nights get warmer, transplant tomatoes      and other warm-season veggies. Enrich the planting hole      with compost for long-term feeding and use manure tea or a      liquid fish fertilizer for an immediate boost. Black      plastic mulch will warm up the soil and allow earlier      planting of heat-loving melons, okra and peppers. Divide      perennials in February and prune evergreen shrubs. Wait to      prune flowering shrubs until after bloom is finished.      Fertilize ornamentals and trees with a compost mulch. Plant      palms, tropical fruit and citrus trees in March.    </p>    <p>      'Eva Purple Ball' is a German heirloom tomato with      incredible,<br /> old-fashioned flavor. Seeds are available from      Southern<br /> Exposure Seed Exchange, (540) 894-9480.    </p>        <h3>Central/Midwest</h3>    <p>      To banish lingering snow, sprinkle it with a thin,      heat-absorbing layer of clean firewood ash or dark mulch.      It will melt away faster and give you a jump-start on      cool-season veggie planting. Fruit trees and other woody      plants should be trimmed now while daytime temperatures      remain below freezing. In some municipalities it is illegal      to trim oak trees past March due to concern about wilt      diseases. It's time to start heat-loving veggies and      slow-growing flowers indoors, but limit your enthusiasm      according to the window and grow-light space you will have      as the plants grow. New varieties to try: 'Black Magic      Rose' geranium has unique, dark foliage edged with lime      green, and hot pink blooms all summer. 'Fish pepper' is a      pre-1870s African-American heirloom with white variegated      leaves and 2- to 3-inch-long fruits.<br />      <br />    </p>            <h3>North Central and Rockies</h3>    <p>      While snow and cold weather linger through March outside,      inside it's time to start flats of seedlings ready for      trans planting when the soil finally warms. Start tomatoes      extra-early only if you'll have time to move them into      larger containers to prevent root growth from being      stunted. Otherwise, wait until late March: A smaller tomato      plant with growth momentum is better than a large,      root-bound plant. As snow recedes in the garden, note the      earliest melting spots. These sites maximize the growing      seasons of cold mountain gardens by creating small, warm      miniclimates. Even a small angle of slope to the south can      dramatically increase soil warmth. Large rocks or concrete      walls collect the sun's heat during the day and protect      from frost at night. Tall-growing crops or permanent hedges      will protect larger gardens and fields. An old Chinese      saying: "Select a proper site for the garden and half the      work is done."    </p>    <h3>Pacific Northwest</h3>    <p>      When the rainy, gray weather is about to drive you insane,      there is nothing more satisfying than getting flower, herb      and vegetable seeds started indoors and knowing the warmth      of the sun will soon be back to the Pacific Northwest.      Early spring soils are often too wet to till, but you can      still plant some cold-season seeds outside. For peas,      simply scratch a 1-inch furrow into the soil, plant your      pea seed and cover with soil. Plant lettuce, spinach and      other greens directly into garden beds and protect from the      elements with a cloche or row cover. For a spring cover      crop to be tilled under in early summer, hand broadcast      clover or Austrian field pea seed, and lightly rake it into      the soil. Try 'Honey Gold' tomatoes this year for a      tempting summer treat. It is a flavorful teardrop bunching      tomato - nice and firm, but not overly sweet.    </p>    <h3>Southwest</h3>    <p>      Start heat-loving veggies inside and wait to plant them      outside until the nights are consistently above 50 degrees.      An easy test is to take your shoes off and walk through      your garden in the afternoon. If the soil is too cold for      you, it is too cold for your summer crops. Along with other      cold-season vegetables, try Miner's lettuce (Montia      perfoliata), a shade-tolerant Western native with tender,      funnel-shaped leaves, grown extensively in Europe as a      commercial salad plant. Spread wheat straw mulch over your      garden in February to keep weeds at bay. One bale will      cover about 400 square feet. Just move the mulch aside when      it's time to plant.    </p>    <p>      This time of year is heaven on earth for slugs and snails.      An easy solution: a chicken for every one-third acre or      less. They lay the most delicious eggs in      spring-escargot-flavored!    </p>    <p>      Our thanks to the following for their contributions to the      Almanac: <strong>Roberta Bailey, FEDCO Seeds</strong> ,      Waterville, Maine; <strong>Cricket Rakita, Southern      Exposure Seed Exchange</strong> , Mineral, Virginia;      <strong>Connie DamByl, William Dam Seeds</strong> , Dundas,      Ontario; <strong>Matt Barthel, Seed Savers      Exchange</strong> , Decorah, Iowa; <strong>Bill McDorman,      Seeds Trust/High Altitude Gardens</strong> , Hailey, Idaho;      <strong>Josh Kirschenbaum and Tom Johns, Territorial Seed      Company</strong> , Cottage Grove, Oregon; <strong>Rose      Marie Nichols McGee, Nichols Garden Nursery</strong> ,      Albany, Oregon; <strong>Craig and Sue Dremann, Redwood City      Seed Co</strong> ., Redwood City, California; <strong>Dean      Lollis, Park Seed Co.</strong> , Greenwood, South Carolina    </p>
