                            <h5 id="byline">        by DIANA WALLMANS      </h5>			    <p>      I'm sending you this picture because its so amazing. I have      a hair salon, and I've been putting the hair clipping,      around my lilies and roses for years now. The lily in this      picture is 3 years old. It has 68 buds and blossom, on it!      The average for my lilies is 12 to 24 buds and blossoms, at      most. My clients couldn't believe their eyes, and the smell      was like heaven. I take pictures of this lily every day.      Please let me know what your magazine thinks about this.    </p>    <p>      DIANA WALLMANS<br />      Sumner, Washington</p>    <p>      <em>Great!
