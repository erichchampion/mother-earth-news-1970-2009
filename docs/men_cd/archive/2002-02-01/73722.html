                    <h5 id="byline">      By Joan Gussow, Ph.D.    </h5>    <p>      <strong>Photos by Mick Hales</strong>    </p>        <p>      A young neighbor who watered and harvested my garden for a      few days last summer left a message on my answering machine      while I was away. She had read my new book, <em>This      Organic Life,</em> which tells the story of my      quarter-century effort to eat locally in downstate New      York.    </p>    <p>      "I was just thinking," she said. "This may be the only time      in history when humans have had complete strangers -      strangers who are badly treated or ignored - growing and      preparing all our food."    </p>    <p>      One could nitpick her facts, but she has the right idea.      Not even a century ago, most of us had a pretty good idea      where our food came from. Now - if the eaters I speak to      are typical - most people can't identify the origin of      anything they ate yesterday.    </p>    <p>      And, as my young friend's comment suggests, if we knew      where our food was coming from, if we knew who and what was      involved in getting it to our tables, we would doubtless be      appalled at the evils wrought on our behalf - not only to      strangers, but to the planet and its other living beings.      We might even be scared. Here are a few reasons why we      should be:    </p>    <p>      • The contamination of crops - even organic crops -      with genetically modified organisms, whose long term effect      on our ecosystem is unknown and whose effects on human      health are untested;<br />      • The horrors and cruelties of the hog factories with      their lagoons of waste;<br />      • Meat and poultry plants with their speeded-up      disassembly lines threatening not only the lives and limbs      of the people who work them, but the health of those who      eat the flesh they produce;<br />      • Our growing dependence on perishable foods shipped      to us from poor countries everywhere;<br />      • And most critically, the hemorrhaging of farmers and      farmland from our national landscape. (The latest figures      show that for every farmer under 35 there are five farmers      over 65.) All these portend a future that seems anything      but secure where our food is concerned.    </p>        <p>      In losing farmers we are losing the capacity to feed      ourselves. A couple of years ago, economist Steven Blank      wrote a book with the ominous title <em>The End of      Agriculture in the American Portfolio</em> (Greenwood      Publishing Group). Blank believes agriculture may move      overseas because investing in it is just not profitable.    </p>    <p>      I'll say. In 1999 production costs rose 20 percent, and      prices for commodities fell an average of 7 percent. On      average, farmers and ranchers now get 7 percent to 8      percent of food system profit. Who'd invest in that?    </p>    <p>      As for what that means in the field, consider the potato.      In his brilliantly devastating book <em>Fast Food      Nation</em> (Houghton Mifflin), Eric Schlosser explains      that a few companies control most of the potato market.      Fast food purveyors now buy frozen fries for about 30  cents      a pound, reheat them in oil and sell them (with added      grease) for about $6 a pound. On every $1.50 order of fries      a potato farmer makes 2  cents.    </p>    <p>      The result was reported in <em>The New York Times</em> last      summer. Under the headline "Misery is Abundant for Potato      Farmers," the story pointed out that it costs a potato      farmer about $5 to produce a 100 pound sack of potatoes,      for which the processors pay him less than $1. What's a      farmer to do? The subhead said it: "Bumper Crops Turned      into Fertilizer." Many farmers plowed their crops under.      When that happened in the Great Depression, it was all over      the papers. Now it hardly makes the news.    </p>    <p>      In the Northeast, where I live, the loss of farmers is      catastrophic: Cranberry growers have been told to cut      production because a surplus has driven prices too low.    </p>    <p>      New York State dairyman and orchardists are going out of      business every day. Two years ago, I visited an upstate      dairy where the farmer had earned more for growing one acre      of gourmet potatoes than from a year of dairying. The next      year, lots of upstate dairymen grew gourmet potatoes,      prices dropped and that little stream of hope dried up.    </p>    <p>      And it wasn't apples my landscape-architect friend went to      buy at the orchard we visited one day. He was buying mature      apple trees for an instant antique orchard, part of the      multimillion-dollar landscaping of a new McMansion. The      trees the farmer sold that afternoon netted him more than a      month of apple selling.    </p>    <p>      It isn't just New York growers who are in trouble either.      Apple producers everywhere now compete directly with      China's cheap labor. The world's most populous nation, with      little land per capita for food production, has set out to      become apple producer for the world, although growing      apples for export utilizes precious land on which China      should grow food for her people.    </p>    <p>      Faced with such an ominously changing food landscape, what      can we do?    </p>    <p>      Almost 30 years ago, I went into the field I nutrition      because I was concerned about what was happening to the      U.S. food supply as the world faced a food and population      crisis. The products appearing on our grocery shelves      seemed increasingly frivolous in a world full of hungry      people. Could we feed everyone, I wondered, without      devastating the environment? Wasn't the array of filly      cereals and juice drinks a shameful distraction from the      real issues? My search for answers to those questions led      me to the - conclusion that our food supply was wasteful      and unsustainable, and the methods we were exporting to      increase food production around the world were likely to      end up making things worse.    </p>        <p>      So 23 years ago, I published a book, <em>The Feeding      Web,</em> about our role in the global food system. Its      message was that we in this rich country can pull food from      wherever on the planet it's produced, so it looks as if we      can always have everything. The trouble is that      "everything" often is being produced and brought to us at a      true cost that is hor rendous: wasted and irreplaceable      groundwater and fossil energy, eroded top soils, polluted      soil, water and air, and so on.    </p>    <p>      What could be done? Obviously the problems I had identified      were invisible to U.S. eaters, most of whom had no idea      how, where or by whom their food was grown. As a teacher, I      knew how hard it would be to make food production relevant      to eaters who had long ago learned from the abundance of      the supermarkets and the blandishments of advertisers that      they could expect to eat anything any time.    </p>    <p>      How, I wondered, could U.S. shoppers be made to understand      the need to protect the people and places that grew their      food? How could they be taught to care about farmers in      California, let alone in Ethiopia or Guatemala? I concluded      people had to be helped to unlearn the anything, anywhere,      anytime lessons about food by being taught to eat from      closer to home. Unless the demand end of the food supply      could be changed, we rich consumers would continue to pull      in foods from everywhere, no matter how hungry the rest of      the world became, and no matter how much damage our demand      was doing to our mutual biosphere.    </p>    <p>      Relocalizing the food system in this way seemed almost      impossible to achieve, but worth trying, given the scary      alternatives. In the early 1980s, I began to suggest to my      colleagues in nutrition that we needed to change the      content, not just the methods, of nutrition education and      move people toward more local, seasonal diets. This radical      idea that we should move away from the overflowing global      supermarket, this marvel of modernity - was judged both      impractical and silly given the convenience and abundance      of the supermarket.    </p>    <p>      I disagreed with the silly part, but as for impractical, I      wasn't sure. I had begun to talk about local eating with no      clear idea of what a New York diet would taste like when      the ground was frozen. I decided I had to walk my talk and      move toward local, seasonal eating. Because farmer's      markets were few and far between, my husband and I set out      to do it in the only way it could then be done, by      producing it ourselves.    </p>    <p>      I think I said we intended to "grow our own food," a      formulation that seems remarkably naive in retrospect,      since we only grew fruits and vegetables. But since the      things people worry about most when you talk about eating      locally are fruits and vegetables ("What would I do for      salad in January?") the effort seemed worthwhile.    </p>    <p>      My goal was not to prove that everyone could grow her own      if she wanted to. My goal was to create a model of what      local farmers could make available if we set out to create      a market for what they could produce. I was trying to model      - and I still am - the sort of eating choices I thought we      all needed to work toward if we were to have a sustainable      food system and world. I wanted to demonstrate that      responsible eating could be done without real pain. And 25      years after I decided to live by my convictions, I know      that it can be. I demonstrate the tastiness of local eating      every time I serve a splendid local meal in the dead of      winter.    </p>    <p>      Having made my point, I obviously would help farmers more      by buying their food than by growing my own, assuming I      could find a local year-round source. But now I'm totally      addicted to growing the vegetables I eat and eating only      the vegetables I grow. To assure myself that this obsession      is rational, I use my own farming crises to teach me      lessons about what farmers go through to feed us all. So I      want to conclude this manifesto with a couple of stories      from my book to illustrate two of the lessons I've learned      in 30-odd years. The first of those lessons is that if we      eat locally, weather will matter a lot more.    </p>    <p>      Two summers ago, we had a drought in my region, and it got      so dry that rats chomped into every one of my tomatoes as      they ripened. I live on the Hudson, a tidal river with a      wedge of salt flowing upriver under the surface. When      there's no rain going into the river to dilute it, it gets      increasingly salty. Well into my rat crisis I learned from      the mayor, a former fisherman, that the rats couldn't      handle the salt. They were eating my tomatoes for liquid.      So I called Roger, the village's exterminator, who is paid      to keep the riverfront free of rats. He scouts the      community garden out of generosity, and, since I'm right      next door, fits me in, too. In the midst of my despair, I      shared his diagnosis and my own frustration by e-mail with      the community gardeners:    </p>        <p>      <strong>By restricting myself to eating vegetables I grow,      I'm constantly reminded that food is the generous outcome      of a collaboration between our species and the rest of      nature, not simply another product of industrial      civilization.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Fellow Gardeners: Just thought you'd like to know that      I haven't harvested a ripe tomato yet. The rats have gotten      them all. Roger came, announced that there were no rat      burrows on either my property or in the community garden,      so he couldn't put poison down the den. He said he would      put out bait stations, but then he said, "Joan, vegetables      and fruits are rats' favorite food. They're going to stand      here. " He looked back and forth between the bait station      and the tomatoes. "And they're going to say `Chicken or      sirloin? Chicken or sirloin?'and they're going to choose      sirloin."</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So if you find chomped tomatoes, don't, DON'T throw      them on the ground, but remove them to the compost pails.      Pick up and compost all dropped tomatoes. Surround your      plants with netting</em> if <em>you can. Stake them high;      get a little rat doll and stick pins in it, and hope that      Roger's bait is more attractive than he thinks!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And if you ever wonder why rats</em> <em>will outlast      us on the planet, just re</em> <em>member they don't      contribute to global</em> <em>warming by driving to the      store in a</em> <em>humvee, and they love fruits and      vegetables.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Cheers, Joan</em>    </p>        <p>      Some of this was probably hysterically bad advice, since if      the tomatoes were left ly ing around the rats might have      finished off the ones they had already started instead of      chomping into fresh ones every night.    </p>    <p>      The rat crisis ended with a flood. Six and a half inches of      rain in a few hours put my entire yard underwater. This      killed off the tomato plants and a number of other      weather-sensitive crops. Although the sweet potatoes - a      mainstay of my winter diet - looked fine, I learned when I      dug them later in the year that the water had cracked them      open and a third of the crop had rotted, leaving the others      looking like true Frankenfoods.    </p>    <p>      This was not the first time I had lost a crop to the      weather. Two years earlier we had the wettest year in      history, and I lost two-thirds of the onion crop (100      pounds the year before) and at least a third of the      potatoes. I found myself deeply depressed about the loss of      the crops. What was bothering me? I could buy potatoes and      onions when I needed them. Then it dawned on me: I was      suffering sympathetic angst.    </p>    <p>      It really didn't matter if my crops failed. I have a market      within walking distance and can afford even their high      prices. But the same could not be said for my fellow      farmers, the ones who feed you and provide for me when my      own crops fail. They have no divine dispensation that      protects their crops from the devastation mine experienced.      If I was having trouble salvaging drowned onions that year,      the Upstate onion growers surely would be sharing my      problem - and they were. That year's crop was a disaster.      As for the potato farmers, a close cousin of the potato      blight organism that set off the 19th-century Irish famine      had turned up in the Northeast a year or two earlier; the      wet weather that damaged my potatoes encouraged the blight      to spread.    </p>    <p>      Of course, no sensible farmer would have chosen my      flood-prone land, and they're certainly better at what we      both do. But they're also vulnerable to the weather. When I      bought peaches at our local farmer's market in September, I      mentioned to the grower that all my tomatoes had simply      collapsed. He said, "Mine, too." In the narcissism of      relief I said, "I'm so glad." I caught myself, apologized      and said, "I thought it was me." He smiled for the first      time since we began dealing with each other weeks earlier      and said, "No. When fullgrown plants are suddenly hit with      stress, they just collapse." I realized with relief that it      wasn't my soil, my skills or wilt from the manure I brought      in. It was the weather.    </p>    <p>      By restricting myself to eating the vegetables I grow, I'm      constantly reminded that food is the generous outcome of a      collaboration between our species and the rest of nature,      not simply another product of industrial civilization. The      lesson I learned from the realization that crops sometimes      fail wasn't that regions can't be relatively self-reliant.      They can be. It's just that if we eat locally, we sometimes      have to adjust our choices and our appetites to what Nature      decides to provide that year.    </p>    <p>      This leads directly to the second major lesson I've      learned: We'll need to change our eating patterns - a lot -      if we want to live by the seasons. Because I restrict      myself to what I grow, I recognize that I narrow my winter      choices more than most people would need to, but some hard      truths would affect everyone. Fresh tomatoes are only      available in my home July through December - when the last      ones have ripened from green in my cold cellar.    </p>    <p>      Asparagus comes for one month in the spring almost anywhere      north of the equator. And in winter I never have a lettuce      salad unless I've been far-sighted enough to plant in the      cold frame. It's encouraging to know that inventive farmers      like Eliot Coleman are teaching other farmers to grow      lovely winter greens in unheated greenhouses in chilly      places like Maine, which means local limitations may be      eased by inventiveness. But in some parts of the country,      we're going to have to adjust to several months of more      root vegetables than most of us are used to.    </p>    <p>      Seasonality, alas, is not what people know or have been      taught. In this taste-blind country, we've been taught to      think that a meal is a meal is a meal whether it's June or      December. One example of this is the widespread conviction      that the salad of iceberg lettuce and tomato is an      essential food group year-round; another is the notion,      encouraged by the California produce marketers, that      five-a-day, even in December, means a banana, orange, bunch      of grapes and a lettuce-and-tomato salad, rather than, for      example, an Indian stew containing five winter vegetables      in a single dish.    </p>    <p>      Some groups of consumers who support farmers directly      through Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) are learning      lessons we all need to learn about weather and changing      seasonal menus. Faced with unfamiliar early spring and late      fall vegetables, people learn to change their diets with      the seasons. But everyone can't join a CSA, and there are      lots of people who need educating - food writers, among      others, who all too often feature recipes that have nothing      to do with what's seasonally available.    </p>    <p>      I am moved and encouraged by the thousands of efforts      around the country to connect schools and farms, chefs and      farms, and consumers and farms. I chair the board of a      group in New York City, called Just Food, which has helped      start 19 CSAs. Using the new census figures and estimates      of the number of people our CSAs feed, I calculated our CSA      farmers are feeding one out of every 2,000 New Yorkers.      That's a fabulous beginning. But small.    </p>        <p>      The overwhelming majority of people still choose their      foods mindlessly from the global supermarket the rest of      the world provides for us, choosing for price, taste and      variety (with an emphasis on variety and price, good taste      being represented by what they're used to), heavily dosed      with sugar and salt.    </p>    <p>      It won't be enough to convince those people to shop at      farmers' markets in the summer, helpful as those are. We      need people to shop mindfully year-round, seeking out      seasonal local produce even in the winter.    </p>    <p>      There's much work to do. Those of us working toward      relocalization need to talk seriously about just what we      mean by local. How local? Grains and beans might reasonably      be shipped, for reasons I explain in my book. And I see no      reason why people who live in colder climates can't      sometimes have oranges, though a daily glass of fresh      orange juice north of here oranges grow is prob ably      self-indulgent. Spices which are light and of high value      should be shared around the world. But, overall, produce is      about 90 percent water: <strong>We are warming the planet      shipping cold water around the world It costs 435 fossil      fuel calories to fly a 5 calorie strawberry from California      to New York.</strong> Yet a strawberry researcher from      Ithaca told me that we could have a much longer run of      local strawberries in the East if there were rewards for      raising them, and they would be grown here if California      produce didn't arrive so cheaply in our markets. Many food      trade patterns are irrational.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Herman Daly noted we in the United States both      import end export Danish butter cookies. He suggested we      might better exchange recipes.</strong>    </p>    <p>      My food-system radicalization occurred when I found Haiti,      the poorest country in the hemisphere, exports meat to us.      Another insanity is that we export what we import. My      favorite economist, Herman Daly, noted we in the United      States both import and export Danish butter cookies. He      suggested we might better exchange recipes.    </p>    <p>      Once, after I spoke about the problems of global      agriculture, someone came up and said, "Do you really      imagine there will be a time when our cities will be      surrounded by farms producing much of their food?" I don't      know. I can't imagine how we're going to get to such a      place from where we are now, but I know what's out there      now isn't going to last. The planet is already showing      signs of a terminal illness. The simple fact is a global      food system isn't sustainable; we might, just might, be      able to make local ones that are. As someone concerned with      food, I can't imagine any other way to live.    </p>    <p>      At the beginning of the 21st century, I'm no longer alone      in my concern about the future of the food system; the idea      that we might chose diets more responsible to the places      where we live is no longer viewed as silly and impractical.      Around the country are thousands of organized efforts to      move the nation toward more seasonal local eating. What all      are trying to teach to everyone from preschoolers to      homemakers, from chefs to retirees, are these lessons: Get      to know your farmer, because someone out there is growing      <em>you</em> . Wherever you are, eat what your own      landscape can provide.    </p>        <p>      I have lately learned to admire the novelist Arundhati Roy,      who is using the fame she earned from her writing to wage a      public campaign against nuclear arms and large dams in her      native India. This is what she said: "When you go to Europe      or America for the first time, you arrive in a city where      you don't see any mud, and everything looks really nice,      all the cars and the steel and the glass. But I look at a      car and I think, `This came from earth and water and      forest.' How? I don't know. But you need to know - you need      to know what the connection is; who paid the price of      what."    </p>    <p>      That's what I would say about the foods we eat. We need to      remember that somehow they came "from earth and water and      forest." We need to know how, and who paid the price. We      need to know what the connections are, and then we need to      use our power as eaters to demand delicious food produced      by local food systems that are economically sound,      ecologically sustainable and socially just.    </p>    <p>      A leading advocate for sustainable diets based on seasonal,      local produce, Gussow is a long-time organic gardener and      former chair of the Nutrition Education Program at Columbia      University.
