            		        <p>      <br />      Nothing says country quite like that pattern of blotchy      black spots on a white background. The familiar pattern of      Holstein cows is even used by Gateway Computers' boxes to      help emphasize the company's Midwestern roots. But lurking      in that apparently benign pattern is a hidden agenda:      Holsteins have been taking over the United States.    </p>    <p>      According to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures, 93      percent of all American dairy cows (more than 8 million      head) are Holstein. The breed's dominance comes basically      from being bred into freaks of nature, says Drew Conroy, an      associate professor of applied animal science at the      University of New Hampshire. A cow needs about 3,000 pounds      of milk to successfully raise a calf. A Holstein holds the      world record for milk production: 60,380 pounds of milk in      one year, <strong>20 times the natural amount.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The megamilk production has negative effects on the      Holsteins and other breeds of cows. The Holsteins generally      wear out after 2.5 lactations (around four years), much      sooner than other breeds. Holsteins also already have the      narrowest genetic pool of any cattle breed, and as      inbreeding for maximum milk production continues, the      danger of genetic maladies in the breed increases. Other      dairy breeds' population numbers are now so small, breeders      worry that there aren't enough left to keep a viable      genetic pool.    </p>    <p>      Conroy says the solution lies not in trying to force large      dairy operations to diversify, but getting more people to      participate in food production and raise other breeds      beside the Holstein. "In my classes, I ask, "How many of      you like industrial farming?" And no hands go up. Then I      ask, 'How many of you produce any of your own food?'And no      hands go up."<br />    </p>
