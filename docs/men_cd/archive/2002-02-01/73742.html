                		        <h5 id="byline">      By Terry Krautwurst    </h5>            <p>      I am reminded uncomfortably of a mime's feigned,      flat-handed struggle within an imaginary box. "I know how,      you feel" I think and stare out the window: past the wasp,      past the withered grass and leafless trees, at all the      barren landscape beyond. Not even the chickadees chattering      and hopscotching in the shrubs at our yard's edge can break      my mood.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Those leafless trees are not leafless at all. On every      living branch And twig of every shrub and tree, tucked      within myriad buds blanketed by bud scales from frigid      weather, are countless tiny, fully formed baby leaves.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The wasp loses its grip on the transparent barrier, falls      to the sill and then resumes its futile upward climb. On a      warmer day I'd rescue it. I'd lift the sash, put a      wide-mouth mason jar over the insect, slip a piece of thin      cardboard between the jar and the window and carry the      trapped wasp outdoors to freedom. All summer I keep      cardboard and a jar at hand for that purpose. When it comes      to wasps, which tend to be hard-bodied and irritable, catch      and release is safer than swatting.    </p>        <p>      But no, releasing this wasp out into the cold would doom it      for sure, and I'm feeling too much cabin-fever kinship with      her. I say "her" because, of course, this is a female.      She's a paper wasp specifically a member of the genus      Polistes, the sort that builds small, open-celled.      umbrella-like nests beneath eaves and picnic-shelter roofs.      Hornets and yellow jackets are paper wasps, too, but they      build enclosed nests. They also are nastier-tempered than      Polistes and create much larger colonies, sometimes      numbering in the tens of thousands by early fall. Polistes      colonies seldom exceed al couple hundred residents and more      of ten consist of only a few dozen.    </p>    <p>      All wasps (and many other members of hymenoptera, which      includes ants and bees) go through a similar annual life      cycle. In summer the colony is made up entirely of females:      nonproductive workers and a single egg-laying queen. At      summer's end, after the colony population reaches its peak.      a change takes place: Some of the nest's larval cells      produce males, and some produce fertile females. Those      chosen few leave the nest and mate. The mates, along with      the wasps left behind, ultimately die. The females, now      carrying sperm within their bodies but delaying ovulation,      each find a sheltered place in which to sleep away the      winter. They slumber beneath leaves or a log or loose bark,      between boards in an attic or within a gap in a leaky old      double-hung window.    </p>        <p>      I regard the stumbling wasp again: po tential royalty. If      she survives this joke played on her by fleeting      unseasonable warmth and a homeowner too lazy to seal a      window, if she returns to her berth and emerges later into      nature's true spring, she will make her own nest of      chewed-wood pulp, lay an egg in each cell, add the sperm      she holds and ascend to queenship. No wonder she tries so      determinedly to cross the invisible glass barrier. There's      work to be done - babies to be made. This is an expectant      mother.    </p>    <p>      Expectant. Thinking this while peering out the window, I'm      chagrined to realize I, too, have been fooled to      frustration by the unseen, invisible, seemingly Not There.      I look again at the landscape through eyes opened with the      help of my wasp companion, and suddenly it is not so      barren.    </p>    <p>      All around is spring itself, fresh and green and abuzz with      life merely out of sight. Those "leafless" trees are not      leafless at all. On every living branch and twig of every      shrub and tree, tucked within myriad buds blanketed by bud      scales from frigid weather, are countless tiny, fully      formed baby leaves. They've been there since late last      summer - all of them, spring's entire green gush of      foliage, waiting in miniature: the dogwoods' saw-toothed      ovals, the spiky red oaks and the many-thumbed whites, the      arrow-shaped birches and elms, the feathery walnuts and      ashes, every leaf of every deciduous species.    </p>    <p>      Spring's signature flowers, too, ornament the unseen      landscape, disguised from above by the withered remains of      last year's stems and leaves. Over at the moist edge of our      woods, there's snowybloomed bloodroot; on the opposite      side, white-winged Dutchman's breeches. Farther back,      there's furtive jack-in-the-pulpit and mayapple, and along      our driveway, wild columbine's whiskered pendants. They're      all there, complete with stems, leaves and flowering parts:      spring's generation snug underground in buds nourished by      the food-storage bins we call bulbs, corms, rhizomes and      tubers.    </p>        <p>      <strong>That night, hours later, I notice the wasp is gone. Good.      At lest there's a chance she found way back to her bunk</strong>    </p>    <p>      The wasp clambers to eye level and reminds me again of its      hymenopteran kin - and the host of other warm-weather      insects covertly populating the winter world. In addition      to countless queens-to-be and other insects wintering under      shelter as adults, there are the eggs, larvae and pupae of      hundreds of species, all with spring due dates. Moths such      as the luna and polyphemus spend the winter months as pupae      in leaf-wrapped cocoons; others forego the cocoon and      burrow their mummy-like pupal selves underground.      Not-quite-adult butterflies - future flying flowers - form      a hard-shelled chrysalis around their nondescript bodies      and hang out under, or on, frost-killed vegetation. Tiny      beetle eggs spend the season buried in loose leaves and      soil; in warmer weather, they'll emerge as glowworm larvae      and then fireflies.    </p>    <p>      Then, too, are the hidden warm-blooded creatures: the mice      and voles beneath the tall matted grass along the road; the      hibernators, such as woodchucks and turtles, slumbering in      burrows near the pond down the hill, their metabolisms on      slow, pilot-light burn.    </p>    <p>      I'm standing at the window considering all this and noting      how the chickadees outside seem more cheering than a while      ago, when I remember I need to put more wood on the fire. I      glance briefly at the wasp in the window, then leave to      take care of that chore and others, too. That night, hours      later, I notice the wasp is gone. Good. At least there's a      chance she found a way back to her bunk.    </p>    <p>      I crawl into my own bed and pull up the covers. The      weatherman is calling for a return to frigid temperatures,      maybe freezing rain or snow. No problem, I think, just      before dropping off to sleep. No problem at all.    </p>
