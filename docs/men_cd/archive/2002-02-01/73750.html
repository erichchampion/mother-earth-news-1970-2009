                    <h5 id="byline">      By Jeff Cox    </h5>        <p>      My dad figured out the perfect low-work, time-saving way to      deal with mowing the grass: He made me do it. Since then      I've had a love-hate relationship with my lawns. I don't      enjoy mowing them any more now than I did when I was 13,      but as soon as the grass gets the least bit shaggy, I feel      the need to cut it.    </p>    <p>      The longer I put it off, the guiltier I feel, the more it      calls and the more difficult the job becomes.    </p>    <p>      I could take a cue from my dad and hire a teenager, but I      remember how I used to run the mower over rocks - gouging      chunks of metal out of the cutting blade and sometimes      bending the driveshaft - without thinking twice about it.    </p>    <p>      There's always the farmyard approach, fencing in the lawn      and running horses, cows or sheep in there. But fencing is      expensive, there are vet bills, shelter for winter, flies      in the manure ...    </p>    <p>      Or I could plant zoysia grass. This stuff stays short but      has the texture of a stiff-bristled scrub brush and is only      green between the last and first frosts. Forget that. Some      MOTHER readers are trying to lose their lawns and plant      permaculture gardens, but for many of us, at least some      lawn is a fact of life.    </p>    <p>      Besides, I remind myself, think of the advantages of real      lawn grass. Even without fertilizers, weed killers and      heavy irrigation, a neatly mown, low-care lawn gives your      property an inviting, park-like look. And if you want to      catch the clippings, they are magnificent additions to the      compost pile, providing as much nitrogen as cow manure.      Laid down thickly in the garden, clippings make weedproof      paths. They also make fine, nutritious mulch for all kinds      of vegetables. Farther out, you may have a meadow or an      orchard that requires mowing only once or twice a year to      keep down volunteer saplings, noxious weeds - such as giant      ragweed, poison ivy or poison oak - and thorny customers      like multiflora roses and greenbriar.    </p>    <p>      The beauty of a lawn or meadow, as well as the benefit of      usable outdoor space, makes mowing worth the work. As with      any chore, however, the right tool makes the job go easier.      Let's look at the tools available and consider their      merits, starting with the nonpolluting, human-powered      options.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Reel Mowers: $100 to $225</strong>    </p>        <p>      Hand-pushed reel mowers offer multiple advantages over      gas-powered mowers: no noise, no noxious air pollution, no      danger of flying rocks, low maintenance and no worries      about getting them started. Plus you get a great aerobic      workout every time you use them, burning about 300 calories      an hour.    </p>    <p>      The secret to easy cutting with these mowers is frequent      mowing. If you let the grass get too long, the reel mower      blades will tend to bind up or take an inordinate amount of      pushing to get the mower through long grass. Cut when the      grass is no more than an inch longer than you want it. A      quarter acre (100 feet by 160 feet) of lawn can be cut in      about an hour with a reel mower. For areas larger than      that, you may want to go to a walk-behind, gas-powered      cutter, either push or self-propelled.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Electric Mowers: $400 to $670</strong>    </p>    <p>      You can buy corded electric mowers that run directly off of      your home's electricity, but keeping the cord out of the      way as you mow is a challenge on all but the smallest      lawns. On the other hand, cordless electric mowers offer      the same advantages of reel mowers: less noise, pollution      and maintenance than gas-powered machines, easy starting,      plus a good workout. They are an especially green choice if      you live where electricity comes from hydroelectric dams -      rather than coal or nuclear power plants - or if you enjoy      free electricity from your own home solar-electric system      or wind generator.    </p>        <p>      Cordless electric mowers include batteries that have to be      plugged into an outlet after each use to recharge. They      generally are not self-propelled and tend to be heavy      because of their batteries. If a small person will be using      the mower, test drive it at the dealers.    </p>    <p>      Even greener than a cordless electric mower is the new      Sunwhisper solar-charged mower. The Sunwhisper features two      Siemens photovoltaic (PV) solar panels that charge a Black      & Decker 24-volt, CMMI000 cordless electric mower. You      can either mount the PV panels on your garage or shed roof,      or mount them right on the handles of the mower. As long as      the panels are facing south in full sun, they will keep the      mower's battery charged for about two hours of mowing per      week. If you need an overnight or cloudy-day charge, you      still have the option to recharge by plugging into a home      outlet.    </p>    <p>      The Sunwhisper solar-charged mower sells for $670 plus      shipping from FreePowerSystems ( www.freepowersys.com ;      (303) 651-3184). The Black & Decker 24-volt mower lists      at $329.99.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Push-Type, Gas-Powered<br /></strong> <strong>Lawn      Mowers: $150 to $350</strong>    </p>    <p>      You might ask why you'd want an engine-powered mower you      have to push rather than one that's self-propelled. There      are three reasons. First, the push mowers cost less.      Second, while self-propelled mowers are fine on large lawns      without many obstacles, the mower you push can be more      easily guided through tight spaces, around trees and      shrubs, and around island beds. Plus its forward or      backward speed is your walking speed. Third, all but the      most serious full-time homesteaders will benefit from a      weekly aerobic workout behind a push mower.    </p>    <p>      Most mowers of this type have four- to six-horsepower      engines. Avoid any that are underpowered, as they can stall      in high grass and won't make as clean a swath. Look for      engines with clean-burning, overhead valves, rather than      side-valve engines. Make sure the mowing platform can be      adjusted up to 4 inches off the ground. Weeds are      suppressed and lawns are healthier when the grass is      longer. Short-cropped grass exposes roots, and low mowers      can hit rocks or scalp the soil over rough spots.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Self-Propelled, Gas-Powered</strong><br />      <strong>Lawn Mowers: $200 to $800</strong>    </p>    <p>      Self-propelled, gas-engine mowers reduce some of the      physical work of mowing but cost somewhat more than push      versions. If you decide to buy a self-propelled model, be      aware of several factors that can affect their performance.    </p>    <p>      First, if you are planning to leave your clippings on the      lawn, look for a mulching deck. This is simply a series of      baffles and blades fixed to the underside of the housing      that covers the rotating blade. When grass is cut, the      baffles recirculate the grass clippings until they are      reduced to fine mulch, which disappears quickly.    </p>    <p>      Many self-propelled mowers have safety features, such as a      blade-brake-clutch. For the blade to operate, you have to      hold a lever down as part of the handle. When you pause the      unit or release the clutch lever, the blade stops      automatically.    </p>    <p>      Some mowers offer a drive system that adjusts to your      walking pace.    </p>    <h3>      Electric Mower      Enthusiasm    </h3>        <p>      Denise Rubens of Rocky Ridge, Maryland, takes the issue of      Earth-friendly mowing seriously - so seriously she uses two      cordless battery-powered electric mowers to manage the      needs of her 2-acre yard. Her large mowing area has steep      hills with thicker grass in the spring, and this terrain      pushes the limits of these mowers. However, she was      determined to do the job without storing gasoline or      creating harmful emissions.    </p>    <p>      Her first mower was the Black & Decker Cordless      Mulching Mower, Model CMM625. Purchased four years ago,      this mower offers a 3.5 horsepower engine, an 18-inch      blade, and 12-volt lead/acid battery, which charges fully      in 24 hours. On a single charge, the mower can cut up to      10,000 square feet, depending on the condition of the      grass. However, Rubens had to stretch her mowing over      several days in order to allow for recharging time. Despite      this inconvenience, she continued to mow in this manner      until she could upgrade. "When the mower gets tired, so do      I," she says. (Cordless electric mowers generally are not      self-propelled. )    </p>    <p>      Desiring more power, Rubens purchased Black & Decker's      Model CMM1000 earlier this year. This upgraded model      features across-the-board improvements. It offers a      five-horsepower engine, a 19-inch cutting blade and a      24-volt battery, which can recharge in just 16 hours. The      CMM1000 cuts a larger area on a single charge, about 19,000      square feet. This mower is bigger and heavier than the      CMM625, but what it loses in maneuverability it makes up      for in a shorter recharge time and slightly larger cutting      swath.    </p>    <p>      "For areas where there is thick, wet crabgrass, the CMM1000      does the job," says Rubens. "On the other hand, the CMM625      is better on slopes because it's lighter and easier to      manage. Both mowers have their strengths and weaknesses,      and since I have both, I use them. My area is larger than      average, but the CMM1000 can easily handle a modest-sized      yard alone."    </p>    <p>      <em>- Amy Krouse</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Riding Mowers: $800 to $3,200</strong>    </p>    <p>      Big lawns require significant mowing time. Riding mowers      have the great advantage of giving you a place to sit down      while you spend that time. They are lighter and smaller      than heavy-duty lawn and garden tractors, without the      latter's features, such as power take-offs for snowblowing      and tillage, and blades for grading. In effect, they are      lawn mowers with seats.    </p>        <p>      Features to look for include a short turning radius, which      can run from zero up to 26 inches. A turning radius is      measured by steering the mower into the tightest circle it      can make. The radius of that circle is the turning radius.      A zero turning radius means you can stop the mower, turn      the wheels and zip off in any new direction you choose. A      short turning radius is handy for lawns with lots of      obstacles, trees and flowerbeds.<br />      <br />      Many riding mowers come with mulching decks, a good idea if      you want to recycle your clippings back onto the lawn. The      mulching deck will chop the clippings finely, so they      disappear into the lawn. Make sure the riding mower has a      powerful engine of at least eight horsepower, so it can lug      you around the yard as well as cut the grass.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Brush Cutters: $750 to $1,600</strong>    </p>        <p>      For rough work - such as giving a meadow, orchard or wet      spot a once-a-year mowing - there are plenty of      brawny-bladed trimmers, high wheel mowers and brush cutters      on the market.    </p>    <p>      Bladed trimmers are handhelds similar to string trimmers,      but are sturdier. They usually have two handlebars, gas rn      with one or two horsepower and metal blades that hack      through brushy stems.    </p>    <p>      High wheel mowers and brush cutters come with plastic      string or blades. String trimmers work well on light, juicy      weeds and grass, but for getting through small shrubs and      saplings, you'll probably want a bladed mower.    </p>    <p>      <strong>One Motor, Many Options<br />      Starting from $1,100 to $1,600</strong>    </p>        <p>      Many homesteads need more power equipment than just a      mower. Rather than buy a mower, tiller and snowblower, all      with their own motors, gears and wheels, you might want to      consider a machine that can run several attachments from      the same engine. For example, the Italian BCS tiller is a      quality machine offered by mail from Peaceful Valley Farm      Supply ( www.groworganic.com ; (888) 784-1722). You can      remove the tiller and attach a mower, brush cutter or      snowblower to this machine. The DR Field and Brush Mower      offers similar flexibility and efficiency. You can buy the      brush mower, then add a lawn mower or snow thrower. The BCS      tillers start at $1,100 and the DR starts at $1,600. If you      have a need for multiple power equipment functions, why not      talk to some of your neighbors and see if you can form a      co-op to purchase and share this kind of machinery?    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Brand Reliability      </h3>      <p>        According to <em>Consumer Reports</em> magazine, John        Deere mowers have the best record when it comes to        reliability.
