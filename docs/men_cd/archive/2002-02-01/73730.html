            		                    <p>      Here are pointers from Dennis Brown, consulting arborist      with Urban Forestry Resources in Austin, Texas, on how to      protect trees during the upcoming construction      season:<br />    </p>    <p>      • Make a plan to minimize construction activities near trees.      Trees don't heal like people do. Injuries might grow over,      but they will never really go away. It might be too late,      once you start to notice a tree is being affected. and most      won't show signs until five to seven years down the road.      <br />• If you have to do some digging in a tree's root zone, try      to consolidate the work. Plan a route that can be used for      as many purposes as possible such as utilities, foundations      and trenches. Also try to <strong>minimize any changes in      the land's drainage</strong> . Too much or too little water      in the soil can kill a tree.<br />• <strong> Don't use any more      than 4 inches of fill soil over a tree's root zone</strong>      . Adding extra soil interferes with a tree s ability to      exchange gases in its feeder roots. Carbon dioxide will      build up, literally suffocating the tree to death.      <br />• Suffocation can also happen if the soil in the tree's root      zone is compacted by heavy machinery. <strong>Just three or      four trips over the root zone by a bulldozer can cause      lasting damage to a tree</strong> . If heavy equipment must      be driven over the root zone, mitigate damage by putting      down a wood chip mulch in the area. The mulch will absorb      much of the pressure without compacting the soil.<br />• Trees are      bigger than you think. Brown says a good rule of thumb for      estimating the spread of a tree's root system (vital for      tree health) is to figure the root system stem extends out      from the trunk three times the height of the tree.<br />• Don't      compensate for stressing the tree by adding fertilizer.      Trees seldom benefit from fertilizers even when they are      not stressed.    </p>    <p>      The best way to ensure your trees' health during      construction is to employ a consulting arborist from the      start, according to Brown.    </p>
