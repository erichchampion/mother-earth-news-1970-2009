        As global warming intensifies, more energy will drive the weather, creating significantly stronger storms. A storm that hit the European continent during the winter of 1999 left $7.5 billion damage in France, Germany and Switzerland. Thousands of centuries-old trees, like these in Paris, were destroyed. It was France's worst storm since record keeping began.
