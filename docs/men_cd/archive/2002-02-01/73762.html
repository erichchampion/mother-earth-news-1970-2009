                    <h5 id="byline">      Story and photos by Janet Ott    </h5>            <p>      I work for the Garfield Farm Museum in LaFox, Illinois, a      former prairie farmstead being restored as an 1840s working      farm museum (see " Preserving History "). In the 1980s,      Garfield Farm started keeping a small flock of Black Java      chickens. Javas are one of the oldest, rarest and most      useful chickens in North America. Java popularity in the      United States peaked between 1850 and 1890. They were      especially popular as a market bird in New York and New      Jersey because their black pinfeathers quickly let      consumers know whether a bird had been properly plucked. As      chicken production became more centralized and      industrialized, black feathers were seen as a disadvantage      by producers. They preferred white specialty birds that hid      bad plucking instead of pointing it out.    </p>    <p>      Even without industry support, Javas continue to be ideal      small farm birds. They are dual-purpose birds that lay eggs      well and produce good roasters reasonably fast. They are      excellent foragers and do well for themselves in the barn      yard. Hens lay large, rich, brown eggs, and most are good      mothers to their chicks. Young cockerels make excellent      table fare with juicy, flavorful meat. Roosters average      about 9 1/2 pounds, while hens tend to be about 6 1/2      pounds. Their modest size and peaceful temperament make      Javas easy to work with.    </p>        <p>      At Garfield Farm, we're trying to reintroduce these birds      to landowners. Even if they have no experience with      livestock, or don't have enough land for a herd of sheep or      cattle, they can still help preserve this rare breed. So      many heritage livestock breeds are rapidly disappearing,      and some are already lost. Even though Javas were once      found throughout the eastern United States, their numbers      have dipped so low some wondered whether it would be      possible to save the breed from extinction.    </p>    <p>      When we at Garfield Farm heard about the low numbers of      Black Javas left, we switched our small flock from pure      display to a concentrated effort to restore a viable Java      population. The first step was to prove our Javas were      pure. University of Iowa researchers compared our birds'      genes to those of modern breeds descended from Javas and      birds from the last commercial supplier, Duane Urch.      Urch/Turnland Poultry in Owatonna, Minnesota, also supplied      Garfield Farm's original flock. We had great hope for our      flock, since the Urch flock had been closed since the late      1950s and was possibly free from crossbreeding.    </p>    <p>      The tests came back with a strong possibility that our      flock is purebred and genetically different from other      breeds, such as the Black Jersey Giant, a Java hybrid. We      also found out that we had several distinct lineages      present. All this was great news. It meant we had a better      chance of expanding our small flock into a viable breeding      community capable of re-establishing the Black Java      population.    </p>    <p>      Then we received even more good news. The Museum of Science      and Industry in Chicago offered to incubate and hatch eggs      in their facilities, allowing us to increase our numbers      faster. With the increased number of chicks, we have been      able to increase our own flock and have chicks available      for individuals who want to start their own flocks.    </p>    <p>      We were thrilled our repopulation efforts were working so      well. Then in 1999, we were shocked and thrilled when four      of our chicks came out white. Although never officially      recognized as a breed, White Javas are a known variation of      the Blacks. The last White Java chicken was seen in the      1950s, but the genes for the variety lay hidden in our      flock of Blacks. We jumped on the opportunity to      reintroduce another variety. We now have 75 White Javas and      will be able to sell a few this year to establish new      flocks. Some of our Whites have a blue-gray color on their      first feathers. We're hopeful that we can use these chicks      to revive the Blue Java variety. So far, none of the chicks      have kept their blue tendencies into adulthood, but given      our string of luck, we hope to have a Blue flock soon.    </p>    <p>      What Javas need now are opportunities on small farms across      the country. Their attitude, size, and meat and egg quality      make them ideal homestead birds. You don't have to live on      an old-fashioned farmstead to bring this important piece of      American agricultural history back from the edge of      oblivion. Just let us know you want to help.    </p>    <p>      For more information about the Java breed or to inquire      about starting your own Java flock, contact the Garfield      Farm Museum at info@garfieldfarm.org ; (630) 584-8485; or      Garfield Farm Museum, P.O.

Over 2,300 households from 37 states have      contributed to the grassroots effort to preserve this time      capsule as a working farm museum. Historic guided tours of      the farm can quickly lead to discussions of the current      loss of genetic diversity, farmland threatened by      development, the rarity of black-soil prairies or economics      that prevent starving populations access to the overflowing      cornucopia of American farmers. Founded by a few rare and      persistent individuals, the project is now acquiring the      second generation's 99-acre farm with a $2.5 million      fundraising campaign. Adding this farm will make expanded      rare breed preservation possible. Garfield is currently      home to milking Devon cattle, wrinkled Merino sheep,      Pilgrim geese, Narragansett turkeys and two Berkshire hogs.
