    <p>
                <p>      A treat designed for MOTHER . . . by the captain of the      U.S. "Culinary Olympics" Team.    </p>        <p>      Once every four years, since the turn of the century,      hundreds of master chefs have gathered to show of their      skills in the world's most prestigious professional cooking      contest, the International Culinary Competition . . . more      commonly known as the "Culinary Olympics".    </p>    <p>      In the 1980 event-which judged dishes on the basis of      preparation, taste, presentation, originality, and      nutritional value-the 14-member United States team      (representing the American Culinary Federation and      sponsored by the Foodservice Division of Kraft, Inc.) won      gold medals in both the hot- and cold-food competitions. We      were, therefore, quite interested when Klaus Friedenreich      (captain of the American team . . . owner/chef of Klaus'      Cuisine in Daytona Beach, Florida . . . and winner of an      individual gold medal for cold-food preparation) offered to      design a special Christmas feast just for MOTHER and all      her readers.    </p>    <p>      The master chef's menu begins with Fresh Vegetables With      Dip, followed by Cold Strawberry Soup and Kiwi Salad. Then      comes Stuffed Turkey Breast "Abington"-a spectacular      entree-accompanied by Potatoes With Cheese Filling,      Green Beans in Ginger Sauce, and Cranberry Orange Baskets.      And for the grand finale there's AppleCheese Torte.    </p>    <p>      Now we realize that Klaus's bill of fare produces a      downright extravagant repast that most folks would probably      put together only for a super-special occasion. But we also      thought that-whether you ever prepare the entire      feast or not-you'd like to see just how elegant such      wholesome, natural foods can be . . . and we're sure lots      of folks will want to sample at least a few of the      different dishes during the forthcoming holiday season.    </p>    <p>      The following recipes are designed to serve five or six      people, but the quantities can be increased to accommodate      additional guests.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FRESH VEGETABLES WITH DIP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Marinate 1 pound of fresh whole mushrooms for several hours      (or overnight) in lemon juice and olive oil.    </p>    <p>      Cut one large zucchini, 1 large yellow squash, 1 stalk of      celery, and 2 medium carrots into 2" strips . . . make      "roses" out of 15 radishes . . . and clean 8 scallions      (reserving the tips).    </p>    <p>      To make the luscious concoction that'll be scooped up with      your fresh vegetables, combine 1 cup of sour cream, 1/4 cup      of the marinated mushrooms (finely chopped), and the tips      of the scallions (minced). Season the mixture to taste with      Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, oregano, and white      pepper.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COLD STRAWBERRY SOUP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Process 2 cups of fresh (or unsweetened frozen)      strawberries, 1 cup of yogurt, 1 cup of milk, 3 tablespoons      of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon      of vanilla in a blender until the mix is smooth. (Be sure      to reserve 5 or 6 berries to slice and serve as a garnish      on top of the soup.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>KIWI SALAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      This treat is composed of 4 heads of bibb lettuce cut in      quarters . . . 8 cherry tomatoes . . . 2 Kiwi fruit (pared      and sliced) . . . and 1 cup of alfalfa sprouts.    </p>    <p>      And such tasty salad makings deserve a great dressing. To      prepare it, first combine 4 egg yolks, 2 tablespoons of      lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of white vinegar. Slowly      whip in 1 cup of salad oil, using a wire beater. Then stir      in 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 teaspoon of chopped tarragon      leaves, and salt and pepper to taste . . . and adjust the      mixture's thickness, if necessary, with up to 1/2 cup of      water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STUFFED TURKEY BREAST "ABINGTON"</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is the pièce de résistance of Klaus's      menu. To get started, cut a 3- to 4-pound whole turkey      breast off the bone, leaving the skin on. Remove the loose      fillet and set it aside. Now, laying the meat out      flat-skin side down-butterfly both sides,      cutting almost through the thickest portion of each half      and folding it back (as shown in the photographs, opposite      page). Slice off any high spots to make the entire slab      evenly thick throughout (you can cut away as much as a      third of the meat if necessary).    </p>    <p>      Next, grind the fillet and all the scraps of breast meat      with 8 to 10 ounces of salt pork. Put this ground mixture      through a food processor with 1 teaspoon of poultry spice,      and blend it to produce a very fine forcemeat.    </p>    <p>      With that done, mix the processed meat with 1/4 cup of      peeled pistachios, 1 cup of mixed dried fruit, and 1/2 cup      of fresh or frozen cranberries. Then saucé 1 small      onion (diced) with 1 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of      sliced celery, and add these ingredients to the meat      mixture.    </p>    <p>      Now, lay 6 thin slices of ham on the skinside-down turkey      breast, and pile the meat stuffing on top of the ham before      closing up the turkey (almost like shutting a book) and      tying it securely with butcher's string.    </p>    <p>      Finally, put the "package" in a roasting pan with some      celery, carrots, and onions. Add enough water to cover the      bottom of the pan, and place it in a 375°F oven for 1      to 1-1/4 hours . . . making sure you maintain enough water      to baste the meat every 10 minutes or so. When the turkey      is done, strain off the juices and thicken them with      cornstarch for a natural gravy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POTATOES WITH CHEESE FILLING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Wash 8 medium-sized red potatoes, coat them with oil, and      bake them until they're tender. After they're cool enough      to handle, cut the potatoes in half and remove a      melon-ball-sized amount of potato meat from the center of      each section. Go on to mix this with 2 ounces of crumbled      blue cheese, 2 ounces of shredded Parmesan, 2 ounces of      shredded provolone, and 1/2 cup of yogurt. Then use a cake      decorator bag to pipe the cheese mixture in and on the      potato halves . . . and put them back in a 375°F oven      for about 15 minutes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GREEN BEANS IN GINGER SAUCE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Cut up 2-1/2 to 3 pounds of fresh green beans and blanch      them in boiling, salted water. Then heat 4 ounces of      cottonseed or peanut oil to a slow simmer and add 1 ounce      of chopped fresh ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of wine vinegar, and      1 teaspoon of brown sugar. Sauté the beans in this      mixture . . . season them with salt and pepper . . .      and-finally-toss them with sliced almonds      before serving the dish.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRANBERRY ORANGE BASKETS</strong>    </p>    <p>      To make a colorful accompaniment for our holiday menu, chop      the peel of 1/2 orange and combine it (mixing thoroughly)      with an 8-ounce jar of whole cranberries. Serve the tart      relish in baskets made from hollowed-out oranges.    </p>    <p>      <strong>APPLE-CHEESE TORTE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Start the crust for this delicious dessert by creaming      together 1/2 cup of butter, 1/3 cup of sugar, and 1/4      teaspoon of vanilla. Then blend in 1 cup of flour, and      spread the resulting dough over the bottom, and halfway up      the wall, of a 9" spring-form pan.    </p>    <p>      Next, prepare the filling. Combine 8 ounces of cream      cheese, 1/4 cup of sugar (you could, of course, use a date      sugar if you prefer), 1 egg, and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla,      and pour the mixture into the crust. Over this, spread a      topping made from 1/3 cup of sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of      cinnamon, and 4 cups of peeled and sliced apples. Sprinkle      the surface with 1/2 cup of sliced almonds.    </p>    <p>      Bake the torte in a preheated 400°F oven for 10      minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350°F and allow the      dish to cook for 25 minutes more. Let the finished delicacy      cool before removing it from the pan . . . cut it into      slices . . . and put a big dab of heavy whipped cream,      garnished with a few more sliced almonds, on top of each      serving.    </p>    <p>      Bon appetite    </p>
