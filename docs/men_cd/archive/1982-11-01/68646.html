                <p>      <em>It's hard to beat the joy of sharing a bottle of      beverage made from your own vineyard harvest.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Kenneth Balliet    </h5>        <p>      A glass of crisp white wine-or perhaps of a hearty      red-is the perfect accompaniment to good food and      fellowship . . . and that drink can be all the more special      if it's a product of your own labor. Yet, though many      amateur vintners consistently make superior beverages, most      folks still avoid "putting up" their own wine.    </p>    <p>      However, despite the fact that the winemaking process is      indeed somewhat complex and results in occasional      disappointments, it's not all that difficult-if      you're ready to spend some winter days in      preparation-to establish a small vineyard and turn      its harvest into high-quality table wines. This article,      then, is a practical, result-oriented introduction to the      art of home viticulture and winemaking.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GRAPES: THE KEY INGREDIENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      All experienced vintners will agree on at least one point:      Only a quality grape will produce a superior wine. It's      simply not possible to make a prize-winning Bordeaux with      the fruit of a common backyard vine. And, unfortunately,      the classic European winemaking grape varieties (Vitis      vinifera) are delicate in nature and will grow only in a      few select areas of the country . . . primarily along the      California coast.    </p>    <p>      Luckily, however, this problem's been solved . . . thanks      to the introduction of a family of grapes called French      hybrids into the United States. These unique vines are      crosses between American and European varieties, and have      inherited the good qualities of both strains: That is, they      typically blend the hardiness and disease resistance of      their local ancestors with the delicate traditional flavor      of their overseas parents. A number of these hybrids are      now widely available from local nurseries or through mail      order suppliers. Here are six favorites . . . the first      three suited for making red wine and the second trio      appropriate for a "white" beverage.    </p>        <p>      Baco Noir: a disease-resistant, early ripening variety for      short-season areas. The wine made from these grapes is      generally similar to red Bordeaux.    </p>    <p>      Foch: an extra-early ripening type fit for cold      northeastern climates. You'll find its wine is often akin      to Burgundy.    </p>    <p>      Chelois: a vigorous producer that's best suited to regions      with moderately long growing seasons.    </p>    <p>      Aurora: a hardy variety for locales with very short growing      seasons. It is used to produce a pale, delicate white wine,      and is a standard in New York's Finger Lakes region.    </p>    <p>      Seyval Blanc: a short-season variety. It typically results      in a clean, brisk, superior wine.    </p>    <p>      Villard Blanc: a type suited for regions s with long      growing seasons. You'll find it o both hardy and vigorous.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ESTABLISHING YOUR VINEYARD</strong>    </p>        <p>      Of course, before you actually buy any nursery stock,      you'll have to decide how many plants you'll need . . .      whether you want to produce red or white wine (or both) . .      . and the specific types) of grape you prefer. To narrow      down the search, you might well want to ask your extension      agent-or perhaps a local vineyard owner-about      the varieties of vines that are best suited to your      particular region.    </p>    <p>      When preparing to put in your order, you should also keep      in mind that-though individual yields do vary      greatly-you can expect, within five years, an annual      average of about eight pounds of fruit per vine from most      hybrids . . . which is enough to make approximately      six-tenths of a gallon of wine. A vineyard consisting of      ten plants, then, will produce about six gallons of the      beverage every year.    </p>        <p>      Next, go on to establish the vineyard's layout . . .      choosing a sunny, well-drained site, preferably with a      gentle slope. To determine space requirements, plan to      place the vines six to ten feet apart in rows spaced at      eight- to ten-foot intervals. Then prepare the area by      working up the ground well and tilling under generous      amounts of organic matter and fertilizer . . . you may want      to have a soil test done to determine what is needed.      (Don't add lime, though, because grapevines prefer acidic      soil.)    </p>    <p>      When the plants arrive in the spring, remove them from the      absorbent wrapping in which they were likely shipped and      place their roots in a bucket of water so that they won't      dry out. Your new vines will haw been grown from cuttings      taken from a parent plant. [EDITOR'S NOTE: It's possible to      produce your own stock from clippings . . . see "Grow Your      Own Grapes", MOTHER NO. 61, page 76. (To order back issues,      turn to page 48.) And Mr. Digwell, on page 181, has more      vine advice.) Each immature grape bearer wilt consist of an      original length of stalk with the roots at the lower end      and some stubbier, branchlike growth at the upper tip.      Place the plants, roots down (each along with a few      handfuls of compost), into holes dug at properly spaced      intervals. Then simply cover them with soil to the point      where the top branches begin and prune off all but two or      three bud eyes per cane. Finally, to support the coming      season's growth, drive a four-foot stake into the ground      next to each plant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ART OF VITICULTURE</strong>    </p>        <p>      You'll find that managing your vineyard during the first      season is a fairly trouble-free and enjoyable task. In      fact, your sole aim for this year will be to make sure that      the plants develop the strong, upright, wellshaped trunks      that will support the vines for the rest of their lives.    </p>    <p>      As the weather warms, each bud eye left on during the      planting process will burst open and produce a bright green      shoot. Select the most vigorous cane among these, and rub      off all the others. The remaining branch will mature to      form the vine's permanent trunk. Later in the season, as      the plant grows, carefully tie it (not too tightly!) to the      stake at six- to eight-inch intervals to keep it straight.      You should also eliminate all competition by removing any      new unwanted shoots as they appear. And, with the exception      of normal garden maintenance, that's all there is to caring      for your grapes during their first year.    </p>    <p>      When the following spring arrives, you can begin the      vineyard's second season by building a trellis. This      structure might simply consist of two or three horizontal      wires (use No. 10 galvanized) strung on posts placed 15 to      20 feet apart. Fasten the lowest to each upright line at a      point 2-1/2 to 3 feet above the ground, and the highest      about 5 feet. Then, to strengthen the fence, brace the end      supports with guy wires.    </p>    <p>      Now, cut back each vine so that the trunk extends slightly      above the bottom wire. And, once the new growth shows and      all danger of frost has passed, rub off all shoots except      for the top four. These small branches will later develop      into the large canes that will form the plant's foliage and      eventually bear the fruit.    </p>    <p>      As spring progresses, cultivate the soil occasionally to      keep weeds in check, orif enough organic material is      availablemulch the entire plot. (The latter approach is      more desirable, since it both feeds the soil and virtually      eliminates further chores until harvest time.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRUNING AND TRAINING</strong>    </p>    <p>      The key to successfully managing your vineyard during      subsequent years is to simply understand-and      apply-the principles of pruning and training.      Pruning, as you likely know, is the act of cutting away      some of the vine during the dormant season in order to      regulate its growth, and-as a result-improve      the quality of the crop. Training, on the other hand, is      the process of arranging the bearing canes on the trunk      that gives the vine its permanent shape and form.    </p>        <p>      Many folks find grape-pruning practices confusing at first,      but the theory behind them is straightforward. Put simply,      each season's new growth springs from the bud eyes on the      one-year-old wood. Pruning is just removing all but a      select portion of this growth. Your aim is to leave only      enough to bear the crop and to grow renewal wood for the      next year.    </p>        <p>      If pruning is the tactic that keeps a vine's size in check,      then training is a long-term strategy involving the      placement of the canes and spurs ... and the fashion in      which they're arranged on the trellis. Two commonly used      techniques are the four-arm Kniffin and the High-Renewal      systems (Figs. 1 and 2). These methods differ with regard      to form, but are functionally about the same. The Kniffin      is the most popular training system in the East, and the      HighRenewal method, which is used widely in Europe for the      French hybrids, is less formally structured and somewhat      easier to implement. (See the illustrations and the sidebar      for more information.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>A TRIP THROUGH THE SEASON</strong>    </p>    <p>      Let's say that it's the beginning of your young vineyard's      third season. You've finished pruning, and-after a      long stretch of warm April weather-the buds on the      bearing canes swell, parting the hard scales that protect      each fruit eye. Soon the puffy nodes burst, sprouting tiny      velvet shoots with brilliant carmine and green leaves.      These small branch tips grow with astonishing vigor,      unfolding leaves and clinging tendrils as they snake along      the trellis, and quickly reach lengths of four feet to six      feet. Several weeks later tiny flower clusters, called      "inflorescences", appear. Then-soon after      pollination-the blossom caps fall, the ovaries ripen,      and the vintage is born.    </p>    <p>      As the season progresses, the foliage thickens, and the      bunches of green fruit grow plump ... until their combined      weight strains the trellis support. Later, however, growth      slows noticeably . . . the wood on the canes begins to      harden . . . and the berries begin to show a faint blush of      color.    </p>    <p>      Near the end of the summer, the grapes turn ripe and soft,      decorating the vineyard with splashes of red, blue, purple,      and translucent-white fruit.    </p>    <p>      At this point important natural processes      occur-inside the pulp-that will affect the      quality of your wine. As the grapes ripen, you see, they      increase in sugar content (which will give the beverage      both alcohol content and body) and simultaneously decrease      in acid content (which influences the tartness of the      wine).    </p>    <p>      Harvest time, then, is a period of great anguish for all      vineyard keepers. Pick too soon and you risk making sour,      puckery wine. Wait too long and you take a chance of losing      your now fragile crops to birds, insects, or frost. No firm      guidance can be given as to when to gather the yield,      either . . . as a master vintner that decision is up to      you.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WINEMAKING: LEARN THE BASICS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Turning grapes into wine is a complex, natural biological      and chemical process. Simply stated, the sugar in the fruit      juice (the "must") is transformed-through a series of      stages-by the action of yeast into almost equal parts      of alcohol and carbon dioxide. Grapes with a 20% sugar      content, then, will result in a 20-proof (10% alcohol)      wine. In addition, the vinous beverage will contain small      amounts of complex acids, tannins, and other trace      ingredients that impart aroma and flavor.    </p>    <p>      Despite the complexity of the chain of events that produces      fine vintages, though, your role as winemaker is really      quite straightforward. The most important factor in      guaranteeing consistent success is to fully understand two      basic principles and to apply them faithfully: Keep your      equipment and work area clean and orderly at all times, and      provide the physical and environmental conditions required      to insure the success of the natural winemaking process.      These rules will be discussed in some detail, and their      importance cannot be overstated.    </p>    <p>      As a beginning enologist (or winemaker), you'll of course      have to round up the necessary equipment. Economy and      resourcefulness are the bywords here. There's really little      need to buy high-priced gadgets or beginners' kits.      Scrounge, build, or borrow instead. Here's a list of the      basic tools and ingredients.    </p>    <p>      Fermentor: Use a food-grade, high-quality plastic bucket or      a new trash container.    </p>    <p>      Hydrometer: This implement is used to measure potential      alcohol content and is an inexpensive, but crucial, tool.      You can find one at a home-winemaking supply house.    </p>    <p>      Aging containers: Use one- to five-gallon glass jugs.    </p>    <p>      Winemaking yeast: This is good success insurance, as it      guarantees a quick, clean fermentation with none of the      aftertaste often produced by baker's yeast.    </p>    <p>      Crusher: You can, perhaps, borrow one . . . or make your      own from scrap lumber by building an opened-topped box and      then drilling oneinch holes, on three-inch centers, in its      bottom. Crush the grapes by rubbing the bunches against the      board. In this manner, the pulp falls through the holes      into the fermentor, while most of the stems will stay on      top to be thrown out.    </p>    <p>      Press: This is a costly, but necessary, item. Try to borrow      one . . . but if none is available, make your own. The      device can be as simple as two boards hinged together at      one end and used, like a nutcracker, to squeeze the juice      out of pulp contained in a nylon bag.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CREATE A HEARTY RED WINE</strong>    </p>    <p>      The process for making red wine begins on harvest day.      First, scrub your equipment with washing soda and water.      Then, pick the grape clusters and bring them, without      delay, to the wine cellar to be crushed.    </p>    <p>      Crushing is a brief and messy, but cheerful, affair. The      idea is to simply pop each grape open so the yeast can work      on the exposed pulp. And this is the one time in the entire      winemaking process when you can be a bit sloppy, since a      few unbroken grapes-or even stems and      leaves-dropped into the fermentor will make little      difference. However, once you've finished, do be sure to      scrub, rinse, and dry the equipment again. Remember,      uncleanliness nurtures bacteria that can ruin a batch of      wine.    </p>    <p>      Next, adjust the sugar content of the must to insure that      you'll produce a beverage with an alcohol content of 10% to      12%. This will give the beverage stability and the proper      tang. Sugar concentration is read with the hydrometer,      which works by measuring specific gravity. Merely float the      device in a sample of juice and read the thermometerlike      scale. If necessary, stir sugar into the must until the      instrument reads 12% alcohol by volume . . . or shows a      specific gravity of about 1.088.    </p>    <p>      Having established the proper conditions, add one packet of      dried concentrated winemaker's yeast for each five gallons      of must, and cover the container to keep out foreign matter      and fruit flies.    </p>    <p>      Fermentation should begin within 24 hours. First, a bubble      or two will appear . . . then more. In a short time, the      surface will be covered with a layer of foam. Soon the      entire mixture will be fermenting with vigor. The      concoction will release a pungent odor when the cover is      lifted. The skins and pulp will rise to the surface and      form a cakelike mess called the chapeau. Stir this back      into the juice several times daily.    </p>    <p>      The violent fermentation usually subsides within four to      six days. Once it does slow down, separate the juice from      the seeds, skins, and pulp by pressing the must. To do      this, simply bail the entire contents of the fermentor into      the press basket. At first, the new wine will flow into      your waiting glass jugs on its own. The last of the liquid,      however, must be squashed out of the soggy fruit. Apply      pressure gradually and continue in this manner until the      pulp is dry. The leftover mass, called "pomace", can be      returned to the vineyard soil as fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      Now, clean your equipment and make sure all containers of      wine are filled to the neck. From this point on, you must      not expose your beverage to outside air, which could cause      it to spoil. Cap each jug with an air lock (this can be as      simple as a plastic baggie and a rubber band). Then, after      all signs of fermentation have ended, stopper the      containers and store them in a cool, safe place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHIP UP A WONDERFUL WHITE</strong>    </p>    <p>      With the exception of one crucial step, the process for      making white wine is similar to that for preparing red. The      primary difference is that you must crush and press the      grapes immediately after they're picked. In other words,      conduct the operation in this order: harvest, crush, then      press, adjust for sugar content, and ferment. When the wine      becomes still, you can store it-in filled, tightly      stopped glass jugs-along with its red cousin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE SECONDARY FERMENTATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Whatever its color, you should let your young beverage rest      undisturbed until late December. After this period, it will      have cleared considerably . . . and, as a result of a      phenomenon called secondary (or malolactic) fermentation,      its acid content will have diminished. Now's the time to      purify your creation, removing the sediment (called the      "lees") by way of a procedure known as "racking".    </p>    <p>      This step is accomplished by carefully siphoning the liquid      off the lees into another clean container, using a short      length of clean plastic tubing or flexible hose. As the      siphon slowly empties the jugs, keep lowering the tubing      until it just begins to draw off the deposit at the bottom      and then halt the flow. (Make sure the new jugs are filled      to the neck and stoppered tightly.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, feasting and merriment are appropriate to      celebrate a purification rite such as racking, so be      prepared by setting aside a sampler of the new vintage.      Then invite family and friends to a hearty meal,      highlighted by a taste of the new homemade brew. Your wine      should have a mild, fruit bouquet at this stage, but may      taste slightly "green". Don't worry, though, because the      beverage has yet to go through its timeconsuming finishing      stage ... and sonic good things just can't be hurried.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINISHING THE WINE</strong>    </p>    <p>      The last step in the winemaking process requires only      patient waiting. Let the bottles lie undisturbed until      about February, then rack them again. Later, before hot      weather comes, siphon the wine off any accumulated sediment      a third time and then bottle it permanently . . . either in      screwcapped gallon jugs or in corked bottles.    </p>    <p>      Finally, at the end of the first summer after bottling,      your wine will be ready to drink. Don't plan on aging it      more than two years, because homemade beverage is best      consumed young. And if you've followed these guidelines,      you should find your labors rewarded by a superior dry      table wine that'll hold its own against commercial products      sold at many times the price . . . and, best of all, you'll      have earned the right to label your vintage "Estate      Bottled"!    </p>                <p>      <strong>EDITOR'S NOTE:</strong> For all of its length, this      article provides only a brief introduction to the art of      home viticulture and winemaking. You might want to read      over some of the dozens of good books about both subjects      that are on the market. (A Wine-Grower's Guide by Philip M.      Wagner-Alfred Knopf, $10.95-is art      easy-to-follow, practical reference book.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRUNING TECHNIQUES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although a dormant grapevine might look like a confusing      tangle of woody canes, pruning it won't be a difficult task      if you know what to look for. The wood to be removed (last      year's growth) will be smooth and light brown, with many      new buds. By contrast, the older wood (the trunk and other      semipermanent parts) will be thick and dark, and its bark      will hang in shaggy strips.    </p>    <p>      The accompanying illustrations, even though greatly      simplified, show which canes should be cut away during      pruning. Fig. A depicts a newly pruned vine with a single      cane and spur. The long branch (the bearing cane) will      produce the coming year's crop. And in the following      spring, it and all of its secondary growth will be removed.      The short branch (called the renewal spur) will provide the      growth that will produce that season's new cane-and-spur      combination.    </p>    <p>      Fig. B shows the some plant at the end of the season with      dormant canes extending from each original bud eye. To      prune your vine, eliminate the bearing cane that bore last      year's crop, and use the two canes that grew from the buds      on last year's renewal spur to farm this year's      cane-and-spur combination.    </p>    <p>      To accomplish this, simply refer to the dotted lines shown      in Fig. B, forming the bearing cane by cutting one branch      back to between six and ten bud eyes . . . then farm the      spur by cutting the other branch back to two buds as in      Fig. C.    </p>    <p>      Most vigorous plants will support four cane-and-spur      combinations. Use these same guidelines when you prune the      entire vine. just be sure to carefully select the location      of your cuts to maintain the plant's shape and intended      training form.    </p>
