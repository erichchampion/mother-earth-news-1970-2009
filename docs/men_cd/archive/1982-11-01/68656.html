    <p>
                <p>      It now appears that the lantern-long a standby source      of light-may pose a health threat.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Mary Anderson    </h5>        <p>      The warm yellow glow of an open-flame kerosene lamp is      comforting and-under the right      circumstances-even romantic, but almost anyone who's      tried to read by the light of one of the standard wick-type      lanterns fully appreciates the usefulness of the mantle      lamp. When the mantle (a small cylindrical hood,      which-when placed over a flame-becomes white      hot and gives off very bright light) was incorporated into      the design of gas, kerosene, and oil lamps about 100 years      ago, the light intensity of such devices jumped from about      15 watts to nearly 60. With this refinement, folks were      significantly more able to continue their daytime      activities after darkness fell than they'd ever been      before!    </p>    <p>      Today, many campers and residents of nonelectrified areas      (as well as individuals who have chosen to do without      electricity) rely on light provided by mantle lamps for      reading, sewing, and other close work . . . and they've      been pretty clanged grateful for that eye-saving      illumination, too. However, although most people are      unaware of the problem, the mantles in such lamps are      actually radioactive . . . possibly enough so to threaten      the health of folks who depend on them.    </p>        <p>      The mantles used on modern lanterns acquire their      radioactive properties during the manufacturing process.      First, the fabric that will eventually form the small rayon      mesh pouches is dipped into a solution of thorium and      cerium nitrates. The nitrates are then precipitated into      the cloth with ammonia, and-after it's      dried-the mantle is coated with nitrocellulose, which      fixes the ammonia salts and improves the preburning      capability of the material. Occasionally, a manufacturer      will also add a small amount of beryllium to give the ash      (the residue that's left behind after the lantern's      nitrocellulose-assisted initial burn) greater strength.      However, it's the thorium in the mantle that incandesces      and gives off the functional white light.    </p>        <p>      Unfortunately, that same element is radioactive. It      is-to be more precise-an      alpha-particle-emitting radioisotope which has a decay      series of ten radiodaughters (a "daughter" is an element      that is an immediately produced by-product of the      disintegration of a radioactive element). The first      radiodaughter is radium 228, a betaemitter which-in      time-produces subsequent alpha-emitting      radiodaughters.    </p>    <p>      The difference between alpha and beta particles is an      important one for lantern users to understand. Both types      of emissions are referred to as short-range radiation:      Alpha particles are large and slowmoving, and can easily be      stopped by such a barrier as a piece of paper or the glass      chimney of a lantern . . . while beta particles are smaller      and faster, and can penetrate body tissue. Either type can      pose a health risk to the body if its emitters (in this      particular case, thorium and radium) are inhaled or      ingested . . . with the alpha particle being the more      dangerous.    </p>        <p>      Inside the body, you see, "alphas" often travel a distance      equal only to a cell's diameter, concentrating their effect      in one tiny location. Therefore, alpha energy can overwhelm      a cell's chemistry, possibly targeting the stricken spot      for a future cancer, or altering the cells genetic matter.      (EDITOR'S NOTE: Refer to the Medical Self-Care column "Are      Cigarettes Radioactive?" (issue 74) for a discussion 'of      the health effects of lowlevel radiation. To order back      issues, turn to page 48.1    </p>    <p>      The manufacturers of lanterns and mantles (Coleman and      Aladdin are the largest of such firms) are well aware of      thorium's radioactive properties, since they must be      licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to possess      and process the material and, furthermore, are required to      label bulk shipments of the mantles as "radioactive" during      transport. However, the companies have rejected any      suggestion that they put warning labels on individual      mantle packages, maintaining that the level of      radiotoxicity is "insignificant".    </p>    <p>      The industry position is based, in part, on a 1979 study by      Milo Voss-a health physicist from Ames,      Iowa-which characterized the alpha-emitting nature of      thorium as relatively harmless unless the particles are      ingested or inhaled. Even if the risk is that limited,      though, there's a strong likelihood that an unsuspecting      individual could breathe in airborne radioactivity, without      being aware of it, while lighting a mantle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONSUMER ACTION</strong>    </p>        <p>      Until recently, only a few people were informed of the      health risks posed by mantle lamps. Some mention of the      issue had been made in several California newspapers, but      no widespread attention had been drawn to the problem.    </p>    <p>      In fact, if it hadn't been for Walter Wagner, a health      physicist employed by the Veterans Administration Medical      Center in San Francisco, the entire matter might have      escaped large-scale public notice. As it happened, though,      Wagner toured the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant near      Sacramento, California in October 1980 . . .      and-during his visit-a health physicist      employed there pulled out a lantern mantle. The man never      explained why he was carrying that small cloth pocket at a      nuclear electricity-generating plant, but-in      retrospect-Wagner suspects that the physicist may      have been trying to point out that nuclear plant employees      aren't the only ones exposing the public to radioactivity.    </p>        <p>      At any rate, what struck Wagner about the incident was that      the mantle registered on the scintillation counter he'd      brought along on the tour. He was surprised, because      thorium is an alpha-emitter, and most such particles should      have been stopped by the packaging. Reflecting on it later,      Wagner decided that the counter was not registering thorium      at all, but-instead-indicating the presence of      some of its decay elements . . . so he bought a mantle to      experiment with.    </p>    <p>      After confirming his theory, Walt contacted the Coleman      Company in March 1981 to ask the firm to put warnings on      mantle packages. When that effort proved unsuccessful,      Wagner filed a $300 million class action suit, in November      1981, against the Coleman Company and other manufacturers      of mantles . . . which seeks to return reputed damages to      mantle purchasers and to require the companies to begin      using warning labels on their products.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THORIUM AND HEALTH RISKS</strong>    </p>    <p>      By way of a little background, the thorium (Th-232) that's      used in lanterns is a fertile nuclide, which can actually      be bred into uranium 233 (U-233), a fissionable isotope      suitable for nuclear weapons or reactors. (In fact, thorium      itself has been used in reactors on an experimental basis      and supposedly could have been bred into weapons-grade      U-233 at the Osirak nuclear power plant located near      Baghdad, Iraq, which was de stroyed by the Israelis on June      7, 1981.)    </p>    <p>      In a home or tent, the main danger in mantle use arises      from thorium's first radiodaughter, radium 228 (Ra-228).      Radium is a "bone seeker" . . . which means that it is      biochemically analogous to calcium, and that the body will      substitute it for calcium during periods of bone growth.      Thus, the radiumladen fumes from lamp mantles present an      obvious hazard to children who may be close by. Likewise,      pregnant women and their unborn babies-could be      endangered, since Ra-228 (and Ra-224), which can be inhaled      and ingested by the mother, readily crosses the placental      barrier and can be absorbed by the fetus. Similarly, a      nursing mother who inhales volatized radium would pass some      of it along to her infant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TAKING PRECAUTIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      While the chief sources of danger are the      alpha-particle-emitting daughters of Ra-228, Wagner says      that "significant" beta radiation can strike the body when      a mantle is placed close to the skin. If it's carried in a      shirt pocket, for instance, the breast and lung tissue will      absorb radiation . . . and if it's put in a pants pocket, a      man's testicles would be exposed to some low-level      radiation (though the actual risk involved in either case      is, at present, subject to debate). Wagner cautions that a      mantle-even when it's new and still inside its      packaging-should never be placed in pockets, and      children should never be allowed to touch or play with the      devices.    </p>    <p>      The Physicist further advises that the initial preburning,      and all subsequent lighting, of mantles be performed in an      open area with adequate air circulation . . . and that only      after 15 to 20 minutes of burning should a mantle lamp be      brought into a closed environment. What's more, Wagner      notes that the thorium is in place even after the mantle      has been burning. You see, one of the reasons manufacturers      use thorium is that it has a very high melting point.      Therefore, a mantle will continue to emit alpha radiation      during use, with most of these particles being stopped by      the glass chimney. On the other hand, once the mantle is      lighted, most of the radium will boil off in the first 15      to 20 minutes, and the mantle won't emit further beta      radiation until several days later . . . when Ra-224 is      produced by the decaying thorium.    </p>    <p>      Wagner suggests that if you light your lamp once a day, it      should be vented to the outdoors. If the lantern is used      continuously, however, venting is probably not necessary,      as the air change in the room should be adequate.    </p>    <p>      Users of mantle lamps should especially avoid breathing in      the particulate ash or getting any ash in their food.      ("Thorium ash is very bad to inhale," Walter says, "as it      simply sits in the lungs for months to years, and when it      eventually gets into the blood, it goes directly to the      bone, where-again-it stays for years.")    </p>    <p>      It's impossible, of course, to avoid some exposure while      changing the mantles . . . however, since that procedure      normally requires only a few minutes, the total risk is      small (less than one chance in a million of a resulting      cancer). By contrast, leaving a mantle in a pocket for      hours at a time increases the risk of cancer considerably      (up to one chance in 10,000).    </p>    <p>      When it comes time to dispose of a mantle, Wagner suggests      that the ashes not be deposited on a compost heap or tilled      into garden soil, where the radiotoxicity could become part      of the food chain. Rather, it's better to put the old      mantle with trash that will be going to a landfill or other      dump.    </p>    <p>      Given all the facts, why haven't mantle manufacturers      admitted the hazard of thorium? That's a question Walt      hopes to have answered when the suit comes to trial.      (Following two postponements, a hearing is scheduled-      as of this writing-for September or October of this      year.) Coleman has called Wagner's allegations      "preposterous" and charged that his conclusions are more      "emotional than scientific".    </p>    <p>      In return, Wagner's suit claims that 1,000 persons have      already suffered cancer or birth defects through improper      use of the mantles . . . that 1,000 more will be stricken      as a result of past exposure . . . and that manufacturers      have been negligent by failing to warn users and to advise      them of safety precautions that might have lessened or      prevented injury.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the welcome white light for nighttime reading isn't      as necessary-or as benign-as we thought.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter Wagner, the radiation physicist who      initiated the mantle suit against the Coleman Company and      others, is the discoverer of the first piece of substantial      evidence of the existence of magnetic monopoles, subatomic      particles previously thought to exist but sought after for      many years without success. Wagner's breakthrough occurred      in 1975, while he was working on a physics experiment at      the University of California at Berkeley.    </p>		      <p>      NOTE: All readings were taken with the Radiation Alert      Monitor 4 detector from a measuring distance of 1/8 inch.      All readings were averaged during a 30-second exposure      time. The Coleman 220 was taken on a camping trip during      the three-day test interval, during which it was burned      outdoors for about 36 hours . . . while the Coleman 5114      remained unlighted back in the laboratory. It's interesting      to note that there's quite a difference between the      three-day readings for the two lamps, both of which are      equipped with a pair of mantles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT'S HOT . . . AND WHAT'S NOT</strong>    </p>        <p>      When MOTHER'S staffers decided to test lantern mantles far      radiation while checking out Mary Anderson's story, we      asked Walter Wagner for some tips on exactly what we should      be looking for. He said that-with the right      equipment-we should be able to record radioactivity      emanating from the mantles at several stages . . . in the      package, out of the package, during the preburn phase, and      several days later when the thorium coating produces radium      as a decay product.    </p>    <p>      Thus informed, we turned to the folks at Solar      Electronics-a group connected with The Farm in      Summertown, Tennessee-for advice about how to monitor      the mantles. They furnished us with a Solar      Electronics-made instrument-the Radiation Alert      Monitor 4-which turned out to be a small, hand-held      radiation detector that's sensitive to a broad spectrum of      ionizing radiation . .. including alpha and beta particles,      gamma rays, and X-rays.    </p>        <p>      Next, we gathered up several lanterns that used the suspect      mantles and performed an informal experiment to check for      radioactivity. Admittedly, our research was by no means      controlled (for instance, one of the staffers borrowed a      lantern for a weekend camping expedition during the rest,      and thereby inadvertently provided some information on an      in-use mantle) . none of us is trained in radiation      detection . . . and our facilities are not equipped to      measure-or control-the temperature at which      each lantern burns.    </p>    <p>      However, despite such limitations, we were able to obtain      the results Walt Wagner told us we would: The lantern      mantles are radioactive . . . and this radioactivity      persists because the thorium is producing a radioactive      chain of decay products. Thus, the figures in the chart on      the preceding page are useful for comparing the      radioactivity of several types of mantles employed in a      variety of lanterns.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the main point of MOM'S little test, though, was      that it awakened us to the prevalence of sources of      low-level radiation. It's only recently that medical      journals and other health forums have started discussing a      possible link between      lower-than-previously-assumed-dangerous levels of radiation      and cancer. The big question, of course, is what dosage of      low-level radiation places a human being at risk. This may      never be adequately answered (and there may well be no      "safe" dosage).    </p>    <p>      When we were talking to Dan Sythe at The Farm and mentioned      the results of our mantle experiment, he pointed out that      some people wear or carry watches that emit more radiation      than a lantern mantle . . . many old timepieces and clocks      were painted with radium to illuminate the dials (other      substances are used today). Household radiation sources      also include smoke detectors, old kitchen timers, and      static eliminators (devices used to reduce static on film      and records).    </p>    <p>      Still another source is old pottery or crockery that's      decorated with red or orange glaze (the coloring can      contain uranium). The orange plate pictured on a previous      page-shown registering 0.5 milliroentgens (mR) per      hour of radiation-belongs to a staff member . . .      it's among a set of 1940's-vintage Fiesta ware that she was      given by her grandmother.    </p>    <p>      And while we were exploring sources of radiation, we      recalled recent warnings concerning the health risk of      radon . . . a radioactive gas that's naturally present in      nearly all rocks and soil, as well as in building materials      such as brick or concrete. It appears that radon is more      concentrated in airtight, energy-efficient structures than      in others for at least two reasons: These buildings      frequently rely on rock, brick, or concrete for heat sinks      . . . and-because care is taken to minimize hear      leakage-the air in such houses isn't changed very      often. Therefore, more radon is produced and allowed to      accumulate in the efficient dwellings.    </p>    <p>      We were interested enough, therefore, to check MOM'S      house-the earth-bermed, hybrid solar structure at the      Eco-Village-to determine whether it produces      higher-than-normal levels of radiation. The structure      didn't budge the detector's needle, though . . . but then,      the house is located in-and largely built of      materials from-a relatively old geographic region      where naturally occurring levels of radiation are not as      high as in some other parts of the United States.    </p>    <p>      In short, using the detector helped awaken us to the fact      that low-level radiation is fairly prevalent . . . often in      common, readily available consumer items. And as an      outgrowth of their cooperation with MOTHER on this story,      the folks at Solar Electronics have decided to make two      types of instruments available to readers who might want to      do some testing in their own homes or workplaces.    </p>    <p>      The Radiation Alert Monitor 4 has a meter that directly      reads in milliroentgens (mR) per hour . . . plus a count      light and "beeper" function. Three meter ranges allow      detection of radiation levels up to 50 mR/hour, or up to      5,000 times natural background levels. Essentially, the      instrument is a mini-Geiger counter for making precise      measurements. A Radiation Alert Monitor 4 costs $150, plus      $5.00 for shipping charges.    </p>    <p>      Another detector that some of you might find interesting is      the Radiation Alert- Mini. This is a small      instrument-which can be clipped in a shirt pocket or      on a belt-designed to alert a person who is exposed      to radioactivity by sounding an alarm. While there's no      meter, the device does have a three-level alarm system of      flashing LED's (light-emitting diodes) and audible tones.    </p>    <p>      According to Mr. Sythe, the Radiation AlertMini would      provide good insurance for someone who might be exposed to      radioactivity during the course of his or her work, or who      lives in a "risk" area (perhaps close to a nuclear power      plant) and would like to know about it if radiation levels      were suddenly to surge. The Radiation Alert-Minis are      available for $199 each (a unit customarily sells for      $249.50, but Solar Electronics is discounting the device      for MOTHER-readers only), plus $5.00 for shipping.    </p>    <p>      These radiation detectors can be ordered, far the prices      mentioned above, from Solar Electronics, Dept. TMEN, 156      Drakes Lane, Summertown, Tennessee 38383. If you'd like to      obtain more information about either device, simply write      (please enclose a dollar or two to help defray mailing      expenses) and request brochures. Or you might want to      inquire about discounts on bulk orders (Solar Electronics      has recently supplied a number of Radiation Alert-Minis to      companies whose employees may be exposed to excessive      radiation levels).    </p>
