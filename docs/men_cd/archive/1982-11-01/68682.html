                <p>      <strong>An old-world entree to brighten winter menus:</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Karen Ducayne</strong>    </p>        <p>      Unfortunately, about the time of year when dinner starts to      become the highlight of an otherwise drab winter day, the      meals-alas-often seem to be infected by the      sameness of the gray weather. And when that happens, it's      time for the chief cook to broaden his or her recipe      repertoire. (Of course, if the resulting new dish is      delicious, relatively inexpensive to prepare, filling, and      unusual enough to intrigue the jaded palates of      adults-yet not repel the suspicious tastebuds of      small fry-so much the better.)    </p>    <p>      Well, I'm proposing the perfect candidate for chasing away      the I'm-tired-of-casserole/ boiled-dinner/stew blues:      pierogi, little ribsticking stuffed dumplings. They're      among my family's favorite cold-weather foods, and I'm      pretty confident that they'll get a warm reception at your      dinner table, too. The recipe was passed along to me by my      Ukrainian grandmother, and will probably look familiar to      folks of Slavic descent.    </p>    <p>      The name (it's also spelled "pirogi" and "pieroghi") is the      plural form of the Russian word pirog, which means a small      turnover or pie. And although the Russians claim credit for      developing this particular dish, one form or another of the      dumpling-including Italian ravioli and American fried      pies-appears in almost every nation's cuisine.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PIEROGI PASTRY</strong>    </p>    <p>      My recipe is slightly time-consuming, so it might be a good      idea to prepare it the day before you actually want to      serve your pierogi, or at least to set aside an afternoon      in which to tackle it. There are two parts to the      turnovers, so I'll start with instructions for making the      dough. You'll need these ingredients:    </p>    <p>      3 cups of unbleached flour<br />      1/2 teaspoon of salt<br />      1 egg (slightly beaten)<br />      3/4 cup of water    </p>    <p>      Combine the flour and salt in a bowl, add the slightly      beaten egg, and then stir in just enough water to make a      ball of dough. The pastry will be stiff, but you should be      able to roll it out, using a little muscle (if it's really      unmanageable, add another splash of water). Lightly flour a      board or countertop, and roll the dough to an even 1/8" to      1/16" in thickness.    </p>    <p>      Once that's done, cut out some circles, using a 3"-diameter      biscuit cutter or perhaps the floured rim of a glass.      (Actually, I prefer to slice the      pastry-freehand-into small rectangles, using a      sharp knife, since this practice allows me to make use of      odd sections and all but eliminates the need for kneading      and rerolling scraps.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>FANCIFUL FILLINGS</strong>    </p>        <p>      In the center of each pastry section, place a teaspoonful      of stuffing. Just about anything that suits your family      makes an appropriate filling. My personal favorite is      mashed potatoes (don't add any liquid), into which I stir      grated cheddar cheese, minced onion, and salt and pepper to      taste. Another popular stuffing consists of 1 cup of      farmer's or cottage cheese mixed with an egg, herbs, and      salt and pepper.    </p>    <p>      If you'd prefer a more traditional flavor, however, try      sauerkraut-drained and chopped-combined with      minced onion, mushrooms, sour cream, and salt and pepper.      Or, if you have lots of time, you can reconstitute dried      black Japanese mushrooms and simmer them with minced onion.      Then add some black bread crumbs to the mushrooms, and stir      in chopped-up hard-boiled egg, sour cream, and seasonings      to taste. (Needless to say, you can experiment with      different meat, vegetable, and cheese combinations in order      to find a few that please your resident gourmets.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE WRAP-UP</strong>    </p>    <p>      After you've placed the filling on the cutout pastry, fold      the dough in half to form a semicircle (or a squarish      little package if you've cut rectangles), then moisten and      crimp the edges to seal them firmly.    </p>    <p>      Now, fill a large kettle with water and place it on high      heat. Once the liquid starts to boil frantically, drop the      pierogi-a few at a time-into the container.      Then, when the little turnovers float to the top (it'll      take one or two minutes), they'll be done. Remove each one      with a slotted spoon and set it aside to drain in a      colander or on a towel.    </p>    <p>      When all of the dumplings are cooked, melt half a cup of      butter in a large, heavy frying pan and sauce the pastries      until they're piping hot. The finished pierogi can then be      adorned with sour cream or yogurt . . . or topped with      browned bread crumbs for an interesting contrast in      textures.    </p>    <p>      Pierogi can be stored in the refrigerator for four or five      days or frozen for up to six months. If you do decide to      freeze the turnovers, though, be sure to remove them from      the boiling water and drain them on a terry (or linen)      towel until they're thoroughly dry. Then package and freeze      the little pieces. When you're ready to serve the stored      delicacies, boil them again until they float, and finish up      with the same butter bath and toppings already described.    </p>    <p>      Once you've learned how to make these dumplings, you'll      find that pierogi are at home almost anywhere on a menu. So      give these versatile little turnovers a chance. Who knows .      . . instead of grimly dishing out a casserole and daring      your diners not to finish it, you may wind up worrying      whether you're going to have enough pierogi for seconds!    </p>
