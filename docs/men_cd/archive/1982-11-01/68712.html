    <p>
                        <p>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us-for      instance -have read Paul's book The Population Bomb)      . . . few people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs      are involved in ecological research (the type that tends to      be published only in technical journals and college texts).      That's why we're pleased to present this regular      semitechnical column by these well-known      authors/ecologists/educators.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Paul and Anne Ehrlich</h5>    <p>      One of the most crucial "public service" functions of      Earth's ecosystems (in the eyes of humanity, at any rate)      is the provision of the fresh water needed for agriculture,      industrial processes, drinking, and other domestic uses . .      . and the amount of the precious liquid that these systems      circulate is truly colossal! Something on the order of      27,000 cubic miles of fresh water fall on our planet's land      surface annually, and about 15,000 of them are subject to      direct evaporation or are returned to the atmosphere      through the action of plants. The other 12,000 cubic miles      flow over and through the land to the ocean, and the cycle      is completed by the winds that carry 12,000 cubic miles of      moisture, evaporated from the oceans, back to the land.    </p>    <p>      The freshwater flow to the oceans amounts to over 2.5      million gallons for every man, woman, and child in the      human population. And as large as the flows of fresh water      are, the stocks are immensely greater. One estimate      suggests that the volume of ground water-that is, the      water in saturated soil or rock formations that supplies      springs and wells-may be about 50 times the annual      surface flow. (In the United States, this would amount to a      volume about four times that of the Great Lakes.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>SO WHERE'S THE SHORTAGE?</strong>    </p>    <p>      How, then, can there possibly be any difficulty in      supplying all the water needs of hu manity? Why do we      continually hear warnings of shortages? And why does the      United Nations strive to call world attention to the      problem of providing people with enough pure water?    </p>    <p>      Well, the answer to such questions has several parts.      First, the freshwater supplies are not distributed evenly      over the continents . . . nor are human needs. Indeed, in      the United States we seem-perversely-to be creating more      and more "need" in areas already short of water.    </p>    <p>      Second, much of the freshwater runoff is not readily      available for human use. For example, considerable water      flows beneath the land surface to the oceans. More      obviously, rivers and streams are subject to      fluctuation-seasonally and from year to year-in      the amount of water they carry. And the water dependably      available to society cannot exceed the flow in a river      during the driest seasons and years.    </p>    <p>      Third, humanity has found an appalling number of ways to      pollute fresh water, to the point that much of the liquid      is no longer healthful or attractive to drink . . . or even      safe to use in agriculture!    </p>    <p>      In this column and in the one that will appear in MOTHER      NO. 79, we'll examine two interrelated aspects of      humanity's water problems: the pollution and exhaustion of      ground water, and the hazards posed by acid rains.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE PROBLEMS RUN DEEP</strong>    </p>    <p>      For most of human history, the high quality of ground-water      supplies was taken for granted . . . indeed, the image of      water gushing from an artesian well has long been used as a      symbol of aqueous purity. Gradually, though, that picture      has lost its beauty. The fact is that in parts of the      Midwest and California, over-use of synthetic nitrogen      fertilizers has already led to nitrate pollution that      seriously affects infants who drink water from wells.    </p>    <p>      'Furthermore, in the Northeast, wells have had to be closed      because salt, spread on the highways as a de-icing agent,      was infiltrating ground water. And all over the nation,      wells have been shut down because of contamination by human      wastes leaking from sewers and defective septic tanks.    </p>    <p>      Even more serious than contamination by "conventional"      substances has been the fouling of ground water with      synthetic or ganic chemicals. This pollution comes from      diverse sources, including the misuse of pesticides. The      vast majority of it, though, is a result of the improper      disposal of some of the more than 50 million tons of      hazardous industrial wastes that America generates      annually.    </p>    <p>      For example, employees of Grumman Aircraft's factory in      Bethpage, Long Island complained, in late 1976, about the      unpleasant taste of the plant's drinking water.      Investigators found that it contained 50 to 200 parts per      billion of a known carcinogen (cancer-causing substance)      called vinyl chloride. They also discovered that the firm      at fault was not Grumman, but the Hooker Chemical      Company-located a mile and a half away-which      had been pumping toxic wastes into the earth for almost 20      years. Because ground water typically moves only a few tens      of feet per year, it had taken nearly two decades for the      poison to reach the Grumman plant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUT FOR AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you probably know, Hooker was also implicated, a year or      two later, in the Love Canal disaster in Niagara Falls, New      York. Following a period of heavy rains, hazardous wastes      from a Hooker dump traveled through ground water into the      basements of nearby homes. Over 80 substances were      identified, including 11 suspected or actual carcinogens.      Worse still, one of the chemicals, dioxin, not only is      capable of causing cancer, but is also our most deadly      synthetic compound . . . being 100 times more lethal than      strychnine.    </p>    <p>      The Love Canal disaster caused the evacuation of hundreds      of families . . . the dropping of local housing values to      zero . . . and a cost to the state and federal governments      (for cleanup, relocation of residents, and associated      expenses) of more than $36 million by May 1980! Hooker is      now being sued by the United States for a $45 million trust      fund, which would be used to guarantee adequate cleanup.      (Ironically, the estimated cost of proper disposal of the      wastes in the first place would have been less than $2      million.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL BOMBS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sadly, the entire United States is dotted with potential      Love Canals: There are, by government count, something on      the order of 50,000 such toxic dumps. And each of them is      an environmental bomb with a delayed-action fuse, since the      toxic "plumes" generated in ground water are slow-moving      ... expensive to detect (numerous wells must be dug) . . .      and virtually impossible to remove. The more we look for      such contamination, though, the more we discover. For      example, in a 1977 study of 50 separate sites, toxic      substances were found to be entering into and moving      through ground water in almost all of them.    </p>    <p>      And as if it weren't bad enough that the nation's ground      water is being irreversibly poisoned, America is rapidly      taking steps to reduce the quantities of ground water      available in many areas, as well. One cause is overpumping,      which can result in the collapse of water-bearing      formations (aquifers) in the earth, reducing their capacity      to hold ground water.    </p>    <p>      Overpumping also can allow seawater to invade aquifers, as      it has in south Florida. And, most spectacularly, the same      practice can cause the land itself to sink as emptying      aquifers collapse. In Winter Park, Florida in May 1981, a      whole city block disappeared into a rapidly developing      "sinkhole" 400 feet across and 125 feet deep. And that was      just one of the eight major land collapses that occurred in      Florida early that year.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps less dramatic but still shocking is the fact that      the city of Houston has dropped a full five feet (making it      more vulnerable to flooding) and Tucson seven feet .. . in      both cases, because the aquifers beneath the city have been      largely pumped out. Even the enormous Ogallala aquifer that      underlies the Great Plains of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma,      Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota is being      drained at a rapid rate. In fact, the depletion is so fast      and obvious that crackpot schemes are being suggested to      pipe water from the already polluted, gradually drying      Mississippi River to replenish the Ogallala!    </p>    <p>      <strong>LONG ISLAND'S LESSON</strong>    </p>    <p>      But pollution and overuse are only two of the three major      ways in which the United States is assaulting its previous      ground ; water supplies. The third form of attack is      through the destruction of the natural ecosystems that      recharge these reserves. The classic example involves the      extensive aquifers underlying Long Island . . . which      depend, for their recharge, on the pinebarren ecosystem      that once covered most of the island. The thin, sandy soil      of the barrens supports a unique population of flora and      fauna, which-in turn-help maintain the soil . .      . and the uncompacted earth allows rainwater to filter      through to the aquifer.    </p>    <p>      However, starting with Levittown in 1947, more and more of      the pine-barren ecosystem has been bulldozed away to make      room for housing developments, freeways, factories, and      other "improvements". As a result, the' recharge area of      Long Island's once pristine supply of ground water has been      progressively reduced. This, in combination with diverse      sources of pollution, may well have doomed Long Island's      only source of potable water.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the phrase "out of sight, out of mind"      applies all too often to ground-water supplies. State and      local governments-up and down the East Coastshould be      forbidding further development of remaining virgin lands .      . . in order to protect recharge areas. But the question of      whether the Long Island lesson will be heeded is, as yet,      unanswered. Even on the island itself, where the      handwriting is on the wall, the forces of development are      still on the march.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT CAN BE DONE?</strong>    </p>    <p>      The short-term solutions to America's ground-water problems      are easy to specify: [1] the strictest control (with strong      enforcement and heavy penalties for violators) of all      localized sources of pollution . . . [2] the institution of      water conservation measures, with special emphasis on      reducing waste in irrigation . . . and [3] the absolute      protection from development of essential recharge areas      (water conservation being just one of the many reasons why      no more virgin lands in the United States should be      destroyed).    </p>    <p>      The long-term solutions are equally obvious. The population      and per capita water consumption of the country must be      reduced to a level where the carrying capacity of the      nation is not-as is the case today-exceeded.      Impractical as this may seem. in an era of "Reagonomics"      and unfettered growthmania, a long-term solution is      essential, because-as will be seen in our next      column-even the strictest application of the      short-term measures probably won't be able to protect our      water indefinitely.    </p>    <p>      Basic sources of information about groundwater pollution      are the annual reports of the Council on Environmental      Quality and the CEQ's 1981 study, Contamination of Ground      Water by Toxic Organic Chemicals. A fine overview of the      Long Island situation can be found in Joyce Egginton's "The      Long Island Lesson" (Audubon magazine, July 1981). The Love      Canal affair is detailed in Michael Brown's excellent      Laying Waste: The Poisoning of America With Toxic Chemicals      (Pantheon, 1979, $3.50). The "public service" functions of      ecosystems are outlined in Chapter 5 of Paul and Anne      Ehrlich's Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the      Extinction of Species (Random House, 1981, $14.95).    </p>    <p>      From January 23 to February 6, 1983 Anne and Paul Ehrlich,      and their friends and colleagues John and Cheryl Holdren,      will join MOTHER for an educational South Pacific Seminar      on the islands of Tahiti, Bora Bora, Rangiroa, and Huahine.
