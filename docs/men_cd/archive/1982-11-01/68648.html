                <p>      <em>If you're interested in personal computers and paid      "homework" ; you should consider . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Mark Jordan    </h5>        <p>      The Age of the Home Computer has burst upon the 1980's with      all the hoopla of a video game arcade. What with the      appropriate shelves in libraries and bookstores groaning      under the continuing influx of new material on the subject      (and publishers are still hard pressed to keep pace with      the rapidly developing technology), plus the increasingly      familiar sight of computer retail stores at shopping      centers everywhere, it apparently won't be long until      home-sized electronic brains-like television sets      before them-become the focal points of living rooms      across North America.    </p>    <p>      Because of the rapidly spreading popularity of these      "mini-minds", a number of subsidiary industries have sprung      up. And one of these new markets presents opportunities for      computer enthusiasts (or people with the potential to      become proficient with the electronic wonders) who have a      yen for program journalism to start freelancing for profit!    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOUGHT-AFTER SOFTWARE</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you probably know, a personal computer has to have a      program to run: Without this software (a term which is      "computerese" for the list of instructions the machine is      supposed to follow), it'd be about as valuable as a stereo      without a record. And although anyone with a "microthinker"      should be able to write problems for it, most folks don't      have the time or the inclination to create their own      software . . . they'd really rather buy what they need from      someone else. So as the price of home units continues to      come down (as is currently the trend), microcomputers are      going to be more accessible to a greater number of      consumers than ever before . . . and the demand for      software just might skyrocket! Already, the need for new      programs far exceeds the available supply.    </p>    <p>      If you've been keeping up with the news, you're probably      aware that people of all ages are currently exploring this      new marketplace. And when you realize that a lot of folks      are getting paid anywhere from $2.00 to $200 apiece for      simple games-and $500 or more for business-related      packages-it's certainly not hard to see why computer      program writing for profit is an attractive field!    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMPETENT COMPUTING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many individuals have likely shied away from creating      programs because they assumed that success was beyond the      reach of anyone except "whiz kids" such as Daniel Bricklin      and Robert Franstan, who-in 1978-pooled $16,000      to found the highly successful software company they called      VisiCalc (it's now referred to as VisiCorp and earns over      $2,000,000 a year!) . . . or the 16-year-old enthusiast in      California who wrote a game program that has brought him      over $100,000 in earnings.    </p>    <p>      However, fear not . . . plenty of hardworking folks have      found that program freelancing is a fine way to supplement      a regular income ... even though the big-money sales may be      few and far between.    </p>    <p>      Take Bob Dallman, for instance . . . a high school physics      teacher from Indiana who first became intrigued with      computers when his school bought four for classroom use.      After only a week of instruction from the hardware      salesperson, Bob sat down and wrote out four simple      programs for student use . . . and before he knew it, he      was hooked! He just couldn't get enough borrowed time at      the school computers to suit his needs, so Dallman went out      and invested $2,200 in a home system for himself.    </p>    <p>      Then, in order to justify his new obsession, Bob submitted      his programs to a software company he saw advertised in a      computer magazine. He figured that-just may      be-he'd be able to sell one or two . . . but instead,      the firm bought them all! And so far (over the course of a      year), the teacher has earned about $750 in royalties, with      more coming in . . . not bad when you consider that he      spent a total of only about 12 hours on writing the four      programs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOR MEN ONLY?</strong>    </p>    <p>      As another example, consider North Carolina's Linda Brown,      who's the wife of an IBM employee and the mother of two      daughters. Since she'd been trained in computer programming      during a previous job in research, it was only natural      that-when the family budget needed      boosting-Linda decided to call upon her      program-writing skill to help out. She purchased an IBM      personal computer . . . and now (just six months later)      she's an avid, wellpaid freelancer, working out of her own      den!    </p>    <p>      Ms. Brown's specialty is creating business packages, which      she prepares for companies (including a leading soft-drink      producer) who commission her to tailor-make programs for      their specific needs. Usually, her payment is agreed upon      beforehand, as is the case with most contracted work. Once      a buyer tells Linda the sort of package required, she      figures up how much time she thinks it'll take to do the      job . . . and quotes a price. If the company is happy with      her estimate, she's off and writing!    </p>    <p>      Although many programmers can command $30 to $50 an hour      for the kind of writing Linda tackles, she's still making a      name for herself in what she feels is a male-dominated      field, and asks only about $20 per hour for her services.      (EDITOR'S NOTE: This is not to imply that most female      programmers offer "bargain" rates. It's merely to point out      that this one woman has found it necessary to undercut the      going fee in order to keep herself in business.) However,      even at that rate, Linda figures she's doing just fine . .      . since preparing an average company package will take      anywhere from three weeks to six months of six-hour days,      working five days a week.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STARTING OUT . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you can see, then, a market for freelancers does exist.      But don't be blinded quite yet by dreams of huge dollar      signs flashing on and off in computer-graphic color! Before      you can be a success at this freelancing business, you've      got to put in some learning time. First off, obviously, you      must have access to a home computer, and your best bet is      to go ahead and buy one if you can afford to. (See the      price information at the end of this article.)    </p>    <p>      But that's only the beginning. Don't assume that you'll be      able to sit down with the instruction book and "talk" to      your new machine immediately. Far from it! The sort of      knowledge required to operate a microcomputer is best      learned through handson experience, gained under the      guidance of a qualified instructor. So find a competent      friend to help . . . or enroll in a course, either at the      store where you purchased your hardware or at a local      college. The few extra dollars that it'll cost you to learn      proper and effective programming will be more than paid      back (in avoided frustration, at the very least) over the      long haul.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAXIMUM MARKETING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you've learned to communicate with your computer, and      after you've run off several practice programs, you can      decide just what sort of software you want to create for      sale. Current programs are generally classified according      to five categories: personal and home . . . games . . .      educational . . . business . . . and graphics. In the      beginning, at least, it's best to select an area that      you're fairly familiar with, and then research the market      before you actually set to work. (After all, there's no      point in creating a program that duplicates one already      available.)    </p>    <p>      When choosing a subject area, though, you might want to      keep in mind that thousands of video games are born every      day, and-unless you're ready to buck some stiff      competition-you're likely better off working up      something other than games . . . a good practical home      budget program, for instance. (Surprisingly enough, there's      still a dearth of this type of software.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>THINK COMPUTERESE!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Since a program is simply a detailed set of instructions      that tell a computer what to do, you must be extremely      careful-when writing one-to document every step      of the instructions . . . in a manual for the potential      computerite, and in either cassette tape or floppy disk      form for the "micromind" it self. Don't skip from Point A      to Point C under the assumption that Point B is too obvious      to mention . . . it may not be equally clear to someone      else. You can be sure that many of your potential customers      will be less proficient than you . . . and the simple      omission of a single procedure could make your entire      program inoperable in the hands of a beginner.    </p>    <p>      There's another factor to consider in choosing your slice      of the software business pie: There is <em>no</em>      universal computer language. Now most programs <em>are</em>      written in some form of BASIC (which is currently the most      commonly used and easy-to-learn computer lingo, although      others are already catching on) . . . but BASIC varies from      one firm's computer to another. For instance, if you write      a program in Apple BASIC, the same program      won't-without some revision-run in a TRS-80 . .      . because even though that TRS-80 computes BASIC, it      computes only TRS-80 BASIC. This fact is unfortunate in      some ways, but it does mean that you can broaden your base      of operations by learning to translate from one sort of      BASIC to another and selling <em>that</em> service as well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ALL DRESSED UP AND NOWHERE TO GO . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      When your program is documented and recorded (it's a good      idea to photocopy a practice printout to show a buyer . . .      as proof that your system <em>works),</em> you're ready to      try to sell the package. And if you keep up-as any      freelance program writer should-with computer      magazines <em>(Personal Computing, Popular Computing,      Byte,</em> and others), you'll probably be able to locate a      lot of software markets by simply perusing the ads in such      periodicals.    </p>    <p>      In fact, you might want to take out an advertisement in one      of these magazines yourself, and try to sell your product      directly to users through the mail. The cost for ad space      varies with the different publications, so be sure to      compare rates.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you do choose to take the mail order route,      you'll be responsible not only for copyrighting your work      (if you decide to attempt to protect it . . . something      fewer and fewer programmers are bothering to do), but also      for making as many copies of the manuals and tapes or disks      as you think you'll need to fill your order. Still, if you      don't mind the small financial risk and the      trouble-and if you're patient and      persistent-selling firsthand (with no middleman      except the post office) could be the way to go.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SECURITY SOFTWARE</strong>    </p>    <p>      If, however, you'd rather not handle individual orders, you      could attempt to market your computerware either to      software companies (new ones are springing up daily) or to      computer manufacturers (they're constantly trying to keep      their hardware customers supplied With new software). Both      of these potential groups of buyers advertise in computer      magazines . . . so leaf through a few issues to find the      names and addresses of companies you might like to deal      with. Then contact the firms to inquire about their rates      and such.    </p>    <p>      It might pay to check with hardware retailers in your area,      too, to see whether they know of anyone who needs a      programmer locally. Many times these stores are clear      inghouses for information of this sort, and the folks who      manage them would probably be more than happy to help you      out. Since they frequently offer classes in programming,      some might even be interested in hiring you as an      instructor! Anyway, it's worth a visit just to let them      know who you are . . . what sort of programming you can do      . . . and how they can get in touch with you if they need      to.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RAINBOW CHASING OR INCOME EARNING?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Whether you decide to sell your wares outright or market      them wholesale through someone else, you're likely to      discover that the Age of Home Computers is rich with      potential for the innovative go-getter. And even if you      <em>don't</em> strike pay dirt by writing programs, you're      sure to have a heck of a lot of fun-and pick up a      good bit of knowledge-exploring the BASIC      possibilities of program journalism!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Here are the approximate starting prices      for some of the more popular models available, as listed in      William Barden, Jr.'s</em> Guidebook to Small Computers      <em>(published by Howard W.
