                <p>      Maybe you can't spin those stalks into gold, but it takes      just a bit of fiddling to play . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by        C. Donald Knight    </h5>    <p>      I think I've discovered the perfect compromise method for      growing tomatoes (and other garden produce) indoors . . . a      Golden Mean between the high-tech effectiveness of      hydroponic cultivation and the simplicity-and lower      cost-of raising plants in soil. I'm talking about      straw-bale culture, a technique I heard of only after      hauling some 300 cubic feet of pumice, gravel, and dirt to      fill the planting beds of my new solar-heated greenhouse.    </p>    <p>      As I paused in the middle of that task to contemplate (and      curse) the necessity of trucking still more earth to my      conservatory, some sympathetic friends came to my rescue      with tales of "soilless" hothouse gardening. Needless to      say, the idea caught my fancy immediately. After all, who      wouldn't exchange the transfer of tons of terra firma for      the lifting of a little straw?    </p>    <p>      Bale culture, as noted above, is similar to hydroponics in      many respects . . . but it does <em>not</em> require the      special equipment or the twice-daily soakings necessary in      many water-growing methods. In fact, plants raised in straw      seem to need even less water than do those rooted in soil.      And unlike the almost inert growing medium of the      hydroponic system, the constantly composting environment of      straw-nurtured plants provides some "bonus" nutrients for      the vegetables . . . as well as a source of gentle heat for      their roots and for the greenhouse.    </p>    <p>      Nor do the advantages of growing vegetables in straw end      there. Tomatoes, in particular, seem to fairly leap at the      chance to form huge nurturing root systems amidst the      stalks .. . and such formations are (within limits) very      productive of healthy plant tops. The composting straw also      produces some CO 2 gas, the presence of which in more than      usual amounts tends to improve the growth rate and general      health of all the vegetation in the greenhouse.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTING OFF THE GROUND</strong>    </p>    <p>      Because a typical straw bale is about 24" wide, I set aside      room-in my conservatory-to accommodate a 2' X      20' bed of the material. After putting down a layer of      plastic sheeting (to help the straw retain water), I simply      set the bales end to end. (You could use loose straw held      in place by barrier walls . . but the unpacked stalks sink      rather drastically in the course of time, displacing the      plants. It's also somewhat difficult to stake tomatoes that      are growing in unbound straw.)    </p>    <p>      After the bales are in place, you'll have to undertake a      three-week period of preparation before setting out your      plants. First, each bale needs to be soaked with a gallon      of water daily for two weeks. (It's also a good idea to      keep the straw covered with plastic sheeting between      waterings.) Once the bundles have been thoroughly drenched      for 14 consecutive days and organic decomposi tion is      underway, you can apply the fertilizer that will nurture      your vegetables.    </p>    <p>      Commercial tomato food (for example) contains everything      necessary for the successful growth of a crop of love      apples . . . providing nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium      represented in a ratio of about 5/10/10. For the initial      fertilization of your straw bed, you'd need about 2-1/2      pounds of such augmentation per bale.    </p>    <p>      In contrast, many hydroponic fertilizers have a      nitrogen/phosphate/potassium ratio of 8/8/22 (they also      supply calcium, manganese, magnesium, cobalt, iron, and      molybdenum). Though I've had no personal experience in      using those products, I'd imagine      that-again-feedings of 2-1/2 pounds per bale      would be suitable . . . though you may want to cut down on      the amount of potassium later- in the growth cycle.      [EDITOR'S NOTE: It's a good idea to check with your local      fertilizer dealer-or county agricultural      agent-before using plant foods in growing mediums      other than those intended by the manufacturer.]    </p>    <p>      If you prefer to mix your own growth inducer, you'll find      blood meal to be an excellent source of nitrogen. It also      has some phosphate content, and more of that substance can      be obtained from rock phosphate. Wood ash will provide      potassium . . . iron is present in the blood meal . . . and      magnesium can be supplied by seaweed or Epsom salts (at a      dosage of one tablespoon per plant). Finally,      well-composted manure is generally an adequate source of      many of the minerals necessary to healthy plant growth.    </p>    <p>      Any good book on gardening will suggest ways to supply your      plants with the essential nutrients. I've found Frank      Allerton's Tomatoes for Everyone (available for $7.50      postpaid from the publisher: Faber & Faber, Dept. TMEN,      39 Thompson Street, Winchester, Massachusetts 01890) to be      an excellent guide to all kinds of productive      tomato-growing methods, including strawbale culture.    </p>    <p>      Whatever fertilizer you use, first spread      it-dry-on top of the straw, then water the bed      daily for about a week (use a gallon per bale). If the      growing medium is too densely packed or the plant food      seems insoluble, you can work it into the tightly bound      bundle with a trowel.    </p>    <p>      The introduction of the fertilizer will rapidly increase      the rate of bacterial action in the decomposing straw,      raising the bed's internal heat. An effort should be made      to retain this warmth (by continuing to cover the planting      medium with plastic) to aid in the generation of the      nutrients needed for plant growth.    </p>    <p>      During the period of intense composting, any seeds in the      straw are likely to sprout. It's possible that the heat of      decomposition will kill the shoots . . . if not, you'll      want to weed them out prior to transplanting your tomato      seedlings.    </p>    <p>      Within a week following fertilization, the temperature in      the interior of the bales will have begun to subside. Once      it drops below 100Â°F, you'll be      able-finally-to plant your crop. (If you don't      have an appropriate thermometer for monitoring the internal      temperature of the straw, just push a stick into the      bedding and leave it there for an hour. If the wood is only      slightly warm to the touch when you withdraw it, you're      ready to bring on the plants!)    </p>    <p>      <strong>SWING YOUR PLANTER</strong>    </p>        <p>      While I'd imagine you could grow just about any variety of      tomato in a composted straw bed, I've had very good luck      with Tuckcross 520 . . . which was developed specifically      for greenhouse cultivation. I've also achieved excellent      yields from such standbys as Marglobe, Rutgers, and Red      Cherry. In short, straw-bale culture seems to reward the      gardener on a fairly consistent basis, regardless of the      kind of plant raised . . . as long as each seedling's      feeding requirements are recognized.    </p>    <p>      You'll get the best results from your straw bed by      transplanting tomatoes that are six to eight weeks old.      Allow five plants for every two bales. To hold each      young'un in place and give it a start, set a 4"- to      6"-high, 6"-diameter ring of cardboard or metal (a      one-pound coffee tin with both ends removed works well)      directly on top of the bedding . . . fill the cylinder with      compost or soil . . . and plant one of your infant tomatoes      in it.    </p>    <p>      This is also the best time to stake the young plants. The      job will be easy if you're using bales . . . but if you've      opted for loose straw, it'll be necessary to devise a      supporting frame.    </p>    <p>      As the seedlings begin to sink their roots into the      fertilizer-enriched straw, they'll rapidly use up the      nutrients. Therefore, approximately two weeks after      planting-and every other week thereafter-you      should replenish the beds with about one-quarter of the      amount of nitrogen fertilizer you used in the first      feeding. On alternate weeks, refortify the potassium      content of the straw with onequarter of the dosage      initially spread on the bales . . . and always keep a sharp      eye out for signs of nutrient deficiencies.    </p>    <p>      I've occasionally varied my feeding routine by serving each      tomato a gallon of manure tea. And I've also tried a      solution of water and fish emulsion ... a mixture which had      the unexpected and pleasant side effect of filling my      inland greenhouse with the faint but unmistakable aroma of      the sea.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE JOY OF STRAW-BURYING</strong>    </p>        <p>      Aside from their need for regular nutritional supplements,      tomatoes planted in straw are cared for pretty much as more      traditionally cultivated crops would be. Soon after my      initial planting, I was able to harvest succulent red      fruit, and I did so for months before the plants began to      give out. Of course, there are a few things to be      considered prior to opting for the bundled stalk method . .      . including the cost of the straw itself, fertilizer      prices, and the possibility of plant burnout if you      overfeed your tomatoes (or of the production of giant      stalks with more leaves than fruit if you overdo the      nitrogen).    </p>    <p>      All things considered, though, I'm convinced that      straw-bale culture's advantages far outweigh any drawbacks.      In fact, I plan to use the method with other crops, and try      it for outdoor planting as well. Meanwhile, I believe I've      discovered an important secret: When it comes to growing      tomatoes in a greenhouse, straw-the Golden      Mean-is the happy medium!    </p>
