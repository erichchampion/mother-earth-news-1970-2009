    <p>
                        <p>      Helen and Scott Nearing are light-years ahead of most of us      when it comes to living a life of voluntary simplicity in      harmony with nature. Back in 1932 they began homesteading a      run-down farm in Vermont's Green Mountains, and      later-when the slopes around them exploded into ski      resorts in the early 50's-Helen and Scott moved to a      rocky inlet on the Maine coast . . . and started all over      again.    </p>    <p>      That's where you'll find the Nearings today: They're still      clearing brush, still building the stone structures they're      famous for, and still raising most of their vegetarian diet      themselves in productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for 50 years.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, the Nearings have learned a good deal about      homesteading over the years . . . and they've agreed to      share that knowledge with MOTHER's readers in a regular      question-and-answer column. Send your queries about      self-reliant living on the land to Helen and Scott Nearing,      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , 105 Stoney Mountain Road,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791. Please don't expect      personal replies, though. The most frequently asked      questions will be answered here-and here      only-so that we can all benefit from what the      Nearings have to offer.    </p>    <p>      With cold weather upon us, my husband and I were wondering      what the best way to "put the garden to bed" might be.      Could you please outline the methods you use each autumn to      prepare your growing plot for the following spring?    </p>    <p>      <strong>After the last harvest is in, we weed our entire      garden and cultivate it thoroughly. Once we're certain that      frost has killed or driven away any nesting slugs, we mulch      the plot . . . using hay, autumn leaves, or seaweed.      (Mulching too early will give the slugs a warm home in      which to survive the season.) At this time we also put a      blanket of loose mulch over the hardy plants (such as kale,      brussels sprouts, leeks, or parsley) to help them winter      over.</strong>    </p>    <p>      My husband and I have long dreamed of starting an organic      truck farm on our 12 acres of tired Florida land . . . but      we're at a loss as to how to begin. Although there's an      abundance of information about raising organically grown      vegetables on a small garden plot, you see, there seems to      be precious little practical advice available on how to      start, run, and make a comfortable living from a larger      enterprise. And-as we expected-local farmers      assure us that eking out a family income from a "giant      garden" is impossible . . . especially if we rely upon      organic methods. Surely, though, there are other folks      who-like us-would love to try a small-scale      version of the family farm, but who are afraid to go ahead      without a solid information base.    </p>    <p>      We're accustomed to the hard work that's required to build      up the soil, and are willing to cut our expenditures to the      bare minimum in order to reach our goal. Do you think we      have a chance? What literature can you suggest to help      guide us?    </p>    <p>      <strong>With 12 acres of Florida property at your disposal,      it sounds as if you have a splendid opportunity to      experiment with potentially profitable year-round growing      ventures. We suggest starting with a small cultivated plot,      however . . . you can enlarge your enterprise as you      learn.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>As far as appropriate literature is concerned,      there are a number of helpful gardening and small-scale      farming books put out by Garden Way Publishing Co. (Dept.      TMEN, Charlotte, Vermont 05445) and Rodale Press, Inc.      (Dept. TMEN, 33 East Minor Street, Emmaus, Pennsylvania      18049). Two of our books-Living</strong> <strong>the      Good Life and Continuing the Good Life-discuss      self-reliant farming.</strong>    </p>    <p>      We moved back to the land several years ago . . . and now      we wouldn't trade our country lifestyle for the rushed pace      of the city under any circumstance. However, my wife and I      are still occasionally questioned by incredulous urban      dwellers as to how we can stand to "live out in the sticks      and away from all civilization".    </p>    <p>      Do you know of any writings that would help me      explain-in simple terms-the joys of living off the      land?    </p>    <p>      <strong>The following quotation (which is included in      Helen's book</strong> <strong>Wise Words on the Good Life)      perhaps expresses your feelings best:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>"When the sun rises, I go to work,<br />      When the sun goes down, I take my rest,<br />      I dig the well from which I drink,<br />      I farm the soil that yields my food,<br />      I share creation. Kings can do no more."</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ancient Chinese 2500 B.C.</strong>    </p>    <p>      You often extol the virtues of eating a diet consisting      primarily of raw foods . . . and I was wondering how you're      able to accomplish this goal during the winter months when      your garden is no longer producing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>We have a homemade greenhouse that furnishes us      with delicious greens year round. Our winter menus are      supplemented by carrots, beets, rutabagas, turnips,      potatoes, onions, and apples-all from our garden-which we      store in bins in the cellar and consume until the new crops      come in.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Here's a tasty winter salad, talon from Helen's      cookbook,</strong> <strong>Simple Food for the Good      Life:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>1/2 head of lettuce or cabbage, finely      chopped<br />      4 stalks of celery, chopped<br />      1 green pepper, chopped<br />      3 apples, chopped<br />      4 tablespoons of oil<br />      2 tablespoons of vinegar<br />      a handful of nuts</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Combine the vegetables and apples with the nuts.      Then add the oil and vinegar, toss the salad to coat the      ingredients thoroughly, and enjoy!</strong>    </p>    <p>      It would be helpful to me if you'd devote some space to a      description of your home . . , including its size, how it's      heated and plumbed, and how long it took to build.    </p>    <p>      <strong>We've written a new book,</strong> <strong>Building      With Stone in Our 70's and 90's, which describes-with      over 200 photographs-the construction of our latest      stone house. While we wait for publication, here's a      preview:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We cleared the land and built roads into our      property some ten years ago. The next year we constructed a      stone outhouse and a garage/workshop/storage      building-complete with a flagstone floor-of      rock and hand-hewn timbers.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>During the following three summers, we put up the      35' X 53' two-story house . . . the back half of the      structure has a cellar underneath the kitchen and the      pantry, and includes a bathroom with a Clivus Multrum      composting toilet. For cooking (and some heating) we use an      old King Kineo stove. The front portion of the house has a      pine-paneled, flagstone-floored study and living room with      a fireplace, and we use a "Free Flow" woodstove in winter      for heating.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Upstairs there are two bedrooms-also paneled      in pine-each with a balcony. One room faces east and      overlooks the garden, while the other faces west and has a      view of Penobscot Bay.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We have running water in the kitchen and bathroom      (Helen dowsed and found sparkling clear water 74 feet      down!).</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>In 1977 we finally moved into our new house, and      set to work building a stone wall around the garden and      adding a solar greenhouse. The whole operation of clearing      the site, building, and settling in took a long time ...      however, we've never hurried with our construction or      gardening projects. Instead, we've always been willing to      take the time to do it right. As a result, we now have the      house we want and can sincerely say that we enjoyed every      minute of our work!</strong>    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The Nearings will be glad to mail a price      list far their books to anyone who sends a self-addressed,      stamped envelope to the Social Science Institute, Dept.
