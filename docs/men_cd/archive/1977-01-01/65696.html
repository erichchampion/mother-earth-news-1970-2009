                         <p>      Thanks to Judy Helsinger (one of Bantam Books' dynamite      publicity people), Geraldo Rivera (yes ladies, the Geraldo      Rivera) and an ABC-TV film crew recently visited MOTHER's      facilities down here in the mountains of western North      Carolina. During the course of that visit, Geraldo had a      chance to see and report on some of the experiments in      self-sufficient living that we always seem to be working      with.    </p>    <p>      Among the other things that Geraldo inspected "down on      MOTHER's farm", were a methane-powered car, a 2-kw      windplant and bank of storage batteries and the      all-electric house that they light and partially power, a      variety of solar cookers, MOTHER's solar-heated editorial      offices, and a 4' X 4' X 4' sprouting cabinet loaded with      growing shoots of alfalfa, lentils, wheat, and oats.    </p>    <p>      The footage of all this activity was scheduled for      nationwide showing on ABC's Good Morning America program .      . . but, unfortunately, it'll probably already have been      aired by the time you receive this issue of our magazine.      Sorry if you missed it . . . but THANKS Geraldo and ABC and      Judy Helsinger for helping us carry MOTHER's word to folks      who wouldn't otherwise have seen it.    </p>
