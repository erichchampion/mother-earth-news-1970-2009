             		       <p>      <strong>Ever wonder who writes the messages that appear in      greeting cards? Well, Carol</strong> <strong>Eannarino? a      freelance writer from New York City-is here to tell      you how . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      Step inside a drugstore or gift shop and take a look at all      the greeting cards. Obviously, there's money in the card      business . . . and whoever writes the verses and gags that      appear on these preprinted missives must be getting a piece      of the action. But who are those people? And how did they      "break into" card-writing?    </p>    <p>      Well, as I've long since learned, most greeting card      publishers rely on freelancers to supply most of their      ideas . . . and the only qualifications needed to become      one of those freelancers are [1] imagination and [2] a      sense of humor. When I found out how good the pay was, I      immediately decided that I met both requirements. Quite      possibly you do, too.		</p>		<h3>SOME SPECIFICS</h3>        <p>      Please let me qualify that statement about the "good pay"      just a bit. I don't know anyone who's become rich-or      even comfortably well-to-do?as a freelance greeting card      writer. (The money's not that good.) Still, the constant      flurry of $10, $15, and $25 checks you're likely to receive      as a part-time card poet can pay the rent (and then some),      if you're able to churn out fresh ideas regularly.    </p>    <p>      The best money is in studios (those long, slim cards that      pack a humorous hello). Originally, the studios were aimed      at a somewhat sophisticated audience, meaning that quite      often the greetings were rather risque. Nowadays, only a      few companies actually solicit bawdy gags . . . the rest?if      they use such material at all?want it to be subtle and "in      good taste".    </p>    <p>      There are studio cards for all occasions: birthdays,      friendship (almost anything goes here), get well,      anniversary, holiday greetings, etc. Some publishers read      seasonal (holiday) ideas year round . . . others have a      definite schedule. You can write to the various companies      to learn their requirements (see the sidebar that      accompanies this article).    </p>    <p>      Although most card firms pay around $25 for a studio idea,      the rate of remuneration varies. Really big      outfits-like Hallmark?can afford to (and do) fork      over $50 or more, while smaller companies pay as low as      $10.    </p>    <p>      Another type of greeting?similar to the studio, but a bit      smaller in size and more overt in its humor?is the humorous      card. (Note: There's also a cute card, which is softer and      more feminine in its approach than either the studio or the      humorous.) Sometimes, an editor at a large company may      decide that your studio idea would be better as a humorous,      in which case you'll probably be paid less. Frankly, I      don't care how my ideas are classified as long as the      checks keep rolling in.    </p>    <p>      Then there are the sentimental cards (you know, those      syrupy?sweet things your grandmother sends on your      birthday). Here, editors are looking for four-, six-, or      eight-liners with rhyme and meter . . . and the end result      must be believable. (There are people who?whether they      believe their rhymes or not?simply can't write this kind of      card, try as they may. I happen to belong to that group      myself.)    </p>    <p>      The pay for sentimental verse is not so good . . . about      $1.00 per line. But again, it varies.    </p>		<h3>HOW TO "SLANT" YOUR WRITING</h3>    <p>      If you think you'd like to try your hand at this unique      craft, start by studying the cards at your local drugstore      or gift shop. <em>These cards are your competition . . . so      learn all you can from them.</em>    </p>    <p>      You'll notice that the most effective cards?regardless of      what category they fall into?have a strong "me to you" or      "us to you" message. (This is partly because many      people?myself included-use greeting cards as      substitutes for letters.) You should strive, then, to give      your ideas what card publishers like to call      <em>sendability</em> . If your gags (or verses) lack this      quality, editors won't buy them no matter how funny (or      sentimental) they are.    </p>    <p>      Along the same lines, try to avoid the "direct slam" type      of greeting, in which the card's recipient is made the butt      of the joke. The majority of card buyers are female and are      likely to be turned off by insults (and other similarly      aggressive ideas). Keep your jabs gentle and good-natured.    </p>    <p>      Bear in mind, too, that many cards are sent by couples. Try      to avoid the I-me-my pronouns, if possible, and focus on      the card's intended receiver (the "you" in your messages).    </p>    <p>      Above all, remember that greeting card editors are experts      in their field. Nothing will turn them off faster than      hackneyed, stale ideas. (Forget the "knock-knock . . .      who's there?" gags.) And don't try "lifting" lines from one      company's cards and selling them to another firm. These men      and women read hundreds?perhaps thousands?of ideas every      week, and can spot a "steal" a mile off.    </p>    <p>      All an editor really wants is a fresh, funny gag with a      surprising punch line and a definite "me to you" feel.      That's what today's greeting cards are all about.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO "BREAK IN" THE PROFESSIONAL WAY</h3>    <p>      In this business, as in any other, professionalism counts,      and here's how to prepare your submissions as a pro would:    </p>    <p>      Most editors prefer that you type your ideas on 3 X 5 file      cards, with your name and address?and a code number for      each idea?on the front of the card. A sample studio      submission is shown in Fig. 1.    </p>    <p>      For ideas that require artwork, you'll need to submit      dummies. To make a dummy, all you have to do is [1] fold a      long, stiff piece of paper over once to resemble a studio      card, [2] type or print the gag lines on the front and the      inside, [3] draw sketches as appropriate (you don't have to      be a Chagall . . . stick figures will do), and [4] put your      name and address-and a code number?on the back of the      card. The card company's art department will take it from      there.    </p>    <p>      Send your cards and/or dummies in batches of 10 to 15, and      <em>always</em> include a self-addressed, stamped envelope      (SASE). Don't bother with a cover letter, because there's      nothing you can say.    </p>    <p>      And do be sure to keep accurate records of when and where      you've sent each of your ideas. You may want to do this by      making duplicates of all your 3 X 5 cards and writing the      relevant routing information on the back of each one. I      prefer to retype the gags from each outgoing batch onto a      single sheet of paper along with their code numbers, the      name of the company to which the batch was sent, and the      date of mailing. (I keep a running tally of the code      numbers I've used on a separate file card.)    </p>    <p>      Once you send out your first batch of ideas, you'll see how      simple all this is . . . and you just may get hooked on      greeting card writing for good!    </p>    <h3>REJECTIONS . . . AND HOW TO HANDLE      'EM</h3>    <p>      OK. You've come up with a raucously funny batch of studio      ideas that you're sure will sell. So?with visions of      ten-dollar checks dancing in your head?you send the gags      off . . . only to receive the whole lot back a week or so      later. (Greeting card editors are usually very prompt.)      With them, there may be a form letter explaining "with      regret" that your cards have no place in the company's      current line. Then again, there may be no explanation at      all.    </p>    <p>      Don't despair. <em>Everybody</em> gets rejections in this      business . . . bushel baskets of 'em. What you should do is      reread your ideas and try to examine them objectively. Can      they be improved in some way? If so, sit down and revise      the gags. Otherwise?if they still sound good to      you?immediately send the ideas to another company. And if      that company rejects them, keep on making the rounds.      (After all, one editor's idea of humor may differ from      another's.)    </p>    <p>      Sometimes an editor will reject your gags or verses for      reasons that have nothing to do with their merit. If you're      lucky, the editor will?in such a case?scribble a note to      that effect on your rejection slip (it's been known to      happen). He/she may tell you for example?that the company      is overstocked with birthday and friendship ideas at this      time, but is short on get?well material. That's what's      known as encouragement. If you don't follow up on it?and      quickly?you're making a big mistake!    </p>     <h3>ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE</h3>        <p>      Once you get the greeting card bug, you'll begin to see      potential card ideas everywhere you look. So be sure to      have a pad and pencil handy at all times . . . especially      bedtime. (The best ideas always seem to come just as I'm      starting to doze off!) With a little practice, you'll soon      be able to conjure up dozens of gags and verses per week,      while you're doing ordinary household or other chores.    </p>    <p>      Who knows? Someday you may be able to use those checks from      Amberley, Barker, Hallmark, Happy Thoughts, and all the      rest to pay the rent (or pay off the mortgage on a small      farm). Anything', possible in the greeting card business!    </p>    <h3>HELP FOR THE GREETING CARD BARD</h3>    <p>      No freelance greeting card writer should be without a copy      of the latest edition of Writer's Market, published      annually by the staff of Writer's Digest. One chapter of      this mammoth reference book is devoted to greeting card      markets and contains the names, addresses, editorial      requirements, and rates of payment of over two dozen      companies in this field. You can purchase Writer's Market      for $13.50 (plus shipping) from Mother's Bookshelf, or      direct from Writer's Digest at 9933 Alliance Rd.,      Cincinnati, Ohio 45242. (Or you can go to the library and      make Xerox copies of the book's relevant pages.)    </p>    <p>      If you're unable to find Writer's Market, send 50 cents?and      a self?addressed, stamped envelope?to The National      Association of Greeting Card Publishers, 170 Mason St.,      Greenwich, Conn. 06830, and ask for a copy of their      freelance market list.    </p>    <p>      Also, since editors frequently change jobs or revise their      requirements, it pays to keep in touch with the individual      greeting card companies. Many of these firms publish a      monthly listing of requirements, and those that don't will      more than likely be happy to tell you their current needs.      (Again, though, don't forget to enclose a SASE.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, you'll occasionally find market news and,      sometimes, articles on the craft of greeting card      writing?in the monthly news-stand magazines, <em>The      Writer</em> and <em>Writer's Digest-Carol      Eannarino.</em>    </p>
