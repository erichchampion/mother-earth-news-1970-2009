                        <p>      The spiny yucca plant-used for centuries as a staple      food by Indians of the southwestern U.S.?may offer hope for      the 20 million Americans who suffer from some form of      arthritis. At least, that seems to be the bottom line of a      study conducted by California physicians Robert Bingham and      Bernard A. Bellew (and reported in The Journal of Applied      Nutrition, Vol. 27, No. 2).    </p>    <p>      In the Bingham-Bellew study, 165 arthritis victims?aged 11      to 92?were given from two to eight yucca extract tablets      per day for up to five months. (A control group of 51      patients received placebos, or non?medicinal tablets. None      of the patients who participated in the study knew which      kind of pills?yucca or placebo-he/she was receiving.)    </p>    <p>      The results: 49% of the patients who'd taken yucca tablets      felt that the pills had had an overall beneficial effect on      their symptoms. By contrast, only 21% of the patients who      got placebos reported any improvement in their condition.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps more strikingly, 60% of all patients receiving      yucca extract said that they felt less swelling, pain, and      stiffness after trying the pills. And more than 90% of      these people-when asked?said that they'd noticed no      unpleasant effects stemming from their "yucca therapy".    </p>    <p>      Dr. Bingham?who has treated well over 1,000 patients with      yucca pills during the past two years?says that persons who      suffer gastrointestinal disturbances with their arthritis      seem to derive the greatest benefit from yucca therapy. He      adds: "The pills seem to be useful also in treating some      patients who have had chronic headaches in connection with      joint discomfort."    </p>    <p>      How does yucca extract act to alleviate some of the      symptoms of arthritis? No one knows. In fact, there's no      reason why yucca saponin (the substance of which the yucca      pills are made) should <em>exert</em> any direct effect on      the human body, since it's not absorbed into the      bloodstream. Drs. Bingham and Bellew, however, suggest that      the substance probably brings about relief      <em>indirectly,</em> by reducing (or otherwise altering)      the production of toxins in the intestinal tract.    </p>    <p>      The two California physicians make no claims that yucca      pills can "cure" arthritis . . . nor do they say that most      people who try the tablets can expect relief from arthritis      symptoms. (This is only reasonable. There are more than a      hundred forms of the disease we call "arthritis", and it'd      be unrealistic?to say the least?to think that any single      medicine could produce a panacea-like cure for the      condition.)    </p>    <p>      One thing's certain: It can't <em>hurt</em> a person to      <em>try</em> yucca tablets. According to Dr. Bingham,      there's virtually no danger of allergic reactions (or      conflicts between yucca and other medications) arising,      since the pills' main ingredient is never actually absorbed      into the body.    </p>    <p>      More research will, of course, be needed before anyone      knows for sure just hour valuable a medicine yucca saponin      is. For now, suffice it to say that the substance has?at      least in some cases?proven effective as an arthritis remedy      . . . and that the desert yucca-valued by Indian cultures      for many centuries-may soon prove just as useful to modern      medical science.    </p>
