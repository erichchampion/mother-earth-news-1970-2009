              		               <p>      There are domes, and there are domes . . . and then there      are the bolt-together <em>cardboard</em> domes sold by      Steve Elias of San Rafael, California.    </p>    <p>      Steve's line of compact (14' across), lightweight (300      pounds) geodesic modules-which have recently      undergone A.I.D. (Agency for International Development)      field tests in Guatemala-combine an impressive array      of virtues:    </p>    <p>      [1] Low cost. (Steve sells kits for $400 each . . . little      more than you'd pay for a comparably sized tent.)    </p>    <p>      [2] Ease of construction. According to the kit's designer,      three unskilled people can build a dome like the one shown      here in three hours (and seal it with caulking compound in      another hour) using nothing but a screwdriver, tile knife,      wrench, caulking gun, and clamps.    </p>    <p>      [3] Durability. Says Steve: "What I'm using is NOT ordinary      cardboard. It's a double-layer, corrugated fiberboard      bonded together with waterproof resin and      impregnated-not coated-with polywax. Believe      me, it's tough!"    </p>    <p>      [4] Livability. "I've been living very comfortably in one      of these 160-square-foot units in my backyard for nearly a      year," claims Steve. "I've got lights, an Aladdin heater, a      telephone, and all the furnishings-bed, desk,      bookcase, wall hangings, etc.-of a regular bedroom."    </p>    <p>      [5] Versatility. Two or more modules can easily be linked      together to create a "dome-house" with separate toilet,      sleeping, and kitchen facilities. (Steve has even stacked      domes!) Conceivably, a dozen or more units could be joined      to form semi-permanent quarters for intentional      communities, day schools, and so on.    </p>    <p>      Although his newly formed company is primarily engaged in      research and development (rather than sales) activities at      this time, Steve Elias says he'll gladly mail a slick fact-      and photo-filled descriptive brochure to anyone who sends      him a $2.00 contribution.
