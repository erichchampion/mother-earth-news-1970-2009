        <h3>CARLA EMERY</h3><p>"The School of Country Living is in its annual period of bankruptcy," the lady explains, half smiling. For someone who's just lost two years of hard work and $100,000+ in a mudslide, this author/ mother/educator seems unusually buoyant. But then, that's CARLA EMERY for you.</p><p>The bankruptcy of which Carla speaks has a long history behind it. In fact, the story really goes back to the summer of 1970, when Ms. Emery first conceived of-and began to advertise-her now-legendary <em>Old Fashioned Recipe Book.</em></p><p>The <em>Recipe Book</em> -a mammoth collection of information on how to grow, cook, preserve, and serve hundreds of foods and beverages-took three and a half years to write, and made publishing history soon after its appearance in March of 1974. (The <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> lists Carla's five-pound manual as the largest mimeographed volume in general circulation, and also cites Carla for having sold more copies-45,000 to date-of a self-published guide than anyone in history.)</p><p>Two years ago, Carla and her husband, Michael, could easily have retired on the proceeds from their super-cookbook ... but they didn't. Instead, the couple used their earnings to open (in June 19751 the School of Country Living in Kendrick, Idaho . . . a place where people of all ages and backgrounds could come to learn farming, cooking, construction, and other skills.</p><p>From the beginning, the School operated at a loss. (It had to. State requirements effectively prohibited Carla from charging tuition.) Then, about a year ago, Bantam Books paid Carla $115,000 for publishing rights to her <em>Recipe Book</em>. . . and-for once-things were (financially speaking) looking up for the School.</p><p>All that has changed, however. For on August 2, 1976, the School of Country Living was hit by a giant mudslide . . . a disaster which left over a hundred animals dead and the School's buildings destroyed.</p><p>When asked if the School (which is now $0,000 in debt! would ever be revived, Carla told MOTHER: "It may never rise again. I can't predict that I can go on making the kind of money that's needed to keep the School open. All I can say, at this point, is that I've learned a pretty good lesson in reality."</p><p><em>(The new 7th Edition of Carla's</em><em>Old Fashioned Recipe Book-a 900-page treasury of recipes, tips, and country lore-is available for $15, plus $2.00 postage/handling, from Carla Emery, Kendrick Idaho 83537.-THE EDITORS.)</em></p><h3>FRANCES SHERIDAN GOULART</h3><p>Permanent-pressed doggie burgers and canned horsemeat may not be on the way out yet .. . but they would be if FRANCES SHERIDAN GOULART-health food expert and wife of science fiction writer Ron Goulart-had anything to say about it.</p><p>The 85-pound Wilton, Connecticut cookbook author claims that dogs and cats-like their human guardians-regularly consume 10 to 12% more protein than their bodies can efficiently utilize ... to say nothing of the artificial food colorings and preservatives in pet chows. Which is why Ms. Goulart has written <em>Bone Appetit:. Natural Fools for Pets</em> ($2.50 from Pacific Search, 715 Harrison St., Seattle, Wash. 981091.</p><p>According to author/lecturer/distance-runner Goulart-whose previous book credits include Macmillan's . <em>The</em><em>Ecological Eclair</em> and Chathams <em>Bum Steers</em> -there's already considerable nationwide interest in natural foods for pets. "When I gave a workshop on cooking for one's pet at a natural foods convention," she says, "I had a full house!"</p><h3>DR. WES JACKSON</h3><p>Some "authorities" like to expound at length an environmental problems with out changing their own lifestyles at all . . . while other folks change their ways of living without writing or talking about the switch.</p><p>Somewhere between these two extremes is WES JACKSON, the soft-spoken geneticist-author of Man and the Environment (Win. C. Brown Co., 1971), who-last summer-abandoned his job as professor of environmental studies at the California State University :in Sacramento to start his own school on a 28-acre farm near Salina, Kansas.</p><p>Wes's "school" is called The Land Institute, and is-in his own words-devoted to "a search for alternatives: in agriculture, shelter, energy, and waste disposal".</p><p>Dr. Jackson-aided by his wife, Dana presently teaches a 15-week exploratory course in alternatives, for which eight students (who come from colleges all around the country! pay $462.50 in tuition. Students read papers and books, attend morning discussions, and work on individual projects. (Two girls are reconstructing a nearby Indian house, two more pupils are designing and building a solar water heater, and another is constructing a dwelling made of newspaper, wire, and poured concrete.)</p><p>Dr. Jackson says that he intends from time to time-to have outside lecturers come and speak to his students. He has already arranged for Dr. E.F. Schumacher-world-famous author of Small Is Beautiful and subject of the Plowboy Interview in MOTHER NO. 42-to visit the Institute in March.</p><p>"To put it simply," Dr. Jackson state, "our experiment-our 'course"-is an attempt to develop, and live by, a wholistic philosophy . . . one that enables us to live in harmony with nature. To this end, we're ready to try anything."</p><p>Anyone 18 years of age or older may apply for enrollment at The Land Institute. The dace to write: Wes Jackson, c/o The Land, Rt. 3, Salina, Kan. 67401.</p><p><em>Are you up on the latest doings of someone</em><em>(such as any of the innovative pioneers featured in MOTHERS Plowboy Interview.) who's achieved recognition in a field regularly covered ht, this magazine.''
