                       <p>      <strong>NEW TYPE OF SOLAR COLLECTOR: THE SALT GRADIENT      POND.</strong> Engineers at the Ohio Agricultural Research      and Development Center in Wooster have built a 12'-deep      plastic-lined pond that can be heated by the sun to      <em>near-boiling temperatures.</em> The trick? The body of      water employs a <em>salt gradient</em> (zero percent salt      concentration at the surface to 20%o at the bottom)      that-in effecteliminates heat loss due to convection.      OARDC workers claim their 28' X 60' pool of brine can store      enough solar energy to meet all the winter heating      requirements of a 2,000-square-foot Ohio home.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LOOKING FOR INEXPENSIVE LAND?</strong> Try Pecos      Valley, Texas, where farm prices have recently plunged to      $100 per acre. Until not long ago, valley cotton farmers      paid only 34c per thousand cubic feet for natural gas (the      fuel used to drive the area's forced irrigation pumps).      Then, when a 10-year contract with Delhi Gas Pipeline Co.      expired on December 31, 1975, natural gas prices soared to      $1.85and higherper thousand cubic feet. And that is now      driving farmers in the area right out of business. "Our      situation is not unique," says local county extension agent      Dan E. Gary. "It's going to happen everywhere . . . Arizona      and California next."    </p>    <p>      <strong>U.S. ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IS RETURNING TO      PRE-1973 GROWTH RATES</strong> more quickly than had been      anticipated by utility companies. Government and industry      statistics point to a 1976 growth rate of nearly 6% . . , a      sharp rise from the zero increase in demand experienced in      1974. The result may be occasional power shortages in some      areas. Says Chauncey Starr, president of the Electric Power      Research Institute: "We're headed for energy malnutrition."    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BUY WISE GUIDE TO SOLAR HEAT</strong> is an      all-new, 124-page manual designed to help the lay person      choose the optimum solar heating/cooling system for his or      her home. The 8-1/2" X 10-1/2" handbook contains      easy-to-understand discussions of various types of solar      systems (and their advantages/drawbacks), and features      sections on air conditioning, cost calculations, and how to      go about obtaining a home improvement loan for solar      installations. The Guide is available for $9.00 from the      Arlor Co., P.O. Box 419, Scituate, Mass. 02066.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RADIOACTIVE "FALLOUT" FOUND DOWNWIND OF NUCLEAR      PLANT.</strong> Land slated for residential development      three miles from the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant in      Colorado' has been found to be covered with dust containing      <em>80 times</em> the state's maximum allowable level of      plutonium. The "fallout" is believed to have drifted      downwind from the weapons facility following a series of      (presumably unpublicized) accidents.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ERA OF THE SOLAR SHAVE IS AT HAND.</strong>      According to a report in <em>Solar Energy Digest</em>      ($28.50/yr. from P.O. Box 17776, San Diego, Calif. 92117),      Norelco will market a solar-powered shaver later this year.      The unit is said to be powered by batteries that require      only 24 hours' exposure to sunshine (or to a 100-watt bulb)      to absorb sufficient energy for three weeks of cordless      shaving. Projected price: $100.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ERDA WILL STUDY THE EFFECTS OF HIGH-STRENGTH      ELECTRIC FIELDS ON ANIMALS.</strong> The agency wants to      know what health hazards-if anywill accompany a      proposed increase in cross-country electrical transmission      line voltage. The increase (from 138,000 to 1,200,000      volts), according to the Energy Research and Development      Administration, would help utilities meet future electric      power demands and improve transmission efficiency. Battelle      Memorial Institute's Pacific Northwest Laboratories will      receive 91.2 million for the study.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WILL WINDPLANTS INTERFERE WITH TV      RECEPTION?</strong> One man thinks so. Thomas B.A.      Seniorprofessor of mechanical engineering at the University      of Michiganbelieves that the presence of a multitude of      wind generators in a community would cause significant      interference with TV signals, the same as a low-flying      aircraft does (except that the windplant phenomenon won't      go away in a few minutes). Senior will study the problem      with the aid of $112,000 in ERDA grant money.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOLKS WHO WANT TO KEEP UP WITH SOLAR ENERGY      NEWS,</strong> patents, and publications will find $8.00      for a year's subscription to <em>Solar Utilization      News</em> the 24-page monthly journal of the recently      founded Alternate Energy Instituteto be money well spent.      Write: SUN, c/o The Alternate Energy Institute, P.O. Box      3100, Estes Park, Colo. 80517.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STILL NO SERI:</strong> The long-awaited      announcement of where the government's Solar Energy      Research Institute will be located has been delayed again,      this time until March . . . . Philco-Ford's <strong>COLD      GUARD REFRIGERATOR</strong> -which uses up to 53%      less electricity than its competitorsis dead. Consumers      were evidently "turned off" by the model's high price . . .      . The Energy Research and Development Administration is      spending $97,466 to determine "the energy conservation      potential of carving beef into boneless commercial cuts      just after slaughtering and before refrigeration and      shipping". ERDA contends that the <strong>ENERGY USED TO      CHILL BONES IN BEEF</strong> wouldif conservedamount to a      yearly savings of 144 million barrels of oil . . . . John      BergerEnergy Projects Director for San Franciscobased      Friends of the Earthhas recently written a book entitled      <strong>NUCLEAR POWER: THE UNVIABLE OPTION,</strong>      available for $4.50 (plus 50 cents postage) from Ramparts      Press, Box 10128, Palo Alto, Calif. 94303 . . . . Two      Japanese firmsthe Citizen Watch Co. and the Orient Watch      Co.have begun to market <strong>SOLAR      WRISTWATCHES.</strong> The Citizen model (priced at around      $159) will run for two days on the energy stored after 10      minutes' exposure to sunlight . . . . Volkswagen      testdrivers have put almost 1,000,000 miles on a fleet of      45 Sciroccos, Audis, Rabbits, and VW buses powered by a      <strong>MIXTURE OF 85% GASOLINE AND 15% METHANOL.</strong>      Results thus far have been "quite promising".    </p>
