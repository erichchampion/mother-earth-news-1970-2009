                           <p>      Roscoe Walker-a busy Atlanta, Georgia      engineer-really knows his beans (and squash and corn      and tomatoes) when it comes to growing a garden. For the      past two years, in fact, Roscoe's vegetable patch has      produced so prolifically that he's been forced to call in      numerous friends and neighbors to help him harvest and      freeze its bounty. .    </p>    <p>      Of course, there's nothing really unusual about Mr.      Walker's harvests. Most gardeners-even      beginners-find themselves up to their elbows in      tomatoes or squash or something by the end of each summer.      What is unusual about Roscoe's success, however, is the      fact that he does so well <em>without cultivating the soil      in his vegetable patch al all, and without doing any hard      work!</em> And what is Mr. Walker's secret? Actually, he      has five of 'em:    </p>    <p>      [1] Roscoe says his gardening system will only work on      plots of land that are well blessed with sunlight. So make      sure your vegetable patch receives at least 25% of the      available solar fall in your area. In short, stay away from      deeply shaded gardening spots if you intend to give      Walker's methods a try.    </p>    <p>      [2] Cover-really cover-your vegetable patch      with natural fertilizer during the winter (sometime from      October through January, and the earlier the better). The      material from a well-decayed compost pile is fine for this      purpose and such humus plus either chicken (Walker's first      choice) or cow manure is even better. Roscoe likes to put      down a half pound per square foot of garden (that's 500      pounds on a plot measuring 20 X 50) and he recommends half      again as much-three-quarters of a pound of the      fertilizer per square foot-for a garden going into      new ground.    </p>    <p>      [3] Once the humus and manure are down, cover the whole      vegetable patch with newspapers. Lay 'em on 10 to 12 sheets      thick and overlap 'em four inches at all joints and seams      to exclude sunlight.    </p>    <p>      [4] Cover the newspapers with six inches of leaves.    </p>    <p>      [5] Cover the leaves with another six inches of pine straw      or rain-damaged hay. Then go away. Don't fret. Don't worry      about what you've done. Don't peek under the hay or leaves      or newspapers every week. Just go away.    </p>    <p>      And wonder upon wonders, when planting time rolls around in      the spring . . . you should find your garden's soil ready      to receive sets and seeds with nary a need, on your part,      for the use of a plow or hoe. Why? Because      earthworms-snug and well-fed under that protective      blanket you put down months before-have been turning      and digesting and enriching the covered dirt. They've been      mixing bits of the humus and manure and newspapers into the      soil too. In short, while you've been thinking of other      things . . . these little "shoemaker's elves" have been      hard at work for you.    </p>    <p>      <em>So</em> hard at work, in fact, that your spring      planting should be the easiest you've ever experienced. "I      just stretch a string where I want a row to go," says      Roscoe. "Then, if I'm setting out started plants, I use a      trowel to open a hole (large enough for each set's roots)      right through what remains of the newspapers. When I'm      putting in beans, peas, and other large seeds, I pierce the      paper with a sharp stick every four inches and drop two      seeds into each hole. And for very small seeds, such as      turnip greens, I cut rows into the paper mulch with a      shovel or knife and sow right through the cut."    </p>    <p>      And then Mr. Walker just sits back and lets Nature work her      wonders. Thanks to the thick carpet of mulch on his garden,      weeds seldom get the chance to make a good start among his      vegetables. And, also thanks to the mulch (which holds      moisture and keeps dry winds and the sun from getting at      the garden's soil), droughts have little or no effect on      his vegetable patch.    </p>    <p>      <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: A heavily mulched garden does indeed      both hold more moisture longer and slay far cooler than an      unmulched one. And this is the reason Mr. Walker emphasizes      that his methods be used only can a sunny vegetable patch.      Otherwise, the soil in the plot would be slow in warm</em>      <em>ing up in the ,spring . . . and might stay just a      little too cool and damp for best plant propagation      throughout much of the summer.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Roscoe Walker has two further tips for gardeners: [1] Never      throw away organic garbage of any kind. It's worth      something to your vegetable patch <em>any</em> time of the      year. Just spade or dump it into the garden-whatever      the season-and cover it with newspapers and straw to      keep down odors and hasten the offering's decomposition,      [2] Instead of reaching for a poison spray <em>after</em>      harmful insects start chomping on your prized vegetables,      buy a pint of ladybugs and two clusters of praying mantis      eggs before the trouble starts. If you distribute these      little predators among your garden's rows according to      directions, you should have a minimum amount of trouble      with the "bad guys" as the season wears on.    </p>
