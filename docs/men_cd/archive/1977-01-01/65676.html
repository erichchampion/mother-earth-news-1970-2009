                            <p>      For many folks, buying that first horse (or cow, or goat)      is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. And for some, the      veterinarian bills that follow can soon turn into a      nightmare.    </p>    <p>      "There's an easy way to cut some of those medical expenses      quite drastically, however," say Ron and Linda Martin of      Imbler, Oregon. "Namely, perform your own injections!" The      Martins speak from experience: They recently gave their      horse-Long John Silver-both antibiotic and      tetanus shots after the animal suffered a deep puncture      wound on some hidden barbed wire. Here's how they did it:    </p>    <p>      First, the couple asked their vet-who had treated      Long John before-what drugs to buy, what dosages to      give, the gauge of needle to use, etc.    </p>    <p>      Next, Ron and Linda searched the Yellow Pages for the      address of the nearest veterinary supply house, and drove      out to the establishment. There, they bought the following      equipment:    </p>    <p>      [1] <strong>NEEDLES.</strong> "Initially, we made the      mistake of buying 314" needles," says Linda. "Well, they      weren't nearly long enough to put an injection as deeply      into a horse's muscle tissue as a shot should go,      and-as a result-Long John developed several      large abcesses where we gave the antibiotics. We thought      for sure we'd murdered our beloved horse! (The lumps,      however, disappeared within 10 days.) Now we know enough to      use 1-1/2", 18-gauge needles for our horses, and save the      3/4" ones for our goats' shots."    </p>    <p>      [2] <strong>SYRINGES.</strong> "The plastic, disposable      kind served us well in the beginning," remarks Linda, "but      we now prefer a permanent nylon syringe that we can      sterilize and reuse many times." (Note: Syringes come in      different sizes and must-therefore-be chosen      with a specific dosage of medication in mind.)    </p>    <p>      [3] <strong>DISINFECTANT.</strong> The Martins chose to      store their reusable injection equipment in <em>quaternary      ammonium</em> disinfectant (sold under such trade names as      <em>Cetavlon, Desogen,</em> and <em>Bradosol</em> ), rather      than alcohol, which can adversely affect certain medicines      and syringes.    </p>    <p>      [4] MEDICATION. Here, Ron and Linda-on the advice of      their vet-bought an antibiotic preparation called      <em>Combiotic,</em> to stop the infection that was      developing in Long John's wound. They also bought tetanus      antitoxin, to protect the animal against tetanus. "It's      important to note," says Linda, "that there are two kinds      of tetanus medication: a long-acting <em>toxoid,</em>      intended to be given once yearly . . . and a short-term      antitoxin for use when injuries occur between yearly shots.      We bought the second kind for Long John."    </p>    <p>      After purchasing their injection equipment, Ron and Linda      read everything they could find on injuries, injections,      medicines, anatomy, etc. Says Linda: "This 'boning up'      taught us-among other things-that different drugs      must be injected in different ways. We learned, for      instance, that tetanus antitoxin must be given      <em>subcutaneously</em> -or just under the      skin-while most antibiotics are given      <em>intramuscularly,</em> or deep in the muscle.    </p>    <p>      "We also learned that it's extremely important-before      giving a shot-to hold the syringe straight up, tap it      with your finger to bring air bubbles up to the needle, and      press the plunger to expel those bubbles. Otherwise, if      that air were to be injected into the animal's bloodstream,      the beast would die."    </p>    <p>      Giving the subcutaneous tetanus shot was a cinch. Linda      summarizes the procedure this way: "All you do is use your      thumb and first finger to pick up some skin in the middle      of the horse's neck . . . then you pull the fold away from      the neck, slide the needle under the pinched skin (you can      feel it pierce the hide), inject the serum, and withdraw      the needle. Unbelievable as it may seem, the horse probably      won't even flinch."    </p>    <p>      The <em>Combiotic</em> shots (one per day for five days)      were no harder than the tetanus injection . . . once Ron      and Linda had learned where to give them. "We tried twice      to stick Long John in the rump," says Linda, "and both      times, we nearly got kicked halfway across the corral!"      After thinking over their earlier success with the      subcutaneous tetanus shot, the couple finally decided to      administer the antibiotics into their horse's neck muscles.    </p>    <p>      "A very experienced friend of ours had offered some advice      to us on how to give I.M.-intramuscular-shots,      and it turned out to be right on the mark. He told us:      'Give I.M. injections in the <em>hollow of the neck</em>      <em>or the rump.</em> If in the neck, insert the needle      deep and at a slight downward angle, following the flow of      the muscle. If in the rump, just get in and out as quickly      as possible with a downward motion from above!'"    </p>    <p>      (Note: In the case of an intramuscular injection, it's      always a good idea-before pushing the syringe's      plunger down-to check to see that a vein hasn't been      hit by mistake. To do this, pull gently on the plunger. If      blood appears in the syringe's chamber, a vein HAS been hit      and a new injection site should be chosen.)    </p>    <p>      Certainly, do-it-yourself injections are not entirely free      of risks. If strict sanitation is not practiced, for      example, the animal may develop a painful infection at the      site of the injection. Also, some beasts-though not      many-are "allergic" to various drugs and react      adversely to them.    </p>    <p>      "Still," say Ron and Linda Martin, "anyone who can hold a      pencil should be able to give shots to their      livestock-safely and economically-if he or she      will take the time to seek counsel from a vet, talk to      knowledgeable friends, consult books, locate-and buy      goods from-a veterinary supply house, practice      painstakingly good sanitation, and keep careful records of      symptoms, dates, drug names, dosages, etc. Do all this, and      your beasties will live healthfully ever after!"    </p>
