                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Aspirin-New Uses, New Questions    </h2>        <h3>      Dr. Tom Ferguson    </h3>    <p>      <em>This issue's column was guest-written for Dr. Tom      Ferguson by a contributor to</em> Medical Self-Care      <em>magazine.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Richard Pearce, Ph.D.    </h3>    <p>      It's in more purses, desk drawers, and medicine cabinets      than any other drug. It's a mainstay for headaches, fevers,      arthritis, colds, cramps, aches, and pains. It's the      subject of countless physicians' recommendations to "take      two and call me in the morning." It's acetylsalicylic      acid-aspirin-and no drug in history has been      taken so casually by so many for so long.    </p>    <p>      For many consumers, recent research has elevated aspirin's      status from that of a simple pain reliever to that of a      potential wonder drug.    </p>    <p>      Some scientists say it may be able to prevent everything      from heart attack and stroke to cataracts, gallstones, and      sickle-cell anemia.    </p>    <p>      But don't rush to your medicine chest just yet. For every      study showing that aspirin might have newfound benefits,      there's another showing new risks. Pregnant women are      advised to avoid it altogether. The Food and Drug      Administration (FDA) may order manufacturers to add      cautionary labels to the drug, warning consumers not to      give it to children with fevers because of its      association-widely noted but still      unproven-with potentially fatal Reye's syndrome.    </p>    <p>      Like all drugs, aspirin is a double-edged sword, and today      both edges cut deeper than ever before.    </p>    <h3>      Heart-Attack Prevention?    </h3>    <p>      Aspirin has been used for thousands of years, but only      recently have scientists learned how it works at the      cellular level. In 1971 aspirin was shown to inhibit      production of prostaglandins, a family of hormonelike      substances found throughout the body. Prostaglandins are      associated with pain, inflammation, and menstrual      problems... hence aspirin's ability to alleviate pain,      inflammation, and mild menstrual cramps.    </p>    <p>      But it's been the suggestion that aspirin may be useful in      preventing heart attacks that has thrust the drug into the      medical limelight. In a half-dozen studies from 1974      through 1980, more than 10,000 people who had had one heart      attack took aspirin to see if it could significantly reduce      their risk of another. Half the participants took one to      five aspirin tablets a day for up to three years. The rest      took a placebo. In all but one study, the aspirin users      suffered fewer cardiac problems, including heart attacks,      and had a lower overall death rate than those who took the      placebo. But the differences between the two groups were      not statistically significant. Furthermore, the largest      study's findings took everyone by surprise and raised some      disturbing questions.    </p>    <p>      That trial was the $7 million AMIS study (Aspirin      Myocardial Infarction Study) sponsored by the National      Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Every participant in this      double-blind study had had at least one heart attack. Half      took the equivalent of one extra-strength aspirin tablet a      day. The rest took a placebo. At the end of the three-year      study, the aspirin group showed 22% fewer nonfatal heart      attacks... but their total overall mortality rate was      actually higher. Why? No one knows. The aspirin users      reported twice as many cases of nausea, vomiting,      constipation, and peptic ulcers as the placebo takers. The      reduction in heart-attack risk was not statistically      significant. In fact, the only thing the AMIS project      demonstrated conclusively was the all-too-familiar link      between aspirin and gas-trointestinal problems.    </p>    <p>      To find out "once and for all" if aspirin reduces risk of      heart attack, Harvard Medical School has launched a new      four-year double-blind study involving physicians      themselves as the subjects. So far, 30,000 healthy      physicians over 40 have enrolled. The idea is to see if      aspirin can prevent first heart attacks and strokes in      people who do not have cardiovascular disease. The study,      the most ambitious of its kind ever attempted, should yield      a wealth of information in the late 1980's-if the      doctors remember to take their medicine.    </p>    <h3>      Pregnant Women Beware    </h3>    <p>      Anyone who watches TV knows that aspirin can upset the      stomach, aggravate ulcers, and cause other gastrointestinal      problems. But, like many drugs, its most hazardous side      effects occur when it is used by pregnant women. An      estimated two-thirds of all pregnant women use aspirin.      Animal studies leave little doubt that aspirin can cause      birth defects, but human studies are more ambiguous.      Several European studies have implicated the drug as a      cause of infant malformation, including one Finnish study      that showed that mothers of infants with cleft palates had      taken three times as much aspirin during pregnancy as      mothers who gave birth to normal infants. But other      research, including the large American Perinatal      Collaborative Project, has shown no link between aspirin      and any birth defects. At this writing, it's impossible to      state definitively if aspirin causes human birth defects,      but caution is certainly advised.    </p>    <h3>      Aspirin and the Immune System    </h3>    <p>      Aspirin appears to reduce the effectiveness of interferon,      the body's natural antiviral protein. Laboratory studies      show that when living cells are bathed in an aspirin      solution, they promptly lose their ability to use      interferon, and are killed by invading viruses. In these      experiments, aspirin reduced the antiviral effect of      interferon by a factor of 1,000. This finding means that      people who take aspirin for colds may prolong the life of      the cold virus and spread their colds to more people.    </p>    <p>      Aspirin may also cause a temporary but dramatic decrease in      serum complement, a family of proteins necessary to defend      successfully against viruses and bacteria. Healthy      individuals, apparently, can cope with this temporary loss      of protection, but some doctors worry about aspirin use by      people already deficient in serum complement because of      ongoing or recent infection.    </p>    <p>      Aspirin and other antipros-taglandins may also interfere      with the immune system's ability to distinguish between      disease agents and the body's own cells. Aspirin seems to      interfere with the activity of suppressor T lymphocytes,      which normally check excess antibody production. Nobody      knows whether this possible action of aspirin may trigger      such autoimmune disorders as Guillain-Barré syndrome      or multiple sclerosis; however, quite a few cases of      Guillain-Barré followed the U.S. swine-flu      immunization program a few years ago. Did those who      developed Guillain-Barré take aspirin to relieve the      muscle soreness associated with their flu shots? Nobody      knows. But a strikingly similar pattern links aspirin use      by feverish children to Reye's syndrome. At present, there      is no hard evidence that aspirin-related decreases in viral      defenses do any harm.    </p>    <p>      But the implications of all the new research into the      drug's effects are clear: Aspirin is not for everyone. It      clearly provides relief from pain and inflammation. It may      reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. Recent reports have      suggested that it may be of value in the management of      cataracts, sickle-cell anemia, gallstones, and food      allergies. And if aspirin is used cautiously and only when      appropriate, it will probably remain a reasonably safe way      to deal with some of life's more painful moments.    </p>    <p>      But for each of its many benefits, aspirin can also do harm      when used by the wrong person at the wrong time.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Medical Self-Care <em>, Dr. Tom      Ferguson's quarterly journal, is available for $15 per year      from Medical Self-Care, P.O.
