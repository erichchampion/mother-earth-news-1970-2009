                    <p>      <em>In the search for efficiency, we often overlook the      less tangible rewards of a do-it-yourself project.</em>    </p>    <hr />        <h5 id="byline">      by Burnell Lippy    </h5>    <p>      Last June, after spending several months of my spare time      cutting and limbing balsam and fir trees with a 42" bow saw      and a double-bladed ax, I was able to sit atop my hillside      property and-with no small feeling of      satisfaction-view the 100 logs that I'd need to build      my home. A full third of those timbers rested within a mere      100 feet of my home-site. My satisfaction began to turn to      apprehension, though, as I forced myself to face the fact      that an <em>equal</em> portion of the logs was stacked some      200 feet away, at the bottom of a 20Â° slope . . . while      the rest of my home-to-be (stacked far enough away to      resemble a pile of jackstraws from where I sat) was a full      100 yards <em>beyond</em> the bottom of that hill.    </p>    <p>      In the past I had often hand-carried or dragged small logs,      tipi poles, and the like from one site to another. But      <em>these</em> timbers were each about 22 feet long and      averaged 10 inches in diameter. So I made arrangements with      a local logger to bring his horse and skid to move the logs      to the site, offering to trade him two hours of my labor      for every hour he and his horse spent getting the felled      trees moved.    </p>    <p>      Though that gentleman was agreeable to my proposed swap, it      would be-he said-a week or so before he'd have      time to do the job. So I decided to use that delay in an      attempt to move at least <em>some</em> of the logs to the      site myself (and maybe, while doing so, regain a little of      the sense of accomplishment I'd felt after felling and      branching the trees by hand).    </p>    <p>      In order to tackle that imposing task, I borrowed an idea      from a friend, Jon Denner, who-while building a 25' X      25' log cabin in Vermont-had moved <em>all</em> of      the logs without a horse, skidder, or tractor. Jon managed      to do it with "a little help from his friends" . . .      <em>and</em> from a crude levering device that he used to      "row" the logs out of the woods.    </p>    <p>      Following the hints the Vermonter had passed along, I      duplicated his tool from a five-foot length of 3"-diameter      birch and eight feet of 5/8" hemp rope. First, using my ax,      I sharpened the thicker end of the stick... and then tied      the rope to the birch pole at a point approximately 15      inches above the top of that ax-formed taper.    </p>    <p>      I must admit that the <em>appearance</em> of this simple      tool wasn't exactly confidence-inspiring. Still, I went      ahead and used a clove hitch to tie the free end of the      hemp about one foot in from the end of the log closest to      my home-site. I then stabbed the pointed end of the stick      into the ground and pulled back on the top. Much to my      surprise, this technique allowed me to propel that log over      a distance of 50 feet in a relatively short time without      damaging my back, arms, legs, or morale. Inspired by that      success, I decided to improve on the technique by setting      up a runway of 4' -long log-end skids-held in place      by driven pegs-before getting back to work.    </p>    <p>      As that day progressed, I found myself thinking of the      stick-and-string contraption as a "galley slaver" because      of the rowing motion I used to inch the logs along the      railroad of skids. However, I didn't <em>feel</em> I was      slaving. In fact, I found that I rather enjoyed the      experience of hauling my own logs... for my own house ...      at my own pace . . . across my own land . . . <em>and</em>      for my own reasons!    </p>    <p>      And that's why, after two weeks without hearing anything      more from the logger, I decided to "go for it"... to try to      bring <em>all</em> of the logs to the site by using the      galley-slaver-and-skid technique. The first group of      timbers-those within 100 feet of the site-were      moved into place without incident. Once I began inching the      second group up the hillside, though, I quickly developed a      feel for the limitations of my low-tech tool. Smaller logs      didn't present much of a problem; I was able to move them      along in slow, but relatively easy, 20-inch bites. But the      bigger timbers were another story altogether. Often I'd jam      the point of my lever into the ground, lean back with a      grunt of effort, and then sit down very suddenly as the      point of the galley slaver tore itself through the earth      without moving the log an inch.    </p>    <p>      Still, the job wasn't impossible. After learning to really      <em>ram</em> that stick down into the soil, I began to make      progress with even the most massive timbers. Within a week      of working three or four hours each afternoon, I'd      successfully inched the second group of logs up the      200-foot slope to my house site.    </p>    <p>      The final 33 trees were, of course, still down the hill and      another 100 yards back in the woods. I didn't have enough      skid logs to run a railway that full distance, so I found      myself leapfrogging the rollers . . . moving those I'd      already passed over up ahead of the log being hauled. It      was (appropriately enough) almost Labor Day when I finished      the job... and, with the exception of one three-week      interruption, I'd been at the task for about four hours a      day, five or six days a week.    </p>    <p>      Altogether, the time I spent leapfrogging, rowing, inching,      pondering, coaxing, and cajoling those logs to my homesite      was about 85 hours. Now, if the logger and his horse had      shown up, we could probably have gotten the whole job done      in two eight-hour days. Then, after completing my      two-for-one labor exchange with that gentleman, I'd have      had a total of 48 hours invested in the task . . . about      half as much time as I'd consumed doing the job by myself.    </p>    <p>      Based on that fact alone, you could say that my      galley-slaver logging system was a triumph of inefficiency.      And there were times when I certainly would have agreed      with that analysis-for instance, when the gnats were      thunderclouding around my eyes or when my lever tore a      trench in the earth and let a log slip <em>backward</em> a      few precious feet. But, more often than not, I'd find      myself thinking that efficiency must be like happiness,      which someone once said "cannot be achieved in less than a      complete lifetime." That sage meant, I think, that      contentment isn't the result of a few isolated events, but      is-instead-the interweaving of the rhythms and      events that make up a person's entire life.    </p>    <p>      And that bit of philosophy let me see, during the times      when the job <em>was</em> proceeding in small but      satisfying increments, that my struggle with the galley      slaver might well have been <em>very</em> efficient in      teaching me lessons about perseverance, confidence,      ingenuity, and self-reliance . . . lessons that I'll be      able to profit from in the future whenever apprehension      threatens to overshadow personal satisfaction.    </p>
