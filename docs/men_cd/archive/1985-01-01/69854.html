    <p>
                    <p>      The conventional Flush toilet uses between five and seven      gallons of water to clear its bowl-an amount that is      only occasionally truly needed to do a thorough job. More      often than not, just a couple of gallons of water are      sufficient to rinse away liquids. Unfortunately, for the      sake of convenience toilets aren't equipped to deal with      such inequalities.    </p>    		<p>      Solution: Modify <em>your</em> commode so that it can      control the volume of the flush to meet the need. It's as      simple as cutting a piece of brass rod to the proper length      and bending hooks into each end.    </p>    <p>      Most toilets have chains between the arms on their handles      and the flapper valve. When you push down on the handle,      the flapper lifts. When you let go, the flapper stays up      because it's filled with air and floats. When the tank is      drained, the flapper falls back into place.    </p>    <p>      If you were able to force the flapper down <em>before</em>      all the water had drained out of the tank, though, you'd      save that much liquid. And to do that, you need a rigid      connection between the lever arm on the handle and the      flapper.    </p>    <p>      So lift the lid off the top of your toilet tank, and      measure the distance the chain spans between its hole in      the lever arm and the flapper valve. Cut a piece of 3/32"      or 1/8" brass rod (brazing rod will work well) to that      length plus 1-1/2". Then bend the last 3/4" of each end to      form a hook, as shown in the photo (be sure the bends are      oriented properly to fit in the holes in the arm and the      flapper). Slip the hooks into the holes, and your      water-saving commode will be ready to flush.    </p>    <p>      It'll probably take a little experimenting to anticipate      just how much water will be needed to clear the bowl, and      you'll have to spend a few extra seconds in the necessary      room while waiting for the right moment to push the handle      up. (Of course, if you're smitten by a real fit of      laziness, the rod will still allow an unattended      full-volume flush.) But, by taking control, you can      substantially cut the amount of water you use for toilet      flushing.    </p>
