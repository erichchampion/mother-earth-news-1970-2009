                    <p>      <em>Would you like to build yourself a small, temporary      home for a little more than $1,000?</em>    </p>    <hr />    <h5 id="byline">      by Norm Lee    </h5>    <p>      Like so many other home builders, my wife, Sherrie, and I      needed a quickly and easily built shelter to live in while      our permanent house was being constructed... but we wanted      one that was sturdy enough-and of a suitable      design-to be used later as a workshop, small barn, or      guest house. It had to be inexpensive, since most of our      funds had gone into a down payment on our land; but with      winter coming on, it also had to be warm and windtight. The      question was, what could we put together with these      qualifications?    </p>    <p>      A neighbor's garage, built with Starplate connectors, was      our inspiration. After a speculative look at the triangular      walls, Sherrie decided that the pentagon-shaped dome      (actually a truncated icosahedron having fifteen sides) had      potential as a heat-efficient, cozy home with a loft.    </p>           <p>      Now, the loft idea was intriguing, but, as far as I knew,      Starplate buildings weren't designed to be fifteen feet      high, allowing for two floors. The eleven steel plates that      come in the kit are designed to bolt to the ends of      six-foot 2 X 2's or eight-foot 2 X 4's. Could they handle      ten-foot 2 X 6's?    </p>    <p>      We called David Hamel, engineer and inventor of the      Starplate connectors (which are now made by United Steel      Products of Montgomery, Minnesota), to find out. "Nobody's      ever tried building a house with them," he told us. But, we      asked, if the roof peak was supported by an oak post, why      couldn't it work? "Either that, or run a cable around the      eaves to tie the five roof struts together," Hamel      suggested. Otherwise, he didn't recommend anything larger      than a nine-foot strut. We considered the risks and the      options... and decided to go for ten-footers.    </p>    <p>      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Norm and Sherrie were fortunate to live      in an area where the building code requirements present few      problems. They needed a permit from the town in order to      put up a building, and an inspector checked their wiring,      but they had no other stringent rules to follow. Whatever      you do, check with your local inspector-call the town      clerk to find out who the correct official is-before      making extensive plans or buying materials.]</em>    </p>    <h3>      FRAME, FOOTER, AND FLOOR    </h3>    <p>      We used our VW camper to truck the struts to our building      site: 20 ten-foot 2 X 6's for the walls, and 5 twelve-foot      2 X 6's for the roof (the extra length was to accommodate      the eaves). Drilling holes through the 6" width of the      timbers, 1-1/2" from their ends, was easy as long as we      were careful to keep the drill lined up properly, and      assembling the roof was like putting together an adult-size      Tinkertoy set. In fact, the back-to-childhood nature of the      construction attracted a number of onlookers who wanted to      participate!    </p>    <p>      By the time we had the timbers bolted together, there were      enough hands to lift the entire frame and set it on its      base.    </p>    <p>      The foundation for the cabin was nothing more than five      railroad ties laid right on top of the ground and leveled      with flat rocks. No holes. No cement. No blocks. The cabin      has hunkered down on those ties for two years now, and      hasn't budged despite the fury of mountain winds and winter      storms. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: The Starplate instruction      booklet shows how to erect a building on the ground, on a      wooden frame, on posts and footings, or on a concrete slab,      according to your needs.]</em> The base struts are nailed      to the ties, which also serve to support the floor joists.      We laid heavy plastic sheeting on the joists as a moisture      barrier before laying down the subflooring.    </p>    <p>      Templates supplied with the kit's instruction manual made      simple work of cutting the angles for the bracing nailers.      These additional timbers were fitted between the main      struts to support the side and roof panels. Since the frame      is somewhat flexible before the wall panels are applied,      the measurements are less precise than those found in      conventional frame construction. We soon discovered that      the best procedure was to tack the 4' X 8' waferboard      sheets right on the triangular frames and mark them for      cutting. There was very little waste: The scrap pieces      fitted neatly into the various little corners still left to      be covered. Roofing cement, liberally applied, made an      airtight seal along the seams before we applied the felt      tar paper to the walls and the roof.    </p>    <p>      Once we had the waferboard secured to the struts and      nailers, it dawned on us that we were building a cabin of      considerable strength. When four hefty men climbed on the      roof and it barely shivered, we realized that, in addition      to simplifying and speeding up the process of construction,      the metal plates at every joint were distributing the load      through the entire structure. We decided a center post was      unnecessary, so we dropped the idea.    </p>    <p>      We made a double-paned window by sealing together two      flea-market storm windows. Naturally, any opening in an      angled wall needs careful sealing, and we found that going      twice around the windows with caulking provided good      waterproofing protection.    </p>    <p>      Although one of the options offered in the instruction      manual is a "square front" wall to accommodate a door, we      chose not to use it. We decided it would be wiser to gain a      bit more space by adding a 4' X 8' entrance-way on the      southeast wall and then building the door and several      windows into it. This would make the cabin roomier and      would protect the interior from icy blasts whenever the      door was opened in winter; meanwhile, the southeast-facing      windows were a welcome feature on cold sunny mornings.    </p>    <p>      Tying the frame of the foyer to the angular walls of the      cabin was tricky, but once the floor frame was squared off      with the base strut and the corner posts were braced in a      plumb position, we had only to extend horizontal 2 X 4's to      the cabin walls and mark them for cutting. The angles      weren't perfect, but they worked.    </p>    <p>      We made sure to put headboard insulation in the entranceway      floor; otherwise, its 32 square feet could make the room      uncomfortably chilly. After all, winter nights here in      upstate New York can reach -20Â°F.    </p>    <h3>      LOFT, INSULATION, AND CELOTEX    </h3>    <p>      The ten-foot sides of our shelter gave us about 178 square      feet of floor space. This, plus the entranceway's 32, gave      us a total of some 210 square feet of living space:      admittedly, not much for two people. The roof peak now      soared over fourteen feet above the center of the room,      however, and there seemed to be ample room for a sleeping      loft. To avoid putting a load on the cabin's nonvertical      walls, we first shored up the main floor to support extra      weight, then constructed a 10' X 10' loft frame and raised      it to sit on top of seven-foot-tall 4X4 posts. Flooring for      the loft was then extended with extra plywood and bracing      to fit out to the pentagonal walls. An opening was left for      access to the upper area via ladder. The additional room      thus created gave us another 153-1/2 square feet of living      space for a much-needed bedroom and office, which greatly      enhanced the usefulness of the shelter.    </p>    <p>      Odd spaces left by the roof rafters and nailers were fitted      with 6" fiberglass insulation and covered with inexpensive      Celotex panels. (The walls did fine with 3-1/2" batts of      fiberglass.) Cutting and fitting the fiberglass was no      problem, but handling the 4' X 8' Celotex panels in the      small loft space did present a challenge. We finally cut      all the panels on the ground floor, then handed the pieces      up to the loft crew to be nailed in place.    </p>		    <h3>      ROOFING, SIDING . . . AND LIVING    </h3>    <p>      We were fortunate to have a friend with previous experience      who directed the application of our 90-pound roll roofing      so that it was done correctly. While less carefully      constructed buildings lost their tops to our fierce winds,      the Starhut's roof held firm... and the building itself has      endured near-hurricane-force gales night after night with      hardly a quiver. The angled walls of our Starplate special      seem to split those winds in two.    </p>    <p>      The siding party was composed of a computer programmer, a      cook, two former nuns, an army major, and a salesman... but      despite the lack of an experienced professional carpenter,      we managed very well. After we sealed the seams and applied      the tar paper, we started nailing on what's known around      here as "Adirondack siding": oak slabs with one edge      trimmed. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: By an odd coincidence, it's      called</em> Carolina <em>siding hereabouts... and no doubt      it's known as Rocky Mountain siding along the Great      Divide!]</em>    </p>    <p>      Our plan was to apply the siding first to the walls that      leaned outward at the base; it should then be a simple      matter to trim off the ends and lay the siding on the walls      that leaned <em>inward</em> , allowing that oak to extend      an inch or two over the ends of the first-applied slabs.      Actually, as it turned out, a snowstorm caught us before we      could get the first day's siding trimmed... and there the      project was left for the winter. We moved in, just the      same.    </p>    <p>      As of this writing, we're still living in our Starplate      cabin. Apparently, the unfinished siding hasn't affected      the building's heat efficiency, because it takes a minimum      of firewood to keep the place warm. When winter night      temperatures are below zero, we keep the stove going around      the clock; when it's a bit less frigid, we let the fire go      out at bedtime, then simply rebuild it in the morning. An      air-circulating fan blows the heat around, and within ten      minutes we're sitting down comfortably to breakfast.    </p>    <p>      A few feet away, our under-construction pole home awaits      windows, doors, and insulation... elements we can purchase      as our budget permits and install at our own pace. We don't      require luxurious quarters, and our inexpensive, snug      Starhut allows us the real luxury of paying as we go on the      permanent home. When the time comes, it'll be easy to      connect the electrical and water lines to the new house and      convert the cabin into an insulated, heated workshop.    </p>    <h3>      IN RETROSPECT...    </h3>    <p>      If we had it to do again, we feel the only change we'd make      is perhaps to add light and headroom by putting a dormer      window in the loft. We've found ourselves using the office      space more than we'd anticipated, so the expense of a      skylight or window would have been justified.    </p>    <p>      And although there's no precedent for it yet, <em>I</em>      think you could put up a Starplate structure that used      twelve-foot struts. Our domed shelter has proved itself to      be completely sturdy through the roughest weather, without      a deep foundation, a centerpost, or a cable around the      eaves. In fact, we're so pleased with our home that we've      gone on to use Starplate connectors for a greenhouse, a      tractor garage, a pony barn, a woodshed, and a garden      gazebo. We feel it's the ideal answer for the beginning      homesteader who wants to settle on his or her land and be      free of rental payments at last.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Starplate connectors are available in      many areas, but if you can't find them where you live, you      can order a set of 11 for $39.95 postpaid from Homesteaders      News, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 517, Naples, NY 14512.</em>    </p>
