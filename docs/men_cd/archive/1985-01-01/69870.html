                    <p>      <em>If you're watching your livestock pasture turn to      desert, there's hope for greener times with...</em>    </p><hr />                    <h5 id="byline">     by Sam Bingham    </h5>    <p>      Most Americans have forgotten that, back before the      historic and colorful cattle drives of the late 1800's, our      western rangelands stood tall in rich grasses that      supported vast herds of bison and other wild ungulates.      Today, much of the same land is barren and parched,      providing only a marginal living for a scant few sheep and      cattle.    </p>    <p>      It's our own fault, of course: Our ancestors extirpated the      bison, fenced in the land, and packed it with herds of      cattle and sheep. The cattle and sheep killed the grass by      overgrazing, and with the grass went the remaining wildlife      and the best of the topsoil-topsoil that had      supported abundant plant and animal life for millenia.      After a century of such abuse, the land began showing      symptoms of desertification: flash floods and erosion, dust      and silt, tumbleweed and scrub.    </p>    <p>      And though many have tried, none have been able to restore      native grasslands once they were lost to desertification      from overgrazing. Some tried by planting seed, others by      burning, bulldozing, or poisoning desert brush. Still      others killed off wild game and even their own livestock to      reduce grazing pressure on the land. And all failed because      they were merely putting Band-Aids on symptoms.    </p>    <p>      But help may be just across the pasture: Over the past      three decades, a totally different approach to arid-country      grazing practices-called holistic resource      management, or HRM-has been taking shape.    </p>    <p>      HRM says that if you can identify and put into balance      certain critical aspects of nature, the trend toward      desertification will be reversed: Grass and livestock      production will increase dramatically, and the land will      heal itself.    </p>    <h3>      A SYMBIOSIS    </h3>    <p>      Conventional wisdom blames dead grass on big herds and      overgrazing, yet fails to explain how millions of large      grazing animals evolved and thrived on the very same land      for thousands of years without destroying the grass as      cattle and sheep have done in just one century.    </p>    <p>      What it boils down to, says HRM thinking, is that everyone      knows that ungulates need grass, but not everyone knows      that grass needs ungulates. It does: Minerals and organic      nutrients don't recycle properly without the help of large      animals that drop dung. Seeds won't germinate or rainwater      get absorbed unless the soil is broken up by sharp hooves.    </p>    <p>      And unbitten grass will simply die of old age. In short,      without the impact of grazing herds, the natural balance of      plant and animal life is destroyed.    </p>    <p>      The vast herds of wild bison and their kindred held up      their end of the bargain perfectly-they nipped off      the tops of their favorite plants, then moved on to graze      on greener pastures. The only reason domestic animals don't      do the same is that we won't let them.    </p>    <p>      One of the first to recognize that poor management rather      than numbers of animals was the root cause of overgrazing      was Allan Savory, who is the leading authority on and chief      advocate of holistic resource management in America today.    </p>    <p>      While working as a wildlife biologist in Zimbabwe (then      Southern Rhodesia) in the 1950's, Savory was amazed to      discover that the great national parks of Africa supported      far greater numbers of large grazing animals than did the      professionally managed ranches on adjacent land. While the      Rhodesian ranchers watched their best grass species      disappear, and called alternately for drought relief and      flood control, the parks' natural ecosystems thrived: The      springs didn't dry up, the top-soil didn't wash or blow      away, and the wild herds prospered.    </p>    <p>      "Without doubt," Savory reports having reflected at the      time, "the great grasslands and the large grazing animals      evolved simultaneously. Could there be a symbiotic      relationship? The American bison and pronghorn antelope      were no different in their grazing habits than the African      buffalo. The Great Plains probably supported far more wild      animals per acre than any modern rancher would dare carry,      and yet wild bison rarely overgrazed. But if the      <em>number</em> of animals wasn't the cause of overgrazing,      what was?"    </p>        <h3>      A NEW APPROACH TO AN OLD PROBLEM    </h3>    <p>      With those thoughts and questions in mind, Savory teamed up      with the Rhodesian ranchers to take a fresh look at the      dynamics of overgrazing, paying particular attention to the      relationship between grasslands and the animals that lived      on them. In the course of their research, they were      delighted to discover the book <em>Grass Productivity</em>      , by French agricultural researcher Andre Voisin.    </p>    <p>      Voisin had done the bulk of his research shortly after      World War II and was the first to observe that overgrazing      isn't caused by too many animals on a given pasture;      rather, overgrazing occurs when animals bite off the tops      of the same growing plants time and again until the plants      die. Voisin further stated that a single cow will overgraze      certain favored plants if it is allowed to linger in an      area long enough, but even large herds won't overgraze if      they move constantly to new ground and don't return until      the previously grazed plants have had time to recover.    </p>    <p>      Today, with nearly 30 years of research, observation, and      experience to his credit, Allan Savory is convinced that      Voisin was right. Even city folk, he maintains, can see      this principle at work: Lawns seldom show the      characteristics of overgrazing, even when they're mowed      quite short, because people usually don't cut grass until      it has regrown to the point where it <em>needs</em>      cutting.    </p>    <p>      But if a rancher puts just a few cows or sheep on a      pasture, even a <em>big</em> pasture, the animals will      selectively overgraze their favorite plants. Voisin      developed a formula for concentrating and moving stock that      solved this problem and revolutionized livestock production      in Europe and New Zealand. In those areas where Voisin's      techniques were put to trial, grass production tripled, and      the forest no longer attempted to invade pasture, as it had      in the past.    </p>    <p>      To accomplish this, Voisin used fences to divide large      pastures into several smaller pastures, called cells, and      shuttled the livestock from cell to cell according to a set      formula that allowed the grazed grasses in a particular      cell ample time to rejuvenate before the herd returned to      graze them again.    </p>    <p>      But Voisin's formula didn't work in Africa. There, as in      the dry American West, domestic stock seemed to push      succession backward-from grassland to desert, rather      than forward toward forest.    </p>    <p>      To make Voisin's theories work in the African grasslands,      Savory and the ranchers adopted the French researcher's      fencing techniques, but had to let go of his fixed      stock-rotation formula and manage their resources as Mother      Nature intended: They moved their animals from one grazing      area to another according to observed growth rates of the      grass, rather than by a predetermined and rigid schedule.    </p>    <p>      The experiment worked, and Savory felt that they had proven      his hunch that on fragile grasslands, natural growth      processes stagnate without an occasional ground-disturbing      trampling by herds of hoofed animals. In fact, Savory found      that most ranges suffered more from too much <em>rest</em>      than they did from too many grazing animals.    </p>    <h3>      HOLISTIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT    </h3>    <p>      Holistic resource management offers a Santa's sack of tools      and techniques to help get your domestic stock to do for      the land what the wild herds once did. A commercial ranch      can apply sophisticated refinements that often allow the      doubling of stocking rates per acre. Most of these      refinements spring from the idea that controlling grazing      time-and thus herd impact-is critical.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      If You Want to Leam More About HRM...    </h3>    <p>      <em>The principles of holistic resource management have      proven successful in many climates and economic situations,      from Africa to Hawaii to the Colorado plateau. But each      situation does require separate evaluation and application      of the basic techniques... and, therefore, adequate      knowledge of the workings of HRM.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To get basic information about how to start, many      concerned ranchers are attending the seminars run by Allan      Savory through the Center for Holistic Resource Management.      A one-week introductory course covers the fundamentals:      About half the class time goes to range and stock      management, the rest to financial and administrative      planning. The curriculum is updated continuously to      incorporate the latest HRM knowledge. Attending one session      of the school entitles you to participate in future      sessions free.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If you can't spare the time or money to attend the      school, the next best thing is to talk to someone who has      attended. School alumni-including ranchers,      agricultural extension agents, and      consultants-constitute an informal group willing to      share experience and ideas. On request, the center will      provide the names and addresses of alumni in your      area.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In addition to such lists of knowledgeable people,      information about ranchers' workshops and</em> The Savory      Letter <em>(the school's newsletter) can be obtained by      writing to the Center for Holistic Resource Management,      P.O. Box 7128, Albuquerque, NM 87194.</em>    </p>		</div>    <p>      Once you learn them, many of the techniques of holistic      resource management can be put to work almost overnight.      And it's not just big-time ranchers who can benefit from      HRM. Even if you have only a few head of livestock on a      small piece of land, there's an excellent chance that HRM      can improve your pasture and your livestock productivity.    </p>		<p>      If you raise livestock in dry country, begin by studying      the growth patterns of your grass. Walk out on your land      and mark plants that have just been grazed, then watch to      see what happens to them. Check their growth rate      periodically and take notice of how soon-and how      often-they're rebitten. Are animals selectively      chewing their favorite plants to the ground while letting      the "weed" species take over? Are they wearing some areas      out while letting others grow out of control? If so, you      could probably profit from using HRM.    </p>    <h3>      GOOD FENCES MAKE GOOD GRASSLANDS    </h3>    <p>      Obviously, in order for HRM to work, there must be some way      to keep your animals where you want them at any given time.      Taking the cue from Voisin's pioneering work, commercial      ranchers employing HRM regulate the timing and      concentration of their stock with fences. But these days,      the fences are often electric and frequently strung in a      wagon-wheel pattern around central watering and handling      facilities.    </p>    <p>      In fact, the wagon-wheel pattern of fencing has become      something of a symbol of HRM... much to Allan Savory's      dismay.    </p>    <p>      "It's a handy technique for concentrating animals and      timing their grazing on a commercial ranch," Savory      explains, "but too many people build wagon-wheel grazing      cells and then ignore the concepts that make such a system      work. Illiterate tribal herders have successfully used the      concepts of HRM <em>without</em> fences, while elaborately      fenced university demonstrations have failed because      scientists thought that the fence was the whole idea; they      used the fences to make an inflexible rotation system, and      ignored the varying growth rates of plants until      overgrazing caught up with them."    </p>    <h3>      A CASE IN POINT    </h3>    <p>      Although the academic agricultural community remains      largely skeptical, practical experience indicates that,      properly used, the HRM idea does work. Take the case of the      Barlite Ranch near Marfa, Texas.    </p>    <p>      In the summer of 1983, the Marfa area was suffering a      tenacious drought. Barlite managers Charles and Katie Guest      had 1220 head of cattle on 47,000 acres of increasingly      brown land. Things were looking so bad that they were ready      to spend $40,000 to graze half their stock on irrigated      rental pasture... a last-ditch attempt to minimize losses.      Many neighboring ranchers were forced to sell stock and use      the proceeds to buy hay in order to keep their own      operations going.    </p>    <p>      But a closer inspection of the Barlite land showed that      enough perennial forage plants existed to support the herd      if each square yard could be induced to grow just a      half-ounce of feed. So rather than move part of their stock      to irrigated pasture-and since they already had a      wagon-wheel fencing arrangement-the Guests opted to      give HRM a try.    </p>    <p>      Normally, the Guests split their herd for grazing in seven      wagon-wheel-shaped cells, with each cell further divided      into 13 to 16 "paddocks," or smaller enclosures. Each      seventh of the herd was rotated through its own set of      paddocks. With HRM, the Guests combined their animals into      one <em>huge</em> herd, which they rotated through all 101      paddocks, one paddock at a time.    </p>    <p>      "I didn't think you could run 1,200 cattle together and      move them every day," Charles later remarked. "But they      were so used to the fences already, they pretty well moved      themselves... at least until calves started dropping. That      did cause a little extra work; we had to let new mothers      lag a few paddocks behind the rest of the herd."    </p>    <p>      To see how the HRM experiment worked out for the Guests,      let's look at the numbers:    </p>    <p>      Texas grass in drought time may need 60 days or more of      rest before it's ready to be grazed again. To schedule this      much rest in a single 13- to 16-paddock cell, as the Guests      had been doing previously, a small herd had to spend four      to five days in each paddock. That's 15 rest days for each      day of grazing.    </p>    <p>      But one large herd rotating through 101 paddocks meant a      day or less spent in each paddock, and <em>100</em> days'      rest.    </p>    <p>      Finally, during October and November, the Barlite Ranch      received a total of 1.5 inches of drizzle. Charles Guest      estimated that the precious moisture grew an incredible 21      million pounds of feed on the Barlite's HRM-managed land,      allowing him to carry his herd through the winter on half      the usual amount of purchased supplements... as well as      enabling him to buy 208 cow-calf pairs at distress prices.    </p>    <p>      And as a bonus, the deer and antelope that used the Barlite      pasture also looked better than ever. So did the ranch's      bank account, which had been fattened by saving the $40,000      planned for rental pasture and the $26,000 that would have      gone for supplemental feed.    </p>    <h3>      ON A SMALLER SCALE. . .    </h3>    <p>      Another HRM convert is Esquipula Chavez, an elderly Indian      stockman and governor of Sandia Pueblo, New Mexico.      Chavez's problem of trying to make a living running 150      head of poor cattle on poor range was compounded by      pressure from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to cut the      number of animals even further.    </p>    <p>      Finally, as an alternative to reducing the size of his      herd, the BIA helped Chavez build an uncomplicated      nine-paddock cell equipped with central handling      facilities. Savory helped Chavez work out maximum and      minimum grazing periods for each paddock, and Chavez, a      close observer of plant life, varies rotation from paddock      to paddock according to the growth rate of his grass.    </p>    <p>      "It works," the Native American rancher says with a smile.      "And in addition to improving production, HRM has also      reduced my work load. Before, I saw my cows only at      handling time, and then it took all my relatives three days      of work just to round them up and bring them in. Now I see      my animals every day, and can run them through the center      and brand or vaccinate the whole herd in one afternoon."    </p>    <h3>      CURES THAT KILL    </h3>    <p>      Typical symptoms of overgrazing in the West include      invasions of sagebrush, snake-weed, leafy spurge,      piñon pine, and similar nonfood plants. Traditional      cures-destocking the range, killing the weeds with      defoliants, bulldozing the country flat, planting hybrid      grasses, and applying commercial nitrate      fertilizer-treat only the symptoms.    </p>    <p>      As an example of this sort of big-budget thinking, Wyoming      is just winding up a six-year, $7.3 million program of      spraying Tordon (a commercial variant of Agent Orange) on      millions of acres of leafy spurge.    </p>    <p>      Besides the outright danger of such drastic approaches to      grasslands management, leafy spurge isn't even the      <em>problem</em> , according to the holistic view. The      problem is succession: Where the natural relationship      between plants and animals is altered, Mother Nature lets      weeds invade.    </p>    <p>      A typical brush-clearing operation can cost a rancher (or      the taxpayers, if it's done on public land leased to a      rancher for grazing livestock) $150 an acre, and it's only      a short-term fix. In contrast, say HRM practitioners, even      the most sophisticated electric-fenced grazing cell can      restore the same acre <em>permanently</em> for $5, while      simultaneously doubling the allowable stocking rate.    </p>    <h3>      IN THE FINAL RECKONING    </h3>    <p>      We can't really blame our ancestors for ruining the land...      they didn't know they were doing it until the harm was      done. And we can't blame those who espouse the traditional      methods of rangelands management while criticizing HRM,      even though the old ways haven't worked and HRM promises      to; resistance to change often helps weed out fly-by-night      schemes that could send us off on wild, wasteful tangents.    </p>    <p>      But many feel that Allan Savory is right, that the time for      change has come, and that HRM holds the key to a more      naturally balanced, productive ranching future.    </p>
