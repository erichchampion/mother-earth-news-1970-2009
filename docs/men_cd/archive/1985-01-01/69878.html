                    <p>      <em>If you love the feel of winter wind on your cheeks but      don't want to spend your last cold dime...</em>    </p>    <hr />    <h5 id="byline">     by Michael Rutter    </h5>    <p>      When most of us think of a winter vacation, we dream of      sunny tropical islands with white sand and gentle breakers.      When Jim Philips headed off on his snow season voyage,      though, he went several hundred miles above the Arctic      Circle ... to a deserted place on the frozen ice north of      Point Barrow, Alaska.    </p>    <p>      To make this "dream trip" more unusual, Jim Philips didn't      dress in the latest cold-weather wear from L.L. Bean or      Eddie Bauer. Instead, he and his father wore winter      clothing (and even used sleeping systems and mukluks) that      they developed and made for under $100!    </p>    <p>      The pair started to design their own clothing when Jim was      a boy. "When I was in Boy Scouts," Jim says, "I could      barely afford what was offered on the market for winter      camping. Then, when I <em>did</em> spend a lot of money on      something that was supposed to be 'winterproof' and it      didn't do the job, I was so disappointed that I decided to      make some gear myself."    </p>    <p>      Jim adds that he didn't just get out of bed one day and      decide to go camping on the polar ice cap. In fact, that      expedition was the ultimate challenge after years of      testing. Previously, Jim and his father had camped in      subzero temperatures at 13,000 feet in the Colorado Rockies      and in blizzards on the infamous Mount Washington in New      Hampshire, to name a couple of chilly spots.    </p>    <p>      I asked Jim how he could stay warm without the standard      equipment that seems so essential to winter survival.      Immediately he corrected me. "Survival," he said, "is the      wrong word. I prefer to use the word <em>living</em> in      reference to arctic conditions. A person can      <em>survive</em> but be uncomfortable, perhaps get      frostbitten and lose limbs. That's not good enough for me.      You should be able to stay warm and not suffer adverse      effects. The clothes I've developed aren't fancy, but they      work because they insulate, they breathe, and they're      practical."    </p>    <p>      Making cozy-in-the-cold clothing like Jim's is both easy      and inexpensive. You need no special tools or sewing skills      for the job. Just gather up a 4' X 8' piece of 1" supersoft      polyurethane plastic foam (foam rubber and other      substitutes will not work), a <em>very</em> large shirt and      pair of pants, a sharp knife, a supply of Velcro strips,      and an aerosol can of urethane glue.    </p>    <p>      One-inch foam can be purchased from an upholstery supply      store for about 30 cents a linear foot. This is the ideal      thickness for living and working in subzero temperatures      and is recommended for the pants and torso sections of your      clothing. You can use thinner foam, 5/8" or 3/4", for the      arms.    </p>    <p>      Be sure that the shirt and pants are at least four or five      sizes larger than you normally wear and made of a fabric,      such as double-knit polyester, that doesn't absorb water.    </p>        <h3>      ARE YOU READY?    </h3>    <p>      Using Fig. 1 as a rough guide, cut the pants from a single      piece of large foam with a sharp knife (a dull blade grabs      and pulls the foam). Use long sweeping motions to make      clean, smooth cuts; cut the foam bigger than necessary,      then trim to fit your needs. The belt-line should be 6"      larger than the normal size. (The drawing gives the      measurements for a man with a 36" waist.) No matter what      size legs you have, cut the foam legs 17" wide. A little      creative customizing will probably be necessary to see that      the foam fits both the pant and your leg.    </p>    <p>      You will also need to sew or glue a patch of reinforcing      cloth-about 6 inches square-at the crotch to      prevent tearing. (The top of the crotch should be in the      center of the patch.) A glue specifically made for urethane      foam can be purchased from the upholstery supply, or you      can use 3M Fast Tack Trim Adhesive, found in auto parts      stores.    </p>    <p>      To put the parts together, simply roll up the foam legs and      insert them inside the pant legs. With both foam legs in,      you will have a pair of pants that will almost stand by      themselves!    </p>    <p>      The shirt of this Eskimo-like outfit consists of the torso      and the arms, all held in place by Velcro strips. (Velcro      is usually sold by the foot at camping stores.) These can      be glued on with the urethane glue at the abdomen and on      each shoulder. The torso size shown in Fig. 2 should fit      most adults, but as with the pants, you'll probably need to      modify it some to fit your individual frame.    </p>    <p>      After you cut out the arms (see Fig. 3), roll them up and      put them inside the sleeves of the shirt. Then wrap the      foam torso around you and hook the Velcro strips that hold      the torso piece in place. Now put the shirt on, and you're      ready to go!    </p>    <h3>      WARM ADVICE    </h3>    <p>      For best results, the foam should be worn right      <em>next</em> to your skin. Also, you may want to use      suspenders to help keep the pants up.    </p>    <p>      If you have foam left over, make bun and knee pads. These      are slipped in between the pants and the foam liner to give      added warmth, in case you do any kneeling or sitting on the      snow.    </p>    <p>      To keep your feet frostbite-free, Jim recommends using an      old pair of Moon Boots or waders. Cut off the uppers,      leaving only the soles, then sew on a cloth upper and wrap      your feet in foam. Without socks you can be warm in weather      as cold as 60° below-right down to your toes. Jim      has used the same foam and a nylon shell to make mittens      and even an arctic parka (which he made from an old Penny's      jacket he bought at a garage sale for $2.00).    </p>    <p>      So, as you can see, with these simple materials you can      make everything you need in order to live      <em>comfortably</em> at extremely cold temperatures. All      that padding may make you look like an overstuffed Santa      ... but you'll be a warm one!…    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The folks here at MOTHER have not had a      chance to try these clothes (at this writing, we're still      waiting for our first frost!), so we recommend that you      test them yourself on short outings before venturing out on      a full winter expedition.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Jim Philips runs a school that teaches arctic living,      winter camping, and cold-weather survival firsthand.
