                    <p>      <em>Are you thinking of reducing the amount of meat in your      diet, or just looking for a tasty alternative to beef and      potatoes? You'll find some help in MOTHER's      mini-manual.</em>    </p>        <h3>      Jeanne Malmgren Cameron    </h3>    <p>      A person has only to browse through the cookbook section in      any local bookstore to conclude that vegetarianism can no      longer be considered a fad, as it was only ten years ago.      With the fitness phenomenon reaching an all-time peak, more      and more people are searching for a more healthful diet . .      . and for many, that means cutting back on meat, or even      eliminating it from their table. Furthermore,      vegetarianism-be it full- or part-time-has also      received the nod from the American Dietetic Association,      the National Cancer Institute, and the American Heart      Association.    </p>    <p>      But just how practical is a vegetarian diet, anyhow? As      more and more folks join the ranks of "rabbit-food      munchers," it becomes essential to dispel the myth that      vegetarian food consists largely of carrots and lettuce.      The majority of people who eschew meat altogether fall into      the <em>lacto-ovo</em> vegetarian slot: They eat a variety      of grains, nuts, beans, fruits, and vegetables, as well as      eggs and all dairy products. A little more strict are the      <em>lacto</em> vegetarians, who eliminate eggs from the      above list. The real hard-liners are the vegans (pronounced      VEH-jun), or "pure" vegetarians, who consume no animal      products at all.    </p>    <h3>      NUTRITIONAL CONCERNS    </h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, a good many folks who might otherwise dive      wholeheartedly into a low- or no-meat diet (for reasons of      health, ecology, economics, ethics, or whatever) hesitate      out of fear that they won't be able to provide their bodies      with the necessary vitamins and minerals on a vegetarian      regimen. And some people-particularly those with      hearty appetites-quail before the question of what to      eat in place of the familiar meat, fish, and poultry. (The      popular image of an anemic wisp of a person munching on      sprouts and nuts dies hard!)    </p>    <p>      However, these worries can be laid to rest. The basic      vegetarian diet is a totally healthful way of eating, one      that offers the body a full array of vitamins and minerals      and ample caloric energy to keep the human machine humming      along.    </p>    <p>      And you have only to glance through the pages of vegetarian      cookbooks to be assured that you'll eat handsomely on      nonmeat fare. Vegetarian cookery is a rich and varied      cuisine, full of marvelous dishes that suggest a whole new      style of, and reverence for, eating. Most folks who make      the transition to vegetarianism find that, rather than      feeling <em>limited</em> by their new diet, they're      actually overwhelmed with the spectrum of tasty meal      possibilities.    </p>    <h3>      THE BASICS    </h3>    <p>      Back in elementary school, we all memorized the famous Four      Food Groups, representing those categories said to be      necessary for a well-balanced diet. Basically, that was      sound advice, and it needs only slight modification to be      applicable to a meatless diet. From <em>Laurel's      Kitchen</em> (see the accompanying source list), here's an      updated and revised version of the Four Food Groups, which      offers a varied and safe way to nourish the body without      including meat: [1] vegetables (yellow and leafy green),      [2] fruits, [3] dairy products and eggs, and [4] grains,      legumes, nuts, and seeds. Choosing three or more servings      every day from each of these divisions will ensure the      lacto-ovo vegetarian a supremely healthy diet. For a      <em>vegan</em> regime, in which the dairy food/egg category      is not used, it's necessary to combine plant foods      carefully in order to ensure adequate protein intake.    </p>    <h3>      A COMPLEMENT A DAY    </h3>    <p>      <em>Protein</em> is probably the biggest bugaboo faced by      the potential or neophyte vegetarian. But not to worry.      Getting one's adequate share of daily protein is no problem      for the conscientious vegetarian, even for the vegan. In      fact, ensuring that you consume enough protein every day is      now generally considered to be even <em>easier</em> than it      was ten years ago.    </p>    <p>      But first, why is protein so important? Aside from water,      protein is the most plentiful substance in the human body      and is vitally important for building muscles, skin, hair,      nails, and internal organs. Protein-a complex of      carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and usually      sulfur-is also an important ingredient in hemoglobin      (the substance that carries oxygen in the blood) and in      antibodies, as well as in the production of enzyme and      hormones.    </p>        <p>      We can't, however, obtain protein directly from the food we      eat. Rather, we must collect the 22 amino acids that serve      as its "building blocks," so that the body can manufacture      its own protein supply. All but eight of those 22 acids are      present in the body, and those eight are therefore labeled      "essential" (since they have to come from the food we eat).      The essential amino acids are isoleucine, leucine, lysine,      methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and      valine. (Children require an additional one, histidine.)      Unless all eight are present in the system at the same      time, no synthesis of protein can take place . . . and      herein lies the major difference between a meat-centered      and a plant-based diet. Animal foods already contain all      the necessary building blocks for protein: They are      "complete" proteins. Plant foods, however, with the notable      exception of the soybean, are "incomplete"      proteins-low in one or more of the eight essentials.      It's obvious, then, that anyone who eliminates meat from      his or her menu must make certain that the plant foods are      augmented in some way to make complete proteins. And that's      done through the principle of protein complementarity,      first brought into the limelight in this country with the      publication of Frances Moore Lappé's now familiar      <em>Diet for a Small Planet.</em>    </p>    <p>      The process of protein pairing involves serving together      foods that have complementary amino acid makeups. That is,      each partner's strengths make up for the other's      weaknesses. For example, grains generally contain very      little isoleucine and lysine, so their obvious protein      "buddies" would be legumes, which are moderately high in      isoleucine and <em>very</em> high in lysine. On the other      hand, legumes are low in tryptophan and methionine . . .      giving them an amino acid profile that's the      <em>opposite</em> of that of most nuts and seeds. Dairy      products are especially high in the very amino acids      lacking in cereal grains, providing another beneficial      pairing. Based on these principles of complementarity,      three important combinations of foods should be kept in      mind (and used every day!) by anyone practicing a meatless      diet:    </p>    <p>      <strong>[1] Grains + Legumes,<br />      (2] Legumes + Nuts or Seeds,<br />      [3] Dairy Products + Grains.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The lesson of protein complementarity, then, is a required      course for any vegetarian cook (in fact, it usually      occupies several pages in the front of most modern meatless      cookbooks) . . . but the good news is that it's easier to      master than you might expect. That's because protein      complementarity has served for centuries as the basis of      many traditional native cuisines around the world and is      even present in some of our common American dishes.    </p>    <p>      For example, beans and corn (served in the form of      tortillas with beans, or bean-filled enchiladas) are a      South American staple, black beans and Cuban rice are a      <em>plat national</em> all over the Caribbean, and lentils      and rice-in countless variations-are served      daily in India. The Orientals, too, have long known about      protein complementarity; they combine soybeans (usually in      the form of curd, or tofu) with rice throughout China,      Japan, and the rest of Asia. Indonesians commonly serve      tempeh (fermented soybean cakes) with their rice. In the      Mediterranean, native peoples feast on specialties      combining garbanzo beans and sesame seeds. Closer to home,      the American Indians taught the early colonists to eat      succotash (a tasty mixture of lima beans and corn). . . and      our modern standards include cereal-and-milk breakfasts,      peanut butter or cheese sandwiches for lunch, and dinners      of pizza (wheat crust and cheese topping) or macaroni and      cheese.    </p>    <p>      So you can see that ensuring a healthy daily allowance of      protein is really no problem for the vegetarian. Yet the      questions remain: How much protein do we really need, and      what proportions are necessary to successfully balance the      amino acids in complementary foods? Debatable issues, both      . . . but there is a margin of error within which a      non-meat eater can feel perfectly safe. The amount of      protein a person requires is determined by his or her body      size, age, sex, and levels of activity and stress. The      general rule of thumb-as specified by the National      Research Council's Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)-is      that we should receive 10-15% of our total energy needs      from protein... or about 0.424 grams per pound of body      weight each day. Thus a 150-pound person would need 63.6      grams of protein daily.    </p>    <p>      It's widely suspected that the government's RDA's for some      nutrients-most notably protein-are at least      slightly exaggerated. Therefore, some nutritionists advise      that it's wise not to become too alarmed over the matter of      protein intake in a vegetarian diet. Instead of anxiously      trying to compute your daily grams, Frances Lappé      suggests that you learn to "read" your own body and notice      whether it's carrying on its normal maintenance functions      properly. How do your hair and fingernails look? Do minor      wounds and sores heal quickly? Do you have enough energy to      carry you through a normal day? If so, you're most likely      receiving plenty of protein. During times of stress or      under special physical conditions, however, the body's      protein "appetite" increases (as metabolic processes      accelerate). . . so the daily requirement is upped      accordingly. A pregnant woman, for example, needs 30 extra      grams of protein a day, while a lactating mother requires      20 extra grams. Babies and children under four years of      age, according to the RDA of the U.S. Food and Drug      Administration, need 28 grams of protein daily.    </p>    <h3>      VITAMINS AND MINERALS    </h3>    <p>      What about vitamins and minerals, though? Can the      vegetarian diet substitute adequately for the important      nutrients found in animal products? This often raised      question tends to overlook the fact that most of the      vitamins and minerals Americans consume come from the very      plant foods that star in a vegetarian diet! Vegetables      provide us with lots of vitamin A, vitamin C, folacin,      riboflavin, and calcium. Fruits, of course, are nature's      storehouses of vitamin C, as well as vitamin A and natural      fiber... while grains and legumes contribute a      <em>long</em> list of nutrients, including protein,      carbohydrates, thiamin, niacin, vitamin E, iron, zinc, and      magnesium. Even so, several important nutrients are often      mentioned as matters of concern when meat is eliminated      from the diet: calcium, the B vitamins, iron, and zinc.      However, if the meatless diet includes dairy products,      there is absolutely <em>no</em> danger of coming up short      on those elements... and even the pure vegetarian diet can      score well with just a little care and planning. In fact,      one of the beauties of a <em>vegan</em> regime is that it      helps restore the body's normal alkaline state (meat is a      very acid-forming food) and thus actually <em>reduces</em>      the need for base minerals, such as calcium. By receiving      enough sunlight (to aid calcium absorption) and eating      abundantly of dark, leafy greens and soy foods, even the      vegan needn't have any calcium worries.    </p>    <p>      The only B vitamin of notable concern to vegetarians is B      12 (cyanocobalamin). Although humans need B 12 in very      small amounts (the adult RDA is 3 micrograms), the vitamin      is not widely available in plant foods, so the strict      vegetarian must find special sources of B 12 . If dairy      products are not included in the diet, a person may choose      to get his or her B 12 from fermented soy foods (tempeh      cakes or miso paste), nutritional yeast (a powdered      supplement often used to make mock cheese), or spirulina (a      blue-green microalgae now available-for rather high      prices-in powder or tablet form). Of course, vitamin      B 12 supplement pills are also available to the vegan and      usually have to be taken only once a week.    </p>    <p>      Iron is another element that's commonly thought to be      available only from flesh foods . . . but it is contained      in plants, although in a form not as readily assimilated by      the body. To ensure adequate iron intake, the vegetarian      can eat lots of iron-rich foods (legumes, dark, leafy green      vegetables, dried fruit, and molasses)... supplement these      with vitamin C (from any citrus fruit) to enhance iron      absorption . . . and use cast-iron cookware.    </p>    <p>      Fruits and vegetables, it's true, are generally poor      suppliers of zinc, a trace mineral that's vital to      enzymatic metabolism and reproductive functions. However,      most whole grains and legumes (both of which play prominent      roles in the vegetarian diet) provide ample amounts of      zinc.    </p>    <h3>      PAIRING UP IN THE KITCHEN    </h3>    <p>      We've already explored the nutritional basis of protein      complementarity; now let's examine the practical side of      the matter. In other words, how in the world do you get all      those little amino acids lined up in proper pairs when      you're rushing to get dinner on the table? Just keep in      mind those three basic combinations: grains with legumes,      nuts or seeds with legumes, and dairy products with grains.      Using those guidelines as a point of departure, you're      limited only by your culinary imagination. Here are some      suggestions to get you started.    </p>    <p>      In the grains plus beans category, an easy booster is two      tablespoons of crunchy soy grits (cracked, partially cooked      soybeans.) added to each cup of flour used in a recipe. Or      try a rice-bean casserole, split pea soup served with whole      wheat or rye bread, a lentil or bean curry served over      rice, or corn tortillas with a refried-bean topping.    </p>    <p>      For the nuts or seeds plus legumes combination, you can      sprinkle sesame salt over a bean casserole, put it in a      garbanzo-carrot stew, or try making hummus (the Middle      Eastern sandwich spread of mashed chick-peas and sesame      meal). A similar Mediterranean delight is falafel ... a      hummus-like dough that's shaped into balls, deep-fried, and      served on whole wheat pita bread.    </p>    <p>      Dairy products and grains are another happy match in the      world of protein pairing and probably offer the easiest      combination to work with. By simply adding two tablespoons      of nonfat dry milk to one cup of wheat or rye flour, you'll      increase the dish's protein quality by 45%! You can also      rely on macaroni and cheese, cereal and milk, rice-milk      pudding, cheese sandwiches, barley and yogurt soup, or      cheese and rice pilaf.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the three major complementary groups, other      beneficial pairings include grains with nuts or seeds      (whole wheat bread with tahini-sesame meal-or      peanut butter)... dairy products with legumes (how about a      cheese sauce over cooked garbanzos?)... or even grains with      yeast (include a little nutritional yeast in bread dough or      pancake batter, or sprinkle it on cereals and popcorn).      Sesame seeds and Brazil nuts, by the way, are both high in      methionine, the amino acid most lacking in dark, leafy      greens... so sprinkle some over your next batch of steamed      collards or kale for a taste <em>and</em> protein treat!    </p>		<h3>SOY FOODS REIGN SUPREME</h3>    <p>      Surely a meatless cook's best friend is the soybean: Humble,      trustworthy, and incredibly versatile, the little rotund      legume is a joy to have around and to work with. Soy foods      have been venerated in the cuisines of the Orient for      thousands of years, but they've been "discovered" in      Western kitchens only in the past 15 years or so, despite      the fact that the United States produces two-thirds of the      world's soybeans. Containing 35% protein by dry weight      (more than any other unprocessed plant or animal food), the      soybean is a nutritious little nugget: It contains no      cholesterol, almost no saturated fat, lots of calcium,      phosphorus, and B vitamins, and an extremely low ratio of      calories to protein. In fact, the amount of usable protein      contained in just one cup of cooked soybeans is equal to      that in a five-ounce steak ... at a cost of only 234      calories!    </p>    <p>      The <em>whole soybean</em> itself can be used in a      multitude of ways, because its bland taste is a natural      "sponge" for almost any spice, herb, or dairy product.      However, even when presoaked, soybeans take a long time to      cook (about three hours by normal methods or 30-40 minutes      in a pressure cooker), so it's best to make a      double-or even triple-batch each time and      freeze the leftovers. After cooking, they can be baked      whole in casseroles (they're especially flavorful with      cheese), added to soups, or stuffed into peppers... or you      might want to mash them and add seasonings to make soy      patties, loaves, cold sandwich spreads, or meatless      "meatballs."    </p>    <p>      <em>Soy flour</em> is another, somewhat "sneakier," way to      enjoy the solid nutritional bonus of soybeans. Simply add      two tablespoons of soy flour to every cup of regular flour      used in a recipe... and you'll have a nice low-fat,      high-protein supplement that won't affect the dish's taste.      (Soy flour is not normally used as the sole flour in bread      making, since it contains no gluten, the "elastic" that is      responsible for making the dough rise.)    </p>    <p>      Ah, <em>tofu</em> . This lovely, nutritious soy food has      long graced oriental kitchens, and now it's migrating      westward as well, fast outstripping all other soy foods in      popularity. Sold most commonly in 12- or 16-ounce blocks,      tofu (or soybean curd) is a creamy, low-calorie food that's      packed with protein (which is increased even further when      it's combined with rice or other grains).    </p>    <p>      Next time you're steaming vegetables, pop a few cakes of      tofu right on top and-when they're warmed      through-remove them from the pot and season them with      soy sauce or tamari. You can also broil individual tofu      cakes: Spread a generous layer of dark miso (fermented      soybean paste that's available in health food stores) over      the surface of each one, then place under your oven's      broiler for five minutes... and you'll have a naturally      salty treat.    </p>    <p>      Tofu can also be sliced and lightly fried in oil with a      breading of cornmeal (or any flour you'd prefer),      nutritional yeast, and salt and pepper. Use the browned      tofu slices to create open-faced sandwiches (dressed with      grated carrots, a sliced tomato, chopped onions, sprouts or      lettuce, and spicy mustard), or dunk them into your      favorite fondue or dipping sauce. If the tofu is cut into      long, thin sticks before frying, you can wrap the cooked      morsels in sheets of paper-thin nori seaweed, moisten the      edges to make a seal, and pop them into your mouth as      unusual hors d'oeuvres. Or marinate your tofu in a sauce      that contains tamari, vinegar, and herbs... then fry as      usual.    </p>    <h3>      Cookbooks    </h3>    <p>      <em>While it's impossible to list all of the excellent      vegetarian cookbooks that are on the market these days, the      following selection of standard vegetarian texts should get      you started in developing your own vegetarian cooking      library.

First, press your tofu      between absorbent towels with a cutting board and weight on      top for about an hour. Then slice it into thin pieces or      small cubes, and deep-fry them in 3-4 inches of vegetable      oil until they float to the top and turn golden brown.      Agé has a delicious crunchy texture and can be used      in an almost infinite number of ways, thanks to its firm      shape and low water content (enabling it to absorb flavors      even more readily than regular tofu). You can broil chunks      of agé along with vegetable pieces for a meatless      shish kebab... sauté agé cubes along with      mushrooms, bean sprouts, and grated gingerroot in a      traditional oriental stir-fry ... or use them to "beef up"      a hearty winter stew.    </p>    <p>      The rest of this mini-manual will have more ideas that      should help make venturing into this brave new world of      vegetarian cookery even more worthwhile!    </p>    <h3>      Sumptuous Soybean Repasts      <br />      Barbara Heller    </h3>    <p>      It's hard to find a more healthful (or less expensive) food      than the soybean. This versatile legume-which can be      prepared in a multitude of ways, from soymilk to "ice bean"      desserts to fermented tempeh-is low in starch and      devoid of cholesterol while being high in protein,      minerals, vitamins, and lecithin. The following four      soybean recipes (which have been kitchen-tested in my home      by three hungry men and rated excellent) should help you on      your way to discovering a nutritious, tasty, low-meat diet.    </p>    <h3>      PREPARING THE BEANS    </h3>    <p>      Although the fastest way to cook soybeans (or any other      dried bean) is in a pressure cooker-unsoaked soybeans      will take about 40 minutes at 15 pounds of pressure-I      generally prefer to soak the beans overnight and simmer      them the next evening. I usually cook one or two pounds of      soybeans each week, leaving half of them whole and grinding      up the rest in my food mill. In this way, a single cooking      gives me the basis for a week's meals with a minimum of      effort. I also save and store the nutritious cooking water      for later use in soups, breads, and other dishes.    </p>    <p>      To prepare your beans for cooking, sort through them and      discard any discolored kernels, then rinse them. Presoak      the beans by adding enough water to a pound of soybeans so      that they're covered with two inches of liquid, and store      them in the refrigerator overnight (the beans will nearly      triple in size, so use a big pot).    </p>    <p>      After the legumes have soaked, skim off the film that will      have formed, add a teaspoon of salt (and more water, if      necessary), and bring the pot to a boil. Then reduce the      heat and let the beans simmer until they're tender, a      process that usually takes about three hours. When properly      cooked, the soybeans should squish easily, but if they're      too tender, they'll form a paste when you grind them up.    </p>    <h3>      BARBECUED SOYBEANS</h3>			<p>      4 cups of cooked soybeans (you can substitute other beans      for part of the soybeans or use 1 cup of cooked mixed      vegetables in place of 1 cup of soybeans)<br />      3/4 cup of catsup<br />      1/4 cup of mustard<br />      1/4 cup of molasses<br />      2 tablespoons of brown sugar<br />      1 teaspoon of chili powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder a dash of Worcestershire      sauce    </p>    <p>      To make this high-protein baked bean dish, combine the      beans with the sauce ingredients and bake, covered, in a      loaf pan in a 300°F oven for 2 to 3 hours. (For a      sweeter, less spicy sauce, you might want to omit the chili      powder and increase the sugar to 1/4 cup.)    </p>    <h3>      SOY-VEGETABLE LOAF    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Loaf:</strong><br />      3 to 4 cups of cooked soybeans, ground<br />      2 carrots, grated<br />      1 onion, diced<br />      1/2 pepper, diced<br />      1/2 cup of wheat germ<br />      1/2 cup of bread crumbs<br />      2 tablespoons of soy flour<br />      1 teaspoon of paprika<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder<br />      1/2 cup of yogurt<br />      2 eggs, beaten<br />      2 tablespoons of oil    </p>    <p>      <strong>Topping:</strong><br />      2 teaspoons of molasses<br />      2 teaspoons of catsup<br />      4 teaspoons of mustard<br />      1 teaspoon of curry powder    </p>    <p>      Combine the main ingredients in the order given and place      the mixture in a loaf pan. Drizzle the topping over the      loaf and bake it in a 350°F oven for 45 minutes, or      until firm.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPAGHETTI AND BEANBALLS</strong><br />      2-1/2 cups of cooked soybeans, ground<br />      1/2 cup of wheat germ<br />      3 tablespoons of grated Romano or Parmesan cheese<br />      2 tablespoons of chopped scallions or parsley<br />      2 cloves of garlic, minced (or<br />      1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder)<br />      salt and pepper to taste wheat germ (for coating the      beanballs) butter or margarine spaghetti noodles and your      favorite tomato sauce    </p>    <p>      Mix together the first six ingredients and shape the      resulting dough into 15 to 20 balls about 1-1/2" in      diameter. Coat the balls with more wheat germ and then fry      them in butter or margarine until they're lightly browned,      turning them frequently as they cook. Then drop the      beanballs into your favorite spaghetti sauce and simmer for      10 minutes. Serve over a bed of steaming spaghetti.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOYBEAN-CABBAGE CASSEROLE</strong><br />      1 large cabbage (about 2 pounds), shredded<br />      3 tablespoons of oil<br />      1 tablespoon of soy sauce or tamari<br />      1/2 teaspoon of sugar<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      2 cups of cooked soybeans, ground<br />      1 tablespoon of whole wheat or unbleached white flour<br />      1 egg dash of pepper<br />      1/2 cup of milk butter or margarine    </p>        <p>      In a large skillet, sauté the cabbage in the oil      until it wilts, then add the soy sauce, sugar, <em>and      half</em> of the salt. Cook this mixture, covered, for      another 15 minutes. While that simmers, combine the      soybeans, flour, egg, pepper, and remaining salt, then      gradually stir in the milk. Alternate layers of cabbage and      bean mixture, beginning and ending with the cabbage, in a      greased two-quart baking dish . . . dot the casserole with      butter or margarine . . . and bake it in a 350°F oven      for about an hour.    </p>    <h3>      From the Cookfires of the World    </h3>    <h3>      Judith Klinger    </h3>    <p>      You have to wonder when you see a 95-pound woman carrying a      200-pound load on her back over the Himalayan trails from      dawn to dusk... and be still more amazed to discover that      her body is fueled by rice and dhal. And you may be further      surprised to learn that these simple foods-in the      proper combinations-produce complete proteins,      provide plenty of energy, and lend themselves to so much      variety in preparation that even finicky tastes can be      intrigued and convened.    </p>    <p>      The cookfires of the world offer many techniques for      achieving a healthful diet while slashing food costs. These      include developing new avenues of taste, focusing on foods      in season, relying on low-cost carbohydrates as staple      foods, using nonmeat forms of protein (and for those folks      in transition to a vegetarian lifestyle, serving meat as a      condiment rather than as a main dish), seasoning basic      foods with a wide range of herbs and spices, and utilizing      all leftovers.    </p>    <p>      My family and I used these methods of eating nutritious,      low-cost meals during our backpacking trips to more than      100 countries around the world. Our son, Greg, who was four      years old when we started our ten-month sabbatical,      remembers meals of rice and dhal that he consumed in Nepal      after hiking 14 miles or more in one day... and Laurie, one      year of age at the time, developed an appetite for whatever      came her way. Today, back in a suburban community, our      family spends only $30 to $35 a week on food-$2,500 a      year less than the U.S. average for a family of      four-while actually enjoying a better diet than the      typical American. Here's how it's done.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DEVELOP NEW AVENUES OF TASTE</strong><br />      The primary step in cutting a family's food budget is to      Stretch tastes to include more types of food. In changing      over to a vegetarian diet, you'll be introduced to new and      delicious combinations of edibles. Study the cuisines of      different cultures and look for low-cost staples that can      be adapted to your new way of cooking. Select the unusual      and inexpensive: A fruit cup tossed with unsweetened      coconut (bought in bulk), for instance, offers a special      touch associated with the South Pacific. Bananas-a      staple in the tropics-are often inexpensive in this      country. Try baking and sautéing them, whipping them      into drinks, or drying banana slices for snacks and      brown-bag lunches.    </p>    <p>      Let your crew at home help select countries from which      they'd like to try foods. Huevos rancheros (eggs with spicy      sauce), burritos, and tacos from Mexico are all made with      healthy, inexpensive foods... as are meals of all-vegetable      Indian curries served with rice and sliced cucumbers tossed      with yogurt.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO EVERY FOOD THERE IS A SEASON</strong><br />      In season is the time to buy. (In most countries of the      world, where refrigeration is still a luxury, it is the      only time to buy.) In the United States, we have great      diversity in seasonal shopping, and newspapers often list      the best buys at farmers' markets or similar produce      centers. And, of course, if you're not already raising your      own vegetables, consider picking up a spade. Subsistence      farming is the normal way of life around the globe.    </p>    <p>      For the colder months, don't forget minigardens for      powerfully good eating. Your kitchen can produce impressive      quantities of sprouts-alfalfa, mung, and soybean...      radish, cabbage, lentil, and wheat berry.    </p>    <p>      Canned goods also have seasonal fluctuations. Shop ahead,      filling your larder as distributors seek to get foods out      of the warehouse and off the supermarket shelves to make      way for new harvests. Watch for such items as green beans,      peas, corn, tomato products, frozen fruits and vegetables,      and even nuts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE STAPLE FOODS<br /></strong> Throughout most of      the world, people subsist on a few foods that can actually      be counted on one hand: rice, wheat, or similar whole      grains... corn... and potatoes or other roots and tubers.      Add dried beans and you have the world's least expensive      foods. What's more, these basic edibles require little      processing (they're most nutritious when least processed),      store easily in limited spaces, and lend themselves to a      variety of cooking methods. Let's look at several of them      more closely.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Legumes.</strong> Among the first plants ever      cultivated, beans are still a great bargain. They're rich      in protein, vitamins, and minerals, and when paired with      whole grains, nuts and seeds, or dairy products, they      provide complete proteins capable of replenishing the      body's needs (so that you or the women on the Himalayan      trails can keep going strong). Today, even greater emphasis      is being placed on legumes as pan of the solution for a      hungry world that cannot hope to exist with meat as a      primary protein source.    </p>    <p>      Of all legume dishes, one of the simplest to prepare is      dhal. This Indian standard may be seasoned to suit your      tastes and served over a bed of rice as a nutritious main      dish. The following recipe adds cabbage, a "hardware      vegetable" that's easy to store for long periods of time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DHAL WITH CABBAGE</strong><br />      1 cup of lentils or yellow split peas<br />      1 medium onion, sliced<br />      2 cups (or more) of water or vegetable stock<br />      2 cups of shredded cabbage<br />      1 /4 cup of olive or vegetable oil<br />      1 large onion, chopped<br />      1 clove of garlic (or 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder)<br />      1 small tomato, diced (or 1 tablespoon of tomato      paste)<br />      1 teaspoon of ground cumin<br />      1 teaspoon of turmeric<br />      1/2 teaspoon of mustard<br />      1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon<br />      1/4 teaspoon of ginger<br />      1/4 teaspoon of ground coriander<br />      4 whole cloves<br />      2 tablespoons of lemon juice salt to taste    </p>    <p>      In a saucepan, boil the lentils or peas and the first onion      in the water for about 15 minutes. Next, add the cabbage      and continue cooking until the lentils are soft, adding      more water if needed. Now, in a skillet, heat the oil and      saute the second onion and garlic until they're golden,      then add the tomato and seasonings (except the salt) and      cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.      Add the lemon juice, stir the mixture into the lentils, add      salt as desired, and serve the dhal over steaming-hot brown      rice. Accompany the dish with such condiments as sliced      bananas, cucumbers with yogurt, or chopped tomatoes, green      peppers, and raw onions. This recipe will provide four      portions.    </p>    <p>      Here's another easy-to-prepare legume dish, one that's      popular in the Caribbean.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CUBAN BLACK BEANS AND RICE</strong><br />      1 pound of black or turtle beans<br />      3 cups of water or vegetable stock<br />      1/2 cup of olive or vegetable oil<br />      1 cup of chopped onion<br />      1 clove of garlic, minced<br />      1 green pepper, diced<br />      2 teaspoons of salt<br />      1 teaspoon of ground pepper<br />      1 bay leaf<br />      2 tablespoons of tamari<br />      1/4 cup of wine vinegar hot cooked rice onion and      hard-boiled eggs for garnish    </p>    <p>      Rinse the beans and cover them with water to soak      overnight. The next day, drain the legumes, add about 3      cups of fresh water, and bring to a boil. While they're      cooking, sauté the onion, garlic, and green pepper      in oil, and when tender, add them to the beans along with      the seasonings, tamari, and wine vinegar. Cover the pot and      simmer the mixture until the beans are soft, adding more      water if needed. Serve with hot brown rice and a garnish of      chopped raw onion and sliced hard-boiled eggs. This recipe      provides six generous portions.    </p>    <p>      Another way to use legumes is in sandwich fillings.      Falafel, a Middle Eastern dish, is made by forming a bean      mixture into small balls, deep-frying them, and tucking      them into pita bread.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FALAFEL</strong><br />      4 cups of cooked garbanzo beans (2 cups soaked overnight      and boiled until soft)<br />      1 medium potato, cooked and mashed<br />      1 or 2 eggs, beaten<br />      1 medium onion, finely chopped<br />      2 cloves of garlic, minced<br />      2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons of salt (or more)<br />      1 teaspoon of paprika<br />      1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander or cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin<br />      1/4 teaspoon of black pepper dash of cayenne juice of<br />      1 lemon flour or fine bread crumbs vegetable oil    </p>    <p>      Drain and mash the cooked beans, then combine them with the      potato, egg, onion, garlic, parsley, spices, and lemon      juice. Chill the batter well, then form it into walnut-size      balls and dust each one with flour or bread crumbs. Fry the      rounds in 1-1/2" of hot oil in a heavy skillet until      browned, then drain them on brown paper and serve them      stuffed into pita bread, rolls, or french bread and      garnished with yogurt, chopped tomatoes, and onions or      shredded lettuce and tahini dressing. This recipe will feed      about six.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Whole grains.</strong> In the Western world, we are      just now rediscovering the importance of using whole      grains. This group of foods requires only small additions      of legumes or dairy products to create complete protein      combinations. Serve barley as a side dish, millet as      porridge, and oats not only for cereals and breads but      also-buttered and browned-for crumb toppings.      Rice, perhaps the most universal food, can be served in      main dishes, desserts, and salads.    </p>    <p>      The Japanese call rice <em>go-han</em> , with <em>han</em>      meaning "rice" and <em>go</em> meaning "highest reverence."      This is the staple food for two-thirds of the world's      people. For the most nutrition, rely on brown rice, which      has the germ and most of the bran layer intact. One cup of      brown rice provides 15 grams of protein and 154 grams of      carbohydrate, while one cup of white rice has only about 4      grams of protein and 50 grams of carbohydrate. Brown rice      also has double the iron and triple the calcium, niacin,      and B1 and B2 vitamins, and it's high in phosphorus and      sodium. What's more, brown rice just <em>plain</em> tastes      better!    </p>    <p>      To save time and energy, always make rice in double      batches, then use it in casseroles, egg dishes, salads,      puddings, and stir-fried meals. Fried rice is quick to fix      and unbeatable as a tasty money saver. Vary the dish by      adding onions, shredded carrots, slivered green peppers and      beans, minced cauliflower or broccoli, fresh sprouts, and      thinly sliced zucchini. To turn the rice into a complete      meal, add eggs, tofu, or cheese.    </p>    <p>      Pilaf is served in India and Pakistan for festive      occasions, and can be made with just about any grain. Try      substituting millet, cracked wheat, triticale, or barley in      the following recipe.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BASIC RICE PILAF</strong><br />      1 onion, diced<br />      1/4 cup of chopped mushrooms<br />      1 small carrot, diced<br />      1 stalk of celery or a green pepper, diced<br />      2-3 tablespoons of olive or vegetable oil<br />      1 cup of raw brown rice<br />      2 cups of vegetable stock or water<br />      1 teaspoon of curry powder or a combination of the      following:<br />      1 bay leaf a few cardamom seeds<br />      1/2 teaspoon of turmeric<br />      1/2 teaspoon of ginger<br />      1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder<br />      1/4 teaspoon of cumin<br />      1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon<br />      4 whole cloves<br />      1/2 cup of chopped peanuts, pine nuts, sunflower seeds, or      almonds<br />      1/2 cup of raisins, currants, or other dried fruit<br />      1 teaspoon of salt    </p>    <p>      Sauté the vegetables in the oil. When they're      tender, add the rice and stir over moderate heat until the      grains are dry. Then add the spices (except the salt) and      the vegetable stock, cover, and cook for 20 minutes over      low heat. Sprinkle in nuts, dried fruit, and salt and cook      10 minutes more. Check the seasonings, adding more salt if      desired, and fluff just before serving. To make pilaf a      main dish, melt cheese over the top or serve it with beans      or a yogurt salad.    </p>    <h3>      Tofu: Press It, You’ll Like It    </h3>    <h3>      Helen Prescott    </h3>    <p>      What food contains more protein than an omelet, more iron      than spinach, and as much calcium as cottage      cheese-all for as little as 25 cents per homemade      pound? You guessed it: tofu. When my family was introduced      to this oriental import, it was love at first bite. We were      soon feasting on scrambled tofu for breakfast, sipping tofu      shakes with lunch, enjoying bean curd burgers for dinner,      and savoring slices of soy cheesecake for dessert.    </p>    <p>      However, with the nearest health food store some 30 miles      away and our favorite food selling for $1.30 a pound, it      wasn't long before our appetites outdistanced our      pocketbooks. Necessity demanded that we make our own tofu,      so for a few weeks I diligently mashed, boiled, strained,      and curdled the soybeans... and usually came up with only a      pound of bean curd to show for several hours' work. The      results were tasty, though, and rather than becoming      discouraged by our small return, we were all the more      determined to make the process economically feasible.    </p>    <p>      The answer to our predicament was a homemade wooden press      that can hold as much as 15 or as little as 2 pounds of soy      cheese at one time. This efficient device enables me to      strain the initial soymilk-and-mash mixture and to press      the bean curd while the liquid is still near boiling, thus      speeding up the tofu-making operation and sparing me some      burned fingers and spilled whey. The press cuts down on the      waste of useful by-products, as well: Since the bottom edge      of the contraption fits snugly over a large basin, it's an      easy matter to save the whey for use in baked goods, soups,      or pet food. And when the tofu is firm, the front panel of      the press lifts out to let the curd be cut and removed      easily. What's more, the implement cost us only about $5.00      in materials and took a mere two hours to construct . . .      and it saves us more than a dollar per pound of tofu each      time we use it.    </p>    <h3>      BUILDING THE PRESS . . .    </h3>    <p>      To make a tofu press, you'll need an assortment of pine      lumber and plywood (our design requires 5' of 1 X 6 pine      board for the sides, a 1' section of 1 X 12 pine board for      the lid, and a 12-1/2" X 13-1/2" piece of 1/4" plywood for      the base)... 18 to 20 No. 6 X 1-1/4" rustproof wood      screws... a drill with 1/8", 9/64", and 3/16" bits... a      circular saw or a handsaw... a chisel... a screwdriver...      some sandpaper... and enough vegetable oil to coat the      finished product.    </p>    <p>      First off, you'll need to decide what you'll be using to      catch the soymilk and whey as they strain through the      press, because it's best to make that container a permanent      part of your tofu operation. The catching vessel should      hold at least five gallons of liquid and be able to      withstand temperatures up to 212°F. Our press is      designed to fit snugly over a stainless steel basin that      sits in our kitchen sink. Whatever container you      choose-whether it's a plastic tub, large bucket,      enameled canning pot, or similar vessel-you'll want      to design your press so that two of its sides hang several      inches over the edge of your catching pot, while the      perforated bottom rests almost an inch below the top. (This      design prevents the press from sliding off center and      splashing out boiling liquid.)    </p>    <p>      Once you've calculated the size of your press, cut the two      sides out of the 1 X 6 pine board (ours measure 16-1/2" in      length). At each end of the side sections, cut out a small      rectangle 3/4" up from the base and 2" in from the sides.      Directly in from this indentation, cut a 3/4 "-wide      vertical slice 1/4" into the panel, as shown in the      drawing. (Because commercial lumber is measured before it      runs through a planer, your 1 X 6 board will actually be      3/4" X 5-3/8". . . which is why the groove is 3/4" wide.)    </p>    <p>      Next, cut the front and back pieces from the remaining 1 X      6 board (ours are 12-1/2" long). These sections should fit      securely into the side grooves. Thoroughly sand all the      pieces and secure the back panel into place with four      screws. The front panel is not screwed in, instead, it      merely rests in the opposite slots so that you can slide it      up and remove the pressed bean cheese with ease.    </p>    <p>      With that done, cut a base from the 1/4" plywood-ours      measures 12-1/2" X 13-1/2"-sand it, and screw it onto      the back and side panels, using four or five fasteners per      side. Next, on the underside of the press, pencil a grid of      3/4" squares 1-1/2" in from each side and drill      holes-using the 3/16" bit-at each crossing to      allow for drainage. Then sand the board again, making sure      to remove any loose chips in the holes.    </p>    <p>      Now measure to determine the appropriate size for the      cover. The lid should slide easily down into the press to      help squeeze out extra liquid, so leave about a l/8"gap on      each side between the panels and the cover (our lid      measures 10-3/4" X 11-3/4"). Cut the "cap" from the 1 X 12      pine board and sand it smooth.    </p>    <p>      Choose a scrap of wood to form a handle for the lid. We      used a coping saw to shape an elegantly curved handle, but      a simple 1" section of 1 X 6 would certainly work. Sand the      handle and attach it to the center of the lid, using two      screws.    </p>    <p>      All that's needed now is a quick coating of vegetable oil      to protect the wood . . . and you're in (the tofu)      business.    </p>    <p>      <strong>. . . AND USING IT</strong><br />      There are probably as many different ways to make tofu as      there are varieties of this creamy soy cheese. William      Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi, authors of <em>The Book of      Tofu</em> , describe visiting hundreds of Japanese tofu      masters, each of whom employed his or her own particular      method of making bean curd. The most widely used method in      this country is what I call the "two-step tofu technique,"      which produces a soy cheese very high in protein. To make 5      pounds of tofu using this method, you'll need 4 cups of      dried whole soybeans, 10 to 12 quarts of water, and 2      tablespoons of nigari (a sea salt derivative used to curdle      the milk) dissolved in 1 cup of water. (You can use other      curdling agents, as well. Nigari forms large curds and adds      extra minerals to the final product, while lemon or lime      juice or cider vinegar makes a softer-and more      tart-cheese. When substituting the juice for the      nigari, use six times the amount called for and don't      dilute it with water. Epsom salts, which can be used in the      same amounts as nigari, is perhaps the least desirable      coagulant, as it gives a slightly salty taste to the cheese      and renders the whey inedible.)    </p>    <p>      Sort the dried beans and soak them overnight in about 12      cups of cold water. Then rinse the beans and puree them in      a blender, using 1 cup of soaked beans to each quart of      water (you can also use a food grinder or processor for      this step, adapting as necessary). Pour the resulting slush      into a large cooking vessel and bring it to a boil. Then      reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring      continually. This is one instance in which it pays to watch      the pot: Soymilk can foam up and boil over very quickly.    </p>    <p>      When the mixture has cooked for the allotted time, situate      your cheesecloth-lined press over the catch container and      pour the hot liquid through. Cover the strained mash, or      <em>okara,</em> with the folds of cloth, place the lid over      it, and push down slowly to force out any excess soymilk.      At this point, you might want to set aside a quart or two      of fresh soymilk (it's especially tasty when mixed with a      teaspoon of honey). Save the okara for later use, too.    </p>    <p>      Now, rinse out the large kettle and return the soymilk to      the pot. Bring it to a near boil, then turn off the heat.      Next, stir the liquid rapidly in one direction, pour in 1/3      cup of the diluted nigari, stir once or twice in the      opposite direction, sprinkle in another 1/3 cup of the salt      mixture, and cover the pot. After 3 minutes, lift the lid      and softly poke the curds to determine if the whey has      completely separated. If the whey is still milky, add the      last 1/3 cup of the solution, stir it briefly, and wait      another couple of minutes.    </p>    <p>      When the milk has completely curdled, pour it slowly      through your cheesecloth-lined press, cover the curds with      the cloth, place the lid on top... and plan on enjoying a      delicious meal of tofu in about four hours.    </p>        <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Suggestions/or serving tofu and other      soy foods can be found in the main article of this      mini-manual. . . and for more detailed recipes, you can      consult the cookbooks given in the source list.

As soon as word got out around the office that      we were doing a meatless mini-manual, various staffers      began bringing in the recipes for their favorite vegetarian      dishes.    </p>    <p>      So, in the spirit of sharing a good thing, here are some of      those offerings, gleaned from various kitchens and      cookbooks.    </p>    <h3>      TAMALE PIE    </h3>    <p>      This recipe is one of those staff-of-life dishes:      Nutritionally, it's an excellent combination of ingredients      that complement one another in proteins, and its rich, full      flavor of beans and corn makes it a family favorite.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Group I:</strong><br />      2 cups of cooked pinto or kidney beans<br />      1 tablespoon of tomato paste<br />      3 tablespoons of water<br />      2 tablespoons of oil<br />      1/2 cup of chopped onion<br />      1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder<br />      1 teaspoon of chili powder<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      1/4 cup of sliced ripe olives<br />      1/2 cup of fresh corn<br />      1/2 green pepper, chopped<br />      1/4 cup of chopped parsley<br />      1/2 cup of chopped celery    </p>    <p>      <strong>Group II:</strong><br />      2-1/2 cups of cold water<br />      1-1/2 cups of cornmeal<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      1/2 teaspoon of chili powder<br />      1/4 cup of grated cheese (or more)    </p>    <p>      Grind the beans in a blender or food mill, combine the      tomato paste with the water, then set these aside while you      sauté the onion in the oil. Combine all the Group I      ingredients and let them cook over medium heat, stirring to      prevent the beans from sticking. Adjust the seasonings to      taste.    </p>    <p>      Next, combine all the ingredients in Group II, except the      cheese, in a heavy skillet, and cook over medium heat,      stirring constantly, until the cornmeal thickens and comes      to a boil. Then spread 2/3 of the cornmeal mixture over the      bottom and sides of a greased 8" X 8" pan . . . pour the      bean mixture into the cornmeal crust... and spread the      remaining cornmeal on top. Sprinkle the top crust with the      cheese and cook in a 350°F oven for 1/2 hour.    </p>    <h3>      GREEN RICE CASSEROLE    </h3>    <p>      This recipe, contributed by one of MOM'S staffers, is      extremely easy to fix and provides a good use for leftover      vegetables.    </p>    <p>      1-1/3 cups of evaporated milk or light cream<br />      1/2 cup of vegetable oil<br />      3 eggs<br />      2 teaspoons of salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon of pepper<br />      1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic<br />      1/2 teaspoon of Italian herbs<br />      3 cups of cooked brown rice<br />      1/4 cup of chopped onion<br />      2/3 cup of chopped carrots<br />      2 bunches of fresh spinach, steamed slightly (or 1 10-ounce      package of frozen spinach, thawed) leftover vegetables      added to taste<br />      3 cups of shredded sharp cheese    </p>    <p>      In a large bowl, beat the milk, oil, and eggs until well      blended, then mix in the seasonings. Next, add all of the      remaining ingredients except for 1 cup of the cheese, and      mix well. Now, transfer the ingredients to a lightly      greased 3-quart casserole dish and place the remaining cup      of cheese on top. Bake at 400°F for 1-1/2 hours.    </p>    <h3>      PERFECT PROTEIN SALAD    </h3>    <p>      This recipe's a favorite with several of MOM'S staffers...      it's good for you as well as good-tasting!    </p>    <p>      3/4 cup of raw soybeans<br />      3/4 cup of raw rye or wheat berries one of each, diced:      scallion, carrot, cucumber, red onion pepper, stalk of      celery<br />      1 cup of cottage cheese    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marinade:</strong><br />      1/2 cup of cider vinegar<br />      1/2 cup of mayonnaise<br />      2 tablespoons of dry white wine juice of 1 lemon or      lime<br />      2 cloves of garlic, crushed<br />      1 teaspoon of fresh fennel or dill<br />      1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard<br />      1/2 cup of freshly chopped parsley dash of basil salt and      pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      Cook the soybeans and rye or wheat berries until tender,      then add them to the marinade and chill the mixture. Add      the diced vegetables, and then combine everything with the      cottage cheese. Serve with alfalfa sprouts and tomato      slices.    </p>    <h3>      SAVORY CHEESE AND ONION PIE    </h3>    <p>      pastry for a 10" pie shell<br />      10 ounces of cheese, grated (1/2 Swiss and 1/2 Gruyere      suggested)<br />      2 tablespoons of flour<br />      2 large onions, sliced<br />      4 tablespoons of butter<br />      1 teaspoon of freshly chopped basil<br />      2 large, firm tomatoes, sliced<br />      2 large eggs<br />      3/4 cup of cream nutmeg (optional)    </p>    <p>      Line a 10" pie dish with your favorite pastry and chill it.      Then toss the cheese with the flour and set it aside. Melt      the butter in a large skillet and sauté the onions      until they begin to turn golden. Spread about 1/3 of the      cheese over the bottom of the pie dish, then layer the      onions on top. In the butter that's left in the pan, heat      the tomato slices with the chopped basil for a minute or      two, then arrange the mixture over the onions, and cover      with the remaining cheese.<br />      Next, beat the eggs with the cream and pour over the      cheese. Sprinkle a little nutmeg on top, if desired, and      bake the pie in a preheated 350°F oven for 35 to 40      minutes, or until the top browns nicely. Serve hot, in      wedges, to six hungry cheese lovers.    </p>        <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The Tamale Pie recipe is reprinted from      Laurel's Kitchen, by Laurel Robertson et al.
