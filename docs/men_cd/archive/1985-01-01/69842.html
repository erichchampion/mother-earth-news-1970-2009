                    <p>      <em>Tired fo wood-heating mess and late-night sojourns to      the woodpile? Maybe you need a...</em>    </p>    <hr />        <h5 id="byline">      by Dan Kozlovsky    </h5>    <p>      If you heat or cook with wood, you're probably well aware      of how handy an easy-to-use and ample woodbox can be.      Without one, wood burning often becomes a messy and tedious      chore. Now, you may already have some ideas about what the      perfect woodbox design is, but how about letting me fill      you in on the details of the wood caddy I built? It takes      up relatively little space, holds the wood handy to the      fire, and controls the spread of chips, bark, and dust.      With the following guidelines, you can vary the size,      shape, and style of my model to suit your fancy, and you'll      be assured of ending up with a handsome and durable piece      of furniture.    </p>    <h3>      MATERIALS AND PREPARATION    </h3>    <p>      This handcrafted wood chest is made from No. 3 pine boards,      available from any lumberyard. I recommend that you use      wide boards-1 X 12's if possible-for the front,      back, bottom, and two end panels; 1 X 2's work well as      trim, battens, and cleats; and rounded-over 1 X 3 stock can      serve for the caps atop the front and back panels. These      are convenient sizes to work with, but the design is      flexible enough that you can really use just about any      lumber you happen to have on hand.    </p>    <p>      The first step is to plan the size and shape of the box to      suit the amount of wood you burn and the length of billet      that your stove or fireplace accepts. Once you've settled      on the basic dimensions, take a few minutes to lay out your      lumber on the floor, so you can arrange for cuts that      eliminate bad knots and make attractive patterns from the      heart-and sapwood.    </p>    <p>      <em>End panels are</em> cut to a length determined by the      height of the box, but you might work in some curves on the      tops and bottoms of the boards to add a bit of flair to the      design. I used paint buckets and inverted bowls as      templates to draw the curves and then cut them on a band      saw (a saber saw would work as well). If you need a box      that's more than 11-1/4" from front to back (the actual      width of a 1 X 12), you'll have to use cleats to hold a      pair of boards together. One cleat toward the top and one      at the height where the bottom will rest are sufficient.    </p>    <p>      The <em>front panel</em> consists of as many vertical,      side-by-side boards as are necessary to achieve the desired      box length. And, of course, the front panel height will be      determined by the height and design of your end panels. Cut      these boards to the proper length, and lay them out on the      floor, so you can figure out the lengths of the trim      pieces, the battens, and the cleat that the bottom will      rest on.    </p>    <p>      Because the front panel butts against the end panels, the      horizontal trim strips must be cut 1-1/2" longer than the      width of the front panel to allow them to overlap the end      panels. The vertical trim and battens fit between the      horizontal trim strips, but you may want to leave a gap of      an inch or two between the bottom trim piece and the floor.      You may have noticed from the photo that I beveled (to      about 15Â°) all my trim strips. This complicates      assembly a bit, but I think it makes the box more      attractive.    </p>    <p>      Make your <em>back panel</em> 1-1/2" wider than the front      one, so it can overlap the end panels. You'll need two      horizontal cleats that are 1-1/2" shorter than the back      panel's width to hold the boards together. The lower will      be the bottom rest. Once again, the height of the end      panels determines the lengths of the 1 X 12's.    </p>    <p>      The box's <em>bottom board</em> is as long as the front      panel-it will fit between the end panels and rest on      cleats-and 3/4" narrower than the end panels. If the      width requires two boards, you'll have to apply cleats to      the bottom to hold them together.    </p>    <p>      Finally, cut two <em>top caps</em> to the length of the      finished box. Plane all the edges of boards that will be      exposed and sand the parts before you begin assembly.    </p>    <h3>      ASSEMBLY    </h3>    <p>      It's easiest to put together each of the main panels first,      and then join them to form the woodbox. During assembly,      remember to drive 4d nails into the wood at a slight angle.      A 4d is 1-1/2" long, which is exactly the thickness of two      layers of one-by lumber. Driving them at an angle (or      clipping off about a quarter inch with wire cutters) will      prevent the points from poking through. Using 3d nails      would avoid this problem, but the smaller fasteners      wouldn't offer much strength. Even with the 4d nails, I      recommend that you use glue on all the joints.    </p>    <p>      Use the 4d nails to secure the cleats to the front and rear      panels. Nail from the back in both cases to hide the      nailheads. If you have a multi-board bottom, apply the      cleats from the underside with more 4d nails.    </p>    <p>      For extra strength, attach the end panel cleats with No. 6      X 1-1/4" flathead wood screws. To prevent the wood from      splitting, drill lead holes in the cleats and boards and      then countersink the cleats so the screwheads will be flush      with the wood's surface.    </p>    <p>      You're now ready for the final assembly, which consists of      joining the end, rear, and front panels to each other and      to the bottom board with 6d nails. (I recommend that you      drill lead holes for all the 6d nails to prevent      splitting.) Begin assembly by fastening the end panels to      the bottom board, and then place this assembly so that the      rear is facing up. Position the back panel on the ends and      bottom, and nail it in place. Now flip the box over and      repeat the procedure with the front panel.    </p>    <p>      With the basic structure secure, you can apply the trim and      battens to the front with 4d nails pounded in from the      back. I put the bottom trim piece on first, followed by the      two vertical sections. Then I placed the top trim piece and      filled in with the battens. (When you're nailing from      behind, it's helpful to hold a block of wood against the      front to keep the pans from moving.) Finally, I affixed      both caps, allowing a slight overhang on the front and rear      of the chest.    </p>    <h3>      FINISH    </h3>    <p>      If you wish, use a nail set to push any exposed nailheads      below the wood's surface, and then fill the depressions      with wood putty. Once this material has set, you can apply      finish. I used three coats of a 50/50 mixture of linseed      oil and polyurethane varnish, which I painted on and      allowed to soak in. Then I removed the excess finish from      the surface with a rag. (Note: Rags used to wipe off oil      are extremely combustible. They should be burned      immediately or stored in an airtight metal container prior      to proper disposal.)    </p>    <p>      When you bring your woodbox into the house, bear in mind      that the National Fire Protection Association recommends      that all combustible objects be kept at least <em>three      feet</em> from the fire. Once it's positioned, fill the      container with seasoned wood. A woodbox shouldn't be used      to dry wood; that's a job better accomplished in an airy      woodshed.    </p>    <p>      Now you can sit back and relax, knowing that you won't have      to make any barefoot dashes to the woodpile tonight. As I      finish writing this, I'm enjoying the crackle of dry locust      that I recently plucked from my wood-box. The billets were      seasoned as fence post tops for at least a hundred      years-now they're almost too good to burn. But darned      if I'm going outdoors to get some other wood to use. Not on      a cold night like this one.    </p>    <p>      Maybe tomorrow . . . if the sun's out.    </p>
