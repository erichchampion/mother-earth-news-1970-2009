                    <p>      <em>It's seed catalog time again! But wait! Before you      order too much or too little, consider...</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">     by Karen Kruschke    </h5>    <p>      This is the time of year when even a hint of warmth sends      us scurrying off to rummage through seed catalogs. With      taste buds aquiver, we spend our evenings planning that      beautiful, vastly bountiful dream of a garden. For many      years, though, <em>my</em> preseason vision refused to turn      into a reality.    </p>    <p>      Typically, I would end up with handsome, healthy, giant,      pampered weeds. And the plants that did manage to beat      those nasty weeds would produce so <em>much</em> that I'd      end up with hundreds of pounds of zucchini, radishes, and      green beans. As a result, dinner during midwinter became an      ongoing source of teasing by the kids.    </p>    <p>      "Bet I can guess what vegetable we're having tonight," they      would chuckle,"... green beans!" (I fooled them once by      serving my lone package of sweet green peas.)    </p>    <p>      But then I began to observe the immaculate, waste-free      gardens of some of our community's senior citizens, and it      occurred to me that something was seriously wrong with my      gardening practices. Here was a group of people who,      despite their advancing age, had tidy plots predesigned to      fulfill their expectations. Their gardens looked like the      seed catalog pictures. What were these people doing that a      younger, more energetic person couldn't manage? I finally      realized that years of experience had taught these      gardeners not only what their limitations were but also how      much to plant of any given crop in order to get the yield      they wanted. This desired amount was based on their liking      for the vegetable ... the amount of time it takes to      nurture, harvest, and preserve it... and the type of space      that was available for both growing and storing the      finished product.    </p>    <p>      This was the kind of planning I had neglected to do. So,      after some research and hard-won experience of my own, I      put together some hints on how to garden efficiently. I've      incorporated many of these into the accompanying chart.    </p>    <h3>      THE PLAN    </h3>    <p>      Planning can be the key to setting up an efficient,      successful garden. A good first step is to make a list of      your family's favorite vegetables and try to determine how      much (fresh and preserved) you will want of each kind in      the months ahead. Use the "How Much You'll Harvest" chart      or your own experience to help you calculate how much of      each crop to grow. Then draw a scale plan of your garden,      marking how far apart mature plants must stand and the      optimal distance between your rows or growing beds. That      way, you'll avoid ending up with overly large amounts of      one or two foods and a disappointing scarcity of others.    </p>    <p>      It is also important to choose varieties of vegetables that      are best suited to the climate in your area, so that      they'll not only be certain to survive but to produce the      best yield possible.    </p>    <h3>      PLANTING MORE IN LESS SPACE    </h3>    <p>      Though at first you may not think you'll have room to grow      as many crops as you'd like, careful organization can give      you larger and more varied harvests than you thought      possible. Gardening the intensive way-using beds, for      instance, instead of rows-will give you a much      heavier crop. You can save time, labor, fertilizer, and      water by compacting those long rows into 4' X 25' beds (or      some other convenient size). You can also increase      yields-or at least avoid going crazy later in the      season, trying to harvest everything at once-by      staggering your garden planting.    </p>    <p>      So this year sharpen up your pencil before you put an edge      on your hoe. A little extra time spent planning can save      you a whole lot of time with your planting later on.    </p>    <h3>      The Savings of Preserving    </h3>    <p>      <em>Preserving your garden's vegetables may or may not be      cost-efficient, and once again it's a question of time      versus money. The following is an actual example of      first-year costs of growing and canning 70 quarts of      tomatoes from a 100-foot row.</em>    </p>		     <p>      <em>According to the example, your cost for a quart of      tomatoes would be $1.04 . . . not counting the value of      your time or the expense of heating the jars. The      equivalent of commercially canned tomatoes costs      approximately $1.16 and contains fewer tomato solids than a      home-canned quart. By the second year, the price of      preserving your homegrown crop will plummet to 44 cents per      quart, since you will already have the canner and canning      jars. (You'll have to spend $1.29 per dozen for replacement      jar lids, though.) Other vegetables may cost more or less      to put up, depending on how you process them and how much      you choose to preserve.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If you choose to freeze your yield, your container      costs will be low: 32 cents per quart (for plastic      containers and bags) the first year, 2 cents each year      thereafter. But you'll need to consider the expense of      buying (if necessary) and operating a freezer. Consult the      following list for the prices and operating costs of      freezers of different sizes.</em>    </p>			        <p>      <em>Freezer manufacturers recommend approximately 6 cubic      feet of freezer space for each family member and as much as      10 cubic feet if the major portion of the foods to be      frozen are home-produced rather than store-bought and      prepackaged. But our experience has shown that 3.8 cubic      feet per person is adequate.</em>    </p>
