                    <p>      <em>Are you beating your brains trying to figure out a good      homestead cash crop for this spring?</em>    </p><hr />        <h5 id="byline">     by Lenny White    </h5>    <p>      For the past few years at our southern Oregon organic      flower farm, we've grown hundreds of flower species and      cultivars that we sell-both fresh and dried-to      florists, supermarkets, businesses, offices, and      individuals. Naturally, we continually seek to maximize the      returns from our limited garden space, so we are always      looking for any crop that is easy to grow and sell. One      such discovery is statice, a plant whose several varieties      are in the genus <em>Limonium</em> .    </p>    <p>      Having also been involved in a vegetable truck farm, we've      had the opportunity to compare dollar yields per acre of      the usual vegetables to those of our flower crops... and      flowers, among them statice, rate much higher than      vegetables in dollars earned. In addition, statice is easy      to grow, is a cinch to sell, and offers little risk because      it's easily dried. In other words, we think it's the ideal      crop for the small-scale grower.    </p>    <h3>      CHOOSING THE SEED    </h3>    <p>      Statice seed can be purchased in single colors or as a      mixture. The best colors, from the viewpoint of customer      preference, are the roses, pinks, blues, apricots, and      purples... with yellows and whites being the least desired.      We plant half of our area in the individual colors and the      other half in a mixture, giving us a usable proportion of      yellows and whites.    </p>        <p>      You'll find that statice seed comes either "clean," called      easy-grow, or still embedded in the dried flower heads,      which we crush as finely as possible with our fingers.      We've grown many strains from a lot of different seed      producers without developing any particular preferences.      However, because some colors are peculiar to particular      strains, we grow small quantities of as many types as we      can find, with the exception of dwarf varieties. These we      avoid, since-as flower sellers-we need plants      with long stems.    </p>    <p>      Seed catalogs may offer annual and perennial types of      statice. <em>Limonium suworowii</em> , for example, is an      annual that produces valuable blooms for dried      arrangements, though it's more fickle to grow than      <em>Limonium sinuata</em> . <em>Limonium lacifolia</em> and      <em>Statice tatarica</em> are both hardy perennials that      produce very airy, delicate blooms for fresh and dried      arrangements, and as fillers, they are often considered      superior to the popular gypsophila. Both of these varieties      are relatively uncommon and in great demand, but they      require a year before the first blooms are produced.    </p>    <p>      <em>Limonium sinuata</em> , on the other hand, blooms its      first year and has a number of attributes that make it our      favorite. First, it withstands frost quite well, thriving      in our garden a month before the last spring frost and      giving blooms a month after the first fall frost. Second,      its very dense, broad-leaved, low foliage helps control      weeds. In fact, it literally smothers them. Third, the long      stems grow from the base of the plant and open their      individual florets slowly, giving the grower a period of a      week or more to cut each bloom in its prime. (Most cut      flowers must be harvested every two days.) Fourth, statice      has no insect enemies and no special requirements other      than rich soil, full sun; and plenty of water. And, fifth,      the plant produces blooms (here in southern Oregon) from      July to November, giving the grower a steady supply from a      single planting.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO PLANT    </h3>    <p>      We start our seeds in an unheated greenhouse about eight      weeks before the last frost date, sowing them very thickly      in a tray filled with 1 inch of commercial potting soil and      covering them with 1/8 inch of potting soil or vermiculite.      Though the germination rate is always good, it varies      somewhat with each variety and color. Therefore, just to be      sure, we always sow many more seeds than we need. As soon      as they're big enough to handle, the emerging seedlings are      transplanted into standard nursery four-or six-packs filled      with potting soil. (Compost can be used, but its high      variability in nutrient proportions, pH, and panicle size      and the presence of weed seeds can make it more trouble      than it's worth.) New transplants are protected from the      sun for two days and then returned to normal light      conditions.    </p>    <p>      In a few weeks, the seedlings are about an inch in diameter      and resemble a lawn weed. We place these in cold frames to      harden for another two weeks before setting them out in the      garden around April 1. In order to take maximum advantage      of the fact that statice has a long period of production,      it's essential that the plants be given an early start.      However, since the statice is planted in the garden long      before the earth warms, we start it out by fertilizing with      a 50/50 mix of blood meal and meat meal, which promotes      both immediate and longer-lasting release of nitrogen until      the soil warms up in late spring.    </p>    <p>      To make the most efficient use of garden space,      fertilizers, compost, and water, we grow statice in raised      beds 5 feet across and 60 feet long. (Since we place the      plants 15 inches apart, with a leeway of 7 inches to the      edge of the path, each bed holds 188 plants.) In this way,      70% of the garden space is used for beds, and the other 30%      is taken up by pathways, which are the width of the rotary      cultivator plus 2 inches, allowing for easy maintenance.      We've also found that using beds minimizes the tendency of      the blooms to fall or bend, as their density allows them to      support one another. Along the edges of the beds, we      construct a simple string fence to keep the flowers from      drooping into the walkways.    </p>    <p>      Watering can be done by overhead methods or by drip      irrigation. Sprinkling the plants from above increases the      chance that the blooms will fall, though this problem is      not severe. Drip irrigation, then, is the perfect solution,      but that, of course, requires extra capital.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO HARVEST    </h3>    <p>      The blooms can be harvested at any time of the day, though      it's best to avoid the afternoon heat if possible. We cut      the stems at ground level and immediately pack the flowers      for sale in units of 10 to 20 stems, keeping the flower      heads grouped together in an attractive bunch. We then cut      the stems to a uniform length with a sharp knife or      clippers... wrap them with a rubber band... and place the      bundles in water out of direct sunlight. Unlike many cut      flowers, statice is actually harmed by being put in      refrigerated coolers. It does best in fresh water in a cool      corner and is among the longest-lasting of all fresh      flowers, remaining beautiful for two weeks or more. To dry      the blooms, hang them upside down in a dark, airy place.      (If placed upright, the flowers will wilt before they dry.)    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO SELL STATICE    </h3>    <p>      From May to November, we grow and sell many varieties of      flowers to many different customers... and they      <em>all</em> appreciate statice. Florists are a source of      information about competition and prices. Some may buy a      substantial amount, but most use too little to make an      extra stop on the delivery route worthwhile. Supermarkets      and farmers' markets are our biggest customers.    </p>    <p>      When we approach a new store, we ask to see the manager or      produce manager... show the prospective buyer a basket of      statice... and guarantee that the store will have to pay      only for what sells. These terms and a beautiful wicker      basket make it easy to get our product in the store. Our      display consists of the basket with a plastic bucket of      water set within and a small sign: "Fresh statice, dry by      hanging upside down, $2.00 a bunch." (If possible, we place      the display by the checkout counter.) Allowing for the      store's markup, that price gives us a gross profit of $1.30      to $1.40 on each cluster sold. We figure on clearing at      least 10 cents a stem. A busy store or florist will buy 500      stems per week, or $200 worth per month, from July through      December. And, lucky for us, the statice sells so well and      lasts so long that we take back less than 1% of our      deliveries . . . and we dry that to sell later.    </p>    <p>      Depending on the type of store and the location of the      display basket, it may be worthwhile to wrap each bunch      individually in green floral paper. This simple marketing      technique can dramatically increase sales in locations      where flowers are likely to be bought as gifts.    </p>    <p>      At the beginning of the season, we're happy to sell flowers      to anyone who wishes to buy. For efficiency, however, we      favor those customers who buy large quantities in a single      delivery... who pay cash . . . and who will buy on a      regular schedule. With a minimum of effort, we soon have      more sales than statice and begin to drop the least      profitable accounts and continue to serve the best ones      throughout the year. There are, of course, our      friends-and friends of friends-who purchase      small amounts directly from us. And if we ever have too      much cut on a particular day, we simply dry it.    </p>    <h3>      PRICES AND YIELDS    </h3>    <p>      Though we normally wholesale fresh statice for 10 cents per      stem, sometimes we discount large cash orders. . .      sometimes we sell to individuals at 12-1/2 cents per stem .      . . and we sell all dried statice at the higher price.    </p>    <p>      As far as yields are concerned, so much depends on the      fertility of the soil and on the weather that the amount      we'll have available is very difficult to predict. We've      harvested 20 stems from some plants and expect to average      over 15 stems per plant. We plan to have one-quarter acre      in statice, and we figure that area will hold 26 beds of      188 plants each. If the plants average 10 stems each, at      10 cents per stem, this plot will produce sales of $4,888.      If the average is 15 stems, we'll reap $7,332. And should      we be lucky enough to harvest as many as 20 stems per      plant, we could expect a yield of around $9,776 worth of      statice.    </p>    <p>      We've seen no vegetable crop that can match these returns      for the space used . . . and no flowers are as easy to grow      and sell as statice!    </p>    <p>      This article was originally published in MOTHER'S <em>An      Array of Gardens</em> .    </p>
