                    <p>      <em>If you have a car, a moderate tool collection, and good      tinkering abilities, why not...</em>    </p><hr />    <p>      If you're anything like the folks here at MOTHER'S      Eco-Village, you're probably swamped with nagging little      chores that require some drilling here, some grinding      there, and a bit of cutting somewhere else. Trouble is, all      these work sites somehow manage to be nowhere near a source      of 110-volt power... so, unless you're particularly fond of      hand-tool labor, you've got to either spring for a portable      generator or resign yourself to a ramshackle existence.    </p>    <p>      Curiously enough, nearly everybody owns-and uses most      every day-a reliable and generous source of      electrical energy without even knowing it: the modern      automobile! Yep, if you drive a car or truck manufactured      between the middle 1960's and the present, it's possible to      modify that machine's charging circuit to make it deliver      110 volts of 20-amp (or greater) DC service at the flick of      a switch. With that amount of power, you'd be able to run      lights, power tools, pumps, resistance-element appliances,      or just about anything that doesn't use an induction (AC      only) motor or a transformer.    </p>		    <h3>      "ALTERNATIVE" ENERGY    </h3>    <p>      Around 1963, you see, the major auto manufacturers started      to equip their products with alternators... which not only      made the cars more reliable, but opened up a whole world of      possibilities to tinker-types like us.    </p>    <p>      Actually, the design of an alternator is somewhat opposite      to that of a generator: Rather than current being extracted      from an armature rotating within a wound stationary field,      an alternator's output is drawn from three stator coils      fixed around a spinning multipole rotor containing the      field windings. This produces high-frequency AC current,      which is then rectified, through diodes, into the direct      current used in automotive charging systems.    </p>    <p>      Now, since an alternator's output voltage increases as its      rotor RPM is boosted, a regulator is included in the system      to sample that output and compare it to a desired reference      provided by a Zener diode. If the output is too great (or      too little), a transistorized circuit controlled by the      Zener adjusts current flow to the field rotor to keep the      alternator's output voltage within acceptable limits      (between 12.5 and 13.5 volts).    </p>    <h3>      TWO SIMPLE CIRCUITS    </h3>    <p>      All that's fine, of course, for charging car batteries...      but we wanted to move on to bigger and better things, so we      turned researchers Dennis Burkholder and Robyn Bryan loose      on a staffer's 1978 Ford pickup to see if they couldn't      coax it into giving up 110 big ones without damaging the      stock equipment. What they came up with is a pretty      ingenious use of about $50 worth of over-the-counter and      junkyard parts... a hookup that comes close to duplicating      the convenience and performance of commercial converters      that are considerably more expensive!    </p>    <p>      The concept is simple enough: By switching the regulator      (and thus the battery charging system) out of the circuit      and feeding 12 volts directly into the alternator's field      windings, you can get that tiny dynamo to eat enough      Wheaties (in the form of current) to put out about 85 volts      at a reasonable engine speed (roughly 2,800 RPM).    </p>    <p>      But we wanted 110 volts, and with the standard 40-amp      alternator, this would have required revving the engine      higher than we cared to, so we found ourselves a 2-1/4"      General Motors double-grooved alternator pulley that      increased the standard 2.45-to-1      crankshaft-to-alternator-shaft ratio to a steeper 3-to-1      gear-up... which ultimately allows the DC dynamo to produce      110 volts for extended periods without damaging the truck's      six-cylinder engine.    </p>    <p>      Using this setup, it's <em>theoretically</em> possible to      get over 4,000 watts' worth of power from the machinery      already under the vehicle's hood. But to be on the safe      side, we've been limiting our demand to 2,200 watts, or      about 20 amps... still a heck of a lot more current than      even the heftiest power tools would draw.    </p>    <p>      By referring to our pictorial schematic, you'll be able to      get a pretty good idea of how our system's wired and      plumbed. But let's walk through it just once to eliminate      any confusion.    </p>    <p>      We can ignore the charging circuit, because that remains      essentially unchanged. But once the 4-pole, double-throw      master switch is thrown into the "on" position, the remote      power system is activated, and the alternator's      <em>output</em> goes through a pair of 16-gauge wires      (almost a 12-gauge equivalent) to a set of 12-volt, 10-amp      fuses and on through a pair of "extra insurance" automotive      diodes mounted in an aluminum bracket. After running      through an inexpensive ammeter, the current travels into a      1,000-watt resistor (simply a non-immersion heating element      from a mobile home water heater fastened inside a 15"      length of 2" CPVC pipe) and into a weatherproof receptacle,      the opposite legs of which are grounded to the truck.    </p>    <p>      Additionally, a DC voltmeter is grounded through one of the      ammeter terminals... but requires a 150k-ohm resistor to      multiply its existing 0- to 15-volt scale by a factor      often. Also, a solenoid vacuum switch (normally open) taken      from an eight-cylinder Jeep is wired in parallel with the      1,000-watt resistor coils.    </p>    <p>      The plumbing's been added to provide vacuum to a choke      pulldown diaphragm snitched from a Motorcraft two-barrel      carburetor. In conjunction with the Jeep's solenoid-      operated vacuum switch and an aquarium air-supply valve,      this sweet feature allows remote-control operation that's      adjustable to suit a particular job. Put another way, the      vehicle's engine will remain at normal idle speed until      there's a demand on the system of 100 watts or so (prompted      at the moment a tool or appliance is switched on). Then, as      current passes through the resistor, the parallel-wired      solenoid "borrows" enough to kick the open valve closed...      activating the pulldown diaphragm and speeding up the      engine by means of a beaded chain fastened to the throttle      lever with a miniature collar clamp.    </p>    <p>      (The one drawback of this inexpensive remote-control setup      is that as current demand increases, the resistor element      gets warmer... diverting excess voltage to the solenoid,      which could cause it to fail over an extended period. To      circumvent this possibility, we've included in our design      an optional switch that cuts both the resistor and the      solenoid-operated vacuum switch out of the circuit so that      heavy-duty tools or appliances can be used as long as the      alternator maintains its output. An air control valve      placed in the solenoid vacuum line allows engine speed to      be controlled manually.)    </p>    <p>      The adjusting screw on the rear of the choke pulldown      device provides an upper limit which can be used to preset      maximum RPM and, thus, voltage. Similarly, the aquarium      valve can be used to fine-tune output below that limit by      decreasing the vacuum pull on the suction-sensitive      diaphragm. Also, to prevent the diaphragm from yanking the      throttle open too quickly and causing hesitation, the      exposed inlet of the aquarium valve should be soldered      shut, then redrilled with a No. 68 (.031") bit, to allow a      small amount of buffering air bleed.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, when the remote power system is switched off, it      doesn't interfere with the charging circuit or the      foot-operated throttle. And when the aquarium valve is      closed completely, the calculated vacuum leak is eliminated      for normal driving.    </p>    <p>      STAFF PHOTOS    </p>                    <h3>      SOME HELPFUL TIPS    </h3>    <p>      We're not suggesting that everyone should have an emergency      generating station under the hood. But if you feel      comfortable working with automobiles, you might want to      give this setup a try. Remember that we were experimenting      with a 40-amp alternator... and that a higher-output unit      (from an air-conditioned car or a commercial pickup) can      provide high voltage at a lower RPM, in which case you      might not need to find (or machine) an extra-small pulley      for it. Keep in mind, too, that the combination of high      voltage and amperage produced by this modification is every      bit as lethal as the AC socket in your house wall... so      treat it with the same respect! (You can avoid any      <em>low-voltage</em> equipment damage, as well, by      disconnecting the positive terminal of your battery cable      while making the wiring modifications.)    </p>    <p>      Should you plan to run your vehicle over an extended period      of time as an emergency power source for the household      (which is an admittedly fuel-consumptive practice,      considering that the alternator only requires about 6      horsepower of the 100 or more provided by the engine), be      aware that the car's radiator may require a greater rate of      airflow... which can be provided by replacing the      four-bladed fan with a multibladed type.    </p>    <p>      If you use the setup as it was intended to be      used-and that's as an occasional source of temporary      power when none other is available-you'll be sure to      appreciate what a little bit of tinkering, can offer!    </p>
