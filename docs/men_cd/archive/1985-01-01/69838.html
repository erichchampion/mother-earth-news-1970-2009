                    <p>      <em>These fascinationg new discoveries about nursing should      interest even the most experienced mother.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by George Wootan, M.D.    </h5>    <p>      According to a recent study, only 57.6% of new American      mothers breast-feed their babies. But instead of repeating      the common arguments for nursing-in an attempt to      convert the other 42.4%-I'd like to share, with      <em>all</em> parents, some of the recent scientific      findings concerning breast-feeding and how the mother-child      relationship can develop during this special time.    </p>    <h3>      BUT FIRST...    </h3>    <p>      Before the breasts of a new mother produce milk, they      release a thick, yellow substance called colostrum, which      has immune properties and which is actually higher in      protein, minerals, vitamin A, and nitrogen than milk is.      Colostrum coats the baby's stomach and intestines to help      ward off harmful diseases, such as polio and pneumonia, and      helps the baby pass meconium-a tarry substance that      accumulates in the intestines. Also, cells in colostrum      called macrophages destroy potentially dangerous bacteria.    </p>    <h3>      THE MAIN COURSE    </h3>    <p>      When breast milk begins to flow (approximately two to three      days after delivery), it, too, provides important vitamins      and minerals for your baby, including the      brain-cell-builder taurine. While taurine is not an      essential amino acid, its high concentration in breast milk      does seem to indicate a need that cannot be met by the      child's own body. But how much taurine is in formula or      cow's milk? None! (Have <em>you</em> ever seen a smart      cow?) Yet, extremely high levels of this "smart" substance      are found in the brains of children, indicating that it is      an important aid to brain growth. Perhaps <em>not</em>      coincidentally, 96% of brain growth occurs by the age of      five years, and the average age at which a child is weaned      in most cultures that practice infant-led weaning      is-you guessed it-five years.    </p>    <p>      Two commonly told stories about breast milk are that it has      very little iron and that it lacks vitamin D. But the fact      is that breast milk <em>does</em> contain sufficient      amounts of both nutrients, providing the mother has them to      give (she should follow a balanced diet and boost her daily      caloric intake to about 3,500). True, cow's milk and      formula might contain more iron, but it is in a form that      is poorly absorbed by infants. So babies fed these      substitutes get anemic around six months of age if they      don't receive supplemental iron. This is not true of      breast-fed infants. For example, a group of babies in Japan      were <em>totally</em> breast-fed for two years without any      difficulties.    </p>    <p>      In the case of vitamin D, researchers spent a lot of time      and money fruitlessly looking for that essential nutrient      in the fatty portion of breast milk. But where was it? In      the watery part they normally threw down the sink! Now      scientists realize that there is no reason to give a      nursing child vitamin D supplements... even if Mom is an      Eskimo and doesn't see the sun for six months!    </p>    <h3>      DISEASE PREVENTION    </h3>    <p>      Disease resistance is another benefit of breast milk, which      contains 37 known immune mechanisms. These are present the      entire time a mother breast-feeds her child, and can be      divided into the following categories: protective bacteria,      enzyme "attackers," protein binders, antiviral agents, and      antibody "defenders." It is the job of these "fierce"      mechanism groups to find and destroy any viruses or      bacteria that may harm the baby... while also making sure      the youngster gets enough protein and nutrients. However,      as soon as the baby is exposed to solid foods-or even      a bottle of sugar water-17 of these immune mechanisms      are destroyed (by the <em>E. coli</em> bacteria that are      introduced) and can never be restored.    </p>    <p>      Overall, studies have shown that bottle-fed babies are sick      more often than breast-fed babies. This is evident in the      following chart:    </p>		    <p>      A study done in India (where breast-feeding is more the      norm than the exception) indicated that out of 3,684 babies      observed, 7 out of the 2,031 breast-fed children got      pneumonia, whereas 48 out of the 1,653 who were bottle-fed      got the disease.    </p>    <p>      If you become sick with a "bug" while nursing, don't fret      about spreading the sickness to your child. Amazingly      enough, white blood cells appear in the breast milk on the      fourth day after the mother is exposed to the      illness-cells her body has created specifically to      <em>eat</em> that bacterium or virus. Thus your milk will      give your child a specific antidote for the illness you are      worried about. (This sickness-healing sequence obviously      works better if the mother gets sick <em>first</em> .      Fortunately, most times, mothers are "considerate enough"      to do so.)    </p>    <h3>      DRUG USAGE WHILE NURSING    </h3>    <p>      In general, it is best to avoid drugs (including the social      ones) while nursing. Even aspirin must be taken with      caution, since approximately one-twelfth of an adult dosage      is equivalent to a <em>full</em> dosage for a ten-pound      baby. To find out if a particular medicine is safe, please      consult your local La Leche League leader, who should have      a copy of the book <em>Breastfeeding and Drugs in Human      Milk</em> , by Gregory and Mary White. The Whites' book has      the most complete listing available of which drugs are      secreted into breast milk, and in what quantities. This is      a much more accurate, up-to-date, and reliable source than      the <em>Physicians' Desk Reference</em> (PDR), the text      most pediatricians use. (Remember that drugs secreted      through the placenta are not necessarily secreted through      the breast, since the placenta and the breast are different      kinds of transfer organs.)    </p>    <h3>      ADVANTAGES FOR MOM    </h3>    <p>      Breast-feeding benefits the mother by stimulating the      release of the hormone prolactin, which has been found to      induce maternal behavior in laboratory animals. Another      "nursing" hormone, oxytocin, helps to squeeze the milk into      the ducts that lead to the nipple; it also works to relax      the mother. Then too, the baby's sucking helps the mother's      uterus contract to normal size, lowering the amount of      blood loss.<br />      Of course, the increased opportunity for parent-child      bonding offered by breastfeeding is a widely known benefit      of nursing, which brings up an interesting sidelight. A      baby can have lots of brain cells, but they won't do any      good unless they're interconnected. The nerve fibers that      connect these cells are called dendrites. And what develops      dendrites? You probably said breast milk... right? Wrong!      <em>Touching</em> develops dendrites. Holding, touching,      and stroking a baby, as a mother naturally does while      nursing (you can prop a bottle but not a breast!), helps      the child develop the way nature intended.    </p>    <h3>      WHEN TO START FOODS    </h3>    <p>      If this thin, watery stuff called milk is so good, when do      you need to start feeding your baby "real" food? This is a      difficult question to answer. Recent studies have shown      that hydrochloric acid-used to digest most      protein-doesn't even appear in the stomach until the      end of the seventh month and doesn't reach a peak until the      eighteenth month. Co-incidentally, 18 months is      approximately when rennin-used to digest the protein      in breast milk-has disappeared. Also, it seems that      the digestive juice for      carbohydrates-ptyalin-doesn't appear until the      end of the baby's first year. (The old books on baby care      always recommended that mothers pre-chew any solid food.)    </p>    <p>      You may say that <em>your</em> baby was so hungry that he      or she was fighting for solid food at five months, but      actually this probably isn't what was happening. The fact      of the matter is that in your house you have this strange      custom. Each day without fail you gather the clan around a      square board and all of you stuff strange-looking things in      your faces. The baby probably just wanted to be part of the      clan ritual. Remember-babies tend to mimic the      behavior of those around them.    </p>    <p>      With this, I leave to you the decision of when to start      foods, but let me offer two pieces of advice. First, don't      <em>force</em> food on your baby. He or she will let you      know when breast milk isn't completely satisfactory by      showing an increased interest in nursing sessions (which      you will soon discover is <em>not</em> due to a growth      spurt). Second, instead of feeding your child, just let the      youngster feed him-or herself, from food you place on the      high chair tray. (As the father of eleven children, I know      this can be <em>quite</em> a messy experience!)<br />      <br />      This way, not only will your child be less likely to      overeat, but the little one will also tend not to eat foods      he or she may be allergic to. By the way, heavily sweetened      foods, honey, spicy or salty foods, and nuts are definitely      <em>not recommended</em> for babies.    </p>    <h3>      WHEN TO WEAN    </h3>    <p>      As soon as the baby is introduced to anything other than      breast milk, the weaning process has begun. It is best to      do this slowly, and, as with solid foods, let the baby tell      you when he or she is ready to "leave home."      (Remember-release, not reject.) Contrary to popular      belief, a child who is weaned at a late age is not any more      dependent than a child weaned earlier. In fact, the late      nurser may be more <em>independent</em> because the choice      to break away from Mom was his or her own. So, don't let      yourself be influenced by the behavior or reaction of other      mothers-this should be a decision between you and      your child.    </p>    <p>      Breast milk is species-specific. It has everything in it      that the baby needs, in the right amounts. It fulfills both      physical and emotional needs. It is not habit-forming, and      all children wean themselves when they have had enough.    </p>    <p>      Try it. You, and yours, will like it.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Dr. Wootan offers a fine seminar for      parents on basic pediatrics.

Minor St., Emmaus, PA 18049).</em>    </p>    <h3>      Put Nursing Fears to Rest    </h3>    <p>      <em>Does the thought of nursing give you butterflies? If      so, here are some helpful hints.<br />      The first two or three weeks of breastfeeding can be very      difficult for a new mother, but take a deep breath... and      relax! It is very important to get plenty of R and R during      the nursing period, as this will stimulate the let-down      reflex-the squeezing of milk from the alveoli. Fear,      anxiety, confusion, or fatigue can hamper this reaction, so      find a comfortable, tension-free spot to nurse.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Two common misbeliefs are that small-breasted women      cannot produce enough milk and that if you do not have      enough milk when you begin nursing, you will never satisfy      your baby's great need for nourishment. Not true! In all      pregnant women a physical change occurs in the milk ducts      that enlarges the breasts. Likewise, the more your baby      nurses, the more milk your breasts produce. And a new baby      nurses approximately every 1-1/2 hours at first.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Initially, try 7-10 minutes on each side to help      prevent nipple soreness... then gradually increase this      time. (Nipple-toughening exercises during pregnancy, such      as frequent exposure to air, are highly recommended.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It may take almost a week for you and your baby to      nurse successfully-but don't give up! Going to a      series of La Leche League meetings while you're pregnant      will help establish a support system, in case you have      problems later. In the event of any middle-of-the-night      crises, ring up La Leche League International at      312/455-7730. An expert is always on hand to offer advice      and support.
