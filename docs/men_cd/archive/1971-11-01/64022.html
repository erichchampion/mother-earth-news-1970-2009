                    <h5 id="byline">      by alice okorn    </h5>        <p>      Before you use your entire harvest of grapes, apples and      pears for wine, jelly or just plain eating . . . try      mashing some for vinegar. With very little time, effort and      expense you can have your own delicious, homemade variety      on salads every day of the year.    </p>    <p>      Vinegar seems to be one of those rare foolproof products      that anyone can make at home, <em>if</em> the original      ingredients are tart enough. We once tried to make our      supply of the condiment from apples that apparently were      too mild and, even though we let the bottled brew stand for      over two years, it never did have any "bite". Mild apples,      we found, will produce only a weak flavor that's difficult      to recognize as vinegar ... so be sure the fruit you use is      good and tart.    </p>    <p>      The least expensive apples to use for vinegar are those      that are bruised or that have dropped from the tree. No      matter if they have big, brown spots . . . that's the start      of the fermentation you want.    </p>    <p>      The next cheapest method of obtaining vinegar apples or      pears is by going to an orchard right at the end of harvest      and ' picking the hard-to-get-at leftovers. Last year we      obtained lovely apples this way for only a dollar a bushel.    </p>    <p>      By the way, although tart apples and pears - or a      combination of the two - will certainly make good      vinegar, you needn't be restricted to such traditional      "cider vinegar" fruits. Our favorite version of the sour      liquid seasoning is made from a base of Concord grapes.      It's different from and much more flavorful than either      store-bought cider or wine vinegar.    </p>    <p>      Once you have your apples, pears or whatever, pick the      fruit over (to make sure it's clean) and chop it up      somehow. Grapes are simple - just mash them -      but pears and apples present more difficulty. Sure, you can      grind them . . . but if you're working with several      bushels, that takes a lot of time and energy. My husband,      Richard, simply puts the tree fruit in a sturdy wooden      container and smashes it with a two-by-four.    </p>    <p>      Allow the mashed fruit to ferment in a clean crockery,      glass or wooden container . . . NEVER metal. Be sure to      leave a lot of headroom (25% or so) for expansion and keep      an eye on the pulp as it ferments.    </p>    <p>      The container should be covered during this fermentation      with a towel or piece of old sheet - tied on tightly      with string - to let in the air needed by the process      while keeping the gnats and flies out.    </p>    <p>      Set the brew in a room - like a basement - with      a moderate temperature and let it age for four to six      months. Stir and taste the "workings" occasionally and      - when the flavor pleases you - strain out the      juice and store it in a cool, dark place in glass jugs. If      you leave the lids somewhat loose, it'll keep for years.    </p>    <p>      If the finished product is too weak, strengthen it with      some "boughten" as you use it. If the vinegar is too      strong, thin it with water as you make salads or whatever.    </p>    <p>      We use our homemade brew for ALL our salads . . . and we      eat a lot of them! One simple dressing that really shows      off the flavor of this made-at-home product is a mixture of      equal parts vinegar, oil and honey. For dress-up, we add      herbs.    </p>    <p>      I don't can with my vinegar, though, for fear its acidity      may not be right (store vinegar has a controlled acid      content that always assures uniform results) . . . I'd hate      to ruin a batch of pickles or something.    </p>    <p>      Still and all, homemade vinegar is so delicious and simple      to make that we have it on hand at all times here at      Fertile Hills Farm. Once you've tried it, chances are you      will too . . . it may very well be the simplest and easiest      good eating that you can bottle for your shelf of      made-on-the-farm foodstuffs.    </p>
