                    <h2 id="subtitle">      miracle food for a nickel a pound    </h2>    <p>      One of the basic tenets of the (Heaven forbid!) Protestant      Ethic is <em>you don't get something for nothing . . .</em>      and the way we've allowed the system to become organized,      that's certainly true. In fact, you could say <em>more</em>      than true.    </p>    <p>      Consider the rather small pile of devitalized and      fortified, homogenized and separated, treated, processed,      preserved, bleached and embalmed plastic food the local      supermarket just traded you for that rather large stack of      hard-earned bills. Clearly a case, say the malcontents      among us, of <em>getting nothing for something . . .</em>      and they may be right.    </p>    <p>      Well, there <em>is</em> a way out of this dilemma because      you can grow your own completely natural, unprocessed and      unpoisoned food at home . . . on pennies a day . . . fresh      all year round. Yep. And unbelievable as it may sound, you      can do it without a degree in agriculture, complicated      machinery, fourteen kinds of fertilizer or a single,      solitary cubic inch of soil.    </p>    <p>      What's more, you can raise this "garden" anytime and      anywhere . . . in your own kitchen, crossing the country in      a camper or sitting on a flagpole. And finally, the      "vegetables" you produce will be many times tastier, much      more nutritious and far less expensive than      <em>anything</em> you can buy. If that's not something for      nothing, it's an awful lot for mighty little.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, since such a food is almost too good to be true,      our Western heritage-famed for DDT, thermonuclear bombs and      the pop-top beer can-has neglected to advise us about      it. (Maybe because it's so hard to exploit commercially?)      Yet almost every primitive tribe and the entire Eastern      world-back to the dawn of recorded history-has      made good use of . . . sprouted seeds, or sprouts.    </p>    <h3>SPROUTS: MIRACLE FOOD</h3>    <p>      Sprouts are truly a miracle food. You can grow them almost      any time and any place on only water, air      and-sometimes-a little sunlight. You can      produce a new crop every two to six days with a total of,      maybe, 10 minutes work. They're more nourishing than milk,      fresh meat . . . or anything: you could live almost      indefinitely on nothing but sprouts if you wanted. They      store exceptionally well in a refrigerator and can even be      dried. You can eat them thousands of ways . . . on      breakfast cereal, in fresh salads, steamed, in scrambled      eggs, sprinkled on soups, in meat loaf, as a major      ingredient of the world's absolutely best tasting and most      nutritious bread, fried, in stews, blended into health      drinks, as a sandwich filling, in desserts, as a snack. And      even at today's inflated prices, sprouts will cost you only      moat <em>about five  cents a pound.</em>    </p>    <p>      Sprouts, in short, are so fantastically great that if      General Mills or the President's Commission On Poverty had      developed them-they would most certainly be      ballyhooed as The Complete, Transcending Nutritional      Miracle Of All Time. Neither God nor Mother Nature ever      hired a press agent, however, so most residents of the      United States eat sprouts only occasionally and only by      accident when they happen to dine in a chinese      restaurant.<br />    </p>    <h3>WE ARE WHAT WE EAT</h3>    <p>      And more's the pity. Because a mere twenty or twenty-five      million dollars (pin money in the current federal budget)      well invested <em>one time</em> in sprouting containers and      instructions distributed to the residents of tenant-farm      shacks and crumbling tenements across this fair land . . .      could conceivably wipe out malnutrition in the U.S....      completely.    </p>    <p>      That's a sweeping statement, but look at it this way: we      think we're pretty smart here in the U.S. of A. because      "with the world's most technically advanced agribusiness",      we successfully raise enough food (even though we don't      distribute it) to feed our 200 million people <em>and</em>      have some left over to export. Of course we're rapidly      poisoning all our potable water with nitrates and      pesticides, we're "farming out" the top soil in the midwest      and we're silting and salting away hundreds of thousands of      acres in the irrigated southwest . . . but, as they say,      "that's the price we have to pay".    </p>    <p>      Now consider creaky old, backward, underdeveloped China.      With less really fertile farm land, almost no chemical      fertilizers and hardly any modern farm machinery, China      also exports grain . . . and feeds nearly <em>one      billion</em> citizens. One billion! A thousand million.      Have you any idea what a tremendous accomplishment that is      . . . and how impossible it would be for our "modern"      agricultural system? Pretty clever, these Chinese. How do      they do it?    </p>    <p>      Well one of China's secrets is sprouts. Matter of fact, the      earliest recorded mention of the tremendous food value of      germinated seeds occurs in a book attributed to the Emperor      of China about 2939 B.C. . . . and it probably wasn't a new      idea even then. Now, five thousand years later, Chinese      cuisine-among the most delicious and nutritious in      the world-still puts special emphasis on sprouts. If      that doesn't make the little beasties "time tested",      nothing will!    </p>    <p>      Now, if you will, reflect a moment on the fantastic dif      ference in life style that the lowly sprout can wield.      Sprouts are home-grown by nearly every Chinese family, thus      assuring each living unit of a steady supply of      high-energy, low-cost food and automatically eliminating      much of the wasteful transportation, processing, packaging      and retailing costs of our "more highly developed" food      production system. The Chinese thus wisely avoid the      equivalent of giant trucks belching diesel fumes as they      haul frozen lettuce from California to Chicago, vast      networks of concrete creeping in upon the last open spaces      and sprawling supermarkets selling plastic produce, which      is to say that we are what we eat in far more ways than      one.    </p>    <p>      To make a long story medium-length, then, the Chinese have      been relying heavily on sprouts ever since that ancient      Emperor wrote his book on plants and foods . . . and so      have a lot of other folks in the Eastern world and a number      of underdeveloped nations. And well they might, because      modern research is continually proving and reproving the      nutritional qualities of sprouts.    </p>    <h3>      SPROUTING CONTAINERS AND HOW TO USE THEM</h3>        <p>      You can successfully grow sprouts in any number of common      kitchen containers if you adapt your technique to the      equipment at hand. Just keep in mind that the ideal sprout      "garden" provides a warm, dark, moist- <em>not      wet</em> -environment for the developing seeds. It's      also a good idea to use one jar, strainer, pan or whatever      exclusively for raising shoots (to help prevent tainting      them).    </p>    <p>      Probably the simplest container of all is a largemouthed      quart jar (use a smaller or bigger jar, depending on how      many sprouts you want to grow at a time). Most folks who      use such a jar simply dump in the seeds, stretch a piece of      cheesecloth over the top and secure the cloth with a rubber      band. Others prefer to cut a circle of wire mesh which is      clamped to the jar top by a screw-on canning ring. Either      cover allows convenient and thorough flushing of the shoots      every four to six hours as they develop. Such a sprouting      container is usually kept in a dark cupboard between      rinsings. A large bowl makes an ideal holder for the jar      during these growth periods since the container should be      held top down at about a 45Â° angle to insure proper      drainage of the sprouts.    </p>    <p>      An earthenware flowerpot with its bottom drain hole      partially blocked by cheesecloth or a wad of cotton also      makes a good sprout garden. Unglazed pottery is best      because it absorbs water and thus insures that the shoots      will be kept moist but not wet. Cover the pot with a saucer      and set it in a shallow pan of water. Remember, however,      that even though moisture will "wick" through the bottom of      an unglazed flowerpot, the sprouts will still need regular      rinsings of clean water to retard the development of mold.    </p>    <p>      Tea strainers, collanders and coffee percolators are      excellent sprouting containers and-several years ago,      while living in Seattle-I modified two plastic      freezing cartons, a small square of screen wire and a piece      of sponge into a "never fail" version of the tea strainer      sprouter (see illustration). The large cans and metal      mesh-covered trays used by commercial sprouters are another      variation on the same idea.    </p>    <p>      In a pinch, seeds can be sprouted between moist towels,      sponges or layers of paper although lack of ventilation      usually leads to souring and molds when using paper and the      shoots have an annoying habit of growing through the      towels.    </p>    <p>      Small sprouters are also sold by a few mail order companies      but are usually overpriced and work no better than the      quart jar described here. As a matter of fact, few      expensive store-bought sprouters work as well as the      freezer carton-screen wiresponge combination illustrated      with this piece.-JS.    </p>    <h3>MODERN SCIENCE DISCOVERS      SPROUTS</h3>    <p>      Dr. Pauline Berry Mack, at the University of Pennsylvania,      has tested sprouted soybeans for Vitamin C (the      ungerminated seed contains none) and found that-when      sprouted 72 hours-one-half cup of the shoots      contained as much Vitamin C as six <em>glasses of orange      juice.</em>    </p>    <p>      Similar incredible leaps in vitamin content have been      recorded for other sprouts. Yale's Dr. Paul Burkholder      <strong>,</strong> for instance, discovered that oats      sprouted five days had 500% more B 6 , 600% more folic      acid, 10% more B 1 and 1350% more B 2 than unsprouted oats.    </p>    <p>      It should be noted, of course, that such vitamin increases      are not always a straight-line thing. Vitamin B 1 -to      cite one example-runs up and down like a yoyo in      soybeans as they sprout . . . but the general trend is      always spectacularly up and sprouted seeds are an excellent      source of vitamins A, B-complex, C, D, E, G, K-even      U-and minerals such as calcium, magnesium,      phosphorous, chlorine, potassium, sodium and silicon. All      in natural forms which the body can readily assimilate.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, according to Dr. Francis Pottenger, Jr.,      sprouted grains and legumes supply all eight essential      amino acids which make up "complete" protein. Other      investigations have shown that many of the proteins in      sprouts are already "predigested", or broken down into      their constituent amino acids.    </p>    <p>      Sprouts also just happen to be packed full of      enzymes-the complex catalysts which initiate and      control almost every chemical reaction that takes place in      living organisms-too. Since the body gradually      manufactures fewer and fewer enzymes as it ages, since      enzymes are killed by temperatures greater than 140Â°      (cooking) and since our stock of enzymes must be      replenished by eating fresh produce . . . it seems that      we've just discovered another dang good reason for      consuming goodly quantities of raw, freshly-grown sprouts.    </p>    <p>      Then too, it's interesting to note that Dr. Loa of Yenching      University in Peking reports that the high level of simple      sugars in sprouts puts the little shoots in the category of      "quick energy" foods, since the monosaccarides they contain      require little digestive breakdown and enter the      bloodstream almost immediately.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps most amazing of all-particularly in      comparison with the chemically preserved but nutritionally      next-to-worthless foods from the supermarket-all the      body builders which appear as sprouts grow . . . turn out      to be almost <em>perfectly stable.</em> Even after      dehydration or freezing, sprouts retain their enhanced      nutritive values.    </p>    <h3>HOW DO THOSE LITTLE BITTY SEEDS DO      IT?</h3>    <p>      But where do all these great things come from? How can      seeds full of fat and starches . . . plus plain old air,      water and a little sunshine . . . add up to vitamins,      proteins and enzymes?    </p>    <p>      Simple. During sprouting, those fats and starches are      converted into vitamins, simple sugars and proteins as they      absorb the air and water.    </p>    <p>      Seeds, you see, are divided into two basic parts: a      miniature replica of a plant (the embryo) and a supply of      stored carbohydrates, oils and proteins (the endosperm).      When environmental conditions are suitable-here's      where the warmth, moisture and air comes in-a seed      germinates. That is, the tiny embryo feeds upon the      endosperm until it has roots sunk into the soil and leaves      opened to the sun.    </p>    <p>      During this process, much of the until-now-inactive      endosperm is converted into readily-available nutrients . .      . and that metamorphosis is the key to the miracle food      value of sprouts. If we harvest the little shoots      <em>after</em> the endosperm has been transformed into rich      vitamins, enzymes, amino acids, etc. but <em>before</em>      the embryo gets a chance to consume the nourishment . . .      we've got about the best-for-us food imaginable!    </p>    <p>      Well, the theory is beautiful . . . but what about      practical results? "I'm glad," said he, in his best W.C.      Field's voice, "you asked that question." Here are just a      handful of astonishing health cures credited to sprouts:    </p>    <p>      During WWI, Dr. Cyrus French used sprouted peas and lentils      rich in Vitamin C to rid British and Indian troops in      Mesopotamia of scurvy symptoms.    </p>    <p>      In the Philippines, a Dr. Santos cured patients of      beri-beri by administering sprouted mung beans as the only      source of B-complex vitamins.    </p>    <p>      Ann Wigmore of Boston has demonstrated the beneficial      effects of sprouts in retarding and curing problems ranging      from diabetes to ulcers to cancer.    </p>    <p>      Fertility was restored to barren cows at the Agricultural      Experimental Station in Beltsville, Maryland by feeding the      animals Vitamin E-laden oat sprouts.    </p>    <p>      Major Wiltshire of King's College in England, finding that      Algerian laborers in France suffered from scurvy (although      they'd been healthy at home), traced their diet deficiency      to commercial beer . . . which lacks the Vitamin C of their      native sprouted millet beer.    </p>    <p>      If you need more convincing, Catharyn Elwood packs a lot of      examples into a few pages of her book, FEEL LIKE A MILLION      (Pocket Books, Inc., 75 cents). For now, let's just say      that sprouts are <em>powerful</em> food.    </p>    <p>      Inexpensive too. If you buy a hundred pounds of      organically-grown soybeans for fifteen dollars plus      freight, say, your cost per pound will average twenty       cents. If you then soak and sprout the beans, you'll find      you harvest four to eight pounds of shoots from each pound      of dry beans. Your cost for the delicious, vitamin-packed      sprouts, then, is <em>less than five  cents per pound</em> .      . . nothing to sneeze at in these days of funny money,      recession and unemployment.    </p>    <h3>BUT DO SPROUTS TASTE      GOOD?</h3>    <p>      I can appreciate questions about the taste of sprouts      because I don't care for cooked okra, turnips, cabbage and      a lot of other garden fare. I <em>do</em> like fresh green      salads and raw vegetables, however, and that's what most      sprouts-especially raw alfalfa sprouts-are all      about. Soybean shoots served the same way have a little too      much raw bean taste for me but become magically delicious      with only the slightest (about one-two minutes) steaming.      Sprouted wheat goes well on cereal and is excellent in      home-baked bread, rye sprouts add a mouthwatering wild rice      taste when sprinkled into soups just before serving and      sprouted peas are fantastic if lightly steamed and served      with a pat of butter melting down through them. Almost      everyone, of course, has a favorite Chinese recipe built      around mung bean sprouts.    </p>    <p>      Which is to say that there's almost as much variety in the      taste of sprouts as there is in "traditional" vegetables.      Personal tastes vary but you're sure to find at least half      a dozen "kinds" of sprouts and a couple of hundred sprout      recipes that suit you to a T. Almost any natural foods      cookbook features a great number of ideas for using the      little critters, starting with raw salads and ending with      "pick-me-up" beverages made by blending the shoots with      various combinations of fruit juices, nuts and honey. The      possibilities are truly endless.    </p>    <p>      So, if you recognize a good thing when you see it, you're      probably gonna run right out, get you a sprouter and start      tapping all the goodness Momma Nature has locked into      seeds. To coin a phrase, "Start sprouting . . . and start      living!"    </p>    <h3>      HOW AND WHAT TO SPROUT</h3>        <p>      Almost any seed, grain or legume can be successfully      sprouted although most devotees of the art think that      alfalfa, soybeans, mung beans, lentils, peas and the cereal      grasses-wheat, oats, barley and rye-give the      very best results. Unhulled sesame and sunflower, radish,      mustard, red clover, fenugreek, corn, lima beans, pinto      beans, kidney beans, chick peas, cress, millet and nearly      any other seed you can think of will work, however (never      eat potato sprouts though, the plant is a member of the      poisonous nightshade family).    </p>    <p>      Select clean, whole seeds . . . the best you can find. Make      certain they haven't been chemically treated in any way,      however, because the poison could have damaged the embryo      which might cause the seed to rot instead of sprout.      Needless to say, the treatment might also sicken or poison      you.    </p>    <p>      Wash the seeds thoroughly, pick out any chaff or cracked      hulls and check the grain or whatever for fertility      (sterile seeds float).    </p>    <p>      It only takes about a tablespoon of alfalfa seeds and two      or three times that amount of beans or peas to "plant"      25-30 square inches. Soak the seeds overnight in a warm,      dark place (such as a kitchen cupboard) in about three      times as much water as you have seeds. The water should be      warm (70-80Â°) and free of chlorine and flourine (which      can sterilize the tender embryo). Some of the smaller      seeds-alfalfa, clover, etc.-will sprout without      this overnight soak but it won't hurt them.    </p>    <p>      Pour the water off the next morning and save it to add to      fruit juices or use as stock (it's loaded with      water-soluble vitamins and minerals). The seeds will have      doubled in size and should be rinsed carefully to avoid      mold.    </p>    <p>      Place the seeds in a warm, moist, dark container. Flush      every four to six hours with water to clean the developing      sprouts and to insure adequate moisture for their growth.      Be absolutely certain the seeds drain well after each      rinsing, however, for they'll sour and rot if left standing      in water. Remember too that some heat will be generated by      the sprouts. They'll need a little ventilation so don't      cover them too tightly.    </p>    <p>      In three to six days, depending on temperature (80-90Â°      is best for most) and seed variety, your sprouts will again      have doubled or tripled in volume and you'll have yourself      some mighty good and nourishing eating. The greater number      of shoots are at peak vitamin potency 60 to 80 hours after      germinating . . . but personal preferences in taste,      texture and appearance may persuade you to let yours grow      longer.    </p>    <p>      Soybeans, peas and alfalfa are about right when their      sprouts are two to three inches long. Grain shoots should      be eaten when much shorter-about the length of the      kernel itself-or they're bitter. Sunflower sprouts      also develop a rather unpleasant tangy taste when they      exceed the length the seeds from which they develop. The      lentil sprout is best when about an inch long, while shoots      from the mild-flavored mung bean may be allowed to reach a      length of three or four inches before harvest. By the way,      some people pluck the seed hull from each sprout before      serving but that's a waste of time and good nutrition . . .      eat the whole shebang!    </p>    <p>      If you expose your sprouts to indirect sunlight during      their final several hours of growth, they'll develop      chlorophyl. Too much of this green substance causes the      shoots to toughen, however, so don't overdo it. Some      chlorophyl is good, though, because its molecule is very      similar to hemoglobin-the only difference being that      chlorophyl has magnesium at its center while hemoglobin has      iron-and, consequently, acts as a kind of blood      booster.    </p>        <p>      You may have some difficulty getting soybeans to sprout      successfully, especially in warm weather, so be      particularly careful to use beans from the current year's      crop (this is good advice generally). Varieties which      sprout best include Chief, Ebony, Illini, Lincoln and      Richland . . . and, happily, all beans lose their      gas-producing qualities as they turn into shoots.    </p>
