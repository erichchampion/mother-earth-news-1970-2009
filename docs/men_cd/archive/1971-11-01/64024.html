                    <h5 id="byline">      by TILDE MERKERT    </h5>			    <p>      There's an old recipe for rabbit stew that begins, "First      kill the rabbit." Well, like succulent rabbit stew, those      delightful gourmet vinegars that command such fancy prices      at the store have a very simple base and one could begin a      recipe for them with the line, "First pick the apples."    </p>    <p>      You can start with apples - that is - and      easily make your own base vinegar, but it isn't necessary.      Not when you can take any ordinary, pure apple cider      vinegar . . . add your own ac cents . . . and produce exotic      gourmet vinegars with a back-to-nature touch.    </p>    <p>      The process is really quite uncomplicated, although the      concoctions with mixed flavors do require more ingredients      than the simpler one-herb vinegars. I can assure you,      though, that the whole business is great fun and your      creative products will be much less expensive than the      gourmet varieties in the stores.    </p>    <p>      So let your imagination soar and see what you can create.      Here, to get you started, are four proven recipes of my      own:    </p>    <h3>ORANGE-ROSEMARY VINEGAR</h3>    <p>      1 quart pure apple cider vinegar<br />      4 tablespoons (heaping) fresh rosemary leaves (or 2 table      spoons dried rosemary)<br />      1 large, juicy, naturally well-colored orange<br />    </p>    <p>      Peel only the thinnest outside rind from the orange,      avoiding any of the white underneath. Chop fine. Strip four      tablespoons of needles (leaves) from the fresh rosemary and      bruise the leaves in a mortar and pestle, if you have one.      I use a heavy white crockery mortar and pestle that doesn't      retain other tastes and aromas. You can also lay the leaves      on doubled wax paper and crush them with a small, old-time      crockery bowl or coffee cup.    </p>    <p>      Place the rosemary and peel in a quart jar. Add vinegar.      Let stand, tightly covered, for two weeks and shake      frequently to hasten flavor release. Strain through a sieve      to remove solid matter and then strain a second time      through a clean cloth laid in the sieve.    </p>    <p>      Pour into picturesque bottle, add several freshly cut curls      of orange peel and a sprig of rosemary . . . and set out as      the beginning of a collection of your own innovations.    </p>    <p>      The mixture is excellent with fresh fruit or as an      ingredient in a fruit salad dressing made of three parts      oil and one part vinegar. Salt and pepper to taste (a dash      of sugar is optional).    </p>    <p>      When resorting to dried rosemary for this recipe, first      bring the vinegar to a boil. Add rosemary. Cool. Add orange      peel and let stand. Whether you use your own fresh rosemary      or the dried bought-at-thestore variety, be sure it's still      potently flavored and fragrant.    </p>    <h3>SPICE VINEGAR</h3>    <p>      1 quart pure apple cider vinegar<br />      1 tablespoon whole allspice<br />      1 tablespoon whole white peppers<br />      1 tablespoon whole cloves<br />      1 tablespoon whole coriander seed<br />      1/2 teaspoon celery seed<br />      2 tablespoons sugar<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1 small chunk dried ginger root<br />    </p>    <p>      Mix spices and vinegar, holding out ginger root. Simmer      gently for one hour. Cool slightly and pour into a quart      jar. Add ginger root. Cover tightly and let stand two      weeks, shaking frequently. Strain, using sieve and cloth      method. Bottle and use. Wonderfully good for marinating      cooked vegetables. Fine for basting ham and fowl. Tasty on      sliced fresh cucumbers.    </p>    <h3>MINT VINEGAR</h3>    <p>      1 good handful fresh mint leaves (or 3 tablespoons dried      mint leaves)<br />      1 quart pure apple cider vinegar (or 1 quart distilled      white vinegar)    </p>    <p>      Wash the fresh mint, shake it well and bruise it with a      pestle or wooden potato masher. Pack in a glass quart jar.      Pour in vinegar (when using dried mint, bring the vinegar      to a boil before adding the mint). Cover tightly and let      stand a good two weeks. Strain and bottle. You may want to      add a few drops of green vegetable coloring . . . with      cider vinegar, it produces a verdant "artist's" green.    </p>    <p>      This is an excellent vinegar with lamb. It's also good in      fruit salad dressings and - believe it or not -      delicious in iced drinks. You might want to freeze a tray,      with a mint sprig in each cube . . . a real conversation      piece. More surprising yet, this vinegar is great for      bathing the forehead to banish a headache and bring on      sleep.    </p>    <h3>ONION FAMILY VINEGAR</h3>    <p>      1 quart pure apple cider vinegar<br />      4 small onions, or 6 shallots, or 3 cloves of garlic    </p>    <p>      I use such a title because this vinegar can be made from      any member of the onion family . . . the straight forward      onion, the potent garlic, the more subtle shallot and even      chives or garlic chives (either fresh or frozen . . .      chives freeze very well).<br />    </p>    <p>      Peel the onions, garlic or shallots. Then simply immerse      them in the vinegar until the taste suits you. Keep the      mixture tightly covered and when it's ready . . . remove      onions, bottle and use.    </p>    <p>      To prepare chive vinegar, chop the chives fine, add them to      the fluid and let stand for a week or ten days. Strain and      use.    </p>    <p>      Onion family vinegar is remarkably good on tossed green      salads. Use it with anything that needs a garlic accent or      tenderize cheap cuts of beef by soaking them overnight in      the tangy brew.    </p>
