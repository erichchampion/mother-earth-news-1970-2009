                    <h5 id="byline">      By SALLI RASBERRY & ROBERT GREENWAY    </h5>    <p>      Reprinted by permission from RASBERRY/$3.95 plus 50Q      postage/<br />      Freestone Publishing/440 Bohemian High way/Sebastopol,      Calif. 95472.    </p>        <p>      "Getting started" means a few people come together.    </p>    <p>      For those not already in communities of fighters or      farmers, the catalyst may be someone with a sudden      conviction about a particularly bad local public school      scene; or a graduate student reading Maslow or Holt and      becoming inspired; a high school kid in trouble with the      police, or fighting with a principal who has demanded that      his hair be cut; some public school teachers meeting to      share anguish; someone coming out of a particularly      revealing acid trip.    </p>    <p>      Coming together is like a dance, like dogs coming together      to sniff each other's vital private premises. Impressions      are quickly formed-people's dress., what they bring      to eat ("They're still into white sugar!"), whether they      take an offered joint, how open and straight they are with      their children.    </p>    <p>      Goals are raised: some want to protect or convey or expand      an ideology or social cause; some simply want to add to an      existing community; some have a heavy personal need,      perhaps loneliness; some have an idea-a vision about      what a learning environment could be; some simply can go no      further than hating public schools. Some have all these      goals.    </p>    <p>      It's terribly complicated-if you want to look at it      that way. But mostly it's exciting and beautiful: sometimes      a group with goals exploding outwards like their own growth      rates. Every group has its unique mix, its balance, its      "magic mood of harmony" waiting to be discovered. Some make      it, some don't.    </p>    <p>      Here are some beginnings:    </p>    <h3>      <em>SCENE 1</em>    </h3>    <p>      A school forms in a university-urban area having a high      concentration of radicals and Blacks. No one can say      exactly how it started-probably someone at the local      free university office. But 40 parents with 70 children      from 4-14 show up for a meeting called to "explore starting      a school where children can follow their own interests      rather than a decadent establishment's interests."    </p>    <p>      No Black parents show (there is one Chinese family-an      engineer who feels his children are not learning fast      enough in the local school). The rest are about evenly      divided between hip-yippies and hip-looking professionals      and academians.    </p>    <p>      They decide to hold a series of picnic-like discussions to      find out what they want. Thus begins a long series of      forum-like debates with a huge range of views (one of which      is that all such discussions are bull crap). But grass      flows freely, people begin to know and trust each other,      and small groupings, social and work, begin to emerge. The      main division is between those who want "structure" and      those who don't. Those who do are, by and l arge, those      with straight jobs-and money-and they pull out      after about a year of meetings and start their own school      with two teachers, 20 kids (a strict maximum), teachers      paid $400 per month plus a fixed budget for expenses for      the school, total control of day-to-day teaching turned      over to the teachers, all parents agreeing to meet with      teachers twice a month for heavy discussions of everything,      including intimate details of feelings about the children      and each other.    </p>    <p>      Those remaining form a Board which forms a very relaxed      "plan-it-each-day" school, hires six teachers for 50      children, can't pay them, the teachers "strike", parents      struggle to keep it going, and finally they are evicted      from a rented hall for non-payment.    </p>    <h3>      <em>SCENE 2</em>    </h3>    <p>      Several suburban families meet at a PTA meeting and decide      (over drinks, afterwards) to form their own school. Their      first decision is to have an encounter group among      themselves every Friday evening. This uncovers the usual      rocky marriages, sexual attractions, adult needs.    </p>    <p>      The women decide to form a nonprofit corporation and to      raise money through foundations "for the school." For a      proposal they write a description of what they want the      school to be, based on John Holt, A.S. Neill, and Sylvia      Ashton-Warner. It becomes their founding charter, built      into a "corporation" which a lawyer friend helps them draw      up.    </p>    <p>      They announce public meetings after forming a Board      consisting of themselves, and several professional friends.      Their first meeting attracts 20 families with 55 children.      Later at a series of town-meeting-like events (voting,      motions, etc.) they decide on "policy" which the board is      supposed to oversee, on hiring six paid teachers, six      volunteers, and on holding monthly pot-luck meetings to      raise issues and decide new policies. The meeting is      friendly but superficial-the original families retain      power, the "newcomers" defer to them with considerable awe.    </p>    <p>      The board begins looking for teachers, finds only one with      experience for $250 a month, hires two mothers for $150 a      month (plus free tuition for their children) and three      college seniors "with some teaching experience" from the      nearby college. Money needs seem critical, so students      spearhead a rock-concert benefit to raise money, which      loses $400 but a good time is had by all amidst much      publicity.    </p>    <p>      The "teachers" have their first meeting the day before      "opening" and find themselves locked in bitter debate over      time schedules, room space in their rented building,      whether to have classes at all.    </p>    <p>      The children are pretty much free at first and they seem      happy playing. They soon get bored, however, and begin      complaining at home. Parents get very uptight, feel only      bad vibes from visits to the school, call a series of      crisis meetings. The school falls apart by January. The      parents blame the one experienced teacher who wanted to      coordinate things and arrange compromises between diverse      approaches.    </p>    <h3>      <em>SCENE 3</em>    </h3>    <p>      Six Native American families in an urban ghetto decide they      must have their own school. Their children are becoming      Americanized in a particularly revolting way and are      falling behind in all academic subjects as well. They are      desperate and they pull their children out of public school      without fanfare or much discussion.    </p>    <p>      Three of the women start teaching "basics" in one of the      homes. Neighbors complain at the noise (there are 18 kids),      the complaint electrifies the group into combat-kids      and parents work around the clock printing leaflets,      calling on politicians, winning support from radical      political groups. They worry occasionally about "not having      time for the school" but the children seem far happier and      some of the fathers feel they're learning Indian ways just      fine.    </p>    <p>      After three months of this their local public school      district informs the police department of the truancy of      the 18 children and the parents are ordered to show cause      why their children should not be enrolled in the public      school. Some decide to fight it, get an ACLU lawyer, who      puts them in touch with the New Schools Exchange-they      are stunned to find hundreds of schools started by people      not too different from themselves. They decide to get a      charter, incorporate, become a legal school in order to      satisfy compulsory attendance laws. But some parents regard      this as selling out, and threaten to fight any probation      officer's attempts to take <em>their</em> children to the      public school.    </p>    <p>      The once-unified group drifts apart-into these two      camps-fighters and accommodators . . .    </p>    <h3>      <em>SCENE 4</em>    </h3>    <p>      About eight families of country people living near a resort      area decide their children ought to have some schooling.    </p>    <p>      Mostly poets and musicians, they gather one Sunday      afternoon in the summer. About half are on welfare. They      decide start gathering together every morning when      September rolls around, and do what whoever shows up wants      to do. Someone suggests that they drop acid together and      have a heavy learning experience but there's strong      disagreement about this and the idea drifts away. Grass is      passed freely, then gallons of wine.    </p>    <p>      The children wander in and out, seem mildly amused.    </p>    <p>      About the middle of September they begin gathering each      morning anywhere from 9:00 to 11:00 A.M. The children have      a good time playing; the grown-ups sit in the morning sun      drinking tea. Every now and then a parent will read a story      to whichever of the children want to hear. There are      suggestions about art classes every now and then.      Everyone-children and grownups both-seem      nervous at any mention of learning "skills like writing and      spelling."    </p>    <p>      After a time, several of the families wish they had more      craft teaching and decide to search for a teacher. They      find a rather large woman who is a noted craftswoman and      invite her to be "a teacher in the school." She asks for      $200 and five of the eight families say they'll pay $40 per      month each to pay it.    </p>    <p>      After a few weeks they discover with considerable horror      that the woman is a stern disciplinarian, requiring that      children who commit themselves to working with her must      keep a rigorous schedule. About half the children drift      off, including two children from the families who wanted      the teacher in the first place.    </p>    <p>      Several of the parents are angered at having a paid teacher      around, and stop coming. The school goes on almost totally      centered around the craft lady-about half the kids      working with her, and the other kids wandering around and      playing.    </p>        <h3>      <em>SCENE 5</em>    </h3>    <p>      Three teachers pull out of public school. They know each      other well, seem to share common values and educational      philosophy.    </p>    <p>      Through frequent meetings they work out a detailed and      explicit set of goals which includes such things as      "fostering free expression," "recovering feelings" and      "achieving the human potential." Perhaps they talk too      much.    </p>    <p>      They write up their plans, advertise a bit, offering "a      school that's an alternative to public schools . . . for      parents willing to pay a specific fee." Within two days      they have 30 children enrolled for the following Fall.    </p>    <p>      They devise an intricate program for the school: Interest      centers for subjects, craft work areas, field trips to      forests and polluted lakes, lots of nature stuff, a garden,      and a heavy experiment with children's encounter groups.      The children get into it fast in the fall, do a lot of      playing with words about bodily processes, sex discussions.      There is much good feeling about nature in the school.    </p>    <p>      When the children begin getting heavily into dreams through      the encounter groups, some parents revolt, insisting on      control over the teachers. They reconstruct the "Board"      with teachers a minority. Then the parents threaten to fire      the teachers if they don't slow down the experiments a bit      and get on with "more academics." The rest of the parents      are passive.    </p>    <p>      The teachers all quit at the end of the first year, amidst      much bitterness. The parents by this time are beginning to      enjoy each other at potlucks and decide to "fight to keep      the school alive for the sake of the children." They form a      committee to search for new teachers but find themselves      wrangling interminably over "what should we look for in a      teacher."    </p>    <h3>      <em>Notes From The Summer Of 1970 -      July</em>		</h3>		<p>      <em>Meanwhile, back in Freestone . . .<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>. . . a hot July day, Erik outside the window singing      "on the 4th day of Christmas," Stephan designing his tipi,      Sasha reading "2001"-and we're deep into the book      now, wondering if the pain and trouble that seems to      surround free schools and "alternative education" is a      function of our perception . . .</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Our work is meant to be part of the transition, of      "living well"-shared among those of us living in      Freestone.

Together we are six children,      six adults. We will meet at one house for several days,      then at the farm for several days, sharing what we know . .      .</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We start to propose things</em> - <em>lists of      skills that people ought to know</em> - <em>from      languages to modes of expression to mastery of technical      skills. But a Now takes us over, a warm silence, and we      begin to hear the whisper's of each other's intuitions. We      remember that "primitive" peoples gave their skills to      their children by</em> being <em>what they were, with      children around</em> - <em>working, making love,      failures and joys bared, shared rituals as routes into      heartland areas</em> - <em>the need for skills, for      hard learning, simply a necessary preliminary to the real      goal of living well.

Children should be free to make whatever      reality, whatever new constructions they can make. What if      it</em> does <em>rain all the time?

Our need for an alternative school is a      reflection of our alienation from the dominant culture. But      our need for a school at all is a reflection of our      alienation from ourselves and our brothers and      sisters.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So why don't we just improve our lives?</em>    </p>    <h3>ON AFFILLIATING WITH COLLEGES,      UNIVERSITIES</h3>    <p>      Most colleges and universities have departments of      education or psychology with at least one professor (or      graduate student) vitally interested in, if not an      alternative culture, progressive education.    </p>    <p>      Seek out such persons and see if they will sponsor (or be      on the board, or at least help you) with the development of      your school.    </p>    <p>      Here are a few potential advantages gleaned from schools      who have connections:    </p>    <p>      - prestige-facilitating the dealings with local      bureaucracies<br />      - possible locations for housing the school (you'll      have to be <em>very</em> convincing, but worth a try)<br />      - free source of film rentals, projectors (the most      common use of colleges-order through the professor's      department)<br />      - use of college facilities for school benefits<br />      - sub-rosa enrollment of older kids in college      classes<br />      - use of athletic areas<br />      - source of teaching assistance<br />      - channel for seeking funds, grant applications,      etc.<br />      - printing, maybe use of mailing, telephones, office      supplies (if very discreet).<br />    </p>    <p>      The danger is obvious-you've got to dance a fine line      to keep from being assimilated into a heavy Educational      Experiment, or teacher training laboratory. (See also New      Schools Exchange Occasional Paper, "Education, the      University, and the Community" by Allen Graubard, available      through NSE)<br />    </p>    <h3>THE TRANSFER: A FREE SCHOOL FABLE</h3>    <p>      <br />      by Walter Toman<br />    </p>    <p>      Eric was setting in the middle of the streetcar, and      opposite him there was an elegant, elderly gentleman. At      the next stop several people got on and hurried to the      center in order to get a seat. But none were vacant. The      first person who came from one side was a well-dressed,      elderly lady; the first person from the other side was a      little old woman who was carrying a bundle of kindling wood      on her shoulder. The elegant gentleman sitting opposite      Eric jumped up in order to make room for the well-dressed      lady. But at the last moment he noticed that the old lady      with the sticks was about to slip into the vacant seat      behind his back, and he blocked her path. The well-dressed      lady, who had reached the seat, gave him a smile, whereupon      he tipped his hat and she sat down.    </p>    <p>      After a few seconds, during which the three people      concerned began to settle down in their new      positions-the old woman put her bundle on the floor,      the gentleman put on his gloves and reached for one of the      straps, the well-dressed lady pulled her coat down over her      knee-after a few seconds, then, Eric got up and      offered his seat to the old lady with the wood.    </p>    <p>      She was a bit surprised, but sat down immediately, and      after she had put her bundle to her knees, she moved her      hand up to Eric's face and stroked his cheek.    </p>    <p>      Eric blushed and looked to the left and to the right to see      if anyone had noticed it, for he had not wanted the caress.      Now the well-dressed lady stood up and offered her seat to      the old woman. But since this would only have meant a      change of seat for the old woman, she stayed put, but also      stroked the well-dressed lady's cheek. Dazed, the elegant      lady offered her seat to the elegant gentleman who had      given it up for her, but he refused to sit down again. She      offered her seat to Eric, and perhaps because he also      declined her offer, she stroked his cheek. She also stroked      the cheek of the elegant gentleman and Eric's again.      Thereupon the plain gentleman who had the window seat next      to the well-dressed lady jumped up and offered his seat to      her. Then the young lady who was sitting next to the woman      with the bundle offered her window seat to her and Eric      could not resist the temptation to stroke this young lady's      cheek. Smiling, the young lady stroked the cheek of the old      woman who had refused her offer, and then turning, she bent      far over the back of her seat toward the people on the back      seats and stroked the cheeks of two of them.    </p>    <p>      Suddenly it was impossible to keep the activity confined to      the center group of seats, and people on the entire      streetcar began to stroke one another and offer one another      their seats. Nobody wanted to sit down any more; but still,      some people kept getting pushed down into seats. They arose      again the moment they thought themselves unobserved, and      mingled with the tender jostling of the standees . . .All      had their cheeks stroked, everybody stroked somebody else's      cheek, and finally all were standing and all the seats were      unoccupied. Even the old woman with the wood stood up, held      her bundle in one arm, and used her other hand to      participate in the caresses which everybody was bestowing      with grear feeling. She joined gladly, for after all, she      had started it.    </p>    <p>      At length someone had the idea of letting the ticket      conductor sit down; he had already been stroked several      times, albeit with some reserve, because he was an      official. No sooner had this idea been expressed when      combined forces pushed him down into a seat, and he was      stroked with such rapidity that he threatened the many      people crowding him if they did not at least let him pull      the signal cord for the streetcar to proceed.    </p>    <p>      They reached the next stop, which was the busiest transfer      point in town, and this was where everybody got off. They      assembled together outside and waved to the conductor; the      elegant gentleman even tossed him a rather large bill. They      exchanged addresses, so that finally everybody had      everybody else's address.    </p>    <p>      During all this they continued to stroke one another      undisturbed, and the first people who had to leave stroked      the strangers they met in the street. But these people did      not understand, got angry, said something about liquor and      lunatics, and the next passers-by who were stroked by the      ex-passengers even blazed into fight with them. This so      intimidated the ex-streetcar group that they no longer      dared to stroke one another's faces, but only stroked      hands, and when Eric did stroke the cheek of the young lady      who had sat first next to him and then next to the woman      with the bundle, she even slapped his face.    </p>    <p>      That ended it all. The only things left were a few slips      with addresses which people had dropped, as well as a few      visiting cards, and even these scattered when a light      breeze blew over them.    </p>    <p>      <strong><br /></strong> <strong><em>Idea</em> <em>for a      Sequence</em></strong> <em><br /></em><br />      Center yourself, locate your culture, your context. Center      your efforts there. Ignoring common premises and values      cuts you off from your most basic source of strength,      energy and pleasure.    </p>    <p>      (Such efforts can be abstract bummers-but they      needn't be. There are authentic expressions, and phony      expressions.)    </p>    <p>      Get into it all the way. Is your coming together rooted      only in rejection of public schools? And the dominant      culture as well? Great, but to what extent are you still      dependent on it? And so on. (Schools for those who feel      their deepest values have been outraged by public schools      tend to be the most energetic in exploring-but not      necessarily living-alternatives).    </p>    <p>      Share goals. Merely breaking out is not creating. The goals      are so often new, so beyond what we can      express-sometimes because of the joy of it, sometimes      because of the fear. Sometimes words just don't work.    </p>    <p>      <em>But what do you really want?</em> For yourself. For      your children. Is your coming together for the purpose of      finding a secret agenda for the future? Have your goals      gone beyond the restraints of how you were taught-how      you learned about learning? (It's ok to have wild goals.      They'll change anyway if you let them.)    </p>    <p>      Then, the "how." How are you going to do it? By yourself?      With a group? How?    </p>    <p>      That's when it begins to get hard. It's easy to spread bull      about goals. But people's basic assumptions and beliefs      come rolling out pretty fast when they get down to the      "how." The "how" has to do with the kind of teaching,      space, and mood; how many children; where; and who will do      the dirty work. If you had no goals but you did have a      humane and coherent "how," you could still create a good      school.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>        <p>      It's something that has to be worked through-there's      no "how to" that you can read about. Whether or not your      school is ever going to be real starts at this point: when      you decide to sit down and work things out. Either with      straight out-on-the-table honesty, or devious crap.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Are you going to have experienced teachers or not? Parents      involved? How much? How many children? <em>Normal</em>      children? Where? In homes? Rented buildings? In buses (a      school without walls)? Tuition, or not? How much? How many      teachers for how many children? Why "teachers" at all? Why      a "school" at all? What's going on, anyway!    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Then, when it's flowing and you're into it warmly and      deeply, perhaps the "who"-"who's going to do this,"      and "who's going to do that"-will take care of      itself. In some schools, things just seem to happen. But      usually not, so you'll need to decide about      decision-making: who decides, who chooses among options.      Who is going to build the envelope within which the school      can thrive; who decides when and how to fend off attackers?    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Having a clear decision-making structure is another way of      avoiding buck-passing: doing time schedules; making hard      choices between too many applicants for a teaching      position; dealing with parents who won't (or can't) pay      tuition, or who leave their kids at school later and later      into the afternoons; talking with the health officials who      want to close you down. And then there's the income tax      forms to be made out for teachers; the occasional      accidents, meetings to be called, equipment to be ordered,      kids (and more frequently, parents) who fall apart on your      hands.    </p>    <p>      <em>If</em> you are going to have a <em>School</em> ,      you'll need some structure. <em>If</em> you're not to be an      isolated community-if in fact you face the human      misery, the roaring needs of those on heavy cultural      transition roads-you'll need some guides through the      hard work and difficult decisions you'll have to make.    </p>    <p>      Our bias, congruent with the Moses bent we're obviously on,      is on a "structure" focusing around a coordinator. Moses.      Someone good with long marches.    </p>        <p>      Someone granted power by the community, someone to make      day-to-day decisions (within, of course, "policy" set down      by the Board). Someone to free the teachers to float with      the children <em>full</em> <em>time.</em> Isn't that what      it's all about, learning, and loving? To be with someone      you love <em>full</em> time, even when <em>you</em> know      it's a short time? It never happens when teachers are      hassled with everything.    </p>    <p>      But it has to be organic. Someone rising into the job,      feeling right; maybe a parent, teacher, older student; a      neighbor wandering in at the right time.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <h3>DECLARATION ON THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD      LORCA</h3>    <p>      We will not send our child to a public school, or even to a      private one in the usual sense. Together we have managed to      learn much the schools couldn't teach us, and unlearn some      of what they did. The heart of our knowledge is ours now,      and it tells us we must be responsible ourselves for the      conditions of our child's growth. This is no romantic hippy      daydream. It is a full political act: grounded in theory,      chosen as strategy, implemented with all the skills of our      consciousness.    </p>    <p>      We choose to move on the future by freeing our child from      the control of the present State. We declare independence      from its essential instrument, the System of Education. We      will not give our young over to be conditioned in obedience      with its programs by any of its representatives, however      unofficial, informal and liberal. <em>We will grow our      own</em> . And we will grow them as free as we can manage,      in situations where we have only to contend with what is in      ourselves of the lives we are trying to leave behind.    </p>    <p>      Several years ago we left the Educational System, where we      were cut off from our many selves. We sidestepped the      institutions that continue it in society, and began to come      together. Now we know that other lives of learning are      possible. We can name them. Crippled as we are, we can      create their initial conditions: we understand what is      involved, and have the skills and the power. For we have      been learning to be what we imagine: to live in our bodies,      make art with our lives, realize cooperation, and fight      Fascism by any means necessary, including the creation of      alternate realities, guerilla enclaves of Life in the State      of Death.    </p>    <p>      Good life learning means understanding is integrated in      action. We display our knowledge of the culture of      specialized roles, with its destructive systems of      education, competition and authority, by how we manage to      be each other's teachers, siblings and lovers, parents and      children, by how we tend and heal and share each other's      growth. We must focus at home through this if we are to      focus anywhere else and into the future. <em>We will grow      our own</em> . And we ourselves must be directly involved      in what and how our children learn, for no one else can      represent our interest in the future.    </p>    <p>      For this we must make our lives over: rearrange the ways we      work, the styles of our play, the priorities of our time      and our love; and move beyond the roles that still bind us      from within. To replace what we reject, we must learn anew      what we have to share, and grow to make it adequate. The      price of making of our lives a school for our children is      our own transformation. We believe it is possible, because      it is already begun.    </p>    <p>      Our parents were forced to abandon their children to the      part-time uses of the State because they were integrated      into its economy and culture, because they saw no      alternative, because they were isolated in marriage and      privacy and could not organize their lives to be also a      school. We know now that no couple can cope alone with even      their own relation. We learn in a larger community. To free      our young many must come together, to share their powers in      critical mass and intimacy. We believe it involves all      entering equal as children into the School of a larger      Family.    </p>    <p>      It also means learning economic cooperation, to free space      and resources. And it means committing ourselves to      political identity and struggle. At present here, one      elementary credential can front for up to fifty kids,      leaving us with only our own limitations. But when many      choose to use this freedom it will be curtailed; and that      will be only the beginning. For Fascism is rising softly in      this land, you have seen its sign in the black headline of      the sky.    </p>    <p>      The State registered our son with a number at his birth,      and designs to own him. Our growing up prepared us for      integration into its army, its civil and industrial      bureaucracies, its systems of consumption and exploitation,      decision and power. It cannot afford us to let our son grow      unprepared, let alone prepared for something else. It will      not give him over to the gropings of our freedom without a      deadly struggle. This will take many forms. To meet them,      we must real-ize together who we are and the politics of      our necessities and choices. And prepare to resist, to      fight for the cradle of our future, and to flourish in and      beyond our resistance.    </p>    <p>      Michael and Karen Rossman    </p>    <p>      LEARNING POWER TO THE PEOPLE!    </p>    <p>      <strong><br /></strong>    </p>    <h3>ON GOALS - THE ULTIMATE</h3>    <p>      Most groups wanting a school meet a few times, hope it      feels ok, get into some business details, and get started.      A few laboriously go into goals and processes and debates      on the nature of learning. Sometimes it's just incredible      bullshit, but it's our impression that such schools,      bullshit or not, tend to be the ones that thrive. (Maybe if      you <em>talk</em> enough about it at meetings you're too      tired to bother the kids much.)    </p>    <p>      At any rate we got to wondering what it would look like if      we collected all the free-school goals we could find and      coalesced them into one grand set of Cosmic Super Goals.      Here it is:    </p>    <p><strong>"WE WANT OUR SCHOOL TO . . .</strong></p>    <p>      Build or Increase Skills-in order to be able to . . .    </p>    <p>      • Survive (in wildernesses, "dying environments,"or      "in a revolutionary future")<br />      • master the culture ("basics," "the three r's")<br />      • protect oneself from the culture<br />      • attack and change the culture<br />      • put things together ("problem solving," "reasoning,"      "creating," "learning how to learn")<br />      • share, live in groups, be responsible for yourself,      talk straight<br />      <br />      Be Therapeutic . . .    </p>    <p>      • promote health, personal growth<br />      • allow "integration of mental fragments into      gestalts<br />      • clear the decks of bad cultural debris<br />      • help fulfill children's needs (i.e., holding them      etc.).<br />      • entertaining, fun<br />      <br />      Be Anarchistic    </p>    <p>      • an adventure<br />      • free to do whatever comes up<br />      • discover stuff, explore<br />      <strong><br /></strong> Increase Perception    </p>    <p>      • of the senses<br />      • of the child's sense of the world, of nature<br />      • of other cultures<br />      <br />      <strong>Foster Spiritual Growth</strong>    </p>    <p>      • be a ground for rituals<br />      • a place for engendering myths "unique to us"<br />      • allow a sense of the holy to flow,    </p>    <h3><em>Parents Seeking Teachers</em>    </h3>    <p>      If you're a group of parents, with kids in various states      of torture at the hands of public schools and all, perhaps      after months of meetings and hashing it over, it's      <em>good</em> when you get to the part about bringing in      teachers. There are few aspects of starting schools more      pleasant, few fraught with more awkwardness.    </p>    <p>      You think you know what you want: someone warm, loving,      open, cool <em>,</em> good with kids. What then when      another family wants all that plus someone who can get some      heavy academics going as well? Sometimes the first real      below-the-surface differences are revealed at this point,      and the best skill-and love-is necessary to      work it out. Some potential schools split at this point;      others don't but should-various power games get      going, for example, one group who wants structure capturing      a teacher over those who don't. Often the game is      incredibly subtle, and you don't find out who "won" until      later.    </p>    <p>      When these issues come up it may be the first plunge off      the cliff of defining things, trying to get clear about      Educational Philosophy, and all that. (Possibly what you      <em>really</em> want is someone to make happen to your kids      all the things that didn't happen to you when you were a      child-and how can you be rational about that?)    </p>    <p>      At any rate, often a very difficult context for a search      gets built up pretty fast.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      And there will be candidates. There are hundreds of good      people advertising through New Schools Exchange and the      Teacher Drop-Out Center out of the University of      Massachusetts at Amherst.    </p>    <p>      Good people, looking for a more together life: "We're into      graphics, organic gardening, wool dying, and biology. We'll      work for what ever you can pay. Prefer a country place in      California . . . " Human, hoping for their needs to be      fulfilled, seeking community, a vehicle for making a break      with their lives.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Here's some ideas towards making it less awkward.    </p>    <p>      Don't worry about your children's relationship to the      teacher so much. <em>You</em> may be the problem. Your kids      are probably masters at dealing with bad teachers. Unless      you choose so badly that you get a bully or real      mind-freaking artist, relax about the kids and try and get      in touch with what you're feeling.    </p>    <p>      Get clear, yourself, and as a group, about what you really      want. Don't expect teachers, especially the soft flowing      people working out a new culture for themselves, to resolve      differences about life and human nature, learning and      discipline, that may exist within your group.    </p>    <p>      Take time. Self selection is, <em>profoundly,</em> better      than any rational or short-term testing method. It takes      time: for a person's true pace to come out; for a person to      sense others' paces; for fear to drop to its normal level;      to get to know people, to know if you feel right to each      other, for sharing.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      If you <em>are</em> going to examine prospective teachers,      here are some things to consider asking about. Does he or      she: view it as a job, or commitment? want parents close,      or away? (Consider the degree to which control trips are      usually masked and rationalized: the teacher who must block      out all parents or helpers "until things are set" usually      has extremely impressive reasons for doing so. But it's      still a control trip, and that will stand as the most      likely "curriculum" for your kids.) What does the candidate      expect from parents? (Cleaning up? commitment? real      partnership?) Does the prospective teacher need freedom,      space, time? Want content-or a child-centered      curriculum? What about fights, discipline, keeping      schedules?    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Consider: teaching experience, or learning; education, or      living. Teachers with verbal skills. And what children      <em>really</em> need.    </p>    <p>      People who can make it with adults. But not with kids.    </p>    <p>      Going by feel, not by words.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      The best description I ever heard of a teacher was by Jill:    </p>    <p>      "The person who accepts you completely as you are while      still being a model of a more skilled, more conscious, more      aware, and more loving person. . . "    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      And this is what the kids said they wanted in a      teacher:<br />      -He learns from us<br />      -He shows me stuff<br />      -They don't get in our way<br />      -She's there when we need her<br />      -He helps us get the stuff we need<br />      </p>		<h3>      <em>Teachers Seeking Parents</em>    </h3>    <p>      At this point in time there appears to be many      teachers-public school drop-outs or those simply      pulling the role around them in a soft new      way-looking for children to teach, more than there      are parents seeking teachers.    </p>    <p>      Thus, many teachers are starting their own schools.    </p>    <p>      There are plenty of free-school candidates around, but      parents sort of . . . prefer kids where they'll seem safe.      (How many times have we said, even recently, hedging our      bets, "The children should learn to make it in both culture      Whatever that means.)    </p>    <p>      But advertise, in underground papers, in university      communities, and hopeful parents will appear, both parent      and teacher wanting the school to be a vehicle: the      teacher, a way to make life more authentically new-culture      based; the parents perhaps a transition to a less ambiguous      posture. Somewhere in there are the kids.    </p>    <p>      Over-advertise, and you are in the unpleasant situation      of"selecting"-you can't select among people you don't      know without forcing yourself into a kind of ghastly      rationality aid superficiality, as well as ending up with a      lot of disappointed parents.    </p>    <p>      But either way, teachers who start schools are usually      "ahead" of the parents, in that they've worked through in a      very personal and direct way-at least      theoretically-the different teaching modes rooted in      the different cultures through which we're passing. And      this is a heavy load; one which frequently forces teachers      to be prematurely "wise" about what's going on. Jerry      Friedberg, discussing Lorillard Children's school,      describes the sense of distance between "staff" and parents      very vividly:    </p>    <p>      " . . . The parents came from very different background      (that had, in fact, been one of our initial goals), and      shared very little of their daily lives, perceptions, and      orientation with one another or the staff. With several      notable exception (for example, we wound up having three      parents on the staff). parents did not, could not, partake      of an organic, self-selecting, daily sharing,      working-things-through process such as the staff was      experiencing. Here was no group of close friends shaping      day-to-day common experience as part of an over-all      life-way, but rather, by virtue of being a school in the      city, a well-enough-intentioned group of heterogeneous      people pulling and tugging at one another and the staff.    </p>    <p>      " . . . Families moved away, new families came in, and      everything had to be freshly explained, built from scratch.      Operating by consensus on the basis of honesty, caring, and      sensitivity is a fragile and difficult business at best; it      requires a basic cohesion, common commitment, and a fairly      stable group whose growth is organic and gradual . . . "    </p>        <h3>      <em>Kids Seeking.. . Everything</em>    </h3>    <p>      And what to say about the growing number of kids (all over      the country, all by themselves) becoming aware of how      they're being screwed by the dominant culture's      institutions?    </p>    <p>      Perhaps this poignant phenomenon has always existed.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, the time is now, the need is vivid. Kids who      on their own are seeking free schools can use plenty of      non-exploitative help. Take them in. Help them find other      escapees with whom to work . . . and be. Help them build      envelopes. Help them with space until they learn how to win      it themselves. Then stand aside.    </p>    <p>      Offer apprenticeships. Take them into your families and      communes. There are <em>hundreds</em> of children and young      folk for every together commune in the country. Refugees      from insanity.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <h3>      <em>Early Pitfalls!</em>    </h3>    <p>      Well again, I suppose if you want to look at it that way,      you're already surrounded by Early Pitfalls by now.      Actually, that's the chief curriculum for a lot of free      schools: anticipating every potential pitfall-and      then walking right into them. If you're of such a bent,      then you've got the seeds of further trouble sown in your      first comings-together.    </p>    <p>      But there <em>are</em> some weird things that go on right      from the start. One of the great paradoxes of free schools      is the almost total absence of relevance to the children.      It starts in the planning sessions. When the children are      brought into free school meetings it is often to say the      expected crowd-pleasing diatribes against the public      schools, or whatever else the parents happen to be talking      about (kids catch onto games-for-filling esteem-needs      pretty fast). New schools almost always underestimate (1)      the immense skills a child already has by, say, five years      of age, and (2) Salli's Children's Liberation Movement      notwithstanding, their deep need for adults . . .    </p>    <p>      And some schools unnecessarily fritter away one of their      most precious aspects: the chance to uniquely reflect the      interests of a small group and thus experiment with truly      new approaches to learning. Think of it! If your school is      to be a learning place, and if each person is to be      <em>free</em> -free to learn what he wants at his own      pace-then realize how <em>different</em> and unique      your school must be to truly represent the fullest      flowering of the participants.    </p>    <p>      Another incredible thing is believing you've defined      anything in your early meetings-at least defined      anything remotely resembling what your school will be in a      few months after you open. In a brochure on starting      schools, Frank Lindenfeld, Director of Summerhill West in      Canoga Park, California, states: " . . . in the course of      the meetings the nature of the proposed school will become      defined."    </p>    <p>      We don't think you can know the "nature of the school"      until it starts (and then only if you're not looking!) The      "what-do-we-want" talk drifts easily into structure and      such talk has an insidious habit of sounding more real than      the soft, wordless flowing life the talk was supposed to      house. The main thing is to get to know each other.    </p>    <p>      For when you <em>ignore</em> vast differences in premises      (like about human beings, about how people learn, about how      groups change and so on), then those differences begin to      seem pretty real, and they divide after all. It's not the      <em>open</em> differences, it's the secret ones. Maybe the      ones you don't know about yourself most of all. It's      because of fear. You get afraid of what you can't see.    </p>        <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      <em>There are roads and paths and we're all moving, our      children faster than we are. The issue is still fluid:      which road, how fast, and with whom. Every move towards a      solid, flowing, joyful school will be easier if you have      some sense of community. Fragile new schools can rarely      carry the incredible burden of being the catalyst for a new      community. Rather, it has to be the other way around . .      .</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>But there are no good models, no one really knows      what's happening now, let alone in the future, no one knows      how to reach or make a school, the whole thing is an      incredible experiment.

Then</em> <em>your</em>      selves.    </p>    <h3>ON DIRECTORS/COORDINATORS</h3>    <p>      by Harvey Haber<br />      New Schools Exchange    </p>    <p>      Trying to write a short statement on "qualities and skills      necessary for a free-school coordinator" is like . . . I      can think of no short, concise way to write this. A fantasy      comes to mind: somewhere in a bad novel there is this nobel      Frenchwoman shouting, "You are more dreadful than a Turkish      soldier and an English official. No one on earth could      embrace you . . ." And that's about it: a combination of      English official and Turkish soldier, the ideal      coordinator-director for a free school.    </p>    <p>      Let me explain: I think that in its beginning, formative      stages, a despotism (benevolent, of course) is the most      desirable system for a new school, primarily because there      is nothing so deadly to its vital psyche than to have to      appoint committees and have meetings before acting on every      terrible little requirement that the school might have.      Free school people are so resentful and fearful of      ego-trippers and potential-powermongers that they cast      themselves into a state of frozen inactivity rather than      chance a unilateral decision by some would-be leader. No,      let the would-be leader perform the necessary bureaucratic      duties first. <em>Then</em> evolve a more democratic system      if you wish. Despotism, after all, is a flawed approach and      will die an organic death anyway. But if you're especially      apprehensive about having a despot around, choose one so      overbearingly arrogant-that one quality least      acceptable to people with pretensions of freedom-that      he will meet his demise sooner than later. He will have      served his purpose and then must be cast out with only an      infinite martyrdom to sustain himself. Then, with the      beginning administrative necessities accomplished, the new      school can comfortably strive for that coveted balance, the      communal no-one-at-the-helm mood. (Or, retain the arrogant      director and learn to love despotism - like      Summerhill or Christianity . . .)    </p>
