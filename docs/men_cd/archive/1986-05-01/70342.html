    <p>
                        <p>      Statistics show that a house protected by an intrusion      alarm is less likely to be burglarized than one that lacks      such a device. And, beyond the personal security that a      burglar alarm can provide for you and your family, many      insurance companies offer reduced rates to homeowners who      install them. In fact, some underwriters even demand that      an alarm system be present before they'll issue a policy.    </p>    <p>      Recognizing that many of our readers would be interested in      building their own effective, economical security alarm, we      put electronics expert TJ Byers to work designing one.      After several prototypes (the schematics for which would      make your head spin), TJ has come up with an alarm that's      relatively easy to assemble, inexpensive, and does the job.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by TJ Byers    </h5>    <p>      Just because this is a comparatively simple device to build      doesn't mean that it's a stripped-down, bare-bones alarm      system. MOTHER's Security Alarm has features normally found      only in more expensive security systems-including an      adjustable exit and entrance timer, a built-in loop      test circuit, an optional 12-volt triggered output, and a      set of external relay contacts.    </p>    <p>      The exit timer allows you to set the alarm and leave      through a protected door without tripping the alarm. The      entrance timer is very similar to the exit timer, except      that it allows you to enter the building through a selected      door without triggering the alarm. Both timers are      individually adjustable from a few seconds to several      minutes-more than enough time for you to get your act      together and make a graceful exit or entrance. If the      system isn't secured within the specified time periods, a      warning bell or siren sounds, thus preventing unwanted      entry by persons not familiar with the disarming procedure.    </p>    <p>      The timed exit and entrance features save you the hassle of      carrying a special alarm key. This approach is also more      secure, because there's no key to lose or have stolen.      Furthermore, only one portal is monitored by the exit and      entrance timers. Should anyone attempt to enter through any      other protected opening, the alarm would sound immediately.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's Security Alarm includes another timer that resets      the system five minutes after it's been triggered. The      system can only be reset, however, if all the protection      devices are intact and working. A faulty device or door      that is left ajar locks out this timer, so the alarm will      continue to sound until the situation is corrected.    </p>    <h3>      HOW IT WORKS    </h3>    <p>      MOTHER's Security Alarm is a wired alarm system. Such      systems-as opposed to new wireless systems such as      ultrasonic detectorshave been around for many years and      have proved themselves very reliable.    </p>    <p>      Basically, the concept of a wired system is that of a      sensor wire stretched around the perimeter of the area to      be protected. The wire loop is routed so that it bridges      doorways and crosses windows. A small current runs through      the loop; as long as it isn't interrupted, the perimeter is      secure. In this state, the alarm is in the standby, or      armed, mode. Opening a protected door or window, however,      interrupts the flow of current, which activates a relay in      the alarm.    </p>    <h3>      BUILDING THE SYSTEM BOARD    </h3>    <p>      The heart of the security alarm is a system board that      contains all the necessary electronics. While it is      possible to construct the system board using different      wiring techniques, I recommend that you use a printed      circuit board. Printed circuit boards minimize wiring      errors while providing a standard layout that has been      proved stable and reliable. You can duplicate the circuit      board yourself using the pattern shown in Fig. 1 (see issue      84, page 136 for instructions on making circuit boards), or      purchase one from the supplier mentioned in the parts list.    </p>    <p>      To make your own, simply locate the parts according to the      layout in the photo, and solder them in place. Pay      particular attention to the polarity of the capacitors,      LEDs, and integrated circuits. There are two ways in which      they can be aligned with the holes in the board, but only      one orientation is correct. Also note that the transformer      is secured on the opposite side of the board from the other      components.    </p>    <p>      The completed board mounts in a plastic box. The board      rests parallel with the lid of the box, which becomes the      front panel of the alarm. You'll need to drill five holes      in the lid to accommodate the reset switch and the four      indicator lamps. Fastening a terminal strip to the bottom      of the case completes construction.    </p>    <h3>      INSTALLING THE ALARM    </h3>        <p>      Installation consists of nothing more than running two      loops of wire-one for the timed entry/exit and the other      for the rest of the openings in your house-to and from the      central controller. The main loop, of course, must include      all parts of the perimeter to be protected.    </p>    <p>      Before beginning to wire your structure for alarm      protection, take a few minutes to map out the areas to be      protected. This step is particularly important because it      forces you to consider the protected area as a whole. Look      for all possible entrances from the outsideeven those that      seem trivial, such as skylights-and place them on      your map. At this time, you should also pick out the door      you'll use for the timed entry, and consider carefully what      the most practical (yet hidden) location for the central      unit might be.    </p>    <p>      Once you have a plan, you'll need to decide which type of      security device is right for each entrance. Doors, for      example, require a reed switch-magnet combination. The      sensor is a reed switch mounted to the door frame; a magnet      to activate the switch attaches to the door. Only when the      door is securely closed will the magnet engage the switch      and complete the loop.    </p>    <p>      Windows can be protected using a number of devices,      including reed switch/magnet combinations or microswitches.      Adhesive foil or vibration sensors are often used to detect      a broken window.    </p>    <p>      There's a broad selection of sensors and protection devices      available, and each is specifically designed to fill a      certain security need. Just make sure that the devices you      use are of the normally closed type. That is, they form a      complete circuit in the protected state and go open when      disturbed.    </p>    <p>      After you have a map showing your security points, start      from the central controller and draw a continuous line that      connects all the points (except the timed door) and returns      to the controller. Make the line as short as possible; it      will actually become your loop wire, and planning will save      you both effort and expense.    </p>    <p>      Wherever possible, hide the loop wires. The less obvious      your installation is, the harder it will be for a would-be      thief to defeat the system. Besides, there's no need to      deface the decor of your building simply because you're      installing a burglar alarm.    </p>    <p>      Finally, return the line to the controller. This is your      security loop, with all points within the loop wired in      series starting from the controller and returning to it.      All devices within this loop are wired to the MAIN LOOP      inputs.    </p>    <p>      The timed loop is wired in a similar fashion, but goes from      the TIMED LOOP connectors out to your timed entry and back      again.    </p>    <h3>      USING THE ALARM    </h3>    <p>      The alarm has been simplified to the point where only a      single control switch is needed to test and arm the system.      This switch is located to the left of the indicator lamps.      In the OFF position, the alarm is completely disabled. The      center position of the control switch is used to TEST the      security loops. A semiconductor indicator called an LED      (Light Emitting Diode) is wired into each loop. When all      security devices and the timed entry are in the "safe"      state, both LEDs glow.    </p>        <p>      If there's a break in the system, though, one or both lamps      will fail to light, and it will be impossible to arm the      alarm until the break is closed.    </p>    <p>      The ARM position of the control switch actually turns the      system on. Until this point, no amount of tugging on the      sensors can make the system sound. Moving the switch from      the TEST position to the ARM position starts the exit      timer, which delays the actual arming of the system by 60      seconds. If all is secure after the 60-second time-out      period, the alarm arms itself and begins the job of      monitoring the perimeter.<br />    </p>    <p>      A break in the main loop automatically trips the alarm. If      this breach is secured, the alarm resets itself within five      minutes, and the vigil begins anew. Entry through the timed      door, however, initiates another sequence of events. A      break in this loop starts an entrance timer. This feature      gives you an opportunity to unlock the door, put down your      packages, and still have time to reach the disarm switch      before the alarm sounds. Failure to reset the alarm before      the entry time expires triggers the alarm relay.    </p>    <h3>      OUTPUT OPTIONS    </h3>    <p>      The relay contacts are wired so that there are several      options to signal when the perimeter circuit has been      broken. First, MOTHER's alarm contains a pair of      uncommitted relay contacts. These contacts can be used to      switch external devices on or off. Among the potential      applications is the use of these contacts to turn on indoor      room lights or outdoor floodlights. For the more      sophisticated user, the relay contacts can be used to dial      a telephone or activate other security devices.    </p>        <p>      In addition to the relay, the security system provides a      triggered 12-volt output Vol tage. [EDITOR's NOTE: A      separate 12-volt transformer and rectifier are required for      this option.] The voltage is available only after the alarm      is tripped and may be used to sound bells, sirens, or      whistles. Anything that can be powered by 12 volts may be      operated by this output.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's Security Alarm is as electronically sophisticated      as systems costing many hundreds of dollars more. By      building it yourself, you can enjoy the personal      satisfaction and the peace of mind of knowing your home is      protected-and all for less than the price of an evening      out!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: We'll freely admit it, there's just no way      we can fully detail a project of this magnitude in a few      magazine pages. If you've dabbled in electronics before, we      think you'll be able to build MOTHER's Security Alarm from      the information in this article. (You experts can also      obtain a schematic for free by sending your request and a      self-addressed stamped envelope to TMEN Reader's Service,      P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, NC 28793.) If you're new to      fiddling with circuits, however, a little more assistance      might well be appreciated. Consequently, we're offering a      set of plans for MO THER's Security Alarm that provides      much more detail on points that were, because of space      limitations, condensed in the article.    </p>    <p>      The plans are in 8" X 10" pamphlet format and include      instructions for adjusting the exit and entry timers,      troubleshooting the system, and wiring optional      configurations for the alarm output. They also provide a      comprehensive list of sensor devices normally used with      closed-loop alarm systems, along with a list of retail      suppliers, many of whom are willing to lend assistance      should you run into problems. The plans will be available      June 1, 1986, and you can get a set by sending $10 to      MOTHER's Security Alarm Plans, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville,      NC 28793.    </p>    <p>      If you'd rather not be bothered with soldering irons,      circuit boards, and the associated electronic hoopla and      legerdemain, there's yet another option available. At the      bottom of the parts list, you'll find information on      ordering an assembled circuit board at a very reasonable      price.    </p>		        <p>      An etched and drilled printed circuit board is available      from Danocinths, Inc., P.O.
