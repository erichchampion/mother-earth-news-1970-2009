                    <h5 id="byline">      by Alice M. Geffen and Carole Berglie    </h5>    		<p>      A few years ago, while smacking our lips at our favorite      annual chicken barbecuegiven by the Cutchogue (New York)      Fire Department-we began to think that there must be      thousands of such local food celebrations and festivals all      over the country. We decided to explore this premise . . .      and proceeded to eat our way through the calendar and      across America.    </p>		<p>• Food festivals combine the excitement of a celebration    with the fresh taste of local foods and the honesty of    homemade preparations. In the era of potato flakes and    imitation bacon bits, it's comforting to have the real thing.<br />    • Festivals range in length from one day to two weeks, and    they're ideal entertainment for whole families. There's    always something special going on for children, but there are    also events and activities for retired people, locals,    tourists, singles, and teenagers. Many festivals have a    midway, often set off to the side. Almost all have at least    one stage, for concerts, contests, and award ceremonies.    Starting in the 1970s, many festivals added a foot race, some    of which are officially sanctioned, but all of which attract    an astonishing number of runners. Some festivals are    agricultural fairs, so they have judgings for the    best-looking livestock or produce. Many have eating contests,    which are usually embarrassing but always a lot of fun.    Others have zany events like bed races or crazy costumes, and    most have beauty pageants. We've also seen our share of    tractor pulls, mud hops, and tug-of-wars. <br /> • Food festivals are    fun and joyous. They celebrate harvest and bounty. They are    America letting loose for a party. We have tried to    communicate some of that fun to you. We hope you'll go to    lots of them and eat yourself silly and have a great time    doing it.<br /> • Jambalaya (JAM-bah-lie-ah) found its way into    Creole-Cajun cookery in the late eighteenth century. It can    be made with ham, chicken, sausage, fresh pork, shrimp, and    oysters (all together or separately), to which shortening,    rice, onions, garlic, pepper, and other seasonings, and    sometimes tomatoes, are added. And, as anyone from East    Ascension Parish will tell you, it's best made in Gonzales.</p>    <p>      The atmosphere at Gonzales harks back to old-fashioned      church fairs. In the nineteenth century, such fairs in      southern Louisiana towns were large public gatherings.      People brought their black iron pots from home,      parishioners donated the ingredients, open wood fires were      built, and jambalaya was made and served to the crowd.      Later, politicians took over the custom and served      jambalaya at rallies.    </p>    <p>      But people don't come to the Jambalaya Festival for      politics. They come to listen and dance to Cajun music, to      watch the cooking contest, and to eat the prizewinning      jambalaya.    </p>    <p>      The contestants must supply their own 30-gallon cast-iron      cooking pot (at one time, these pots were used for      laundry). Just about all the entrants are men, mostly      two-man teams sponsored by local companies or      organizations. They take turns tending the pot and the wood      fire below it, and when it is time to give their jambalaya      a stir, they use a long-handled spatula to lift and sift      the ingredients, being careful not to break or mash the      rice kernels.    </p>    <p>      In contrast to the main cooking contest, the mini-jambalaya      contest calls for somewhat different cooking skills. These      cooks have to put a mighty effort into producing a zesty      half cup of jambalaya, using a one-quart cast-iron pot and      cooking it over a fire of kindling. The small fire gets      very hot, and the contestants must make their brew along      the curb of the main street as the crowds hang over them.      Though originally begun as a novelty, this contest is also      difficult to win, and competition is mighty stiff.    </p>    				<p>      As we downed forkfuls of jambalaya, the joyous sounds of      Cajun music came in through the wide doors of the      cafeteria, and the happy, slightly discordant waltzes got      people's feet tapping and hips swaying. We realized then      why we love Louisiana's food festivals the most: They      represent the traditional French love of good food, the      Spanish love of good drink, and the Cajun love of their      slogan, "Lais sez les bon temps rouler!"    </p>    <p>      The Gonzales Jambalaya Festival is held the second weekend      in June. There is no admission charge. Food booths sell      everything except jambalaya, which can only be had in the      cafeteria. A plate (servings are very large) costs $3.50.      Gonzales is located about 15 miles south of Baton Rouge,      off U.S. 61. For more information, contact the Jambalaya      Festival Association, P.O. Box 1243, Gonzales, LA 70737.    </p>    <p>      Imagine walking through an orchard on a sunny day, picking      sweet cherries and popping them in your mouth. Sounds      wonderful, doesn't it? On Michigan's Old Mission Peninsula,      where there's an especially large concentration of cherry      trees, you can make this dream come true. We didat the      National Cherry Festival.    </p>    <p>      The best cherries around were either still in the orchard      or part of the Very Cherry Luncheon, which is held on the      Friday of this week-long festival. Here a visitor can enjoy      a cherryfilled meal beginning with a cold cherry soup,      followed by a variety of main courses, salads, and breads      that contain cherries, and topped off with a selection or      two from the three-tiered dessert table. This buffet table      is the highlight of the luncheon, and with good reason.      Heaped high from one end to the other, it is a cornucopia      of old-fashioned cakes, pies, puddings, and cookies      prepared by the growers' families-a cherry-lover's fantasy      come true.    </p>    <p>      Other hits of the Cherry Festival include a pie-eating      contest, open to children of all ages, and a pit-spitting      competition, won recently by Rick "Pellet Gun" Krause, who      sent a cherry stone flying 53 feet 7-1/2 inches.    </p>    <p>      Another feature of the festival is the cherry orchard tour,      and this will get you among the trees so that you can start      eating. The buses take you to a farm (a family operation)      high on a hill overlooking both Grand and Little Traverse      Bays, where you're given a tractor ride between rows of      sweet cherry trees. We found this tour to be the most fun      of the festival.    </p>    <p>      The National Cherry Festival is held in Traverse City the      week following July 4. There are events, contests, and      orchard tours daily. The Very Cherry Luncheon, on Friday,      is $7.00 for adults and $4.50 for children.    </p>    <p>      Traverse City is located on Grand Traverse Bay, about 185      miles north of Lansing, off U.S. 31. Sleeping Bear Dunes      National Lakeshore is nearby (25 miles) and is definitely      worth a visit. For more information, write National Cherry      Festival, P.O. Box 141, Traverse City, MI 49684.    </p>    <p>      An oak- and eucalyptus-shaded park the size of a small town      is the setting for this very large food festival, a      three-day event that is world famous for its singleminded      devotion to the "scented pearl."    </p>            <p>      We eased into the fair and strolled among the booths, which      were selling a host of items derived from, or based on,      garlic. One stand featured Garlique, a fragrance made from      garlic extract with rose scent added; the flier noted, "He      may forget your name, but he'll know you've been there."    </p>    <p>      We moved along quickly to Gourmet Alley, a central area of      major food booths run by the festival organizers. It is      here, under a huge tent, that the large-scale cooking goes      on and the best foods are offered. There are six      specialties, and they rarely vary: marinated and stuffed      mushrooms, pasta con pesto, pepper steak sandwich, scampi,      calamari, and a vegetable stirfry with garlic bread.    </p>    <p>      Not far from Gourmet Alley, in a ring surrounding the      demonstration area, are additional food booths. Here we      sampled some other garlic offerings: garlots, garlic      tamales, garlic-fried ravioli, escargot kebabs (three      escargots and two mushrooms on a skewer, dripping with      garlic butter), pickled garlic, garlic jelly,      and-yes-garlic ice cream!    </p>    <p>      Why all the fuss about garlic in Gilroy? The Garlic      Festival was begun in 1979 to boost Gilroy's image as a      garlicproducing and processing area, and it has succeeded      in bringing upward of 110,000 people here each year to      discover countless uses for garlic. Will Rogers described      Gilroy as "the only town in America where you can marinate      a steak by hanging it on the clothesline," but these Gilroy      folks have turned a liability into an asset. The air does      have an intense smell that strains your patience, but this      festival is one of the most sophisticated we've ever      attended.    </p>        <p>      The Gilroy Garlic Festival is held July 25-27. An admission      fee ($5 for adults, $1 for children, $2 for senior      citizens) is charged and is good for the whole day.    </p>    <p>      Gilroy is located about 100 miles south of San Francisco,      off U.S. 101; just follow your nose! For more information,      contact the Gilroy Garlic Festival, P.O. Box 2311, Gilroy,      CA 95020.    </p>    <p>      "We start the fire with cedar to get the heat up, then put      on the alder to keep the coals." That's how the Sequim      (pronounced skwim) Rotarians began describing their      Indian-style salmon bake. They've been doing it this way      since 1969, following methods developed by the Northwest      Coast Indians centuries earlier.    </p>    <p>      A day or two before the bake, one of the Rotarians comes in      and rototills a small patch of the lawn by the Grange's      main building. Then some members of the group lay a bed of      sand a foot thick, which will hold the heat when the fire      gets going well. By seven o'clock the morning of the bake      the men begin to assemble, and while the fire crew gets the      coals going, the rest are busy preparing the 2,400 pounds      of king (chinook) and silver (coho) salmon. First the fish      are split open and the heads and tails removed. Then they      are boned, butterflied, and carefully placed on long cedar      stakes, tail end down. The stakes have been split in half      almost from end to end, but the closed end serves as a      hinge, and the slab of salmon is slipped between the two      halves of the stake, then pinned to crosspieces so that the      fish is spreadeagled on the stake. The fish are given a      liberal dose of salt and cracked whole pepper, then set      into the sandy bed alongside the fire. By this time the      heat of the fire is a steady 150 degrees. As stake after      stake of salmon is added, the rows of fish begin to look      like a stockade surrounding the fire. Walking around this      stockade, you can see the silver skins of the salmon      glisten as they are slowly baked.    </p>    <p>      "You got to have the angle just right," we were told, "so      that there's no dripping off the fins. If the fins drip,      the fish is cooking too fast and the oils go out. Can't      cook the fish too fast." The cooking crew sees to      that-walking the fire, they call it-watching      each one and making whatever adjustments seem necessary:      restaking, turning, or moving the fish from the front row      to the back. Periodically they check the heat of the fire      by holding their hands over it, and after about two hours,      when the salmon are nearly baked, the fish are turned so      that their skin side faces the fire and the heat gives it a      last-minute crispness.    </p>        <p>      This salmon bake is one of several held in the Pacific      Northwest, and one of the few that are truly      "Indian-style." It is a fitting way to prepare this king of      fish, producing a moist, mildly smoky fish with a very      crisp skin. The bake is held in August, when the fish that      is served is ocean-caught. The salmon have only just      begun to muster strength for the return to their freshwater      birthplaces. Thus they are juicy and plump-perfect      for baking.    </p>    <p>      Dinner is plentiful: cole slaw, beans, buttered bread, and      of course the salmonabout a pound apiece; and we were asked      if we wanted more! Everyone sits at long tables under sunny      skies enjoying themselves while L.J.'s Reminiscers play      old-time songs.    </p>    <p>      The Sequim Salmon Bake is held at Prairie Grange, Macleay      Hall, Sequim, on the second Sunday in August. Tickets are      $6 and are available at the gate. The bake is from noon to      6:00 P.M.    </p>    <p>      Sequim is on the Olympic Peninsula, about 17 miles east of      Port Angeles on U.S. 101. For more information, write the      Sequim Chamber of Commerce, P.O. Box 907, Sequim, WA 98382.    </p>    <p>      The International Zucchini Festival is probably the      funniest food festival around. But then, zucchini can      become a pretty funny vegetable. If you've grown your own,      you know what we mean-especially at the end of the summer.      By August, you've given zucchini away to all your friends,      relatives, and neighbors. You've made zucchini pickles,      zucchini hash, and zucchini ice cream.    </p>    <p>      And that's just when the International Zucchini Festival      comes along-perfect timing. You and your zucchini can do      things together. You can enter it into competitions such as      the Farthest Traveled Zucchini or the Longest or Heaviest      Zucchini. You can make something of your zucchini and enter      it as the Best Zucchini Needlework or the Best Off-Color      Zucchini. If you have more than one, there's the Best      Matched Zucchini. And if you have only inspiration left,      there's the Best Zucchini Essay.    </p>    <p>      If you have been able to grow more than just zucchini this      summer, you could enter the Best Vegetable "Old Masters"      Reproduction or the Most Peaceful Use of a Vegetable.      Should your talents lie in the performing arts, open to you      would be the Best Vegetable Song (but you must sing it      before an appreciative audience).    </p>    <p>      Should your zucchini not feel up to entering an      agricultural exhibit, perhaps you should consider the      Motorized Vegetable competitions or the Flight of the      Airborne Vegetables. Of course the Greased Zucchini Toss is      a crowd pleaser, but your vegetable might not care for it.    </p>    <p>      For the athletic, there's a Vegetable Olympics, including a      Pentathlon-five events performed with five different      vegetables. The Zucchini Power Lifting competition calls      upon the strong to lift crates filled with zucchini. For      the Vegetable Diving Con test, entrants stand on the end of      a diving board; they execute the dive by tossing the      vegetable into the center of the pool. The dive is judged      on accuracy, entry into the water, and form. There is also      a Regatta, with prizes for both the zucchini boat that      sinks the fastest and the one that stays afloat the      longest.    </p>        <p>      We assembled the makings for lunch from the various food      booths that were scattered about: icy-cold gazpacho,      grilled lamburgers and lamb sausage heros served with      sauteed zucchini and onions, and gingered spareribs and      lamb kebabs with rice and zucchini. Dessert was a slice of      zucchini bread spread with cream cheese. Food is purchased      with Zukes and Gadzukes, the currency of the festival. And      there are many signs warning, NO CUKES!    </p>        <p>      This zany festival takes place in Keene, New Hampshire, on      the campus of Keene State College, on August 23. There is a      $3 admission ($1 for children); Zukes (25e) and Gadzukes      ($1) are on sale and are used to purchase food, crafts,      balloons, face painting, and so on.    </p>    <p>      Keene is in the southwestern corner of the state, about 90      miles northwest of Boston, off Route 101. For information,      contact the International Zucchini Festival, P.O. Box 128,      Harrisville, NH 03450; 603/827-3033.    </p>    <p>      The road to Lebanon cuts across the knobland of central      Kentucky, to the county named for General Francis Marion,      the Swamp Fox of the Revolutionary War. On a late-September      morning, the fields glisten from an early frost, and in the      tobacco barns the drying leaves hang like bats in a cave.      The air is heady as the road nears the bourbon      distilleries. Warehouses filled with barrels of aging      bourbon resemble prisons-tall, straightsided, metalclad      buildings with bars on the windows and chain link fences      around the perimeters.    </p>        <p>      Sour mash bourbon and tobacco are Kentucky traditions. So      is real country ham. Marion County celebrates its ham      tradition with a glorious two-day festival featuring a      "pigasus" parade; pig calling, pipe smoking, and tobacco      spitting contests; an auction of the champion ham; a 10 km      "pokey pig" run; country music; crafts exhibits; and a      country ham breakfast that rivals the best. The streets of      downtown Lebanon are cordoned off, and tables are set up in      front of City Hall for the breakfast. And the crowds eat.      Five hundred volunteers serve fried apples, scrambled eggs,      country ham with red-eye gravy, sliced tomatoes, and      biscuits to hungry guests.    </p>    <p>      If your only experience with ham has been a tasteless,      brine-cured, boiled ham, you're in for a real surprise.      These somewhat saltier hams are dry-cured with a salt rub      for six weeks, then rinsed and rubbed with sugar and smoked      for a few hours over hickory chips. They then are aged for      from six months to two years.    </p>    <p>      If you need a little diversion between ham biscuits,      there's the chance to tour the Maker's Mark distillery, a      few miles away. This is the only distillery in the United      States granted National Historic Landmark status, and even      if you aren't a bourbon fan the tour is well worth the      trip. (There are no samples or sales at the distillery;      it's against the law.) Marion County Ham Days are the last      weekend of September. Tickets for the breakfast cost $4.50.    </p>    <p>      Lebanon, Kentucky, is about 60 miles southwest of      Lexington, off U.S. 68. For more information, contact the      Lebanon/Marion County Chamber of Commerce, Lebanon, KY      40033: 512/ 692-2661.    </p>    <p>      The Indians had many uses for the native American      cranberry. In addi tion to eating the berries, they used      the juice for a red dye when weaving, and a cranberry      poultice was fairly common for treating arrow wounds. They      shared this crisp, red fruit with the early English      settlers, and cranberries have been a part of Thanksgiving      Day feasts ever since 1621.    </p>    <p>      The cranberry is a low-growing vine that thrives in peat      and sand. At harvest time (late September) the bogs are      often flooded. The ripe berries are then knocked off the      vines (by the harvesters) so that they float to the      surface, creating vast crimson patches all over the flooded      area. Dry harvesting, done with the old-fashioned scoop (or      rake), is another method but less favored.    </p>    <p>      The Massachusetts Cranberry Festival, begun in 1948, is      held in South Carver each September. This is the heart of      cranberry country, with over 3,000 acres of cranberry bogs.      The site is the Edaville Railroad Park, a family amusement      center with a cranberry bog in the middle. There is a      narrowgauge railroad that encircles the bog, and a      highlight of the festival is a 45-minute ride on the      old-fashioned train. The railroad was originally      constructed to serve the bogs: hauling sand out to them in      the winter and bringing the harvest back in the fall.    </p>    <p>      Other events at the festival include the woodsmen's      competition, a sheeptoshawl spinning and weaving contest, a      puppet theater, and a spinning bee. Under the Cranberry      Tent you can watch cranberry-screening and      cranberry-cooking demonstrations (with samples for the      tasting) and refresh yourself with glasses of free      cranberry juice.    </p>    <p>      Along the walkways that encircle the central cranberry bog,      one can find other, delicious diversions: a chicken      barbecue served with cranberry sauce (what else?), a local      bake sale featuring cranberry cakes-some of them past      winners in the cooking contest, and all of them      irresistibleand a stand selling cranberry sherbet. There is      also an arts and crafts sale.    </p>        <p>      The Cranberry Festival (and 4-H Fair) is held the last two      weekends in September at the Edaville Railroad in South      Carver, Massachusetts. Admission to the grounds (which      includes a train ride) is $5 for adults, $3 for children.    </p>    <p>      South Carver is about 15 miles southwest of Plymouth, on      Route 58. For more information, contact the Massachusetts      Cranberry Festival, P.O. Box 7, South Carver, MA 02366.    </p>    <p>      "Mullet? Where I come from even the cats won't eat it."      This is what one man from Florida told us. Of course, in      some parts of the state the shoreline is muddy, and so the      mullet, which are bottom feeders, taste a lot like what      they eat. Mullet are considered trash fish in a lot of      places, but along the Boggy Bayou on the Florida panhandle,      they're eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.    </p>    <p>      The Florida mullet is the migratory Mugil cephalus,      commonly called the black, silver, or striped mullet      because of the long black lines that run the length of its      body. It has a tapered nose that broadens out to a flat,      wide head. When it feeds along a shallow bottom, its tail      points skyward. The mullet is a fish that can make a rapid      switch from salt water to fresh water by making a chemical      change in its body that science has yet to understand. It      leaves the Gulf of Mexico and swims up the shallow bayous      each year to spawn.    </p>        <p>      During the third weekend in October, the friendly people of      Niceville hold a festival to show the rest of the world      just how tasty mullet can be. The Boggy Bayou Boys-a local      sportsmen's club-fix the mullet in two very appealing ways.      The fried is the most popular, and it's easy to know why.      They head the fish, split them open, and remove the bones.      Then they butterfly the fillets, dust them faintly with a      mixture of flour and cornmeal, and fry them in vegetable      oil. The fish emerges virtually greaseless and very crisp,      especially around the edges. It's served either with just      hush puppies, or on a platter with cheese grits, beans, and      hush puppies.    </p>    <p>      The smoked mullet has also been headed, cleaned, and boned.      It's then sprinkled with lemon juice, Worcester shire      sauce, and melted butter. T! fish is given a "heat      smoke"-mo a combination of smoking an      cooking-for an hour to an hour an a half. When the      fish starts to chang color, the cooks baste it with more      the lemon juice mixture.
