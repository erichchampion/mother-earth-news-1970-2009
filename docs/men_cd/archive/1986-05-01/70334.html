            		    <p>      Full-length continuous hinges are attractive and support      the door frames evenly; they're fastened to the inner      stiles. Cutting 1/2" X 1/2" rabbets into the door frames      creates enough recess to accommodate the mirror glass, the      backing, and the retaining strips.    </p>		        <p>      <em>Through mortise and tenon joints at the</em> <em>door      corners are easy to make and offer a pleasing contrast      between side and end grain. The joints are pinned with      short wire brads. Magnetic catches are used because they're      in expensive and self-aligning.</em>    </p>		    <p>      Whether you rent or own your home, you probably have a      particular something in common with the rest of us: an ugly      medicine cabinet. In fact, if you were to run a survey of      new construction, you might become convinced that there's      no reasonably priced alternative to the stamped-steel,      refrigerator-white box.    </p>    <p>      Enter MOTHER's woodworkers. Our contribution to the war      against "hospital decor" is made from oak and has enough      storage space to cache a lifetime supply of pills, blades,      and toiletries. The two outer mirrors hinge on the inside,      so they can be swung inward for proper primping.      And-unlike some three-mirror models we've      seen-the center door is also hinged to allow access      to the compartment behind.    </p>    <h3>      WHY THESE DIMENSIONS?    </h3>		    <p>      Though we chose to mount our medicine cabinet on the      surface of the wall, the 44" width makes it comparatively      easy to recess the unit into a conventional 2 X 4 stud      wall. One or two studs must be cut, and headers have to be      installed above and below the cabinet. (To meet your local      code, you may need to double-frame the jambs and headers in      load-bearing walls.) Then the gap on each side of the      cabinet will allow shimming to correct for out-of-plumb      studs. (If you don't get the cabinet plumb, the doors will      swing open to remind you.) Although the 3-7/8" stock width      on the cabinet frame may seem a little odd at first, it      will allow the main frame to recess into a standard 3-1/2"      wall with 3/8" drywall so that the rear of the cabinet is      flush with the adjoining wall. However, if you are      recessing the cabinet into a wall with a thicker drywall or      into a plumbing wall (which has thicker studs), you'll want      to back the cabinet with 1/8" lauan or Masonite, instead of      installing the cleat shown in the illustration. (Otherwise,      your Contact may be swallowed up by your stud wall.)    </p>    <h3>      A COUPLE OF TIPS    </h3>				    <p>      There are several possible approaches to cutting the joints      for the cabinet, but a table saw with an adjustable dado      really makes the work go quickly. You'd set the dado for a      3/4" width to cut the frame grooves, 5/8" for the shelf      track grooves, and 1/2" for the mirror .recesses and the      mortises and tenons at the door corners. Don't let the door      joints intimidate you; they're much easier to make than      they seem to be at first glance. One hint, though: If you      use softwood, make the ripped mirror recesses after doing      the crosscutting, because there's a greater likelihood of      tearout when crosscutting.    </p>    <p>      Also, if you decide to surface-mount the medicine      chest, check the wall to see if it's flat before you hang      the cabinet. Many a drywall has bows or waves that are hard      to see until something flat is set against it. If your wall      does turn out to have this problem, try installing a second      cleat at the bottom of the cabinetbetween the frame members      for the center compartment will be sufficient-so that      you can pull the bottom and the top of the frame firmly      against the wall. Locate the studs, and anchor the cabinet      to them with No. 12 X 21/4" screws.    </p>    <h3>     OFF THE SHELF    </h3>		    <p>      We had a tough time settling on a material to make the      shelves. Many commercial cabinets have beveled,      double-strength glass shelves, but we were too nervous      about prying little hands to use anything that might      shatter. What we really wanted was tempered glass.      Unfortunately, our area glass distributor wanted $8.00 for      each cut (the glass is actually cut and then tempered),      bringing the total hardware bill to well over a hundred      bucks. We cut the cost of materials, excluding lumber, to      $63.79 by using clear 1/4" acrylic glazing (often known by      the brand name Plexiglas). The plastic will scratch in      time, but it's safe.    </p>    <h3>      FINISH    </h3>		    <p>      The humid environment of a bathroom can produce dramatic      expansion problems in woodwork. With this in mind, we set      aside our favored oil finish and applied polyurethane      varnish to our medicine cabinet.    </p>    <p>      Minwax natural stain helped accentuate the grain of the      oak, and three thorough coats of the plastic finish were      applied on top of that. The goal of finishing, in this      case, is to seal the wood as much as possible, so that      changing humidity won't alter the wood's moisture content      and loosen joints from the continual expansion and      shrinkage encountered in the ever-changing bathroom      environment.    </p>    <h3>      "GOOD MORNING, MIRROR!"    </h3>    <p>      For many of us, the first few minutes of a new day aren't      the easiest. If you're a member of the morning fog clan,      perhaps it will help to contemplate a fine example of your      own handiwork when you reach for your toothbrush.    </p>
