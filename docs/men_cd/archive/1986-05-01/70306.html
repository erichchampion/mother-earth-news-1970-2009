                <p>      Last issue we told you how to combat erosion on your land.      This sequel shows how you can . . .    </p>    <p>      <em>Photos Courtesy of the US Soil Conservation Service and      the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources</em>    </p>            <p>      A "well-behaved" brook can produce energy; water for crops,      livestock, or and fish for food and re- creation. people;      creation. A degraded one, on the other hand, detracts from      the appearance of its surround ings and-during and just      after a flood-can endanger life and property, as well as ab      sconding with chunks of irreplaceable soil.    </p>    <p>      Floods and massive soil erosion naturally bring to mind      another virtue of a wellmannered stream: its ability to      carry excess water off the land in an orderly fashion. A      stream, however, isn't the only thing that can perform that      function. There's that human invention known as a ditch.      Far too often, when a stream fails to dispose of its load      of water efficiently, we tend to think of it as a      malfunctioning ditch. We even discipline rowdy streams into      monotonous canals through the process called      channelization: straightening and deepening the streambed      and removing all obstructions to flow.    </p>        <p>      This often "works" in controlling the flooding and      erosion-if you don't care about fish, wildlife, aesthetics,      or recreation, and if you can justify dumping your problem      on people downstream.    </p>    <p>      You can stop streams from flooding or changing course over      the years without resorting to heroic engineering feats.      You can also prevent changes in course and water level from      occurring so abruptly that the carrying capacity of the      land-for everything from wildlife to agriculture to      housing-is reduced with each rain.    </p>    <h3>      GREAT OR SMALL?    </h3>    <p>      Whatever the size of your stream-and the scale of your      project-the same basic principle applies. The main thing is      to understand the interactions between the flowing water      and the solid objects it confronts. And so (assuming that      your house isn't in danger of washing away after the next      rain), the first rule to consider is look before you touch.    </p>        <p>      Begin by reminding yourself that water flows downhill.      Whatever problems are created upstream from you are passed      on to you in the forms of turbidity, siltation, flooding,      and irregular flow rates. Your job is to mitigate these      effects as the water flows through your land, thus passing      a better stream on to your neighbors downhill.    </p>    <p>      Start off by walking your brook in a downstream direction.      Do it during low, clear water, when details of the      streambed will be most apparent. Then do it again during      high water, when you can best observe the erosive force of      water in action. Do it all kinds of inbetween times. Walk      in the stream when you can, and on the bank when you can't.    </p>    <p>      In your walking or wading, you'll note that erosion isn't a      constant force over the whole stream. Some points are badly      damaged whenever the water rises, while others remain      relatively stable. Your task is to ask why. Why does the      water cut the bank here and not there? Why is the channel      deep at one place and silted in at another? What changes      have occurred, or might occur, in the stream's direction?      What influence exerted on these processes would encourage      stream stability and minimize damage to the land and      waterway?    </p>    <h3>      START WITH THE LAND    </h3>        <p>      All stream erosion problems begin on the land. There are      two main problem categories: excessive erosion of the bank,      and sedimentation of the streambed. (Fig. 1 maps a stretch      of stream containing sites with such problems.)    </p>    <p>      For the purpose of illustration, let's suppose that you      have located one case of each kind of problem. At one      point, your stream is destroying its bank. Pieces of turf      hang out over the water, supported only by a few inches of      soil, which periodically break off. Meanwhile, the      stream-even at low-flow levelsis cutting away at the lower      part of the bank. It has already undercut one mature      cottonwood tree, which hangs precariously half in and half      out of the water, and another tree is threatened.    </p>    <p>      This eroding bank is not only unsightly, but also dangerous      to people or livestock who stray too near the edge.      Furthermore, the stream is steadily eating away your land      and depositing your good soil as harmful silt at downstream      sites.    </p>    <p>      First the stream damages the bank. Then the bank damages      the stream. Farther down from your collapsing bank is one      of the first stops for your lost soil, as well as for other      sediments originating above your property. Just upstream of      a large clump of willows is a shallow, mud-bottomed reach      that is neither attractive nor productive of fish. It used      to be a gravel-bottomed riffle and a deeper pool. You can      tell that by wading through there, because your feet      encounter gravel under a thin layer of silt in the upper      part of the reach. Then, although the water doesn't appear      much deeper, you sink up to your knees in soft sediment.    </p>    <h3>      UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM    </h3>        <p>      There are two ways to attack both of these problems: in the      stream, by redirecting the force of the water, and on the      bank, by stabilizing the soil. Channelization, in its      ultimate form, accomplishes both of these ends, albeit at      the cost of all the stream's natural values. The channel is      dredged perfectly straight, so that the force of the water      against the bank is minimized, and the banks are converted      to rock or even concrete walls, which resist erosive      forces. However, we're looking for a more "natural" way of      accomplishing these same ends.    </p>    <p>      Let's begin with the eroding bank. Why has nature decided      to "pick on" this particular point instead of so many      others? First, note that the problem spot is located on the      outside of a bend, where the force of the current is      strongest. Still, not every bend is as eroded as this one.      Now take a look at the large, barely submerged outcropping      of rock just upstream. A rule of thumb in stream      engineering is that water spills off a solid object at an      angle to the last surface it touches, and that's just what      has happened here. The rock pushes the main force of the      current (the thalweg, in fishery biologist jargon) directy      into the bank, rather than parallel to it.    </p>    <p>      The downed tree is part of the problem, too. Cottonwoods      like to grow along watercourses, and in an undisturbed,      natural environment, that's fine. But in a degraded      environment, cottonwoods may exacerbate bank erosion. These      trees are easily undercut, and even when that doesn't      happen, old, dying cottonwoods may just fall over, pulling      out their own roots.    </p>    <p>      In our example, the gap left by the roots forms a secondary      channel during high water, enabling the stream to cut still      farther into the bank. In addition, the trunk of the tree    </p>    <h3>      Stream Erosion    </h3>    <p>      acts as a partial dam. Some water does spill over the top      of it after a heavy rain or snow-melt butat all times-water      is also forced wider the frunk, further undercutting the      bank. Meanwhile, near the opposite bank, the damming effect      of the top portion of the tree pushes still more water from      the left bank toward the right.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT TO DO    </h3>        <p>      The first and easiest step toward restoring this problem      spot is to get rid of the downed cottonwood. You could, for      example, simply cut it up into logs, then float or carry      them out. Whatever you do, try to avoid going into the      streambed with heavy machinery. (Note: I'm not advocating      removal of all deadwood as a general practice. In many      instances, downed timber contributes substantially to      stream aesthetics and to fish and wildlife habitats. The      point is that this particular tree is clearly contributing      to the erosion problem.)    </p>    <p>      Now let's see if we can redirect the thalweg so it doesn't      collide abruptly with the bank. Removing the rock      outcropping is out of the question; besides, it's      attractive and a good fishing spot. One solution is to set      up a counterforce, and the easiest way to do that is to      place large rocks along the eroding bank-a technique known      as riprap. The obvious purpose of riprap is to help the      shoreline resist the force of the water, but it also      creates turbulence-and turbulence tends to throw the      current back toward the center of the stream, further      reducing bank erosion and deepening the center so that it      can accommodate more water.    </p>    <p>      Placing riprap, however, is not just a matter of flinging      rocks. First of all, the stones must be the correct size      and shape for the dimensions and flow rate of the stream.      If the rocks are too small, they may be moved be a flood.      If they are too large, the bank may erode behind them. As      for shape, flat-edged rocks are easier to place and will      deflect water better than rounded ones. A shovel may be      handy for securely placing the first layer of rock. From      then on, the process is not unlike building a stone wall.      (A layer of gravel under the riprap provides added      protection for the bank.)    </p>    <p>      Riprap can redirect flow, but it doesn't appreciably slow      the water. Furthermore, while well-placed riprap is      scarcely noticeable on some sites, on others it can look as      out of place as a concrete wall.    </p>    <p>      The preferable, but more complicated, alternative is to      build some sort of in-stream structure. The most adaptable      of these is known as a wing deflector. (Fig. 2 shows how a      wing deflector might be sited in the situation we are      discussing, and Fig. 3 shows how it's constructed.) The      space behind the leading edge should always be filled.      Otherwise, floodwaters passing over the top will create a      new erosion site.    </p>    <h3>      SOLVING SILTATION    </h3>        <p>      Now, let's look at the silted downstream site. We've      already helped it a little by dealing with the upstream      problem. At least there will be that much less soil      entering the stream which could be deposited there. But we      want to get rid of most of the present silt layer,      restoring the riffle area (which is the most important type      of feeding and spawning habitat for many kinds of fish),      and deepening the pool.    </p>    <p>      The only real in-stream problem here is caused by the      willows. These trees, with their tenacious root systems,      are great bank stabilizers, but they aren't so desirable      when they get out into the stream. Here two willows, which      face each other on opposite sides of a narrow spot, have      formed a partial dam with their roots and branches, and      that blockage is worsened by floating debris which collects      there. We don't want to eradicate the willows, but we can      prune them periodically and try to control their progeny.    </p>    <p>      To accelerate the process of desiltation, we can make      further use of riprap or wing deflectors to concentrate the      current and flush the silt downstream. In this instance, we      may be able to save labor and cost by substituting large      rocks, strategically placed, for the deflectors. If this is      done, the rocks should be placed toward the middle of the      stream so as not to push the current into the bank. The      ideal is fast current in the middle and slow water along      the banks.    </p>    <h3>      UP ON THE BANK    </h3>    <p>      For the purposes of erosion control, a stream bank above      the waterline can be looked at as a piece of steep      agricultural land. As on "dry" land, the most versatile      tool for erosion control is vegetation. But there are a few      other tactics that may be appropriate (such as the use of      riprap).    </p>    <p>      However, perhaps the most important erosion-control tool on      many stream banks is the barbed-wire fence. Livestock in      general, and cattle in particular, are virtual bankwrecking      machines. They break down vertical banks, loosen soft soil,      make paths that become gulleys, trample and overgraze      protective vegetation, and stir up streambottom sediments.      If at all possible, livestock should be completely fenced      out of streams and off their immediate banks. If no other      provision can be made for watering, or if the animals must      cross the waterway, give them limited access, only at a      gently sloping, erosionresistant site.    </p>    <p>      Human beings need "fencing," too. Try to limit your own      access to a few carefully selected points. And, if      necessary, construct steps to avoid beating a path into a      steep bank.    </p>    <h3>      PROPER VEGETATION    </h3>    <p>      The proper planting of stream banks involves matching the      vegetation to the habitat. As a general rule, the wider the      stream, the taller the vegetation can be. A bank totally      lined with large, mature trees may be quite appropriate on      large rivers, while tiny brooks may do better with nothing      more than a good grass cover. (I'm speaking solely in terms      of flood and erosion control. Choosing a strategy becomes      much more complex when one considers the water temperature      requirements of fish, the potential for loss of water by      evaporation and transpiration, the value of the bank as a      wildlife habitat, the available fishfood supply, the      nutrient contribution made by fallen tree leaves, and the      demands of personal aesthetics. In most cases, some      combination of trees and low-growing vegetation will be      called for.)    </p>    <p>      Even where the use of trees is strongly indicated, the      first step may be to establish a good ground cover. The      procedures for doing so are no different from those      employed in ordinary agriculture. (But do be cautious with      fertilizers; there's no point in trading erosion for      pollution.) Among the many grasses appropriate for      stream-bank planting, my personal favorite is reed canary      grass, which holds soil well, tolerates occasional      flooding, provides food for wildlife, and looks beautiful.      Its only real drawback is that when grown alongside very      small streams, it may extend out into the water. Narrow      waterways may thus be temporarily choked in late summer.    </p>    <p>      Near-vertical banks are among the toughest spots on which      to establish vegetative cover. For this and other      specialized problems, consult your local Soil Conservation      Service office. The experts there may be able to recommend      specific seed mixtures suitable to your site and to local      conditions.    </p>    <p>      In general, there is no tree like the willow for holding a      stream bank together. A wellestablished willow will break      in half before it'll let go. And even a dead willow stump      may provide effective erosion control for many years. Given      these traits and the ease with which they can be planted,      there's no reason not to' plant willows along large      streams. However, on small streams, willows may offset the      good they do on the bank with the damage they do in the      water. Don't plant such trees along little brooks unless      you're prepared to prune the branches periodically.    </p>    <p>      What applies to willows applies, in a lesser degree, to      alders, also commonly found along streams. And, as we have      seen, cottonwoods have their own disadvantages. Ashes,      maples, walnuts, and sycamores are among the trees that      prosper on streamside sites, resist uprooting, and don't      grow into the water. You can work out your own treeplanting      scheme by consulting with tree experts, or by walking or      boating a forested stream in your area and noting the trees      that behave as you would like.    </p>    <p>      In addition to planting trees along the stream, it's also a      good idea to have a line of trees or shrubs directly behind      the high point of the bank. During floods, they'll slow the      receding waters, causing silt to drop out on the bank. This      vegetation will keep silt from the stream, where it's a      problem, and trap it where it'll enrich your agricultural      land.    </p>    <p>      Someone once suggested that naturalstream management-of      which erosion control is a major part-is to waterway      engineering as orthodontics is to oral surgery. And both of      the former work best if you push a little and wait a lot.    </p>    <p>      The satisfaction is not just in pushing for results, though      they come eventually. It's also in waiting, watching, and      encouraging Mother Earth's self-healing processes-and      knowing that you can never learn it all.    </p>
