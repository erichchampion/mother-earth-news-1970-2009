                    <h5 id="byline">      by David Peterson    </h5>    <p>      I was slipping quietly through the white heart of a      parklike grove of quaking aspen when a roundish bundle of      chocolate fur emerged from a thicket of Gambel oak a few      yards to my left and came waddling my way. The creature      appeared to be neither canine, feline, nor bovine, and      though it was about the size of a large badger, the shape      and coloration were wrong.    </p>        <p>      What it was, I soon saw, was a bear cub, its chubby body      swaying from side to side like a ship in heavy seas as it      bobbed along atop stubby, bowed legs.<br />      <br />      Then, just a few seconds in the wake of the first, a second      cub burst from the brush . . . and a third. And all three      of the little rascals were headed right for me, with the      intrepid leader now just a few feet away.<br />      <br />      I was thrilled-though somewhat distracted by a most      pressing curiosity: Where is Momma bear, and how big is      she?<br />      <br />      The matron didn't keep me waiting long, making her entrance      a few moments later from behind a curtain of aspen saplings      a score or so yards uphill and, fortunately, upwind.      Hump-shouldered and autumn fat, the mother bear was      by far the most beautiful specimen of Ursus americanus I'd      ever seen, more closely resembling a small grizzly than      your typical, postcard-variety black bear. Most      significantly, she wasn't black. Her head, legs, and ample      rump were patched with the same chocolate brown that      completely clothed the cubs, but her back was a broad swath      of straw blond that took on a mottled appearance as she      moved through the scattered shafts of golden sunlight      fingering down through the aspens.<br />      <br />      As the sow browsed slowly toward where I stood like a      grinning pillar amidst her trio of hyperactive ursine      infants, it occurred to me that my situation-sandwiched      between an approaching mother bear and her cubswas      something less than enviable. Perhaps, I reckoned, this      would be as good a time as any to mentally course through      what I knew of black bear biology and behavior.    </p>        <p>      This female's brown-and-blond coloration, while giving the      lie to the name black bear, really wasn't all that unusual      for a Rocky Mountain bruin. In the hardwood forests of      eastern North America, almost all black bears are, in fact,      black (often with a blaze of white on chest or throat). But      in the Rocky Mountain West, a pure licorice black bear is      the exception rather than the rule, with chocolate,      cinnamon, and vanilla being the more common flavors. (And      somewhere up in the primeval forests of coastal British      Columbia roams the ghostlike Kermode's bear, a snow white,      blue-eyed black bear variation.)<br />      <br />      Another regional difference in this interesting race of      bruins is that eastern black bears tend to be larger than      their western cousins. While Rocky Mountain males rarely      exceed 100 pounds, 600-pound boars occasionally turn up in      some northeastern states. (The largest black bear on      record, killed in Wisconsin in the late 1800s, crushed the      scales at just over 800 pounds-a respectable weight      even for a mature male grizzly.) Female black bears average      a petite 150 to 230 pounds in the Rockies, while ranging up      to as much as 350 pounds in some eastern states. The      Colorado female squinting my way at the moment looked to be      toward the top end of the western weight scale, obviously      far exceeding my comparatively puny 160 pounds.<br />      <br />      But coloration and weight aside, the most pertinent      biological question to ponder, given my circumstances,      seemed to be . . . what do black bears eat?<br />      <br />      Wildlife biologists say that Ursus american us is      omnivorous-meaning the species consumes both meat and      greens. But "opportunist" might better describe the      creature's culinary habits, since a hungry black bear will      eat damn near anything. (Including, in rare but documented      instances, people.)<br />      <br />      In the vegetable department, black bears are partial to      berries, forbs, grasses, mast, sedges, herbaceous plants,      and the cambium of softbarked trees. In matters of the      flesh, they dig gophers, marmots, ground squirrels, voles,      Mice, and grubs, and-when they're very hungry and very      luckyoccasionally take deer and small livestock such as      pigs, goats, and sheep. Additionally, the rotting carcasses      of winter-killed animalscarrion-can play an important      nutritional role during early spring when bears are just      emerging, quite literally starved, from their winter dens      and the spring green-up isn't yet in full swing. Wild      honey, of course, is the dessert of choice, with discarded      human foodgarbage-running a close second.<br />      <br />      Surely, I figured, with such a wide variety of chow to      choose from, no self-respecting ursine mother-of-three      would be interested in gnawing on a leathery old critter      like me.<br />      <br />      Chomp chomp said Momma bear just then, popping her      steel-trap jaws as if to say she knew I was there and      sensed my uneasinessas if to let me know that she could      hear the bassdrum pounding of my heart and it ticked her      off.<br />      <br />      I tried to convince myself there was little to worry about,      for black bears almost never pose a serious threat to      humans . . . so long as the bruins are treated with the      respect due unto large, fast, well-armed, heavily muscled,      unpredictable, predatory beasts. In fact, wild      bears-nonpark animals-are among the most reclusive of all      large mammals, want only to be left alone, and generally      will hightail it out of the neighborhood at the first hint      of human presence.<br />      <br />      And yet, I could hardly deny the fact that there have been      several dozen people mauled by black bears in North America      since the turn of the century-with a score of those      maulings resulting in the death of the victims. And some of      those attacks were determined (by the most grisly evidence      imaginable) to have been predaceous.<br />      <br />      A chill breeze and the treetop rattle of sere leaves      reminded me that another summer was history. Perhaps, I      reflected, that accounted for why these bears were out and      about instead of napping on this fine autumn afternoon:      They were embarked on a last-minute fattening spree in      anticipation of the approaching denning season. Visualizing      the cold and snow that freeze-frames this high country in      winter, I wondered where my four bears would hole up during      the coming cold months.<br />      <br />      In the southeastern U.S., black bears often den high above      ground in the rot-hollowed trunks of large, standing      hardwood snags. Out here in the Rockies, the bruins are      more likely to keep to the ground, seeking out natural      caves and the bowl-shaped depressions created when trees      fall and are uprooted. Throughout their North American      range, however, the well-insulated creatures will sometimes      simply plop down on a hospitable-looking patch of ground      and wait for Mother Nature to cover them with a blanket of      snow. Rarely will black bears actually excavate dens; such      an exhausting expenditure of energy would consume too many      of the fat-stored calories needed to see them through their      long winter's slumber.<br />      <br />      Judging from their cherubic appearance, the three playful      cubs whose excitingly and exceedingly proximate company I      was still enjoying had been born in the previous winter's      den. Like all black bear progeny, they would have begun      life at little more than eight nearnaked ounces each, and      would be allowed to enjoy just one more winter's nap      snuggled hard against their mother's warmth before being      abandoned to earn their own livings in the world.<br />      <br />      With this litter of cubs grown and gone, Momma bear would      be free once again to accept the affections of a      concupiscent male (or several, bears being joyously      promiscuous creatures) during the ursine courting months of      June and July. Then, the January or February following a      successful mating, the sow would give birth to another      biennial litter of from one to four cubs. (But only if she      had enjoyed a bountiful autumn that allowed her to put on      sufficient fat to insure the production of enough milk for      the babes' survival; otherwise, her pregnancy would      selfterminate.)    </p>        <p>      One of the first lessons Momma bear would teach a fresh      litter of cubs after quitting the nursery den in April or      May is the high art of arboreal acrobatics: tree climbing.      Very young cubs are defenseless when away from their      mothers, and-as evidenced by the trio that was frolicking      carelessly at my heelsare filled with youthful temerity.      Consequently, infant bears might easily fall prey to      predators were it not for their ability to climb.<br />      <br />      Perhaps, I reasoned, I should consider a similar line of      defense.<br />      <br />      Moving only eyeballs, I surreptitiously shifted my gaze      from the feeding sow to the trees nearest me, sizing them      up for climbability . . . and was distressed to notice the      obvious: None had limbs (those enticing projections that      desperate folk are wont to go out on) low enough to grasp.      Further, fully a quarter of the aspens wore on their      smooth, powder white skins the rough, dark scars of wounds      inflicted by the short, heavy claws of climbing      bears.<br />      <br />      No surprise there, and no help either. I knew full well      that U. americanus was a better tree climber than your      average H. sap. Still, I counseled myself, if Momma bearwho      was now a mere dozen or so yards off my port bowshould      discover me quaking like an aspen in the midst of her cubs      and take umbrage, wouldn't I be better off treed like a      coon than standing frozen in my tracks like a lamb at the      slaughterhouse gate? Also, I reasoned, the toothsome blonde      just might accept my flight up a tree as a sign that I      meant her cubs no harm.<br />      <br />      A violent self-defense was out of the question. For one      thing, I like bears, whether they care for my company or      not. (There are far too many humans in this world these      days, not nearly enough bears, and damned if I'm going to      add to the problem.) But on a more pragmatic level, the big      hunting knife I religiously lug along on my solo treks into      the backcountry as a talisman against various imagined      emergencies was out of immediate reach, buried deep in the      bowels of the daypack appended to my tensed shoulders. Just      as well, too, since I didn't feel much like playing the      role of a modern-day Hugh Glassthe 1820s mountain man who      used a knife to defend himself against an enraged mother      bear in hand-to-claw combat, then spent the next several      months gimping around the boonies with a body like Swiss      cheese.<br />      <br />      And close or no, the sow was still upwind and      feeding-suggesting that she hadn't yet gotten my scent or      seen through my impromptu disguise as a tall, skinny bush.      (Bears are rather dim-sighted creatures that have a hard      time picking out a stationary object from its background,      but their hearing is good and their sense of smell is      superb.) Considering the hand I'd been dealt by capricious      fate, it seemed that my best bet to avoid being      transmogrified into bear poop was to stand pat until I was      dead certain the bruin had spotted me, viewed me as a      threat, and was preparing to play her claw-spiked trump      card . . . at which time I'd probably do in my camp      trousers what bears are notorious for doing in the woods,      then wing it gracelessly into the iffy protection of the      nearest tree.<br />      <br />      While the three wee bears continued to chortle and romp at      my feet and their mother fed steadily nearer, I strained to      remain motionless.<br />      <br />      Then, abruptly-had she wised up to my I'm-a-bush      act?-the sow jerked to attention, tested the air with      flared nostrils, and catapulted herself forward.    </p>        <p>      I was temporarily stunned by the impact of a heart-stopping      adrenaline rush followed by a prolonged moment of      breath-holding catatonia as the bear loomed large and so      near I could have tickled her with the proverbial ten-foot      pole. But I didn't tickle (I didn't have a pole), and the      sow didn't tackle. In fact, she charged right on past      without giving me even so much as a sidelong glance, much      less a hard time.<br />      <br />      When, a ways down the hill, Momma bear hauled up to call in      her errant brood with a couplet of low grunts pregnant with      the urgency of distress, I guessed that she'd caught a      faint, upwind drift of man smell as she was feeding toward      me-but, unsure of its source, quickly opted for      flight over fight.<br />      <br />      I watched with mixed relief and sadness as the sow led her      reunited family at a brisk pace down the mountainside and      out of my life. A few moments more and my bears were gone,      their shadowy forms swallowed up by the darkening forest.    </p>    <h3>      The Bear Facts<br />      By Lance Olsen    </h3>    <p>      Unlike the grizzly, the black bear probably won't become a      threatened or endangered species in the lower 48 states      within the next few years. Nonetheless, Ursus americanus as      already extinct on a local basis in many states and is      lasted as threatened or endangered an others-and more      of these spot extanetians can be expected as an      ever-increasing human population makes expanding      demands on our country's shrinking wilderness and its      wildlife.<br />      <br />      But stall, when compared to the seriously threatened status      of grizzlies in the lower 48, black bears have several      survival advantages over their bigger cousins.<br />      <br />      For one thank they enjoy amore rapid rate of reproduction.      This as due an part to the differing lengths of time      grizzly and black bear mothers keep their cubs before      casting them off. While grizzly mothers stay with their      young for 30 months or more, black bear matrons typically      boot their cubs out after only 16 months. And since mother      bears wash young an tow don't breed, a black bear female      wall produce more cubs in her lifetime than wall a      grizzly.<br />      <br />      Another factor working an their favor as that black bears      are more tolerant of humans than grizzlies are, and thus      can hang on an areas that are too densely settled to make      survival realistic for the bigger bruins with their greater      needs and visibility. Nevertheless, black bears are often      killed when civilization invades the wilds and the      bears-finding ranch, farm, homestead, or subdivision      where their favorite berry patch used to be-are      forced by hunger to prey on the livestock or pets brought      by humans onto bear country. Some sheep herders are among      the worst offenders here, often shooting bears on sight.      (One sheepman reportedly killed seven black bears in a      single summer.)<br />      <br />      In his book Bear Attacks, researcher Steve Herrero reports      that he has been able to verify 20 cases in which people      were killed by black bears in North America from 1900      through 1980. That's about half the number killed by      grizzlies during the same period. Consequentlysince black      bears aren't perceived as being as dangerous as      grizzlies-there has been less pressure to eliminate      them in the name of human safety.<br />      <br />      The major force working against black bears is dwindling      forest habitat. Ursus americanus evolved as a      forest-dependent species, and rarely ventures auto      open country. Heavily timbered areas provide black bears      with food and protection from inclement weather, hide them      when necessary, and give them trees to climb in order to      escape immediate danger.<br />      <br />      But prime forest habitat is rapidly being destroyed for      human use via deforestation for subdivisions and      urban-suburban sprawl, as well as by the unrelenting      advance of the agriculture, mining, livestock, and timber      industries. And the water and air pollution that follow      these scratchangs of civilization compound the problem even      more.<br />      <br />      In short, the continued survival of bears an the      wild-both blacks and grizzlies-will depend on      how humanity treats not just the animals themselves, but      planet Earth as well.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Lance Olsen is president of the Great      Bear Foundation (GBF), a nonprofit organization dedicated      to insuring the survival and welfare of wild bears.
