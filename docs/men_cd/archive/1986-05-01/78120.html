            			<p>Nickel-cadmium batteries can be      an economical (and environmentally beneficial) alternative      to conventional cells . . . if you get their full life.</p>      			<h5 id="byline">by TJ Byers</h5>			<p>In ten short years, rechargeable      nickelcadmium batteries have become commonplace modern      conveniences. They now power everything from razors to      radios, and when one goes dead you simply plug it in for a      recharging. (See issue 95, page 50 for instructions on      building a charger.) A time comes, however, when the      battery simply won't hold a charge any longer      andpresumably-must be replaced.</p><p> Unfortunately, many nicads      get deep-sixed before their time. In most cases, more than      one cell is needed to power a device, and one bad cell can      drag the rest of a perfectly good battery down. Most often,      the problem is an internal short, which bypasses current      around the affected cell. The other cells are actually      fine, but there's not enough capacity for the job, so the      battery gets thrown away.</p><p> Fortunately, on the other hand,      an ailing cell can often be shocked back to life if you      force enough current through it to cause the short to burn      away. Once that electroshock therapy is finished, the      battery can be recharged for normal operation.      </p>			<h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3>    	<p>To assemble a low-cost "nicad nudger," start by    drilling holes in the plastic case and mounting the switch    and the neon lamp, as indicated on the parts layout. (Use    rubber cement to secure the lamp.) Then solder the components    together, being careful to observe the polarity of the    capacitors and the diode. Tie knots in the AC line cord and    the clip leads inside the case, so that the wires won't pull    on the components inside. This is particularly important with    the line cord: If the uninsulated leads were to come out of    the side of the case, you could get a lifethreatening shock!    For safety's sake, please follow the directions carefully,    and use only a plastic case.</p>		<h3>THE HEALING HAND</h3>		<p>		The nicad resuscitator can be used to resurrect    batteries up to 22 volts in capacity. With the line cord    unplugged, connect the red and black clip leads,    respectively, to the positive and negative terminals of the    faulty battery. (You may need to use a specific type of    connector, such as a battery holder, to attach some    batteries.)</p><p> Insert the plug into an outlet and wait until the    READY lamp lights. This should take about 90 seconds. Now    press the RESTORE button. The READY light should go out. If    not, check your battery connections.</p><p> It may take several    cycles to completely "cure" the battery, so continue the    procedure until the battery accepts a full charge under    normal charging conditions. Be sure to allow sufficient time    for the READY light to come back on before you push the    RESTORE button again. When you're done, always unplug the AC    cord before disconnecting the battery leads, and always leave    the cord unplugged when the unit is not in use.</p><p> Not all    nicads can be restored by this method-even under optimum    conditions, there are limits to their lifespans-but most can.    In a few cases, the battery's capacity will only be partially    restored. But even then, some is better than none. And you    may find that many batteries will return for another half (or    more) of a lifetime.</p>
