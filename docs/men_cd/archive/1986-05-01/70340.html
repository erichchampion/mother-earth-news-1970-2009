            <p>      <em>If you can't take the heat, get yourself out of the      kitchen and . . .</em>    </p>		    <h5 id="byline">     by W. Brandon Randolph    </h5>        <p>      Summertime and indoor canning go together like-well, on      especially hot days, kind of like fire and brimstone. But      look: What's that odd-looking device you see in the photos?      It's cooled by nature itself . . . and able to process up      to 45 quarts at a time while its owners sit sipping iced      tea in the shade! It's inexpensive! It's easy to build!      It's Super Canner!    </p>    <h3>      A SUPER ALTERNATIVE    </h3>    <p>      To make your own outdoor canning cooker, gather together      the materials listed here. Be sure that the 55-gallon drum      is clean and free of chemicals, and that it has a bung hole      with a screw-type cover at each end (most drums have a      large opening at one end and a smaller one at the other).    </p>    <p>      Now cut the drum and other components as specified. You can      use a hacksaw to section the lengths of water pipe and      angle iron, but if you don't have a torch or arc welder to      cut the drum and metal grating yourself (and to weld the      leg-support components together), you'd best find a friend      or a metal shop to do the job for you. In any case,      remember to retain a little more than half of the drum,      enough so-when the canner is filled-the water      level will cover the tops of quart canning jars by an inch      or two. Also, be sure that the large bung hole, which      you'll use to drain the canner, will rest at its lowest      point when the canner is mounted on its legs.    </p>        <p>      Next, make the leg supports by welding each of the 5"      pieces of water pipe at an angle of about 45Â° to a 3"      piece of angle iron (see Photo 1). Then drill two holes in      each of the supports, and bore a matching pair of mounting      holes at each of the canner's four outside corner edges.      (The exact location of the holes at each edge isn't      particularly critical, as long as all four pairs are      positioned consistently.)    </p>    <p>      With that done, you'll be ready to attach the supports to      the drum, using the quarterinch bolts. Don't forget to put      a flat washer under each bolt head on the inside of the      drum and a spring-lock washer under each nut on the      outside. And before you tighten the nuts and bolts, be sure      to caulk the joints on both sides thoroughly with silicone      sealant (I use GE Silicone Clear Household Glue and Seal),      to prevent leaks. Spread the goo under the flat washers and      between the leg supports and the barrel's sides.    </p>    <p>      Once the brackets are caulked and fastened in place, dress      up your Super Canner a bit with a good coat of      high-temperature black paint. Then go ahead and slip the      EMT legs into their supports. Now slide a radiator-hose      clamp around each leg, and open each clamp enough to allow      you to thread the link chain through all four clamps. Screw      one clamp in position about halfway up the leg (or a little      less; see Photo 2) . . . pull the chain tight to the next      clamp . . . fasten that clamp in place . . . and continue      around the canner until you're back where you started.      Loosen that clamp, make sure both ends of the chain are      threaded through it and pulled tight, and screw the clamp      down again.    </p>        <p>      Now put the metal grating in place inside the canner-it      should rest nicely a few inches above the bottom. And      finally, though it's optional, you'll probably want to make      a cover for your Super Canner, to help hold the heat in.      Nearly any appropriately large, flat piece of metal will      do. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Avoid using aluminum or galvanized      metal.] I made our lid from a scrap piece of corrugated      roofing and attached a wooden handle fashioned from a 2 X      4. I strongly recommend a handle, since the canner's cover      can get hotter than a fast-food grill. In any event, you'll      want to be sure to keep a pair of pot holders handy      whenever you fire up your cooker.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of firing up, all you need is some kindling      and-once the blaze is established-a few      good-size logs. (If you heat with wood, chances are you've      already accumulated a pile of hard-to-split, knotty pieces      that are too large for your stove; well, now they can be      put to good use under your Super Canner!)    </p>    <p>      Each time you're finished using the cooker, be sure to let      the water cool before removing the bung-hole plug to drain      out the liquid. On the other hand, don't keep the water in      the canner for an extended period, or the bottom may rust      out. If you must drain the canner when the water is still      hot, use longhandled pliers to loosen the cap, and unscrew      it slowly, or the water could gush out and burn you.    </p>    <p>      When the canning season is over, touch up any exterior      rusty spots with spray paint, give the inside and the      grating a light coating of WD-40 lubricant, and remove the      legs and chain and stash them in the barrel. Your canner      will be prepped for storage, ready and waiting to make cool      work of putting up next season's garden produce!    </p>    <h3>      List of Materials    </h3>    <p>      (1) 55-gallon drum, cut as shown in Photo 3<br />      (1) 18" X 31-1/2" piece expanded metal grating<br />      (4) 3/4" X 30" electrical conduit (EMT) (4) 1" X 5" water      pipe<br />      (4) 1-1/4" X 3" angle iron<br />      (8) 1/4" X 1/2" bolts<br />      (8) 1/4" nuts<br />      (8) 1/4" lock washers<br />      (8) 1/4" flat washers<br />      (1) tube silicone sealant<br />      (2) cans black spray paint<br />      (4) radiator-hose clamps to fit 3/4" EMT<br />      (1) 12-1/2' length of small link chain    </p>
