                    <p>      And should you wander out back to investigate the source of      that sound, chances are-if you expressed even the      slightest bit of interest-I'd put a throwing knife in      your hand, give you a few instructions (essentially the      same tips I'll be offering in this article), and have you      sticking the blade consistently within about five minutes!    </p>        <p>      Of course, I doubt that many of you will ever pass my home,      but I am pretty certain that if you take the time to try      knife throwing, you'll become as involved in the pastime as      I have. In fact, many of my neighbors who once thought my      hobby a bit strange are now enthusiastic throwers      themselves. (Even the pastor from up the road recently      asked me to help him set up a throwing target in his      backyard!)    </p>    <h3>      READY . . .    </h3>        <p>      First of all, you should know that your whittling or      hunting knife isn't suited to this activity. (Almost any      knife can be thrown effectively, but those not designed for      the sport will lack accuracy, will carry the risk of cut      fingers, and will more than likely not survive too many      throws.) True throwing knives usually have dull edges,      allowing a safe and smooth release. Most such implements      are also designed to be thrown by either the handle or the      blade and are heavy enough to allow easy throwing from      relatively long distances. A quality thrower, such as one      of those manufactured by the Tru-Balance Knife Co., will be      about a foot in length and weigh approximately one pound.      (See the address at the end of the article.)    </p>    <h3>      SET...    </h3>    <p>      Among the easiest types of throwing targets to build is one      consisting primarily of replaceable soft pine boards nailed      to a 3/4" plywood backing sheet. (This is one of the few      projects to appear in MOTHER's pages that's designed to be      destroyed!) To build one, first drive a pair of 2 X 4s into      the ground about four feet apart. You'll want about four      feet of the boards to remain exposed, and to sink them      deeply enough to withstand the hammering that hard-thrown      knives can dish out. With that done, nail the 3/4" plywood      to the uprights. Then align enough vertical pieces of 1"      (or thicker) pine to cover the ply, nailing these in place      as you go. You'll have to replace the softwood as it      becomes chewed up, so use scraps if you have them      available.    </p>    <h3>      THROW!    </h3>    <p>      Now, holding your knife by the handle, pace of four or five      normal steps from the target, and turn to face it. Taking      one long step toward the target as you do so (righthanders      will move their left foot, southpaws the opposite), throw      the knife at the target with a simple overhand pitch,      making sure that the blade is released smoothly with no      imparted spin, and that it's not twisted to either side as      it's released.    </p>    <p>      If, on your first few throws, the knife strikes edge first,      with the point up, move back a foot or so and try again. If      it hits with the tip down, move forward a bit. Eventually      you'll discover the natural one-turn range for the knife.      Mark that spot, and go on to try to find the range for a      spin-and-a-half blade-held throw (four feet or so farther      back) and then for a double spin handle-held throw (about      three or four paces back from the single-spin range). Knife      throwing requires practice-like archery, it's a sport that      requires a lot of seemingly simple actions to mesh      correctly-but within a very short time you'll be      getting consistent hits from the one-spin mark, and      you can then go on to improve your accuracy (paper plates      tacked to the target are good for this).    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind, as you practice, that knives can bounce back      from the target, so position any spectators well behind you      (and watch out for yourself, too). Also, never throw at a      target without first making sure that the area behind it is      free of dozing cats and the like. Once you get the knack of      it, I'm sure that you will, as I have, come to take great      relaxation and pleasure from the meditative practice of      "whoomping" a heavy piece of steel, with style and      accuracy, into an upright plank of pine.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For information on TruBal throwing knives,      write the Tru-Balance Knife Co., 2155 Tremont Blvd. N. W.,      Grand Rapids, MI 49504.    </p>    <hr />    <h3>      MOTHER'S BACK-TO-BASICS BLADES    </h3>        <p>      The throwing knives shown here were all cut, using a      hacksaw, from 3/16" maid steel flat stock. They were then      sharpened, only near the points, with a bastard file.      Surprisingly enough, we found that these simple creations      performed nearly as well as comparably sized commercial      throwers, and felt that the freedom to experiment with      designs (as represented by the double pointed "beginner's      knife") allowed us to study front-rear balance and other      factors. (In general, we found that knives balanced at the      center point perform best for either-end throwing,      while those that are heavier toward the point or hilt throw      best when the lighter end is grasped.) Though we didn't      temper the knives, they could be hardened by simply heating      them to a cherry red in a woodstove or barbecue and then      quenching the metal in water. If you'd like to take a very      low-cost approach to knife throwing until you decade how      great your interest will be, use the designs we've provided      (1 sq = 1"), find a scrap of mild steel stock, and gave      this simple project a try!    </p>
