    <p>
                    <p>      I can't speak for gardeners across the entire country, of      course, but I personally have never experienced a more      fruitful growing season-thanks primarily to      near-perfect weather-than that of 1985. Consequently,      the new seed varieties I tested last year were provided      with everything they needed to do their thing and show      their stuff (or lack thereof) . . . and I've chosen the      best of the batch to recommend to you for 1986.</p><p> I'll begin      at the beginning by telling you about the vegetable      varieties that can be sown the earliest (right now in most      parts of the U.S.), then proceed according to the usual      order of planting. Please keep in mind that, even though I      have space to mention the outstanding qualities of only a      few, all of the vegetable varieties in the following      listing are there because they're exceptional in growth      rate, hardiness, flavor, and even aesthetics.    </p>    <h3>      Lettuce    </h3>        <p>      This year we have some dandy lettuce varieties to choose      from. Leading the list is a leaf type called Red Fire,      offered by Vermont Bean Seed Company (VBS). Red Fire is      resistant to both heat and cold, and the crisp and tender      leaves will add vibrant color to your summer salads. VBS is      also your source for one of the better new "crisphead" (or      iceberg) types, dubbed Ballade. Ballade matures early (80      days) and is medium-sized, with a firm, bright green head.      It can be planted closely and bears up under heat      admirably. Thompson & Morgan (T&M) has an even      earlier maturing crisphead (75 days) called El Toro. "The      Bull" lives up to its name by withstanding extremes of cold      and wet in early spring, but nonetheless it has a tender      heart.</p>      <p>      Summer Baby Bibb, one of the better new Bibb lettuces,      hails from Shepherd's Seeds. Summer Baby is sweet and      possibly the tastiest of the Bibbs that are able to      withstand hot weather. Shepherd's also offers one of the      finest new romaines, called Rouge d'Hiver. With its broad      red leaves, this one really stands out in the garden-and      produces massive, solid, deep-hearted heads. My final      recommendation, also from Shepherd's, is a Batavian type      called Bogota. Batavian lettuces have yet to really catch      on in America, but if you'll give Bogota a try, I think      you'll see why Europeans are so enamored of these crisp      green beauties.    </p>    <h3>      Radishes    </h3>    <p>      One of the most flamboyant-in fact, that's its      name-of the new radishes is a European variety offered by      Shepherd's. A half-long type, Flamboyant is a beautiful      glossy white and vermilion with juicy, crisp, and only      mildly pungent flesh.</p>      <p>      Midwest Seed Company gets in on the radish act with its      wonderful Fuego. Bright red and delicious, this newly      developed variety matures in about 25 days. One of Fuego's      strongest suits is its resistance to fusarium, a chief      disease of radishes. And for a tasty red radish that's      resistant not only to fusarium but to black root and root      scurf as well, try Fancy Red, from Harris Seeds.</p>      <p>      If your taste in radishes runs to the pure white varieties,      I recommend Snowbelle from Twilley Seed Company. Snowbelle      is about as close to white-radish perfection as you're      likely to find, maturing in 30 days to a big, round bulb of      tangy delight.    </p>    <h3>      Turnips    </h3>    <p>      Gilfeather-available from both VBS and      T&M-is the best of the new turnip varieties (new,      that is, to North America; its unique, sweet flavor has      been treasured for nearly a century now by European      gardeners). And as a bonus for greens lovers, Gilfeather      tops are almost identical in appearance and taste to      kale.</p>      <p>      Another fine European turnip, this one offered by      Shepherd's, is DeNancy, which matures in just 45 days      (about three weeks earlier than Gilfeather) and produces a      crisp, purple-and-white root with a mild flavor. Similar to      DeNancy is Tokyo Top, from Kilgore Seed Company. This      hybrid has tasty green tips and delicious, pure white roots      that average 2" to 3" in length.    </p>    <h3>      Spinach    </h3>    <p>      Skookum, from Twilley, leads the spinach list this year.      Maturing in 41 days, Skookum may be the best-tasting, most      diseaseresistant semisavoy spinach ever offered. However,      Majore Hybrid-from Porter & Son,      Seedsmen-is also a fine new variety that's slow to      bolt and tasty both fresh and processed. And to make it a      trio, consider Meyer Seed Company's Savoy Supreme.      Developed at the University of Wisconsin, this nonhybrid is      as delightful to look at as it is to eat.    </p>    <h3>      Greens    </h3>    <p>      Of the many fine new varieties of greens to emerge from my      1985 trials, one of the best is Tendergreen II mustard from      Porter. This hybrid improvement over the original      Tendergreen is tastier and even more productive than its      predecessor.</p>      <p>      Kale seems to be gaining in popularity, and the best recent      introduction I've found-combining high productivity with      great flavor-is Winterbor from Johnny's</p><p> Selected      Seeds. Winterbor does well planted early and will continue      to thrive until snow flies in late fall. Other good kales      are Cottagers from T&M and Verdura from Shepherd's      (Verdura matures about 10 days sooner than the other two).    </p>    <h3>      Onions    </h3>        <p>      One of the many good new onion varieties is Sweet Sandwich      from Liberty Seed Company. This Sweet Spanish-type      onion is also a good keeper and slices like a dream.      Another dandy burger topper is Sweet Winter, from Geo. W.      Park Seed Company. If planted in the fall and wintered      over, Sweet Winter will take off on its own in early      spring, providing large, tasty onions long before the main      crop is ready to harvest.</p>      <p>      Of the many new, main-crop, long-storage onions around this      year, I recommend Copra from Johnny's, Tarmagon from Stokes      Seeds, and Autumn Glo from Farmer's Seed &      Nursery-all of which are easily started from      seed.</p>      <p>      Yet another new onion, worth growing as a novelty, is No      Tears from T&M; the name is self-explanatory.</p>      <p>      And finally, a new twist on an old favorite: The Vidalia      onion-world famous for its remarkable      flavor-can now be grown from the seed available from      Henry Field & Company. I'm not saying it's easy to grow      Vidalias from this new seed-just that it can be done      . . . and it's certainly worth the trouble!    </p>    <h3>      Peas    </h3>    <p>      The best of the few new pea varieties for 1986 is a snow      pea from Field, appropriately called Snowflake. Not only      were my Snowflakes' short, stout vines loaded with large,      tender peas, but if I kept them picked, the plants kept      producing over an extended period. Another new pea worth      noting is Sweet Snap from VBS. This one produces peas that      are sweet, tender, and never stringyand the plant is more      compact and disease-resistant than the popular Sugar Snap      variety.    </p>    <h3>      Cole Crops    </h3>        <p>      When you think of cabbage, think of Treta from Park. This      cone-headed beauty is crisp, sweet, and far superior to my      previous favorite, Jersey Wakefield. Park is also the      source for Heavy Weighter Hybrid, a large, heat- and      frost-resistant main-season type. Grenadier, from      Shepherd's, is another good main-season cabbage. (This      Dutch introduction isn't as big as the Heavy Weighter      Hybrid, but it makes up for that by being highly      crack-resistant, enabling it to be left in the garden much      longer.) Other new varieties worthy of a look include Blue      Ribbon from Twilley, Tucana from Stokes, and Superior      Danish from Johnny's.</p>      <p>      Red cabbage has made a comeback recently and is quite      popular in salads. Two of the best varieties are Red Ribbon      from Twilley and Super Red from Liberty.</p>      <p>      There are also two promising new savoy cabbages this      season. Spivoy, from T&M, is a minisavoy that does well      in poor soil, even with close planting and under drought      conditions, and it's highly resistant to bursting. A      similar variety is the Early Curly Hybrid Savoy from Burpee      Seed Company. Early Curly is larger than Spivoy and equally      delicious. Another good new savoy is Salarite, offered by      Stokes.</p>      <p>      Of the kohlrabis, I prefer Waldemar White from Shepherd's.      This variety, when eaten raw, actually has an applelike      flavor! A good purple kohlrabi is the slow-bolting      Purple Delicacy from VBS-ten days slower to mature      than most other varieties, but worth the wait.</p>      <p>      Green Dwarf No. 36 broccoli is a superb, space-saving      miniature from Park. This 8" plant bears 5-1/2" heads with      exceptional flavor, can be planted closely, and is      resistant to that bane of broccolis, downy mildew. Another      fine introduction is Dandy Early from T&M-it can      be grown both spring and fall, and it freezes well. An      excellent standard-type broccoli is Packman, from Johnny's.      This strong, compact, early producer yields large, tasty      heads.</p>      <p>      Twilley's Earli-Light cauliflower has all the good points      of my previous favorite, J White Contessa (also from      Twilley), but has larger heads that mature earlier. For an      exceptionally tender, delicate-flavored cauliflower, try      Raket from Shepherd's. And finally, Newton Seale from      T&M and Early Selfe-Blanche from Liberty are both      also superb-and prolific-cauliflowers.</p>      <p>      Brussels sprouts have gained popularity recently due to      their purported health benefits. Shepherd's is helping to      fill the demand with Valiant, a fine European variety that      produces delicate, rich-flavored, buttonlike sprouts. The      other new Brussels sprout worth noting is the Ormavon      Hybrid from T&M-unique in that a large cabbage      grows at the top of the sprout-producing stalk, with both      sprouts and cabbage being delicious and long-lasting.    </p>    <h3>      Beets    </h3>    <p>      Leading the beet parade is Royal Detroit from Twilley. Not      only does this fine new hybrid have a super taste, but it's      nearly free of zoning (uniform in color), making it superb      for processing. Both Henry Field and Meyer offer Red Ace,      another superior beet hybrid that's early-maturing and free      of zoning.    </p>    <h3>      Carrots    </h3>        <p>      Burpee, long a leading producer of fine carrot varieties,      leads the pack with Toudo, probably the most perfect      Nantes-type carrot you'll ever see. Tondo can be harvested      any time from infancy to maturity (70 days), reaching a      length of 7-1/2". A similar variety is Lindoro, from Park.      And if you want to turn your carrots into juice, you'll be      hard-pressed to find better than Mokum, from T&M.      Finally, gardeners who are looking for slim carrot sticks      should go with Pak Mor from Farmer's-it's similar to      the Danvers type, but a better keeper, with a coreless,      bright orange center.    </p>    <h3>      Potatoes    </h3>    <p>      The only new spud varieties worth noting are both red. From      Park we have Sangre, a delicious, long-term keeper . . .      while both Field and Gurney Seed & Nursery offer Rosa,      a delicious, blight-resistant potato.    </p>    <h3>      Corn    </h3>        <p>      There are enough excellent new corn varieties available      this season to fill a book.</p>      <p>      If early white corn is your favorite, try Stardust, from      Park. Of the midseason whites, consider White Magic from      Harris (73 days), Chalice from either Twilley or      Wyatt-Quarles Seed Company (78 days), and Bunton 74      from Bunton Seed Company-a producer of delicious      8-1/2" ears.</p>      <p>      The most attractive of the yellow midseason varieties is      Twilley's Debutante, yielding 7-1/2" cobs in 73 days.      Crusader, by Stokes, is one of the strongest growers I know      of . . . and Butterfruit, from Park, will give you plenty      of tasty 8" ears from a little 5' plant.</p>      <p>      Moving along to the big fellas, we have Summer Delicious      from Liberty, it's a late maturer (96 days), but its huge      9-1/2" ears are worth the wait-they're good as good can be.      Twilley's Great-Taste offers elevated sugars and a      wonderfully milky texture. A similar variety is Miracle,      from Burpee.</p>      <p>      The best new main-season bicolor corn is the G-90 Hybrid      from Porter. Each G-90 plant produces two ears of bicolored      corn that are equal or superior in flavor to nearly any      yellow or white variety, and both freeze and can      well.</p>      <p>      Of the main-season whites, I like Silver Pac from Liberty,      which takes 86 days to produce an abundance of sweet 8"      ears . . . and Robson's Seneca Paleface, another fine      86-day white corn, available from Twilley and other      suppliers.</p>      <p>      My favorite source for summer sweet corn is Twilley.      There's Summer Sweet 7200 (80 days), Summer Sweet 7600 (82      days), Summer Sweet 7800 (84 days), and Summer Sweet White      8601 (86 days). All are superb and very sweet.</p>      <p>      Also worth mentioning is a field corn called      Silvermine-a longtime favorite in the South, now      offered by Kilgore in two varieties: Hickory King and      Trucker's Favorite. Silvermine isn't as sugary as a true      sweet corn, but it's highly worm-resistant and yields      pearl-white, foot-long roasting ears.</p>      <p>      And for you popcorn growers, I can recommend the white      Bearpaw from Abundant Life Seed Foundation . . . the      Minihybrid White Hulless from Farmer's . . . and the      tender, yellow Hybrid A-3399 from Kilgore.    </p>    <h3>      Beans    </h3>    <p>      The winning bean variety in this year's trials is      Earliserve, from VBS-a cross between Bush Blue Lake and      Slenderette. Legacy is another fine Blue Lake type from      VBS. Then there's Green Lantern from Stokes, Salem from      Farmer's, Tenderlake by Liberty, Lake Largo by Midwest, and      Venture from Park. (The latter variety produces especially      tender pods.)</p>      <p>      Although yellow wax bush beans aren't generally as popular      as their green cousins, a couple of the new varieties might      pleasantly surprise you. Shepherd's offers Roc D'Or, a      fine, long-pod French variety with a light, buttery flavor      . . . and then there's Constanza from T&M, which is      also far superior to the wax beans I've grown in the      past.</p>      <p>      Are you thinking of planting limas this year? If so, and if      you live in the South, where nematodes are a problem, try      Porter's Nemagreen. Then again, should pole limas be your      favorites, go with Abundant Life's Bandy-a native      variety developed by the Hopi Indians of the American      Southwest. Bandy is an-exceptional bean that does      best in warmer climes.    </p>    <h3>      Tomatoes    </h3>        <p>      One of the best early tomatoes around these days is      Improved Summertime, from Porter. This one produces      medium-sized fruits that are hard to beat. Additionally,      Improved Summertime is resistant to both fusarium and      nematodes. Quite similar is Saltspring Sunrise, from      Abundant Life.    </p>    <p>      The best midseason tomatoes include Lorissa,      a sweet, Greek variety from Shepherd's, Better Bush VFN      from Park, and Hayslip (a jointless type) and Atlantic City      (a high-production hybrid)-both of which are from      Kilgore.    </p>    <h3>      The Beef Tomato    </h3>    <p>      For you yellow-tom lovers, I recommend Lemon Boy, a      revolutionary new VFN type from Park.    </p>    <p>      Leading the list of      promising new late-season varieties is Liberty Hybrid, one      of the astounding Professional Seed Series now offered by      Twilley. The Beef, from Henry Field, is a delicious      challenger for the "big 'un" title. Other superb giants are      the scarlet-fruited Heavyweight and the tasty Champion,      both from Porter.    </p>    <p>      One of the best stuff-mg tomatoes I've      grown in some time is Striped Cavern, from T&M. This      high-yield nonhybrid shows marked resistance to all known      tomato diseases, and its lovely, thick-walled fruitsred      with yellow stripes-resemble the common sweet pepper.    </p>    <p>      Finally, for a paste type, I'd go with the globe-shaped      GS-12 from VBS or Bellstar from Johnny's.    </p>    <h3>      Peppers    </h3>    <p>      Of the peppers, bells are probably the most popular with      gardeners, and the best of the early bells this year is the      compact Park's Pot, from Park. This plant can be grown in      the garden or in containers, requires little space, and      produces medium Mav/tune 1986 sized peppers. Pick-Me-Quick      is a superearlymaturing hybrid from Gurney.</p>      <p>      In the normal-season category, look to Harris for Annabelle      and to Henry Field for Big Bell. Both are quite large and      perfect for stuffing.</p>      <p>      One of the nicest yellow sweet peppers around today is the      Golden Summer Hybrid by Park-possibly the tastiest and most      productive yellow bell ever developed, with a growing time      of 67 days. Another dandy new yellow is Super Stuff from      Stokes, also a 67day maturer. Super Stuff is longerbodied      than traditional bells, thick-walled and great for      stuffing. A third promising new bell is Quadrato D'Oro from      Shepherd's. This one has a bit of tang to it, as opposed to      the sweet taste of Golden Summer and Super Stuff.</p>      <p>      Banana peppers are gaining in popularity, and Twilley has      one of the best in HyFry. This hybrid Cubanelle type      produces 5-1/2" fruits that are perfect for frying. A      similar variety is Key Largo, a heavy producer from Harris.      A third winner in this category is Top Banana from Porter,      with its exceptionally long, slim fruits.</p>      <p>      Some like 'em hot-and Yellow Squash is a golden yellow,      pattypan-shaped pepper from Porter that's extraordinarily      productive and hotter than hot.    </p>    <h3>      Eggplants    </h3>    <p>      One of the best eggplants I've ever grown is Epic, from      Twilley. This fine early hybrid produces lovely      purple-black, teardropshaped fruits that are perfect for      stuffing. Black Enorma from T&M is another excellent      new hybrid, much larger in size and two weeks later to      mature than Epic. Of the smaller varieties, Little Fingers,      from Harris, is a high-yield hybrid that's perfect for      frying. The only nonhybrid eggplant to excel in my trials      was Agora, from Shepherd's. Its large, lustrous, purple      fruits have none of the bitterness so common to eggplants.      And finally we have a real winner with Casper-a charming,      whitefruited, 70-day eggplant from Stokes.    </p>    <h3>      Cucumbers    </h3>        <p>      Twilley has four dandy cukes this season. First there's      Setmore 100, an early producer of lovely 8" fruits that are      disease-resistant and perfect for slicing. Another super      new hybrid is Twilley's Universal, with slender, delicious      fruit. Twilley's Dynasty is a Dashertype coke that matures      in 60 days and is well suited to greenhouse production. And      finally, there's Slice Nice, a big producer that's probably      the most popular of the four Twilley offerings.    </p>    <p>      Other outstanding new slicing cokes include Supersett and      Ultraslice, both from Stokes, and Streamliner from Burpee.      And winner of this season's "unique coke" award is Hylares,      a Middle Eastern variety offered by Shepherd's. The glossy,      bright green fruit of the Hylares is much milder than most      American-type slicing cokes-though the Burpless      Bush from Park is also mild, yielding large cokes from a      compact plant.    </p>    <h3>      Cream of the Crop    </h3>    <p>      By way of brief summary, and to refresh your memory on the      best of the many wonderful veggie varieties we've just      taken a look at, I'll list those that merit special special      attention. On a scale of one to ten, each of the following      rates a solid ten:    </p>    <p>      Gilfeather turnip from VBS and T&M,      Treta cabbage from Park, Tuodo carrot from Burpee, Summer      Delicious sweet corn from Liberty, The Beef tomato from      Henry Field, Golden Summer Hybrid pepper from Park, Super      Stuff pepper from Stokes, Casper eggplant from Stokes, and      the Slice Nice cucumber from Twilley.    </p>    <p>      Enough talk. Let's get growing!    </p>
