                          <p>      Richard and Maureen Pratt have been using photovoltaic      cells to generate electricity for chores around their North      Carolina home for over six years . . . in fact, several of      the photos that accompany this article are of the Pratts'      solarpowered tools. </p><p>The concept of benign, sun-produced      electricity originally seemed little more than a curiosity      to them . .. but upon discovering the amazing amount of      work that could be done with just one panel, the pair      became dedicated to the advancement of solar electricity.</p><p>      The Pratts' original panel has been on the job for five      years,. though cracks in its plastic covering allow it to      see only sunny-day exposure. But their new ARCO Solar      model, now residing on their roof, works come rain or      shine. It's used to run a 12-volt DC chain saw (it cut all      their firewood for the winter of 1980-81) . . . a      rototiller .. . a pump to irrigate their remote vegetable      garden . . . and a blower to provide air exchange in their      hybrid solar home.</p><p> The enthusiasm that Rick and Maureen      developed for sun power has led them to start their own      energy enterprise: They sell photovoltaic panels, 12-volt      tools and some appliances, solar air and water heaters,      woodburning stoves, and other alternative energy equipment.      Thus-for one couple-a fascination with better,      cleaner ways to produce energy has turned into a successful      business!
