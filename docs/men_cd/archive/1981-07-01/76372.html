                    <p>		<strong>OTHER SPECIES: AESTHETICS, INTEREST, AND ETHICS</strong>		</p>      <h5 id="byline">      by ANNE AND PAUL EHLRICH    </h5>		<hr />		    <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich(Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to      the words "population" ; "resources" , and "environment" in      the late 1960'x. (They also coined the term coevolution,      and did a lot to make ecology the household word it is      today.) But while most folks are aware ofthe Ehrlichs'      popular writing in the areasof ecology and overpopulation      (most of us for instancehave read Paul's book The      Population Bomb) . . . far too few people have any idea of      how deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological research      (research of the type that tends to be published only in      technical journals and college textbooks). That's why it      pleases us to be able to present-on a regular      basis-the following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.</em><br />      <br />      The direct and indirect economic benefits that human beings      receive from other species (discussed in MOTHER NOS. 57,      68, and 69) are potent reasons for deep concern about the      ongoing extinction of the world's plants, animals, and      microbes. But there are other, largely noneconomic, reasons      for doing our best to maintain the planet's biological      diversity . . . reasons which some people may think      trivial, but which others feel are among the most important      of all: that the species with which we share the earth are      beautiful, they're fascinating, and they have a      <em>right</em> to exist.<br />      <br />      The beauty of such organisms as butterflies, birds, reef      fishes, and flowering plants is widely recognized. But many      less well-known fauna and flora are-when viewed      objectively-attractive also. For example, some tiny      wasps and flies, if seen under a microscope, appear to be      fashioned out of solid gold. And the algae known as diatoms      have glasslike shells that are as exquisite and varied as      snowflakes.<br />      <br />      Indeed, all organisms at least exhibit the beauty of      design. Even the tiniest beetles-some of which are      scarcely larger than a period on this page-have      complete external skeletons, nervous and digestive systems,      and complex sets of muscles. Such insects show a degree of      sophisticated miniaturization as yet unapproached by human      engineers.<br />      <br />      <strong>AESTHETIC DIVERSIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      In addition to their conventional beauty, living organisms      have what might be called a "beauty of interest". Their      diversity of form and behavior is a potential source of      infinite fascination fn a world often hungry for diversion.      This quality is attested to by the immense popularity of      such hobbies as bird watching and the keeping of tropical      fish.<br />      <br />      The insects, however, are among the least appreciated of      our aesthetic resources. But, as one becomes acquainted      with them, they'll often stop looking like an amorphous mob      of bugs and come to be seen as a highly differentiated      group of the rivets holding Spaceship Earth to gether. Take      beetles, for instance. There are probably over a million      species of the hardshelled insects. In fact, when a lady      asked the famous British biologist J.B.S. Haldane what one      could conclude about the nature of the Creator by studying      His or Her creations, Haldane is reputed to have replied      that He or She must surely have had "an inordinate fondness      for beetles".<br />      <br />      It certainly is true that members of this particular order      of insects display a great variety of shapes and sizes. The      giant rhinoceros beetle of the tropics, for instancewhich      is the heaviest of all insects-weighs more than the      smallest mammals . . . and the males of the species use      their grotesque horns in fierce Lilliputian battles over      females. Last December, near Iguazu Falls in southwestern      Brazil, we picked up some of these big insects to bring      home to John Holdren's teenage son, who is a devout beetle      collector. The "rhinos" were so strong that they easily      walked through plastic bags and forced their way out of      cardboard boxes!<br />      <br />      Indeed, books could be written about beetle behavior.      Bombardier beetles, for example, can shoot a hot,      unpleasant spray from their tails at their enemies.      Fireflies (a kind of beetle) use their flashing lights to      arrange meetings for mating . . . and the females of some      lightning bug species even flash the "code" of      <em>other</em> species and then devour the hapless amorous      males that come flying in! Other insects perform in equally      unusual ways.<br />      <br />      In short, insects display the same kind of beauty and      intricacy that captivates gun collectors, airplane and      train buffs, philatelists, science fiction and computer      enthusiasts, bibliophiles, and so on. Therefore, even if      insects didn't play crucial roles in our ecosystems, the      loss of their diversity would make our world a much less      interesting place.<br />      <br />      <strong>KNOWLEDGE BREEDS COMPASSION<br />      <br /></strong> As humankind gets to know its fellow      creatures, interest is often followed by compassion.      Numerous books and television documentaries about      whales-combined with the performances of killer whales in      marine parks-have, in recent years, transformed      people's attitudes toward these highly intelligent animals.      Once the great mammals were simply considered to be a      source of oil and meat. Today their welfare has become a      matter of great concern for many human beings.<br />      <br />      One turning point in human relationships with these gentle      giants was the discovery that humpback whales sing long,      complex, beautiful songs. These melodies may last for as      long as 30 minutes and may be repeated verbatim      indefinitely. The songs-clearly audible through the      hulls of ships-were the basis of many seamen's legends . .      . and we've been lucky enough to hear them ourselves, both      underwater and in the cabin of a sailboat.<br />      <br />      It's hard to imagine how someone who has watched humpbacks      jumping clear of the water like gigantic salmon or      "lobtailing" (lifting their flukes and, like beavers,      slapping the surface of the water with them) could kill      these animals for dog food! Most of the hundreds of      thousands of tourists who've seen the whales cavort in the      waters off Maui's beaches in Hawaii would agree with Herman      Melville's early description of the humpback: "He is the      most gamesome and lighthearted of all the whales, making      more gay foam and white water generally than any other of      them.<br />      <br />      <strong>"HUMAN ARROGANCE"</strong>    </p>    <p>      The compassion that many of us feel for other life forms      creates the basis of what some consider the most potent      argument in favor of preserving other species. The      contention is basically a religious one: that our fellow      passengers on Spaceship Earth, who may be our only living      companions in the entire universe, <em>have a right to      exist .<br />      <br /></em> David Ehrenfeld, in his thought-provoking      book <em>The Arrogance of Humanism</em> , called this the      "Noah Principle". . . naming it after the best-known practi      tioner of conservation in history. In Ehrenfeld's view,      species and communities should be conserved "because they      exist and because this existence is itself but the present      expression of a continuing historical process of immense      antiquity and majesty. Long-standing existence in Nature .      . . carries with it the unimpeachable right to continued      existence."<br />      <br />      Many individuals-from Buddha on-have      questioned whether human beings have the right to kill      other animals at all, let alone push any species to      extinction . . . which is to play God. To many such people,      including Ehrenfeld, the elimination of a unique group of      organisms must be the ultimate form of arrogance, and must      be based upon a conviction that human beings are the only      important form of life and that they alone should decide      whether others should be permitted to live or not.<br />      <br />      Of course, there's no scientific way to "prove" that      nonhuman organisms (or, for that matter, humans themselves)      have a right to exist. But we and others believe that along      with the preeminence that <em>Homo sapiens</em> has      achieved goes a very great moral responsibility-a      stewardship, if you will-upon which we must not turn      our backs. Perhaps especially because we have the power to      destroy them, <em>we must respect the rights of our      co-inhabitants of Earth.<br />      <br /></em> There has been a historical trend toward      expanding the notion of "rights" to include creatures other      than Homo sapiens. A century ago, for example, it was      permissible to beat a horse to death if it was your      "property". Today, horses are legally protected against      such abuse. Indeed, the idea that other animals have      intrinsic rights is now widespread. This change in attitude      is seen in the general revulsion at such spectacles as the      Canadian slaughter of baby seals and the killing of      dolphins by Japanese fishing crews . . . and it's enshrined      in our humane laws.<br />      <br />      We think the trend should be further encouraged, however,      so that "rights" can be extended even further . . . beyond      domestic animals to plants and, perhaps, even to such      inanimate components of ecosystems as rocks and landforms.      Such a notion was proposed by the famous conservationist      Aldo Leopold in 1948, when he called for the development of      a "land ethic" in which the "land" (he used the term as      shorthand for "natural ecosystems") would be used but not      abused. He wrote, "A land ethic changes the role of      <em>Homo sapiens</em> from conqueror of the land-community      to plain member of it. It implies respect for his fellow      members and also respect for the community as such."<br />      <br />      The development of an ethic of respect would probably be      the very best way to save humanity from the catastrophic      effects of its assault on organic diversity. Of course,      such an ethic would have to transcend immediate economic      considerations. (In the <em>long</em> term it would have      extremely positive economic effects.) As conservationist      Rod Nash once most colorfully put it: "One does not      consider the price [of defense] if someone threatens to      rape one's daughter. With environmental ethics a reality,      the same might be true of attempts to rape the land."<br />      <br />      <strong>A TOUCH OF BRIGHTNESS AND LIGHT</strong>    </p>    <p>      However, the general acceptance of the notion that other      species have rights will probably be long in gaining      acceptance. For example, a few years back many millions of      Americans got to know a mountain gorilla named Digit . . .      when he appeared with primatologist Dian Fossey in a      National Geographic Society television special. He had, in      a very real sense, become a friend of Dian's, and the      documentary showed him examining her pen and her notebook .      . . gently returning each one . . . and then lying down and      going to sleep by her side.<br />      <br />      But on the last day of 1977, Digit was speared to death by      some poachers in Rwanda's Parc des Volcans. Five mortal      thrusts felled him as he remained behind to buy time,      allowing more vulnerable members of his family group to      flee. He was killed by people who wanted the head and hands      of a "silverback" male to make into souvenirs for      tourists.<br />      <br />      Dian christened Digit's baby, conceived before his death,      "Mwelu" (the name is Swahili for "a touch of brightness and      light"). Many people hope that Mwelu will have a chance for      a normal gorilla existence, but others ask, "What good are      gorillas?" . . . and conclude that the large apes are      really of no value at all. Such men and women believe that      killing Digit was right, and that the best use of the      remaining gorilla habitat in the park would be to convert      it to grazing land.<br />      <br />      The latter attitude is so widespread today that we      sometimes wonder whether there's any real hope of a new      ethic spreading fast enough to save the Mwelus of the      planet . . . or Homo sapiens. As yet, far too few people      realize that our fate is inextricably intertwined with that      of the beings our species is so heedlessly pushing toward      extinction. Human life is as dependent upon the continued      existence of these other essential components of Earth's      ecosystems as they are dependent upon us to spare them.      Perhaps that reality, if nothing else, will at last give      birth to compassion and respect for life in "practical"      people.      </p>			<hr />		<p>	      <em>For an expanded treatment of this subject, see Paul and      Anne Ehrlich's Ex tinction: The Causes and Consequences of      the Disappearance of (Random House, New York, 1981, $15.95)      on which this column is based.
