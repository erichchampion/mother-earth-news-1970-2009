                <p>      <strong>Report From Them That's Doin</strong>    </p>    		<hr />    <p>      Although he was initially skeptical, this MOTHER-reader      later wrote to us for an idea that has helped his family      realize their homestead dream.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Richard Grazzini		</h5>		<p>	      I have to begin this tale by admitting that the first time      I read Jim and Lou Hammill's article in MOTHER NO. 43, "We      Live Rent-Free in the Smokies", I laughed out loud. A      landlord would have to be <em>bonkers</em> to lease a house      to someone without collecting any money, I thought. Labor      for rent? I figured the Hammills must just have had a      once-in-a-lifetime stroke of luck. Still, the article did      plant an idea in the back of my mind.<br />      <br />      I'm a married graduate student with two small children. My      family lived (actually, existed might be more accurate) for      three years in a small apartment . . . while I obtained a      master's degree in horticulture at Purdue University. We      really wanted to homestead, though, and read books on the      subject, made lists, and planned. But the dream seemed to      stay well ahead of the small amount of cash we could save      from my graduate assistant's salary.<br />      <br />      Still, when I finished at Purdue and planned to move on to      Penn State to work for my doctorate, my wife and I decided      at least to <em>shop</em> for a small place in the country.      We looked, but could find only exorbitant prices and      imposing interest rates.<br />      <br />      Needless to say, we were depressed. But then I recalled the      Hammills' article in issue 43 . . . and decided that their      idea was worth a try. We quickly composed a classified      advertisement for the county newspaper in the area where      we'd been house-hunting: "WANTED TO RENT. NEED SEPTEMBER      '80, country home 15 miles State College. Two, three      bedrooms, garden, yard. Christian student/family. Rental      preferred, purchase possible. Experienced handyman, will      trade rent for repairs.<br />      <br />      " We sent the ad off, waited, and prayed. The first      response offered a rental for cash <em>plus</em> labor . .      . but even then, the amount was more than our budget could      afford. A second reply said we sounded like "nice people"      (which we are!) . . . but the woman's house didn't      <em>need</em> any work and was far too expensive for us to      lease. We needed to pay most of our rent with sweat, not      cash.<br />      <br />      Offer number three was the charm, though. A man wrote to      say he and his wife had just purchased a farm as an      investment. The former owner had begun to do some      remodeling but hadn't completed the job.<br />      <br />      Well, to make a long story short, we visited the place and      fell in love with it. It was exactly what we had wanted to      buy but couldn't afford. (Actually, that's not      <em>quite</em> true . . . the homestead was <em>better</em>      than any we'd ever dreamed of owning.) There were      grapevines, apple trees, a huge yard, garden space, two      creeks, a barn, and a pasture. The two-story farmhouse      featured five bedrooms and had a woodburner . . . and there      was even a timber lot from which to harvest fuel for the      heater!<br />      <br />      I must admit that I was a bit concerned about the 60-mile      round trip to school every day that living on the dream      farm would neccessitate. We soon decided the trade-off was      well worthwhile, however, and worked up a rental agreement      with our landlords: At least half of the rent each month      would be paid with labor. We initially gave the owners one      month's payment in cash, so that-from then      on-any work we accomplished would be deducted (at an      agreed-upon hourly rate) from the <em>following</em>      month's rent.<br />      <br />      Naturally, it would be in our best interest to work all the      rent off, but my studies don't allow me that much time to      spend on the remodeling jobs. As it stands now, each      month's payment includes 34 hours of labor . . . which      keeps me busy for about three Saturdays every month. Our      landlords provide all the necessary building supplies, and      if we ever need to buy any "last minute" items, we simply      deduct the costs from the cash portion of the next month's      rent. We've found that the setup works very well,      particularly when we keep accurate records of time      <em>and</em> materials.<br />      <br />      Everything has rolled along smoothly so far. We've already      ripped out an old porch and used the wood to make compost      bins . . . done a lot of painting and wiring work . . . and      spent a few weekends cutting our woodstove "fodder". A      nearby farmer volunteered to plow our quarter-acre garden      space "just to be a good neighbor" . . . and so-for      the same reason-I gave him a goodly supply of winter      squash at the end of the season.<br />      <br />      Furthermore, shortly after we had moved to the farm, a      friend of our landlords began to board her horse with us.      In return for our keeping an eye on the animal and feeding      it whenever she can't come over, the owner supplies us with      fresh, tasty goat's milk.<br />      <br />      Not long thereafter we learned that another of the owners'      friends needed a place to pasture his small herd of cattle.      We <em>jumped</em> at the chance to be able to practice      livestock tending without having the financial      responsibility! And not only did the man bring five beef      steers . . . he brought a Holstein cow and calf, 24 banty      chickens, and eight cats as well!<br />      <br />      My wife and I have, since that day, learned to milk and      give vaccinations (we doctored the youngest Hereford      through pneumonia), and now possess what we like to call "a      farmer's eye". . . which has enabled us (so far) to spot      livestock problems before they get serious. The Holstein      provides us with all the milk we can drink-      <em>plus</em> plenty of butter and cottage cheese-and      feeds the cats and calf. We also deliver three gallons of      milk to our landlords each week . . . and they deduct the      price from our rent. What's more, the bantams have begun to      lay, and those fresh eggs are welcome additions to our      larder!<br />      <br />      Some series of swaps, huh? And the idea came from you,      MOTHER. We want to thank you so much, because the original      trade (and your magazine) allowed us to live on a homestead      we couldn't have hoped to see for years . . .      <em>without</em> either the mortgage we expected to pay or      the cash outlay we thought inevitable. And, probably best      of all, we're getting a farmer's education for free . . .      as well as making good friends along the way!<br />      <br />    </p>
