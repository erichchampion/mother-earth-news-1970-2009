Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28791</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us (in about 500 words) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"-you      started your venture. Because if your story can be fitted      into an upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES,      you'll receive [1] the warm satisfaction of knowing that      you helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy and      (2) a free two-year new or renewal subscription to THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .<br />    </p>        <p>      On a hot, sultry August night in 1968 I came to the      realization that I needed a new challenge. "We've got to      get a hobby," I said to my wife. "And, considering the way      prices are rising, it'd be nice if we could find one that'd      bring in some cash!" Well, Kathy (a home economics      instructor) was interested in both sewing and knitting, and      I (a draftsman) liked to draw and work with my hands. So we      figured we ought to be able to come up with an activity      that could involve us both.<br />      <br />      Our first project was creating Barbie Doll dresses and      Barbie-sized racks and wardrobes. With only $10 in seed      money we bought yarn, thread, Barbie patterns (two, at 50!      apiece), fabric scraps, and craft magazines ... and soon      Kathy was selling our handiwork.<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, we learned the hard way that a good craft      business doesn't grow overnight. We collected a total of      only $100 during the first two years of our hobby. That sum      went back into the business, of course, and we added      knitted items, refrigerator magnets, and Christmas tree      ornaments to our line of products. And, while we were      diversifying, we started reading THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      (restricted) ": Articles like "How to Make $1,000 a Week Making      Candles" (in MOTHER NO. 11, page 67), for instance, gave us      hope that our part-time recreational activity might someday      earn us enough money to let us spend more time at it. So we      kept right on working, and enjoying our somewhat profitable      pastime . . . in years three through six of our enterprise      we earned about $500 annually.    </p>        <p>      But then we <em>really</em> started using our heads. We      dropped 95% of all our craft production except for our felt      and calico Christmas tree ornaments . . . which we      increased by 100%. We had found our specialty, and we      proceeded to get better at it pretty quickly. We also      picked up some tips from "How to Start and Run a Profitable      Craft Business" in MOTHER NO. 50 (page 50), and our      husband-and-wife enterprise began to get up steam. We first      placed holiday ornaments in local craft shops on a      consignment system. Then-as the stores ordered more      and more items-we began to work strictly on a "cash      on delivery" basis . . . and now we have to turn orders      away. Our annual investment is up to $800, but last year      (our twelfth in the craft business) we grossed over      $5,000!<br />      <br />      The most important piece of advice Kathy and I can offer      aspiring craftspersons is this: Stress quality, not      quantity: Excellence is what real craft lovers are after!      It's our belief that our emphasis on making the best      products we can has helped our bootstrap business      grow.<br />      <br />      Lee & Kathy Mathwig<br />      Sheboygan Fails, Wis.</p><p> Years ago, while traveling with my      serviceman son, I made friends with a goodly number of his      buddies' children. The youngsters came to refer to me as      "Grandma", and we often grew so close that I'd write to      them after their families were transferred.<br />      <br />      Later I moved to a farm that's situated 30 miles from the      nearest town . . . where I soon had a fine family of farm      animals, including an assortment of cats and dogs, a goat      named Pandora, and a beautiful white rabbit that goes by      the name of Elephant. But I was <em>still</em> Grandma to a      lot of those youngsters I'd started corresponding      with.<br />      <br />      Well, I was looking for a way to supplement my income at      home when I happened across Steve Brown's article, "You Can      Start Your Own Publishing Business", in MOTHER NO. 38 (page      86). After I read that piece, I thought about how much      <em>fun it</em> would be to publish something I had written      myself . . . and I thought about the ever-present pile of      to-be-answered letters from adopted grandchildren on my      desk . . and I thought about all my wonderful, funny animal      friends ... and then all those notions kind of added up in      my brain. The <em>result</em> was <em>Notes From</em>      <em>Raggedy's</em> <em>Mailbox, a</em> monthly newsletter      for children . . . which is from "Grandma", and all about      life on the homestead. Just $70 got it going: $15 for      advertising, $40 for printing and another $15 for      postage.<br />      <br />      Now I'm grossing about $60 a month (and the amount is      steadily increasing), "Raggedy's" circulation is growing,      and the population of animals that make up the newsletter's      cast of characters is thriving. If your child would like to      get to know a goat that "rides" a motorcycle, a pig that      rubs against your leg like a cat, a herd of goats that come      running like dogs when they're called, and a nice farm      woman named "Grandma" who feeds and waters them all . . .      send $10 for a year's subscription-or $1.00 for a      sample copy-to:<br />      <br />      Phyllis Bowen<br />      Raggedy Ranch<br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      R.R.<br />      Woodbine, Kan. 67492</p><p> Working 50 hours and more a      week-with no overtime pay and no chance of      advancement-gradually became too grim a situation for      me to be satisfied with. I was chief draftsman for a steel      fabrication shop, and I liked my work . . . but not my job.      Then, in November of 1978, I read "Mother Types at Home" by      Marsha K. Strong (in MOTHER NO. 54, page 801, and although      I'm no good at typing and certainly not a mother, this      article gave me the inspiration I needed to start an "at      home" business<br />      <br />      I'm now running my own drafting service, working chiefly      for engineering firms and fabricators (including my former      employer) Most of my jobs to date have come from the      phosphate, citrus, and tourist industries of central      Florida. I've also made drawings for the new Orlando      International Airport and for Wait Disney World, <em>and      traveled</em> as far away as Escanaba Michigan . . . where      I mapped out a dust collection system for a transportation      company.<br />      <br />      My most productive advertising is by word of mouth. On      almost every job, I meet someone else with a "little      project" requiring drawings ... so it seems that I've      finally been able to combine the work I love with a "job" I      enjoy.<br />      <br />      Since I'd been drafting for a number of years before I      started my own enterprise, I already had most of the      reference books and some of the tools that I needed. But I      didn't have the kind of equipment that a <em>company</em>      usually provides, such as a blueprint machine and office      furniture. I purchased such items, used, from business      people in my area (most of those folks really seemed to      want the newcomer to succeed!), and I'll continue buying      equipment as the need arises, of course . .. but my initial      investment came to less than $1,000.<br />      <br />      After four months of running my company, I find that I put      in fewer hours than I used to, and -though I'm not      yet earning more money than in my former job-I'm      working for <em>myself,</em> I enjoy my labor a whole lot      more, and I still gross $8.75 an hour, plus expenses!    </p>    <p>      Earl F. Coell Mount Dora, Fla.    </p>    <p>      Since I enjoy a job that gives me a chance to meet a lot of      people-especially youngsters-it seemed natural      for me to start a summer bootstrap business operating a      bell-ringing ice cream truck. And "How to Go to Work for      Yourself" in MOTHER NO. 52 (page 36) gave me just the push      I needed to get that wagon rolling.<br />      <br />      Before I went to work, however, I had to purchase a vehicle      to haul my frozen delicacies around in. I bought a 1963      Chevy van for $200, and spent $200 more to paint my truck,      put a window into its curb side to sell from, and install a      set of burglar alarm bells to provide my "come and get it"      ring (which turned out to be the only advertisement the      traveling ice cream store ever needed). Then I got      clearance from the local board of health, purchased a      seller's license for about $50, and headed for the ice      cream supplier . . . who lent me a good freezer      and-for less than $50-furnished me with a      selection of his 12 most popular frozen desserts. (Decide      on the quantity according to how much you think you can      sell and how much you can afford to buy. If you're starting      out with minimal funds, you can always go <em>back</em> to      the supplier after you've sold enough of the tasty treats      to build up your stock of cash.)<br />      <br />      Then I headed out and started working up my route (it's      important to establish a regular itinerary as quickly as      possible). I went to factories, service stations, and      business places-trying to hit each at the most      strategic time of day and, after school hours, to      residential areas. It doesn't take long to loam which      locations are worth returning to and which should be      dropped. And you'd better believe that one of the best ways      to draw a crowd is to keep those truck bells constantly      ringing!<br />      <br />      Being an ice cream man isn't an easy job: The hours are      long, and the work requires a goodly portion of      self-discipline (after all, there's a constant temptation      to "eat into" your profits). But it has netted me as much      as $100 a day . .. and given me many a dose of sunshine      from happy children's faces!<br />      <br />      Tom Deverin Floyd, Va.    </p>
