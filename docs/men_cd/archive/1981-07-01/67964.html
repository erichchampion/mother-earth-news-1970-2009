                		<hr />    <p>      Although it cost non more than a comparable "surface"      structure, this earth-sheltered home satisfies the majority      of its own heating and cooling needs    </p>        <p>      In north Florida's subtropical panhandle region-where      summertime humidity can average a clammy 82%, and      temperatures in the 90's aren't even considered noteworthy      enough to <em>comment</em> on-cooling a dwelling is      usually of greater concern than is warming it. On the other      hand, though, heating requirements can't be ignored      <em>altogether</em> , since the region <em>is</em> subject      to nearly 1,600 heating degree-days during its cold season.</p><p>      Understandably enough, designing a passive solar home to      suit such fluctuating conditions could present quite a      challenge . . . but the folks at Tallahassee's Mad Dog      Design and Construction Company felt that, by taking      advantage of several "tried and true" locally popular      building techniques and coupling them with modern thermal      conditioning methods, they could come up with a house that      would be comfortable throughout the year . . . but which      would require little or no utility-supplied power for      heating or cooling.    </p>    <h3>      A WELL-PLANNED DESIGN    </h3>    <p>      Essentially, the Florida builders used several      <em>passive</em> methods-backed up by two active      systems-to insure a pleasant interior climate during      the hot summer months. First and foremost, the      earth-sheltered structure relies on natural ventilation,      combined with heat-gain prevention, to maintain a      comfortable internal environment.      Borrowing from traditional local designs (which, of course,      evolved to suit the area's climate), the Sunshine Staters      utilized high ceilings, continuous attic-linked soffit      vents, and strategically placed windows to encourage the      flow of air throughout the house.</p><p> For example, the      south-facing solarium/greenhouse area incorporates ceiling      mounted outlets that can be opened, in case of overheating,      to allow warm air to duct into the attic and out the soffit      vents. Similarly, in the house itself-which is      separated from the solarium by a quartet of sliding glass      doors-unwanted warmth can be vented around four      movable 8' X 8' insulated ceiling shutters.      These horizontally hinged overhead "flaps" are mounted in      light wells which are framed into the front of the attic      and faced with acrylic glazing. When the electrically      operated sky shutters are three-quarters open, pockets are      formed, which accumulate warm air and direct it upward . .      . while permitting plenty of indirect light to brighten the      rooms below.</p><p>      Other heat-controlling elements in the unique design      include [1] roof overhangs above the skylights, [2] solar      screening over the greenhouse windows during the warmer      months, [3] insulated draperies on the sliding glass doors,      and [4] ceiling insulation with an R-value of 28.      Additionally, the builders have taken advantage of      deciduous trees to help shade the structure in the summer      months.</p><p> Another factor that contributes to the energy      efficiency of the Tallahassee residence is the dwelling's      earth sheltering itself. Calculations made prior to      construction had indicated that a large portion of the      necessary tempering could be accomplished by using the soil      as a massive heat sink, since about two-thirds of the      building's wall area-as well as its entire      floor-were slated to be below ground level.      However, data gathered later showed that earth temperatures      low enough for cooling purposes could be found only at a      depth greater than five feet . . . so, to compensate for      the fact that the earth-bermed structure was not      <em>wholly</em> engulfed in soil, the Mad Dog designers      merely insulated its surrounding earthen ramparts with a      two-inch-thick Styrofoam beadboard skirt that extends      outward eight feet from the home's concrete walls.<br />      <br />      This protective "collar"-after being covered with      waterproof sheeting <em>and</em> 12 inches of      backfill-serves to minimize the effect of the sun and      ambient air on the soil below (creating stable and      comfortable temperatures at a depth of only four feet, even      during the hottest months). It also provides an effective      watershed that directs surface flow away from, rather than      along, the sides of the building.</p><p> And the innovative      designers didn't stop there:      The Sunbelters also took the opportunity to bury a Givoni      air tube (so named after its developer, Dr. Baruch Givoni)      and a temperature sensor deep within the bean . . .      allowing the home's residents to force cool evening air      through the system to offset the effects of any heat gained      during the day.</p><p> Several backup methods of comfort control      were incorporated into the dwelling, as well.      A whole-house attic fan-located in a central      corridor-supplies additional positive ventilation as      required ... and a 1-1/2-ton heat pump can be activated if      air conditioning is needed (the unit is also capable of      operating, more economically, as a noncooling dehumidifier      alone).</p><p> When the winter months arrive, many of the same      features that <em>prevent</em> heat accumulation in the      summer can act to retain warmth.      Because the cold season's sun is low and the deciduous      trees have long since shed their leaves by then, the house      receives ample insolation through the unshielded solarium      glazing and the fully opened ceiling shutters . . . which      can be closed at night to hold the day-gathered warmth in.      Furthermore, the contact between the earth berm and the      massive structure provides a 45-day "thermal lag" . . .      which, in effect, permits the earthstored temperature      extremes of the late summer to be dissipated over a period      that extends about a month and a half into the cool season,      thus helping with the heating load.    </p>        <p>      <strong>ENGINEERING CUTS COSTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Normally, an earth-sheltered structure will start its      "life" as an assembly of filled concrete block walls      resting upon a reinforced monolithic slab . . .      or-alternatively-8- to 12-inch poured      bulkheads, on footings, surrounding a "floating"      foundation.      However, because the soil found at the building site has      low permeability and is potentially unstable, the designers      decided to utilize <em>post-tensioned</em> components,      which would stand the effect of lateral loads or twisting      resulting from shifting earth much better than would      conventional methods of construction.<br />      <br />      Post-tensioning, a comparatively new technique in the      home-building industry, is in many ways ideal for use in      earth-sheltered construction. Most important, it imparts      additional compressive and tensile strength to any member      upon which it's used.      Unlike regular reinforced concrete construction (in which      the steel rebar can begin to resist a load only after the      concrete itself has <em>failed</em> ), a post-tensioned      component incorporates a network of interwoven      cables-encased in lubricated plastic sleeves and cast      in the middle of the slab on three-foot centers-which      are pulled to a tension of about 30,000 pounds after the      pour sets, and locked in place by means of engineered      wedges mounted in stressing anchors.      This fantastic force puts the concrete under constant      compression and increases its strength without the need for      excessive mass (the four-inch floor slab is designed to      support 3,500 pounds per square inch . . . a 40% greater      load than a conventionally built pad of the same thickness      could withstand).</p><p> Equally significant, post-tensioning can      be accomplished right at the building site, using little      special equipment.      This do-it-yourself factor, in turn, allows for some      creativity on the part of the builders . . . as      evidenced-in the Tallahassee home-by the exposed      aggregate finish on the solarium's interior walls: They      were poured in forms lined with a one-inch layer of river      rock, then removed with the stone fagade intact.<br />      <br />      Finally, the use of the "pulling after pouring" technique      can help cut materials costs. Recent studies of      post-tensioned structures and "typical" earth-sheltered      buildings show that only about half as much steel, and      perhaps 40% as much concrete, will be required when a house      is tensioned rather than conventionally poured . . .      <em>and</em> the resulting shell is less likely to crack.      So, although waterproofing is still necessary with any      post-tensioned wall, the use of exotic (and costly)      materials can be eliminated.</p><p> Because the north Florida      dwelling was primarily designed to provide passive cooling      rather than heating,      the people at Mad Dog chose not to insulate the concrete      mass. Instead, they merely poured their floor slab over a      bed of gravel and waterproofing, installed footing drains,      then tilted up the previously poured-and-tensioned wall      panels and positioned them in perimeter slots that had been      cast into the foundation.      The "box" thus created was held together with steel corner      brackets, and laterally supported by a series of stout      cables which are strung between interlocking top plates on      the rear wall and concrete "deadmen" sunk in the ground      behind the structure. All the bulkhead surfaces were      covered with a continuous layer of "Tu-Tuf" flexible lining      material . . . then the house was bermed as described      previously.</p><p> And, rather than covering the building's top      with a layer of earth (which would have required a whole      slew of additional engineering computations and upped the      materials expense), the designers merely installed      oversized roof trusses, and built a conventional-but      well-insulated-asphalt-shingled "lid" . . . accepting      what they feel are only minor thermal losses as a result.    </p>    <h3>      ENERGY SAVINGS AT STANDARD PRICES    </h3>    <p>      The bottom line, though, is cost . . . and this      1,750-square-foot dwelling was constructed for about $35      per square foot, which is a good price even for aboveground      houses in today's market.      After living in it for nearly a full year, the owner states      that the home works even better than she expected . . .      thanks largely to the fact that she thoroughly understands      how it functions, and willingly takes an active part in      matching its capabilities to the fluctuations of the      weather.      Of course, one of the beauties of this particular home is      that it works well in either a passive or an active      mode.      So, although an occupant who's insensitive to its design      would be penalized by higher utility costs, one who works      <em>with</em> the passive systems will enjoy considerable      savings . . . and a comfortable passage through the      seasons, as well!    </p>
