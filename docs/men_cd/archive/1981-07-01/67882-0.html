        TOP: When you go out foraging for groundcherries, don't be fooled by Chinese Lanterns . . . which are a nonedible, ornamental species. RIGHT: Although this sweet, tomato-like fruit can be cultivated, the wild versions-such as these roadside plants-are equally delicious. BELOW: Ground-cherry pie is many folks' favorite way of fixing husk tomatoes, but be sure to try them with cereal, on ice cream . . . and as a tasty jam
