                <p>      <em><strong>You can forage (or grow) the fixin's for this      almost forgotten treat from Grandmother's      day:</strong></em>    </p>     <p>      <em>Photos By The Author</em>    </p>		        <h5 id="byline">by       Laura Boyle    </h5>		 <p>      When I serve ground-cherry pie to my guests, the very few      people who have ever tasted the treat before usually react      with remarks like, "Oh, I remember when my grandmother used      to make this" . . . or, "My great-aunt baked these for      special occasions!" However, most folks have never heard      of-much less tasted-this delicious fruit . . .      and that always astounds me, because groundcherries have      been included in our family gardens for at least four      generations!    </p>		         <h3>GROWING WILD</h3>  <p>      As a matter of fact, it isn't even necessary to      <em>cultivate</em> ground cherries, since they're commonly      found in fields, along roadsides, and in open woods and      waste-lands in every part of the United States except      Alaska. (Not long ago I discovered a patch of the wild      fruit on a grassy embankment just two blocks from my      Minnesota home.)    </p>    <p>      These fast-growing species of the genus <em>Physalis</em>      are also known as husk tomatoes, tomatilloes, strawberry      tomatoes, bladder cherries, and poppers (the Chinese      Lantern is a popular, nonedable ornamental variety), and      they belong to the Solanaceae family, which includes      tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes, tobacco, and nightshade.    </p>    <p>      The plants, while widespread, are usually not very abundant      in the wild, so to assure a <em>big</em> harvest, it's best      to cultivate them from seed . . . which can be ordered from      L.L. Olds Seed Company, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 7790, Madison,      Wisconsin 53707 (50 cents per package, and the firm's      catalog is free) or De Giorgi Company, Inc., Dept. TMEN,      P.O. Box 413, Council Bluffs, Iowa 51502 (40 cents per      package, and the catalog is 66 cents) .    </p>    <p>      Expect this garden crop-which prefers medium-dry      soil-to sprout early and grow rapidly. It quickly      puts out yellow flowers with brown or purple centers, and      will continue to bloom and bear until the first frost.      Around July, the fruit (which develops in a husk) will      begin to drop to the ground and-even though it's not      fully ripe when it does so-you should gather the      cherries as they fall, since they're favorites of many      animals and birds.    </p>    <p>      Inside the husk, you'll find a small berry-about half      an inch in diameter-with a tomatolike skin and, when      ripe, a sweet flavor similar to that of a strawberry. The      color of the mature cherry will vary from species to      species: It may be yellow, red, purple, or brown. And      (again, according to the species in question) it can be      poisonous when green . . . so be sure to let the fruit      ripen in the husk until it's soft and sweet. (I have often      stored the unhusked cherries for months. In fact, I was      once able to prepare a fresh ground-cherry pie for      Christmas dinner!)    </p>         <h3>ENJOYABLE EATING</h3>      <p>      I think husk tomatoes are as tasty as any fruit when simply      served with cream and sugar, or with a good dry cereal.      They're also a delicious addition to vanilla ice cream, and      can be preserved if covered with a syrup made of 1 cup of      sugar, 2 cups of water, and a little lemon juice . . .      simmered until tender . . . and frozen.    </p>    <p>      To prepare a ground-cherry jam, crush 4 cups of fully ripe      fruit so that each berry is broken . . . add lemon juice      and a package of pectin . . . bring the mixture to a boil .      . . stir in 4 cups of sugar . . . and <em>reboil</em> the      jam for 1 minute. (The spread is a fine topping for      buckwheat pancakes!)    </p>    <p>      But my favorite way, by far, to eat ground-cherries is in a      pie. To make this festive dish, combine 2 cups of sugar      with 2 tablespoons of flour and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.      Then, add 4 cups of husked, ripe cherries . . . 2      tablespoons of melted butter or margarine . . . and 2      tablespoons of lemon juice. Pour the filling into a 9"      unbaked pie crust, cover it with another sheet of dough,      cut a few slits in the top for venting, and bake itat      350Â°F-for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the crust is      golden.    </p>    <p>      As Grandma knew, this pie will turn even an ordinary meal      into a very special occasion!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Folks who'd like to avoid using white, sugar      in the foregoing recipes can substitute honey to taste and      thicken with. cornstarch or-for jam-"Magic      Pectin", as we recommended in MOTHER NO. 59. page 23 (see      page 112 to order back issues).    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, never to forage any wild plants without the      aid of n local expert and/or a good field guide.    </p>

RIGHT: Although this sweet, tomato-like fruit can be cultivated, the wild versions-such as these roadside plants-are equally delicious. BELOW: Ground-cherry pie is many folks' favorite way of fixing husk tomatoes, but be sure to try them with cereal, on ice cream . . . and as a tasty jam
