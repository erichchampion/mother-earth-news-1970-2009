                <p>      In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of humankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on banter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced      our stillstanding offer: Anyone (and that means you!) who      sends us a short (about 300 words) account of an actual      barter that's good enough to print will receive-as      the folks on the following page have-a twelve-month      subscription (or extension of same) to THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS (restricted) .    </p>        <p>      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , Inc., P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28791    </p>    <p>      My husband and I started our married life-just as      we'd planned to for six years-with a move to the      country. And barter has played a major role in our new      lifestyle . . . by providing us with food and shelter.    </p>    <p>      Our trading began when a little determination (and a little      luck) landed us a part-time milking job on a fairly large      dairy farm. In exchange for one week's work a month (on      days of our choosing), we live rent-free, in a fine      two-bedroom farmhouse . . . have the use of a woodburning      stove and free-for-the-gathering fuel . . . and have access      to a five-acre pasture to graze our animals in!    </p>    <p>      The vegetables from our garden and fresh-from-the-cow milk      for making butter and cheese keep our larder full at little      cost. In addition, one of the best salmon and trout rivers      in the Northwest borders our new home (I've caught fish      that produced steaks the size of a dinner plate!).    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, as part of the milking deal, our farmer friend      gives us a discount when we purchase day-old calves . . .      so we're slowly building up a dairy herd (for the time when      we can afford our own farm) at very little expense.    </p>    <p>      The swap is good for the dairyman, too, since he gets a      fourth of his farmwork done "free".    </p>    <p>      Now we think that's a pretty darn good MOTHER-type      exchange!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>D.C.</strong></em> <em><strong><br />      Oregon</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Being a "get more for less" enthusiast from way back, I've      always been interested in swapping. But by far the best      opportunity I've had to enjoy my horsetrading hobby      occurred a little more than three years ago . . . when my      wife and I opened a natural foods store.    </p>    <p>      Because we started out on a shoe-string budget, we found      that bartering was essential to get our enterprise up and      running. And rather than hurt our budding business venture      by making folks uneasy (as we, on occasion, had feared it      would), swapping actually helped attract customers! Once      people knew we were willing to trade our wares for items or      services of like value, all kinds of deals were proposed. A      commercial sign painter, for example, designed our outdoor      advertising display in exchange for credit at the shop . .      . and two other barter-bent brush-wielders supplied the      artwork for our catalogs and promotional flyers in return      for nuts, dried fruit, and other organically grown foods.    </p>    <p>      More trades followed: During the summer months we swapped      rice, grains, and dried beans for locally grown prod uce .      . . our part-time help accepted food as payment for their      labor . . . and a share of our store's wares even "bought"      us legal advice! You might say that barter has become the      main means of exchange in this business venture!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>B. B.<br />      New York</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Toward the end of my travels in the United Kingdom, my      funds grew scarce . . . and I realized that the trip would      have to come to a close sooner than I had anticipated. Even      though I wanted to spend more time hiking in the rugged,      breathtaking highlands of northwestern Scotland, I knew      that-as a foreigner-it wouldn't be fair or      legal to compete with the local folk for the already      too-few jobs in that remote region.    </p>    <p>      I noticed, however, that the birch-covered knolls of the      north country harbored a veritable carpet of edible      chanterelle mushrooms (Cantharellus cibarius) . . . a      delicacy that is highly regarded and sought after in      continental Europe, but shunned by many of the local Scot      villagers because of its exotic golden-orange color.    </p>    <p>      So, being something of a wild-food fan, I struck up a      bargain with the local hotel chef (who had neither the time      nor the desire to search the hills for the fungal morsels      .. . but whose clientele were fond of such delicacies). In      return for a steady supply of the succulent mushrooms, he      provided me with ample portions of his leftover fixings      (meals which included salmon, duck, and-of course      homebaked scones).    </p>    <p>      Thanks to our trade, the hotel guests were treated to tasty      mushroom sauces, while I was able to save money on food and      thus extend my vacation!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>T.A.B.<br />      Indiana</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      As an avid angler, I find that I often ac cumulate more      fishing equipment than I can use (it seems I'm forever      testing one type of rod after another to try to locate the      "perfect" bigmouth-bass snagger).    </p>    <p>      So when an acquaintance approached me about a trade a few      years ago, I was glad to swap some of my excess gear for a      12-gauge shotgun.    </p>    <p>      Soon after that "purchase", however. I landed a stimulating      but time-consuming job that afforded me fewer leisure hours      to devote to hunting . . . and the shotgun sat idly in the      back room. In fact, I had just about forgotten about the      weapon when both of the family cars sputtered to a stop . .      . and I learned that $300 worth of repair would be needed      to get them back on the road again.    </p>    <p>      Well, I knew my wallet couldn't foot that bill, so I      decided to try barter. I made a circuit of the local      garages. with the hope of trading my unused firearm for      some auto repair work, and struck it lucky on my second      try: The service station's owner was hankering for just      such a gun . . . and he had recently priced the same model      for over $300!    </p>    <p>      Now the runabouts are both in prime condition again, my      pocket's not a penny poorer, and I've made a new friend!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>J.M.A.</strong></em> <em><strong><br />      Florida</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Not long ago I was stung by the beekeeping bug,      and-after boning up on the basics of      apiculture-was eager to acquire a hive to tend. As I      was discussing the possibility of purchasing a colony from      a neighboring Apis mellifera enthusiast, though, the farmer      mentioned that his barn needed some repairs. That was all      the encouragement I needed! Being in the construction      business, you see, I have a considerable supply of      stockpiled scrap lumber. So, being a not-too-shabby      carpenter (and a bartering fiend at heart), I quickly      proposed a trade: my wood and labor for one of my      beekeeping buddy's inhabited hives.    </p>    <p>      Now-a load of wood, a bag of nails, and a couple of      afternoons later-I'm a proud backyard beekeeper,      eagerly looking forward to that first honey harvest!    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>T. A.<br />      Georgia</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Last autumn, when my husband and I needed to pick up some      supplies from our veterinarian, we found ourselves-upon      arriving at the doctor's office-surrounded by stacks      of old house parts . . . which turned out to be discards      from his latest remodeling project. And, when we discovered      that the medical practitioner was planning to have the      "junk" carted off and burned, we quickly asked whether we      could salvage the usable materials . . . in exchange for      hauling away the entire heap.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, as we started to work on our end of the deal,      we realized that the animal doctor had recently installed a      woodburning heating system . . , but as yet had no supply      of firewood.    </p>    <p>      Well, we had leftover treetops from constructing a log      house, the equipment (and time) needed to cut more timber,      and a $100 vet bill!    </p>    <p>      An even trade was arranged . . . and when we need the doe's      services now, he charges us by the cord!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>M.
