                <p>      <strong>Create your own unique "vintage" of ...</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Susan Asanovic    </h5>        <p>      In just a month or two, apple season will arrive . . . and      if you live in-or plan to visitan area that's      anywhere near a producing orchard, you'll soon have access      to the incomparable taste of freshly pressed apple cider.      Unfortunately, the pure flavor that most folks associate      with unpasteurized juice doesn't linger long unless the      drink is preserved in some way. However, if you can get      your hands on a few gallons of fresh cider this fall, you      could end up with a cellarful of delicious, sparkling      "apple wine" . . . to enjoy all through the coming year.    </p>    <p>      The process of preparing homebrewed champagne cider is      really quite simple . . . and you'll need only a few pieces      of bottling equipment in addition to the "raw material".      Once you've located a nearby source of unpasteurized cider,      gather several gallon wine jugs, a plastic fermentation      lock for each one, a case or two of empty champagne      bottles, about 1-1/2 yards of 1/4" or 1/2" plastic tubing      (or a siphon), a large wooden mallet, and some plastic      champagne corks with wires.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IT'S EASY TO BREW . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      When you purchase cider for "bubbly", try to find some      that's been made from a variety of apples, including tart      crab apples and mellow Delicious. I've found that a blend      of flavors produces an especially full-bodied champagne. I      also think that it's worth waiting for late-season      pressings, because mature apples tend to yield a stronger      beverage.    </p>    <p>      In preparation for your first batch of the sparkling      nectar, it's best to buy only a small amount of juice . ..      say, three gallons. That way, you can reserve one jug for      drinking right away-as sweet, unfermented      cider-and experiment with the other two. Transfer the      fresh juice into clean gallon wine bottles and fit an      airlock cork (see the manufacturer's instructions) snugly      into the neck of each container. This arrangement will      permit the gases produced during fermentation to escape      without allowing outside air to enter . . . making sure      that the natural sugars in the juice will turn into alcohol      and not into vinegar!    </p>    <p>      Place the jugs on a level surface, and let them stand at      room temperature-anywhere from 60 to 70      Â°F-for about a week and a half. After the first      couple of days, you should notice a lot of bubbling action      as COQ is released by the fermenting cider . . . and when      that activity slows to about a bubble a minute, the process      is finished. Remove the airlocks and close each jug with a      solid cork until you're ready to bot tle the newly brewed      potable .    </p>    <p>      <strong>. . . AND BOTTLE . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      To "put up" the champagne, first collect the plastic      tubing, champagne bottles, wires, corks, and mallet . . .      and a few good friends, since half the fun of bottling your      own bubbly is tasting and judging as you go.    </p>    <p>      Now, with the top of a bottle positioned at a lower level      than is the bottom of the gallon jug, insert one end of the      plastic tubing all the way down in the large container . .      . suck a bit of cider through the tube . . . and quickly      place the open end in the champagne bottle. Watch the      process carefully, and when the liquid reaches a level      about four inches from the top, move the tubing to another      champagne bottle . . . and so on, until you've transferred      almost all the cider out of the jug. A gallon of cider      fills four or five champagne bottles. (You may want to save      the last halfinch or so of murky liquid in the bottom of      the jug for use in baking.)    </p>    <p>      Once all the bottles have been filled, the next      step-which should be accomplished as soon as      possible-is to fasten the plastic stoppers in place.      You'll need a sturdy wooden mallet to hammer the corks down      . . . and don't be afraid to tap them firmly into the neck      of the bottle. Put a wire over each stopper and tighten it      by rotating a pencil through the ends until the cork is      securely bound .    </p>    <p>      <strong>. . . AND ENJOY!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Like any fine champagne, your sparkling cider should be      stored in a cool, dark cellar. I like to use regular wine      racks, or crates with inner separations, to prevent the      bottles from breaking. If it's kept long enough, the apple      drink will sometimes undergo a second fermentation,      becoming drier and even more effervescent. No matter how      eager you are, though, wait at least a few weeks before      sampling your brew . . . in order to be sure that it's      fully seasoned.    </p>    <p>      When you can't wait any longer to open a bottle, pry off      its wire, put the container between your knees, and hold      the palm of your hand firmly over the cork while easing it      out with your other hand. Sometimes it may be necessary to      use pliers to remove the stoppers, and you'll probably want      to keep a large bowl handy during the "cork-popping"      operation . . . in case the cider should effervesce a      little too enthusiastically.    </p>    <p>      If you're satisfied with your taste test, the next time you      feel like celebrating you can break out a bottle of your      own champagne cider and drink to your guests with a glass      of refreshing, natural "bubbly". I think you'll agree that      a person doesn't have to be sipping an expensive French      wine to make the familiar toast, a votre sante!    </p>
