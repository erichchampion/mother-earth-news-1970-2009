                		<hr />    <p>      A reader reminds us of a treat our grandmas might have      made.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by     Marilyn H. Hoijer    </h5>        <p>      In my      section of California (and throughout Zones 5 through 8 on      the USDA's plant hardiness map, which can be found on page      180 of this issue), anybody who takes a summer drive down      country roads may see a number of large bushes that will be      loaded-come harvest time-with attractive,      apple-sized, golden fruit. Those delicious-looking globes      are quinces (Cydonia oblonga) and-while they're not      used for much more than an occasional treat for livestock      nowadays-the puckery-when-raw fruits were once the      main ingredient in a mouthwatering array of early American      pies, marmalades, jellies, and jams.</p><p> If you can stake out      an available quince bush while you're on an outing this      summer, that single shrub once its fruit ripens-will      probably provide you with all the fixings you'll need.      Better yet-since most people consider the fruits      inedible-you shouldn't have any trouble obtaining      permission to pick them. Why not get yourself a bucketful      (about 10 pounds), gather together some honey, jars and      paraffin . . . and give my grandmother's quince jam recipe      a try!</p><p> First scrub each fruit to remove its fuzzy coating,      but don't peel off its skin. Then quarter the washed      quinces and push out their seeds <em>without</em> trying to      remove the cores. Put the quince wedges in a large pan and      add enough water to cover the slices by about half an inch.</p><p>      Bring the kettle to a boil and let it simmer until the      fruit becomes soft (this should take between 20 and 30      minutes). Let the pot cool, then drain off the juice and      save it. At this point you can easily remove the sections      of core from each quince slice, and then break the pieces      up-a few at a time-in your blender or food      grinder . . . adding extra water if necessary.</p><p> Once all the      cooked fruit has been "through the mill", return the      "quince sauce" to the pan-along with the juice      drained off earlier-and add honey to taste. (The      sweetness of quinces will vary from year to year or tree to      tree . . . so it's hard to predict exactly how much honey      the recipe will need. I just start with about a third of a      cup of sweetener to each cup of fruit . . . and let my      tastebuds take it from there.)</p><p> Now bring the mixture to a      boil and "let 'er roll" for 10 minutes, stirring      constantly. Then lower the heat to simmer and let the jam      cook for about 10 to 15 minutes (don't stop mixing it!), or      until the sauce takes on a lovely shade of pink. The rosy      color is the signal that your jam is done . . . simply pour      it into sterile glasses and seal your tasty treat for use      during the rest of the year!    </p>
