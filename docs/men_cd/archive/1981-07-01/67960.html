        <p>Nowadays there are so many different types of cutlery that making a wise choice can be quite difficult, but many of the offerings are excellent!</p><p>The inclined plane upon which the knife, and all <em>other</em> bladed cutting implements, is based is about as simple, in concept, as a tool can be. Throughout the years, however, the first crude edged slicing and chopping stones have undergone an evolution of their own . . . and today's prospective knife buyer is faced with a sometimes overwhelming array of choices. In the color photograph that accompanies this article, for example, there are 36 different knives with a total of 60 blades shown, but that sampling doesn't come close to exhausting even the <em>functional</em> variations in such cutting tools. (As a matter of fact, we were surprised to note that, when we borrowed the selection from a local knife shop, the showcases looked almost as full <em>after</em> we removed the three dozen tools as they had <em>before</em>!)</p><p></p><p>As perplexing as this diversity may seem, though, it is possible to isolate a few points that the would-be knifeowner should consider always basing his or her final decision upon the specific demands of the job to be done before making a purchase. These include the composition and related properties of the type of steel used (which are determined by the "ingredients" added to the metal and the heat-treating applied to it), the handle material, the shape of the blade, and the method of connecting the handle to the blade.</p><h3>STEEL</h3><p>The <em>ideal</em> knife steel would be impervious to corrosion, hard enough to hold an edge for years, ductile (that is, flexible rather than brittle) enough not to break when misused, easy to sharpen to a very fine edge, and (of course) readily workable by a manufacturer. Unfortunately, many of these qualities contradict one another . . . so the perfect steel simply doesn't exist. There are, however, a few types that do stand up pretty well to the amazing variety of demands made on knives.</p><p>Steel types are classified according to their chemical makeup, but all the popular, quality knife materials are alloys that contain varying amounts of nickel, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, carbon, silicon, tungsten, vanadium, and other metals. As mentioned above, it's the proportion of each of these components along with the way the blade is heat-treated and tempered that gives a knife steel its individual qualities.</p><p>The two most widely used <em>high-carbon</em> varieties are called O1 and D2. The former contains an unusually large percentage of vanadium, is oil-tempered (that's where the "O" comes from), and is often selected for steel-working implements. When it's used to make knife blades, O1 tends to be a bit on the brittle side and corrodes moderately, but it takes a good edge and holds it tenaciously. D2, on the other hand, is a high-chromium steel (it contains 11.5% chromium, just short of enough to classify a steel as stainless) that's air-tempered. Its properties include excellent ductility and the ability to take a very fine edge. Unfortunately, D2 (the "D" stands for die . . . since diemaking is a common industrial application for the metal) corrodes quickly if not properly cared for.</p><p>By far the most common of the socalled stainless steels (they <em>will</em> oxidize, though more slowly than do other alloys) used for knifemaking is 440C. In fact, it's the most popular of <em>all</em> knife metals . . . because it performs relatively well under a wide variety of conditions. Other materials are better for <em>specific</em> applications, but none equals 440C's overall performance.</p><p>There is, however, another stainless steel, 154CM, that's preferred by some makers of custom knives. It's difficult to obtain and even harder to heat-treat properly . . . but when it's worked well, 154CM can be made very hard without becoming brittle.</p><p>Hardness, as you may know, is usually measured on the Rockwell "C" (RC) scale. An RC number represents a particular steel's resistance to penetration by a diamond weighted with 150 kilograms (330.69 pounds). For general purposes, a knife with a rating of between 57 and 59 RC can be considered a good choice. However, some special-purpose stainless may run as high as 64 RC, while the metal used in cheap knives (which are most definitely <em>not</em> bargains!) may drop below 50 RC.</p><h3>HANDLE MATERIAL</h3><p>Today's age of synthetics has produced a real revolution in knife handles, and in this case the changes should be welcomed. Yesterday's popular leather and wood handles shrank, cracked, absorbed things they shouldn't, and were generally unsatisfactory. Make no mistake . . . sambar stag, Brazilian rosewood, ivory, and the like still set standards for <em>beauty</em>. . . but when it comes to utility, a Johnny-come-lately such as Micarta, or the even newer Du Pont Delrin, is hard to fault.</p><p>Micarta is produced by forcing resins into natural fibers. Paper and linen Micartas (see No. 1 in the accompanying photo for an example) are usually preferred for knives (because of their ivory-like beauty and strength), but canvas and even wood Micartas are not uncommon. (You've more than likely seen the material used in circuit boards or fiber gears.) Micarta stands up quite well to common usage, but for the individual who demands the greatest strength and resistance to chemical deterioration, the new "miracle" substance, Delrin which was developed for the aerospace industry is probably the <em>best</em> choice (see knife No. 21).</p><p>Another aspect of handle selection which deserves examination is weight. Micarta is heavier than are most natural materials, for example, and for applications where light weight is very important (backpacking, for instance), it might be worth considering a tang-handied (No. 23) or an aluminum-gripped (Nos. 16 and 20) knife. In general, however, the <em>balance</em> provided by the handle is more important than its overall heft.</p><p>One final precaution: Make sure that any natural handle is well sealed (with anhydrous lanolin, for instance). Porous materials can absorb organic matter and provide a breeding ground for micro-organisms. More than one case of recurring diarrhea has been attributed to a poorly sealed and improperly cleaned knife handle.</p><h3>BLADE SHAPE</h3><p>Knife blade form is (and just about always has been) determined by a combination of function and visual appeal. Hence a great variety of blade shapes have been developed, to perform what is actually a relatively narrow set of duties. For example, would you have guessed that (when the tools are classified strictly by function) there are only <em>three</em> kinds of kitchen knives?</p><p>A chopping knife (such as No. 10) rocks against a cutting board, so it's usually built with a wide blade (to provide clearance between the board and the user's fingers) and a thick spine (so that the butt of the hand can be pressed against it). The common paring knife (No. 11) is-in design-just a smaller version of a chopping knife . . . though it's often used for other tasks as well.</p><p>A slicing knife (No. 13), however, must pass cleanly <em>through</em> the material it cuts. Therefore, the blade is comparatively narrow and thin to offer as little friction as possible.</p><p>The third kind of kitchen utensil-the serrated bread cutter (No. 12)-is actually more similar to a saw than to a true knife. There are a few other knives that employ serrations along their <em>backs</em> to cut rope (No. 19), but the applications of such teeth are rather limited.</p><p>Though most knife blades (kitchen or otherwise) could probably be described in terms of one or more of these three basic functions, their <em>names</em> are based upon a number of different factors. The shapes are often denoted by referring to the point's location in relation to the spine. <em>Drop, flat,</em> and <em>trailing tip</em> blades are pretty much self-explanatory. A clip point is a derivative of a flat or drop point: A concave section has been removed from the back of the knife to lower the point. (If the clip is sharpened, it's often called a <em>swedge.</em> )</p><p>Blades are also referred to by their function and by the names of their creators (as is the case with No. 15, a bowie knife). Of course, the manner in which some of these are used has changed during the years. The penknife, for example (look at the left-pointing blade of No. 35), was designed to sharpen writing quills. Needless to say, few penknives-which constitute many of the blades mounted in American pocketknives-ever serve their original purpose nowadays.</p><p>Unless you're in the market for a special purpose knife-such as an electrician's (No. 36), sailor's, with marline-spike (No. 26), woodcarving (No. 25), or survival (Nos. 16 and 18) knife, to name a few you needn't worry too much about your choice of blade shape. Most knives get used for <em>many</em> different tasks, and a general-purpose design can handle almost all such jobs quite well.</p><h3>FOLDING VS. LOCKING VS. FIXED</h3><p>Deciding on a type of blade-to-handle connection is probably more important (and definitely less imposing) when buying a knife than is choosing blade design. Folding knives, of course, can accommodate a wide variety of useful blades . . . but such implements shouldn't be employed in any situation where much pressure is applied to the tool. A blade that folds at the wrong time can do serious damage.</p><p>Lockback knives are actually made in two different configurations. Some multibladed varieties are equipped with a tab that slips in front of the hilt when the blade is opened. Such an arrangement is helpful, but it doesn't provide a joint as secure as that offered by a <em>true</em> locking knife . . . which engages a single blade firmly within the pivot mechanism.</p><p>Though locking-blade knives have-to some extent-become more popular than the fixed variety in recent years (both because of quality improvements in the folding tools and because they look quite a bit less ominous when hanging from a belt), there are still many good reasons for owning a rigid sheath knife. When used for messy tasks (as any hunting or fishing knife often is) a locking blade's mechanism can become fouled, and will be quite difficult to clean. What's more, folding and locking knives rarely have handles that fit the hand as well as do those of fixed-blade implements. Finally, although knives should never be used as crowbars, any sideways pressure can quickly weaken the joint in a tool with a pivot between its handle and blade.</p><h3><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">FROM SHEFFIELD TO SEKI</a></h3><p>The art of producing quality cutlery seems to be reemerging . . . after a modern day bout with mass production that flooded much of the market with junk. Custom knives (see the accompanying story about Bob Parrish) are gaining popularity, as the public comes to recognize the value of quality, handmade items. Competition is also playing an important role in improving commercially made knives. The Japanese cutlery industry (based in Seki) is now producing very fine tools, and has provided the impetus for the established Western makers (in the U.S.A., in Sheffield, England, and in Solingen, Germany) to constantly improve <em>their</em> products.</p><p>In short, the general availability of quality knives is one example of what technology <em>can</em> do to aid us all. If only a similar respect for craft and practicality could infect other industries as well!</p><h3>T<a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">HE EST OF SING CUSTOM KNIVES</a></h3><p>Bob Parrish is the proprietor of a shop named RP Knives that's located in MOTHER's hometown. Besides being the individual kind enough (and <em>trusting</em> enough) to lend us several thousand dollars' worth of his inventory for photographs, Bob is a custom knife craftsman . . . and he allowed us to slip into his workshop and take a peek at (and a photo or two of) some of the painstaking steps that go into the production of an RP custom knife.</p><p>The artisan told us that the major differences between custom and commercial knives-other than the customer's freedom to influence the design-are that only one person (a very <em>skilled</em> one) works on each of the handmade tools from start to finish, and that a number of very time-consuming steps go into preparing the product.</p><p>For example, Bob begins forming the edge of one of his creations with a 36-grit disk. He then proceeds with a 140-grit wheel, and follows up with 240 paper backed by a file. At that point, the knife is heat-treated (it's first wrapped in stainless toil for protection), and the craftsman returns to 240 paper to remove any imperfections. Next on the list come 320- and 400-grit papers. Finally, to bring the blade to a mirror finish, the steel is buffed on wheels with 500-grit, 800-grit, and 1,000-grit compounds in succession. All told, more than 100 steps go into the making of an RP knife. . . and the results speak for themselves.</p><p>Custom knives are rapidly becoming valued collector's items . . . and many can command prices of well over $1,000. But a very fine knife offers more than aesthetic and investment advantages. You might be surprised to learn, for example, that a mirror-polished blade may, because of the smooth finish given to the metal have only <em>one-fifth</em> the surface area of a less-polished commercial knife of the same dimensions, and-as a consequence-is much more resistant to corrosion.</p><p>EDITOR'S NOTE: For information on RP custom cutlery, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to RP Knives, Dept.
