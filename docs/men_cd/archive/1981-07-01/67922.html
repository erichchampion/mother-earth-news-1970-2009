                <p>      This elegant outdoor feast is downright delicious and a      snap to prepare!    </p>            <p>      One of the nicest things about summer is the chance to get      the family together-between bouts of gardening and      putting up produce-for occasional picnics and      cookouts. It's easy, however, when planning the menu for an      outdoor dinner, to stick (by force of habit) with such      familiar favorites as fried chicken, charcoal-broiled      steak, deviled eggs, potato salad, and cole slaw. Now as      popular as the old standards may be, it's often fun to      surprise your relatives and friends with a few unexpected      gourmet dishes . . . or even with a whole menu of "special"      delectables.    </p>    <p>      When MOM's staff set off in search of a unique, delicious,      and nutritious meal for a summer cookout, we turned to our      old friend Deborah Dunn, of the Herb Garden Cafe in      MOTHER's home base of Hendersonville, North Carolina. (See      "Four Fantastic Vegetarian Sandwiches From the Herb Garden      Cafe . . . With Love" in MOTHER NO. 52. )    </p>    <p>      And Deborah, with her usual flair, produced a mouthwatering      feast that consists of baked trout, stuffed tomatoes,      marinated mushrooms, and brandied peaches. Better still      (considering how busy summer can be), it's a meal      that-except for the fish, which is tastiest when      caught fresh from a mountain stream-can be prepared      in advance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A RECIPE SCHEDULE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Start your woodland banquet for four, during the evening      prior to the excursion, by mixing 1 pound of sliced fresh      mushrooms, 2 teaspoons of tamari (soy sauce), 3 chopped      cloves of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, 2 tablespoons of      minced fresh parsley, 1/4 cup of water, the juice of 2      lemons, 1/2 cup of olive oil, and 1/2 cup of safflower oil.      Let the dish marinate in the refrigerator overnight.    </p>    <p>      The next day-a few hours prior to the cookoutslice up      6 fresh, ripe peaches and combine them with 1/2 cup of      honey, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons of      brandy. Refrigerate the dessert and let the various flavors      mingle until you're ready to serve it.    </p>    <p>      When chowtime is approximately an hour away, fire up your      charcoal grill. Now, wash 6 large tomatoes (to allow      seconds for the hungriest diners) and place them in boiling      water for 1 minute. Then drain them, drop the fruits into      cold water, and carefully remove their skins. With that      done, slice each tomato (keep the stem side up) into four      wedges, cutting almost to-and not through-the      bottom. Spread the sections slightly apart sprinkle the      inner surfaces with a bit of salt . . . cover the tomatoes      . . . and place them in a cooler.    </p>    <p>      For the filling, dice 1/2 of a cucumber, 1/2 of a green      pepper, 2 stalks of celery, 3 scallions, and 1 bunch of      fresh parsley. Then add 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1/7 teaspoon      of cayenne, 1 teaspoon of basil, 1/8 teaspoon of granulated      garlic, and 2 cups of cottage cheese. When you're ready to      eat, spoon the mixture into the tomato shells, and top them      with black olives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE MAIN COURSE</strong>    </p>    <p>      By this time, Deborah assumes that you have caught ( or      bought, if the fish aren't biting) 4 trout . . . each about      11 to 14 inches in length. Once the trout are cleaned,      place four lemon wedges (or try orange wedges for a      deliciously different flavor) in the cavity of each fish.      Sprinkle the inside with fresh parsley and curry powder,      season the trout-both inside and out-with salt      and pepper, and coat them generously with butter.    </p>    <p>      Wrap the fish individually in heavy-duty aluminum foil      and-once the charcoal fire has burned down-set      them on the grill to cook for about 5 minutes on each side,      or until the meat flakes easily Serve with more lemon      wedges.    </p>    <p>      This fishbake-in-the-forest (or wherever you choose to      enjoy it) is sure to turn a casual summer picnic into      culinary event that you'll remember for long time to come.    </p>
