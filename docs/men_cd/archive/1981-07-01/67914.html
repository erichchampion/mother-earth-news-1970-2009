            		  <p>      There's good money to be made in tearing down old buildings      and selling reusable materials.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Phillip Foster    </h5>		 		  <p>      A few years ago-acting pretty much on impulse-I      made a deal with the owner of a small condemned house,      offering to clear his lot if I could keep the materials to      use in a home remodeling project. However, as I tore the      old place apart, a number of people stopped and asked to      buy the various boards and fixtures. Soon all the salvage      from that structure was sold . .. and I decided to try to      find another demolition job. After all, I still needed      materials myself . . . I enjoyed the work . . . and I saw      an opportunity to bring in additional cash.    </p>    <p>      It soon became apparent that many landowners and      construction companies were delighted at the chance to pay      me to dismantle their buildings, in order to avoid the      usually high prices charged by conventional demolition      crews. In fact, on the fourth house I took down, I cleared      $325 plus the profit from salvage sales . . . and I knew I      wanted to stay in the business. Maybe you'd like to try it      too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRELIMINARY PREPARATIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before I could call myself a professional dismantler,      though, I had to rent a storage yard and garage . . . the      upstairs of which I converted into a small apartment.      (Since a young operation will usually be small, and because      the inventory sells so quickly, a 30' X 30' storage area is      plenty large. However, you will need room to clean and sort      your wares, so the more interior space you have, the      better.)    </p>    <p>      I did my hauling with a small pickup truck and trailer for      my first two jobs, but soon bought an old (1941) 2-1/2-ton      vehicle with a 14-foot flatbed. My tool inventory consists      of a couple of crowbars, a steelshanked hammer, assorted      screwdrivers, wire and tin cutters, a small bow saw, a pipe      wrench, a magnet (to pick up nails), and a couple of      brushes and scraping tools. It's best not to rely on heavy      equipment, but rather to work with small tools in order to      remove old boards and dismantle fixtures with a minimum of      damage.    </p>    <p>      I discovered at once that good, sturdy work clothes were      necessary, too. Before you do any demolition work, be sure      to buy some strong, steel-toed shoes with thick soles . . .      since you'll often be walking around (and on) nails and      shattered glass. Likewise, heavy leather gloves and a      helmet will shield your hands and head, and coveralls will      both protect your clothing and provide lots of pocket      space.    </p>    <p>      It was also necessary for me to obtain a contractor's      license . . . but that wasn't unduly difficult. The      required qualifications vary from one locality to another,      but most cities and counties demand that an applicant have      liability insurance (I needed $250,000 worth,      which-at that time-cost me $50 a year) and a      surety bond (I paid a bonding agency about $150 for a      $2,000 bond). Once those items were taken care of, the fee      for the contractor's permit itself came to about $50 a      year.    </p>    <p>      To announce my services to the community, I had some      posters and business cards printed, and nailed up a      homemade sign on my garage door. Such advertising serves      chiefly to attract customers for the salvaged materials,      however . . . I have to find the dismantling jobs on my      own.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A HOUSE SCOUT</strong>    </p>    <p>      It's relatively easy to locate homes in need of demolition.      Just drive around and look for abandoned and condemned      buildings, and-after you spot one that looks empty      and ready for destruction-check the city or county      tax records to find the owner. I've discovered that many      people are glad to pay me for dismantling ... since I ask      about one-quarter of the price that big companies charge      (although the "pros" will take down a house in a couple of      days as opposed to the several weeks I generally need).    </p>    <p>      I also sometimes find work by checking the local or      regional contractor's publications for upcoming jobs that      will require the removal of any structures. The builders      are often glad to save on demolition costs by hiring me.    </p>    <p>      The contract for my dismantling jobs is pretty simple and      straightforward. I ask about $500 to tear down a      medium-sized house, and guarantee that the job will be done      in 21 days. A written contract should also specify whether      the foundation and trees on the property are to be removed.      Furthermore, I generally offer a 7% discount if the      customer pays one-third of the contract price in advance.      (I don't miss the percentage much, since the money to be      made in house removal is usually insignificant compared to      my income from salvage sales.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, for each job, the city or county government will      probably require a demolition permit costing a few dollars.      You're eligible to buy these once you have a contractor's      permit . . . but you can ask each property owner to provide      it for you, if you prefer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ART OF DECONSTRUCTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      I learned the art of deconstruction by reading a few early      twentieth century carpentry manuals to see how old houses      were put together. It was then fairly simple to develop a      systematic process for taking them down.    </p>    <p>      The first step is to remove all furniture and loose      materials from the structure's interior . . . then take out      all window glass and exposed electrical and plumbing      fixtures. (The latter items can usually be unscrewed and      lifted off, or-in some cases-pried out.)    </p>    <p>      If there's a chimney, it should be dismantled to the roof      line at this point. The bricks are often easily lifted off      by hand, but it's a good idea to use care when doing so,      since those that are in good condition can be      sold-after the mortar is cleaned off-for 10 to      18 cents apiece.    </p>    <p>      Once that's done, the interior finished wood (floors and      molding) should be pried loose gently with a crowbar, in      order to cause as little damage to it as possible.      Next-working just as carefully-take down the      interior walls. (When removing any lumber, simply figure      out the order in which the boards were put together and      then reverse it. It's also a good idea to haul all      materials away to the salvage yard as you go along, to make      sure you don't accumulate an unsightly, and dangerous, pile      of junk at the work site.) After the interior walls are      out, the roof shingles can be torn off rather quickly,      because they generally aren't worth saving.    </p>    <p>      The next step is to remove the horizon tal roof boards      (again, using a crowbar) and then take off the roof      skeleton piece by piece. Sometimes the ceiling headers (the      structural beams that join the exterior walls at the top)      have to come off with the roof, but-unless those      members are integrally connected with the roof      board-sit's best to leave them on to hold the walls      in place while you dismantle the rest of the house.    </p>    <p>      When the roof skeleton is gone, carefully crowbar the      exterior walls away. Then you can take down the rest of the      chimney, tossing the bricks out between the joists onto      grass or soft ground to avoid damaging them.    </p>    <p>      The rest of the deconstruction process is quite clear-cut:      Dismantle the ceiling headers, push out the wall joists,      remove the structural subfloor, lift and haul away the      floor beams . . . and the building will be gone!    </p>    <p>      If the foundation has to be removed, dig it up with a      rented backhoe and truck the material to the dump. The      rubble can be salvaged for use as filler in new cement      projects, but few people like to use it . . . so the job is      usually little more than extra work. I avoid including      foundation removal in my contracts whenever I can.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CLEAN UP FOR CASH!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once the owner is satisfied with the clearing of the site,      the materials you've collected must be cleaned and sorted.      Pull the nails out of all the wood, then organize the      lumber according to size ... grouping dimensional boards in      separate piles of 2 X 4's, 2 X 6's, 2 X 12's, etc., and      making other stacks of different sizes of plywood.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to gather up all nails and other "junk" metal, too,      since scrap dealers will purchase such material for $1.00      to $1.50 per hundred pounds. Furthermore, if you scrape the      insulation off any electrical wires that you accumulate,      you can sell the copper . . . for 45 to 60 cents a pound.    </p>    <p>      The point is to clean up and save everything usable. For      example, any plumbing and electrical fixtures in decent      working order (or in at least fixable condition) can be      sold . . . and some people even like to turn otherwise      useless pipes into tables or bookshelves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY SALVAGE SELLS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Today's demand for salvage is high, primarily because      building materials used in pre-World War II houses      are-in most cases-of higher quality than those      available now. Yesterday's boards came from old-growth      timber stands, and were dried in lumberyards for as long as      two or three years before being sold. From the early 1940's      on, though, processed planks have been kiln-dried, and are      planed to smooth out the knots that are more prevalent in      new-growth timber.    </p>    <p>      Consequently, 2 X 4's are now actually only about 1-1/2" X      3-1/2" in size ... and when lumber is purchased in      quantity, such shrinkage can add up to quite a loss of      structural mass! (The difference in dimensions must, of      course, be taken into account when planning any project      using older wood.) On top of that, many builders consider      rough-hewn or weathered boards particularly attractive . .      . and people who want to remodel the interiors of their old      houses find that salvaged material matches the existing      wood much better than does new lumber. Older plumbing and      electrical fixtures, too, are often of better quality than      are new ones. Toilet seats, for example, were formerly made      of wood or porcelain instead of plastic.    </p>    <p>      Finally, salvage is much less expensive than new material.      I charge 10d to 25 cents a board foot for old air-dried      planks . . . and the demand for them is so high that I      could sell ten times as many as I have available.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SALVAGE STORE MANAGEMENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      When working in the salvage store, I find it both easy and      fun to help people design a project around the material I      have on hand . . . and I'd like more oppor tunity to tackle      that part of my business. However, in order to have time to      do the deconstruction work and clean the resulting salvage,      I hire daytime sales help, and can tend the place myself      only in the late afternoons and early evenings.    </p>    <p>      Because I want to keep my pricing very fair, I charge no      more than 50% of the cost of similar new materials. Actual      fees depend on both the condition of the salvage and the      quantity purchased. Standard bathroom sinks, as an example,      bring $10 to $15, and light fixtures start at $1.00.    </p>    <p>      My business has been in full operation for a year and a      half now, and grosses $3,000 to $4,000 a month. Of course,      my monthly expenses vary. If I need assistance to tear down      a building, for instance, I pay my temporary help on a      piecework basis, using an agreed-upon figure per      1,000 board feet of lumber removed. Then there's the cost      of tool and truck maintenance, clothing, garage rental,      utilities, salespeople's wages, insurance, bonding, and      licensing fees.    </p>    <p>      And of course the more money I bring in, the more business      improvements I intend to make . . . including putting a      couple of big, sturdy signs on my store, and advertising in      the local Yellow Pages under three headings: "Building      Materials", "Salvage", and "Demolition".    </p>    <p>      But even though both my expenses and my profits are      irregular at this point, my income has been more than      adequate. And, most important, I'm self-employed and doing      ecologically sound work that I really enjoy!    </p>
