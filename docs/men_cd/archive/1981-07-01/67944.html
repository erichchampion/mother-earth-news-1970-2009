        <h5>Issue # 70 - July/August 1981</h5><p>As part of MOTHER's continuing effort to help her readers recycle "junk" into moneysaving useful items, we offer you . . .</p><h5 id="byline">by E. Maurice Stack</h5><p>Remember that old broken-down washer that you've been intending to take to the dump? Well, be glad you've procrastinated, because the appliance's sturdy frame can provide you with a fine tool stand for your workshop.</p><p>And, even if you don't <em>have</em> such an "heirloom" hanging around the house, you can usually pick up a worn-out machine for little or nothing (most folks will be glad to have you haul the old clothes-cleaners away).</p><p>Furthermore, the transformation from appliance to tool-operating table isn't difficult to accomplish. First remove the washer's inner mechanism, the top console, and the lid . . . then simply trim a piece of 3/4" plywood to fit the surface . . . and drill and bolt it on to suit your needs. (Before mounting your power tool, though, clean and lubricate the washer's self-leveling legs so they'll work smoothly.)</p><p>You'll find that this handy addition to your workshop is neat and lightweight enough to be moved easily, yet sturdy enough to handle even a <em>heavy</em> tool. Moreover, your "new" tool stand will-with the addition of a homemade wooden shelf or two-provide you with extra storage space . . . and that's a commodity that no handyperson can ever have too much of!</p><hr /><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For more tips on how you can recycle a wornout washing machine, turn to the article on page 116.</em></p>
