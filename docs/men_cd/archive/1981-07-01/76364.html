    <p>
                    <p>      <strong>CREMATORIUM COGENERATION?</strong> A      5,000-square-foot funeral home in Corvallis, Oregon is      being heated by a $30,000 system that reclaims waste heat      from the complex's natural gas-fired crematory. The setup      permitted the mortuary's owners to take advantage of      Oregon's alternative energy tax credits.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SLOWPOKE ISN'T A LAZY HORSE:</strong> The Atomic      Energy Commission of Canada has developed a nuclear      reactor-dubbed "Slowpoke"-that's purported to      be the least expensive and smallest unit ever designed for      commercial use. Researchers say the $850,000 mini-reactor      can generate two megawatts of power . . . and claim that      the plant is safe enough to replace conventional furnaces      in the basements of large hotels.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT ABOUT BLACK CAR SEATS?</strong> A patent has      been granted for "Solatorus" . . . a solar collector made      out of discarded automobile tires. The inventor of the      device says that two of the units have successfully heated      homes in Orange County, New York during the past two      winters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A CORPORATE BREAKTHROUGH?</strong> Southern      California Edison recently amended previous statements to      say that more than 30% of its additional generation needs      will derive from "renewable and alternate sources" by 1990.      In the past, the company had maintained that only about 10%      of its energy could come from wind, solar, or geothermal      power by the end of the century. Energy analysts likened      the utility's announcement to "Richard Nixon recognizing      China".    </p>    <p>      <strong>POWER (AND PROFIT) TO THE PEOPLE:</strong> When      Haines, Oregon faced a 32% electrical power rate increase      that the town's budget simply couldn't absorb, city      officials started investigating the feasibility of      installing a municipal hydropower facility on a nearby      stream. The potential is so promising that Haines (with a      population of 355) may float a bond issue to build a      hydroplant capable of generating $4 million worth of      electricity each year. If it does so, the town will be able      to pocket an estimated $1.5 million annually . . . by      selling the surplus juice.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AND WHAT'S MORE</strong> <strong>,</strong>      Oregonians aren't the only folks joining the return to      hydropower (a source of energy, by the way, that was      supposedly made "obsolete" by massive federal projects      years ago). The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission      reports that the number of applications for permits and      licenses to study, build, or expand hydroplants climbed      from 294 in 1975 to 8,300 in 1980 . . . a 2,700% increase.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A DRY WELL?</strong> Political factors and      technical hurdles could cause world oil production to drop      by more than 20% by the year 2000, according to a recent      federal study. The report forecasts a total daily      production of about 50 million barrels . . . which      represents a decline of 12 million barrels from current      figures.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUT IT'S NOT ORGANIC:</strong> In recent public      service ads, Mobil Oil Company attributes a 240% increase      in American corn yields to the availability of diesel fuel      for farm machinery and petrochemicals to kill weeds and      pests. "Sure beats the era of the horse and natural      fertilizers," Mobil comments. The ad also states that 50      tons of manure would be required to supply the nitrogen      contained in half a ton of ammonia fertilizer. "How's that      for reducing air pollution?" Mobil asks. It's enough to      make one wonder whether the oil company even understands      the problem!    </p>    <p>      <strong>UPDATE ON SOLAR RADIO:</strong> WBNO, a      500-watt radio station in cloudy Bryan, Ohio that      switched from conventional to solar energy in 1979 (see      MOTHER NO. 63, page 170) is functioning better than ever:      The photovoltaic installation was expected to provide 80%      of the facility's needs, but is producing 90%. WHO OWNS THE      WIND? Commercial investors are moving aggressively to      capture a share of the burgeoning windpower market. Large      manufacturers-such as Bendix, Alcoa, and      Boeing-are turning out windplants . . . and an      estimated 91 utilities nationwide have windpower projects      in the works.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TREE POWER:</strong> A 260-page study, Tree Crops      for Energy Co-Production on Farms , explores the energy      potential of such trees as mesquite, honey locust,      persimmon, Chinese tallow, and other varieties suitable for      cultivation on marginal land. A limited number of copies of      the report are available (at $10.75 each) from Tom Milne,      SERI, Dept. TMEN, Public Information Office, 1536 Cole      Boulevard, Golden, Colorado 80401.    </p>    <p>      Southern California Edison-spurred by the success of      Israeli researchers-is building an      <strong>EXPERIMENTAL SOLAR POND</strong> at Salton Sea      which, it's predicted, will be capable of generating five      megawatts of electricity .... MORE THAN 6,800      <strong>AMERICANS NOW HAVE LICENSED STILLS</strong> to      produce ethanol, as compared to 800 just five years ago,      according to the National Alcohol Fuels Information Center      .... Alcoa's <strong>139-FOOT-TALL EXPERIMENTAL WINDMILL      COLLAPSED</strong> during tests in Palm Springs, California      when a malfunctioning motor caused a blade to slice through      a support wire .... <strong>FEDERAL INCENTIVES FOR      CONVENTIONAL AND NUCLEAR ENERGY PRODUCTION</strong>      tostaled $252 billion between 1921 and 1978, while only $5      billion has been spent for solar energy development to date      .... This summer, Paul MacCready's <strong>SOLAR      CHALLENGER</strong> -a photovoltaic-powered      aircraft-will attempt its longest flight yet: an excursion      from Paris to London. (Look for an interview with      MacCready, the designer of both the Solar Challenger and      the pedalpowered Gossamer Albatross, in MOTHER NO. 71!)    </p>
