Byers    </h5>    <p>      You can get <em>affordable</em> electricity (and achieve independence) with sunbeams . . . today!    </p>				<p>    A short while ago, most North Americans thought solar energy    too exotic to be put to any <em>practical</em> use . . . but    in the past few years our worsening energy situation has    changed the picture considerably. Sun power is now becoming a    standard means of heating homes and domestic water . . . and    its popularity is no doubt due-at least in    part-to the feelings of self-sufficiency and wellbeing    that an "independent" energy source can provide. In fact,    harnessing the sun has become so widely accepted that a    number of regional governments (California's San Diego    County, for example) now <em>require</em> that solar features    be incorporated in all new construction.</p><p> However, when    someone mentions producing <em>electricity</em> from    sunlight, most of us are probably still inclined to be    skeptical . . . assuming that photovoltaic setups are better    left to the latest Buck Rogers episodes. "Not so!" I say.    Because, for many people, practical solar electric power is    here today . . . and at affordable prices! And how, you may    ask, do I know? Well, for one thing, a bank of solar cells    provides <em>all</em> the electricity used in my family's    home!	</p>	    <h3>      HOW IT'S DONE    </h3>	<p>			Changing sunlight (photons) into electricity    (electrons)-the process called photovoltaic    conversion-was pioneered by Bell Laboratories in the    mid-fifties. And the silicon solar cells that Bell first    devel oped for the space program are still the workhorses of    the industry.</p><p> The cells are sliced from a cylinder of    ultrapure silicon crystal . . . which is nothing more than (    <em>highly</em> ) refined sand. Every wafer is then    chemically treated and processed to form a semiconductor    junction (the technique is similar to that used in the    fabrication of common transistors). It's within this thin    semiconductor junction that electricity is generated.</p><p> And    just how is the power produced? Well, photons strike the    junction, liberating electrons (the action involves a    mechanism that can be fully explained only by an excursion    into quantum physics that I'd rather not make). The freed    electrons are then collected by a conductive grid placed over    the face of the cell. When a wire is connected from the front    grid to the back of the cell, current flows.</p><p> Each cell    generates about 1/2 volt of DC electricity, while the amount    of current (amperage) depends upon the number of free    electrons-which is proportional to light    intensity-and the size of the cell.</p><p> Since each unit is    capable of producing only about 1/2 volt, the cells must be    connected in a series circuit in order to increase the    voltage to a useful level. (The procedure is similar to    stacking flashlight batteries.) Hence, 24 cells will, in    theory, give a total output of 12 volts. In actual practice,    however, each cell's output is closer to 0.46 volt, so 26    cells are required to produce a full 12 volts. And, though    amperage varies from manufacturer to manufacturer (depending    on the efficiency and size of the cells), a typical 12-volt    panel might produce 2 amperes.</p><p> If left <em>unprotected</em> ,    silicon photovoltaic cells would be susceptible to damage    from moisture and airborne contaminants. So, after they're    wired together, the wafers are laid face down on a sheet of    safety glass. A piece of plastic (such as Mylar) is then    stretched across the back of the assembly and heat-bonded.    Last of all, the 3/8"-thick panel is crimped into a metal    frame. . . both to protect the glass and to help conduct heat    away from the cells. A perfect seal is then insured by    applying a liberal bead of silicone sealant along the joined    edges.		</p>    <h3>      DOLLARS PER WATT		</h3>	   <p>		With the background information pretty much taken care    of, let's examine a couple of the practical aspects of solar    electricity: the <em>size</em> and <em>type</em> of setup you    might consider installing. And, since most folks will allow    cost to determine just how far they go in developing a    photovoltaic system, let's start by talking dollars and     cents.</p><p> Currently, the market prices for panels vary from $10    to $20 per watt of capacity .. . that is, a 30-watt panel    would cost between $300 and $600. But remember . . . that's    for prime, first-quality collectors.</p><p> There are ways,    fortunately, to purchase panels for less money. One    possibility is to buy surplus equipment. Because the    photovoltaic industry is expanding so rapidly, today's top    seller may be replaced by an improved version at any time,    and the obsolete units often sell for less than $10 per watt.    Look for existing photovoltaic systems that are being    updated-the Department of Energy has a few scattered    throughout the country-or check directly with    manufacturers to find out whether they have any unsold    obsolete panels in stock.</p><p> "Manufacturer's seconds" (any    panels whose performance isn't up to one or more of the    maker's specifications) can also be bought at reduced prices.    The most frequently found defect in such units is the    production of a lower current output than was expected . . .    although in rare cases a defective cell may reduce panel    voltage, too. You might even be able-if you can do    business with a vendor who has a government contract-to    acquire panels that have been rejected merely for cosmetic    reasons (such as discoloring or blemishes), which in no way    affect the performance of the units!</p><p> If you shop prudently,    you can probably find imperfect collectors for as little as    $5.00 per watt. And, if you are able and <em>qualified</em>    to inspect them before you lay your money down (or know    someone else who is), seconds may prove to be the best way to    start a home photovoltaic setup. But be forewarned . . . the    increased interest in solar electricity is rapidly drying up    the surplus-and-seconds market. Therefore, bargains are    getting harder and harder to come by . . . and you'll have to    do your homework.</p><p> There is, however, still one more way to    save on the cost of solar cells: quantity buying. Because    manufacturing expense drops dramatically with increased    production, companies are usually willing to give a    significant discount on large orders. As a matter of fact, as    much as 50% can be lopped off the sticker price when groups    of homeowners buy cooperatively.</p><p> But, you may want to know,    why would someone opt to use solar electricity in the first    place? Even at $10 per watt, a photovoltaic system can hardly    compete with readily available utility power. (Of course,    folks who are facing steep installation charges for long    service entrance wires may find that solar cells are    <em>already</em> a bargain.) But consider for a moment: Oil    prices have been rising and will certainly continue to do so    . . . and over two-thirds of the electrical generation    capacity in the United States is petroleum fueled.    Photovoltaic cells, on the other hand-while subject to    short-term price fluctuations-are generally becoming    <em>less</em> expensive. Many experts think that the costs    associated with the two systems will be equal before the turn    of the century . .. some even believe that the prices will    balance out within five years.</p><p> My point is that    <em>today</em> is a good time to begin building the    groundwork for your home photovoltaic system . .. by setting    up a <em>small</em> powerplant that can be expanded as panels    become less expensive.		</p>    <h3>      PRACTICAL PHOTOVOLTAICS		</h3>	  <p>	  A basic solar-electric system consists of nothing more    than a photovoltaic collector and a load. Such arrangements    are commonly employed to pump water in remote areas. By    referring to Fig. 1, you'll notice that the wires from the    solar panel connect directly to the motor. When sunlight    strikes the collector, it generates electricity . . . which    in turn powers the pump. Now to get acceptable performance    and reliability out of such a setup, it's important to be    sure that the pump motor is compatible with the panel's    output. The voltage must be the same, and the collector must    be capable of supplying enough current to match the pump's    rated capacity. However, in order to make such comparisons,    you'll have to know just how the demand and the output are    related.</p><p> Photovoltaic panels are, for technical purposes,    rated in volt/amps rather than watts. One volt at 1 amp    equals 1 volt/amp . . . consequently, 12 volts at 1 amp will    work out to 12 volt/amps. Of course, the motor used in a    pumping system may be rated in watts, but it should also have    separate voltage and amperage ratings.</p><p> Let's say that we want    to use a motor that has a listed capacity of 12 volts at 5    amps. First, keep in mind that most commercial panels are    standardized at 12 volts, so the voltage will likely match.    Next, let's assume that we have a 2-amp panel, which results    in a collector with a 24volt/amp rating (12 volts times 2    amps equals 24-volt/amps). The requirement of the motor is 60    volt/amps (12 volts times 5 amps). Thus we'll need three    panels hooked in <em>parallel</em> , as shown in Fig. 2, to    operate our pump properly. And obviously, in order to expand    this system, we need only add more panels in parallel to    achieve any current level necessary for a specific job.	</p>		<h3>    HIGH-VOLTAGE SYSTEMS	</h3>	<p>	    Thus far we've discussed only 12-volt systems, and you're    probably wondering whether a low-voltage collector can be    practical. Well, there <em>are</em> numerous devices that    operate on 12 volts-auto radios and stereos, small    motors, and recreational-vehicle refrigerators are just a few    examples-but there are also a number of appliances that    just won't work at such a limited potential.</p><p> However, the    <em>voltage</em> of a photovoltaic system can be increased by    connecting panels in series, as shown in Fig. 3. You must    remember, though, that amperage will seek the level of the    weakest panel in the group. Therefore, if you hook a 1-amp    and a 2-amp panel In series, the resultant amperage will be    only I . . . but if two panels of 2-amp rating are hooked in    series, the output will be 2 amps.</p><p> Obviously, connecting    panels in series can make solar electricity much more    versatile than can a simple parallel setup. There's a great    deal of 24-volt, 36-volt, and 48-volt equipment available.    Furthermore, if you hook nine panels in series, you'll have a    110-volt DC unit . . . and many common 110volt AC appliances    will operate on DC current (small hand tools, kitchen    gadgets, heating elements, light bulbs, and radios and    televisions that specifically claim AC/DC; compatibility).</p><p> In    addition, <em>groups</em> of series collectors can be wired    in parallel . . . as long as they're stacked <em>in    increments</em> <em>of the total voltage</em> . Notice, in    Fig. 4, that three panels at a time must be added to a    36-volt system . . . no more, no less!	</p>	    <h3>      SAVING FOR A RAINY DAY    </h3>	<p>			But-most would-be photovoltaic purchasers    ask-what happens when the sun doesn't come out? Well,    believe it or not, solar-electric collectors do produce power    on cloudy days . . . but at only about 50% of their "normal"    rate. And, of course, the semiconductors take a well-earned    rest each evening. Consequently, while a power storage system    isn't absolutely necessary, it certainly can be useful.</p><p> There    are numerous ways of storing electricity, but the lead/acid    battery is the least expensive and most widely available.    And, although we've referred to panel output as 12 volts up    to this point for the sake of convenience, nearly all    manufacturers have had the foresight to design panels that    put out the 14 to 16 volts necessary to charge a 12-volt    storage battery.</p><p> The batteries needed for photovoltaic    systems are the deep-cycle type commonly employed to provide    storage for windplants and power for electric vehicles.    They're different from standard automobile batteries in that    they were designed to withstand numerous discharging/charging    cycles. The storage cells are available in 2-volt, 6-volt, or    12-volt units.</p><p> In the same way that panels can be grouped to    produce the output required, any number of batteries may be    connected in parallel . . . as long as they <em>match the    voltage of the system</em> . And when wired in series, the    batteries <em>again</em> need to match the panel voltage (see    the example in Fig. 5).</p><p> To prevent the deep-cycle units from    overcharging, a specially designed regulator can be placed in    line with the electricitygenerating circuit. However, if you    set up a well-balanced system-one that consumes the    same amount of power as it generates-a charge regulator    shouldn't be necessary.		</p>    <h3>      AC TOO?    </h3>	<p>			Some electrical devices-such as powerful electric    motors and color television sets-can't be operated on direct    current. Fortunately, you can produce alternating current    from photovoltaic DC power by using an inverter. Such a    device employs a pair of switching transistors to change the    direction of the current 60 times per second. This form of    electricity is known as 60-cycle (or-hertz) alternating    current.</p><p> The AC voltage is then run through a step-up    transformer to yield the equivalent of household current.    Although you can find inverters in a wide variety of power    ranges, units of less than 500 watts are usually the easiest    to locate and the least expensive. The smaller inverters can    get by with 12-volt input current (as shown in Fig. 6), while    higher-wattage inverters generally require substantially    greater input voltages to overcome internal power losses    caused by the larger unit's heavier circuitry. For example, a    48-volt input is common for a 2.5KW inverter. Consequently,    when you're mapping out an expandable photovoltaic    installation, you need to design your series/parallel    arrangement to match any future inverter purchases. My own    system now consists of a 12-volt parallel setup with six    panels, batteries, and a couple of small 12-volt to 110-volt    AC inverters . . . but I plan eventually to expand it in    order to have a 110-volt DC array.	</p>	    <h3>      A HYBRID SYSTEM-THE ULTIMATE MARRIAGE?    </h3>	<p>			"That's all very interesting," you may be saying, "but    won't it <em>still</em> cost me an arm and a leg to get    started in photovoltaics?" The answer is that it might well    do so, save for the fact that solar electricity has one    further remarkable property: It is perfectly compatible with,    and can supplement, another generation package.</p><p> Let's say,    for instance, that you have a 500-watt wind charger, and the    system hasn't quite been able to meet all your needs.    Replacing it with a larger, more powerful generator would    likely require a new tower <em>plus</em> the new windplant.    In such a case, it's quite probable that solar electricity    could supply the needed extra energy at a substantial saving.    The panels can be made to match the wind generator's voltage    by linking the solar units in series. And if your wind    charger happens to be a 36-volt model, the addition of three    panels in series will almost double your power!</p><p> Now that    claim might sound a bit far fetched. Bear in mind, though,    that windplants are designed to stall in periods of    relatively calm breezes-such as often occur in the    middle of the day-during which time you must rely on    stored power. But it just so happens that solar cells are at    their peak at noon, so the panels can "fill in" for the idle    wind machine. And the reverse is frequently true under    adverse light conditions: During a storm the sun doesn't    shine much, but the wind sure does blow.</p><p> What's more, when    you're augmenting a wind system with photovoltaics, the    wiring is not at all complicated. If you anticipate problems    with overcharging, by all means include a    <em>photovoltaic</em> charge regulator along with any other    regulating unit that may already be in the system. Fig. 7    will show you what might be done.    </p>		<h3>      COMMONSENSE REMINDERS    </h3>	<p>			It should go without saying that you'll want to place    your panels in unshaded areas. But if you can't quite catch    every bit of the early or late sun, don't worry too much . .    . the most productive hours are between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.    (If you set up your system so it can <em>track</em> the sun,    you can increase its power output by about 40%.)</p><p> Locate your    storage batteries in a sheltered area that's well ventilated    (explosive gases are given off by active batteries) and    protected from extremes of temperature. The storage    site-as well as the panels-should also be as    close to your house as possible . . . to limit the line    losses that occur when electricity travels through wire. It's    a good idea to check the charge in the batteries regularly    with a hydrometer . . . and don't forget to add water as    needed.</p><p> Even though the panels themselves shouldn't require    maintenance, it doesn't hurt to dust the covers every so    often to let as much sunshine in as possible. And while    you're doing so, it's easy to make a quick inspection of the    connections.    </p>	<h3>	      A BRIGHT FUTURE    </h3>	<p>			Yes, photovoltaic power is here . . . and with a little    scrounging, you may well be able to set up an affordable    system today. Furthermore, the odds are that in a few years    solar-electric homes will become commonplace. ARCO Solar, for    example, claims that it will be selling economical homesized    arrays by the mid-1980's. Perhaps not long after that, the    most common powerplants will be those right on our own    individual rooftops!		</p>    		<hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:      T.J. Byers's own photovoltaic system consists of six panels      rated at 16 volts and 1.2 amperes each. The setup is      currently wired parallel to provide 7.2 peak amps of charge      to a 12-volt battery bank. From there, the power is      delivered both to 12-volt appliances and to small 110-VAC      inverters.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The panels themselves are "B" grade (cosmetically      defective) and consist of 32 obsolete 3-inch-diameter cells      . . . which T.J. managed to obtain for about $5.00 per watt      several years ago.
