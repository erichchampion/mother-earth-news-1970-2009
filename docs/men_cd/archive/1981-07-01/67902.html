            		 <p>      In Mother No. 62, we told you how to rid your garden of      many desctruction insects without resorting to dengerous      chemicals. Now here's...    </p>       <h5 id="byline">by Diane Downs</h5>        <p>      By midsummer, most gardeners expect their months of mulch      ing, tilling, composting, seeding, and weeding to begin to      pay off at last. Hungry horticulturists, however, aren't      the only creatures who've been keeping a watch on the      maturing produce, because July and August are also-in      most parts of North America-the peak of the "pest      season" . . . a time when beetles riddle cuke plants,      hornworms strip toma toes, and raccoons demolish corn.    </p>    <p>      But even if your crops are under siege by a veritable army      of produce plunderers, there's no reason to lay on a heavy      chemical hand. Numerous hazard-free, homegrown pest      repellents can help gardeners bring in big, healthful      harvests to feed their families. Of course, some remedies      are best employed at the beginning of the growing season      (an ounce of prevention, you know). And now-while the      results of not having taken protective measures at planting      time are all too obvious-is a good time to plan next      season's campaign. However, I'm also going to provide you      with a few ideas on how to discourage the bandits that may      be chomping on your crops at this very moment!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROTECT SQUASH, CORN, AND TOMATOES</strong>    </p>    <p>      You can, for example, guard your maturing cucumbers and      squash by using a handy kitchen discard ... onion skins!      Simply strew a big handful of these leftovers loosely      across the top of each hill, and let the legendary Allium      pungency drive away the most stubborn of cucumber beetles      (as the skins decay, they'll add valuable organic matter to      your soil).    </p>    <p>      For even more protection, you might border next year's      hilled areas with orange nasturtiums (Tropaeolum majus),      then further guard the mature plants by spraying a mix of      equal parts of wood ashes and hydrated lime in water on the      upper and lower surfaces of the spreading foliage.    </p>    <p>      Early in the year, you can fortify your future tomato      territory by sowing dill (Anethum graveolens) and borage      (Borago officinalis) to repel hornworms. Needless to say,      you'll enjoy these two useful and flavorful herbs for      themselves, as well as for their ability to protect your      tomato crop.    </p>    <p>      One of the high points of summer-at least around my      house-is the first menu that includes field-fresh      roasting ears dripping with butter ... and one of the low      points is finding out that raccoons, squirrels, or earworms      got to that dinner before we did! To prevent such a      catastrophe, consider trying a few of the following plans      of attack.    </p>    <p>      If your acreage allows, you might want to surround 1982's      crop of golden-eared goodies with a "soybean trap", which      will tempt any furry four-footed invaders to fill their      bellies with beans before they reach the succulent maize.      (For maximum efficiency, choose a soybean variety that will      mature when your corn does.) In addition, you'll find that      nasturtiums (which also repel aphids and Mexican bean      beetles), marigolds, and mustard rebuff numerous gnawing      pests by their color and pungent aroma. This year, you can      keep most of the competition away from your roasting ears      if you just walk through the patch, putting a pinch of      cayenne pepper on the silks.    </p>    <p>      Some folks also place crumpled newspapers between the rows      . . . scatter sections of garden hose cut in one- to      threefoot lengths (to resemble snakes) . . . hang pieces of      a broken mirror about . . . string Christmas tree lights      through the rows (who cares what the neighbors think!) . .      . and even play tape recordings of shotgun blasts to      discourage would-be produce pirates!    </p>    <p>      <strong>MIGHTY MARIGOLDS AND MOLE DESTROYERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      While both French and African marigolds (Tagetes erecta)      help rid soil of nematodes, the Mexican variety (Tagetes      minuta) apparently exudes a substance from its roots that's      actually toxic to certain invasive weeds! Try sowing the      potent flowers as a cover crop this autumn. Then, when next      year's planting time rolls around, the posies can be turned      under for one of the finest, most soil-cleansing green      manure crops your ground could hope for. Tagetes minuta is      also repellent to rabbits, and destroys innumerable      soilborn pests. So be extravagant with the flowers. Scatter      them throughout your orchard . . . surround your roses with      them ... and use some of the foliage to brew up a "tea" to      spray localized pest-infested areas.    </p>    <p>      If your midsummer plot is under attack by any below-ground      burrowers, you might want to plan to have a few mole plants      (Euphorbia lathyris) growing around the edges of your      garden next time around. The exotic-looking biennials with      their milky, latexlike sap (it's now being considered as a      potential source of petroleum substitutes) have long been      known as gopher deterrents . . . and they'll sow themselves      the second year, providing you with seedlings to place in      other moleridden spots.    </p>    <p>      Two other plants that can be sown to help eliminate moles      are the castor bean (Ricinus communis .. . which also fends      off flies and mosquitoes) and the common dandelion      (Taraxacum officinale). Castor bean seeds, however, are      poisonous, so be sure to caution neighborhood youngsters if      you grow this plant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SLUGS, BEETLES, AND MOTHS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Slugs, which are among the most damaging above-ground      pests, can be discouraged with a preparation made from      silicon-rich horsetails (Equisetum arvense). Once dried,      the plants produce a powder that's highly repellent to the      slimy slitherers. (You can also place discarded cabbage      leaves and grapefruit rinds-or even old      boards-throughout the garden in the evening. When day      breaks, check underneath the upsidedown "slug domes" . . .      remove the occupants . . . and either add them to your      ducks' breakfast menu or squash them.)    </p>    <p>      And, if Japanese beetles appear to be your primary enemy,      plan to plant castor beans, white-flowering      geraniums, zinnias, and garlic throughout your garden area      next year.    </p>    <p>      For more general purpose garden guarding, consider the      roadside herb, yarrow (Achillea millefolium). It not only      repels a number of pests, but is commonly be lieved to      enhance the growth and flavor of plants growing nearby.      Furthermore, Achillea's friendly qualities can be utilized      throughout the year if you simply brew the foliage into a      liquid fertilizer and water periodically with the "tea".    </p>    <p>      When your cole family vegetables face an invasion of      cabbage moths and their larvae (which can mutilate plants      in a few short days), rely upon an item from your kitchen:      Simply pour soured milk over the young cabbages, etc. to      keep the moths aloft and the worms away.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INDOOR PESTICIDES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Your special, tender greenhouse tenants need protection,      too, so always allow a few shoo-fly plants (Nicandra      physalodes) to occupy several places of honor in your      solarium. The attractive, fast-growing annuals are toxic to      all pests that chew them, and rebuff the white flies that      often plague enclosed gardens.    </p>    <p>      Homegrown pesticides can also keep your kitchen and food      storage areas free of unwanted guests. For example, a      couple of bay leaves (Laurus nobilis) in the bottom of      grain containers will keep them bug-free, and tiny cloth      bags of ground black pepper will prevent weevils from      infesting dried beans. Furthermore, if silverfish are      setting up housekeeping in your cupboards, just place      fragrant leaves of costmary (Chrysanthemum balsamita) in      each section of the cabinets to make the squatters move on.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MODERATION IN ALL THINGS . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      Resourceful gardeners have found innumerable common plants      that have pestchasing abilities. Sprays, for instance, can      be made from many different species and used for a variety      of purposes: The alkaloid exudates from nearly every type      of tomato foliage will deter aphids . . . stinging nettle      (Urtica dioica) spray encourages healthier plants . . . a      turnip or anise mist will rid your crops of spider mites      and aphids ... basil spray discourages flies (and mass      plantings of the herb around a porch or patio will also      repel the insects) ... and onion, garlic, horseradish,      mint, and chamomileflower sprays all have bugchasing      qualities of their own!    </p>    <p>      Even as you put such organic pesticides to use, though,      keep in mind that an insect or two here and there will not      pose a threat to your growing grounds. In small numbers the      invaders simply provide food for their natural predators,      such as swal lows ... each of whom may consume 2,000      insects a day! In fact, Mother Nature maintained a precious      and delicate balance long before we decided to intervene.      It's the duty of every concerned gardener to respect that      balance, and to use repellentseven natural ones-only when      populations of pests threaten to become excessive.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Author Diane Downs sells most of the plants      listed in this article, plus some 150 varieties of live      herb,. plants, herb seeds, and herbal products.
