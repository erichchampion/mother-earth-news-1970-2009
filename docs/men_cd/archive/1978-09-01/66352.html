                <p>      Homesteader William James earns up to $8.00 an hour for the      peaceful time he spends in the autum forest... how does he      do it?    </p>        <p>      Ten years back-when I took my initial walk through      our homestead's woods-I filled every available pocket      in my jacket with wild nuts from the numerous tall hickory      trees scattered throughout our ten acres. That was the      first time I tasted the rich "walnut and rum" flavor of      these excellent edibles . . . and the first (but not the      last) time 1 smacked a finger or two as I tried to crack      the hard, pale nutshells.    </p>    <p>      My wife and I have lived in these woods ever since that      first magic autumn a decade ago. And each fall we take      advantage of our nut crop . . . just as we forage the      dewberries and plums of other seasons.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, as we've learned the locations of our      trees-and become better at beating the squirrels to a      fair portion of the crop-our nut baskets have grown      in size from quarts to pecks to bushels. In short, it      wasn't long until we found that we were harvesting more      hickory nuts than we could ever use. So . . . we decided to      try to sell our surplus.    </p>    <h3>      NUTS TO YOU . . . FOR A PRICE!    </h3>    <p>      At the time, we had already attempted to market foraged      wild foods once before without any real success. But that      had been pecans . . . which took forever to gather, didn't      weigh much (our markets buy by the pound),      and-because they are very susceptible to insect      pests-didn't produce reliably large crops every year.      We finally gave up on the pecans as a salable commodity ...      though we always had-and still have-enough for      personal use.    </p>    <p>      Hickory trees, on the other hand, aren't particularly      vulnerable to much of anything. We've found that our      hickories produce at least something every year . . . and      each fall one or two can be counted on to yield a "bumper"      crop.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, hickory nuts are heavy. One person under a      good tree can easily collect twenty pounds of the hulled      but unshelled delectable edibles in an hour! Since we get      40 cents a pound when we sell our free-for-the-gathering      nuts to local merchants (mostly "organic" food stores and      an occasional supermarket), that means our "wages" for a      pleasant day in the woods figure out to about eight dollars      an hour. [EDITOR'S NOTE: We checked with several North      Carolina health food stores and found that most were      interested in buying foraged hickory nuts. None of these      outlets could quote us a per-pound figure, however, simply      because no one had ever brought any in to sell to them! We      also found that some supermarkets will buy hickories as      sort of "wild-pet food" . . . to attract suburban      squirrels!]    </p>    <p>      My wife and I have noted that the larger stores resell our      nuts for as much as 60 cents a pound, while a local co-op      only asks 46 cents for the same quantity. Either way,      though, the customer gets tasty meatless protein for a      price that's less than half that charged for most other      sources of this necessary substance. Nobody-in other      words-gets ripped off in these wild hickory nut      transactions.    </p>    <p>      And because of the low pricein addition to their good taste      and "folksy" appeal-wild hickory nuts do sell easily.      Last year we marketed a total of 450 pounds (all that we      could spare) .. . which put a handy $180 in the of sugar      bowl!    </p>        <h3>      FINDING THE FOREST, FOR THE TREES    </h3>    <p>      If you live almost anywhere in the eastern two-thirds of      the continent between southern Ontario and Florida, you're      probably within a few miles of one species of hickory or      another. The trees usually can be found in rich, reasonably      moist soil . . . both in forests and bordering cleared      land. City folks often can locate substantial stands of      these darkbarked giants in parks or along those (usually      older) streets that have been able to preserve their shade      trees despite the "lop 'em off' pressures of the phone and      power companies.    </p>    <p>      Even in heavily populated areas, there generally isn't much      competition for the hickory nut harvest. Most people, it      seems, don't know one of the hardshelled goodies from a      cereal commercial. And those who do can be pretty much      divided into two groups: The folks [1] who would rather      have someone else (like you) gather and sell the harvest .      . . so that they can buy it and not risk the stigma (?) of      being seen foraging themselves, and [2] the poor      unfortunates who-out of ignorance-think that      the tough husks and small meats make hickory nuts just      plain not worth the bother (the sidebar that accompanies      this article should help to change that misconception).    </p>    <p>      So (luckily for you) with so much misinformation around,      you probably won't have to fight too hard for ground space      under your favorite tree. And that "private" hickory won't      be difficult to identify, either. If the photos on these      pages aren't enough for you . . . most any library should      have an assortment of field guides that will do the job.      Furthermore, as soon as you've located just one of these      trees, you'll probably become aware of a number of others      all around you that you've been overlooking for years (once      your eyes have been opened, there's something distinctive      about a hickory). Don't worry about which of the several      species of the tree you find yourself under, either. Though      they do vary in the quality of their flavor, any mature and      healthy hickory nut you're likely to find will be "good      enough to eat".    </p>    <p>      And here's another tip: Keep an eye peeled, too, for old      dead trees-and fallen limbs-in any group of      hickories that you discover. The dry wood makes an      exceptional fuel . . . it burns long and hot and the smoke      has a pleasant aroma. In fact, as I'm sure you know,      hickory is the preferred wood for smokehouse use.    </p>    <p>      Which, of course, is why we've found that some      markets-in addition to the nuts that we      sell-are glad to buy split and sacked hickory wood.      However, if you try your hand at this business, please      remember to salvage only individual timbers that have no      recent growth. Living hickories are too valuable-and      beautiful-to be turned into fuel.    </p>    <p>      And save some of that wood and those nuts for yourself,      too! A good portion of our hickory harvest-wood and      nuts-ends up on and in our cookstove when we prepare      "special" goodies for all those holidays coming up. The      nutmeats can be substituted in (and will improve) any      recipe that calls for walnuts or pecans . . . and hickory      nut bread-especially when baked over a hickory fire -is      several magnitudes of delicious better than ambrosia!    </p>    <h3>      HICKORY CONSCIOUSNESS?    </h3>    <p>      All over America, every day, land is      converted-violently-from forest to field.      Though federal agencies and lumber companies do sometimes      reptant, they seem to favor the various pines for their      reforestation projects ... while our deciduous trees (the      ones that shed their leaves every year) continue to get      pushed back-month by month-onto a smaller and      smaller section of the landscape.    </p>    <p>      Maybe if more people tasted hickory nuts-or just      spent a little time under these trees-the shaggy      titans might come to be considered an asset (like fruit      trees, for example) to a, piece of property. Perhaps      "hickory consciousness" can save some of these nut bearers      from the 'dozer and chain saw . . . and increase this      country's appreciation for its other wild foods in the      bargain.    </p>    <p>      Heck, we always knew that Euell Gibbons wasn't really      advertising those Grape Nuts, didn't we?    </p>    <h3>      STILL CURIOUS?    </h3>    <p>      More information on hickories can be found in "Food Without      Farming", MOTHER NO. 7, pages 71-76, which is available for      $2.50 plus 95 cents shipping and handling from THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted), P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North      Carolina 28739. And an especially good large paperback      field guide, The Tree Identification Book by George W.D.      Symonds (William Morrow, 1958), is available for $6.95 from      good bookstores, or for $6.95 plus 95d shipping and      handling from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739.    </p>    <p>      Happy foraging ... and may the local market for hickory      nuts in your area be as good as the one I've found down      here in south central Texas!    </p>    <h3>      How To Crack a Hickory Nut    </h3>        <p>      First, off, there isn't anything I can tell you that will      make your hickory nutmeats pile up as rapidly and as easily      as, say, walnuts. However, as with most tasks, there's a      right way and a wrong way to open these stubborn little      cusses.    </p>    <p>      If you have a nutcracker, simply place the nut so that the      two pointed ends contact the surfaces of the tool (see      drawing). Then apply firm-but      controlled-pressure to crack the shell. Experts can      open hickories so that the meats fall out whole most of the      time... but you should content yourself (at first) with a      few big chunks. Use a nutpick or a large pin to remove the      rest.    </p>    <p>      When you crack a hickory nut with a hammer, make sure that      the nut is placed point down on a hard surface. Your first      good blow should crack the shell into accessible segments.      You then can break each of the individual pieces open by      directing your mallet to the outside of its husk... while      keeping the shell as nearly perpendicular to the floor (or      whatever) as you can.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to throw those scraps of shell out for the birds      and squirrels, too. They'll be happy to pick out the tiny      pieces of meat that you overlooked.    </p>
