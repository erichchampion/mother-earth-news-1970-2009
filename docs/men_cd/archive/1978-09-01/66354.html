                        <p>      <em>Yep! After years of scrimping and saving every penny      (many of which came from MOTHER's Lifetime Subscribers),      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) has finally purchased 622.4      acres of beautiful mountains and valleys and streams and      lakes and clearings and shady groves and ferny dells and      pastures and woodlands and old log cabins not very far from      her home offices in Hendersonville, North Carolina.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The photographs across the top of these two pages will      give you a small idea of the incredible variety of      elevations (running from 2,080 to 2,720 feet above sea      level), soil, native flora and fauna, etc., that you'll      find on this nearly-mile-square piece of property.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And if you've been reading this magazine any length of      time at all, you've .probably already got an inkling of the      passively solarheated underground :dwellings, biodynamic      gardens, self-contained hydroelectric systems, wind plants,      and other environmentally oriented installations that we'll      soon be making on MOTHER's land.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>The idea, in short, is to tap the best and most      inventive minds of the world (many of whom you've already      seen featured in this magazine's pages) to construct a      showplace "Community of the Future": a food selfsufficient,      energy self-sufficient village that "rests lightly" on the      surrounding countryside . . . a delightful place in which      to live, filled with inhabitants who couldn't care less if      the Arabs shut off the oil, the coal miners go on strike,      or the nation's truckers refuse to haul food across state      lines.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Or, to put it another way: We (and you) already know      that $100,000 homes can be constructed for $20,000 . . .      and that once you move into such a dwelling, the house can      be heated and cooled forevermore for no more than $15 or      $20 a year. And that it's extremely fulfilling (rather than      a chore) to grow far more healthful food for your family      yourself than any supermarket will ever sell. And that it's      better (and easier) to set up your own home business than      to punch a time clock. And that communities-once      again-can be designed and built for people, instead      of cars. And we (and you) know many other related things .      . . if, for no other reason, than that we've all read about      them in this magazine.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>But just publishing a story about a passively      solar-heated house here . . . and a successful home      business there ... and a new wholistic gardening      breakthrough somewhere else . . . isn't good enough      anymore. If we ever hope to rub this society's nose in the      fact that life can be different, and better, and more      environmentally oriented, and more satisfying in the      bargain . . . we're just going to have to bring all of      these good things together in one spot at the same time for      everyone to see firsthand.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's exactly what MOTHER's Community of the      Future is all about. And we're well on our way to making it      a reality. And we expect to keep right on financing this      work very largely the same way we've been financing it in      the past: with the revenues we receive from the sale of      Lifetime Subscriptions to this magazine.</em>    </p>    <p>      So if you've ever thought about signing up for a      lifetime of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), this is the time to      do it <em>(just as 3,003 other good people-see page 61 of this      issuehave already done).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Your investment ($300 for U.S. subscribers, $350      Canadian and foreign), remember, does three things: [l] It      makes it just that much easier for us to keep publishing      still bigger and better MOTHERS, [2] it assures you of      receiving every one of those issues that you're entitled to      for as long as there is a MOTHER (forever, we hope!), and      [3] it helps us finance the Environmental Research Center      that we're already starting to build on the lovely piece of      land you see above.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>That's really stretching today's shrinking dollar and,      in return for your non-refundable contribution, you will      receive [I] every issue of MOTHER that is printed for as      long as you live, [2] recognition-unless you request      otherwise-in this magazine, [3] a genuine Certificate of      Thanks, [4] your nameunless you request otherwise-listed      permanently at the Center as one of The People Who Made      This Research Center Possible, and [5] the satisfaction of      becoming part of, we hope, Something That Counts.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>ONE FINAL NOTE: Inflation, as you know, is really      starting to get out of hand here in the United States (and      in other parts of the world) and all signs point to even      worse inflation in the years ahead. For that reason, the      price of a lifetime subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      will be raised to $500 for U.S. subscribers and $600 for      subscribers in Canada and all foreign countries as of      January 1, 1979.</em>    </p>    <p>      This, then, is the last time you'll ever have a chance      to take advantage of the current bargain price for yourself      or for anyone that you want to give the "best possible"      Christmas present to this year. Better hurry if you want to      get in while the old rates are still good!    </p>    <p>      Just fill out the handy, pre-addressed order envelope      that should be bound right in between these two pages, slip      in your check, seal, and drop the form in the mail.
