                <p>      <em>You might have that extra "cold cash" that you      need-for your homestead expenses or city      savings-right at your fingertips. Just apply those      digits to a typewriter and . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Luilla Thompson    </h5>    <p>      No matter how much of the food and other essentials of life      you and your family produce for yourselves out there on the      of homestead (or in your small town back yard or wherever)      . . . it's a cinch that you still need some cash money from      time to time. You know: to pay off those backward      individuals (like the tax collector) who haven't caught on      to barter yet. And if you still live and work in a big city      . . surely you could use a few additional dollars to help      you meet those ever-present bills or to get yourself ready      for the Big Move out into the country. But you already know      that. The question is: Do I know of any relatively easy,      non-time-consuming ways for you to pick up those bucks.    </p>    <p>      And the answer is: Yes. I do. If you can write-not      "fancy stuff", just plain clear sentences that folks can      understand-and if you have five hours or so a week to      devote to an occupation that's almost too much fun to be      called work . . . you could make up to $150 a month (just      as I do) as a correspondent for your local newspaper.    </p>    <h3>      YOU'LL NEED SOME EQUIPMENT    </h3>    <p>      The most important "tool of the trade"-for anyone who      wants to write for pay-is, of course, a typewriter.      Believe me, no editor is going to pay much attention to      your work (even if you do expose a Grange hall Watergate)      if it's scribbled down on "cute" note paper or torn from a      spiral-bound pad.    </p>    <p>      And-whether your "writing machine" is an expensive electric      or a garage sale special-keep a fresh, black ribbon      in the typewriter at all times and keep the machine's keys      clean. Remember: The appearance of your written copy is the      first thing an editor will notice. Make that copy neat.      Make it crisp.    </p>    <p>      It's also a good idea-if you're interested in earning      the maximum possible income from this part-time      job-to equip yourself with (and learn to use) a      reliable-but not necessarily      expensive-35-millimeter camera.    </p>    <p>      Relax. I didn't know anything about cameras (except for the      little Kodak-types) either, until I bought a $95 K-Mart      Focal ES 35mm picture taker especially for my job. But I      did memorize that camera's instruction manual before I      bought and ran my first roll of film through it. And then,      a week later, I went back and spent another $9.00 at the      same department store for an electronic flash attachment .      . . so I could take good indoor shots with the little      picture clicker. So far I haven't needed anything else to      take photographs that a newspaper will pay for.    </p>    <p>      OK. Once you have your photo equipment, don't go anywhere      without it (you'd be amazed at the number of stories I've      missed because my "magic box" was at home). And don't let      the camera magazines seduce you into trying "artsy"      photography . . . at least not for your news stories. All a      newspaper needs (or wants) are simple, clearly focused      pictures.    </p>    <p>      You'll need a note pad and pen, of course, to round out      your "tools of the trade". A cassette recorder-which      does come in handy from time to time but isn't really      essential in the beginning-can be picked up later if      you think you need it.    </p>    <h3>      GO GET THAT ASSIGNMENT    </h3>    <p>      Before you run down to your local daily to apply for a job,      and even before you start on a sample story, get to know      the newspaper (or papers) that you hope to work for. Find      out what kind of articles it prints and whether its      audience is rural, urban, or a little of both. Then look      for stories in your community that will appeal to at least      half of those readers. And remember: The paper wants news .      . . not opinions or personal comments. Report the facts.    </p>    <p>      And when you do submit those facts in the form of a sample      article, the piece should be typed with a black ribbon on      white paper and it should be doublespaced, with plenty of      margin down both sides (to allow the editor to make      changes). Furthermore, until you learn how your paper's      editor wants it done, the article should be set up in a      professional manner, like this:    </p>    <p>      On the first page, in the upper left corner, type the      following . . .    </p>    <p>      THE DATE    </p>    <p>      YOUR NAME<br />      YOUR ADDRESS<br />      YOUR PHONE NUMBER    </p>    <p>      . . . and then begin your story.    </p>    <p>      Agonize over that first piece. Sweat over that copy. Tear      up draft after draft until you've made that story just as      good as you can possibly make it. Then go to the paper and      show the article to the regional editor.    </p>    <p>      Don't be afraid to ask questions. Most editors are always      looking for good writers and will be glad to give you      assistance. Especially if your "example" pieces (three or      four are better than one) are interesting and concise (400      to 600 words is the best length for local features ... 800      words is about the limit), and show a knowledge of the      community that you plan to cover.    </p>    <p>      [EDITOR'S NOTE: We contacted the regional editor of the      Asheville (North Carolina) Citizen-Times and found that he      was, indeed, often on the lookout for local "stringers".      His paper covers seventeen counties, and uses one or snore      correspondents from each.]    </p>    <p>      If you get an assignment (you'll usually work "on spec",      which means that you write the stories and the paper will      pay you if it uses 'em), don't be surprised if the      money-especially at first-isn't quite as      glamorous as you might have expected. My paper pays me      50 cents for every inch of printed newspaper column that it      buys (other newspapers shell out $1.00 or more for the same      "column inch") and $5.00 for each photo it uses. You can      also expect to be reimbursed for any phone calls or travel      (at 100 a mile) that are necessary to a story. Most      newspapers will both buy and develop your film, too. This      all adds up faster than you'd think.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO FIND A STORY    </h3>    <p>      I rarely go out looking for articles. Instead, I just kind      of make myself available in case they want to find me.    </p>    <p>      For instance, while I was at the grain elevator the other      day I learned that the structure just happened to be the      oldest of its kind in my area . . . and the only one within      a hundred miles that still sells coal. A few questions,      several pictures . . . and I had a story that earned me      $15!    </p>    <p>      Then, on my way home, I stopped at the post office and      became involved in a conversation with a woman who-it      turned out-was the caretaker at the local cemetery.      "How many women gravediggers can there be?" I asked myself,      and the article which resulted from that question put      another $12 in my pocket. And while I was taking the lady      caretaker's picture, she told me that the fish hatchery was      being remodeled, which-you guessed it!-led to      another article and yet another check. And so it goes.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO "WORK UP" A PIECE    </h3>    <p>      After I've taken notes and snapped photographs, I type my      stories up at home . . . and always make a carbon copy for      myself. I also make it a practice to keep careful notes on      the pictures that I shoot (I try to take several of each      subject). I then refer to those notes as I type up photo      captions (on a separate sheet of paper) to send in with the      articles and the undeveloped film.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to keep an itemized statement on each story that      you mail (many papers require that you turn in such a      statement if you expect to get paid for your work!). This      "file" should include the number of column inches in the      article, how many photos were used, any expenses you had      while covering the story, and most anything else you can      think of. Good records are a must!    </p>    <h3>      STOP THE PRESSES    </h3>    <p>      Who knows where your job as a local news correspondent      might lead you? (Mine gave me the courage to send an      article to MOTHER!) But-whether it's the start of a      career or just a handy method of payin' the      bills-that regular check from the local paper can be      a first step toward a more independent (and better!) life.    </p>    <p>      At least that's the way I look at it out here in      Broadwater, Nebraska as I continue to put in a scant five      or six hours a week as a newspaper correspondent . . .      while happily cashing checks which-each      month-add up to $100 and more. If I can do it, I'll      betcha you can too!    </p>
