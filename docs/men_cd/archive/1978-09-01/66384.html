    <p>
                        <p>      The next time you're toolin' down the of Interstate and you      come up behind (or are passed by!) some thing that looks      like a cross between Noah's Ark, a redwood sauna, and a      vintage Winnebago ... consider yourself privileged. 'Cause      that contraption is Ed Walkinstik's Amazing Solar Chariot,      and it-just like its owner and operator-is, to      say the least, unusual . . . and just a little hung up on      the sun and what its energy can do for mankind.    </p>    <p>      Ed-who's half Choctaw and grew up on a reservation in      Oklahoma-says that he first became aware of Ol' Sol's      power when, as a boy, "I burned my bare feet on a blacktop      road during the summer."    </p>    <p>      Apparently that lesson stuck, even through growing up and      the 16 years that Walkinstik spent working with the      Department of Defense. Because-back in about '72 or      '73-Ed paid $25 for the chassis of a 1946 Chevrolet      truck (which he had to dig out of a field), got permission      to tear some well-seasoned wood out of an old art studio,      rounded up a bunch of other recycled materials . . . and      set to work.    </p>    <p>      Two years later he was ready to put the Solar      Chariot-complete with shower, toilet, refrigerator      and kitchen, dining and sleeping areas, you name      it-on the road. And just not so incidentally:      Walkinstik's rolling home is also outfitted with a      solar-heated water supply, solar ovens, and a whole gob of      sun-powered parabolic troughs and photovoltaic cells and      other equipment that Ed can use to show people just how      easy it is to harness OI' Sol's energy in a number of ways.    </p>    <p>      And that, of course, is exactly what Walkinstik, his little      dog (Hope), and the Amazing Solar Chariot now spend all      their time doing: Racking up 70,000 miles annually simply      going from place to place conducting solar workshops for      schools, colleges, environmental organizations, and other      groups (even individuals!).    </p>    <p>      Ed has also lobbied in Washington ("a waste of my time")      and California (Jerry Brown is "Alice in Wonderland") . . .      but he finds his message is best received by the "salt of      the earth" folks-people like you and us-that he      talks to.    </p>    <p>      So: If you or your organization would like to have Ed drop      in and set up a solar energy workshop for you the next time      he's passing through your area (or you'd like to have      Walkinstik run a product test on a sunpowered piece of      hardware for you), write and ask. His address is Mr. Ed      Walkinstik, The Solar Chariot, P.O. Box 511, North      Highlands, California 95660. And don't forget to include a      dollar or two and a stamped, self-addressed, long envelope      with your query . . . just to help Ed out a little with the      cost of sending you a reply.    </p>
