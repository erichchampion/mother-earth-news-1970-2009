All rights reserved.    </p>            <h3>      EGGS PAID FOR LIGHTS    </h3>    <p>      LEWIS WHITE, a Pulaski county, Indiana, farmer started      giving more careful attention to his poultry flock some      years ago and by continually keeping records on all his      farm enterprises, he learned that the poultry was paying      him better than any other part of the farm enterprise.    </p>    <p>      Better feeding came first, then better breeding, the flock      was tested for bacillary white diarrhea, then better      housing facilities were provided. Then the "experts"      commenced to talk lights to increase feed consumption which      would mean increased egg production. The Whites debated for      three or four seasons whether or not they should put in      electric lights. They were told that the increased      production in a single year would pay for installation of      the lights. Finally four neighbors including White went      together and got. the "juice" out from the town two miles      away.    </p>    <p>      The lights were turned on to both the hens and pullets the      twenty-fifth of September. A little later White started to      feeding an all-mash ration and while both this and the      lights seem to have greatly increased egg production, White      avers that the total egg receipts during October more than      paid his share of the cost of getting the lights. He now      believes that those who told him that he paid for lights      whether he had them or not were telling the truth.-I.      J. M., Ind.    </p>    <h3>      TEST THE GRAVEL FIRST    </h3>    <p>      Sometimes when concrete fails to set properly, we blame the      cement, when perhaps the gravel is at fault.    </p>    <p>      Cement authorities tell us that gravel ought to be tested      before it is used fur concrete work, to determine its      suitability. The test they suggest is made as follows:    </p>    <p>      Take a fruit jar or other suitable receptacle, put in four      inches of gravel or sand, and fill with water; shake well      and let settle.    </p>    <p>      If more than one-fourth inch of fine silt or clay particles      settle to the bottom the sample is considered unfit for      good concrete construction. Probably about twenty-four      hours are required for the settling.    </p>    <p>      Any farmer who wishes to test out his gravel to determine      its suitability fur concrete manufacture, can easily run      this simple test.-O. A. H., Ill.    </p>    <h3>      WITH THE BEES    </h3>    <p>      COMMON honey bees have long been a source of study and      cultivation. They are supposed to be of Asiatic origin, and      were domesticated along the eastern shores of the      Mediterranean at the dawn of history. They followed Roman      civilization as it advanced into Europe. Early colonists      brought them to America. In the long history of the bee,      several races have been developed.    </p>    <p>      In 1860 the United States department of agriculture      commenced a world-wide search for the best races of bees,      and as a result we have four varieties, each excelling      others in certain ways.    </p>    <p>      The German bees, black or brown, seem to have become better      acclimated. They are the common wild bees of the country.      They have a bad temper, and are not easy to handle.      Occasionally they desert their combs.    </p>    <p>      A bit careless in some respects, they are an easy prey to      the bee moth. They must be watched carefully, else      caterpillars, moths and cocoons take possession of the      comb. These bees are not the best honey gatherers. They      make white comb honey.    </p>    <p>      The Italian bees are large and beautiful. They were      imported m 1860, and have become quite popular. These bees      are noted for their gentleness, and are very industrious.      They will continue their work while the frame is lifted,      and the queen can be found without any difficulty.    </p>    <p>      The Italian bees resist the attack of the bee moth. In the      colder parts of the country they do not winter very well.      They are better honey gatherers than the German bee.    </p>    <p>      The gentlest and most beautiful of all bees are the      Carniolans. In color they are ashy gray, with silvery white      hairs. In 1884 these bees were imported from Carniola, an      Alpine province. They withstand the winter better than any      other race. No bees swarm so successively. This is clue, it      is said, to the warm summers. Their honey is very white.      These bees are very prolific.    </p>    <h3>      KILL SOME GARDEN PESTS    </h3>    <p>      THOSE parts of the garden on which there may be some trash      remaining, where the garden was not fall plowed, might well      be burned over. This will kill enormous numbers of insects      that attempt to hibernate in trash, weed, etc., that may be      in and around the garden.    </p>        <h3>      WHICH GATE WILL SAG?    </h3>    <p>      THE sagging of doors with braces set at different angles      and the advantage of the tensile strength of wood over the      compression strength was shown in some recent tests      conducted by the Iowa state college.    </p>    <p>      The popular opinion is that gate No. 1 would stand the      greatest strain. Gate No. 2 looks like it would pull loose      and sag more easily.    </p>    <p>      A weight of 700 pounds was hung at the outer corner of the      gates, which were hinged well up from the floor, for a      forty-hour period. At the end of that time gate No. 1 had      sagged three-eighths of an inch; gate No. 2 had not sagged      enough that it could be measured.    </p>    <p>      The weight was then increased to 1,100 pounds. Under this      load gate No. 1 sagged three-fourths of an inch and gate      No. 2 sagged one-half inch, still showing the advantage of      the brace in the position of the No. 2 gate.    </p>    <p>      It was pointed out that for a door that received      considerable abuse, so that the nails would be likely to      work loose, the brace in No. 1 would probably be      better.-R. E. B., Iowa.    </p>    <h3>      SQUIBS-FROM A FARM WIFE'S NOTEBOOK    </h3>    <p>      Casters on the woodbox turn hard work into play for the      youngsters.    </p>    <p>      The next time a recipe calls for sour milk and there is      none available, try adding a teaspoonful of vinegar to a      cupful of sweet milk. The result will be the same as if      sour mill: had been used.    </p>    <p>      With part of a snap fastener sewed on your apron belt and      the other part on your stove holder, there will be no      mislaid holder just when it is most needed.    </p>    <p>      Right! Turn over a new leaf. You need not. mention to      anyone the number of the page.    </p>    <p>      When a cake burns at the bottom, as it sometimes will, let      it cool and then scrape off the burnt portion with a nutmeg      grater or other small grater.    </p>    <p>      Those who find it necessary to baste things before sewing      will find it much quicker to use pins, as there will be no      basting threads to remove when the garment is      finished.-Mrs. M. V. S.    </p>
