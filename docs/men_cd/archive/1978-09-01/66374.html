                        <p>      When I feel too dragged-out to face the chore of my weekly      bread-bake-or when the family seems in need of a      little variety-I whip up a great big batch of lefse      (pronounced lef-sa), an easy-to-make Scandinavian flat      bread.    </p>    <p>      Lefse is similar in appearance and texture to the Mexican      tortilla. Both are all-purpose foods that can be eaten hot      or cold, with butter or most any filling, and by themselves      or as a "sop-up" for gravies and soups. But, unlike the      Mexican griddle bread, large's primary ingredient is      leftover mashed potatoes!    </p>    <p>      The basic recipe for the flat bread goes like this:    </p>    <p>      1 gallon cold, well mashed potatoes<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      3 cups whole wheat or unbleached white flour    </p>    <p>      Lefse dough, however, does take to modification so kindly      that there's nothing "engraved in stone" about this      formula. I usually just make up lots of extra potatoes, add      "a little" salt and butter, and mix in enough flour to make      a soft, rollable (but not sticky) lump. (A Norwegian friend      told me that a good lefse dough should be of the same      consistency as an ear lobe! )    </p>    <p>      You can-if you want to be "traditional"-roll      out a cupful of dough until it's 1/8 of an inch thick, and      then cut individual "patties" from it.    </p>    <p>      I find it easier, though, to pinch off walnut-sized balls      of uncooked lefse and put them between two sheets of      plastic coated with vegetable oil (old grocery produce bags      work just fine). Then I either squash the clumps flat with      my hand or roll 'em with a rolling pin, and peel 'em off      the "wrappers". If you try this method and find that your      dough sticks, check the bags to be sure they're evenly      oiled and the mixture itself (it might be a bit too      sticky). The whole process probably will go a little slowly      at first . . . but once you "get the hang of it" you'll      turn out lefse faster than you can cook 'em.    </p>    <p>      These "pan breads" should be fried on a "sizzlin' hot",      lightly greased griddle. Just turn 'em once and each side      will be done when it becomes speckled with dark brown dots.    </p>    <p>      My family likes lefse best "hot off the stove" with butter      and sometimes a little honey. You'll find a lot of ways to      serve it, though, and it's possible to stretch your      experimentation out over a few days . . . the dough will      keep that long if it's covered and stored in a cool place.    </p>    <p>      So, take it from me: When you're too beat for bread, try      lefse instead!    </p>
