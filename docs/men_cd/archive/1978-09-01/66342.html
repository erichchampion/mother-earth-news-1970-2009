        <p>Bicycles, as most everyone knows, are fun . . . and the two-wheeled contraptions provide darn good exercise, too. In fact, biking's popularity has grown "hand in handlebar" with that of running . . . as more and more folks realize that the human body can't stay healthy if it isn't used every once in a while.</p><p>The riders who showed up in the Colorado Rockies July 8-15 for the 1978 Red Zinger Classic, however, weren't there to tighten their tummies. These people came to participate in one of the most prestigious amateur bicycle races in the world.</p><p>Over 160 entrants, both men and women, raced for a total of 19 hours over twisting roads that ranged from 6,000 to 12,500 feet above sea level. One out of every four of these participants-the percentage held true for both sexes-however, found that he or she just wasn't up to the demands made by the course . . . and had to quit before the event was over.</p><p>Those who finished the race-which was actually made up of a number of separate competitions-included representatives of the Olympic teams from ten countries, and a whole slew of talented "privateers".</p><p>And, when the bikes were set aside and the awards presented, 40,000 spectators saw George Mount of California declared the men's overall champion . . . and women's class honors given to Holland's Keetie Van enHage. Team trophies went to the Cateyes, a U.S. women's bicycle club, and to the United States national team.</p><p>Just four years ago the "Zinger" wasn't much more than an unknown event for local sportsmen. The race has come a long way since then, especially since its "success story" has taken place while a lot of traditional sports have declined in popularity. But the competition's sponsors-Celestial Seasonings and Red Seal Potato Chips-aren't satisfied. "Hey," they say, "if you thought this year was something, come see us in 1979!</p>
