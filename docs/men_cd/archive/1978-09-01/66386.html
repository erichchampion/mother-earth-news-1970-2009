                        <p>      I never did have any luck trying to raise garlic. Never,      that is, until I accidentally stumbled onto the "Ultimate      Garlic-Growing Secret": Treat 'em like daffodils and plant      'em in the fall! That way, the plants can start sproutin'      very early the following spring (exactly the way that      crocuses and daffodils do), grow rapidly during the      still-cool days which follow, and "set" their bulbs long      before the hot days of summer that can be so wiltingly hard      on "regular" spring-planted garlic.    </p>    <p>      Yeah, I know. Most of the gardening books tell you to plant      garlic in the spring . . . and to space the bulbs three      inches from each other in rows laid out 12 inches apart. I      also know what always happened to my crop when I followed      that advice:    </p>    <p>      The garlic would grow fine during the remaining days of      spring . . but then the inevitable hot, dry New Mexico      summers that my vegetable patch has to contend with would      hit the plants like a blast furnace. By the time fall      rolled around, all I'd have to show for my efforts would be      a few shriveled bulbs that measured about half the size of      the "store-bought" kind. And, as you know . . . being      outdone by the local supermarket riles the heart of any      gardener!    </p>    <p>      And so I proceeded through life . . . riled year after year      by one stunted crop of garlic after another. And      then-one fall-I accidentally missed a bulb as I      was digging up what little garlic had managed to make it      through the summer. And that single, solitary bulb . . .      just sat out there in the garden through the following      winter . . . . like a smug little time bomb . . . . waiting      for a new growing season. Little was I to know (at the      time, anyway) the fortunate consequences of that accident.    </p>    <p>      It wasn't until the following spring-about the time      the daffodils started sprouting-that I noticed a      small, suspicious clump of green shoots out in the middle      of the vegetable patch. "What the dickens are you doing      here?" I asked. Naturally enough, the clump didn't answer .      . . but I swear it had a sly smile on its little green      face.    </p>    <p>      My first impulse, of course, was to rip out the offending      sprouts, since they quite obviously were going to do      nothing but get in the way of my other gardening      operations. Then curiosity got the best of me (I knew the      foliage was garlic, but I didn't know how well it would      grow), and I ended up working around it.    </p>    <p>      As you may have suspected, I was dead certain that the      tight bunch of garlic would never amount to anything. I      mean: How could nine or ten cloves all crowded together      like that ever find the elbow room they'd need to form      fullsized bulbs? Ridiculous! I was sure that when I dug the      clump up, I'd find nothing but a handful of the scrawniest      little garlic bulbs I'd ever laid my eyes on.    </p>    <p>      Imagine my surprise, then, when I excavated the "mistake" .      . . and discovered that each clove in the original "lost"      bulb had formed a FULL-SIZED bulb of its own! "Hey! Maybe      I'm on to something!" I thought, as visions of gigantic      garlic pizzas danced through my head.    </p>    <p>      The following November 9 (as soon as I was sure the      temperature would stay below freezing every night-so      the cloves wouldn't sprout prematurely-but before the      earth froze solid) I put a somewhat more systematic      autumnplanted garlic patch in the ground.    </p>    <p>      First, I used a spade to dig up an area about one foot      square (this took approximately 20 seconds). Then I worked      in plenty of compost to make a mellow growing "bed". After      that I stuck whole, fat cloves of garlic-spaced two inches      apart each way-into the loose soil and covered them      with about an inch of dirt. And finally, I spread a little      mulch over the bed and edged it with rocks so I wouldn't      forget and accidentally tromp on it during the winter.    </p>    <p>      The first foolhardy shoots from the planting appeared two      and a half months later (on January 23) after two      consecutive days which were so rainy that the ground began      to thaw. Personally, I was convinced the cold winter air      would soon do the tender little sprouts in . . . but they      seemed to have their own ideas. By the first of February it      was apparent that the tiny plants very definitely were      serious about poking their heads up through the mulch which      covered them. And, since the daffodils had come up by then      too, I figured the shoots knew what they were doing and      left them alone.    </p>    <p>      The garlic's tops grew slowly until early April. Then, as      the nights turned warmer, the foliage quickly doubled in      size. Almost immediately, bulbs began to form on the      garlic's roots . . , and, by the first of June (when those      bulbs were nearly as large as they were to get), the leaves      had already started to dry out and yellow.    </p>    <p>      I harvested those bulbs in mid-June (when the      spring-planted garlic in nearby gardens had barely gotten      off to a start), and was I ever pleased with the results!      Each individual clove was as big as any you'll ever find in      a supermarket. Take that, Piggly Wiggly!    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, I've stuck with my "mistake" ever since      ... and I've always gotten outstanding results. So, garlic      lovers and gardeners everywhere: Plant your crop in the      fall this time. And, next June, just see if you don't agree      with me that autumn-planted garlic is the best and the most      successful garlic of all!    </p>
