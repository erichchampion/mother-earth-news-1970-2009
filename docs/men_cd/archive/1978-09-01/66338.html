                <p>      If you're one of the nearly fifty percent of all Americans      who live less than an hour's drive from salt water, you may      never have to buy seafood again!    </p>    <p>      Louis Bignam:    </p>            <p>      Mmmm-MMMMI Clam chowder so rich that you can almost eat the      steam . . . mussels delicate enough in flavor to shame the      adjectives that are normally used to describe tastes ....    </p>    <p>      Is this the bill of fare for a $30 dinner? Nope, these      fancy foods are available "free for the takin' " to almost      anyone within foraging range of an ocean . . . and it won't      take days of digging to fill your kettle, either.    </p>    <p>      Best of all, no expensive equipment is necessary to harvest      your share of this seafood bounty. A good field guide (the      bible on this subject is still Stalking the Blue-Eyed      Scallop by Euell Gibbons), a desire to spend the day      surrounded by the sounds and smells of the beach, and a      willingness to brave water, mud, and rocks . . . will just      about do to get you started.    </p>    <p>      Since the variety of Seafoods that can be gathered easily      is great-and since the methods of collection differ      from one critter to the next-it would be dang-nigh      impossible to describe everything about this particular      brand of wild food foraging in just one article. So, I'll      tell you what my years of experience (and countless marine      biology courses) have taught me about tidal foraging in      this issue of MOTHER . . . and save the deeper water      species for the next. But let's not waste time gabbin' when      the sacks are empty!    </p>        <h3>      THE BOUNTIFUL BIVALVES    </h3>    <p>      Bivalves-mollusks with two hinged shells-make      up the bulk of my seashore scavengings ... simply because      they're readily available and are awfully fine eating. Even      if you're a novice forager, you can fill your belly without      difficulty on your first trip out if you concentrate on      this large group of edibles.    </p>    <p>      Before we get down to specifics, however, a few words of      caution are in order: Most mollusks feed by siphoning In      water and straining out and absorbing the small bits of      food (or anything else) that they happen to suck in with      the liquid. Which, unfortunately, means that-where      man has contaminated the water-these creatures can      become tiny storehouses of poison. ALWAYS MAKE SURE OF ITS      WATER PURITY THROUGH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT BEFORE      COLLECTING AND EATING BIVALVES FROM ANY BEACH, TIDAL FLAT,      ETC.    </p>    <p>      A call to the Fish and Game Department in the area-to      determine seasons, size and bag limits, and license      needs-is also a good idea. Local sporting goods      stores can sell you a permit (if one is needed). They      usually can e supply you with a yearly tide table, too . .      . which will help you plan your expeditions around the      prime foraging times (from two hours before low tide till      two hours after).    </p>    <p>      Finally, NEVER EAT ANY SHELLFISH THAT ISN'T UNQUESTIONABLY      FRESH. A general rule is to discard each and every bivalve      that doesn't resist your efforts to open its shell, or that      doesn't close itself more tightly when touched.    </p>    <h3>      MUSSELS    </h3>    <p>      O.K., now that you've checked the purity of the water in      your area, protected yourself against the game warden, and      promised not to eat anything that wasn't alive when you      found it . . . you're probably eager to start fillin' up      that of collection bag. And the quickest way to make the      sack bulge is with a passel of mussels.    </p>    <p>      Members of the genera Mytilus and Modiolus-mussels of      one variety or another-can be found along just about      any portion of the North American coastline . . . east or      west. Westerners should limit their gathering to a season      running from November through April, since-during the      rest of the year-the bivalves found in their area may      ingest microscopic dinoflagellates which can cause illness      in humans. And the old rule of thumb-only harvest      shellfish during months that contain an "r"-should do      quite nicely for folks on the East Coast.    </p>    <p>      Once the season begins, a sharpened tire iron or heavy      bladed knife and a gunnysack (I prefer a backpack lined      with a plastic bag . . . it keeps my hands free) will be      all the tools you'll need to go musselin'.    </p>    <p>      Finding yourself a bed of delicious mollusks to dig into      Should present no problem, either. Just locate a rocky area      near the low tide line and-if mussels are present-you'll be      hard pressed not to walk on 'em. My favorite "gatherin'      grounds" are upwards of a half mile long and composed of      clusters of tasty shellfish packed together like mosaic      tiles!    </p>    <p>      Obviously with colonies of this size and density, it's an      easy matter to pry off enough (a dozen apiece will do for      most folks, two dozen will satisfy even the most voracious      consumer of seafood) for your eatin' needs.    </p>    <p>      And while you're foraging up those mussels, have a look      around the rocks for a clump of the long-stemmed,      white-shelled goose barnacles whichthough they look like a      cross between a mushroom and a gander-are closely related      to crabs. These bizarre creatures (of the genus Mitella on      the West Coast and Lepas in the Atlantic) are lobster-like      in flavor and as easy as pie to collect. I just scrape the      black stems off of their rocky perches . . . and try for a      compromise between getting the maximum amount of stalk with      the minimum of grit and sand!    </p>    <p>      I steam most of my catch right on the beach in a 30-gallon      army surplus kettle, and the barnacles get popped into the      water right along with my day's mussel harvest. Their      white-shelled tops can be discarded after steaming, the      stems cut open, and finger-sized pieces of meat pried out.      Furthermore, since the taste of these dainties Is akin to      that of the clawed crustaceans, goose barnacles can be      substituted in any recipe that calls for crab or lobster.    </p>    <p>      Those patches of gravel surrounding the masses of stone      (which harbored the barnacles) should be foraged too:      They're often the homes of small clams and of several types      of mollusks called cockles.    </p>    <p>      That last name, by the way, probably should be clarified at      least a little before we proceed any further: On the      eastern seaboard "cockle" usually refers-more or less      accurately-to members of the genus Cardium. On the      Pacific Shore, however, the same term is applied to      mollusks of at least four different genera. This confusion      is seldom a problem, though, because in local usage      "cockle" most often seems to translate as "good eatin'      clam". See what the area's residents gather, double check      with your field guide (local prejudices often cause folks      to ignore delicious shellfish), then have a go at the      little bivalves on your own.    </p>    <p>      You'll be thankful (as many a sore-backed digger has been)      that cockles have no breathing siphons at all . . . and,      because of this inconvenience (to them), must limit their      belowground travel to within an inch or two of the sand's      surface. A clam rake, hoe, or shovel should be the only      tool you'll need to gather the tasty little rascals . . .      however, due to the rocky nature of the sand in which      cockles are generally found, even a small amount of digging      will be anything but easy. (Remember, too-after you      straighten out the kinks and leave the seaside for the      day-that a freshwater rinse will greatly extend the      life of your foraging equipment. Perhaps it'll make you      feel better, too!)    </p>    <h3>      THE WEST COAST'S LARGE, ECONOMY-SIZED CLAMS    </h3>    <p>      The Pacific Ocean is a powerful big body of water, and some      of the clams that inhabit its North American coastline are      nothing less than giants. The most common of these      monsters-found in mud and sand flats from Alaska to      San Diego-is the horse clam (Schizothaerus nuttalll).    </p>    <p>      It isn't necessary to wait for a particularly low tide to      snare a few of these whoppers (they run all the way up to      four pounds each). The only real job-after you sight      the spouts from their squirt holes between the low and high      water marks-is diggin' 'em out . . . since even when      they're spraying water three feet into the air, these clams      may well be buried another yard deep !n the sand. Dig the      giants out anyway. When properly cleaned and prepared,      they're more than worth the effort.    </p>    <p>      I've found that the flavor of horse clams-and that of      other bivalves found in muddy sand-can be improved by      storing the shellfish alive in a large, shaded tub of      seawater (or in a cage sunk beneath the surface of the      ocean itself) for about 48 hours. If you then add cornmeal      to the water, you'll fool the critters into replacing any      slit in their bodies with the grain. This simple treatment      will make most any bivalve taste better, and has let me      enjoy some species that the local diggers thought inedible.    </p>    <p>      No discussion of clams (at least here in California) would      be complete without a mention of the gismo. This, the      Golden State's most famous mollusk (the shellfish is a      tourist attraction !n its own right), is found in open      sandy areas from Half Moon Bay, near San Francisco, all the      way down to southern Mexico. Believe !t or not, the gismo      clam (genus Tivela) supports an entire digging industry ...      complete with chauffeured boat rides to prime beaches and      shoreside equipment rentals. Unfortunately, the gismo's      population-despite rigid size and bag limits-is      on the decline in popular clamming areas. It should be      looked upon as a special occasional treat, then, rather      than a reliable source of wild food. Better yet,      concentrate on the more common varieties of bivalves and      thus do your bit toward giving this surf dweller a chance      to reestablish itself.    </p>    <h3>      ON THE WAY TO THE TABLE    </h3>    <p>      As I've already noted, I generally steam a large percentage      of the seafood I forage alongshore within yards of where I      find it. I chow down my fill right on the spot, and pack      the remainder of the cooked meat in single dinner-sized      plastic bags . . . ready for the freezer and future soups      and chowders.    </p>    <p>      As you probably know, steaming is the simplest form of      seafood cookery imaginable. A little water (or perhaps some      white wine for a flavor treat)-just enough to cover      the bottom of the pot and not boil completely away . . .      certainly not enough to cover the food that's being      prepared-in a kettle with a close-fitting lid are all      you need to do the job. Clams and mussels will be done when      the shells open wide (after approximately twenty minutes of      steaming) ... and barnacles will be ready when the clams      are. I always take along a couple loaves of French bread      when these cookouts become group parties . . . a pound or      two of butter ... and sufficient wine to wash everything      down. What could be simpler? Or tastier?    </p>    <p>      Still, that's only the most basic form of shellfish      preparation . . . and a little variety can be welcome from      time to time (especially if you forage the beaches as often      as I do). The following recipes from the book Stalking the      Blue-Eyed Scallop by Euell Gibbons (available for $3.95      plus 95 cents shipping and handling from Mother's      Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina      28739) are reprinted here with the permission of the David      McKay Co., Inc., and should satisfy the most discriminating      epicureans:    </p>    <h3>      CLAM CHOWDER    </h3>    <p>      Cut 1 large onion and about 4 slices of bacon into small      bits and fry them together until the onion is golden yellow      and translucent. Then add 2 cups of diced potatoes, cover      everything with water, and boll until the spuds are done.      While the potatoes are still cooking steam 2 dozen clams      (more or less, depending upon their size and how many you      have) and-after steaming-grind their meat in a food      chopper. This clam meat and broth from the steaming kettle      are then added to the chowder. Immediately pour in a quart      of milk, 1 teaspoon of monosodium glutamate (I don't know      why Gibbons used this seasoning, but he did . . . leave it      out if you want to), and 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground      black pepper. While the mixture is heating (only to a      simmer), blend 1 tablespoon of flour into 1/4 cup of milk,      slowly add the solution to the chowder, and continue to      stir until the soup slightly thickens. Try to avoid boiling      the rich brew after the milk has been added, but do simmer      it gently for 10 minutes after adding the thickening. Serve      the steaming chowder (ambrosia!) with crackers on the side.    </p>    <h3>      STUFFED MUSSELS    </h3>    <p>      Scrub (with a stiff vegetable brush or its equivalent) and      steam open 4 dozen mussels, remove their meat, and chop it      into coarse bits. Then dice one medium-sized onion and      saute it in butter until it turns a clear yellow. Add 1      tablespoon of chopped parsley, 1/4 teaspoon of poultry      seasoning, and 1-1/2 cups of bread crumbs. Cook the mixture      (stirring it constantly) for about 2 minutes before      removing it from the heat.    </p>    <p>      After you've taken the pot off the fire, stir In the      chopped mussels and enough of the broth from the steaming      kettle to dampen the bread crumbs slightly.      And-finally-mix everything together, fill 2      dozen of the empty half-shells with the mixture, arrange      the shells on a cookie sheet, and put them in the broiler      until the tops of the stuffing have lightly browned. Then      serve up the stuffed mussels while they're still sizzling!    </p>    <h3>      GOOSE BARNACLES NEWBURG    </h3>    <p>      If you want an absolutely perfect Barnacle Newberg, you      have to prepare it in a double boiler. First, put the top      (only) of the boiler over a low direct heat and use It to      melt 1 tablespoon of butter. Then blend 1 tablespoon of      flour into the butter. When this mixture has started to      brown, set the double boiler top on its bottom section and      finish cooking the blend over boiling water. Next add 1 cup      of coffee cream and 2 or 3 dozen steamed barnacle stems      (depending on their size). Cook for 10 minutes, add 2      wellbeaten egg yolks, and then cook and stir for another 2      minutes. Finally, add 1 /2 teaspoon of salt, a tiny pinch      of cayenne, and 2 tablespoons of cooking sherry. Stir well      again, and serve over toast. A bottle of dry white wine      will go very well with this dish.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For more Information about foraging seafood,      See MOTHER N0.14, pages 74-83 and MOTHER N0. 48, pages      88-90.
