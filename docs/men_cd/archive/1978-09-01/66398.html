    <p>
                        <p>      A couple of years ago-when she started to buy a      little teenie can of prepared pizza sauce in a      supermarket-Barryton, Michigan's Carolyn Allen was      floored by the tiny container's giant price.    </p>    <p>      "So I decided to make my own pizza sauce from my own      homegrown produce during the following canning season,"      Carolyn now says. "It took a bit of experimenting to come      up with just the right amount of all the ingredients . . .      but I finally hit upon a blend that the folks around here      seem to relish. The secret is the herbs: Don't be afraid to      put more of 'em in than you think you shouldl That's what      gives my sauce its hearty flavor and character."    </p>    <h3>      CAROLYN ALLEN'S "SCRATCH" PIZZA SAUCE . . .    </h3>    <p>      Mix 12 to 14 pounds of cored and skinned fresh or      home-canned tomatoes together with one pound (two cups) of      chopped celery, three cups of chopped onions, three chopped      green peppers, one or two finely chopped cloves of garlic,      and either one-quarter cup of Italian seasoning or two      tablespoons of oregano, one tablespoon of basil, and one      tablespoon of thyme. (If you like, you can also add one to      one and a half cups of finely diced summer squash. It won't      change the taste but the squash will extend the sauce and      make it thicken more quickly.)    </p>    <p>      Simmer all these ingredients together over a low heat for      two to three hours, or until the mixture has cooked into a      thick, savory richness. Then cool the sauce, pour it into      one-pint freezing cartons (it should fill about eight of      them), and freeze .    </p>    <h3>      . . .JUST NATURALLY GOES WITH CO-OP CHEESE . . .    </h3>    <p>      "I also prepackage cheese and sausage for my homemade      pizzas," Carolyn goes on. "We buy the cheese in six-pound      blocks from a food co-op and I shred it with my salad maker      and stash it away in the freezer in one-pint cartons. When      we thaw it later and use it, it's every bit as good as (but      far less expensive than) the costly little packets of      shredded cheese sold in the supermarkets.    </p>    <p>      "The same goes for the sausage. I buy it freshly ground and      seasoned-but with absolutely no unwanted      preservatives added-from a local butcher shop, and      freeze it (three-quarters of a pound per container) in pint      cartons."    </p>    <h3>      .. . AND "SCRATCH" PIZZA CRUST!    </h3>    <p>      "I like to prepare dough ahead for pizza crusts too,"      Carolyn says. "Whenever I bake loaves of whole wheat,      anadama, herb, or other breads . . . I just mix up a little      extra, package the dough in onepound lots, and freeze it      right alongside my other ingredients. Then-when pizza      day rolls around-all I have to do is go to the      freezer and select one container of crust, one sauce, one      sausage, and one cheese . . . thaw everything . . . roll      out the dough and spread on the sauce, sausage, and cheese      . . . bake my creation at 450°F for about 15 minutes or      until the cheese is slightly browned . . . and 'serve 'er      up' to a hungry family of four."    </p>    <h3>      THE IDEA WORKS FOR MOTHER TOO!    </h3>    <p>      Well, that whole idea sounded so good when Carolyn Allen      described it, that MOTHER's recipe testers decided they'd      give it a try too. So they mixed, simmered, and froze a      batch of their own pizza sauce from summer vegetables . . .      grated some cheese . . . bought some fresh sausage from a      little country butcher shop . . . and worked up and froze a      batch of pizza dough.    </p>    <p>      Actually, MOTHER's dough was essentially the Tassajara      Yeasted Bread-a big favorite around      here-featured in The Tassajara Bread Book (a 1970      Shambhala book by Edward Espe Brown, available in paperback      for $3.95 from any good bookstore or $3.95 plus 95 cents      shipping and handling from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hender sonville, North Carolina 28739).    </p>    <p>      Dissolve two packages of dry yeast in three cups of      lukewarm water (sprinkle some on your wrist to test its      temperature), and then stir in one-quarter cup of honey.      Next add four cups of whole wheat flour-or three cups      of whole wheat and one cup of unbleached flour-and      stir until you have a thick batter. Beat the mixture about      100 strokes with a spoon and set it aside to rise for an      hour.    </p>    <p>      At the end of the hour gently stir in one and one-quarter      tablespoons of salt and one-third cup of vegetable oil.      Then add three to four more cups of whole wheat flour (keep      adding until the dough sticks together in a sponge that      pulls away from the sides of the bowl), and knead the dough      on a floured surface. Use as much additional flour-up      to one or one and a half cups-as necessary to keep      the sponge from sticking while you knead it for 10 to 15      minutes (until the dough becomes smooth).    </p>    <p>      Place the sponge in a large oiled bowl, cover it with a      damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 50      minutes. Then-using your fist-gently punch it      down to slightly larger than it was an hour before, cover      the sponge again, and let it rise another 40 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Finally, shape the dough into two loaves, put one into a      greased bread pan, cover, let it rise for another 20      minutes (until the center of the loaf has risen up even      with the top of the pan), and bake at 350°F for about      an hour . . . or until the loaf is golden-brown all over      and sounds hollow when you tap it on the bottom. Turn the      bread out of its pan and let it cool awhile on a wire rack.    </p>    <p>      In the meantime, divide the other loaf in half . . . and      freeze each piece in a pint container (for later use as the      crusts of two pizzas).    </p>    <h3>      TA DA! "INSTANT" ALL-NATURAL PIZZA!    </h3>    <p>      Then when-as Carolyn Allen says-"pizza day      rolls around" at your house, you can (as Ms. Allen and      MOTHER now do) pull a container of dough and one each of      sauce, grated cheese, and sausage out of your freezer.    </p>    <p>      Butter or oil your hands and the pizza pan (or cookie      sheet) you intend to use. Then place the lump of thawed      dough in the container's center and gently flatten and      spread it with your fingers until it covers the pan as      smoothly as possible. (Don't leave any holes or tears in      the dough, or the sauce will cook through and burn.)      And-if you prefer a crispy crust-now's the time      to bake the bare dough a quick 5 to 10 minutes at 450°F      before you load it with the sauce, sausage, and cheese.    </p>    <p>      Next spread a thawed container of your homemade pizza sauce      smoothly and evenly over-but not quite all the way      out to the edges of-the dough (either prebaked or      unbaked). Then spread on the thawed sausage-fry it in      a skillet first, drain it, and then sprinkle it on if you      prefer less grease in your pizza-and grated cheese      (some folks like mozzarella, others swear by Colby, and      still others insist on Parmesan or a different favorite yet      . . . let your own taste buds decide).    </p>    <p>      Last but not least, slip your delectable creation into a      450°F oven and bake it for about 15 minutes, or until      the crust is a beautiful golden-brown and the cheese is      melted and bubbly.    </p>    <p>      This recipe feeds four. Or, maybe, on an autumn evening      when there's a threat of winter in the air. . . it may only      feed two or three. In other words, fix plenty? Folks just      never seem to know when to stop eating this wholesome,      all-natural, do-it-yourself pizzal    </p>
