                    <p>      <strong>How to start a backyard nursery.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Michael J. McGroarty    </h5>        <p>      <strong>G</strong>rowing plants for retail or wholesale is      an interesting and fun way to earn money while involving      the whole family. You don't need much land (our backyard      nursery is only 1/20 of an acre), you can grow thousands of      plants at a time, and you earn several thousand dollars a      year... working right at home    </p>    <p>      Starting a nursery in your backyard is probably easier than      you think. When most people think of a plant nursery they      visualize huge greenhouses, tractors and other expensive      equipment. The fact is, as a backyard grower you don't need      any of those things to get started. All you need is a small      area to start growing some plants and a little bit of      information on landscape plant propagation. Thankfully,      there are many simple and easy propagation techniques that      are easy to learn and work really well.    </p>    <h3>      PROPAGATING TECHNIQUES    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Seeds</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the local wholesale nursery owners in our area has      been buying our plants for years. She grows thousands of      her own plants, but at times local demand outweighs her      supply, so she buys from us, marks up the price a little,      and takes care of her customers. Usually she goes for the      white, pink and Chinese dogwoods we grow.    </p>    <p>      As it turns out, white and Chinese dogwoods are quite easy      to grow from seed, and you should plant them as soon as      they're ripe and start falling from the trees in September.      Collect the seeds and soak them in water for about a week,      then squeeze them between your fingers to separate the      pulp. Put the seeds in a pail filled with water so that      they sink to the bottom, leaving the pulp on top to be      washed away when the water starts to overflow. Afterward,      fill a kitchen blender halfway with water and slowly add      the seeds, allowing them to churn for a minute or so (run      the blender at a slow speed, just fast enough to keep the      mixture turning). This process nicks the hard outer shell      of the seeds, allowing water and oxygen to penetrate the      husks and trigger the germination process.    </p>    <p>      Dry the seeds and immediately sow them on top of a bed of      weed-free topsoil. Cover the seeds with approximately 3/16      inches of soil (not too deep!). Then, cover the bed with      hardware cloth or screen to keep birds and small animals      from eating the seeds. At the first sign of germination in      the spring, remove the screen.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly, seeds collected from a pink dogwood are      likely to flower white, and most of the time the accepted      method for producing pink dogwoods involves grafting a bud      or a small twig from a pink tree onto a white dogwood      seedling. The introduction of "intermittent mist," however,      has made it possible to root pink dogwood cuttings on their      own. Intermittent mist is an automatic watering system that      applies a fine spray of water to cuttings every few minutes      during daylight hours. As an example, we just planted      several thousand cuttings last week and have them under      intermittent mist. They receive a 12-second spray of water      every ten minutes starting at 9:00 a.m. and ending at 7:30      p.m. Some of them will be rooted in two weeks; almost all      of them will be rooted in six weeks. It's a fairly simple      system, but it requires a timer, a transformer, and an      electric solenoid valve to control the watering cycle. The      investment can be around $360 if you buy a system, or about      $225 if you build your own. This is something you might      want to consider once your nursery is making a fair profit.      In the meantime there are many other plants with      inexpensive propagation techniques that you can use.    </p>    <h3>      Layering    </h3>    <p>      Flowering shrubs are very popular and are quite easy to      propagate. When we have a retail sale, any plant that has a      bloom on it sells immediately. We grow forsythia, weigela,      potentilla, purple sandcherry, rose of Sharon, viburnums,      flowering almond, hydrangea and spirea by using an easy      growing technique called "layering."    </p>        <p>      Layering is a simple process often used to propagate      flowering shrubs. All you do is dig a little hole next to      the shrub that you would like to propagate and pull a      branch from the shrub into the hole, gently bending it in a      "U" shape so that the bottom curve of the "U" is under      ground. Cover the hole completely with soil, packing it      tightly so that the branch doesn't pop out. You're left      with one end of the branch still attached to the parent      plant and the other end sticking up out of the ground. The      plant will root from the middle of the buried branch.    </p>        <p>      According to local lore, wholesale growers would plant      hundreds of plants in large square "layering blocks." Each      spring they would layer every branch on every plant, then      come back the following spring, remove the new layers, and      line them out in the field to grow. After the layers were      removed, the parent plants looked like stumps. They were,      however, living, viable plants that would put on fresh new      growth for layering the next year. These growers always had      two layering blocks - one ready to be layered and the other      to be harvested.    </p>    <p>      Layering is a foolproof technique because the cutting you      root is still attached to the parent plant, which prevents      it from failing as easily as cuttings that have been      completely removed. You can increase the odds of layered      plants taking root by "wounding" the plant at the point      that is buried (to "wound" a plant, simply scrape the bark      off just one side of the stem) and applying a rooting      compound to the wound. Rooting compounds are available at      most full-service garden centers and through many      mail-order catalogs. They come in both powder and liquid      formula and in varying strengths, for softwood or hardwood      cuttings. I prefer the liquid formula because you control      the strength of the solution by adding water yourself.    </p>    <p>      By fall the layered plants should be rooted and can be      transplanted to your nursery once they are dormant for the      winter. They are not dormant until after they've undergone      a hard freeze.    </p>    <h3>      Cuttings    </h3>    <p>      Evergreens are great plants (and great sellers!) that are      grown from cuttings. The easiest ones to grow are taxus,      juniper and arborvitae. We skip the taxus evergreens      because they are slow to mature. We like to grow plants      that we can turn over quickly, but we do grow and sell      thousands of arborvitae and juniper evergreens. We've found      the best way to grow them is in a propagation box.    </p>    <p>      Build a propagation box using 2x8s just like you would if      you were building a kid's sandbox - a square frame with no      bottom or top. Place the box in an area that receives about      50% sunlight and remove all vegetation from the area inside      the frame before filling it with coarse sand. Coarse sand      is the type used when mixing concrete (unlike fine-grained      masonry sand) because the particles are larger and provide      better drainage in the propagation box. Fill the box      completely, leaving some extra on top in case the sand      settles. When you're ready to start sticking cuttings in      the box, level the sand and strike off the excess.    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind that this type of propagation is a technique      to be used in the autumn. Some nurseries even wait until      after Thanksgiving to plant, but we have experienced      success as early as September.    </p>    <p>      To make evergreen cuttings, all you do is clip off the tips      of the branches, making each cutting about six inches long.      Then, remove the needles from the bottom two-thirds of the      cuttings, dip them in a rooting compound and, using a putty      knife and a straight edge, make a slice in the sand the      width of the propagation bed. Now you can stick the      branches in the opening one inch deep and about one inch      apart from each other. Insert the next row about two inches      from the first. Immediately after planting, water      thoroughly so that the sand will settle around the cuttings      and eliminate any air pockets.    </p>    <p>      After you get the plants in the ground, water them a couple      of times a week until the weather turns cold. Once you've      experienced a hard freeze, the cuttings become dormant      until spring and will need very little care. Just water      them when you experience warm or dry weather. It's a slow      technique, but it works. When spring rolls around you      should start watering on a regular basis, and by the next      fall the cuttings should be rooted and can be transplanted      to your nursery.    </p>        <h3>      SELLING WHAT YOU GROW    </h3>    <p>      Here in the far northeastern corner of Ohio we have more      than 100 nurseries, ranging in size from our 1/20 of an      acre to much larger ones measuring 600 acres. Many of these      nurseries were called "lunchbox" nurseries, a term that      dates from the early 1900s when employees of one large      wholesale nursery would smuggle cuttings home in their      lunch boxes to start their own backyard nurseries. Many of      these startups grew into very productive and profitable      enterprises.    </p>    <p>      When you're ready to sell the plants you grow, there are      many different ways to go about it. We grow most of our      plants in small containers and sell them for $4 each. It      costs us about 23  cents to produce one of these little      plants, and most of that cost is the plastic container-the      cost of the plant is next to nothing. We spend $10 on sand,      $20 on rooting compound, and can do 7,000 cuttings or more      with these materials, which brings the cost per cutting to      less than a penny. As close as I can figure, our cost for      the potting soil is about 5  cents for a two-quart      container. The cost of the plastic container is around 16       cents. A small ad in the local paper brings in customers      like crazy and, because we're lucky enough to live in a      community that allows us to sell directly from our home, we      sell both wholesale and retail from our backyard nursery.    </p>    <p>      If you can't do retail sales from home, you should still be      able to establish a wholesale business. Large wholesale      nurseries spend thousands of dollars each year buying      plants they need. Some of them buy rooted cuttings while      others buy landscape-size plants. Whatever the case, they      will buy from you if you offer good-quality plants at fair      prices.    </p>    <p>      You could even have a backyard nursery specializing only in      rooted cuttings. A four-inch cutting with roots has value      on the market, and there are wholesale buyers who purchase      thousands of them at a time. Rooted cuttings sell for as      little as 35  cents or as much as $1.25, depending on the      variety. If you grow the plants for one year after they are      rooted you can sell them wholesale as      one-a-year-transplants, which increases the price to $1.50      or more. There is a market for just about any size plant      you choose to grow - and the market is larger than you      could ever imagine.    </p>    <p>      I have a friend who roots and sells grapevines as one- and      two-year-old plants. At his 100-acre nursery they make over      500,000 grapevine cuttings each winter, as well as tens of      thousands of flowering shrub cuttings every summer. He      grows about 100,000 burning bush plants each year and sells      them bare root, which is much easier and less expensive      than wrapping up a root ball in burlap. After digging the      plants up, they shake all the soil from the roots, tie them      in bundles of ten, and stack them in an insulated barn      until it's time to load them on their customer's truck. The      nursery's annual sales exceed 2 million dollars!    </p>    <p>      That said, the backyard nursery business is not a      get-rich-quick business by any means. It takes many years      to establish a large nursery. On the other hand, it's a      project that you can start with very little money and      expand into a thriving home business. In fact, getting      started is as easy as deciding what types of plants you      would like to grow and acquiring a few that you can use as      stock plants to get cuttings from. You'll also need a      nursery stock producer and/or vendor license from your      state department of agriculture. There is a small fee for      the license, but you should contact your county department      of commerce for local regulations and information.    </p>    <p>      Also, you need to know that some plants are patented or are      sold under names that are registered trademarks. You cannot      grow these plants without entering into an agreement with      the person or company that holds the right to them. Don't      bother growing these plants; there are plenty of others      that you can grow without the hassles. When you go to buy      them, just look for a patent number, or "patent pending" on      the label or keep an eye out for the trademark symbol      (restricted). Lastly, make sure you know both the correct common      name and botanical name of the plants you intend to grow.      You must have them properly labeled in order to sell them.      Good luck and have fun!    </p>    <p>      <em>Michael J.
