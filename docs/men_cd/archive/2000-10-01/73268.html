                    <p>      <strong>Age-old remedies for stress.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Dr. Sharon L. Hagemann NMD, DO    </h5>        <p>      <strong><em>Love, Laugh, Let Go.</em></strong> <em>Putting      too much pressure on</em> <em>yourself only creates      more</em> <em>tension. Don't judge yourself</em> <em>too      harshly, or expect more</em> <em>of yourself than you      expect</em> <em>of others. Instead, accept</em>      <em>yourself and your faults.</em> <em>Research      demonstrates that</em> <em>those who take things in      stride</em> <em>have higher self-esteem and</em> <em>less      stress - which translates</em> <em>into better health.</em>    </p>        <p>      Research into the physiological effects of stress has      revealed a series of reactions known collectively as the      General Adaptation Syndrome. Alarm reaction, the response      that first occurs when you're faced with a perceived      emotional or physical threat, results in a rise in blood      pressure, an increased heartbeat, and a general      mobilization of your body's defensive forces.<br />    </p>    <p>      The alarm reaction stage is followed by the resistance      stage, which comes when you've adapted to the threat and      your symptoms - sweaty palms, clenched jaw - begin to      improve or disappear. Luckily, most physical and emotional      stress situations are contained within these two stages.      However, a third response, known as the exhaustion stage,      will set in if you regularly feel anxious over a prolonged      period of time. A constant battle with stress will cause      alarm reaction symptoms to reappear. If the stress      continues unabated, health problems such as hypertension,      chronic anxiety and even heart attack can ensue.    </p>    <h3>      Mountains Out of Molehills    </h3>    <p>      An obvious and daunting fact about stress is that it has      less to do with external factors (your car breaking clown,      your kids bickering) than with your very conscious reaction      to these events. In other words, we are in charge of our      own stress levels.    </p>    <p>      Different situations trigger stress in different people.      For instance, your co-worker might cringe at the thought of      giving a lecture in front of a large audience, while you      might jump at the chance. Likewise, one person will relish      an active schedule full of challenges, while another will      prefer quieter, more predictable pursuits. Switch these two      types of people and each would feel stressed in the other      one's shoes.    </p>    <p>      Another fact we often overlook is that stress can come from      <em>good</em> occasions as well as <em>bad</em> ones. Even      happy events such as a wedding, a promotion or the birth of      a new baby can prove stressful. The anticipation and      excitement of added responsibility that comes with positive      growth and change can cause just as many migraine headaches      and stomach jitters as a <em>bad</em> event, such as a tax      audit. Again, the way the situation affects your health and      well-being depends largely on how you react.    </p>    <p>      Modify your responses to life's events and you'll feel more      calm and in control, even though applying the brakes,      taking a deep breath and getting centered as the rest of      the world accelerates is much easier said than done. With a      little practice, though, you can do it - and you'll      appreciate your newfound sense of calm the next time you're      faced with a crisis. Try these simple, everyday      stress-reducing habits I've included here. I recommend      these tips to patients who find their lives getting out of      control. If these tips work well for you, you might      consider deepening your relaxation response by using      mind-body techniques such as yoga and meditation.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Create Your Own Rituals.</strong> Savor a cup      of chamomile tea in the late afternoon. Light some jasmine      incense and a candle during bathtime. Making space in your      schedule,for simple rituals can go along way in easing      stress. No matter how hectic life may be, you'll find      comfort in knowing that at least some things remain      sacred.</em>    </p>    <p>      H erbal treatments can also help balance body and soul.      Some of these plants target physical ailments, while others      address psychological concerns. For example, if you are      under extreme pressure, your heart races and you feel short      of breath, you might find relief in motherwort, a natural      tranquilizer. If stress ties you in knots and nauseates      you, try fennel or lemon balm. Tense, sore muscles      generally respond favorably to cramp bark. Feverfew and      willow bark work well for migraine and tension headaches.      If it's sleep that's eluding you, passion flower or      scullcap might just do the trick. And should you find      yourself stressed out and depressed, reach for St. John's      Wort, a natural antidepressant.    </p>    <p>      The following, in a nutshell, is information on some      popular and effective herbal stress-relievers.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Get</strong></em>      <strong><em>Silly.</em></strong> <em>Laughter increases      blood flow to the brain, raises endorphin levels, and      lowers levels of stress hormones. Plus, doing it just feels      great. When you're feeling down, call up a friend who never      fails to make you laugh. It really is the best      medicine.</em>    </p>        <p>      Although all of these herbs are safe, you may wish to      confer with a qualified herbalist or natural health care      provider to see which ones are best suited to your      particular needs and situation. He or she may also have      additional suggestions to help you deal with long-term      stress in your life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE HERBS</strong> <strong>CRAMP</strong>      <strong>BARK <em>(Viburnum opulus)</em></strong> While      commonly called "high cranberry," this plant is in no sense      related to the edible cran berry fit belongs to the elder      family). Cramp bark acts as a muscle relaxant, making it      beneficial for elite athletes and hardworking gardeners      alike.    </p>    <p>      Preparation: Recommended in extract form (40 drops, four      times per day). It usually works within 30 minutes.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>R eap Your Rewards.</strong> Rewards for your      hard work needn't be expensive - just something -      pleasurable to look forward to. Buy yourself some flowers      or take a garden stroll at the end of a long day. Or      celebrate your job promotion at the ice cream parlor with      friends.</em>    </p>    <h3>      FENNEL<em>(Foeniculum vulgare)</em>    </h3>        <p>      A favorite in the herbal healing arena from the time of the      pharaohs to the present day, fennel gently relieves      gastrointestinal upsets, flatulence, abdominal tension and      colic.    </p>    <p>      Preparation: Take in capsule form (one to three times      daily) or by extract (40 drops after meals). You'll notice      relief from gas or nausea within half an hour of ingestion.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note. Since, fennel has an estrogenic effect, women      advised by their doctors not to take birth control pills      should avoid the herb in medicinal amounts.</em><br />    </p>    <h3>      FEVERFEW<em>(Chrysanthemum parthenium)</em>    </h3>        <p>      This ancient herb had all but fallen out of use until the      late 1970s, when scientific trials established its validity      as a "modern miracle" for the relief of migraine headaches.    </p>    <p>      Preparation: Take three capsules, three times daily.      Serious migraine sufferers may find it takes several months      to achieve maximum effectiveness.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note: Some people develop mouth sores and nausea using,      feverfew. It should also be avoided during pregnancy.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Make Time For Meals.</em></strong> <em>Eating      at your desk or on-the-go is</em> <em>a ready-made recipe.      for</em> <em>heartburn and mental fatigue.</em> <em>Take      time out to nourish and</em> <em>replenish your body, no      matter</em> <em>how long your to-do list might</em> <em>be      that day.</em>    </p>        <h3>      LEMON BALM<em>(Melissa officinalis)</em>    </h3>    <p>      Medieval Europeans used lemon balm to allay nervousness and      anxiety. More recently, researchers have discovered that      lemon balm oil appears to have mild tranquilizing      properties, substantiating its use as a mild sedative.    </p>    <p>      Preparation: Make an infusion by steeping two teaspoons of      the herb in eight ounces of water in a covered container      for 20 minutes. Administer up to four times per day. The      effects are cumulative and should be felt after a week's      worth of treatment.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Learn from Children</em></strong> <em>"Take      five" and watch some</em> <em>small children at play.</em>      <em>They're enjoying the moment</em> <em>and aren't worried      about the</em> <em>past or future. Try following</em>      <em>their example.</em>    </p>    <h3>      MOTHERWORT <em>(Leonorus cardiaca</em> )    </h3>    <p>      The ancient Greeks and Romans prescribed motherwort for      both palpitations and depression. Contemporary herbalists      recognize its use as a mild sedative and anxiety-reducer.    </p>    <p>      Preparation: I recommend a tincture, because the herb is      extremely bitter. Take one-half to one teaspoon, twice a      day (effective within a week). Severe anxiety responds best      to regular use over a one-month period.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note: Motherwort has been shown to suppress thyroid      function in large doses.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Find A Hobby.</em></strong> <em>Do something      purely for the fun of it. Gather coins from foreign lands,      make scented candles, or put on a pair of cross-country      skis and see where they take you. Indulge in something that      makes your heart sing.</em>    </p>        <h3>      PASSION FLOWER<em>(Passiflora incarnata)</em>    </h3>    <p>      Documented as a tran quilizer and sedative in the National      Formulary from 1916-1936, passion flower acts as a gentle      tranquilizer, pain reliever and digestive aid.<br />      <br />      Preparation: For a relaxing, sleep-inducing infusion, steep      one teaspoon of leaves in a cup of boiling water for 15      minutes. Take one cup at bedtime for insomnia. For general      relaxation, try sipping up to three cups a day.<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Note: Passion flower is generally considered safe,      although extremely large doses may cause nausea and/or      vomiting in some</em> individuals.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Set</em></strong>      <strong><em>Priorities.</em></strong> <em>Devote some      time</em> <em>to think about your life</em> <em>goals. List      your goals for</em> <em>the year, the week and the</em>      <em>day. This should give you a</em> <em>good idea of what      you are</em> <em>really seeking. Always go</em> <em>after      the important things</em> <em>first, and be open to</em>      <em>the fact that your</em> <em>goals may evolve</em>      <em>over time.</em>    </p>    <h3>      ST. JOHN'S WORT<em>(Hypericum perforatum)</em>    </h3>    <p>      In the Middle Ages, legend stated that this red-relined      plant sprang from the blood of John the Baptist when he was      beheaded. Therefore, it was often blessed by a priest and      worn around the neck to ward off disease and temptation.      Today St. John's Wort is used to relieve anxiety and      restore emotional stability. Its active component,      hypericin, combats depression in the higher centers of the      brain. It is of particular use to those with chronic      anxiety, or to individuals who suffer from panic attacks.    </p>    <p>      Preparation: Take 20 to 30 drops of standardized extract,      four times a day. It is a slow but enduring tranquilizer      that must be used an average of ten days before effects are      noted.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note: This herb can have</em> <em>photo-sensitizing      effect for some users. Avoid exposure to sun during a      course of treatment, as sunburn will quickly result. Also,      contact your health care provider before taking if you      already take prescription antidepressants.</em>    </p>    <h3>      SCULLCAP <em>(Scutellaria lateriflora)</em>    </h3>        <p>      Eclectic American physicians of the 19th century rec      ommended scullcap as a tranquilizer and sedative for      insomnia and nervousness. It relieves mood swings, sleeping      disorders, nervous tension and stress-related headaches.    </p>    <p>      Preparation: Take 30 to 40 drops of fresh plant tincture in      juice or tea up to four times a day. Scullcap works over a      period of several weeks.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note: While there have been no reports of toxicity,      large amounts of tincture may result in confusion,      twitching and convulsions.</em>    </p>    <h3>      WILLOW BARK<em>(Salix alba)</em>    </h3>    <p>      Yet another time-tested "herbal aspirin" (in fact, the      original ingredient in commercial aspirin), white willow      bark is greatly effective in relieving head pain,      particularly tension headaches. It also reduces fever and      inflammations.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Write It Down.</em></strong> <em>Putting pen to      paper can be</em> <em>healthy and cathartic, and</em>      <em>reading over what you have written often helps put      things</em> <em>into perspective. If stress has</em>      <em>you losing sleep, jot down your</em> <em>worries in a      notebook before</em> <em>going to bed. Let them go,      and</em> <em>you won't feel the need to</em> <em>process      them all night</em> <em>in your head.</em>    </p>    <p>      Preparation: Gently boil two teaspoons of herb in eight      ounces of water for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and      steep for an additional 30 minutes; take up to three cups a      day. Or take three capsules three times a day. Willow      bark's effects can generally be felt within two to three      hours.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note: Willow bark contains tannin, which can cause      constipation.</em>    </p>    <p>      For more Herbal Remedies stories, PLUS expanded bulletin      boards and article archives, log on to      <strong>www.motherearthnews.com</strong> and read MOTHER in      cyberspace today!    </p>
