                    <p>      <strong>Root cellars, waterglass<br />      and a better mouse trap.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Dear</em> <em>MOTHER,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We need to store approximately 600</em> <em>pounds of      potatoes. What is the best way</em> <em>to keep them?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Ed T.<br />      Hamilton, IN</em>    </p>    <p>      Potatoes are alive but dormant, awaiting spring to sprout      and grow. Keep them thinking that they're still buried in      the soil and that it's late fall, and they will last      through winter and into spring - longer if you can maintain      their temperature and humidity needs.    </p>    <p>      To do this, you <em>must</em> provide them absolute,      pitch-black dark - a squeak of light makes them think      spring has arrived and they'll start pushing out buds.      Also, they need to be stored at high (95%) humidity and at      a temperature of 38째F to 40째F if they are to be      eaten soon. Reduce temperatures to 34째F to 36째F for      long-term storage (but warm again before eating).    </p>    <p>      Pack loosely in open-slated crates with air passages over,      under and around them to reduce the chance of rot.      Discourage sprouting by leaving apples to spoil in the      storage. The ethylene gas that apples emit encourages fruit      to ripen, but potatoes to remain dormant.    </p>    <p>      Potato pits dug below frost level in the soil and lined      with straw have been used to store potatoes for centuries.      More elaborate root cellars - ranging from storage pits      under a house floor to walk-in rooms dug into a hillside -      were a feature of country life till the advent of      electricity and refrigeration.    </p>    <p>      A deep, unheated cellar under a modern home can be adapted      to maintain potato-storage conditions. You'll need fans to      circulate air, outside windows that can be opened and      closed to maintain proper temperatures during winter, and      electric coolers in summer. A dirt-floored cellar will      maintain humidity naturally. In a concrete-floored cellar,      humidity can be maintained by lining the floor with      water-soaked burlap bags.    </p>    <p>      For more information on growing and storing potatoes, read      roving editor John Vivian's article "The Spud of Life:      Growing Nature's Most Perfect Food," in MEN #172, March      1999.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dear MOTHER,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Issue #48 addressed the long-term storage</em>      <em>of</em> <em>eggs. There was an issue that did a      follow-up to that article, but I can no longer, find it.      Can you give me any update on this subject?</em>    </p><p><em>Charlene A.<br />    Columbia City, IN</em><br /></p>    <p>      Before electric lines got to the farm, the spring deluge of      eggs were stored in waterglass, a thin gel of sterilized      water and powdered sodium silicate that combines to form an      inert, fluid form of glass. Eggs were partitioned by age in      a vat with boiled - wood-slat dividers or grid-bottomed      boxes. They were used on a first-in, first-out basis and      replaced with fresh eggs over the year as production slowed      so none were more than a few months old.    </p>    <p>      You still can preserve eggs in waterglass, which seals them      away from air, bugs and bacteria. If eggs are clean, the      vat of waterglass sterile and everything kept cellar-cool,      they will keep for six months or more. Older eggs will      stiffen and develop an off-balance flavor (a little sulphur      dioxideish), but they can still be used for baking.    </p>    <p>      Some books say not to wash waterglassed eggs so as to      preserve the natural antibacterial coating on the shell.      Though valid for refrigerated fresh eggs, this makes no      sense in waterglass because the protective silica medium      serves that function. Also, chicken droppings can remain on      unwashed eggshells and could introduce bacteria into eggs      within the silica bath.    </p>    <p>      You'll want to keep the vat covered loosely to keep out      dust and cellar creatures. Fishing the eggs out of the      waterglass by hand is beyond icky, so you might want to      invest in some long rubber gloves or tongs. You can get      both, as well as the waterglass, from the homesteading      catalogs (see " Sources ")    </p>    <p>      On general hygiene principles, replace waterglass after a      year. Air out and sun a wooden vat thoroughly, and scour      plastic or metal vats before refilling.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dear MOTHER,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>As a longtime animal lover, 1 have always held to the      firm belief in not killing or harming animals. However, our      garage is overrun with mice, and while we have no problem      with their choice of shelter, we do object to the little      critters chewing on the wiring in our truck. Twice we have      had to have the wiring replaced, and we have to get rid of      the mice. We have two cats and two dogs, and we need a      natural way to rid ourselves of this problem? Any      ideas?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Les</em>    </p>        <p>      Put your cats to work to earn their keep. Teach them that      the garage and the vehicles are part of their home turf,      and are to be defended against vermin. To do this, shut      them in the garage for the night with fresh water, an ample      evening feeding (well-fed cats make the best mousers),      comfy cat beds and a clean litter box. Leave the truck's      doors open; they might sleep on the seat or in the foot      well or, if the weather is cold on the hood or on the      still-warm engine. From these spots they'll be sure to hear      any mice gnawing on the wiring harness. Heap praise on them      for any mouse cadavers they drop at your feet in the      morning.    </p>    <p>      (For more tips on encouraging mousers, see " Large Pest      Control " by John Vivian in this issue)    </p>    <p>      Alternatively, as mice prefer the dark, leave a bright      light on at night where the mice have been active. In      addition, you can purchase a high-frequency, pest-deterring      siren (pitched above human hearing range) available from      most home and garden stores and catalogs. Get the most      powerful one you can find and put it beside the lamp.    </p>    <p>      Mice will only reproduce at a higher rate if they have an      abundant supply of food. If you are truly overrun with      mice, find and eliminate their food source: sacks of grain      or seeds, accumulated trash or garbage.    </p>    <p>      Next year, keep grass and weeds mowed in a 100'-wide band      all around the house before the plants have a chance to go      to seed and provide the little rodents' primary winter food      supply.    </p>    <p>      Lastly, you can build an owl's nest - a giant birdhouse or      small pet house - about 2 1/2' square with a peaked roof to      shed rain and with a 6"-wide entrance. Fill it with loose      wood shavings and fasten it high in a tree, with the front      facing your driveway or garage. A family of barn owls will      keep the mouse population in check.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dear MOTHER,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We want to grind our own grain to make bread. Which do      you consider the best method, for a grinder.. stone or      steel? And do you have a recommendation for a home      grinder?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Raleigh Hardin</em>    </p>    <p>      Your timing is great. With the Y2K scare, home      food-grinders were hard to get toward the end of 1999. Now,      they are a glut on the market.    </p>    <p>      After more years of a self-sufficient country existence      than we like to admit, there are a few chores that have      proven to be so time-consuming for such a small return that      we are glad to pass them off to machinery and tradespeople.      One such chore is milling flour. (The miller was a popular      tradesman in any pioneer or frontier town. He would grind a      crop for a portion of the grain a farmer brought him so      that no money exchanged hands until the miller sold his      share.)    </p>    <p>      When grinding your own wheat for flour, you have to set the      grinder's burrs so close together that single-pass      handgrinding is very strenuous and time-consuming. We      restrict our milling to nuts, coarse whole-grain flours and      corn by using steel burrs.    </p>    <p>      Fine-textured stone burrs are practically essential to      grind fine-textured bread flours, but they have their      drawbacks. Stone burrs of natural stone or man-made ceramic      composites have grain channels cut into their faces like      old-time, water-powered millstones. In these horizontal      grinders, grains are picked up at the mouth of channels      around the wheel's rim as the wheel turns and are rolled      down the ever-shallower channels toward the hub, where      they're ground down as they pass. But grain can jam in the      channels and the burrs are fine-grained enough that meal      can clog up the grit, so the burrs will slip and quit      grinding if the grain is at all moist or oily. Stone-burred      grinders are no good for nuts, coffee or peanuts (for      peanut butter), and cleaning wears them down quickly.      Replacement burrs are expensive and cost around $50 per      set.    </p>    <p>      Steel burrs consist of opposing steel face-plates with      curved, knife-edged ridges cast into them. Though a bit      crude looking, they work well at producing relatively      coarse grinds of any seed or grain and they can be cleaned      off with a stiff brush. Steel burr replacements cost less      than $10 a set.    </p>    <p>      The crudest and least expensive steel-burr grinders (in the      $30 range) are the cast-iron models from Universal (now      cast in China) and Corona, which are still cast and      tin-plated in Colombia. We use a Corona mill because we've      had one for over 30 years - from back when it was the only      hand-powered grain mill we could get. By now it has become      a member of the family. Thoroughly dry corn can be ground      to a tortilla-fine cornflour meal in two quick trips      through a Corona. A single slow-pass with burrs a little      further apart turns out a coarse cornbread meal.    </p>    <p>      You can find a wide choice in hand and powered grain mills      (and a great deal more) in the big $4.00 catalog from      Lehmans (see " Sources ").    </p>    <p>      <em>Dear</em> <em>MOTHER,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We just bought a 17-acre ranch. The well is a very deep      - 330 feet. l am trying to get off the grid but have not      found an alternative way of pumping water from that      depth.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Dana<br />      Lomeda, TX</em> <em><br /></em>    </p>    <p>      You have quite a number of options, ranging from $50 to      $5,000 in cost. If you live in a windy place, you can erect      a full-size windmill and an in-well push-cylinder pump.      Running on free wind power, these can draw water from a      depth of 600 feet, but they are expensive to install and      intimidating to maintain. The catalog is available from      Kansas Wind Power (see "Sources").    </p>    <p>      A modern 60- to 400-watt wind generator or small solar      array can charge a battery to power a DC push-pump down in      the well and costs less than $500. The solar setups are      available off the shelf from Real Goods and other      alternative energy suppliers.    </p>    <p>      New to the market is a manual deep-well pump, exclusively      from Internet emergency-goods supplier www.watertanks.com ;      tel: (888) 7426275.    </p>    <p>      Also new are small-capacity submersible diaphragm pumps      powered by dedicated solar panels. They can pump a gallon      and a half per minute from 350 feet using just under 200      watts of power. Available from Real Goods.    </p>    <p>      Finally, in a pinch, you can pull up your existing      submersible jet pump, power line and delivery tubing to      clear the 6"- or 8"-wide well casing, and lower a      5"-diameter, cylindrical, galvanized tin drilled-well      bucket on a 400' rope and pull it up hand over hand with a      winch or on a hand-crank reel. It's a lot of hauling, but      the cost is less than $50. Plus, the old-time      hand-stencilled tinware looks cool on the barn wall when      not in use. Available, along with a full line of farm      water-supply equipment, from the homesteaders catalogs (see      " Sources ").    </p>    <p>      <em>Dear</em> <em>MOTHER,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Do you know</em> <em>of</em> <em>any company making      electrical garden tractors?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Will<br />      Coarsegold, CA</em> <em><br /></em>    </p>    <p>      We don't know of a commercially viable electric tractor      being made by an established firm today. The cost of      high-capacity motors and batteries is just too high to      compete with gas engine-powered models. The obvious      environmental advantages alone won't convince enough buyers      to pay ten times what a zippy little John Deere lawn or      garden tractor costs.    </p>    <p>      General Electric made the ElecTrac      lawn-tractor/riding-mower in the 1970s, but lost their      shirts on every sale and discontinued the line years ago.      You can find used ElecTracs for sale at well under $1,000.      They were robustly made, and parts are still available. But      they are slow and heavy, underpowered for attachments, too      low-slung to use in the garden row, and lack the run time      to mow a big lawn on a single charge.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sources<br /></strong> <strong>Lehman's      Non-Electric Catalog</strong><br />      P.O.
