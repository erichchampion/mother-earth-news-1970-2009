                    <p>      <strong>Keeping your adult dog healthy and spry</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Jon Geller    </h5>            <p>      I had no choice but to grab the remote control and stop the      attack. Watching movies like Steven King's <em>Cujo</em> is      just one of the twisted ways that overtaxed veterinarians      like myself entertain themselves between buzzes of the      pager. Why bother sleeping if you're going to be jolted      back to work at any minute anyway?    </p>    <p>      I've experienced many memorable farm calls about country      dogs over the years - although none involved a rabid Saint      Bernard - and I have noticed that many problems can be      prevented. This article, as a follow-up to last issue's      article on the care of puppies, is a primer on the      prevention and treatment of recurring health problems of      the adult dog. Once your dog grows to about 1 to 2 years of      age, there is no reason he or she cannot live a healthy,      happy life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PERFORMING CPR</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>3.</strong> Feel for a heartbeat over thechest, or      for a pulse in the femoral artery on the inside of the      upper back leg (practice feeling for the pulse).<br />      <strong>4.</strong> Apply vigorous chest compressions to      the left side of your dog's chest, one per second, while      someone feels for a pulse. Continue until medical help is      available.    </p>    <p>      <strong>1.</strong> If your dog is not breathing, look in      its mouth to make sure nothing is blocking the      airway.<br />      <strong>2.</strong> Place half a plastic pop bottle (see "      Creating a Pet First Aid Kit ") snugly over your dog's nose      and give one breath per second into the bottle.<br />    </p>    <h3>      SICKNESS AND INJURY PREVENTION    </h3>    <p>      <strong><br />      Fence the Yard</strong>    </p>    <p>      Farm dogs that run free get into trouble. They can get run      over, shot at, cut up by neighboring fences or attacked by      other dogs. Smaller pooches such as Yorkies even make      desirable prey for coyotes, raptors and mountain lions.    </p>    <p>      That's why tunnel-proof perimeter fencing or the more      high-tech, underground invisible fence is needed around      your homestead. Invisible fencing works by giving your dog      a small jolt of electrical current via an electronic collar      if he tries to cross a buried wire. All but the , most      stubborn dogs will respect it. Unfortunately, those      bull-headed beasts that are willing to take a shock to go      after a rabbit find themselves outside the perimeter,      having to take another shock to get back inside. These guys      need the real thing.    </p>        <h3>      Deworm Aggressively    </h3>    <p>      Adult dogs are susceptible to internal parasites,      especially on the farm. A smorgasbord of worms abound in      the average pasture, and your canine will feast on these at      every opportunity. Manure, afterbirths and dead animal      carcasses seem like highly desirable delicacies to even the      most discriminating dogs.    </p>    <p>      A regular deworming for roundworms, hookworms and tapeworms      should be given to any manure- or carcass-loving pooch      every three to six months. Use effective combination      products such as Drontal(restricted) (by prescription only), and      remember that most roundworm/hookworm medications such as      Panacur(restricted) and Strongid(restricted) will not treat tapeworms.    </p>    <h3>      Prevent Ticks and Fleas    </h3>    <p>      As with puppies, it's much easier to prevent flea and tick      infestations than it is to treat them. Ticks carry      infectious diseases such as Rocky Mountain tick fever, Lyme      disease and ehrlichiosis, all of which can be ransmitted to      people. Fleas will enthusiastically feast on your dog's      blood, causing an allergic reaction - or hypersensitivity -      to their saliva.    </p>    <p>      Flea bite allergies cause an intense itchiness that will      drive your pet crazy (and you, too, if you listen to the      scratching all night). To eliminate fleas and ticks, have      your veterinarian prescribe powerful skin ointments such as      the easy-to-ap ply Frontline(restricted) or Advantage(restricted).    </p>		       <h3>      Year-Round Heartworm Prevention    </h3>    <p>      Imagine a slithering, entwined mass of white,      spaghetti-like worms luxuriating in a Jacuzzi of blood in      your dog's heart. Heartworms are spread by mosquitoes and      initially live in the bloodstream as microscopic parasites.      They embark on a migration to the heart as they mature,      wreaking havoc with the cardiovascular system. You can      easily and completely prevent heartworm disease by giving      your dog a monthly, chewable medication.    </p>    <p>      Any dog living with mosquitoes should be on a heartworm      prevention program year-round, since the program also      provides protection against roundworms and hookworms. A      simple blood test should be performed every 2-3 years to      confirm heartworm-free status, especially in areas with      high numbers of mosquitoes.    </p>    <h3>      Vaccinate Conservatively    </h3>    <p>      Dogs over 8-10 years of age that have been vaccinated      regularly may not require annual vaccinations for      parvovirus/distemper/adenovirus 2/parainfluenza, despite      the manufacturer's label recommendation to do so. In fact,      many veterinarians are vaccinating older dogs only two to      three years, if at all. Rabies vaccinat ions,      however,should be kept current with legal requirements      (most call for shots from once a year to once every three      years).    </p>    <p>      Continued annual vaccination for giardia, Lyme disease and      leptospirosis should be given in areas where the diseases      are prevalent. Be aware that there are potential side      effects to vaccination, especially in older dogs, which      include allergic reactions and disorders of the immune      system. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, for example, is a      life-threatening disease in which the immune system      destroys the body's own red blood cells. Some veterinarians      suspect it is trig gered by vaccinations in older dogs that      have been "sensitized" to a particular vaccine. My      recommendation is to vaccinate adult dogs every three      years, with each vaccine on a rotating schedule (see the      vaccination schedule above).    </p>    <p>      <strong>CREATING A PET</strong> <strong>FIRST AID      KIT</strong> <strong><br /></strong> •Bandage      material, consisting of telfa pads, cast padding, elastic      wrap and white medical tape<br />      •Rectal thermometer<br />      •Antibiotic ointment<br />      •Plastic pop bottle cut in half (for CPR)<br />      •An 18-gauge, 1 1/2" needle (for relieving      bloat)<br />      •Penlight<br />      •Hydrogen peroxide<br />      •Tweezers<br />      •Scissors    </p>        <h3>      Provide Sensible Nutrition    </h3>    <p>      Controversy continues among veterinarians about the best      diet for dogs. In general, the quality of grocery-store      brands is closing the gap with premium brands such as Hills      (restricted) and Eukaneuba(restricted). The main difference between      grocerystore brands and premium brands is that premium      brands are field - tested with dogs and use higher-quality      bulk ingredients. I have seen plenty of dogs, however, that      eat the cheapest discount-store dog food available and live      - disease-free - to a respectable old age.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, even the best diet can be sabotaged with      table scraps and highcalorie dog treats. Supplement your      dog's diet with low-calorie abrasive treats such as      Milkbones° and keep in mind that a dry diet will      generally keep the teeth in better shape. Vitamins are      usually not needed as a supplement when a highquality food      is offered.    </p>    <p>      Be mindful of the kind of table scraps you feed your dog -      especially those high in fat - because they can trigger a      bout of pancreatitis. On a recent farm call, I found an      elderly, obese dog collapsed in the yard and unable to      stand. She was regularly fed leftover pork chop bones, and      blood tests revealed pancreatitis. In this condition, the      pancreas becomes inflamed and actually starts to digest      itself with its powerful enzymes. Despite intravenous      fluids and antibiotics, the dog died within several days.      This is an unfortunately common tale.    </p>    <h3>      Don't Ignore Behavior Problems    </h3>    <p>      Excessive barking, chasing livestock and wildlife, killing      chickens and chasing trucks are not qualities that endear      farm dogs to their owners or neighbors. Moreover, these      behaviors are far more life-threatening than many medical      diseases.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, many behavioral problems are so genetically      ingrained that no amount of behavior modification will      help. Other problems like house-soiling, destructive      behavior (due to separation anxiety) and some kinds of      aggression and excessive barking can be improved with a      combination of behavior modifi cation and some newer      medications. (Yes, Prozac might help your dog.)    </p>    <p>      The single best source of information about tackling      behavior problems in dogs is an easy-to-understand book by      Nicholas Dodman, a veterinary behaviorist, called <em>The      Dog Who Loved Too</em> <em>Much:</em> <em>Tales, Treatments      and the</em> <em>Psychology of</em> Dogs (Bantam Books,      1997).    </p>    <h3>      Dog-proof the Shed, Barn and Garage    </h3>    <p>      Dogs love D-Con(restricted) rodent poison, so leave the      mouse-killing to your cats. If dogs eat it, you may not      notice anything until three of four days later when they      start to bleed uncontrollably.    </p>    <p>      Spilled antifreeze is also sweet-tasting and highly toxic,      so be sure to clean up and secure any overflows, oil spills      or store-bought chemicals to prevent other poisonings.      Interestingly, old sheds are ready sources of skin      parasites like mites, lice, ticks and poisonous spiders,      and some dogs will chew lead paint off older buildings and      sheds.    </p>    <h3>      And the Yard...    </h3>    <p>      Moldy food in composts can cause seizures in dogs, and some      species of mushrooms thrive at certain times of the year      but will make your dog deathly ill. Also, exposed metal      lawn edging, fencing wire and old lumber with nails are      notorious for slicing up footpads, so cover sharp edging      with a plastic cap. In general, keep the yard cleaned up to      avoid chronic infections with roundworms and hookworms      (remember, livestock manure is teeming with parasites).    </p>    <h3>      And the House...    </h3>    <p>      Some dogs will eat anything they find. Human medications      dropped on the floor, chocolate cakes, pennies, baby toys      and Christmas ornaments can cause intestinal obstruction,      zinc toxicity or ibuprofen toxicity, to name a few.    </p>    <p>      If your pooch is the type with an oral obsession, keep      things picked up. If your dog starts acting sick about the      same time that something turns up missing, you may have a      problem.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHEN TO CALL THE VET</strong>    </p>    <p>      depending on the size of the dog. Sometimes you can feel      the heartbeat by feeling directly over the lower left side      of the chest.<br />      <strong>3.</strong> Count the breathing per minute, which      should be from 25 to 60 breaths per minute (if your dog is      panting, disregard).<br />      <strong>4.</strong> Check the gums. They should be pink and      moist. If they are pale, gray or sticky, there could be a      serious problem.<br />      <strong>5.</strong> Check skin turgor by pulling up the      hair coat on the back of the neck. The skin should snap      briskly back into place. If it doesn't, that could be a      sign of dehydration.<br />      <strong>6.</strong> Shine a light into your dog's eyes.      Both pupils should initially constrict, then dilate when      the light is diverted. A lack of pupil responsiveness is a      grave sign.    </p>    <p>      Use common sense. If your dog is throwing up, has diarrhea      or is coughing, but is bouncing off the walls and wagging      his tail normally, he will probably get better on his own.      If he seems down and out, lethargic and is not eating,      you'd better get on the phone. Get your dog's vital signs      for more objective information:<br />      <strong>1.</strong> Take the temperature rectally (using a      dedicated thermometer!. Normal body temperature is from      99°F to 102°F<br />      <strong>2.</strong> Get the heart rate by feeling the pulse      in the femoral artery, which runs down the inside of the      back leg. Normal heart rates for dogs run from 80 to 150      beats per minute,    </p>    <h3>      When Your Dog Gets Old    </h3>    <p>      The Jack Russell Terrier struggled to get on his master's      bed, but unforgiving arthri tis of the hips had made it      impossible. He gamely tried repeatedly, until he was given      the needed lift. His gray whiskers bristled as he settled      onto the bed to loyally wait for his master, who was never      to see him again. I had to look away from the movie screen      - this was more sadness than I could handle in one day.    </p>    <p>      Although not all dogs will live as interesting a life as      the terrier in the movie <em>My Dog Skip,</em> most will      deal with many of the same geriatric problems. Arthritis is      a given in most dogs, and can be severe in some large      breeds. "Nutraceuticals" such as glucosamine and      chondroitin sulfate are safe and effective treatments for      milder cases, but powerful prescription products such as      Rimadyl(restricted) are true wonder drugs. Although pricey, these      drugs can make an old dog young again.    </p>    <p>      Some dogs may have bouts of disorientation, incontinence      and confusion. Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome is the      medical term given to the canine version of Alzheimer's,      and a new drug on the market called Anipryl(restricted) may help.      Made by Pfizer, Anipryl has worked (to some extent) in      about 75% of dogs with this problem. Most dogs can live      with this condition as long as their owners are willing to      tolerate an occasional mess and some disorientation. But      when a dog doesn't recognize or respond to its master,      there is no human-animal bond to sustain the relationship.      Which brings us to the last but certainly not least issue      when caring for an adult dog: There will come a time when      we have to say goodbye.    </p>    <p>      While certainly a tough decision by any standard, most      owners seem to know the appropriate time to make it. When      the quality of life has deteriorated to the point where      there is very little left, it is time for euthanasia. Have      your veterinarian come to the house so your loyal buddy can      "go to the other side" while lying in his favorite spot,      surrounded by family members. The intravenous solution will      offer a painless and instant death. Stroke and talk to your      dog while the solution is administered.    </p>    <p>      My pager buzzed again heartlessly. This time I had stopped      by the head office to answer another call of nature, and as      I pulled the pager off my belt to better see the message,      the nagging little device - to my horror - slipped out of      my hand and splashed resoundingly into the toilet bowl.      Eerily, I could read the magnified message "Dog Sick" with      the corresponding phone number as the pager settled to the      bottom of the bowl.    </p>    <p>      Frozen with indecision, I started to reach into the bowl to      retrieve the pager and then thought better of it. What      would happen, I evilly wondered, if I just slowly pushed      down the flush lever on the back of the toilet? I became      hypnotized as I watched the slowly spinning vortex of water      suck my messages into its whirling center.    </p>    <p>      Read more about animal care on      <strong>www.motherearthnews.com</strong> and sample our      best archived articles, bulletin boards and much more!    </p>    <p>      Related info:<br />      First Aid on the Farm    </p>
