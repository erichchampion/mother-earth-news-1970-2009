                    <p>      Here's something that I always have in my pocket and that      has come to my rescue many times. Have you ever been out      camping or hiking and gotten the sticky sap of a pine or      spruce on your hands? As we all know, soap and water won't      get it off - but that little tube of Chap Stick(restricted) in      your pocket will take it off completely. It's also great      for getting off that nasty adhesive left from price      stickers. I recently bought a pair of reading glasses that      had the price sticker stuck onto the right lens. My Chap      Stick(restricted) got the sticker gunk off in a flash without      harming the lens. For years I have wanted to share this      secret but didn't know how to get the word out. Thanks,      MOTHER!    </p>    <p>      <em>Andy Wazelle<br /></em> <em>Machias, ME</em>    </p>
