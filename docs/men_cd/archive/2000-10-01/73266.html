                        <p>      Although foam core paneling has been around for years, the      Department of Energy (DOE) recently teamed up with Champion      Enterprises to construct the first manufactured home built      entirely from such energy-saving materials. The building      material is manufactured by sandwiching recycled      polystyrene foam between two layers of oriented strand      board (OSB), applying heat and pressure, then cutting them      to any size needed. The panels are highly insulated and      energy-efficient.    </p>    <p>      "The reason why it works better than two by fours or stick      framing is because there are very few seams and gaps in the      walls compared to stick framing," explains Michael Lamb,      certified energy manager at the Energy Efficiency and      Renewable Energy Clearinghouse, a division of the DOE.    </p>        <p>      In stick-frame houses, Lamb explains, air can blow into the      wall cavities, whereas with Structural Insulated Panels      (SIPs) - another name for foam core panels - there are      fewer seams and leaks, and the insulation quality of the      wall is very uniform. Lamb also points out that while SIP      construction is slightly more costly to produce than      traditional construction - prices range from $2.50 to $4      per square foot - homebuilders can balance out building      costs by saving on labor and energy bills.    </p>    <p>      The advantages to foam panels are attracting builders such      as Hart Housing and FischerSIPs, Inc., which sell SIP      houses.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Cindy Klinger<br /></em>    </p>
