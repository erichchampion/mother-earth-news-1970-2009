            		<p>		<strong>GARDEN &      YARD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Turn the tables on those annoying backyard pests.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Gail Damerow    </h5>    <p>      <strong>After years of battling snails in my garden while      cooking up escargots purchased at a premium from a local      import shop, I finally got wise. As long as I was gathering      garden snails, why not harvest them for dinner? One bite      told me I was onto something: those fresh snails from my      garden, though smaller, tasted far superior to the pricey      escargots from cans.</strong>    </p>                <p>      This revelation came to me back in the days when most folks      didn't want to know that snails and escargots are one and      the same. When I served garden snails to my friends, their      invariable reaction was "yuk!" But when those same friends      thought they were eating escargots from France, I got rave      reviews. Since then, our American appetite for continental      cuisine has created an ever-growing market for escargots.      At the same time, ecological awareness encourages creative      approaches to ridding our yards and gardens of plant      predators. What could be more creative than turning the      tables on garden pests while, quite literally, putting meat      on the table at virtually no expense? Those creatures once      considered a garden plague are now being avidly sought for      their slightly chewy texture and subtle, earthy flavor.    </p>    <p>      Helix And Cepaea    </p>		<p>		The common garden snail, <em>Helix aspersa, is</em> a    close relative of France's commercially harvested <em>Helix    pomatia.</em> Both can be found on French dinner plates,    where the former goes by the affectionate "petit gris"    (little gray) to distinguish it from its cousin <em>gros    blanc</em> (large white). No one can say for certain how the    French mollusk managed to cross the ocean into North America.    Some folks claim that a mid-1800s French immigrant, craving    this epicurean delight, imported snails and turned them loose    to proliferate in a central California orchard. Others    believe <em>Helix</em> came as a stowaway in grapevine    cuttings brought by the Spanish missionaries who established    the now famous California vineyards.		</p>    		    <p>      Whatever the case, <em>Helix</em> now ravages orchards and      gardens throughout Western and Southern coastal areas.      While it is the best known of the edible snails, plenty of      others are suitable for harvesting. Second in gourmet      popularity is <em>Cepaea,</em> which ranges from the      maritime provides of Canada to as far south as Tennessee.      Known as the grove or garden snail, <em>Cepaea</em> can be      identified by its prettily banded shell. Although few      snails rival the flavors of <em>Helix</em> and      <em>Cepaea,</em> any land snail large enough and abundant      enough to gather is a potential candidate for the table.      </p>			<p>			<strong>Lure Them With Bran</strong>			</p>			<p> French cooks      believe snails gathered in the fall are tastiest, but      gardeners who collect them in spring (when snail damage is      greatest) find little difference in flavor. Because snails      are basically nocturnal, the most productive harvesting      times are nightfall and early morning, when the yard is      still damp with dew. Snails will also crawl out of their      hiding places after a light rain or after the garden has      been watered.</p><p> To harvest many snails at once, lure them to      a gathering spot by taking advantage of their passion for      bran. Leave a handful under an overturned, propped-up      flower pot and the critters will come flocking. After      they've gorged on bran, they'll attach themselves to the      inside of the pot and you can peel them off by the handful.      If snails are munching on your fruit trees, band the trees      with strips of copper. The snails won't crawl over the      bands, but will congregate at the base of each tree for      easy picking.</p><p> Check with your local wildlife or extension      agent first, because some tree snails are endangered and      the law prohibits collection of threatened species. If your      appetite for snails exceeds the supply in your garden, you      should have no trouble convincing neighbors to let you      round up theirs. Avoid areas where potentially toxic      substances have been sprayed. Don't worry about snail bait,      though. Once a snail consumes bait, it won't survive long      enough to be harvested.    </p>    <p>      Heliculture And Snail Housing    </p>    <p>      Once you've harvested your snails, you will need a place to      house them until they're ready to be cooked up. The inner      portion of a bait pail makes a dandy snail farm, and so      does a plastic five-gallon, food-grade bucket with numerous      small holes drilled into it for ventilation. Because a      snail can lift five times its own weight, you'll need a      tight-fitting lid to keep the little Samsons from      organizing an escape. Although one bucket can house up to      500 snails, housekeeping is easier if you gather only as      many as you need for one meal-allowing six per      serving (double if the snails are small).</p><p> Throw in a few      extra to compensate for normal losses. Between batches,      clean the bucket thoroughly. To avoid premature cooking,      keep your snails out of the sun. Suitable sites include      cool basements, airy garages, or any place where the      temperature falls between 55°F and 75°F. Because      you have no idea what your snails have been munching on      that could taste unpleasant to you (or be toxic),</p><p> allow a      10-day cleansing period before your own feast. The French      disdain escargots fed with anything but grape leaves, but      snails do fine on plain lettuce. Some folks pre-season them      by feeding them herbs. Others plump up snails with cornmeal      or bran and high-protein soymeal.</p><p> Like any livestock,      snails need water. A saucer full is sufficient, if you fill      it frequently. Better yet is a narrow-mouth mayonnaise or      canning jar fitted with a vacuum-controlled base, of the      sort used to water baby chicks. The plastic base costs      about a dollar and can be found at most feed stores. For      pre-marinated mollusks, take a tip from the Romans and fill      the jar with wine instead of water.			</p>			<p>			<strong>Believe it or      not, insects are</strong>			</p>			<p>			<strong>finding their way onto      the finest</strong> <strong>American tables.</strong>      <strong>Preparation And De-sliming<br /></strong> Three      days before feast day, withhold food but not water (or      wine) to let the snails finish digesting their last meal.      At the end of this fasting period, rinse snails thoroughly      in cool water and discard any that don't <em>peek out</em>      of their shells. To deslime: Cover the snails with water      combined with two tablespoons of salt and one tablespoon of      vinegar per dozen snails. Soak the snails until they      release all their slime, which takes about four hours. To      speed things up, change the solution several times. Rinse      the snails well, cover them with water (some cooks add a      splash of lemon juice here),</p><p> bring the water to a boil, and      simmer 10 minutes. Cool the snails and remove the meat from      the shells. Garden snails often have thin shells that      shatter easily, making it difficult to follow the      traditional practice of returning them to their own shells      for baking. You can strengthen the shells during the 10-day      feeding period by supplying a calcium supplement, such as      crushed oyster shell of the sort fed to laying hens for the      same reason. Alternatively, discard the shells in favor of      reusable <em>gros blanc</em> shells,</p><p> sold by import shops      as <em>coquilles.</em> Because coquilles are often larger      than the shells your snails came in, stuff each one with      two snails. (To save the coquilles for reuse, wash them in      soapy water. Cover them with fresh water to which a pinch      of baking soda has been added, bring the water to a boil,      rinse the shells, and drain them dry before storing.) To      remove fragile shells from your garden snails, crush the      shells between your fingers and peel away the shards.      Extract the contents of sturdier shells with a nut pick or      seafood fork. As you remove each snail from its shell, peel      the skin from the meat and cut away the black portion at      the end of the tail.</p><p> (If you have plenty of extras, freeze      them for later use, although they'll suffer a slight loss      in texture.) When you're ready for final preparation, cover      the meat with water flavored with your favorite <em>bouquet      garnis,</em> or add a bay leaf and a little parsley, thyme,      onion, garlic, and a few peppercorns. Slosh in some cognac      or substitute white wine for half of the water. Bring the      water just to a boil and simmer the snails for three to      four hours, depending on their size. While the meat cools      in the broth, prepare herb butter. Allow one cube of butter      (no margarine here, please) for each two dozen snails. With      each cube, cream two tablespoons chopped parsley, one table      spoon chopped chives, two crushed cloves of garlic,      one-quarter teaspoon salt, and freshly ground pepper to      taste.    </p>    <p>      The Great Payoff    </p>    <p>      Some cooks find it convenient to both bake snails and serve      them in the same grooved platters, but it's far more      elegant to heat them in a baking pan and transfer them to      clean, preheated platters. When you use a baking pan, pack      the snails closely so they won't roll around, or line the      pan with crumpled foil shaped into a series of depressions      to hold each shell in place. Pour a spoonful of broth or      press a bit of herb butter into each shell, stuff in one      snail (two if they're small), and pack the opening with      herb butter. Then the snails may be wrapped tightly and      stored in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.      Preparing them ahead of time will give them a chance to      absorb extra herb flavor.</p><p> When you're ready to serve them,      pop the baking pan into a 425°F oven for 10 minutes or      until the butter begins to bubble. Escargots are      traditionally served with specially shaped tongs to grasp      shells and narrow, close-tined forks. Fondue forks work      fine, too. Don't use the fork to put the snail into your      mouth-that's uncouth. Instead, place the snail on a      bit of French bread, pour broth and butter from the shell      onto the bread, and pop it into your mouth. If you don't      care for all this protocol, don't give up yet. Snails are      closely related to clams and oysters, and may be prepared      in many of the same ways.</p><p> You might, for example, remove      the cooled snails from their broth, pat them dry, and      sauté them in butter flavored with shallots, garlic,      and a dash of nutmeg. Or dip them in batter and deep fry.      For appetizers, fill sauteed mushroom caps with one or two      boiled snails, top with herb butter, and broil. Snails are      traditionally served as an appetizer or first course, but      they also make a terrific summery entrée served with      a fresh-picked garden salad tossed with oil and vinegar.      Add a loaf of crusty French bread and a bottle of white or      young red wine, and bon appetit!    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Word on Insect Cuisine</strong>    </p>    <p>      Believe it or not, insects are finding their way onto the      best American tables. To satisfy a growing demand for      information, in 1988 the University of Wisconsin began      publishing <em>The Food Insects Newsletter.</em> According      to entomologist and editor Gene DeFoliart,</p><p> cultural bias is      the only thing stopping more Americans from enjoying insect      cuisine. He <em>sees</em> the outlook changing, though, due      in part to a need to <em>meet the</em> world's burgeoning      food requirements and in part to an increasing concern      about the environment and the overuse of pesticides.      Collecting insects as food for humans is the ultimate form      of biological pest control, says DeFoliart, and an      enterprise that's made to order for low-input, smallfarm      production.    </p>    <p>      Among his <em>newsletter's</em> many subscribers are      organic gardeners seeking information on dealing with the      likes of grasshoppers, ants, and grubs. "You have created      an efficient grasshopper predator," wrote one enthusiastic      subscriber after consuming her first meal of grasshoppers,      which she described as being creamy and mildly sweet. (If      you're thinking of trying grasshoppers yourself, DeFoliart      suggests you avoid bright-colored ones.)    </p>    <p>      To date, the only guide (I know of) for preparing the      creepy, crawly things found in your yard is      <em>Entertaining with Insects,</em> the cookbook used by      the chefs who prepared last summer's much acclaimed New      York Bug Banquet at the tony Explorer's Club. The      collection includes such delights as <em>Beetle</em> Bars,      Honey Bee Soufflé, Insect Quiche, and      Cricket-on-the-Hearth Bread.    </p>    <p>      Here, from the book, is Patricia H. Howell's winning entry      in a California Earthworm Recipe Contest:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Earthworm Patties<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      1 1/2 lbs. ground earthworms (Place live worms in flour for      24 hours to purify, boil for 10 minutes, then grind.)<br />      1/2 cup butter, melted<br />      1 teaspoon lemon rind, grated<br />      11/2 teaspoons salt<br />      1/2 teaspoon white pepper<br />      2 tablespoons soda water<br />      1 egg, beaten 1 cup dry bread crumbs<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      1 cup sour cream    </p>    <p>      Combine earthworms, melted butter, lemon rind, salt, and      pepper. Stir in soda water. Shape into patties and dip in      beaten egg, then in bread crumbs. Place in heated butter      and cook for 10 minutes, turning once. Place patties on hot      serving dish. Serve with heated sour cream on top.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note.
