                <p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>       <p>      <strong>If your "stainless"steel pots are stained, try      rubbing them with a little salt.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Rainy Day Film</strong>    </p>        <p>      After several days or weeks without rain, the windshield on      my car gets a greasy film on it. Then, when it finally does      rain and I turn on my wipers, they smear the film, making      it even harder to see.    </p>    <p>      In order to fix this, I fill a small plastic spray-bottle      with floor-wax remover. Just a couple of squirts before I      turn on the wipers gives me clear vision. This trick is      especially useful at night, when oncoming headlights make      vision even worse.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Bud Deunk Fairview<br />      Park, Ohio</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Taking Trees For A Ride</strong>    </p>        <p>      My husband and I moved to our new home on five acres last      year. We had old nursery stock that needed to be moved and      we wanted to put some of it around the house to landscape.      Instead of calling a professional to do it at a high cost,      we decided to remove the trees ourselves. First we dug      around them to loosen the roots. Then we hooked a rope to      our 1970 Ford truck and attached the other side of the rope      to a wooden-slat platform to be used as a sled. Then we      hauled the trees to the selected new spots and replanted      them. We got lots of laughs the first time we used this      technique, but I'll tell you this: it didn't cost us a      thing, except for a little time and patience.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Mrs. Dale Fowler<br /></em> <em>Glen St. Mary,      Florida</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southern Chicken Diet</strong>    </p>        <p>      This morning, my wife excitedly collected 40 eggs from our      50 hens. It all started a month ago, while out buying whole      corn and Eggette mash for my chickens. I got into a      conversation with a farmer who told me that he used to      raise fighting cocks. He said that a chicken farmer from      down South gave him this method of increasing his egg      supply: Each day feed them a little dog food-approximately      25% of their diet. When I told the clerk what I wanted, she      pointed out a 25-pound bag of dog food and said it was what      other farmers fed their chickens. The first time I gave my      chickens a small bucket of the food (a gallon or so), the      egg production jumped from about 24 to 40. From that time      on the count has stayed in the mid 30s. Yesterday I gave      them another half bucket ...and today 40. Because this is      something new to me, and generally unknown to most, I felt      I had to share it.    </p>    <p>      <em>-J.
