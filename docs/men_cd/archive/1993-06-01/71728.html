             			<p><strong>LAST LAUGH </strong></p>      <h5 id="byline">        by Jeff Taylor      </h5>        <p>      The relationship of gardeners and slugs can be summed up in      two words: mortal enemies. "These guys are eating      everything," my wife mutters, looking around at the      tattered foliage. She spies one and squishes it in a gloved      fist. "Gotcha, you little creep. Say your prayers." It's a      safe bet to say this particular slug is about to have a bad      day. Joy has watered and nurtured the garden all through      the summer's heat, so clemency is unlikely.</p><p> She is a      transplanted Vermonter, rather set in her beliefs about      slugs; no use telling her that these gooey bugs are a      natural fixture of Oregon's summer landscape. At one time,      I even spoke in their defense. Sure, slugs are often found      in gardens on half-eaten leaves, I stipulated, but the      evidence against them is purely circumstantial. After all,      slugs don't actually have teeth.    </p>    <p>      "Chlorophyll and cellulose are missing," says Joy, always      the pragmatist. "I don't care how the slugs did it."    </p>    <p>      Live and let live, I used to think. But that was before I      found out that the cellulose was missing from my tomatoes;      nearby, slugs were emitting little belches and trying to      look casual. After that, I took a more Vermontish approach      and made it my business to study <em>Limacidae amicus:</em>      our friend, the slug. Historically, these sticky mollusks      were once useful to humankind. When the first cave persons      invented glue, they turned to the slug for raw material,      mashing them into a paste guaranteed to hold hides against      the body. For a really good grip on a spear, hunters first      squished a slug or two along the shaft.</p><p> And around the      cave, nothing was handier than a slug on a stick for      picking up lint, hair, and other debris. "Hasta la vista,      baby," Joy says, winding up for a tremendous pitch. She      hurls the slug with force and accuracy down to the chicken      coop, where it is welcomed with open beaks. Frankly, this      method is too graphic to describe or imagine. Call it "The      Funky Chicken." My wife hands me a fresh victim. "Here,"      she says, "one for the road." I prefer to lob slugs into      the middle of the highway near our house. Eventually a      logging truck roars by, and the slug hitches a ride, so to      speak. We call this technique "The Black Ice."</p><p>      There are many ways to get rid of slugs. Slug eradication,      in fact, makes shooting fish in a barrel look difficult.      The extreme slowness of slugs allows gardeners time to      designate a victim, go answer the phone, write a few      letters, take a nap, watch some TV, and then go back      outside to smash them with a shovel before they can turn to      flee. But this method ("The Shovel Off") is crude,      unimaginative, and unnecessarily messy. As the poet Robert      Burns wrote, "Wee, slickit, cowering, timorous beastie/I'll      tek ma shoovel and mak you pastie/But och, the gorps are      verra nastie" But there are cleaner methods. I've often      dreamed of taking a pail of them out to the Bonneville Salt      Flats and launching them off golf tees with a      mashie-niblick: "The Sand Trap." </p><p>One can also sprinkle them      with salt ("The High-Sodium Die"), but be advised that      salted slugs make a real production out of shuffling off      their mortal coil. There are several disturbing reports      that they only fake their demise-lying there stiff      and lifeless as a rake handle until they're someday      reconstituted with rain water, at which time they revive      and stagger off. So I pass along the following hint: if you      ever drop one into a can of kerosene and it survives,</p><p>call      the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> and don't make      it mad, because that's one tough slug. Squeamish gardeners      can avoid actually committing slugicide if they happen to      live in a region with caves or sinkholes. An acquaintance      of mine gardens on a mountain riddled with mine shafts, one      of which is so bottomless that he can hear faint sounds of      people speaking Chinese. He takes slugs from his garden and      simply drops them in. None has ever returned from "The Long      Goodbye" Another gravity-fed slug remover is a swiftly      moving river, preferably white water rapids. </p><p>Put the slug      on a cedar shingle, insert this little canoe in the water,      wish him bon voyage, and your conscience is clear. If he      paddles like heck, he might even survive "The Unlucky      Pierre." Finally, we come to the most elegant and humane      termination of all. Slugs come for miles when one fills up      an oil pan with stale beer and leaves it out overnight in      the garden. The next morning, 40 or 50 of them will be      inside the pan, looking very mellow if somewhat dead. Slugs      have definitely perfected a cure for hangover: "The Last      Happy Hour."    </p>
