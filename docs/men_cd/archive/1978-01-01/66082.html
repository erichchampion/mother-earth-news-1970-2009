    <p>
                 <p>      The "super-simple, extremely-low-cost,      anybody-can-build-one" cordwood house has been around a      long, long time. <em>(Ken Kern, for instance, first      featured the concept years ago in his excellent book, The      Owner-Built Home ... and it was already an old, old idea      then.)</em>    </p>    <p>      But it wasn't until this magazine printed an article by New      Brunswick's Jack Henstridge family ("We Built a $75,000      House <em>...</em> For Only $10,000!", MOTHER NO. 45, pages      9699) that the idea really began to catch on in a big way.      Since then, we've covered the concept again with a      three-part article ("The Return of the Cordwood House",      MOTHER NO. 47, pages 2934), the Henstridge family has      published a construction manual on the subject, Jack has      been asked to demonstrate and explain his building methods      to several state and provincial governments and      developmental groups in the United States and Canada, and      dozens of do-it-yourself stackwood houses are already going      up in a number of countries throughout the world.    </p>    <p>      Neverthelessas easy and as fast and as low-cost as a      cordwood building is to fabricatewe know that there's a      whole buncha good folks "out there" who still find the mere      thought of actually putting up their own house with their      own hands <em>...</em> well, intimidating, to say the      least. Maybe you even fall into that group yourself.    </p>    <p>      Well, OK. There ain't nothin' wrong with that. You just      need to have your courage reinforced a little. And the best      way to do that reinforcing is to turn yourself loose on a      "somewhat similar but even simpler" building project.      Something like the Hobbit Garage constructed a while back      by Nancy and Mike Bubel up in Wellsville, Pennsylvania.    </p>               <p>      <em><strong>If you'd like to know even more about the      Bubels, their down-to-earth recycling way of life, and this      example of their handiwork in particular, you'll want to      get a copy of their new book, Working Wood (Rodale Press,      Inc., $3.95) available from any good bookstore or by mail      from Mother's Bookshelf for $3.95 plus 75  cents shipping      and handling.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>NOW PLEASE NOTE:</strong> The construction      principles used by the Henstridges and other stackwood      builders are not the some as those illustrated in this      article. In a "real" cordwood structure, short sections of      log (and the "extra" pieces of insulation placed between      them) are firmly embedded in a matrix of concrete      <em>...</em> to form a permanent, snug, wind- and      waterproof wall. The Bubels, on the other hand, built the      Hobbit Garage shown here simply by stacking their log ends      up into a rough, threesided "Pile", and then adding a roof.      The walls of their building contain no insulation and no      concrete at all.    </p>    <p>      What this means, obviously, is that Mike and Nancy's Hobbit      Garage is far less weatherproof and will have afar shorter      use <em>ful life</em> than, say, the Henstridge family's      stackwood house. But, as the Bubels explain, there are      plenty of times such a "minimum" structure is all you      really need to accomplish a particular purpose.    </p>    <p>      And, as already pointed out in this introduction, we      <em>(MOTHER's editors)</em> are convinced that Mike and      Nancy's Hobbit Garage has at least one more very important      value: It's so bare-bones simple that absolutely anybody      with enough strength and intelligence to stack chunks of      wood can build it <em>...</em> and, once you have a Hobbit      Garage under your belt, you shouldn't find the construction      of a "real" cordwood house intimidating at all!    </p>    <p>      The nice thing about using what's available to make what      you need is that you often end up with a finished product      that's absolutely unlike any other. A finished product      which has a special vitalitya <em>rightness</em> for you      and your placethat could never have come off an assembly      line.    </p>    <p>      Take our garage, for example. When we bought the      Pennsylvania farm we now live on, its only buildings were a      house and a small shed. We didn't like the idea of leaving      our car sitting out in all kinds of weather ... but we      liked even less the idea of spending $5,000 on a      "conventional" garage (we much preferred using that money      to increase the fertility of our soil).    </p>    <p>      And so we banished dreams of a garage to the hidden depths      of our minds while we pushed ahead with the improvement of      our land. It wasn't until we had almost finished clearing      the brush and trees from the site of our future pond, in      fact, that thoughts of the building bobbed to the surface      again <em>...</em> and then, almost by accident.    </p>    <p>      The last tree to go from our minilake's bed was a      humongous, willow with three massive trunks (each 20-24      inches in diameter). My husband, Mike, and a friend cut the      tree down and sliced its logs into 20-inch-long chunks. We      then rolled the rounds of willow up a log-supported ramp      and onto a wagon so we could haul 'em to the house and      split'em for firewood.    </p>    <p>      As it turned out, though, we never did burn those hunks of      willow. Somewhere between the pond site and the house we      began to think of the 20-inch-long sections of log as      building blocks. And almost before we knew what we were      doing, we were well on our way to using them for the      construction of that garage we wanted. Oh, we stacked our      "firewood" up in a pile all right <em>...</em> but it      turned out to be a three-sided pile (with a roof on top)      that we could drive our car right into!    </p>    <p>      Since willow is not exactly the most rot-resistant of      woods, we started our Hobbit Garage by laying down a base      of long-lasting locust and cedar poles. No, we didn't      actually pour a foundation or anything like that. Instead,      we just laid down (parallel and side by side) enough of the      poles to mark out three sides of our planned garage      <em>...</em> and then we began laying half-rounds of the      biggest chunks of willow along the base of rotresistant      cedar and locust.    </p>    <p>      After the first course of "building blocks" was in place,      we continued up with the walls by fitting chunk after chunk      of the willow together as tightly as possible. Naturally we      used the largest pieces of wood first-on the lowest levels      of the wallwhere it was easiest to set them in place. At      that, some of the sections of log were outlandishly big      <em>...</em> and we'd never have gotten them into place      without straining our backs if we hadn't had a couple of      things going for us.    </p>    <p>      In the first place, willow is a very lightweight wood.      (We'd never have been able to lift the same-sized chunks of      oak, locust, or hickory.) And in the second place, we never      lifted any piece of wood we could roll.    </p>    <p>      We rolled the biggest half-rounds of willowend over endinto      position on the locust and cedar base. Then, using the      first wedge-shaped chunk of the lowest course of willow      half-rounds as a ramp, we rolled a second layer of slightly      smaller willow rounds into place on the first. For      succeeding courses (of still smaller chunks of wood), we      simply built up and extended our (rather bumpy) ramp with      additional rounds and halfrounds of the willow. This      built-out "ramp", of course, was removed after we'd raised      our garage's walls as high as we wanted them.    </p>    <p>      Our method of construction, while somewhat primitive, was      really quite easy <em>... but not</em> too easy. Occasional      rounds of the willow would refuse to fall neatly into place      between the chunks of the previous row (or would exhibit      awkward "bumps" which made them hard to position), and we'd      have to jimmy them to where we wanted them with a crowbar.      Mostly, thoughas long as we wore sturdy work gloves and      coordinated our timing ("1, 2, 3, <em>roll!</em> ") we      found the job quite satisfying.    </p>    <p>      All of the main willow "building blocks" were sawed out 18      to 24 inches long (cut edge to cut edge) and were fitted      together quite firmly without any mortar or nails. After      all the big chunks of wood were in place, we went back and      chinked in the gaps between them with lengths of smaller      limbs and branches.    </p>    <p>      Our garage encloses a useful space measuring eight feet      wide and 15 feet long. Its open side faces away from the      prevailing west wind and its roof is pitched just enough      (one side wall is 6'8" high and the other is 5'11") for      good drainage.    </p>    <p>      We used a variety of smaller (two to eight inches in      diameter) logs and sections of limb to even out the tops of      our garage's walls. Then we laid 11 salvaged 2 X 6 rafters      right across the stacks of willow (from one side wall to      the other). These rafters are held firmly in place by a few      vertical oak furring strips which are spiked to both the      roofing supports and the cut faces of several of the logs      in each side wall.    </p>    <p>      Mike nailed sheets of salvaged, 1/2 inch, exterior-grade      plywood (which he scavenged from a wrecked building) across      the rafters and then nailed some rolled black asphalt      roofing over the plywood. The asphalt roofing and the nails      are the only "boughten" materials in the whole garage.    </p>    <p>      We don't deny that our car's new home has a look "all its      own" and we've never claimed the building will last forever      (15 or 20 years seems a reasonable expectation). Still, our      Hobbit Garage more than meets our immediate needs was      constructed almost entirely from, "waste material" we had      on hand ... cost us hardly any out-of-pocket money at all      ... and was a lot of fun to build, It's weathered four      winters so far and is beginning to look quite permanent.    </p>    <p>      In short, if you have more chunks of firewood lying around      (or available for the cutting) than you have money ... and      you need a garage, sheep hut, range shelter, woodshed,      outhouse, or other outbuilding ... we think you'd be wise      to at least consider the "quick and easy and inexpensive"      method of construction used in our Hobbit Garage. And      remember that you can always make one of these structures      more weathertight in just a few minutes by hanging an old      tarp or rug across its entrance.    </p>    <p>      You can also make the whole building a lot snugger by      stacking firewood around its "permanent" walls. That's what      we've done. And that's why our garage now looks even more      like some strange, lovable structure from Middle Earth ...      hunched, chunky, woody, and slightly lopsided. Sometimes,      in factwhen the mist is swirling around it on a nippy      morningwe can almost see Hobbits and Trolls huddled      together under its funky wooden eaves.    </p>
