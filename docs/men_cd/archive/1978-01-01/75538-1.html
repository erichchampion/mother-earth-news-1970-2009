        One of many variations of Bob Smyers's basic design ... and (in smaller box) one of the ""cutest"" water tank stoves that MOTHER's experimenters have made. Dennis Burkholder also demonstrates that the large, flat, warp-proof filler lid on his heater tank stove can be wed as a near-ideal cooking surface too. This feature, alone, makes the wood-burner a good ""standby"" to have on hand for any family that might experience utility service disruptions.
