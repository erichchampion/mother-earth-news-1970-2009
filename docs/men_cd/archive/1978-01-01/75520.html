                   <p>      <em>In Issue No. 37, Bill Wodrasks shared some of his      thoughts regarding one of mankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied ... and announced our      stillstanding offer Anyone (and that means you!) who sends      us a short (200 words or less) account of an actual barter      that's good enough to print will receive-as the folks      on the following pages have-a twelve-month subscription (or      extension of same) to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).</em>    </p>              <p>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), Inc., P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28739</p>      <p>      When I was growing up in the city, barter was an unknown      term, but now I couldn't get along without it! For      instance, I've traded houseplants for jelly, old clothing      for mending, and surplus corn for fresh salmon. And in the      winter <em>-</em> since we don't own the kind of      heavy vehicle suitable for travel on snowpacked roads      <em>-</em> our neighbor rims errands for us in      exchange for baby-sitting.    </p>    <p>      Last (and best) of all are the barters that occur between      my husband and me . . . like a backrub, for help with      caulking, or a thorough shampoo for doing the dishes. These      husband-wife swaps are fun, and they usually make for a      better day.    </p>    <p>      Lynn Moen<br />      Dunkerton, Iowa    </p>    <p>      My first barter arrangement couldn't have worked out any      better. It was the year after I'd bought my property, and      there were three main factors involved: [1] I was still      desperately broke from the 10-acre purchase, [2] the sugar      maples on the place had been logged many years before,      which left an "overstory" of beech and red maple, and [3] I      needed the old logging road on the property graded and      graveled.    </p>    <p>      Hence, I struck a deal with a local logging contractor who      wanted to harvest the beech and red maple (which I wanted      thinned anyway), and who in return gave my old logging road      the work it needed.    </p>    <p>      At that point, I'd already benefited twice ... but the      story wasn't over yet, because the tree tops that were left      behind made excellent stovewood, with littl e or no      splitting required. Since there were more tops than I had      time to cut and store, I swapped some to a neighbor for his      occasional welding services.    </p>    <p>      So <em>-</em> with a four-way win on my very first      barter <em>-</em> you can be sure I'll continue to      rely on this medium of exchange in the future!    </p>    <p>      Peter Benison<br />      Montgomery Center, Vt.    </p>    <p>      I live and work in Massachusetts, so I'm only able to enjoy      my cabin in New Hampshire on sporadic weekends and      vacations. I'd been contemplating the possibility of a      barter situation <em>-</em> work for housing      <em>-</em> but I didn't want to give up my use of the      property.    </p>    <p>      One day I casually mentioned my situation to a friend, and      his face immediately lit up. He told me he was starting      college soon in a nearby New Hampshire town and needed an      inexpensive place to live. We soon decided it could be      mutually beneficial to make that work-for-housing trade I'd      thought of, for it would allow me to still visit my cabin      on weekends and holidays and feel comfortable about it. (He      goes home to see his friends and family most weekends,      anyhow.)    </p>    <p>      I pay the mortgage, he pays the utilities, and after only      one month I have a new back porch and deck complete with      shingled roof ... plus the security of knowing that      someone's watching over the property in my absence. And my      friend has a rustic cabin to live in, rent free    </p>    <p>      Patti Illsley<br />      Watertown, Mass.    </p>    <p>      Four years ago I bought 25 acres of unimproved land just      outside our Colorado town. I was happy to see the value of      the property increase as time went by, but the cost of      house construction in our area ($30,000 and <em>up</em> )      grow even more quickly.    </p>    <p>      When my wife and I moved onto the land with a 20-year-old      trailer and temporary utilities, we dreamed of building a      "real home", but after five months I hadn't even passed the      planning department, septic system, and building permit      stage. Our dream seemed unreachable.    </p>    <p>      Then a friend introduced us to a building contractor who      was looking for acreage on which to put up a house of his      own ... and we worked out a perfect deal! We gave him five      acres on the western end of our property, and he built us a      beautiful little custom house on our favorite part of the      remaining acreage. We were even able to design, decorate,      and decide details for our dream home throughout its      construction.    </p>    <p>      Both parties ended up very pleased with this swap (and with      Its excellent financial advantages). I've made a lot of      trades in my life but this is my biggest and best of all.    </p>    <p>      L.K. Meens<br />      Grand Junction, Colo.    </p>    <p>      With a new baby to care for <em>-</em> a baby who      hardly ever sleeps in the daytime <em>-</em> I was      unable to put in much of a vegetable garden last year. But      I did find time (mostly at night) to work in my darkroom      and pursue my hobby of photography.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, my neighbor <em>-</em> who      <em>did</em> have time to put in a garden <em>-</em>      was more than happy to trade her fresh, organically grown      vegetables for a few 8" X 10" portraits of her three      children. So for a couple of nights' "work" in my bathroom      darkroom I received about ton pounds each of beets and      onions, handfuls of carrots and green beans, and several      ears of corn, as well as raspberries, grapes, and three      cantaloupes!    </p>    <p>      I,ve also traded an old twin-size mattress for six rabbit      hutches, and <em>-</em> since I own a dehydrator      <em>-</em> I regularly swap dried fruit for the      canned variety with friends down the road. And I trade my      excess bunnies to some other neighbors for fresh eggs.    </p>    <p>      Bartering beats buying, that's for sure!    </p>    <p>      Ann Mongelli<br />      Grants Pass, Ore.    </p>    <p>      As a widow with three youngsters, I have trouble getting my      social security check to last the month. Not until I began      reading I 'Successful Swaps", though, did I even consider      barter as an alternative to hard cash.    </p>    <p>      By early last winter, I'd worked up enough "barter      confidence" to go ahead and make my first deal. The      situation was that my gas dryer needed to be converted to      accept bottled gas ... and when I asked the local dealer      who was to perform the work if he would accept some of my      young pullets in trade for his parts and labor, he agreed.      This was my beginning... and I felt great!    </p>    <p>      Since I "took the plunge", I've also traded a tent for a      good lawn mower, housecleaning for two beautiful winter      coats for my daughters, and 18 pints of my bread-and-butter      pickles for a like amount of green beans and applesauce.    </p>    <p>      Much of my barter would be considered "small-scale" (like      three quarts of tomatoes for five pounds of sugar), but      each swap really helps out ... and it's a lot of fun      besides! So thank you, MOTHER ... even though I can't thank      you enough for "turning me on" to barter!    </p>    <p>      Christine Althaus<br />      Brodhead, Wis.    </p>    <p>      I have to admit that when my husband, David, and I first      moved to the English Valley here in Iowa, we used to get      strange looks from some of the local people. That was      because David didn't <em>-</em> and still doesn't      <em>-</em> hold down a regular 40-hours-a-week job.      But now, after trading with these folks for five years,      we've earned their respect for the lifestyle we've chosen.    </p>    <p>      Our best bartering item is the beautiful hand-carved      furniture we make out of the slab wood David brings home      <em>-</em> free for the hauling <em>-</em> from      his part-time sawmilll job. Last winter, for instance, my      daughter and I exchanged some of the furniture for dancing      lessons.    </p>    <p>      We also got a much-needed harness in trade for making axe      and cant book handles ... and our baby-sitters trade their      services for home-churned butter.    </p>    <p>      One standing swap that I have every year with a neighbor of      ours is all the apples I can put up in exchange for my help      on chicken butchering day.    </p>    <p>      Right now we're working on trading a milk goat for an      accordion!    </p>    <p>      RoJene O'Mara<br />      North English, Iowa    </p>    <p>      We moved to rural Vermont four years ago with little money      ... and have since discovered the benefits of barter as a      means of meeting needs and neighbors.    </p>    <p>      When we couldn't figure out how to repay favors (such as      loans of tools), we baked bread or pies which      <em>-</em> we learned <em>-</em> were always      welcomed and appreciated gifts.    </p>    <p>      Then, not long ago, a man who spends summers nearby      <em>-</em> and didn't have facilities for canning      <em>-</em> brought us his vegetables to "put up" ...      and we got to keep half of the final product for our      efforts. The summer resident then asked if we needed some      furniture, which we accepted in return for weekly      "payments" of bread and cookies.    </p>    <p>      Now that our chickens are laying, we trade eggs for honey      and milk from a local farmer. Another neighbor (in his      seventies) lavishes us with smelt and perch during      lee-fishing season ... so we fix the dinner and he comes to      share it with us. When the same elderly gentleman's garden      produces a surplus, he brings us baskets of tomatoes to      make into sauce, and-again-we divide the bounty.    </p>    <p>      We also trade magazines ... doubting our available reading      material at half the price. And, frequently, time is traded      for time . . . as with the cutting and stacking of wood in      exchange for carpentry labor.    </p>    <p>      Barter, in short, allows us to share surplus food,      eliminate waste, and discover our own resourcefulness.    </p>    <p>      Pat Noll<br />      Vergennes,Vt.    </p>    <p>      I never thought that I possessed any skills or goods that      would be worth bartering, but I recently learned that you      don't need homegrown vegetables or a way with a hammer to      enjoy successful swaps. Spare time and a desire to help      have been the only requirements for my trades.    </p>    <p>      My first experience occurred when my friend and neighbor      <em>-</em> Maria <em>-</em> needed some help      with last-minute housecleaning before the arrival of      unexpected company. I was glad to pitch in but I really      couldn't accept her offer of cash payment. After all, what      are friends for? However, Maria wanted to reward me in some      way, so we came to an agreement that pleased us both. I had      always admired her beautiful handmade jewelry ... so, in      return for my work, she guided me in making a few simple      pieces. I kept two of my creations and sent a choker to my      sister in Ohio. That swap went a long way!    </p>    <p>      In the months that followed, I received some much needed      curtains for a few hours of baby-sitting ... and when I      helped clean out part of Maria's basement to make room for      a pottery studio, we found a lovely wall plaque that is now      hanging in my home (and I'll soon be getting free pottery      lessons!).    </p>    <p>      With bartering, everything seems to work out evenly ...      without "driving a hard bargain"!    </p>    <p>      Linda Allison Klem<br />      Conifer, Colo.    </p>    <p>      Although I've been a city boy most of my life, I've      incorporated barter into my lifestyle as much as possible.      When I was first married, I traded yard work and lawn care      for half my monthly rent ... and through the years I've      continued to keep an eye out for potential swaps, such as      having the electrical service upgraded in my house after I      helped my neighbor lay a new concrete driveway and garage      floor.    </p>    <p>      Last summer, my family realized a longtime ambition with      the purchase of a country home ... and I began to trade in      earnest!    </p>    <p>      A neighbor who knew that electronics was one of my favorite      hobbles asked me to do some repair work on two television      sets in exchange for one bred doe rabbit and a second doe      with a two-week-old Utter of eleven offspring. I was soon      in the "bunny business" deep enough to provide all the      rabbit my family could eat!    </p>    <p>      Then a nearby dairy farmer asked me what I'd charge him for      a couple of bred does. We worked out a swap for his next      born bull calf ... and he threw in some field corn free for      the picking.    </p>    <p>      Just after that, I arranged a trade with a fellow I work      with: half a dozen meat rabbits for one of his feeder pigs      (and then I surprised him with a gift subscription to      MOTHER!). Of course, the sow is now happily eating the free      corn that I gathered from the dairy farmer's fields.    </p>    <p>      Our rabbits have certainly multiplied ... but in the most      extraordinary ways!    </p>    <p>      Gary A. Helmic<br />      Mason, Mich.    </p>    <p>      My husband and I <em>-</em> though still tied to the      city rat race <em>-</em> have a house in the      mountains that we go to for our real living one day, while      driving along a hilly road not far from our "retreat", we      saw a sign that said "Apples", so-since we grow only      grapefruits and oranges down here in Florida      <em>-</em> we pulled right in and quickly got to know      the friendly woman who owned the orchard.    </p>    <p>      After a personal tour of her cold cellar, with its hundreds      of jars of preserved foods, and a taste of her homemade      grape wine, we made an agreement to exchange our citrus      fruit for her apples.    </p>    <p>      Over the years we've brought her bags of oranges,      grapefruits, avocados, and anything else that happens to be      in season down here ... and we've enjoyed not only her      apples but her rhubarb, her good advice, and her      friendship.    </p>    <p>      Whenever we smell one of our apple pies baking, or chomp      down into one of those fresh juicy fruits, we know we've      made a good trade.    </p>    <p>      Lida Iles<br />      Lakeland, Fla.    </p>    <p>      This past spring I moved to a country house that sits right      in the middle of an old vineyard which still produces      bumper crops. Since I know very little about how to harvest      and preserve grapes, I was a bit overwhelmed by the      abundance of fruit that later began to appear on the vines.    </p>    <p>      As soon, however, as a friend of mine let on that she could      make jam, I knew there was going to be a swap. And sure      enough ... now, for every bushel of grapes that she picks      and makes Into jam for me, she gets to keep a bushel for      her own use.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, her husband is a cement contractor who loves      to make homemade wine. So he gladly agreed to help me lay      some cement in the kiln room of my future pottery workshop      ... in exchange for the grapes that he'll transform into      his favorite beverage.    </p>    <p>      Now I can't wait to get my pottery going, because that will      open up many more bartering opportunities for me!    </p>    <p>      Gary Smith<br />      Montrose, Mich.    </p>    <p>      Our eleven-year-old daughter has always wished for a horse      of her own, and two years ago <em>-</em> when we      lived in a town house in upstate New York <em>-</em>      my husband and I decided to make her dreams come true.    </p>    <p>      We all knew, however, that a horse wouldn't be welcomed by      our condominium neighbors, and keeping the animal at a      local stable would've cost us $60 or more every month ...      so we began a search for an inexpensive solution to our      horse-boarding problem.    </p>    <p>      We started off by stuffing notes in the mailboxes of nearby      farmers, asking them if they had any pasture to rent. Our      answer came from a couple who owned an old farm adjacent to      our housing development.    </p>    <p>      These neighbors offered us free use of their five acres if      we would cut weeds, fix fences, and make necessary repairs      in their old barn. The landowners supplied some of the wire      for the fencing and even resurrected an old hand pump so we      could use an ancient well in the barn. We provided the rest      of the materials, the tools, the labor... and the horse.    </p>    <p>      What a low-cost, low-risk way of achieving I "the      impossible dream!"    </p>    <p>      Sharon L. Naismith<br />      Clayton, Calif.    </p>    <p>      I'm an elementary school teacher and I've been trying to      educate my students about recycling and saving our      resources. Since firsthand experience usually works best, I      decided to have a "Recycle Day" in my classroom.    </p>    <p>      All the children understood that <em>-</em> with      their parents' permission <em>-</em> they could bring      any usable items from their homes that might otherwise be      destined for the garbage can. Our plan was to set out all      the "treasures" in the morning for everyone to see ... and      do some serious trading that afternoon.    </p>    <p>      What a success! My students brought in all sorts of things      to trade: books, magazines, records, radios craft objects,      stuffed animals, toys, games, etc. The children quickly      learned the value and tun of trading rather than dumping.    </p>    <p>      We agreed to have another swap event soon ... and      everyone's looking excitedly forward to our next "Recycle      Day".    </p>    <p>      Greg Hanson<br />      Harvey, N.D.    </p>
