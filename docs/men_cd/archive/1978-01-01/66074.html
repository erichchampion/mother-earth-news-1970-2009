    <p>
                       <p>      When Miles K. Free III sent us an article telling how he'd      recycled an old refrigerator into part of a solar water      heating system (see "Recycle a Refrigerator Into a Solar      Water Heater", pages 108-109, MOTHER NO. 48) ... he      didn't know that MOTHER's researchers had already been      working on the same idea for some time.    </p>    <p>      Whereas Miles began his project by thinking about how easy      it'd be to convert a refrigerator into an insulated storage      cabinet for a tank of solar-heated water, however, MOTHER's      research staff sorta approached their conversion project      "the other end to".    </p>          <p>      It all began with an old junked Hotpoint refrigerator that      a couple of MOTHER's people were taking apart with the idea      of using its compressor as a small solar-powered steam      engine or something of that nature. Almost immediately,      though, the experimenters were speculating about the heat      exchange coils on the back of the reefer's cabinet.    </p>    <p>      "Hey, that looks an awful lot like the serpentine tubing      which goes inside a flat-plate solar collector."    </p>    <p>      "Yeah, except that the diameter of this stuff-it      looks like it's about a quarter inch-is so much      smaller than the diameter of the tubing-about a half      inch-generally used in a collector."    </p>    <p>      "Yeah ... but I betcha this exchanger will work in a      flat-plate. It may not work as <em>efficiently</em> as a      heat exchanger custom-made of bigger tubing, but I think      it'll still work. And if it does ... heck, the price is      surely right."    </p>    <p>      So our intrepid adventurers forgot all about their steam      engine project and began looking for an insulated collector      box to mount their prefabbed heat exchanger in. Just then      their eyes fell on the old Hotpoint's front door.    </p>    <p>      "Hot dog. Look at this. All we've got to do is take the      plastic liner out of this door and the exchanger will fit      right in. We've already got two-thirds of our whole      flatplate collector built for us ... and we haven't even      picked up a hammer yet."    </p>    <p>      What the boys were crowing about was the fact that whoever      had originally designed that trusty old Hotpoint ...      couldn't have done a better job of making the fridge easy      to recycle into a flatplate solar collector. On the one      hand, the reefer's heat exchanger-a nearly flat sheet      of steel with a serpentine length of tubing already welded      to it looked (except for the fact that its tubing was      small) just one heck of a lot like the heat exchangers in      some very expensive solar collectors. And on the other, the      fridge's door-which was really a shallow steel box      that was already well insulated-made as nearly an      Ideal flat-plate collector box as if it had actually been      planned for that end use.    </p>	     <p>      So the boys pulled the liner out of the Hotpoint's door and      replaced it with the heat exchanger. Then a couple of holes      were drilled through one end of the door and a couple of      pieces of scrap copper tubing (also scavenged from the      refrigerator) were used to extend the exchanger's coils      through the insulated wall. (It was exceptionally easy to      slip the recycled 3/8-inch tubing right over the ends of      the 1/4-inch plumbing and solder the "splice" into a      watertight junction.)    </p>    <p>      Next, six holes were drilled through both the exchanger      plate and the "back" of the collector box (actually,      through the main body of the old refrigerator door) and the      two were fastened together with stove bolts. Some odd      pieces of cardboard were then used to cover the insulation      that was still exposed around the "rim" of the exchanger      (this was done purely for appearances), and the heat      exchanger and its surrounding paperboard trim were all      painted flat black.    </p>    <p>      Finally, two pieces of glass were cut to fit as a "top" for      the collector box. The panes were mounted just under the      old door's rubber gasket (how's that for having just what      you want just where you want it?) and seated in place on a      bead of silicone caulking.    </p>		    <p>      MOTHER's crew of merry experimenters then hooked their new      collector to a small pump and circulated a strong detergent      solution through the flatplate's plumbing to flush out any      residue Freon. After that, they connected the      collector/pump to a barrel of water, aimed the solar panel      at the sun, and turned the pump on. Sure enough! The      circulating water immediately began picking up Btu's as it      passed through the collector ... and a thermometer soon      showed that those calories of heat were, indeed, being      transferred to and stored in the drum of water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN IMPORTANT POINT:</strong> Please note      that-due to the small cross section and serpentine      pattern of the tubing in the old Hotpoint's heat      exchanger-this flatplate collector was not suitable      for use in a "passive" thermosiphoning water heating      system. (See the interview with David Wright in MOTHER NO.      47 for an explanation of a passive solar heating system's      operation.) However, merely by hooking a small pump to the      flatplate and pumping water through the collector (and a      great many "real-solar panels are set up to work      exactly this way), MOTHER's      scavenged-from-a-refrigerator-in-a-couple-of-hours      collector was made to work just fine.    </p>    <h3>ANOTHER INNOVATION</h3>    <p>      So far, so good. But our researchers hadn't even gotten      started. As long as they already had the makings of an      exceptionally low-cost active solar water heating system on      their hands, they figured they might as well go ahead and      do the job up right. With antifreeze (so sub-zero      temperatures wouldn't bust their solar panel or the      plumbing attached to it) circulating from the recycled      collector to an insulated exchanger tank ... and a separate      set of waterlines (cold in and hot out) leading from that      exchanger tank to somebody's home.    </p>		    <p>      The only real problem with that idea, of course, is that      exchanger tanks are expensive ($170 and up) and hard to      locate. Which is why MOTHER's deucedly clever inventors      didn't even bother trying to find a ready-made exchanger      tank to buy.    </p>    <p>      Instead, they went down to the warehouse/workshop of the      local natural gas utility (United Cities Gas) and asked for      one of the "worn-out" gas-fired water heaters that such      companies frequently sell as scrap. And the folks at UCG      were nice enough to lay such a tank on MOTHER's men for      free.    </p>    <p>      Now one of the nice things about the "worn-out" water      heater tanks which the various gas companies around this      continent discard ... is the fact that a good many of those      tanks aren't really worn out at all. They're merely      defective. The containers leak water all right, but not      necessarily because they've rusted through. And if you      remove the sheet metal "wrapper" and fiberglass insulation      from the basic tank itself ... you'll very often find that      the container is only leaking from one small pinhole on a      single seam which was never welded quite right when the      container was put together in the first place. Such a hole      is very easy to "patch" with just a tiny spot weld.    </p>    <p>      Another very nice thing about these discarded gas-fired      water heater tanks is the exhaust stack that extends right      through each one of the drums, from its bottom all the way      up to its top. This stack was originally designed to      transfer heat from a gas flame (burning inside the stack)      to the water in the surrounding tank. It's very obvious,      then, that if you plumb one of these heater tanks up and      run solar-heated hot antifreeze through its stack ...      you'll stand a very good chance of transferring large      quantities of heat from the central pipeful of circulating      antifreeze to the water surrounding it.    </p>    <p>      Which is just what our boys had in mind. And which is just      what they did. The conversion was made by welding one      two-inch pipe coupling into the top of the water heater      tank's exhaust stack and another into the stack's bottom. A      two-inch- to- three- quarter- inch reducing bushing was      then screwed into each of the couplings and standard 3/4"      copper tubing and fittings attached to the bushings.      Presto! A $170 exchanger tank was ours for slightly over      $5.00 In hardware and a couple of hours of our time.    </p>    <p>      At this point we could have put the original meager      insulation and sheet metal wrapper back on the exchanger      tank ... but we wanted something much better. So we built a      plywood box big enough to give the tank a good six inches      of clearance all around when set down inside the wooden box      ... and completely filled the space surrounding the drum      with MOTHER's good ole homemade cellulose insulation (see      "How to Make and Install Your Own Insulation", pages      120-121, MOTHER NO. 48).    </p>    <p>      The super-insulated exchanger tank was then carted over to      the home of Butch and Larry Goodwin (two of MOTHER's      helpers) and plumbed up with copper tubing to the Hotpoint      refrigerator door collector, a second collector built from      a Coldspot refrigerator door and heat exchanger, a Grundfos      pump, a Hawthorne controller, and the waterlines for the      Goodwin's house.    </p>    <p>      And what happens now is the controller constantly monitors      the tempera. ture of the antifreeze in the collectors and      the water in the exchanger tank. And whenever the first is      at least 3°F warmer than the second, it turns on the      pump and circulates the hotter antifreeze from the      collectors through the exchanger tank's central stack      (where the hot fluid gives up some of its heat to the      surrounding water) and back again. The controller also runs      the pump at a slower speed when the collectors are only      slightly warmer than the storage tank ... but at high speed      when the sun is really blazing and there's a great deal of      trapped heat in the collectors to transfer to the exchanger      drum.    </p>    <p>      An ordinary paint can with a plumbing connector soldered to      its bottom serves as both an expansion tank and a filter      spout on the "closed loop" of circulating antifreeze. The      system is filled with a 50/50 solution of water and      propylene glycol ... and propylene glycol (which is used to      winterize the plumbing fixtures in motor homes and camping      trailers) was chosen because it's non-toxic and will not      contaminate the Goodwin's household water supply if the      stack inside the system's exchanger tank ever develops a      leak.    </p>    <p>      The total cost of this solar water heating system (which      now heats most of the water used by a family of four) was      $173.04 ... and we'll put the rig up against manufactured      units costing anywhere from $500 to $1,500.    </p>    <h3>ANOTHER DESIGN</h3>    <p>      Nobody could have called us quitters if we'd stopped this      particular set of experiments right there. But once we'd      gotten that far with an active solar water heater scrounged      up largely from recycled refrigerators and other salvaged      parts ... well, we'd begun asking ourselves why we couldn't      cobble together a passive system from mostly the same kind      of materials.    </p>    <p>      So MOTHER's Little Elves selected a relatively tall General      Electric fridge from her large stock of old freezers and      refrigerators (see sidebar) and removed its compressor,      heat exchanger coils, motor, and other hardware. Then they      stripped out all the unit's shelves and racks ... even its      lining and insulation (the insulation was carefully set      aside for later use). The lining-but not the      insulation-was also taken out of the reefer's door.    </p>    <p>      The resulting empty case was then turned on its side and a      salvaged, stripped-down, 40-gallon, electric water heater      tank was mounted inside the box on wooden supports. (In      addition to being stripped, the tank was further modified      by the addition of a fitting welded into its original base      and the plugging of an "extra" opening on its other end.)    </p>    <p>      Next an "absorber plate"-much like the scavenged heat      exchanger panels used in the refrigerator door flat-plate      collectors already described in this article ... except      with parallel runs of 1/2-inch copper tubing instead of a      serpentine run of 1/4-inch tubing for the circulating fluid      to flow through-was put together.    </p>    <p>      The absorber consists of six parallel lengths of 1/2-inch      hard copper pipe spaced 3-3/4" apart and connected across      their ends with standard plumbing T's and elbows (see      illustration). This manifold was then soldered onto the      flattened and trimmed (so it would just fit inside the      refrigerator door in place of the removed lining) sheet of      steel that had once been wrapped around the insulation on      the salvaged water heater tank. Note, 'too, that the      manifold was mounted on the sheet of metal with one end      slightly higher than the other. This was done on purpose so      that any bubbles which might ever form in the tubes      willinstead of forming an "air lock"-automatically      rise up and flow out of the manifold into the water storage      tank above.    </p>    <p>      The absorber plate-manifold and all-was then      painted flat black and mounted inside the insulated      refrigerator door. The manifold was connected to the      storage tank with two flexible hoses and a double strip of      Masonite was added to the door to [1] hold the hoses in      place and [2] form one edge of the mounting for the glazing      that was installed next. Just as in the refrigerator door      flat-plates already described, this glazing consisted of      two pieces of glass cut to fit, mounted under the door's      rubber gasket on three sides (and on the double strip of      Masonite on the other) and scaled in place with silicone      caulking.    </p>    <p>      The whole unit was next mounted on the sunny south wall of      <strong>MOTHER's</strong> research shop and its storage      tank was plumbed up with two connections: a cold "in" line      from the city water main and a hot "out" line running into      the workshop. After all the connections were checked for      leaks, mucho insulation (both the fiberglass batting that      had originally been removed from the case and as much      "extra" homemade cellulose as could be packed in) was      stuffed around the storage tank, and the refrigerator case      was closed off with a panel of waterproof Masonite.    </p>    <p>      You'll notice that this sheet of Masonite has aluminum foil      glued to its front (to reflect a little more solar fall      down onto the collector panel). If you look closely at the      opened solar water heating system, you'll also see that the      two hoses running from the collector panel to the insulated      storage tank pass through elongated slots in the sheet of      Masonite fastened over that tank. These slots allow the      hoses to " fold up" inside the insulated cavity, thereby      making it possible for the flat-plate collector door to be      swung up and closed at night and on overcast days. This [1]      protects the unit from freezing up during subzero weather,      [2] protects the critical parts of the system from vandals      at night, and [3] makes it possible to heat a tank of water      with solar radiation on a bright, sunny day ... and then      save and use that hot water as desired throughout as much      as a following week of overcast, cold weather.    </p>    <p>      Pretty clever, these experimenters of ours! And this whole      passive solar water heating and storage system -which      supplies 100% of a threeto four-man shop's hot water      needs-only cost us $41.97 out-of-pocket. Show us a      commercially manufactured unit with anywhere near the same      performance for anything less than $1,000 ... and we'll      give you a free blistering-hot hand wash on any winter's      day of your choice.    </p>    <h3>A SMALL DISCOVERY</h3>    <p>      While working on this recycled refrigerator project,      MOTHER's researchers stumbled onto an idea that could well      be developed into a profitable home business by hundreds of      readers scattered across the country.    </p>    <p>      What happened was-in an effort to assemble a large      collection of old refrigerators, freezers, and water tanks      to experiment with-we ran a small classified ad in      the local very small daily newspaper. The ad read: "Will      haul away discarded refrigerators and hot water tanks" . .      . and the response was overwhelming.    </p>    <p>      Within two days ( <em>well</em> within two da s) we were      qualifying our telephone calls (is ("What kind of      refrigerator'? What shape is it in?"). In short, if our      experiences are any indication, a <em>lot</em> of people at      any given time in any given community across the United      States and Canada are anxious to have someone haul away old      refrigerators, freezers, and water heaters.    </p>    <p>      We found that quite interesting. But the really      <em>amazing</em> part of the whole deal was the fact that      <em>six out of the first eleven refrigerators we</em>      <em>picked up were still in working order . . . or began      running as soon as we replaced the appliance's temperature      control switch</em> . Or, to put it another way: With just      a little tinkering, over half of all the fridges we picked      up could have been sold at a handsome profit as "good used      refrigerators in operating condition".    </p>    <p>      Aha! Suddenly it became apparent to us why so many small      towns across the country always seem able to support at      least one "used furniture dealer" who specializes in old      kitchen ranges and refrigerators ... and who always seems      to do as well or better than the "real" merchants downtown.      This guy may <em>look</em> as if he's dealin in junk ...      but he's really handling solid gold!    </p>    <p>      Very quickly, then: [1] A very small and very inexpensive      classified ad can very quickly put more used refrigerators,      freezers water heaters, etc., at your fingertips than      you'll know what to do with. [2] A number of people will      even offer to pay you to haul the units away. [3] Over half      of those appliances-if our experience is any      indication-still work beautifully or can be put back      in running order with hardly any output of labor or cash.      [4] There's always a market for good used major appliances.      [5] The real clunkers will still cover your overhead when      carted to a junk dealer and sold as scrap. [6] Or, better      yet, convert those clunkers into solar water heaters and      sell 'em that way! Any way you look at it, there's a good      solid net $10,000- or $15,000-a-year business here on      hardly any initial investment at all.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ONE FURTHER POINT:</strong> Experiments have shown      us that other brands of refrigerators and freezers seldom      convert into solar collectors as easily as our original      Hotpoint. But that's not as bad as it sounds. In most      cases, it takes only a small amount of trimming and      reshaping to make things fit together the way you want      them. And, at worst, an insulated wooden box can be      fabricated around really odd-sized and-shaped exchanger      coils to make a flat-plate collector ... but there's so      many "good" old refrigerators around that it's just easier      to look a little further and find one that's already      "custom designed" for conversion into a solar panel.    </p>
