    <p>
                            <p>      If Sigrid Shepard's Great-aunt Myra hadn't gone to China as      a missionary, Sigrid might never have written The Thursday      Night Feast and Good Plain Meals Cookbook. And if that had      happened, the English-speaking world would have been      deprived of an exceptionally good culinary book.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Feast</strong> (as Sigrid refers to it) is a hefty      natural foods how-to manual that features the cuisines of      China, Japan, Indonesia, India, and the Middle East. And      not just "features" those cuisines ... but tells you how to      use common or easy-too-btain ingredients to produce over      800 of the most mouthwatering dishes imaginable (none of      which you could call plain, by the way).    </p>    <p>      But-to get back to Aunt Myra-it was she who      first brought the Orient to young Sigrid's attention with      the intriguing gifts she sent home from the other side of      the world. In later years, Sigrid expanded on her Aunt      Myra-inspired early fascination for the East by      becoming expert in first Chinese, then Japanese cuisines      ... and she didn't stop till she'd mastered many of the      best kitchen techniques of the whole Eastern Hemisphere!    </p>    <p>      In her introduction to the book, Sigrid explains how and      why <strong>Feast</strong> came to be: "Like many people at      the beginning of the 70's, I became interested in natural      foods, and I found that Eastern dishes were a "natural" for      this type of food preparation ... the cardinal rule for      both being not to cook out the vitality.    </p>    <p>      "Eastern food is a feast for the eye, the palate, and the      body. The short cooking time and inexpensive ingredients      make it a quick, economical cuisine for busy people who      don't want to live on denatured, prepackaged,      additive-soaked food.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Feast</strong> resulted from the urging of friends      and neighbors who kept asking for recipes and finally      talked me into teaching them for a year of Thursday nights.      The class came to be called the Thursday Night Feast      because we prepared 15 to 20 dishes each meeting and then      feasted on them. Thanks to Margaret Putman's illustrations,      each technique that was demonstrated in class is shown step      by step in the book.    </p>    <p>      "Recipes have been tested repeatedly, so they're easy to      follow and will produce a uniform result ... no matter what      the experience of the cook. Every step-how to saute onions,      how to soak mushrooms, how to deep-fry-is fully      explained each time it's used. All terms are translated or      explained as they occur ... no referring to page 370 when      you're on page 216. The same goes for variations: They're      always directly opposite the main recipe on a two-page      spread.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Feast</strong> , however, is not a culinary      dictator. Many different substitutes are suggested, so that      when you're out of this or low on that there are always      alternate ingredients easy to find in North America.      Elaborate kitchens and equipment are not a must for      preparing Eastern dishes, either. Old-fashioned cast-iron      pots and frying pans and improvised steamers work as well      as woks, karhais, and bamboo steamers, and many of the      feasts have been prepared over Yukon campfires as well as      in fancy urban kitchens.    </p>    <p>      "For both philosophical and economic reasons, the peoples      of the countries covered in this book have subsisted on      lowmeat and vegetarian diets for centuries. Beans, bean      curd, sprouts, lentils, nuts, and seeds are used as a      protein source in place of-or to enhance the limited      use of-expensive meat. So <strong>Feast</strong> is      designed for both vegetarians and meat-eaters. It's low on      the use of eggs and dairy products, and calls for no      monosodium glutamate (MSG).    </p>    <p>      "The major substitutions (to make it a natural foods      cookbook) are honey for sugar, brown rice and whole wheat      for white processed varieties, cold-pressed unsaturated      vegetable oils for animal fat, and sea salt for processed      salt. Cooking methods haven't been changed, because these      cultures are already into a healthful way of cooking.    </p>    <p>      "The recipes feature many herbs and spices-as well as      beans, grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts-but      prepackaged and prepared foods are never used in this      economical, nutritious cuisine. Most of the dishes can be      served hot or cold the next day for lunch or dinner, so      nothing is wasted. In fact, one of the beauties of Eastern      food is that a leftover dinner-with just one or two      dishes added-can turn into a feast.    </p>    <p>      "Sauteing, steaming, stir-frying, deep-frying, and grilling      are the main methods of cooking. Low fuel use and small      stoves with no ovens have dictated these methods,      which-translated to Western kitchens-make for low energy      use. Much time is spent in preparation: grating, slicing,      julienning, chopping, and marinating ... all steps where      others can lend a hand to make the process go faster.      Although many dishes in <strong>Feast</strong> are long on      preparation time, there are also many quick meals that can      be put together in 20 to 30 minutes.    </p>    <p>      "Here in North America, we have one of the richest harvests      the world has ever enjoyed, yet we turn that harvest into a      tasteless nutritional wasteland. <strong>Feast</strong> was      put together to help you discover the simple methods and      fine foods which millions of people for thousands of years      have used to provide themselves with a delicious and      nourishing diet. Whether you eat to live or live to eat,      make it a feast!"    </p>    <p>      Sounds good, and it is! Here, to give you just a      tantalizing sample of the kind of fare Sigrid's kitchen      manual has to offer, are two recipes selected from the      Indian section of her book.    </p>    <p>      BAKED CHICKEN WITH SPICES AND STUFFING    </p>    <p>      1 large roasting chicken or 1 large chicken cut into      pieces<br />      1teaspoon sea salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon black pepper    </p>    <p>      Wash chicken well. Rub with salt and pepper inside and out.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stuffing:</strong><br />      3 tablespoons butter<br />      1/4 cup almonds, chopped fine or slivered<br />      1/4 cup raisins<br />      1/2 teaspoon coriander<br />      1/4 teaspoon cumin<br />      1/4 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/4 teaspoon cardamom<br />      1/4 teaspoon saffron or 1/2 teaspoon turmeric<br />      1/4 teaspoon cloves<br />      1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br />      1 tablespoon honey<br />      3 to 4 cups cooked rice    </p>        <p>      Heat a small cost-iron skillet over medium heat. Add and      melt butter. Add almonds, stirring and trying them for two      to three minutes until they're just brown. Remove from      heat. Add spices (which should be fresh ground, if      possible), raisins, and honey ... and mix well. Then stir      into rice in a large bowl. Stuff chicken with rice, bind      for easy turning, and place on a rack. (Or, if working with      a cut-up bird, place stuffing in a baking dish and cover      with chicken pieces.) Bake at 3250 for 20 to 30 minutes      (until partly done).    </p>    <p>      Masala:    </p>    <p>      2 teaspoons coriander seeds<br />      1 teaspoon cardamom, slightly crushed<br />      1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds<br />      1/4 teaspoon saffron<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon cloves<br />      4 or 5 black peppercorns, parched and crushed    </p>    <p>      While chicken is roasting, mix masala spices well (again,      they should be fresh ground it possible). Set aside.    </p>    <p>      4 tablespoons vegetable oil<br />      1 yellow onion, minced<br />      3 thin slices ginger, minced    </p>    <p>      Heat a small cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add      oil, and heat it until a small piece of onion sizzles in      it. Add onions and ginger, stirring and frying them five to      ten minutes until just tender. Mix with spices and spread      paste over partly baked chicken. Continue to bake for 40 to      50 minutes until done (if you're roasting your chicken      whole, baste it occasionally with drippings), and serve      hot. Serves six.    </p>    <h3>SHRIMP CURRY</h3>    <p>      3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br />      1 medium yellow onion, minced<br />      1/4-inch fresh ginger root, grated<br />      2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped or coriander leaves,      chopped    </p>        <p>      Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil,      and heat until a piece of onion sizzles in it. Add onion,      ginger, and parsley or coriander. Stir and fry five to ten      minutes until onions are soft and transparent but not      brown.    </p>     <p>      2 medium potatoes, cut in 1/4-inch cubes<br />      Add to onion mixture, and stir and try five to ten minutes      until potatoes are half done.<br />      2 medium tomatoes, cut in 1/4-inch cubes, or I cup stewed      tomatoes<br />      3 tablespoons tomato paste<br />      1 teaspoon sea salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br />      1 to 2 teaspoons curry powder    </p>    <p>      Add to potatoes. Mix well, cover, and simmer five to ten      minutes until potatoes are almost done.    </p>    <p>      1/4 to 1/2 pound small shrimp, shelled, deveined, and      steamed five to ten minutes<br />      1 tablespoon lemon juice    </p>        <p>      Add to potatoes and tomatoes, mixing well. Cook three to      five minutes, until most of the liquid is absorbed and the      shrimp are well coated with sauce. Serve hot, with a rice      dish. Serves four to six.    </p>    <p>      <em>Reprinted by permission from The Thursday Night Feast      and Good Plain Meals</em> Cookbook, <em>a $9,95 paperback      by Sigrid M.
