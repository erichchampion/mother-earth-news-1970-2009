                 <p>      "Why put your money in the bank and draw earnings of only      5% or 6% per year," asks Kevin D. Grothe of Minneapolis,      Minnesota, "when you can invest that same money in      'antiques' and earn a return of 200% or 300% or so <em>per      week?</em> " Here's Kevin with all the details.    </p>             <p>      One day the summer before last, I drove out to a farm      auction and spent $7.50 for an old oak armchair, $12 for an      oak rocker, and $10 for a chest of drawers. The very next      day, I rented a space at the local flea market and easily      resold the three pieces of furniture for $120.    </p>        <p>      On a recent Saturday morning with nothing better to do, I      went out looking for bargains at local garage sales. At one      sale, I offered to pay $1.00 each for three dresser drawers      (sans dresser) that had fancy brass pulls. I later removed      the six brass handles, stored the drawers away for some      future use, and sold the pulls to an antique dealer for      $20.    </p>    <p>      At another auction, a final bid of $55 got me a round oak      table that needed some fixing up. After six or eight      pleasurable hours of refinishing, I was able to sell the      handsome table right off my own front porch for a tidy      $150.    </p>    <p>      I could go on and on ... but I think you get the picture. I      buy and sell "previously owned" pieces of furniture for      profit ... sometimes big profit. I work strictly in my      spare time. And, in case you think my success in the      used-furniture biz is unique, it's not: Others have made      (and are now making) money this way, too, and so can you      ... providing, of course, you don't mind setting your own      hours and determining (to a large extent) your own wages!    </p>    <h3>SMALL INVESTMENT, BIG PAYOFF</h3>    <p>      As you've probably noticed (what with the sudden      proliferation of antique shops across the U.S.), antique      furniture is quite popular these days. (This goes for most      any kind of old, wooden furniture, whether it's truly      antique <em>-</em> that is, more than 100 years old      <em>-</em> or not.) You don't need to open a retail      store, however, to cash in on the present popularity of      "antiques". In fact, you don't even need a several      hundred-dollar bankroll to get started in the      used-furniture biz. With as little as $50 (or less, in some      cases) you can head for an auction and come back with      enough salable merchandise to repay your initial investment      several times over.    </p>    <p>      Before you decide to plunge headlong into the furniture      recycling business, however, I'd like to pass along three      pieces of advice based on my experience as a successful      buyer and seller of household goods:    </p>    <p>      [1] Don't expect to get rich quick in this business.      Instead, try to make the venture <em>pleasurable</em> and      <em>educational</em> . The profits will take care of      themselves.    </p>    <p>      [2] Don't invest money that you can't afford to lose (or      have tied up in old furniture for a while). That is to say,      don't finance your foray into the furniture biz with money      which is earmarked for rent, utilities, car payments, etc.      That old dresser you decided to buy may take longer than      you thought it would to resell ... and in the meantime, you      do have to eat.    </p>    <p>      [3] Be honest with yourself and everyone you deal with. The      profit potential in this business is so great that you      should never have to bamboozle a customer out of his or her      money. (Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean you have      to give away all your "trade secrets" to every client that      comes along, either. Let your common sense <em>-</em>      and your conscience-be your guide.)    </p>    <p>      With all this in mind, here's how you can go about making      your spare time more enjoyable-and your spare cash more      abundant-by buying and reselling old furnishings.    </p>    <h3>AUCTIONS: THE BEST SOURCE OF "GOOD BUYS"</h3>        <p>      The small-town auction <em>-</em> that energy-charged      social event where friends and neighbors meet to discuss      the weather, swap stories, and buy goods <em>-</em>      is your best all-round source of future inventory.    </p>    <p>      Auctions are easy to find. Just look in your local paper's      classified section under "Antiques", "Farm Equipment", or      "Livestock". (The ads will usually say something about      "household goods" if furniture or collectables are among      the items to be sold.) Also <em>-</em> if you live in      or near a small town-check for auction notices on bulletin      boards in grocery stores and farm supply outlets.    </p>    <p>      Should you be lucky enough to have an antique dealer as a      friend, you might be able to get him or her to put your      name on the mailing list of one or more of the many flyers      mailed out by the auctioneers themselves. (You can also      approach the auctioneer at any sale you attend and ask if      he mails out notices. It won't hurt to inquire.)    </p>    <p>      When you're choosing auctions to attend, stick with the      ones held on a weekday and located 50 miles or more from      the nearest large city. These sales are usually only      attended by local people and farmers (and maybe a few      antique dealers) ... folks who aren't willing to pay the      higher prices that are common at big-city auctions (and      sales held on weekends).    </p>    <p>      Also, consider bad weather an asset when you venture out to      buy. Auctions and sales invariably go on regardless of      weather conditions. When it rains or snows, however, fewer      people show up ... resulting in less competition during the      bidding and <em>-</em> therefore <em>-</em>      lower prices.    </p>    <p>      Try to arrive at each of the events you attend at least a      half hour early, and preferably a full hour. This will give      you ample time to inspect the merchandise. I recommend that      you carry a pad and pen and write down the names of the      items you're likeliest to buy (and what prices you're      prepared to pay for them) as you walk around. These notes      may keep you from paying more than you should for an item      during the excitement of bidding. (It's been known to      happen!)    </p>    <p>      When the appointed time comes, the auctioneer will step      forward and loudly announce that he is going to begin.      He'll state the terms and methods he will use, and the      general order of what he's going to sell first and the      items he'll get to last. Then he'll stutter and stammer,      wheeze and holler until the item on the block (be it a      table, hay wagon, or whatever) is sold to the highest      bidder.    </p>    <p>      The main thing to remember is to stay alert and pay close      attention to what's being bidded upon. You'll be amazed,      sometimes, at how fast the bidding will be. If you're not      quick enough-or vocal enough-your bid may go unnoticed ...      or you may find that you've bought a rusty old washtub      instead of that nice oak rocker you had your eye on. So      stay on your toes!    </p>    <p>      Also, when you do manage to get that final bid in, be sure      to jot down the name of the item-and your final offer-on      the back of your bidding card. Do this each time you "buy"      a piece, so that you'll be able to keep track of your total      spending as the night (or afternoon) wears on.    </p>    <h3>ANOTHER GOOD SOURCE OF INVENTORY: ESTATE      SALES</h3>        <p>      An "estate sale" occurs when someone decides      <em>-</em> for whatever reason (divorce, death, etc.)      <em>-</em> to sell everything that isn't bolted down      in a home. More often than not, the house's owner will hire      a professional to do the pricing (all items at these events      are pre-priced right where they sit) and conduct the sale.      For this reason, the goods sold at estate sales are often      no less expensive than the equivalent items would be in an      antique shop.    </p>    <p>      It's sad but true: Estate sales are becoming more and more      a seller's market every day ... mainly because of the      throngs of people that flock to these gatherings at the      first sight of an ad in the paper. Still, if you have a      sharp eye and you're in the right place at the right time,      you <em>can</em> make some good buys at these events.    </p>    <p>      The best estate sales to go to (from the standpoint of low      prices) are those that are little advertised and which      occur in small towns. Arrive at these sales either very      early, when there is still a lot of unsold merchandise, or      very late (when many buyers have gone home, causing the      prices of the few remaining unsold items <em>-</em>      in many cases <em>-</em> to be cut in half).    </p>    <p>      Garage or yard sales are not really in the same category as      estate sales, but the same shopping principles hold true.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO BUY MERCHANDISE THAT WILL SELL</h3>    <p>      When you're looking at furniture (whether it's truly      antique or just old), stick with pieces made of one of the      hardwoods: oak, ash, walnut, teak, maple, mahogany, etc.      (If you aren't able to identify the type of wood from the      appearance of its grain, check the item's weight. If the      piece is heavy for its size, it's probably made of a      hardwood.)    </p>    <p>      Also, buy only well <em>-</em> constructed furniture.      Forget about items held together just by nails. Check to      see that the chair, bench, chest, desk, etc., which you're      considering is professionally glued or screwed together and      has no warped pieces. Generally speaking, any item of      furniture that features pressed wood designs, turned or      carved legs, or other fancy parts will be in demand and      will sell.    </p>    <p>      Whatever you do, <em>don't</em> buy any piece of furniture      that's badly gouged, has missing pieces, or is broken or      cracked beyond easy repair. Major furniture reconstruction      is best left to experts. ( <em>Refinishing</em> , though,      is something you may well want to try. See the accompanying      sidebar.)    </p>    <p>      Avoid buying dishes or glassware altogether, unless you      have some special knowledge in this area. The market for      glassware is simply too unpredictable ... and the country      is flooded right now with reproductions of authentic      collectable china, crystal, and porcelain artifacts      (reproductions that <em>-</em> to the untrained eye      <em>-</em> can't be told from the "real thing"). If      you simply <em>must</em> have a particular piece, at least      look for a brand name stamped on the bottom. (A few of the      many names you can depend on for good value are: Heisy,      Steuben, Noritake, Occupied Japan, Roseville, Wedgewood,      Nippon, and Red Wing. <em>Beware of chips and cracks.</em>      )    </p>        <p>      As for collectables: Anything with visible nostalgic value      that was made more than 20 years ago is probably being      collected by someone somewhere. This includes old toys      (metallic or wooden), radios, advertising gimmicks,      magazines, books, sheet music, postcards, military      paraphernalia, kitchen utensils ... you name it. (I know      one guy who collects old doorknobs!) If you think an item      can be resold, buy it.    </p>    <p>      Don't be af raid to bid on " mystery boxes", either. Most      often such boxes go for only a couple of dollars, and yet      the treasures inside are frequently worth many times the      selling price. All I can say is, I've yet to regret buying      one of these "grab boxes".    </p>    <h3>HOW TO PRICE YOUR WARES</h3>    <p>      If you have any doubt as to how much money a given item is      worth, go to a large bookstore or library and look through      the many available books on collectables and their values.      (You'll probably be surprised at just how many books of      this type there are. A few of the better ones are listed at      the end of this article.)    </p>    <p>      Another thing you can do is visit as many antique shops as      you can find and browse through their stock, taking note of      the prices. These shops are <em>-</em> without a      doubt <em>-</em> the best all-around guide to prices      in your area. If you're not sure what the going tariff is      for, say, maple desks ... all you have to do is visit a      store that has a desk similar to yours, and price your      piece accordingly.    </p>    <p>      If <em>-</em> on the other hand <em>-</em> you      can't find anything in local antique stores that resembles      the oddity you've just bought, ask a dealer what he would      pay (wholesale) for the item ... then price your piece 50%      higher. (This method isn't always reliable and should be      used as a last resort.) Ideally, of course, you should      always attempt to learn the market value of things      <em>before</em> you buy them.    </p>    <p>      As a rule of thumb, it's a good idea to ask yourself      <em>-</em> whenever you're considering a purchase      <em>-</em> "Could I make a profit of 50% on this      item?" If the answer is "no" . . . go on to the next piece      (unless, of course, you plan to keep the item after you buy      it).    </p>    <h3>TRANSPORTATION NEEDS</h3>    <p>      You can use most any kind of vehicle <em>-</em> from      Volkswagen to dump truck <em>-</em> to haul your      purchases home, although <em>-</em> naturally      <em>-</em> a pickup or van is best. (If you don't own      a vehicle, perhaps you can enlist the services of a      friend.)    </p>    <p>      Whatever form of transportation you use, though, don't make      the mistake of buying more goods than you can haul home in      one trip. At most auctions and estate sales, sold items      must be removed immediately (or at least on the same day).    </p>    <p>      Loading, by the way, is no problem: Someone will always be      available to help you stash that bulky oak dresser in the      back of the truck. Do be sure, however, to bring blankets      or tarps to use as padding when you're packing more than      one precious antique into your vehicle.    </p>    <h3>SELLING YOUR WARES</h3>    <p>      There are basically three ways to get the most out of your      wares, once you're ready to sell:    </p>    <p>      [1] Reserve a space at a swap meet,<br />      [2] run an ad in the paper, or<br />      [3] hold your own garage or yard sale.    </p>    <p>      Flea markets and swap meets are probably among the best      ways to "move" your merchandise, simply because of the huge      number of people who shop in this manner. Booth space at      these open-air markets (which are usually held at drive-in      theaters and shopping centers) costs from $1.50 to $5.00      per space assignment per day ... which is more than      reasonable, when you consider that as many as 5,000 to      50,000 shoppers may see your goods in a day's time.    </p>    <p>      If you decide to go this route, try to arrive early (7:00      or 8:00 a.m.) and stake out a good spot. (Sometimes, you'll      be required to make advance reservations. Check it out.)      Bring along a folding card table (more than one, if      necessary) to set your smaller items on. If nothing else,      throw a nice blanket on the ground ... it'll make a      passable and effective display.    </p>    <p>      Organize your wares so that your customers will find it      easy to browse, and so people won't knock your breakables      over or step on your magazines to get a better look at that      painting way in the back. And set your prices a good 10 or      20% higher than what you actually expect to get for each      piece of merchandise. This way, the shopper has a chance to      "dicker" on the price (as is customary at swap meets).    </p>    <p>      Then again <em>-</em> rather than go to a swap meet      <em>-</em> you may want to run a classified ad under      the appropriate heading of your local newspaper. Advertise      your most interesting items only, and keep the ad itself      short. (This will prompt interested parties to call for      more information.) Include the price in your advertisement      only if you consider it to be an especially low one.    </p>    <p>      If you prefer to hold your own garage, porch, yard, or      living room sale, that's easy too. Run a short ad in the      paper or just put up signs on strategic street corners. If      you live on a particularly busy thorough <em>-</em>      fare, you won't have to advertise at all ... just set your      inventory in plain view, and customers will begin to      gravitate to your house. Before you go this route, however,      be sure to check local ordinances. (Some municipalities      have restrictions on the number of sales you may hold per      year others issue special licenses.)    </p>    <h3>THE PROFIT PICTURE</h3>    <p>      By now you're probably wondering how much money a person      can expect to make buying and selling pre-owned household      goods. It's hard to give a definite, dollars-and- cents      answer, since the profit on your investment can range from      zero to several hundred percent, and since you can approach      this business either full time or (as I do) part time.      Roughly speaking, though <em>-</em> if you hustle and      if you have a good eye for items that will sell      <em>-</em> you can count on grossing between $200 and      $400 a week on an investment of $50 to $100 ... working      only 15 to 20 hours! (That's on the <em>average</em> . As I      mentioned at the beginning of this article, I've made as      much as $90 a day <em>-</em> and more      <em>-</em> in this lucrative field.)    </p>    <h3>A FINAL WORD</h3>    <p>      If the idea of selling a piece of furniture for four times      what you paid for it makes you feel a little like a      "capitalist pig" . . . perhaps you're not cut out for this      kind of highprofit enterprise. Just remember, though, that      antique dealers charge whatever they feel they can get for      their wares, even if they picked up the merchandise for      free. (And don't forget that their customers are usually      happy to pay every penny of the purchase price, or else      they wouldn't buy the items[s] in the first place.)    </p>    <p>      Not that it isn't a good idea to practice a little kindness      now and then by passing a savings on to your customer. If I      get an exceptional deal on an item, I pass the savings      right on to the next lucky person ... and so should you.      When and if you cross paths with this individual again,      you'll certainly be remembered ... either as a fool or a      friend. (It doesn't matter which. The customer will still      be more likely to buy from you the second time around.)    </p>    <p>      The used furniture business isn't for everybody. It's just      for people who don't mind going to swap meets and auctions,      surrounding themselves with fine old pieces of furniture,      and earning $200 a week (or more) in their spare time. I      know that includes <em>me</em> ... maybe it does you, too!    </p>    <p>      1. <em>Antiquing From A to Z</em> by Michael DeForrest      (Simon & Schuster, 1975).

Hard cover. $6.95    </p>    <p>      5. <em>Primer of American Antiques</em> by Carl W. Drepperd      (Doubleday, 1944). Hard cover, $5.95    </p>    <p>      Oftentimes in your search for good used furniture you'll      encounter a strikingly beautiful chest, rocking chair, or      other item that could be even <em>more</em> strikingly      beautiful if the object weren't painted algae green or mud      brown. When this happens, don't pass the piece up ...      instead, buy it and refinish it. Afterwards, you'll have an      item that's much more valuable <em>-</em> and much      more marketable <em>-</em> than it would otherwise      have been.    </p>    <p>      It's not difficult to refinish furniture. Here's what      you'll need in the way of supplies:    </p>    <p>      [1] A couple of paint brushes.    </p>    <p>      [2] Light-bodied furniture stripper.    </p>    <p>      [3] No. 2 steel wool and cotton rags.    </p>    <p>      [4] Small tools (toothpicks, nail files, etc.) for working      the paint out of deep crevices in the wood.    </p>    <p>      [5] Furniture stain (optional).    </p>    <p>      [6] Varnish, wax, boiled linseed oil, or tung oil (as      desired).    </p>    <p>      [7] A well-ventilated working area.    </p>    <p>      Follow the manufacturer's direc tions when you work with      the stripper. Try to avoid breathing the fumes, and      whatever you do, don't smoke or light a match ... most      light-bodied finish removers are exceedingly flammable.    </p>    <p>      After you've removed the old finish from the chest, chair,      or whatever, it's time to put on a new preservative. I      prefer boiled linseed oil, since it [1] can be applied      easily with a soft cloth, [2] keeps wood from drying out,      and [3] brings out the true beauty of the grain. (Also,      linseed oil has a non-toxic and-in my opinion      <em>-</em> pleasing odor.) The oil's only drawback is      that it takes a long time to dry ... two or three days,      depending on temperature and humidity. Apply two to three      coats for a nice, uniform finish, and allow the object to      dry completely between coats.    </p>    <p>      After you've stripped and ref inished a couple of pieces of      furniture, you'll have gotten the hang of the operation ...      and you'll be well on your way to earning higher profits in      the used furniture biz. <em>-KG</em> .    </p>
