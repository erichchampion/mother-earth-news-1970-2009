                           <h5 id="byline">by PAULA NEWCOMER</h5>          <p>      Quilted wall hangings make a colorful addition to any      room...and they aren't as hard to make as you might think.    </p>    <p>      Maybe you'd like to make good use of those long winter      nights that you're now spending curled up by the fire. And      maybe you'd also like to recycle some of the many      attractive scraps of material you've saved over the years.      But <em>-</em> and here's the worst "maybe" of      all-maybe the sheer logistics of making a quilt have      intimidated you enough to keep you from giving it a try.      Well, If that's your situation . . . perhaps you should try      your hand on a padded applique wall hanging.    </p>        <p>      The machine-applique "wood stove" wall hanging shown in the      accompanying photos is <em>-</em> I'm proud to say      <em>-</em> an original design: I made it as a gift      for a friend. ("Rebecca," I said, "here's your-own personal      'padded room'. Bounce off that for a while!") My friend was      delighted. So was I, because the whole thing took less than      a week to complete <em>-</em> working nights only      <em>-</em> and the 'total cost for the project was      under $6.00.    </p>   <h3> YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEAN ARTIST</h3>    <p>      The great thing about applique is that you don't have to be      a Picasso to create stunningly beautiful designs. If      there's a particular part of your homestead that you find      especially attractive, you can make a simple sketch of it      and translate some of that beauty into a highly original      piece of folk art. You might want to capture some trees,      against a sunset say, or a portion of the barn and field      (with a farming implement or two thrown in, perhaps) ... or      something funky in the way of an indoor scene, such as an      old-timey bathtub (for the bathroom wall, naturally).    </p>    <p>      Then again, you don't have to copy real <em>-</em> life      objects ... you can also create your own thematic designs.      Bold, simple shapes are the most effective. The texture of      the material you use (and the underlying padding) will      eliminate the need for a great amount of detail ...      although if you want to get fancy, you can add some      interesting touches with bits of embroidery here and there.    </p>    <h3>THE "ROUNDED" LOOK</h3>        <p>      The wall hangings I make (see the accompanying photographs)      have a kind of three-dimensional quality, a depth and      richness that ordinary flat applique can't match. My      secret: I pad each element of the picture as it is applied      to the cotton fabric "front" . . . and I pad the entire      piece again when I put the backing on. This way, it's      possible to get a "rounded" look without having to stitch      through five or six layers of tatting all at once.    </p>   <h3>WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO GET STARTED</h3>    <p>      If you do any sewing at all, chances you already have most      of the necessary starting materials on hand. All I had to      buy to make Rebecca's wall covering was [1] the solid white      cotton fabric that constitutes the piece of work's front      and back, and [2] a $2.88 package of polyester batting      (from which I had enough left over to pad two smaller wall      coverings later). By dipping into the scrap bag, its easy      to keep costs to a minimum.    </p>    <p>      Here's a complete list of the tools and materials you'll      need to make a 31' X 31" wall hanging:    </p>    <p>      TOOLS    </p>    <p>      [1] A zigzag-type sewing machine    </p>    <p>      [2] Scissors    </p>    <p>      [3] Straight pins    </p>    <p>      [4] Embroidery needles and hoop    </p>    <p>      [5] A yardstick or ruler    </p>    <p>      [6] Chalk and/or a pencil and pen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MATERIALS</strong>    </p>    <p>      [1] One 32' X 32" sheet of heavy drawing paper (or several      smaller sheets taped together)    </p>    <p>      [2] Two 36" X 36" pieces of heavy cotton fabric    </p>    <p>      [3] Odd scraps of material    </p>    <p>      [4] Regular sewing thread    </p>    <p>      [5] Embroidery floss in a variety of colors    </p>    <p>      [6] One package of 100% polyester fiber (layer-built      batting)    </p>    <p>      [7] Seam tape (optional)    </p>    <p>      [8] A 32"-long wooden dowel (optional).    </p>   <h3>HOW TO SELECT FABRICS FOR MACHINE APPLIQUE</h3>        <p>      Applique <em>-</em> which began as a way to patch      worn clothes <em>-</em> is simply a technique for      applying one fabric to another. There are various ways to      do this, but the method I use is the quickest and easiest:      It's called <em>machine applique.</em>    </p>    <p>      In machine applique, small pieces of material are cut to      shape, then zigzag-stitched along their rough edges to a      larger piece of cloth. It's essential to use heavy cotton      or firm, non-fraying fabrics for this method. By choosing      firm fabrics from your scrap bag, you can avoid the      laborious finishing off and handstitching operations that      usually accompany applique. (Not that I don't enjoy      handwork ... I do But I'd rather save this kind of work for      decorative embroidery stitches, where I can get as      elaborate as I want.)    </p>    <h3>HOW TO ADJUST YOUR MACHINE</h3>    <p>      I use a fairly wide zigzag stitch (four or five on my      dial), and I recommend that you do likewise. (You can      regulate this as desired, however.) Place the dial on      "satin stitch" . . . close to zero on most machines. And be      sure to use a medium to heavy machine needle (size 14 to      16) for this kind of multiple-fabric stitching.    </p>    <h3>BEGIN BY MAKING A PATTERN</h3>    <p>      First make a small sketch of your design (and      <em>please</em> , keep the figures simple). Then      <em>-</em> when you've got something you like-redraw      the scene on a 321 X 32" sheet of paper in actual size,      leaving a 2" border around the artwork. (This gives you      room for a 1" seam allowance and lets you top-stitch 1" in      from the outer edge.) This sheet is your paper pattern.    </p>    <p>      The first thing you should do with the pattern is lay it      down on your "background" fabric and cut around the pattern      to make a 32" X 32" square of material. Do this with both      the 36" X 36" pieces of heavy cotton fabric. (These squares      will, of course, form the front and back of your finished      wall hanging.)    </p>    <p>      Next, cut the individual design shapes from your pattern      and trace their Putlines onto the scrap-bag pieces of      fabric that will be used in your finished wall hanging.      (Use pencil if your fabric is light-colored ... chalk when      the material is dark.) Also trace the outline of each      design element onto the back. ground fabric (again using      pencil or chalk as appropriate).    </p>    <p>      As you trace around the paper patterns and cut out the      applique pieces, remember that you'll achieve the best      results with bold textures and color combinations.    </p>    <h3>EMBROIDERY</h3>    <p>      If you plan to embroider details onto any of your      applique's components, leave plenty of room around the      edges of each piece as you trace the design onto the fabric      so you'll be able to get your embroidery hoop around the      work. Then <em>-after</em> you've embroidered-you can      cut away the excess material.    </p>        <p>      I used very simple stitches, incidentally, on the      individual design elements of the "wood stove wall hanging      shown in the accompanying photographs. Chain stitches, for      instance, run in alternating colors across the rug, chain      stitching makes up the stove's "burners", chain stitching      and backstitching are used on the barrel motif, and      backstitching and French knots on the kerosene lamp. (See      the accompanying diagrams for information on how to do this      embroidery.)    </p>   <h3>LAYOUT</h3>    <p>      Now snuggle up close to the fireplace, spread out one of      your 32" squares of material, and lay the pieces of your      design out on the fabric. (Hint: If you'll place a 32" X      32" or larger piece of plywood or cardboard beneath the      square of cloth, your work will be easily portable for      cleanup, and the back of the fabric will stay clean.) And      by all means do experiment with different juxtapositions of      design elements and different types of material ... you may      discover some particularly striking combinations.      (Originally, for example, I had planned to use a solid      fabric for the stove doors in my "wood stove" wall hanging      ... but after a little trial and error, I found that a      print looked more interesting.)    </p>   <h3> PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</h3>    <p>      When you're satisfied with the layout, you're ready to move      to the sewing machine. (Or <em>-</em> better yet      <em>-</em> move the sewing machine closer to the      fire.) I find it's easier to apply the larger pieces first.      And here's how to prepare the "stuffing" for one of these      items:    </p>    <p>      First, trace the original paper pattern onto the layered      batting. (Use a triple thickness of batting for most large      pieces ... more for those items you really want to pop      out.) You can work with a pen or felt-tip marker here,      since you'll want to cut <em>inside</em> the lines and make      the batting a fraction of an inch smaller all the way      around than the piece of fabric that it will "fill".    </p>    <p>      Next, place the batting underneath the corresponding piece      of applique and hand-baste (close to the edge) through both      onto the 32" X 32" fabric front. After you've done several      pieces, you'll probably be adept enough to forgo the      basting process and pin the pieces directly onto the square      of cloth.    </p>    <p>      Now you're ready to machine stitch. (if you've never tried      this before, it wouldn't be a bad idea to practice on some      scraps first before you attempt the real thing. One      advantage of machine applique <em>-</em> you'll      notice <em>-</em> is that you can use contrasting      thread around the edges of each piece of fabric, which      really helps to define the design.) As you zigzag over the      raw edge, try to keep the machine moving . . . but don't      "force" the fabric. What you're aiming for is a smooth,      even satin stitch. Finish each applique by backstitching      and clipping the loose ends of the threads.    </p>    <p>      On smaller pieces <em>-</em> such as plant leaves      (see photos) <em>-</em> I'll stitch nearly all the      way around the piece, stuff tufts of batting into the leaf      to plump it up (lamb's wool works great, if you have sheep      on your homestead), then close up the edge.    </p>    <h3>FINISHING TOUCHES</h3>    <p>      After all the design pieces have been appliqued to the      front 32-inch square of cloth, it's a good idea to iron      your future wall hanging. Just press around the edges of      the zigzag stitching (on the wrong side only) ... never      directly on the padded areas.    </p>    <p>      OK. Now you're ready to put the backing on. (Note: Hidden      loops <em>-</em> through which a dowel may be      inserted for hanging the finished piece <em>-</em>      can be added to the backing. See accompanying      Illustrations.) First cut out a 32-inch square of polyester      batting. (I prefer to use three or four layers.) Next,      place the front and back pieces of 32-inch-square fabric      together (right side to right side), lay the square of      batting on top of the back panel, and pin all three pieces      together.    </p>    <p>      Now sew 1" in from the edge and all the way around the      square <em>except</em> for a 6"-long area left open at the      center of the bottom edge. I find that if I use thin      tracing paper or seam tape <em>-</em> or the paper,      cut into strips, that comes between the folds of batting      <em>-</em> along the seam line between the sewing      machine needle and the batting, I don't have problems with      the machine's pressure foot catching or tearing the      stuffing.    </p>    <p>      Next, trim the bottom seam to 1/2" and all other seams to      1/4". Clip the corners, then <em>carefully</em> turn the      hanging right side out through the 6" opening and push out      the corners. Turn the 6"- long open area at the bottom      under and close it up by hand with a simple slip stitch.    </p>    <p>      Finally, using the satin stitch setting on your machine,      top-stitch through all thicknesses of the wall covering an      inch in from the piece's outer edges. This helps hold the      batting tightly in place when the piece is hanging. (For      the "wood stove" design shown here, I also top-stitched      through all thicknesses along the lines that define the      "padded room".)    </p>    <p>      There you have it: your own uniquely original, colorful,      and three-dimensional applique wall hanging to brighten up      the old homestead. Who knows ... maybe <em>-</em> if      you really enjoy this craft <em>-</em> Will want to      make several wall coverings in the same theme, then sew 'em      together to create one smashingly beautiful quilt. (And you      thought you didn't have time to make quilts!)    </p>  <h3> HOW TO MAKE LOOPS ON THE BACK OF YOUR WALL      HANGING</h3>          <p>      Cut out four strips of fabric, 3" long by 2" wide.    </p>        <p>      Fold long edges in towards the middle and zigzag down the      center across raw edges.    </p>        <p>      Measure down 2-1/2" from top of the wall hanging's backing      and 2-1/2" in from each side. Pin the bottom edge of each      corner loop to the backing (right sides together). Space      other loops out evenly across back, also 2-1/2" from the      top, and pin.    </p>           <p>      Zigzag several times across bottom edge of loops, as shown.    </p>        <p>      Fold loop down and under. Adjust to size of dowel. Stitch      across bottom fold several times.    </p>        <p>      Finished loop looks like this.    </p>      <h3>SOME SIMPLE EMBROIDERY STITCHES</h3>        <p>      BACKSTITCH: This <em>-</em> one of the easiest and      most useful of embroidery stitches <em>-</em> can be      used to outline shapes and embroider curved lines. It is      worked from right to left, as follows: Bring the needle      through to the front side of the cloth and make a small      stitch backward (i.e., to the right) ... then bring the      needle through again to the left of the first stitch and      make <em>another</em> backstitch to the start of the first      stitch, and so on.    </p>        <p>      CHAIN STITCH: The chain stitch can help you cover a lot of      space quickly ... and attractively. Just <em>how</em>      quickly depends on how big you make the "loops". First      bring the needle through to the fabric's front side. Next,      hold the thread down with your left hand and insert the      needle back through the cloth very close to where it first      emerged. Then bring the point of the needle up through the      cloth a second time in front of your first entry point.      Pull the needle through, while you keep the thread under      its point so that the next stitch holds it down against the      face of the fabric in a loop.    </p>        <p>      FRENCH KNOTS: Here, each "stitch" resembles a dot or bead.      First pull your needle through from the back to your      cloth's front side. Next take the working thread in your      left hand and wind It two or three times around the needle,      close to its point. Then <em>-</em> while you hold      the thread taut in the left hand <em>-</em> insert      the needle close to where it first emerged. Now either pull      the needle through to the back of the cloth and tie off the      stitch, or <em>-</em> if you intend to make a series      of French knots <em>-</em> bring the needle through      to the front of the fabric again in position for the next      stitch.    </p>
