                         <p>      The smiling man with the mallet and gouge is Paul N. Luvera      Sr. And Paul <em>-</em> who's nearing the start of      his ninth decade on this planet he just written and      self-published an unusual book titled <em>How to Curve      Totem Poles.</em>    </p>        <p>      No, Mr. Luvera isn't really a writer ... or a publisher ...      or even a wood-carver. (He spent most of his life as a      grocer.) But everybody at some point in his or her life      falls in love with totem poles, right? And an awful lot of      us secretly believer-way down in our most secret heart of      hearts <em>-</em> that we could write a book, don't      we? And all of us love a good story in which the main      character (say someone who has written a book) gets the      cold shoulder again and again (from, maybe, as many as 23      "real" publishers) ... but who wins in the end by gritting      his teeth, publishing his own book, and then watching that      book become a big success.    </p>        <p>      Well, the hero in this case isn't any cardboard character      from a cheap TV program. The hero is real, live,      grandfather-of-14 Paul N. Luvera, Sr Who really was a      grocer most of his life. Who really did fall in love with      totem poles at some point in his life. Who eventually      learned enough about this native North American art to      write a book on the subject Who saw that book turned down      by 23 "real" publishers. Who then took the bit in his teeth      and self-published the manual himself. And who has already      watched his original 5,000 copies of the guide sell so well      ... that he's currently going back on press for another      run!    </p>        <p>      And the reason that Paul is selling out of How to Carve      Totem Poles is because the book so lovingly tells precisely      how to create a totem just as impressive as the one to the      right. And it just as lovingly details a great deal more      about the traditions of the Northwest native peoples of      this continent (who, as you know, are famous for their      totems). And because it also tells you how to carve and      assemble other things such as the beautiful cradle below      ... which, believe it or not, was put to gether without a      single screw or nail. And because a chapter in the book by      Paul's wife, Mary, explains the proper way in which to      paint a totem to give it an authentic look. And just      because.    </p>    <p>      How to Carve Totem Poles is a large (8-1/2 X 11) paperback,      It con. tains a number of color plates and many black and      white Illustrations, and there's nothing else like it      around for $11.95. You can order it directly -from the      author by sending your $11.95 to Mr. Paul N. Luvera, Sr.,      2102 9th St., Anacortes, Wash. 98221.    </p>
