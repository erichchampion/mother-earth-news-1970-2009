        <p><strong>1839</strong> Edmund Becquerel, a French physicist, observes the photovoltaic effect.</p><p><strong>1880s</strong> Selenium PV cells are built that convert light in the visible spectrum into electricity - they're 1% to 2% efficient. Light sensors for cameras are made from selenium to this day.</p><p>In the early <strong>1950s</strong> the Czochralski meter is developed for producing pure crystalline silicon.</p><p>In <strong>1954</strong> Bell Telephone Laboratories produces a silicon PV cell with a 4% efficiency, which eventually graduates to 11% efficiency.</p><p>In <strong>1958</strong> the U.S. Vanguard space satellite (above) uses a small (less than one watt) array to power its radio. The space program has played an important role in the development of PVs ever since.</p><p>During the <strong>1973-74</strong> oil embargo the U.S. Department of Energy funds the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program, resulting in the installation and testing of more than 3,100 PV systems, many of which continue to operate.</p><p>From the <strong>1970</strong><strong>s</strong> through the <strong>1990s</strong>, North American interest in solar power wanes. Majority ownership of many United States PV manufacturers transfers to German and Japanese interests.</p>
