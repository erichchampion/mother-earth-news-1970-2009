                <p>      Orphaned piglets (or starving runts) don't have to die.      After a few weeks of tender care, they'll be able to look      after themselves . . . while they put on hundreds of pounds      of potential pork.    </p>            <h3>      Lena Anken Sexton			</h3>			<p>			I slipped Smilie's harness over his fat little shoulders and attached the      leash ... and we began our midday constitutional along the      banks of Idaho's glorious Salmon River. Pretty soon, a      pickup truck came up the twisting river road,      and-with a protest of brakes-it whipped to a      stop beside us.</p><p>"By golly!" the driver exclaimed. "Now I've      seen everything!" </p><p>"I like pigs," I answered with a big grin      .. and I'll bet that once you've had a chance to share your      home-if only for a few weeks-with one of these      delightful creatures, you'll come to be fond of them, too.      When little orphaned Smilie was only three weeks old, for      instance, he already thought he was a person. He would clip      up and down my kitchen floor, playing with the cat and      squealing for chow.</p><p> But keeping a pig in the house? Yes      indeed! Many piglets have shared my home for two or three      weeks, until they could build up enough strength to survive      on their own. In fact, a pig is-or can      become-more mannerly and intelligent than a dog      (we've even had pigs that helped us bring home the cows)      and as clean as a cat .. . and swine don't shed hair!</p><p>      However, unless you intend to keep your orphan for      breeding, don't make it a real pet: It's simply not a good      idea to become terribly attached to an animal that may be a      future Christmas ham. On the other hand, do be kind to your      porcine babies. Any infant-even a pig-needs      love if it's to thrive.			</p>			<h3>			WHY BOTHER?			</h3>			<p>			 When you consider the price of meat today, you'll realize that      the loss of a litter of pigs-or even of a single      runt-can be an expensive proposition. Over the last      ten years, I've had many occasions to rescue from one to      ten piglets at a shot . .. and each of those efforts has      been, in my opinion, time and trouble well spent.</p><p>      Furthermore, the little animals (which, in many cases,      would be doomed if someone didn't adopt them) can be a      source of free livestock for the farmstead-on-a-budget.      Check with pork producers in your area . . . find out a few      farrowing dates . . . and ask whether you might have (or      buy, at a very low cost) an orphan or a runt from one of      the litters.</p><p> As a last resort, you can settle for a cripple      . . . even these animals can sometimes be saved. For      example, Felix-our last foster pig-had been      pen-injured. He was unable to stand when we got him, and      spent part of each day hung in a sling made from torn      sheets. Felix is now a picture of health, weighs 200      pounds, and will soon be ready for the smokehouse.    </p>		<h3>		CLEAN AND WARM		</h3>		<p>		 Once you have your orphan,there are several facts to keep in mind. First, more baby      pigs die from being chilled than from any other cause. They      come from a warm womb (over 100°F) and must be kept at      90-95°F for the first few hours of their lives. From      then on, the tiny sucklings will thrive in 75 ° to 95      ° temperatures.</p><p> Second, a piglet's surroundings should      be kept as clean as those of a human baby (I even boil my      orphans' eating utensils for the first few days), because      shoats are born with no immunities at all. The young      animals normally get such biological safeguards from      colostrum (the mother's first milk), and if a baby pig is      denied this protection, it will be quite susceptible to      bacterial infection.</p><p> Third, remember that the poor mite has      been rejected. Its mother is dead or sick, or perhaps the      piglet has been shoved away from a life-giving teat by      stronger, more dominant littermates. Either way, it will be      hungry and cold when you bring it home.</p><p> For all these      reasons, as soon as I acquire an orphan, I bathe it in      warm, soapy water ... paying particular attention to hoofs,      ears, eyes, and the sides of the face. (It may take more      than one bath to soak off dried dirt.) My husband has often      brought me a limp little newborn . . . shivering and      scarcely breathing. You'd be surprised at the new life a      good soak in warm water will put into such abandoned      babies.</p><p> Once the tiny creature is clean, you can wrap it in      a warm towel and rub it briskly (but not too hard) to get      its blood circulating ... and, thereafter, keep your new      charge warm and out of drafts.			</p>			<h3>			FOOD FIT FOR A PIGLET			</h3>			<p>			We always have a little stock of pig suckle      on hand for emergencies. (Several brands are available at      feed stores, but don't try to substitute lamb or calf      suckle, as the protein requirement for each type of animal      is different.)</p><p> When raising Smilie, our first orphan (he      was given to me by a friend, before our family began to      raise pigs), I used regular baby formula, but the wee one      had some trouble digesting it. If you don't have access to      pig suckle, though, you can use cow's milk served at      100°F. Don't add cream or sugar, but skim milk      powder-at a ratio of one tablespoon per pint of fluid      milk-is a worthwhile supplement.</p><p> If you have only one      or two pigs to feed, forget using a bottle ... it'll just      make weaning more difficult. Instead, use a teaspoon.      Here's how: Once your new houseguest is clean, warm, and      wrapped tightly in a towel, gather the baby up against your      left side with its head facing right (or the reverse, if      you're left-handed). Hold its body with your left arm and      its head in your left hand, then-with the teaspoon in      your right hand-force the warm suckle into its mouth.</p><p>      The piglet will struggle and spill a lot, but be      persistent. Feed it a bit every hour at first, and      gradually space out the meals. After each feeding, simply      wipe off the pig's face and put the baby in a box to sleep.      The small creature has a built-in alarm and will soon begin      to let you know when it's hungry. Early on, however,      especially if the baby is weak, you'll have to do its      thinking.</p><p> As your little boarder learns to eat, graduate      him or her to a tablespoon and then-as quickly as      possible-to a teacup. Within a day or two, you can      soften a few baby-pig pellets in the formula, and increase      the quantity day by day to thicken the gruel. Before you      know it, your pig will be running to you when it's hungry,      and eating from a longhandled dipper or fruit ladle.</p><p> At      this point, you'll want to plan for the time (within two or      three weeks) when the piglet will be out of the house and      more or less on its own. We've built an orphanage just      outside our kitchen door. It's a small pen with a discarded      birdfeeder for shelter, and a self-feeder that I keep      stocked with pellets and leafy greens . . . to encourage      the little porker to broaden its eating horizons. This      setup saves me a million steps, since I can just pop out      with a dipper and feed the current occupant. The whole pen      is portable, too, which makes each orphan's eventual      transfer to the regular pigpen an easy task.			</p>			<h3>			A LITTER BIT MORE			</h3>			<p>			 One pig can be a pet . . . but      eight pigs are simply eight little hogs. One is always      hungry ahead of the rest . . . that one will unfailingly      awaken the entire crew . . . and feedings can get downright      complicated.			</p>			<p>			 So when I find myself with a whole orphaned      litter to care for, I generally resort to using big      softdrink bottles, fitted with lamb nipples, at feeding      time. These groups of little ones live in a huge furniture      box spread with lots of newspaper and a layer of straw.      Beside it, I keep a big straw-filled "dining room" tub. The      solid footing provided by the straw helps the piglets feel      secure while they have their meals . . . and I've also      found that they eat better if their heads are higher than      their tails.</p><p> A second sleep box is always kept clean and      ready. Then each pig in turn is put in the diner, given its      bottle, cleaned, and transferred to the new box. This way,      none of the animals is slighted, and the first "dormitory"      can be immediately cleaned and made ready for the next      goround. (Once, when a litter managed to tip over the      sleeping box and get out, all eight of the little pigs      instantly rushed to the tub and stood on their hind feet,      hanging onto the only "mother" they knew in hopes of a      handout.)</p><p> Bottle feeding does make it more difficult to add      pellets to the babies' diet. Therefore, it's best to get      the group out of the house and into the orphanage as      quickly as possible, so you can begin to feed them from a      shallow, nonmetal tray or trough. (Sour grain and milk can      become toxic if served in metal containers, and could      slowly poison your pigs.) Put milk or suckle in the trough      and add a few pellets. At first the piglets will waste more      than they eat, and you might have to combine trough and      bottle feeding for a while. Gradually, though, you'll be      able to wean them from the bottle. While doing so, keep the      self-feeder full at all times, and always provide plenty of      fresh water.</p><p> Your most serious problems-when dealing      with orphaned litters-will likely be waste and dirt. Keep      both pigs and equipment clean, and never allow the food to      go sour . .. even if you have to dump some uneaten gruel on      the compost pile occasionally.</p><p> And remember that wherever      you house the pigs and no matter how many there are,      they'll need exercise. Prepare some "playground" space as      soon as the animals begin to eat solid food.			</p>			<h3>			SAFE AND SECURE			</h3>			<p>			One orphan is easy to care for indoors      for a couple of weeks without the bother of the box system      that I use for a whole litter. It's simpler, I've found,      just to keep the floor clean in a blockedoff area.      Furthermore, a single pig can be trained like a puppy . . .      by leaving a few thicknesses of newspaper in a specific      spot.</p><p> A lone infant will want a security blanket . . . pigs      like to cuddle and be wrapped up. Mine often make do with      an old coat. In fact, Ozzie-our little      Duroc-used to pack herself into her "blanket" sleeve      every night, looking like a sausage with two eyes and a      squeal.</p><p> You must also be sure to protect the tykes from      dogs . . . because even a usually gentle mutt will      sometimes go after the little strangers. And keep in mind      that a pig from a litter that's never been handled will be      a bit wild. It might be half-starved, but it can probably      still run like a deer and hide like a professional. Should      such a piglet get away, you may never catch it.</p><p> Finally,      don't be discouraged if you don't save every single runt or      orphan you adopt. After all, without your help none of them      would have survived. Mothering is always a bit of trouble,      but the rewards-in terms of inexpensive pork and      plain old self-satisfaction-are well worth the      effort.    </p>
