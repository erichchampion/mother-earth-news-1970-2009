                <p>      <strong>You can save money by turning some of your      farmstead labor over to a new kind of</strong>    </p>    		<hr />        <h3>		Joan R. Chapin    </h3>    <p>      Because pigs seem to produce more edible meat per      pound of feed than do other four-footed animals, we've      found that the critters represent a relatively secure and      profitable homestead investment. As an added advantage, the      porkers-if the need arises-can be butchered at      any age, without regard to their stage of growth and meat      preparedness.<br />      <br />      We became concerned, however, that our swine were able to      wallow idly during a good part of the year, while the grain      they consumed was costing us more by the month. In fact,      our frustration over rising feed costs inspired us to start      thumbing through back issues of MOTHER and scanning the      feed grain sections of seed catalogs . . . in search of      some moneysaving alternatives.    </p>    <h3>      PIGS IN THE PASTURE    </h3>    <p>      Our solution was developed (after a good bit of head      scratching) from ideas we found in Gary Nelson's article      "Pigs Plow My Garden!" (MOTHER NO. 35, page 20), which      suggests putting the animals' snouts to work as rototillers      . . . and in an R.H. Shumway Seeds men catalog (Dept. TMEN,      628 Cedar Street, Rockford, Illinois 61101), which listed      an "Annual Hog Pasture Mixture" (No. 1612) containing 11      different seed varieties (field peas, soybeans, hairy      vetch, clover, rape, sorghum, millet, turnips, barley,      oats, and rutabagas) that are ready for grazing in six      weeks.<br />      <br />      We concluded, therefore, that if we set aside some pasture      for pork, our pigs' grain consumption would be less for at      least six months of the year . . . and that as they ate,      the animals would automatically "till" the fields for      subsequent plantings. The idea became even more appealing      when we realized that pasturing pigs, whether young stock      or pregnant sows, makes excellent nutritional sense. It      seems that most green foods-especially      grasses-provide carotene, which is converted to      vitamin A and stored in the liver ... and shortages of this      vitamin may cause piglets to be stillborn or to die shortly      afterbirth. (Furthermore, if pigs receive only the bare      minimum requirement of vitamin A, they may still suffer a      retardation of growth: In a short time the pig's head      becomes too large in proportion to its body.)    </p>        <h3>      A MOVABLE PEN    </h3>    <p>      However, as we mulled over our brainstorm, a      different-and larger-problem began to take      shape. Our "Big Sally", you see, weighed at least 450      pounds . . . if the notion came upon her to head for a spot      where the grass appeared to be greener, she'd make short      work of the pasture fence. We had visions of her rooting up      small outbuildings at a single snort!<br />      <br />      No, lovable as they were, our grown pigs would need very      strong pens . . . and leave it to my semi retired-welder      husband to design enclosures made from steel! Once Paul sat      down with a drawing pad that snowy February evening, poor      Sal never had a roaming chance. He sketched and doodled and      finally worked up a plan for a 10-foot angle-iron enclosure      with steel wheels and a draw bar . .. in other words, a      movable hog pen.<br />      <br />      And, as we tossed his idea around, we quickly came up with      a number of fine reasons to build the rolling cage. It      would, of course, keep a pig secured so that such things as      parsnips, beehives, coops, and picket fences would stay      intact. The pen would also protect pregnant sows and at the      same time guarantee that the ground would be worked exactly      where we planned. In fact, the more we thought about the      concept, the better we liked it.<br />      <br />      Rolling hog enclosures, we figured, could accomplish the      spring plowing, in addition to turning up new ground while      leaving the stones on top. We could then renew the pasture      by moving the pen forward each day and sowing seeds      directly behind it .. . a practice which would permit the      pig to pasture in that same area within a few short weeks,      thanks to our fast-growing feed crops. (Remember, though,      that it's inadvisable to let pigs graze in the same field      for more than two years running, because some parasite      eggs-including Ascaris suis-are particularly      resistant to cold weather conditions and can accumulate,      causing an area to become what's known as "pig sick".)    </p>    <h3>      SCAVENGING FOR STEEL    </h3>    <p>      Once Paul had settled on a shape for the pen, he had to      locate a source of material. Some farms have antiquated      equipment left in the hedgerows, where trees grow up      through the iron while the woodwork rots and falls out. A      few of these relics are collector's items, and other pieces      are worth something simply for their weight as junk . . .      but the old hay-loaders from the days of loose hay don't      seem to hold much value for most folks, and we found that      the machines could easily be transformed into hog      carts.<br />      <br />      Actually, any strong and relatively lightweight material      (such as wood or pipe) can be used to construct a traveling      pigpen. We found that 8' X 10' is the optimum size for such      an enclosure, and an angle-iron "fence" around the bottom      of the assembly (set about 6 inches off the ground), with      its edge turned inward, helps discourage the pig from      rooting under and outside the barrier. A vertical sliding      door, which can be locked in either extreme position with a      pin, allows the pen to be brought up close to the barn for      easy loading and unloading. And be sure to provide a shade      at one end of the enclosure, and fasten water and feed pans      inside.    </p>    <h3>      TESTED AND APPROVED    </h3>    <p>      After using these pasturing devices for several years      (moving them, as necessary, two or three times a day),      we're sold on the idea. By planting our combination pasture      seed as early as possible-while the caged porkers are      still turning up our garden plot for us-we've cut our      feed bills and improved the health of our stock. As a      matter of fact, we've found that after their litters are      weaned, we need to feed our sows only half the grain that      was necessary in the past. The result is a very economical      livestock operation. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to      raise your own pigs for this purpose, turn to page      88.]<br />      <br /></em> Perhaps best of all, our animals' natural      rooting instincts are satisfied, while a good bit of what      used to be hard labor for us is accomplished without our      ever starting the gas-consuming tractor. Actually, it seems      that our pigs were ready and willing to work for us all      along ... we just hadn't given them the opportunity!    </p>
