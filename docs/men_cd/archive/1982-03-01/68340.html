                <p>      <em>An earth-sheltered house for about the price of a      mobile home? It's possible with . . .</em>THE $15,000 SOLAR      ARCADE STAFF PHOTOS    </p>    		<hr />                            <p>      In the past year or so, while most archi tects have been      struggling to develop plans for homes that could be erected      for less than half again their estimated cost, Angus Wyman      Macdonald has managed to pare building expense to the bone.      The latest brainchild of this Virginia architect (whose      no-frills approach to earth-sheltered construction was      introduced to MOTHER's readers in issue 67, page 174) is      the "Solar Arcade" . . . an 800square-foot, passive solar,      earth-bermed residence that can be completed at a cost      comparable to the purchase price of a trailer or a modular      house.<br />      <br />      In fact, Angus has borrowed the best of the techniques      usually applied to conventional prefabricated buildings and      incorporated them in the Arcade's construction. For      example, the designer-with the assistance of Virginia      engineer George Allman-has developed a precut, heavy timber      roof-framing kit . . . which can be secured to the home's      masonry shell by a drill-wielding do-it-yourselfer.<br />      <br />      Amazingly enough, the total cost of the Solar      Arcade-including the $2,500 framing kit, other materials,      and major labor -is $14,757 . . . or about $18 per square      foot for the one-bedroom home!    </p>    <h3>      A PREFAB EARTH SHELTER    </h3>    <p>      Two of MOTHER's staffers recently visIted the prototype      Solar Arcade-near Orange, Virginia-and found it a light and      airy dwelling snuggled into a south-facing hillside. Angus      is concerned with making his structures not only      functional, but affordable and easy to build as well . . .      following a concept he refers to as "anxietyfree,      energy-efficient housing". His investigation into, and      subsequent use of, modular techniques has grown out of his      work experience over the past few years.<br />      <br />      "I'm constantly amazed at the low cost of well-finished      modular housing, and also at the instant availability of      housetrailer accommodation," Macdonald says. He came to      that appreciation most strongly during his involvement with      the development of a lowcost housing project in Jamaica,      where Angus and a six- to eightman crew were able to erect      a panelized, three-bedroom dwelling-complete with      services-within seven days . . . fore total cost of      $6,000.<br />      <br />      This astounding accomplishment remained in the architect's      mind as he returned to his work in the States. Angus began      trying (successfully!) to meet his clients' demands for      comfortable, spacious living quarters without the burden of      huge mortgage payments (he estimates that eight of the      houses he's designed during the past year have been      completed for less than $40,000). As his work progressed,      Macdonald came to realize that he could combine the      energy-efficient attributes of earth-sheltered housing with      the labor- and cost-efficient benefits of prefabricated      construction ... and the earth-sheltered, passive solar      module was born.    </p>    <h3>      TAKING THE HEAT    </h3>    <p>      Angus decided that a south-facing, directgain passive solar      system would be the simplest and least expensive way of      heating his dwellings. The combination of concrete and      reinforced masonry acts as a heat sink, and the material's      mass is balanced against the size of the collector area      (which consists of sloping fiberglass installed above the      windows) to provide optimum performance throughout much of      North America. The roof angle permits maximum exposure of      the dark-colored interior rear wall in winter and less in      spring and fall . . . since an overhang and projecting fins      protect the glazing against summer sunlight (in fact, the      summer sun's rays will strike the collector area only in      early morning and late afternoon hours).<br />      <br />      "Through the basic geometry of the plan and the shape of      the dwelling, we've devised a house that responds to all      seasons . . . without requiring moving parts, complicated      machinery, or expensive and unusual building materials,"      Macdonald points out.<br />      <br />      Earth sheltering, of course, plays a large role in helping      the Solar Arcade maintain a stable year-round temperature.      And, in the part of Virginia where the model home is      located, summer cooling is just as important as is winter      heat.<br />      <br />      Happily, then, the flywheel effect of the earth's crust      works throughout the year upon the buried portions of the      walls and subgrade floors: The soil takes all summer to      warm up and all winter to cool down ... hence, subgrade      temperatures are remarkably stable throughout the seasons.      At Orange, Virginia's latitude, the ground temperature      fluctuates, on the average, only between 58° and      65°F.<br />      <br />      Angus has had a chance to evaluate his earth-sheltering      theories, too. The house that he designed for the Bresee      family, for example (it was featured in MOTHER NO. 67), has      maintained a nearly constant 70° interior temperature      through the winter . . . without the aid of a woodstove,      backup electric heat, or even the acrylic solar greenhouse      panels that the builder originally intended to install on      the south facfade. Likewise, the house has proved to be      comfortably cool during the summer.<br />      <br />      The Arcade is designed to incorporate a woodstove for      auxiliary warmth, but Angus recommends that homeowners who      face building code restrictions install electric baseboard      heat as a backup system ... since it's inexpensive,      satisfies the regulations, and lends itself well to      zoneheating. To facilitate the flow of warm air from room      to room, Macdonald has left openings, at ceiling level,      between the exposed beams. Furthermore, the home's      south-facing exposure all but begs for a solar domestic      water heater . . . and Angus's plans make provision for      such an installation.    </p>        <h3>      MODULAR MATERIALS    </h3>    <p>      To assemble a Solar Arcade, the builder first constructs      the masonry shell, and then frames the residence . . .      either using the precut timber kit or cutting the members      to specification. (The timber package, which can be shipped      to a do-it-yourselfer, is made up of oak beams with      mortise-andterion joints, for which pegs and a mallet are      provided. The builder will need to use a drill for      assembly, though, since the holes are bored after the      members are fitted together . . . to insure tight joints.      The kit costs $2,500, but a set of cutting diagrams and      execution drawings is available, for $50, to those who wish      to shape their own framing timbers.)<br />      <br />      After the masonry shell has been framed, the roof deck is      sheathed with plyform, a heavy oiled plywood chosen be      cause of its strength and water resistance. The roof and      walls are then covered with Griffolyn triple-layered      polyethylene. (Commonly used for truck tarpaulins, this      material is completely waterproof, extremely strong,      and-since a nylon fishnet is laminated between its      layerstearresistant.)<br />      <br />      Before the backfilling takes place, foundation drains are      installed . . . and, in wet regions, more drains are added      at roof level. Finally, a mixture of topsoil and peat moss      is layered over the fill earth.    </p>    <h3>      A ROCK-BOTTOM COST    </h3>    <p>      The Solar Arcade's $14,757 price tag can be broken down      into $10,627 for materials and $4,130 for labor. (Angus      points out that folks who live in urban areas will likely      have lower materials expenses, which will probably be      offset by somewhat higher labor costs.) Of course, if a      person can do his or her own masonry and/or can cut the      framing timbers from the diagrams-in addition to finish      carpentry and the like-the total building expense could be      significantly lower.<br />      <br />      The basic Arcade is somewhat Spartan in appearance, leaving      the owner considerable leeway in finishing off the home's      interior. Macdonald's intention is to construct a livable      earth-sheltered house at a reasonable cost . . . therefore,      a large portion of the building budget is spent on      high-quality, durable components-such as well-made doors      and Andersen windowsrather than on "decoration".<br />      <br />      Angus believes that a builder, particularly a first-time      homeowner who's likely stretching his or her financial      resources to the breaking point, will prefer to add ceramic      tile, custom cabinetry, or other appointments later . . .      as money becomes available. And the dollars should be there      for the spending in a relatively short time, since mortgage      payments and utility bills will have been kept to a minimum      from the outset.<br />      <br />      There's an additional financial benefit for a would-be      Arcade builder, too: Because of its heavy timber frame and      masonry construction, the home has been rated as      practically fireproof by a Virginia insurance agency, and      premiums to insure the dwelling "against all perils" amount      to less than $100 a year.<br />      <br />      Plans for the Solar Arcade-which include working drawings,      a cost analysis, and a specification booklet-are priced at      $100 a set. They may be ordered from Survival Consultants,      Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 21, Rapidan, Virginia 22733. (Angus      also encloses a suppliers list ... which contains a      description of-and access information forthe specific      materials he recommends for waterproofing, structure, and      finishing.) Plans for a modified twobedroom version of the      Solar Arcade are available, too .. . and any inquiries      about the precut heavy timber kit or the cutting diagrams      should be directed to the same address.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Survival Consultants offers a</em>      <em>catalog of all the organization's standard home plans      for $5.00. . . and precut framing kits, similar to the one      de- . signed for the Solar Arcade, are available for some      of the other houses as well.<br />      <br /></em> <em>Angus Macdonald will also work with clients      in helping modify his standard plans, and in providing      custom design work.</em>    </p>
