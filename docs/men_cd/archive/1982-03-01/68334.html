Donovan    </h5>                                                    <p>      Honey-tree hunting is an age-old craft that-quite      simply-involves following wild honeybees (Apis      mellifera) to their colonies . . . which are usually found      in hollow trees. Besides providing you with a fine excuse      to spend some time in the outdoors, such a search      can-if successful-yield gallons and gallons of      free, natural sweetener and can even give you a chance to      capture a hive of bees for your own backyard apiary. You      don't necessarily have to live deep in the back country to      hunt up a honey tree, either, because wild bee colonies can      be found in suburbs and cities . . . as well as in rural      areas in every part of the United States, Mexico, and      southern Canada.    </p>    <p>      The early spring months, when the first major honey flow of      the year begins, provide good opportunities to track bees,      since the insects are still "winter hungry" and can easily      be lured by s cents. The hunting season lasts as long as the      insects are still flying, however ... which is a period of      about six months over most of the country, and even longer      in southern climes.    </p>    <h3>      BAIT THE BEE    </h3>    <p>      The bee hunter has to discover the trail to a honey tree by      observing a foraging worker bee . . . because when the      industrious female has collected a full load of nectar,      she'll head straight for home. The fundamental tactic,      then, is to note the direction in which the pollen-packing      lady flies and, by making a series of such observations,      eventually determine the location of the bees' home. It      sounds easy when it's put that way, but-as you've      probably guessed-there are a good many subtleties to      the craft.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, a bee may visit several hundred flowers      before heading back to the colony, and keeping track of her      during that round of activity would be both difficult and      time consuming. The best way to solve this problem is to      provide your own source of "nectar" . . . a 50/50 mix (by      volume) of water and ordinary sugar.    </p>    <p>      Given such easy pickings, the honeymakers will fill up at      your nectar station and then head straight back to their      tree . . . and they'll keep returning for more, too!      However, before you lure bees to your sweet bait, you      should be sure you're operating in an area well away (at      least two miles) from any known beekeepers, or the      nectar-laden insects may simply lead you to a domestic      hive.    </p>    <p>      Try to start your hunt in an open space where the bees are      already foraging (it's difficult to establish flight      direction in a dense forest of mature trees). Once you've      chosen a good spot, set out a shallow dish of sugar water      with wood chips floating in it for the bees to land on.      When a worker locates the food, she'll return to the colony      and tell the others of her find by performing a dance      pattern that gives them explicit directions to the bonanza.      Soon hundreds of bees will swarm around your offering,      flying back and forth between the dish and their home.    </p>    <p>      It may, of course, take the insects a while to discover the      bait, particularly if only a few are working your area. If      that proves to be the case, you can announce your offering      by the use of such s cents as anise, sweet clover, or      bergamot . . . which you might be able to purchase in your      drugstore. (Anise oil-for one-has a very strong      aroma, though, so it's best to dilute your supply by mixing      together two ounces of alcohol, two ounces of water, and      one dram of anise oil and shaking them vigorously.) Don't,      however, add the s cents to the nectar itself, as they might      be harmful to any bees that eat them. Instead, put a few      drops on a handkerchief, or on a twig full of leaves, which      you can wave about in the air and then place near the      sugar-water supply to attract your prey. (Plastic      "backpacking" bottles with attached caps are ideal for      carrying both bait and scent.)    </p>    <p>      A quick method of collecting bees involves the use of a      bait box. Traditionally, these are flat and look much like      cigar boxes, but I've developed a vertical      design-shaped more like a milk carton-that I      think is easier to use (especially when bees are working      such low-lying plants as white clover and dandelions).    </p>    <p>      The box can be made of almost any kind of scrap wood that      you might have around, although I favor 3/8" plywood. Its      outside dimensions are roughly 4" X 4" X 9", and there are      two inside compartments. The lower chamber is approximately      6" high, and is connected to the upper room by a 3/8"-wide      slit. The bee trap is left open on the bottom, and its      upper side is fitted with a glass- or plastic-covered exit,      which allows light to enter and attract the bees into the      top section. (See the accompanying black-and-white cutaway      photo for construction details.)    </p>    <p>      After the bee-catcher has been assembled, paint the outside      white to make it more visible to returnees, but don't coat      the interior, since the insects seem to prefer the texture      and smell of unfinished wood.    </p>    <p>      When you're ready to hunt down some winged foragers, put a      piece of honeycomb (buy it from an apiary supply company or      a beekeeper) sprinkled with sugar water in the upper      chamber, and cover the top opening with a piece of clear      glass or plastic held in place with a rubber band. Then      find some bees that are working low-lying flowers . . .      place the bait box over a blossom with a bee in it . . .      and press the container against the ground, trapping the      bee in the lower chamber. Allow about 15 seconds for the      insect to be lured to the light coming from the upper      chamber, then pick up the box and trap another bee. Once      you have 10 or 20 workers in the box's second story, cover      the "window" with some opaque material and let your trap      sit for five minutes . . . to give the bees time to settle      down and start feeding. That done, remove both covers from      the upper section and allow one (or several) of your      well-fed captives to emerge.    </p>    <h3>      ESTABLISH THE BEELINE    </h3>    <p>      Whether you're using a bait box or a sugar-water dish,      carefully watch the flight of each bee as she leaves.      She'll first lift off and fly in circles around the bait,      in order to get her bearings and to fix the location of the      free feast in her mind. As she flies, the circles will get      bigger and bigger, and then-zing!-she'll be      gone. It's easy to lose sight of your quarry at that point,      so make a mental note of the direction of each bee's      departure, relative to some landmark (perhaps a tree or a      building). After observing several such paths, you can      determine an average heading . . . which is your beeline.    </p>    <p>      Because the outgoing insects always circle before      departing, it's sometimes easier to establish the general      direction of the colony by moving a few yards away from the      bait, where you can keep an eye on arriving foragers.      They'll be coming in a straight line from their home until      they get very near the bait . . . at which point they, too,      will begin to circle.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, after studying a number of comings and goings,      you'll determine your beeline, and the honey tree should be      somewhere along that line . . . but you'll still have to      figure out just where. One way to do so is to relocate your      lure several hundred yards down the beeline toward the      colony. There, reestablish the direction-again using      either your sugar-water dish or a bait box-to get a      fix from a point closer to your target. (The best time to      relocate is when you have some 10 to 20 bees working the      bait. When using a box, trap the remaining bees inside by      covering the bottom during the move.)    </p>    <p>      If the feeders don't return to your bait within 20 minutes,      they probably aren't going to, perhaps because you've gone      past the bee tree. Should you get no action, then, just go      back to the previous location . . . catch another load of      bees . . . and, this time, move only half as far along the      beeline-before trying again-as you previously      did.    </p>    <p>      Another way to go about locating the colony is to mark a      bee, using a piece of chalk and a small artist's brush.      Just wait until the insects are busily working the bait,      then scrape a little chalk dust loose . . . moisten it with      saliva . . . dip in the paint brush . . . select a bee that      appears to be particularly engrossed in the sugar water . .      . and give her a swipe or two across the top of her      abdomen. Then note the time of your target's departure and      return, and figure that it takes about 5.2 minutes-on      the average-for a bee to fly one-quarter mile.    </p>    <h3>      BEFORE THE STRIKE    </h3>    <p>      Timing flights and establishing bee lines will still give      you only the approximate location of a colony, but the      final search for the tree itself can be speeded up if you      keep the following facts in mind: Wild bees tend to make      their homes in the rotted-out centers of living trees that      (normally) range from 18" to 60" in diameter. The preferred      tree type is highly variable and will depend largely on      where you live. In the South and Southwest, black gum trees      and live oaks are popular nesting places. Farther north      you'll find that oaks, poplars, and maples are the most      common choices for bee dwellings.    </p>    <p>      Once the insects' home base is identified, most folks      remove the honey by cutting the tree down. That means, of      course, that-unless it's on your land-you'll      have to get permission from the owner . . . maybe offering      a share of the honey and/or firewood in exchange. (In very      big trees, the colony may inhabit only a hollow limb that      can be cut off, leaving the rest of the woodland giant      intact . . . but before doing so, make sure that the branch      isn't being used merely as an entryway into the trunk.)    </p>    <p>      Don't start chopping, though, until you're sure the area      has plenty of other old, large, dead or dying trees that      can be used for nests and dens by birds, animals, and bees.      The natural processes that create a usable hollow tree are      mighty slow compared to the workings of a chain saw! If      there are no substitute wildlife homes in the area-or      if the bees have taken up residence in a rock      formation-it's better to use a nondestructive method.    </p>    <p>      One such technique involves coaxing the bees to take up      residence in a "real" hive, then inducing them to rob their      old home of its honey so that you can take your share. This      rather involved procedure is detailed in my book Hunting      Wild Bees (available for $11.95 plus $1.10 shipping and      handling from Winchester Press, Inc., Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box      1260, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101).    </p>    <p>      If you do encounter a situation where you can cut down the      tree to lay larcenous hands on the bees' precious,      hard-earned golden treasure (and/or capture the bees),      remember that these relatively mild-mahnered little      creatures can be transformed into raging demons . . . so,      before you begin any such operation, cover up! Bees can      sting right through slacks, so put on two pairs (made of      sturdy material) and tie them snug at the bottom.    </p>    <p>      You should also wear several shirts, a pair of gloves that      cover the wrists, and a head net. Commercially made "bee      bonnets" can be purchased at apiary supply houses, but I've      gotten by with a turkey hunter's camouflage head net. Care      must be taken, however, that the veil doesn't come in      contact with the face, because bees have an uncanny way of      finding such places. Make sure, too, that your headgear is      sealed around the neck. Finally, it's wise to avoid dark      fabrics (including denim) and clothing made of animal      fibers such as wool or felt . . . these materials seem to      incite bees to attack.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you'll need something to put your honey in, too.      I've found that lightweight plastic buckets are good for      this purpose, since they can be stacked one inside the      other when empty and are easy to carry. The amount of      container capacity required will depend on how lucky a find      you make. A bee tree can contain anywhere from no honey to      (on rare occasions) 15 to 20 gallons. Be sure you take      along a large metal spoon to dip up any honey from combs      that may be broken by the tree's fall, and a large, soft      brush to whisk away the bees from slabs of honeycomb.    </p>    <h3>      BEE TREE BURGLARY    </h3>        <p>      Before you tackle the task of felling the tree, calm the      bees down by smoking them. (Smokers can be bought from bee      supply houses, or-perhaps-borrowed from a      neighbor who keeps hives.) If the colony is too high up to      accomplish this easily, the smoking should be done as soon      as the tree is on the ground.    </p>    <p>      It's preferable to fell the bees' habitat with a chain saw      rather than an axe if you have a choice. Smoked bees will      often remain surprisingly calm when a saw is used, while      the repeated thumps of an axe usually excite them. Whatever      method you employ, try to drop the tree as gently as      possible-letting its own branches, other trees,      and/or an uphill slope break the fall-since a jolting      crash will smash the honeycomb, kill bees unnecessarily,      and create a general mess.    </p>    <p>      If you're not planning to capture the insects, the easiest      way of removing the honey is to split a rectangular slab      out of the side of the fallen tree, using an axe or chain      saw and wedges. But first try to figure out the extent of      the cavity. This can be done fairly accurately by looking      up the bottom of the felled tree, peering through any holes      and splits, and tapping on the trunk. (Make the very best      estimate possible, or you and your tools could end up      covered with honey.)    </p>    <p>      The slab that has to be removed will probably be 36" to 60"      long and 10" to 18" wide, depending on how much of the      hollow is suspected of being inhabited. Make the top and      bottom cuts first, then connect them with longer cuts      running lengthwise down the trunk. Since the second pair      will pass close to the mass of bees and honeycomb, every      effort should be made to keep the blade out of the cavity.      It's better to err on the shallow side than to cause      needless bee and brood deaths and loss of honey by slicing      too deep, especially since wedges can always be used to      help pry a slab free.    </p>    <p>      Once the interior of the colony is exposed, lift the sheets      of honeycomb and put them in your containers. (Keep the      filled pails covered, or they'll soon be alive with bees.)    </p>    <p>      From the time the spring honey flow is fully off and      running until midsummer, you can safely remove most of the      bees' store of honey, since they'll still have time to      replenish the supply before winter. However, in late summer      or early fall, at least 40 pounds (in mild climates) and 80      pounds (in areas with harsh winters) should be left inside      the tree to insure the colony's survival during the cold      nectarless months. Also, leave any brood comb (the cells      that contain larvae) in the tree, and the queen bee if you      find her. (Should you inadvertently remove the queen,      however, the colony will raise a new one. . . provided      you've left some young brood.)    </p>    <p>      Now, replace the slab and tie or nail it into place,      plugging up any holes with boards, pieces of bark, or      stones to keep out the rain. In other words, do your best      to help the colony survive, and you'll have your very own      natural apiary that can be visited once or twice a year for      honey extraction. (All you'll have to do then is remove the      previously cut slab . . . help yourself to some honey . . .      and put the cover in place again!)    </p>    <h3>      BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME    </h3>    <p>      Should you decide to take the insects home for your apiary,      cut the fallen tree up into sections (they're called "bee      gums"), each 18" to 30" long. Then give the bees an hour or      so to calm down and return to the various gums. Once that's      happened, staple some fly screen over both ends of each      section, and you'll have portable logs with all the honey      and most of the bees sealed inside. Take care, though, to      transport the gums as gently as possible . . . to avoid      damaging the comb.    </p>    <p>      Once the pieces are safely back home, you can transfer the      bees to a commercial hive from which the inner and outer      covers have been removed. To do so, take the screen off      each tree section and split the log in half, exposing the      comb inside. Lift out the pieces of comb, one at a time,      and brush the bees into their new home. Then separate the      comb into honeycomb (for you) and brood comb (for the      bees). Be very careful not to injure the queen when you      move her. Once she accepts her change of address, many of      the worker bees will tend to stay put. Secure the brood      comb in the four center frames of your hive, using elastic      bands. Then replace the covers and leave the bees alone. By      nightfall, most of them will have moved into their new      residence.    </p>    <p>      To extract the honey from the comb you've kept for      yourself, place a fine strainer over a large bowl . . .      break off pieces of honeycomb . . . and crush them with      your hands. Drop these wadded-up balls into the strainer      and allow them to drain. The result of this delightfully      gooey exercise will be a bowl full of natural honey and a      strainer full of sticky beeswax. You can purify the latter      material by dropping the balls of crushed honeycomb into a      pot of boiling water, causing the wax to melt and float to      the top. At that point, set the pot aside. As the beeswax      cools, it will harden on the water's surface and can be      easily removed . . . to be sold or made into candles.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you decide you want to become serious      about bee hunting, we recommend-in addition to      reading the author's excellent book on this      subject-that you review "Beekeeping Basics" in MOTHER      NO. 67, page 78.
