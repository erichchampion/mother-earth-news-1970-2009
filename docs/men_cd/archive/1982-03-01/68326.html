                <p>      <em>Most people know the value of milk, but not many know      that it can be used to prepare . . .</em><strong>PHOTOS BY THE      AUTHOR</strong>    </p>    		<hr />    		 <h3>		 D. J. Young		 </h3>		 <p>		  Spraying your plants with milk      won't drive bugs away from your garden, but the dairy      product can be used to culture Bacillus thuriugiensis      Berliner, a well-known bacterial pesticide sold under such      brand names as Dipel, Thuricide, and Biotrol. The agent is      quite effective in controlling-among a number of      insect problems-infestations of loopers . . . those      pesky little worms (they're actually moth larvae) that      attack broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and other members of      the cole family. Once eaten, the bacteria paralyze the      larvae's intestinal tracts and bring about their death in      two to four days.</p><p> Before you spray your garden with      <em>thuringiensis</em> , though, be aware that this      bacterial-warfare weapon is fatal to the caterpillars of      all Lepidoptera (an order of insects that includes many      lovely, and relatively harmless, moths and butterflies) . .      . so please don't employ the remedy in cases where simply      handpicking the loopers off your plants will do the job.      (That rule, of course, applies to the use of any pesticide,      natural or otherwise!)			</p>			<h3>			THE MILK MEDIUM			</h3>			<p>      However, if the little green caterpillars get completely      out of control, you can go to the store and buy some      commercially prepared Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) . . . and      use the product, in conjunction with the pests themselves,      to brew your own supply from that point on! The basic      procedure for doing so was mologist at Louisiana State      University's Cooperative Extension Service in Baton Rouge.      Dr. Pollet decided that since milk is a good medium for      bacterial culture ( a fact that not only causes the      liquid-especially when unrefrigerated-to spoil,      but allows us to harvest such by-products as cheese,      yogurt, and kefir), and since Dipel, Thuricide, and Biotrol      are all bacterial pesticides . . . it should be possible to      use milk to extend the bacteria's useful lives.</p><p> According      to a report on Dr. Pollet's work, the process goes like      this: The pesticide is sprayed on the plants, where it's      eaten by the loopers. Then the tiny parasites develop      inside the caterpillars' bodies and kill their hosts. When      the infected larvae are gathered before the bacteria in      them die, and are blended into milk (an effective culture      for the microorganisms), the bacteria strain will stay      alive and can be used again to kill other loopers.      </p>			<h3>			A PERSONAL EXPERIMENT			</h3>			<p>			After reading this report, I decided to conduct my own experiment: I wanted to      see for myself whether the system would work. (Besides, I      always jump at any chance to save money, and commercial      bacterial pesticides are expensive!)</p><p> All the project      involved was gathering a palmful of infected loopers from a      section of my cabbage patch that had been treated with some      store-bought BT . . . mashing and blending them into one      pint of warm milk (I thought a lukewarm environment would      promote bacterial reproduction... then letting the looper      or milk mixture stand for three day, sure the caterpillars      you start with are still fresh. Once the larvae are dried      up chances are the bacilli will no longer be active.) Next,      I strained the brew through cheesecloth, diluted it with      water to make a gallon of liquid sprayed the concoction on      some looper-infested broccoli plants.</p><p> Two days later, it      was evident that the larvae were no longer eating. By the      next day they were becoming discolored, and soon thereafter      they were very dead. My experiment was a success!      </p>			<h3>			THE NEXT STEP			</h3>			<p>			 Having once used loopers      infected with bacteria from a commercial source to make a      new batch of pesticide, I wondered whether I could continue      the chain by using pests that had been sprayed with my      homebrew (much as a starter from each batch of yogurt can      be used to make additional yogurt). So I gathered a dozen      loopers from the brocolli, treated with my pesticidal milk      shake processed them in the same manner sprayed a second      infested patch. This third generation mixture proved to be      just as effective as the first and second applications had      been.    </p>    <p>      And just how many times could the process be repeated?      Well, I really know, but it's reasonable to expect that as      long as the      Bacillus thurangiensis Berliner can be kept alive-and      milk to provide a ready means of doing that-the      bacteria will live to serve you again . . . and again . . .    </p>

It's necessary to apply the spray to the underside of the leaves where the pests are feeding. . . . This is how a healthy looper looks . . . . This one, showing the effects of the pesticide, can be used to brew a new batch of Bacillus thuringiensis. . . . One pint of the milk mixture will yield one gallon of spray solution.
