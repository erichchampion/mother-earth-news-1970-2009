                <p>      <strong>When we Brighten your family breakfast with a dish      developed at one of the world's most successful New Age      communities . . .</strong>    </p>    		<hr />    <p>      when we visited Scotland's Findhorn Foundation last year to      research an article on that community (see "Findhorn: A      Bright Light in a Dark World", MOTHER NO. 71, page 32), we      were impressed with the bountiful, delicious, and elegant      vegetarian meals served there . . . so we picked up a copy      of <em>The Findhorn Family Cookbook</em> by Kay Lynne Sherman      (Findhorn Publication, 1981, $7.95).    </p>    <p>      It wasn't easy to select just one sample from the      mouthwatering choices . . . but we think the following dish      would be a nice N ay to start any day.<br />      <br />      First, while the oven preheats to 350Â°F, grease a      baking dish . . . wash 4 large tomatoes . . . cut out their      stems and middle sections . . . place them in the dish . .      . and salt and pepper them. Now, grate 1/4 cup of Swiss      cheese and divide half of it among the scooped-out      tomatoes, along with a teaspoon of butter apiece. Next,      break an egg into each hollow . . . salt the eggs . . .      sprinkle on the remaining cheese . . . top off your      creations with a bit of chopped parsley . . . and bake them      for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the eggs are set.<br />      <br />      Finally, in the wonderful Findhorn tradition, serve the      breakfast with love.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Participants</em> <em>in our Visit to      Findhorn and Friends tour this coming May (see page 66)      will not only enjoy such delightful dishes, but likely      learn how to prepare some of them. As well. The Hydra Book      Company (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 813, Forest Grove, Oregon      97116) will mail you a list of all Find- books and tapes if      you'll send o large self-addressed, stamped envelops with      your request.</em>    </p>
