                <p>      <em>Spring is on its way . . . and many a gardener's fancy      turns to thoughts of good eating!</em>    </p>        <hr />        <h3>      Linda Slater    </h3>    <p>      Asparagus(Asparagus officinalis) has always been one of my      favorite vegetables, but until I started cultivating it      myself, I had no idea how delicious the tender spears could      be. Garden-grown (just picked or home-frozen) asparagus      provides an experience in taste that just can't be matched      by canned or even store-bought fresh produce. And the tasty      plant is nutritious, too. As was pointed out in MOTHER NO.      60 (page 112), 100 grams of asparagus will supply 2.2 grams      of protein, 900 units of vitamin A, and only 0.2 grams of      fat . . . while adding a mere 20 calories to your daily      total.    </p>    <p>      Asparagus has been cultivated since the days of the Roman      Republic, when it was considered a delicacy. Later, the      French grew the stalks in primitive hotbeds, and honored      them in still-life paintings. Eventually, asparagus was      brought to America and became popular both as a vegetable      and, you may be surprised to learn, as a medicinal herb (it      was believed to be a cure for jaundice).<br />      <br />      There are a number of popular commercial strains of      asparagus available, the most common of which are the      Washington varieties. The Mary Washington, which I grow, is      both prolific and hardy in my part of Montana. And it would      probably grow even better in a somewhat less severe      climate, although it does require a dormant period during      winter months and thus flourishes only when dormancy is      induced . . . either naturally-by cold      weather-or artificially.<br />      <br />      I set out my Mary Washington roots in April . . . choosing      a spot where they'd get several hours of sun daily and      where I was pretty sure they wouldn't be disturbed by      another project in the future, since I wanted to get a      lifetime of picking from the bed. For my first planting, I      dug a 12-foot trench, eight inches deep, and spread 20      pounds of ground limestone and 10 pounds of phosphate rock      in the bottom of the ditch . . . followed by a five-inch      layer of compost and manure. Two inches of rich loam went      on top of that. Next-after giving the plot a heavy      watering-I planted a dozen clusters of roots, spacing      them about a foot apart . . . and then, each time I weeded      during the next few weeks, added fine compost and good soil      until the trench was filled.<br />      <br />      As you may already know, asparagus shouldn't be picked      during its first year . . . but the rewards of owning an      established bed make the waiting worthwhile. I mulched my      asparagus well that first fall, with compost and still more      ma nure. Then, the following spring, I watered the bed      heavily, spread additional compost, and hand-plucked the      early weeds that had cropped up. (Some people let geese      take care of the weeding, but-if the idea appeals to      you-make sure the honkers are in their pen when the      first green asparagus tips show themselves!)<br />      <br />      In Montana, the first spears begin to appear in late May or      early June. Let the shoots develop to about six inches      before you pick any . . . and, after that, keep a close eye      on the bed in order to garner the stalks before they go to      seed. During that initial harvest season, it's best to      exercise a little self-discipline: Allow yourself only two      weeks of feasting, and then let the rest of the plants      mature. The second time around-and in subsequent      years-they can be gathered over a sixweek      season.<br />      <br />      Generally, an established plot will require little      attention. It may occasionally face minor insect problems,      but the worst threat to your plants will likely be a      disease called asparagus rust. The Mary Washington strain      is fairly resistant to this ailment, although it will      sometimes be attacked if it's grown in areas that are      frequently damp. (For this reason, as well as because the      region has insufficient cold weather, asparagus doesn't      often do well in southern Florida or along the Gulf Coast.)    </p>    <h3>      THE VERSATILE VEGETABLE    </h3>    <p>      Asparagus is sweetest when freshly cut. Within hours after      picking, its sugars (like those of sweet corn) begin      turning to starch, and the vegetable acquires the slightly      bitter taste typical of most grocery store spears. Be sure,      then, that you're ready to use or process your pickings      immediately.<br />      <br />      Believe it or not, garden-fresh asparagus is even delicious      raw. You can munch on it while you're doing your outdoor      chores, cut it up in a salad, or serve it as an appetizer      with sour cream or avocado dip.<br />      <br />      To cook your crop, wash the spearse-specially the      tips-to remove any clinging dirt. Tie a bunch loosely      together and place them upright in a deep, narrow pan (an      old coffeepot is often just the right size and shape) with      sufficient boiling water to cover the (tougher) bottom ends      of the stalks but not the tender tops. When the pot returns      to the boil, put a lid on it (to retain the steam) and cook      the stalks until they're tender . . . which should be after      about 10 minutes. Salt and pepper the spears to taste, and,      serve them with butter and a lemon wede . . . or dress them      up with cheese, hollan daise, or bearnaise sauce . . .      almonds . . . or heated Italian dressing. For variety, you      might occasionally want to add ginger, or a soupcon of      crushed garlic, as seasoning.<br />      <br />      Asparagus can, of course, be incorporated into many soups,      casseroles, and breads. Here are just two special dishes      that my family likes.    </p>    <h3>      CRUNCHY ASPARAGUS    </h3>    <p>      1 tablespoon of salad oil<br /> 3 cups of fresh asparagus cut in      inch-long sections<br /> salt and pepper</p><p> Heat the oil in the      skillet, and-when it's quite hot-add the asparagus      and seasonings. Cover the pan and hold it just slightly      above a burner set on "high", shaking it constantly. After      about 4 minutes, the morsels will have a wonderful      crisp-tender texture.    </p>    <h3>      ASPARAGUS IN WINE    </h3>    <p>      2 pounds of washed spears<br /> 1/4 cup of white wine<br /> 1/4 cup of      melted butter</p><p> 1/2 teaspoon of salt<br /> 1/4 teaspoon of pepper<br />      1/3 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</p><p> Dunk the asparagus in      boiling water, cover it, reduce the heat, and allow the pot      to simmer for just 8 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the wine into      the melted butter. When the time's up, drain the vegetables      (save the liquid for soup makings), pour on the sauce, add      the salt and pepper, and sprinkle the cheese on top. Bake      the dish, uncovered, in a 425°F oven for 15 minutes.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT TO DO WITH THE SURPLUS    </h3>    <p>      Once your bed is in full production, it's just possible      that your daily haul of tender spears will be more than you      want to consume right away. And, in my opinion, freezing is      about the best way to preserve asparagus, since its texture      and taste are better retained in that process than they are      in canning.<br />      <br />      Here's the method I use-every day, in season-to      store my extras for good eating the following winter. [1]      Clean the young spears and use string to tie them in      meal-sized bundles. [2] Bring a large pot of water to      boiling and add the asparagus. [3] Blanch it for 3 minutes      (begin timing only after the water returns to a full      rolling boil). [4] Lift the bundles out of the pot and      plunge them into ice water. [5] Once the stalks are      completely cooled, pack them-airtight-in      plastic bags or other containers. [6] Label and date the      packages, and pop them into the freezer.<br />      <br />      As an alternative, you can dry asparagus, if you use only      the tender tips. First, wash them thoroughly, and then      steam them for 2 minutes. Spread the blanched tops, on      trays, in a dehydrator or a 140°F oven for 3 to 5 hours      . . . or dry them in full sun-when the temperature is      98 to 100°F-for 8 to 10 hours. Don't skimp on the      time . . . the stalks aren't "done" till they're either      leathery or brittle.<br />      <br />      When reconstituted, dried asparagus has a soft      texture-much like that of the canned      product-and a brownish color. It's best used in a      finely ground form, added to broths, sauces, or casseroles.    </p>    <h3>      FOR STARTERS    </h3>    <p>      If I've convinced you to put in your own asparagus bed,      it's time to place your order. I purchased my Mary      Washington roots from a local nursery, but just in case      your nearest garden emporium doesn't carry them, here are      some mail order sources for both roots and seeds (one      packet of seeds will sow a 20-foot row . . . but roots, of      course, produce a harvest sooner).<br />      <br />      Burpee Seed Company, Dept. TMEN, Warminster, Pennsylvania      18991 . . . or Clinton, Iowa 52732 . . . or Riverside,      California 92502 (one-year roots).</p><p> Jackson & Perkins,      Dept. TMEN, Medford, Oregon 97501 (two-year roots).<br />      <br />      Earl May Seeds & Nursery Company, Dept. TMEN, North Elm      Street, Shenandoah,<br />      <br />      Iowa 51603. R.H. Shumway, Dept. TMEN, 628 Cedar Street,      Rockford, Illinois 61101.    </p>
