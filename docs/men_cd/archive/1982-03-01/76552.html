        <p><em><strong>"Good judgment comes from experience . . . experience comes from bad judgment."</strong></em></p><p>Well sir, to my mind March is about the nastiest month of the year. Not only does it smack you with sneak-up spats of cold an' snow, but thet foul weather hits when most folks are plumb out of firewood. In point of fact, jist the other day a number of the members of the Plumtree Crossin' Truth an' Veracity League was sittin' around the potbellied stove in Sylvester Pennywhistle's Gen'ral Store, lamentin' their empty woodsheds (without, o'course, doin' a cussed thing to remedy the situation) . . . when young Billy Parsons up an' says, "Gee, wouldn't it be neat if someone built a machine thet'd do all your wood choppin' for you?"</p><p>Ott Bartlett, one of the senior liars of the group (thet feller claims he were old when New Orleans was a blueprint), replied, "Don't you know, son, thet of Purvis Jacobs never lifts a finger bringin' in fuel . . . 'cause he has jist sich a device?"</p><p>Then Newt Blanchard, thet other long-lived prevaricator, chipped in, "Thet danged doodad don't jist split wood, neither. It knocks down the tree, chops it, an' stacks it nice an' neat!"</p><p>"Aw, come on," young Billy said, "ain't nothin' kin do thet . . . uh . . . what's it called?"</p><p>"Why, the Mechanical Arbivore &reg , o'course," Ott answered. "Ain't you nev'r heered a loud wail-kinda like what a wildcat with ingrowed claws might make-comin' outa Purvis's place? Thet's the toothpick-maker gittin' started."</p><p>Jist then the piercin' sound of a shrill, distant whistle reached the ears of the store's seated assembly. "There," Newt said, "it's a-crankin' up now. Hear how it only give one toot? Thet means the Mechanical Arbivore° is about to do some sawin' on another doomed tree."</p><p>As Newt spoke, he, Ott, Lem Tucker, Skeeter Ridges, Clarence Smithers, an' Lafe Higgins all started buttonin' up their coats . . . an'-each mumblin' somethin' about his own woodpile-the of reprobates headed out the door.</p><p>It were about a week later, when Purvis Jacobs was fist gittin' up from settin' on his front porch (it bein' the tail end of a briefly warm March day thet looked to freeze up with a vengeance come nightfall), thet a lanky feller-all loaded down with pencils, cameras, pads, an' portyble tape recorders-drove up. Out he hops, hands over a business card ("Arthur D. Scribe, Roving Reporter, Republican Courier, Erosion Junction's Weekly Newspaper . . . If It Comes In Near Deadline, Fills A Hole, And Don't Cost Us Nothing, We'll Print It"), gives Purvis one of them nonstop pump-handle handshakes, an' says in a voice faster'n failin' on ice:</p><p>"PleasedtomeetyaPurvisJacobsI'mcometocoveryerMechanicalArbivore &reg f erth' <em>Courier</em> mylittlecousinBillyParsons toldmeaboutitan'Ifiggerit'sgottabemoreint'restin'than thelambin'san'stucktractorsan'taxagentsI'veseenso farthisweekwhereisit?"</p><p>Well, Purvis set back down a minute (whilst he pulled thet man's words far enough apart in his mind to compryhend 'em) afore steppin' inside to grab a bright red demijohn labeled-in white-with the words CAUTION: EXTREEMLY FLAMMYBLE. Then he led Arthur Scribe a couple hundred feet away from the house to where two recently felled an' sawed up locust trees lay in the woods. Right next to them rounds was a pile of iron scrap bits an' ends . . . what looked fer all the world like someone had taken a broke crosscut saw, a used crankshaft, a misshapen train whistle, a cracked axe head, a junked gasoline lawn mower, an' a whole assortment of levers, pulleys, gears, an' brake shoes . . . dropped 'em-all at once't-off a three-story buildin' . . . an' then jist welded the pieces together the way they landed.</p><p>"There she is," Purvis said. "I'll start 'er, but it takes an hour er so to warm up in cold weather, so I don't 'spect you'll git to see it do much."</p><p>Mister Scribe took photographs, from jist about every side but the underside of the Arbivore &reg , while Purvis got to work. First he took a big swig from the red jug to test the fuel ("this here Arbivore° is alkyhol-powered, y'understand"). Then he inverted the jug over the lawnmower engine's small fuel tank to pervide continuous refill, cranked the contraption up, give two howls on the whistle ("those two toots tell it to split wood, y'see"), an' turned to walk back to his house.</p><p>"Waitaminute! " yipped Scribe as he hurried after Jacobs. "Ihaven'tfoundoutev'rythingIwanttoknow ! "</p><p>Well, thet night turned out to be a mighty chilly one, an' fer Purvis Jacobs-tryin' to answer the triple-speed queries of Arthur D. Scribe-it were a long one, to boot. By sunrise, the reporter had only jilt run out of questions, an' Purvis took him back out to the Mechanical Arbivore &reg . The machine had stopped, an' its fuel jug was plumb empty . . . but right next to it lay two locust trees' worth of split firewood.</p><p>Ol' Art shot a few dozen more pictures, then left to file his story. On the way he stopped in at the Plumtree Crossin' Gen'ral Store to thank his cousin Billy fer the great lead. Billy beamed . . . but-int'restin'ly enough-the rest of the cronies didn't join in thet conversation. Seems they was all huddled around the store's potbellied heater . . . yawnin', sneezin', an' lookin' a sheet er two to th' wind!</p><p>The very next evenin'-fist as one of those mizzerble March snowstorms was commencin' to commence-another car drove up to Purvis's house. This time, a tow-sack-shaped feller stepped out an' demanded, "You the smart-aleck liar who fed my reporter a bunch of buncombe about some mechanical wood-mauler? I'm Barcan Bite, editor of the <em>Republican Courier</em>, an' I'm not about to print thet kind of malarky in my newspaper, you read me?"</p><p>"Suit yerself," Purvis replied.</p><p>"I cain't afford to waste my reporter's work, though, so I aim to get a story out of this somehow. . . even if it only shows what a lyin' fool you are! Take me out to this clattertrap!"</p><p>So Purvis got the red jug, led Barcan out to the Arbivore &reg , took a test swig from the demijohn, smiled approvin'ly, an' started to invert it over the fuel tank. But Barcan grabbed the jug from his arm, sniffed it, an' took a swig hisself. "Whee-oo! Man, thet must be 160-proof likker! " He went on to take another swaller, an' then another, an' then another, afore he'd let Purvis set the jug in place. Jacobs cranked the engine, give its whistle three good toots ("thet's to tell it to haul the wood"), then turned for home.</p><p>"I guess you expect me to follow you, too," Barran shouted, "so's I cain't see what trick gits pulled out here."</p><p>"Shoot," said Purvis, "what good's a wood-cuttin' machine if I have to waste time watchin' it work?"</p><p>Barcan weren't convinced, howev'r . . . he perched hisself next to the alkyhol-sippin' contraption an' waited. 'Twern't long afore night fell an' snowflakes started to cover the ground. Feelin' the chill spreadin' clear to his bones, the persistent editor pulled the demijohn off the machine an' inverted it over his own fuel tank. Subsyquently, he felt a strong surge of warmth, an' then-followin' a few more sips-he become downright electrified with energy!</p><p>Seemed the 'shine had give Barcan's reasonin' powers a sharp boost, too, fer he quickly decided thet-given prime, 160proof corn squeezin'sthe Arbivore &reg jist might be able to do what were claimed fer it. An' from there it were jist a short jump of logic to a decision to haul the wood to the porch hisselj . . . so's to avoid wastin' the hooch on what-work er notwasn't nothin' but a pile of mindless metal.</p><p>Purvis awoke next mornin' to find the fierce March snowstorm over . . . the peaceful earth clothed in white . . . two locust trees' worth of firewood neatly stacked on the porch . . . an' one newspaper editor snorin' on the kitchen floor with a red jug-empty-by his side.</p><p>It were somewhat later on thet Mister Bite finally come to, his body achin' from hair to heel an' his head throbbin' fit to bust. He surveyed the scene jist long enough to remember perzackly what had gone on the precedin' night, then stumbled into his car an' headed down fer town. (At a sharp bend he noticed where a bunch of pickup trucks what had started up the holler had skidded off the road. A passel of blue-faced old locals was pushin' the vehicles an' yellin' at one another . . . but Barcan were in no shape to stop an' cover thet story.)</p><p>The very next week the <em>Republican Courier</em> ran Arthur Scribe's article on the Mechanical Arbivore &reg , jist as the rovin' reporter had written it. There was, though, one little addition at the end of the piece. "The <em>Courier</em>," it read, "will let its readers determine the veracity of this story for themselves. All we know is that there's a sucker-and a sipper-born every minute.-Your Editor."</p><p><em>"Life is a game, the object of which is to discover the object of the game."</em></p>
