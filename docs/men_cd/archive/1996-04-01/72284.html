            		<p><strong>BARTERS & BOOTSTRAPS</strong><br /></p>        <p><em>The inside dirt on finding and selling wild edibles.</em>    </p>		<h5 id="byline"><em>By Robert Rowe</em></h5>                            <p>      If someone were to tell you that you could be making $200,      $300, or even $500 a day picking mushrooms, your first      thought might be: "Are these the same kind that were passed      around campus 20 years ago?" Not to worry. Commercial      trading in wild edible and decidedly nonpsychedelic      mushrooms has grown tremendously in the last ten years. A      little research, attention to detail, a willingness to      learn, and some woods sense are all you need to become      proficient in this trade. The most prolific commercial      activity occurs in the Northwest, but there are marketable      mushrooms in virtually every area of North America, and      pickers at the height of the season can make thousands of      dollars.    </p>    <p>      I am often asked, "If these mushrooms are so valuable, why      isn't somebody growing them in their barn?" Some, such as      the shiitake mushroom, can be cultivated, however, the      mushrooms listed here are generally mycorrhizal in nature.      In other words, they are dependent upon the root system of      the trees that they are growing under. If you can figure      out a way to duplicate those roots in a barn, you'll make a      fortune. Until then, we've just got to get out there and      find them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Getting Started</strong>    </p>    <p>      Do not attempt to go out and pick a mushroom to eat without      getting someone knowledgeable to confirm identification of      that species. Picking and eating without proper study is      literally a prescription for disaster, given the number of      poisonous varieties that often look perplexingly like their      culinary counterparts. If you do not know anyone who can      help, contact the North American Mycological Association at      3556 Oakwood, Ann Arbor, MI 48104-5213, (313) 971-2552.      They have chapters all over the country with many people      willing to help out. Turn to the next page for a brief      guide to some of the market favorites.    </p>    <p>      If you are in an area like the Northwest where much      commercial activity occurs, it would behoove you to find a      buying station to see what species they are taking in. Most      buyers will purchase more than one species even though they      are in a particular area for a particular mushroom. These      buying stations are much like clearinghouses of      information, and good places to track down pickers coming      out of the brush to ask them some questions. Don't bother      asking a mushroom picker exactly where his patch is; you      are likely to get directions to the local dump. Mushroom      patches are closely guarded secrets, especially as some      species produce in the same spot year after year.    </p>    <p>      Your equipment will consist of sturdy work clothes. Good      hiking boots or the lighter hiking tennis shoes are a must.      Get a handy Swiss knife for cutting stems and a few      five-gallon plastic buckets and you are ready to go. I also      carry a compass for terrain that I am unfamiliar with as      well as a USGS map. Permits for picking vary from region to      region. Be sure to check into this thoroughly, as a      confiscated bucket as well as a fat ticket is two days lost      picking time. The average price for a ten-day picking      permit from the Forest Service in the Northwest is $10. If      you are picking for personal use, permits are free. Private      lands are generally unregulated. Simply ask the owner for      permission and you'll usually get it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Selling What You Find</strong>    </p>    <p>      So, we have a pile of mushrooms-what do we do with      them? You may have to do a little creative selling if you      are not in an area where there are established buyers. I      have gotten my best prices for wild edibles from chefs in      the higher priced hotels and restaurants. Any chef worth      his paycheck will jump at the chance to have a somewhat      steady source of wild mushrooms, and all are familiar with      the various varieties. This may necessitate spending some      time on the phone working out schedules. But the higher      prices you receive from direct marketing like this make it      the preferable method of sale. New York, Chicago, San      Francisco, and most other major cities have a variety of      places to market wild mushrooms. Even small towns with      enough local restaurants will have a buyer.    </p>    <p>      Drying before selling is a handy option that works well for      mushrooms like the morel. It's virtually a given that      you'll be able to sell them to a wholesaler or directly to      restaurants. Prices for dried mushrooms hover around      $75-$100 per pound, but find your market first before you      commit yourself to the lengthy drying process.    </p>        <p>      <strong>THE MOST POPULAR WILD EDIBLE SPECIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Morels <em>(Morchella elata/Morchella      esculenta)</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Morels are a spring mushroom and can be very elusive at      times. In the Pacific Northwest you can find them in great      quantities after major forest fires. From this      predictability they are subject to much commercial activity      and are well regulated by the USFS after fires that occur      on Forest Service lands. Private forest lands are a      different story and may require some artful speaking on the      pickers part to get permission. For most commercial pickers      of the black morel, research begins by monitoring the      forest fires that occur the summer prior to a spring      season. From the Cascade Range east to the western slopes      of the Rockies, from Northern California all the way to      southern Alaska, including British Columbia and the Yukon      Territory, any timbered country is subject to this      phenomenon as long as weather permits. Good snow packs and      a wet spring will generally produce an astounding crop of      morels on these fire lands. Aggressive pickers commonly      bring in 75-100 pounds a day. Commercial shippers are      particularly fond of the fire morel for the simple reason      that the fire that produces them in such numbers also      eliminates that year's insect population that so love to      munch this tasty treat.    </p>    <p>      Michigan also has a well-known and much anticipated spring      morel season, with accompanying festivals. These morels are      of the harder-to-find variety called the esculenta, or as      referred to in the Northwest, the "natural." Generally,      they are found in lower river bottomlands under leaf trees      such as elms. There are several offshoot varieties that      show themselves in areas such as old apple orchards.      Generally speaking, what the natural lacks in quantity, it      makes up for in size. The morel can be found nearly      everywhere in the United States, but it is well known for      being cagey and hard to find. Keep in mind that trees are      required as well as moisture.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Matsutake/Japanese Pine</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>(<em>Tricholoma magnivelare</em> )</strong>    </p>    <p>      Recently reclassified from <em>Armilliria genera</em> and      listed on older volumes as <em>Armilliria</em>      <em>ponderosa</em> , the pine mushroom is the most valuable      of all wild edibles. The Japanese often pay unbelievable      prices for this imported delicacy. The 1992 fall season      recorded a price of $525 a pound for the number one grade.      Competition is fierce at buying stations, often with price      wars erupting between buyers vying for pickers' products.      Most commercial activity occurs in the Cascade Range of      Washington and Oregon, with many pounds being harvested in      British Columbia also. This mushroom is not limited to      those areas, though. Southern Puget Sound has an excellent      crop, as does Michigan and the Adirondack Mountains of New      York. Granted, most commercial activity does occur on the      West Coast where consistent crops are expected, but this      should not prevent a picker from developing his own market      where the pine is found. Ninety-nine percent of all pines      are shipped fresh market to Japan within 24 hours, but      there are many and varied Asian communities throughout the      United States where produce stores and restaurants would      jump at the chance to purchase this mushroom.    </p>    <p>      Finding the pine does represent a challenge. The most      common method is looking under its namesake, the ponderosa      pine tree. It can be as easy as taking a walk and spotting      mushrooms that have already emerged from the ground.      Experienced pickers practice a method of looking for      unnatural humps in the pine needle beds, indicating a young      mushroom forcing its way to the surface. Since these      younger mushrooms are of a higher grade than mature      mushrooms, this method will certainly reap more profits.      And the pine is not limited to pine trees, as I have found      many pounds under fir and even hemlocks. This mushroom is      mycorrhizal in nature, which means that it has a      relationship to the root system of the tree it is growing      under.    </p>    <p>      Grading pines is relatively easy. There are five grades,      and all are dependent on the "veil" that attaches from the      cap to the stem. Grade one is a young mushroom whose veil      is attached 100 percent with no holes. Grade two has 50      percent attachment. Grade three has a veil varying from 50      percent down to a clinging piece. Grade four is a fully      mature mushroom that has flattened out. At the buying      station, grading can make or break your day, so finding a      buyer who is consistent with his technique is a must to the      commercial picker.    </p>        <p>      The Chanterelle <strong>( <em>Cantherellus cibarius</em>      )</strong> This bright yellow variety is well-known the      world over.    </p>        <p>      Once again, great quantities are shipped from the Northwest      with the bulk being harvested from private and national      forest lands in the southern Puget Sound region. It is,      however, a mushroom you can find across the United      States-a family friend has found good quantities in      the southern portion of Louisiana. The Chanterelle is a      fall mushroom that generally fruits after that season's      first rains. In Northern California you can sometimes find      them in the spring in limited quantities. The astute      mushroom picker marks his patch carefully on his map, as      the chanterelle will generally show itself in the same spot      year after year.    </p>    <p>      There is a rule I apply to chanterelle picking that works      well for me. I call it the Triple D rule. Triple D refers      to three conditions that are very conducive to      chanterelles: deep, dark, and dank. These are heavy timber      conditions, but old growth timber is not a prerequisite. I      have found dozens of pounds in second-growth and even      third-growth timber stands. Their tree of choice is the      Douglas fir, but I have found them growing under several      varieties of needle trees, including spruce and hemlock, as      well as leaf trees such as the tan oaks in Northern      California.    </p>    <p>      The chanterelle is a mushroom that fares well in the cooler      and does not experience much weight loss from a week or ten      days in storage. It is a well-known mushroom, and selling      them to restaurants is relatively easy. Your largest      concern should be to pick the mushroom clean. One or two      dirty mushrooms in your bucket or basket can dirty up the      whole batch, necessitating a painstaking, time-consuming      cleaning process. Cut your stems while in the field,      preferably while the mushroom is in the ground.<br />    </p>        <p>      The King <em>(Cep/Porcint)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>(Boletus edulis)</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      The king is aptly named, for it is a giant among gourmet      edible mushrooms. I have come across specimens over 12      inches tall and weighing in at nearly two pounds. Like the      chanterefle, the fang is known the world over and is the      favorite of the Italians and Germans. Most boletes (and      there are many varieties) are found in the fall. I have in      fact found kings in the same area that I had found      chanterelles earlier in the spring. Generally speaking, its      tree of choice is the spruce. And, once again, people pick      it in great quantities in the Northwest, but there are some      kings that are found in the spring in higher elevations of      the Cascades and Rocky Mountains-most after the spring snow      melts.    </p>    <p>      The Triple D rule also applies to this mushroom, and so      does marking your map for further seasons down the road.      The king is also highly sus ceptible to worms. Before      shipping fresh to your favorite chef, I suggest you slice      the older specimens in half to check for these pesky      creatures. Even one single worm hole is enough for a chef      to reject that mushroom. Drying these tainted mushrooms is      the accepted way of salvaging these mushrooms and marketing      them. The king has three grades as far as a commercial      buyer is concerned. Grade one is the small, newly emerged      "button." This young king has very white gills at this time      and all aspects of the mushroom are firm. Grade two reveals      slightly yellowish gills and a larger mushroom. Grade three      is a fully mature mushroom that is worm free.    </p>    <p>      I have heard reports of kings being found in the Northeast      as far north as Maine. Michigan has a fine fall season, as      does Colorado. The king is also a mush room found across      the United States wherever there is timber. Due to the      different varieties of the boletes, be sure that you have      identified the king positively.    </p>    <p>      These four species are by no means the only wild edibles      commercially marketable. A few others include the oyster      mushroom <em>(Pleurotus ostreatus)</em>    </p>    <p>      the hedge hog <em>(Hydnum repandum)</em> , the early morel      <em>(Verpa bohemica)</em> , the false morel ( <em>Gyromitra      esculanta</em> ), the black trumpet <em>(Canthereluus      fallax)</em> , and chicken of the woods    </p>    <p>      <em>(Laetiporus sulphurues).</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Picker's Philosophy</strong>    </p>    <p>      Mushroom picking is a very nonintrusive,      non-environmentally degrading occupation. There is little      chance that one is going to affect future crops of      mushrooms since each mushroom releases millions of spores.      Problems do develop when pickers disregard property      boundaries and are disrespectful toward the environment.      "Pack it in, pack it out," is a wise phrase coined by the      USFS. Come across a gate that you need to open? Then close      it after yourself. Be gentle; pick conscientiously. Don't      pull mushrooms; cut the stems while in the ground so as not      to disturb the mycelium (the portion of the mushroom      submerged in the ground). Bear in mind that you are picking      the fruit of a mold.<br />      <br />      Mushroom picking is also very addicting. Finding your first      patch can be quite a thrill. Even after picking hundreds      and hundreds of pounds over the years, I am still excited      beyond description when I stumble upon the ultimate patch.      What is the ultimate patch? One so thick that you can't      take a step without crushing a handful. Possible? You bet.      Good hunting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Suggested Readings & Writings</strong>    </p>    <p>      • <em>Income Opportunities in Special Forest      Products:</em> Bulletin 666, by the United States Forest      Service.
