        <p>Despite the obvious benefits of long-handled garden tools, many gardeners still prefer those with shorter handles. Multipurpose tools - and quite a few head de signs - seem to come strictly with the short handles. Most of these tools, however, are configured and balanced in such a way that the short handle isn't a handicap. Here are some of my favorites:</p><p><strong>HORI-HORI</strong> If I had to pick only one gardening tool, the traditional Japanese gardener's knife would be it. On the traditional Hori-Hori, the deeply dished, six-inch carbon steel blade is attached to a hand-filling hardwood handle. One edge of the blade is sharp, the other is serrated, and the whole thing tapers to a point. All together, this tool combines a thin trowel with a knife, a saw and a triangle hoe for weeding in tight spaces. It works beautifully as a transplanting tool.</p><p>A more recent innovation is a stainless steel version with a slightly longer (seven inches) blade and handle, which still weighs less than the traditional design. The stainless blade has a depth gauge embossed in it.<br /></p><p><strong>ANGLE WEEDER</strong> The double offset of the curved blade on this nifty tool more than makes up for the short handle. The six-inch blade has a serrated cutting edge on the inside of the curve and a split tip. Known as the "three-in-one" weeder, this design is good for cutting weed roots deep beneath the surface, prying up tap roots with the split tip, or cleaning the cracks and crevices in sidewalks and rockeries. Unfortunately for lefties, the Angle Weeder is only available in right-handed models.</p><p><strong>SOIL SCOOP</strong> Billed as "the do-it-all digging tool," the Soil Scoop actually lives up to its marketing description. Mounted to a six-inch handle is a deep-dish, stainless steel trowel blade that tapers and bends upward into a sharply pointed triangle tip. The balance of both edges are serrated. The Soil Scoop serves all the purposes of a trowel, and is sometimes even better than a standard trowel because the deep-dish blade makes it much</p><p>easier to transfer soil and garden amendments. In addition, the sharp, angled tip makes this tool a good close-quarters weeder that's also ideal for furrowing and making trenches for bulbs. The serrated edges work well for cutting roots, and the overall shape is perfect for digging transplanting holes.</p>
