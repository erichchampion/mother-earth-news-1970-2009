        <p>I was at dinner with friends when the discussion came around to the pockets of low rainfall in our area. Our tomatoes were taking a terrible beating, and it showed in their withered leaves and poor fruit.</p><p>One fellow suggested placing plastic containers (gallon jugs or 2-liter beverage containers) in the ground at the time of planting. Punch holes in the bottoms and sides of the containers with a finishing nail or a drill, bury them with a few inches showing and fill with each watering; their narrow mouths almost eliminate water loss due to evaporation. Also, if you punch just a dozen or so small holes, the slow draining of the water into nearby soil gives plants more time to drink up.</p><p>If you must place fertilizer in these reservoirs, make it one quarter the strength or weaker to avoid burning roots.</p><p>Frank Abair, Jr.<br />Greenfield, Tennessee</p>
