        <p><em>Where can I buy Saler cows and at what price?</em><br />JAMES<br />Prairie Home, Missouri<br />The Saler (sah-lehr) is an ancient breed, originally from the mountains of France. A distinctive mahogany color, this breed is hardy as an anvil, births easily and is one of the best calf milk-producers of any breed. They all thrive on almost any type of graze and will outlive most cows by several years. In short, Salers are a great homestead cow. They're rare however, so there is no auction market for them and you are on your own, pricewise.<br />For sturdy, low-maintenance Salers, try:</p><p><a href="http://www.salerscattle.com/" target="_blank">Glen Osprey Farm</a></p><p>R.R.#6<br />Shelburne, Ontario<br />Canada, L0N 1S9<br />(519) 925-6412<br />Fax: (519) 925-1297<br />E-mail <a href="mailto:dpease@salerscattle.com" target="_blank">dpease@salerscattle.com</a>Â </p>
