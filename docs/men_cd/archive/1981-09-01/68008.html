                <p>      "To forget pain is to be painless ...to forget care is to      be rid of it ...to go abroad is to accomplish both." (Mark      Twain)    </p>        <p>		 Photos By Will Webber, Frank Shell, Sobek Expeditions,    Inc. Air NEw Zealand, Findhorn Foundation and Mother's Staff		</p>                                <p>      MOTHER's upcoming travel program is so extensive      that-in the space available here-we can do      little more than provide the briefest of outlines for each      tour. But if one of the following trips appeals to you,      send us your deposit by certified check or money order to      assure your place ...or-to get more details      -write to Mother's Tours, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791.    </p>    <p>      A TOUCH OF MAGIC    </p>    <p>      Our newest travel offering-which we call A Visit to      Findhorn and Friends- will take place from May 20 to      June 6, 1982, and is a tour designed for people who would      like to explore inner, as well as outer, realms. Flying to      Scotland, we'll first go to Findhorn (see the article on      071-032-01 ), where we'll participate in an "Experience      Week" ...an introduction to all phases of the life of this      alternative community, including lending a hand in the      various work departments that help make this such a      remarkably beautiful and well -functioning planetary      village.    </p>    <p>      The following week we'll travel to Scotland's      <em>opposite</em> coast ...on the Hebridean island of      Erraid, which the Findhorn folks caretaker and are      developing into a self-sufficient community. While there,      we'll also spend some time on the nearby sacred isle of      Iona, a "place of power" in both Celtic and early Christian      tradition.    </p>    <p>      This visit to a unique, visionary community (set among the      rainbows, golden gorse, and historical sights of northern      Scotland) will end with several days in the wonderful city      of Edinburgh ...and the entire trip will cost approximately      $1,600, all-inclusive except for a few meals. A $200      deposit will reserve your ticket for this magical      encounter.    </p>    <p>      AN ALPINE ADVENTURE    </p>    <p>      Strolling through a flower-strewn Alpine meadow-with      picture-book Swiss and Austrian villages far below      and jagged, snowcapped peaks rising up in the      background-is the kind of experience that can      rekindle a person's wonder at the beauty our earth is      capable of. For that reason, we have decided to offer from      June 11 to 26, 1982-a Wild Plants Walk in the Alps.      After a stopover to enjoy Holland's legendary,      once-in-a-decade flower show, we'll take you on mountain      footpaths near Salzburg, Kitzbuhel, Innsbruck,      Liechtenstein, Zurich, and Geneva ...and learn about the      edible wild plants and herbs that grow along the      spectacularly lovely route.    </p>    <p>      The tour is tentatively priced at $1,770 ...which will      include airfare, camping equipment, lodging, and two meals      a day. Send $200 to reserve your place.    </p>    <p>      A HIMALAYAN HIGH    </p>    <p>      You may think the Abominable Snowman is nothing more than a      legend ... but the Nepalese take the beast's existence      <em>for granted! You'll</em> have an opportunity to look      into the matter yourself on our three-week (January 25 to      February 17, 1982) trek into the yeti's reputed home in the      rugged and remote Arun Valley of Nepal. This heady      adventure also offers you the chance to explore the      colorful bazaars and temples of Kathmandu ...hike through      forests of 60foot rhododendrons ...negotiate suspended      bridges (such as the one pictured on the facing page)      ...and meet with an incredible variety of native peoples.    </p>    <p>      In addition, as we meander higher and higher along an      abandoned trade route between the towering crests of      Everest and Kanchenjunga (the first and third highest      mountain peaks on earth), you can expect to behold some of      the world's most spectacular scenery and a wealth of      wildlife. This exciting expedition coordinated by Journeys,      an environmental tour operator-costs $2,785 (the      price covers everything except some meals in Kathmandu) and      requires a $300 deposit.    </p>    <p>      A WONDERFUL JUXTAPOSITION    </p>    <p>      The day after our trekkers return from Nepal, another group      will embark on MOTHER's third Solar Tour of Israel      (February 17 to March 2, 1982), which is, again,      cosponsored with Jordan College. And one of the delightful      aspects of this trip is the constant contrast provided by      that country's technical advances in alternative energy      forms and its ancient, historical landmarks.    </p>    <p>      For example, the mighty fortress of Masada lies just up the      road from a 250-acre Dead Sea solar pond that will      generate 25 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year      ...and we'll take in <em>both.</em> In fact, our visits to      solar collector manufacturers, to alternative-energy      kibbutzim, <em>and</em> with top researchers and scientists      <em>will often</em> be combined with trips to Roman ruins,      as well as to places rich in Biblical significance.    </p>    <p>      And-best of all-the price of this 13day      excursion has actually <em>decreased,</em> since we first      announced it, to $1,495. (A $200 deposit will hold your      place.)    </p>    <p>      A SEMINAR IN PARADISE    </p>    <p>      While many North Americans are beginning to stoke up their      woodstoves, folks on MOTHER's ecological seminar in the      South Seas will be able to spend their mornings snorkeling      through beautiful coral gardens. In the afternoons, they'll      bike, scuba, play tennis, beachcomb on uninhabited islets,      explore the ruins of Polynesian temples, or sail outrigger      canoes. And the evenings will feature beach barbecues and      dancing under balmy, tropical skies.    </p>    <p>      All that might seem glorious enough, but our journey to      Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Raiatea offers-as is our aim      on all our tours-a great deal more. Each morning,      when you dive into those crystal-clear lagoons to study the      behavior of reef fishes, you'll be doing so under the      guidance of Anne and Paul Ehrlich-our Ecoscience      columnist sand their equally knowledgeable friends and      colleagues, John and Cheryl Holdren. Then, after dinner,      our tour leaders will answer your questions on some of the      most pressing ecological problems of our time.    </p>    <p>      This journey-originally scheduled for November 27 to      December 11, 1981-has been moved forward: It's now      set for November 29 to December 13, 1981. The price of the      tour, however, remains the same ...$2,295, including most      meals, and we need only $100 to reserve one of the few      spaces still open.    </p>    <p>      A CRUISE IN THE SUN    </p>    <p>      While some of our readers snooze under South Pacific palms,      others will enjoy a cruise, aboard the M/S World      Renaissance, that will combine stopovers at the islands of      Puerto Rico, Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Saint      Thomas, and Barbados with the study of alternative energy      systems. Cosponsored with Jordan College and the University      of Puerto Rico's Center for Energy and Environmental      Research (CEER), the trip promises to provide numerous      opportunities to explore energy facilities in the Caribbean      islands. In addition, there'll be shipboard lectures on      alternative energy options.    </p>    <p>      This week-away-from-winter-and-worries, which begins in San      Juan, is scheduled for December 5-12, 1981 at a cost of      $745 per person ...and $200 reserves your space aboard.    </p>    <p>      A RIVER LIKE NO OTHER    </p>    <p>      Imagine yourself days from any hint of civilization,      running a river that's been fully explored only in the last      decade. There, icebergs the size of small towns crack off      the face of sapphire blue glaciers ...crash into the water      with a force that makes the ground tremble like jelly      ...then spin slowly in the waterlooking like mammoth,      prismatic jewels - while bald eagles soar overhead.      As night falls, the aurora borealis flashes its furious      colors across the horizon, and wild creatures make tracks      outside your tent.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to make that fantasy a reality, join our      August 15-26, 1982 Alaska Raft Trip on the Tatshenshini      River. It costs only $1,490 from Haines, Alaska and back to      Haines (the deposit is $250) and there's just no      way-in the space here-that we can even begin to      describe this incredible adventure that Sobek Expeditions      is putting together for us. As Henry Morton Stanley once      said: "Ah, fellows, this is a journey worthy to be called a      journey! "    </p>    <p>      But then, we think that's true of all of Mother's Tours.    </p>
