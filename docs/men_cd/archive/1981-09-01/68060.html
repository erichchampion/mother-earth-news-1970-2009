                 <p>      Here's a blockbuster weapon you can use in the fight      against overprocessed foods:    </p>        <p>		Diane Huneke     </p>        <p>      I don't mean to brag, but I've converted a family of      devoted sugar-frosted-cereal eaters into devout granola      lovers with my own homemade version of "a good way to start      the day". I must admit, though, that I spent quite a bit of      time throwing together mediocre batches of the breakfast      food before I finally hit on what 1 believe to be a      <em>great</em> combination of ingredients (including      unrefined peanut oil for an especially nutty flavor      ...molasses <em>and</em> honey for added body ...and a      goodly dose of energy-giving nuts, seeds, and dried fruit).    </p>    <p>      One of the basic secrets of making tasty granola is mixing      the ingredients well, so when you set out to try this      recipe-conduct the operation in a very <em>large</em>      bowl or pan ...or, lacking that, in your (clean and wiped!)      kitchen sink. Also, it's best to combine the wet and dry      ingredients separately before stirring them together      thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      First, blend 6 cups of old-fashioned <em>(not</em>      quick-cooking) oat flakes, 2 cups of roasted soy splits, 2      cups of raw sunflower seeds (use 4 cups of the seeds if soy      splits aren't available), 2 cups of wheat germ, 1 cup of      bran, 1-1/2 cups of milk powder, 2 teaspoons of sea salt,      and 3 tablespoons of cinnamon.    </p>    <p>      Then, in a separate bowl, blend 3/4 cup of molasses, 1/2      cup of honey, 1 cup of unrefined peanut oil, and 3      tablespoons of vanilla extract.    </p>    <p>      Now, combine the two mixtures well ...spread the granola on      large, flat pans ...and bake it in a 250°F oven (a      higher temperature will scorch the <em>outside</em> of the      cereal before its inside is done), stirring occasionally      until it turns just barely brown. At that point, dump the      toasted treat out onto your clean-paper-covered kitchen      table and add 2 cups each of coconut, raw cashew pieces,      and raisins or diced dates. While the healthful fare is      still warm, put it into tightly sealed containers, where      it'll keep for ages (though the food is much too delicious      to hang around your house for <em>very</em> long). You'll      find this comestible a great morning cereal ...a perfect      snack ...and an excellent topping for fruit salad, ice      cream, or apple crisp!    </p>		<hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: You can use this recipe as a line trail      food.. and more of such carry along edibles are described      in "Pioneer Pocket Food" on page 132.    </p>
