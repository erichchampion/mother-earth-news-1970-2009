                <p>      MARC BRISTOL:    </p>            <p>      Even homesteaders need to relax and enjoy themselves from      time to time, right? And almost everybody these days wants      to cut his or her cost of living. So how about a little      do-it-yourself entertainment?    </p>    <p>      And that's what this column is all about. Down-home music      that you can make ...and the instruments (which, in some      cases, you can also make!) to play that music on.    </p>    <p>      The important thing is that this is your column. If you      like it, write to me and- let me know. If you have some      ideas for this feature, let me know that. I'm open to any      suggestions or information you care to contribute. I'll      even try to answer your questions about downhome music      ...but-both for the benefit of all MOTHER's readers and to      ease my correspondence load-I'll deal with those questions,      whenever possible, here in this column ...rather than in      personal letters.    </p>    <p>      Address your correspondence for this column and this column      only-to Marc Bristol, 18520 312th Ave. N.E., Duvall, Wash.      98019.    </p>    <h3>      Bluegrass-The Bright      Experiment    </h3>    <p>      Back in the 60's I became really excited by the theme music      for the (otherwise somewhat moronic) television program      <em>The Beverly Hillbillies.</em> The bright, new sound      that caught my ear came from the banjo of bluegrasser Earl      Scruggs. His picking style impressed many other people,      too, and by the time Earl had done the theme music for the      movie <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em> (in 196?), nearly      <em>everyone</em> had heard of bluegrass and knew that it      was uptempo, acoustic country music featuring a lot of      sparkling banjo and fiddle work.    </p>    <p>      The roots of this invigorating style go all the way back to      old-time string band music. However, it was Kentuckian Bill      Monroe (born in 1911) who developed and defined the special      sound of bluegrass, and gave the music its name.    </p>    <p>      Bill started his career by playing backup guitar-at local      dances-with his uncle, fiddler Pen Vandever (later to be      immortalized in some of Bill's best-known songs), who      exerted a strong influence on the young man's style. Then,      in the 30's, when Bill and his brother Charlie landed a      radio job as a singing duo (with Charlie on guitar and Bill      on mandolin), they evolved the vocal style that's the soul      of bluegrass.    </p>    <p>      After the brothers drifted apart, Monroe put together a      group he called the Bluegrass Boys, and began to fine-tune      his distinctive sound. It wasn't until the late 40's,      however, when he hired Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, that      the banjo assumed its position of importance in the genre.      Earl's driving, three-finger picking technique was new and      exciting, and his banjo style soon became the instrumental      trademark of bluegrass music.    </p>    <p>      Lester and Earl eventually got tired of being on the road      with Bill and broke off to form their own act, the Foggy      Mountain Boys, but by then the bluegrass sound had been      defined. To this day, the banjo players in Bill's band pick      in a style similar to the one Earl created.    </p>    <p>      Nowadays, Scruggs and his sons, as the Earl Scruggs Revue,      are playing country rock. Many purists are outraged by this      change, but it's perfectly all right with me! It was, after      all, experimentation that gave birth to bluegrass in the      first place, and a denial of the right to explore new      frontiers is contrary to the whole spirit of American      music.    </p>    <p>      PERFORMERS TO LOOK FOR    </p>    <p>      There have been many musicians, in the past 40 years,      who've learned much from their association with Bill      Monroe's Bluegrass Boys, and several have gone on to make      names for themselves. One such performer is Jimmy      Martin-lead vocalist and guitarist with Bill in the late      40's and early 50's-who later formed his own group, the      Sunny Mountain Boys. Although he's been ostracized by some      bluegrass fans for using drums in his band, Martin is one      of my favorites.    </p>    <p>      I first heard Jimmy on the album Will <em>the Circle Be      Unbroken? ...put</em> together by the Nitty Gritty Dirt      band. The idea behind the record was to introduce two      groups of performers who were interested in different      aspects of the same branch of music. (Needless to say, the      album's promotors were equally interested in consolidating      the two audiences, in hopes of achieving wider sales.) The      Dirt Band had been playing bluegrass primarily for young      people, so their manager decided to bring them together      with several older stars from the traditional country music      scene. He rounded up Roy Acuff, Maybelle Carter, Doe      Watson, Earl Scruggs, Pete "Brother Oswald" Kirby, Jimmy      Martin, Merle Travis, Vassar Clements, and others ...and      took them to a studio in Nashville for a series of      sessions. The result was a classic: a three-record      production, cut "live" and mixed on the spot.    </p>    <p>      Half of the album is devoted to "breakdowns" (bluegrass      instrumentals), and the other half is full of wonderful      renditions of classic country tunes sung by the      abovementioned luminaries, supported by the Dirt Band. If      you were to buy only one album of bluegrass/ country music      for your collection, this would be a good choice.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if you want to collect a <em>number</em>      of records, be sure to look for "Uncle Josh" Graves, a fine      dobro player who has recorded with Bill Monroe and Flatt      & Scruggs as well as on his own ...Mike Auldridge, also      on dobro, whom you may have heard in recordings by Emmylou      Harris and Linda Ronstadt ...brothers Jim and Jesse      Reynolds, a vocal harmony duo specializing in that high,      lonesome sound ...and Vassar Clements, the powerful      instrumentalist who played fiddle with Bill Monroe and then      moved on to incorporate more rock and jazz into his      individual style.    </p>    <p>      There are a number of older <em>groups</em> worthy of      mention, too, including the Stanley Brothers, the Osborne      Brothers, Don Reno and the Tennessee Cutups, Mac Wiseman,      and Buck White, among others. And, if you're still hungry      for bluegrass after listening to <em>those</em> acts,      there's a new generation of performers ... some favoring a      traditional sound, others leaning toward the experimental.      Among such players are Hot Rize, Larry McNeely, Jack      Skinner, Byron Berline, the New Cache Valley Drifters, the      Newgrass Revival, and Peter Rowan.    </p>    <p>      FESTIVALS GALORE    </p>    <p>      As this style of music has increased in popularity,      bluegrass festivals have become a more and more important      phenomenon in this country, with new events popping up each      year. Attending these shows is a good way to make contact      with the music and to hear some of the performers I've      spoken of ...as well as up-and-coming local "grassers".    </p>    <p>      If there's no regular festival in your neck of the woods,      you might think about starting one. All it requires is a      suitable location (remember to have plenty of camping space      if the affair is going to last more than one day) plus      someone or, better yet, <em>several</em> someone--with a      lot of energy and organizational ability.    </p>    <p>      And while we're on the subject, I'd like to encourage      <em>all</em> promotors of bluegrass events to keep open      minds. Variety is the spice of life, and it would be      stimulating to see some string swing bands, jug bands, solo      performers, musical saws, and other forms of acoustical      country music in addition to the traditional Monroe-style      fare. The broader scope of such a program might well      enlarge the audience for bluegrass, and could even help      encourage the birth of some new form of music as wonderful      as bluegrass itself.    </p>    <p>      One gathering with wide appeal is the National Folk      Festival, held each year at Wolf Trap Farm in Vienna,      Virginia. This event (it ran from August 7 to 9 this year)      is put on by the National Council for the Traditional Arts,      which occasionally publishes a large directory of annual      festivals. (I previously reported that this was a yearly      publication ...not so! And while the only issue now      available will not have fully up-to-date 1981 listings, the      addresses and other particulars of the regular      get-togethers that are included could be of great help to      those people planning vacations or hoping to tour the      festivals as performers. As of this past July, a copy of      the 1980 calendar could still be ordered at a discounted      price of $3.00 postpaid.) For more information, write NCTA,      Dept. TMEN, 1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W., Suite 1118,      Washington, D.C. 20036.    </p>    <p>      PUBLICATIONS TO PONDER    </p>    <p>      One of my ongoing aims in writing this column is to alert      you to specialty publications dealing with aspects of      homegrown music that I don't have space to cover here. One      such publication I ran across recently is <em>International      Banjo</em> ($15 a year in the U.S., $20 elsewhere), Dept.      TMEN, P.O. Box 328, Kissimmee, Florida 32741. This one      focuses on various banjo styles: bluegrass, tenor,      plectrum, and more.    </p>    <p>      Although I may have referred to it before, <em>Bluegrass      Unlimited</em> certainly deserves a mention in any column      about Bill Monroe's spiritual progeny. Its address is Dept.      TMEN, Box 111, Broad Run, Virginia 22014. Festival listings      come out each spring in this publication.    </p>    <p>      Some people up in Michigan are printing a really nice      magazine called <em>North Country Folk. I</em> have the      second issue, and it contains a wide variety of articles on      different aspects of traditional culture ...including--but      not limited to-music. There's even a nice article on the      musical saw written by none other than Dan Wallace, the      owner of Mussehl & Westphal (the company that has been      making professional musical saws since 1921). The article      is fascinating ...and so is the rest of the issue, which      features pieces on ethnic music, radio listening, morris      dancing, sugar maple culture, fishing, and folk art for      children. There are even plans for a treble version (called      a "twanger") of the old washtub bass. It utilizes a small      coffee can, a foot- long strip of flexible wood, a tuner,      and an old guitar string. To subscribe to this enjoyable      quarterly, just send $10 to <em>North Country Folk,</em>      Dept. TMEN, Box 189, Ironwood, Michigan 49938.    </p>    <p>      Another source for listings of bluegrass festivals-as well      as musical doings of every kind around the world-is the In      <em>ternational Guide to Music Festivals</em> by Douglas      Smith and Nancy Barton. In the guide you'll find      sections-broken down by country-on folk, classical, and      jazz (as well as bluegrass) festivals.    </p>    <p>      Finally, my thanks go to Marjorie Bennett for turning me on      to <em>Banjo International ...and</em> to Dan Wallace for      the copy of <em>North Country Folk.</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For a look at clogging the bluegrass dance      style-turn backtopage40!    </p>
