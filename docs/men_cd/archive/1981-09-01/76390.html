        			<h3>	 DR. PAUL MACCREADY    </h3>		<p>    TOWARD A RATIONAL USE OF POWER PHOTO: STERLING STOLL</p>            <p>      <em>Anyone who's ever read much Greek mythology is probably      familiar with the legend</em> <em>of</em> <em>Daedalus, who      flew from captivity in Crete on self-wrought wings with his      son Icarus ...only to lose the boy in the sea when the      youth soared too close to the sun and melted the wax that      held his feathers in place.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Now the fact that this bit</em> <em>of</em>      <em>folklore has been with us for thousands</em>      <em>of</em> <em>years indicates that humankind has long      been taken with the idea of muscle-powered flight ...and,      over the centuries, that vision has been pursued by</em>      scores <em>of inquisitive and adventurous people.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Today's Daedalus-the man who finally brought the      age-old dream to life-goes by the name</em> <em>of</em>      <em>Dr. Paul MacCready, Jr ...and is known to most as the      designer and builder of the pedal-powered</em> Gossamer      Albatross <em>(facing page, top) which carried pilot/motor      Bryan Allen across the English Channel, on June 12, 1979,      to win the coveted Kremer £100,000 Cross-Channel      Competition. Prior to that achievement, MacCready and his      team claimed the</em> original <em>Kremer prize-a      £50,000 award that had stood untouched for 18      years-by flying a human-powered craft over a one-mile      course. And, as if these accomplishments aren't      overwhelming in themselves, the California designer was      also responsible for the construction</em> <em>of</em>      <em>the first airplane to</em> <em>fly</em> <em>solely on      sunlight-through the use</em> <em>of</em>      <em>photovoltaic cells-and has recently developed a      more sophisticated version</em> <em>of</em> <em>that      aircraft: the</em> Solar Challenger, <em>piloted by, among      others, Janice Brown (above, left and right).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Knowing all this, you may be surprised to learn that      Paul MacCready</em> isn't <em>an aerospace engineer on      sabbatical from Boeing or McDonnell Douglas ...or that, in      fact, he's never had</em> any <em>conventional aircraft      design experience except what he picked up while working      with model airplanes and gliders. In short, Paul has taken      an approach to ultralight aircraft design that disregards      nearly everything normally held "sacred" by those in the      profession. Furthermore, he and his team have been able to      implement their designs with a minimum</em> <em>of</em>      <em>materials and equipment, since they had neither the      time nor the budget to utilize "big time" methods. (For      example, Dr. MacCready employed a crude wing structure      mounted on a Ford van to make flutter tests, as shown above      center.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We think you'll discover (as MOTHER staffer Richard      Freudenberger did while conducting this interview) that      Paul MacCready's way</em> <em>of</em> <em>thinking and      doing can be applied to a great many</em> <em>of</em>      <em>the challenges that face us. In fact, we may find that      it has a place in more and more</em> <em>of</em> <em>what      we do, as our planet's resources slowly dwindle.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> I couldn't help noticing, when I      came to see you this morning, that your place of business      isn't an airplane hangar as I'd half expected. It's      actually a modern, well-equipped office with a sizable      staff. I take it, then, that you try to keep your job and      your experimental aviation work separate?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Actually, they're somewhat      related. In 1971 I founded AeroVironment, Inc., a      diversified firm that currently deals in environmental      studies, alternative energy systems, and energy-related      products. That company is my bread and butter, so to speak.      But <em>some</em> of the work done in our aerosciences      division-especially that concerned with advanced      aerodynamics-goes hand in hand with many aspects of      the Gossamer aircraft projects, since the slow-flying      vehicles require special design considerations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> As I understand it, you received      your bachelor's and master's degrees in physics. At what      point did you become involved with the study of      aeronautics?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> I didn't have any formal      training in that field until I took an aeronautics course      at Cal Tech, while working on my master's ...and found it      much more appealing than my former area of specialization.      To me, physics represents the fundamentals, and I believe      that studying it is an excellent scientific training      regimen ...but I was interested in sailplanes at that time,      too, so it seemed sensible that I expand my area of study      to <em>include</em> aeronautics.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How did you get involved with      sailplanes?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Oh, I've been interested in      flight since I was a boy growing up in New Haven,      Connecticut. I started designing my own model gliders at      the age of 12, and by the time I was 18-just before      Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of the Second World      War-I'd competed in national model airplane      championships, and had also soloed in a conventional      single-engine aircraft. As an undergraduate at Yale, I      enrolled in the U.S. Navy flight training program, and at      the end of the war I had the opportunity to purchase a      surplus training glider, which I taught myself to fly      ...with the help of some good friends from my      model-building days. In the years following-until      about 1958, when I finished my active involvement with      sailplanes- I owned several other craft and competed      regularly in national and international soaring meets.    </p>    <p>      My interest in meteorology helped maintain my fascination      with gliders, too. I remember in the summer of      '45-while living in Pensacola-watching cumulus      clouds turn into thunderstorms and thinking it would be fun      to play around with a sailplane in such complex currents.      Also, I found the gliders to be excellent      research-related devices, because they trigger ideas      about aerodynamic efficiency, airplane modifications, and      ways of working with the weather. They're much more      challenging to handle than are <em>powered</em> aircraft.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> So your gliding took on a      scientific cast and encouraged you to pursue an      aeronautical degree.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Exactly. I originally wanted to      study meteorology, but Cal Tech didn't have a program in      that, so I did my doctoral work in aeronautics. My      dissertation dealt with atmospheric turbulence, and by the      time I obtained the degree, I was very much involved in      weather modification ...which I then took up as a      profession in the early 1950's. I had no special interest      in the aerospace field and its big company atmosphere,      where I suspected one person couldn't make a very relevant      contribution. Furthermore, I wasn't enthusiastic about      limiting my work to classified military projects.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How did your career in      meteorology lead you into the development of human-powered      aircraft?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Actually, my entering that      field of research was the result of a whole <em>series</em>      of events. To begin with, I resigned from Meteorology      Research, Inc. in 1970, feeling in need of a change, and      after forming a partnership with a relative-I bought      out a small catamaran manufacturing firm. Soon thereafter,      though, I started AeroVironment ...and-while that      corporation prospered-the boat business declined.    </p>    <p>      To make a long story short, we finally had to sell the      "cat" factory, but I was still saddled with a sizable debt      resulting from a loan I had countersigned while we were      trying to keep the jointly owned company afloat. It was      very annoying to have that obligation hanging over my head,      and it occurred to me that the simplest way to pay it off      would be to take a shot at the £ 50,000 Kremer Prize,      which was to be awarded to the first person or group to      make a successful controlled flight of a human-powered      aircraft ...under conditions set by the British Royal      Aeronautical Society. I was sure that I could win the      prize, and figured the 90,000 or so dollars it represented      would just about take care of my debt.    </p><p><strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> But surely your interest was    more than merely financial ...</p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Everyone seems to wish I'd      tackled human-powered flight in some great romantic spirit      for the cause of aviation pioneering, but what I told you      happens to be the truth. I had to make a sound business      decision: On one hand, most people wouldn't consider      building a human-powered aircraft to be a realistic way to      try to earn money, but on the other, I believed there was a      darned good chance that the project would take just a      little work and consume only a few hours on evenings and      weekends ...requiring quite a small investment for a very      handsome return.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the whole thing turned out to be much more      demanding than I'd hoped, but it also turned out to be much      more <em>fun</em> than I'd imagined! My family got involved      wholeheartedly, I made new and valuable friends, and I came      to enjoy solving the problems we encountered along the way.      In fact, I felt so positive about the project that-in      the midst of it-I began to wonder whether, if the      prize had suddenly been withdrawn, we would have continued      anyway. I have a feeling we would have.    </p>    <p>      Speaking from experience, though, the economic aspects of      any experimental endeavor simply can't be ignored. There      are many good ideas around, and good people who are willing      to work to implement them ...but unless there's an existing      economic framework to make funding possible, a research      project simply can't survive. Realistically, the technical      portions of our initial human-powered flight effort      accounted for perhaps only 10% of the job ...the remaining      90% was all a matter of business.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What about the people you work      with? Does it take a special breed to tackle the challenges      posed by experimental aviation work?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Our circumstances are very      unusual, and the number of staffers that we can assimilate      each year is next to zero. You see, we have to have very      competent workers ...but may need them for only two weeks      or two months. Therefore, we can't often use solid citizens      who have full-time jobs, spouses, and children ...instead,      we employ hang-glider guys who are well qualified, but are      sort of living on the fringes of society. They're mostly      unmarried and are available at short notice. Of course, we      do have a few establishment types who take on some      responsibilities-but can't devote a whole lot of time      to the projects-plus a couple of retired people who      spend a good deal of time on the job.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> The development of the Gossamer      <em>Condor was</em> the first task that your loosely knit      team tackled, wasn't it?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Yes, the <em>Condor</em> was      our initial success ...it was a pedal-driven machine, and      Bryan Allen piloted it around a mile-long figure-eight      course at Shafter Airport here in California, to win the      Kremer £50,000 Competition, in August of 1977. Then,      in October 1978, the Royal Aeronautical Society officially      announced the establishment of a <em>new contest the</em>      Kremer of £100,000 Cross-Channel Competition-to      provide incentive for a human-powered flight between      England and France. We decided to go after that award, too,      and built the Gossamer Albatross, with sponsorship from Du      Pont. Bryan completed the cross-channel flight in June of      1979.    </p>    <p>      In order to have backup aircraft for the event, we      constructed two additional units: the Gossamer Albatross      II, which was later selected for use in NASA's low-speed      flight research program, and the Gossamer      <em>Penguin-essentially a</em> 3/4-scale version of the      Albatross-which we converted to electric drive early      in 1980 and powered solely with photovoltaic cells later in      the year. My youngest son, Marshall, performed the initial      sun-power tests, and then we made a two-mile record flight      -with Janice Brown as pilot-on August 7, 1980.      Our newest craft is the Solar <em>Challenger ...a</em>      lightweight, comparatively rugged airplane which is capable      of flying safely at high altitudes and derives all its      power from solar cells mounted on the upper surface of its      wings and horizontal rear stabilizer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> You mentioned your Du Pont      sponsorship ...don't you find it ironic that you had to      rely on big business to achieve what's widely regarded as a      "little guy's" triumph?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> No, that's not how I see it at      all, and for two reasons. First, we built the Albatross      before we ever got involved with Du Pont ...but we were      using a lot of that company's materials. That's why we went      to the people there for sponsorship in the first place.      They, in turn, saw our project as a good showcase for some      of their products. It demonstrated that the modern Du Pont      materials were very light and strong ...attributes which      will make them valuable in undertakings that might have      more practical applications than do human or solar-powered      airplanes. But our craft are just different enough to be      interesting and exciting, and the materials used in them      are much more likely to get publicity than would the same      substances transformed into, say, tops for garbage cans!    </p>    <p>      In the second place, the corporate sponsorship put our      projects on the map, so to speak. The Du Pont people worked      up press kits, made announcements, scheduled conferences,      and generally assured us well-observed events. And, of      course, that publicity has attracted attention to a number      of worthwhile projects. In the case of the solar-powered      airplanes in particular, we've been able to demonstrate      dramatically that photovoltaic cells do work ...and it's my      hope that our efforts may help promote the ongoing attempts      to reduce their cost over the next few years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> So you really don't see any      direct practical use for the aircraft you've developed      ...not even as short-hop commuting planes to be used in      uncongested areas?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Let's put it this way: Flying a      human-powered airplane was like climbing Mount Everest      ...it represented a challenge that's captivated humankind      for centuries. But it wouldn't make sense to build a hotel      up on top of the world's tallest peak and call it a      business, and it's the same with the plane. We may actually      have put roadblocks in the way of the development of a      commercial human-powered airplane, because we've taken all      the significant prizes, and-while doing so-have      demonstrated that the vehicle capable of accomplishing the      feat is so delicate that it really can't be marketed.    </p>    <p>      The same goes for the Challenger. It's a symbol. The      solar-powered craft is a dreadful airplane. We had to make      so many compromises to permit it to fly on photovoltaic      cells that it's really just an ugly duckling. Of course,      it's more rugged than the Albatross, and it can fly through      the turbulence that's encountered at higher altitudes. But,      in order to enable it to operate on solar power, we had to      use a very wide wing and a huge stabilizer-to allow      adequate surface for the cells-and a gigantic      propeller. All of that made for a very peculiar structure      that flies slowly and isn't easy to control ...hence the      need for a skilled and lightweight pilot like Janice Brown.      No, I doubt that even one ten-thousandth of a percent of      the solar cells being used ten years from now will be      powering airplanes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Then you do believe that      photovoltaic panels can be put to more practical use in      other areas?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Oh, most definitely. The      biggest obstacle to their widespread acceptance is cost. At      $10 a watt, or whatever the price is now, they're not      really affordable ...but the goal set for the Department of      Energy's so-called Solar Ray project was 772 a watt by      1986, figured in 1980 dollars. From what I understand,      progress is being made ...the breakthroughs are there, the      cost of raw materials and production is decreasing,      and-on the whole-the field is in pretty good      shape. Now that doesn't mean all the obstacles have been      overcome ...it just indicates that the industry is working      toward achieving what it has set out to do. In fact, some      of the corporations that were involved with the program      from the beginning are now putting a lot of their own money      into it and not <em>sharing</em> their data. I take that to      mean they're really onto something. It's a very good sign.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> You mentioned the figure of 772 a      watt. If I'm not mistaken, that's less expensive than most      present utility rates. Do you think the photovoltaic cell      may provide the answer to our energy problems?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> No, we shouldn't make the      mistake of viewing solar electricity as a panacea. However,      we do know that the cost of petroleum-based energy can only      go up as supplies dwindle ...and photovoltaic power is the      one alternative I know of that is assuredly going to be      inexpensive, by comparison, within the next five or six      years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Do you think the day will come      when many people will-as some do today-have      rooftop photovoltaic arrays that'll allow them to produce      their own electricity on an individual basis?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> I'm not convinced of the      practicality of the notion that each person should become      his or her own little utility company.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Are you, then, in favor of      community-scale solar power plants?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Yes, I am. Utility systems were      formed, in the first place, to enable power to be generated      centrally and efficiently and transmitted to the public      through a standardized grid. If I set out to avoid the use      of fossil fuels, I'd prefer to have a solar power plant      located in a desert region, where there's plenty of sun,      rather than to rely on my own often cloudy area's      intermittent sunlight to supply my household.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> So you'd agree that there's a      happy medium somewhere between a huge power monopoly and a      perhaps inefficient, small-scale, individual      energy-generating plant. But don't you recognize the fear      that a utility of even modest size might tend to get, well      ...overbearing, especially if it's the only source of      available energy in an area?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> There's always the danger that      its customers will become overly dependent upon the      utility, but that would be their own fault. If we all      actively practiced energy conservation and didn't live      lifestyles that are literally sustained by the power      companies, we couldn't be manipulated by the fear of having      to get along with limited or no-electrical service for      short periods.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> You sound like an advocate of      self-discipline.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Yes, if that's what you want to      call it. I'm sure you realize that this whole energy crisis      we're going through involves much more than just the cost      of oil. Part of the problem is that our society has come to      expect instant gratification. It's no wonder that the      average citizen expects a quick fix to the high price of      gasoline, without giving a thought to why the fuel is      becoming more expensive in the first place.    </p>    <p>      I'm convinced that the real price of      gasoline-including the cost of locating and      unearthing it, processing it, and transporting it ...the      expense of maintaining a military presence to insure our      continued access to foreign supplies ...and that of making      investments in developing replacements for the      future-is probably closer to $10 a gallon than to the      $1.40 or so we're paying for it now.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, our energy dependence is costing us in other      ways ...you might almost say we're spending our nation's      future. And America's world position is now dominated by      what goes on in the Middle East, with our foreign policy      pretty much made up of what we have to do to respond to      real or imagined threats. We've come to the point where an      oil-rich sheik has more power than any U.S.      senator-and perhaps even more than the      President-to affect our national attitude toward one      country or another with regard to the sale of weapons, the      sharing of technology, and so forth. We'll never be masters      of our own destiny as long as we're hooked on this fuel we      burn. If we were producing all the energy we need, our      foreign policy could be based on logic rather than fear. We      could work with these other nations, and perhaps do good      things with them, in a sensible manner.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> I'm sure there aren't any simple      answers, but in which course of action do you think the      solutions lie?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> We have to start by readjusting      our way of thinking, and that will require some bold      initiative on the part of those who have influence. I have      a strong feeling that corporations, individuals, and      organizations like your magazine, for example, can be much      more effective if they're not dependent upon government      ...since politics has a way of tying the hands of those it      "helps". Even Carter-who, I think, made a sincere      effort to put a healthy tax on gasoline so we wouldn't      squander it couldn't accomplish his goal because of the      pressure he was under.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Then you feel that raising the      price of fuel would be an acceptable way for us-in      effect-to force ourselves to develop alternatives      while saving our resources?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Yes, I do, although it wouldn't      be easy to arrive at a cost that would encourage      conservation without causing too much suffering. But could      you imagine the fantastic cut in petroleum use we'd see if      everyone were paying $10 a gallon? And, regardless of how      it comes about, both short- and longterm energy      conservation should be among our top national priorities,      right along with the development of reliable petroleum      substitutes. Unfortunately, right now conservation isn't as      good a business as is consumption.    </p>        <p>      Colorado aviator Stephen Ptacek got MacCready's go-ahead t      pilot the solar challenger for the France-to-England      flight.    </p>    <p>      However, we must get accustomed to the fact that energy      doesn't come-and never should have come-cheap.      Do you realize that gasoline is still so inexpensive in      this country that a new car operated over three years      costs-including depreciation, interest payments,      insurance, maintenance, fuel, and so forth-about 38      to 50 cents a mile ...and that only 12% of that is spent on      gasoline? We're paying a much lower fuel cost per mile of      driving than people in Europe paid 25 or 50 years ago!      Energy is very inexpensive in the U.S., and as a result      we're devouring the earth's fossil fuel      resources-which we can financially afford to      do-in great amounts, and making petroleum products      terribly expensive for the rest of the world.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> And for future generations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Oh, your grandchildren will      likely find it <em>incredi</em> ble-or even      sinful-that you burned up a gallon of gasoline to      fetch a pack of cigarettes! Nonetheless, we still go on      believing that, miraculously, things will get better. In      fact, there's a chance that-with the glut of fuel on      the market right now gasoline prices might be cut slightly      ...which will probably prompt many people to go out and buy      bigger cars, because that's what Madison Avenue has told      them is macho. And that sort of reaction eventually results      in a needless waste of petroleum and still <em>higher      prices</em> at the pumps.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Do you think the higher prices      reflect the oil industry's desire to make an unreasonable      profit?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> I've had several people      question me on that, as well as on the possibility that Big      Oil is buying out the manufacturers of solar cells in order      to stifle any competition. However, I think that the      petroleum industry is doing just what you or I would do if      we owned a business dealing in a dwindling and      unreplenishable resource and had money to invest: We'd be      looking for alternatives. Such firms have bought out      virtually all the major solar cell companies and are      pouring tens of millions of dollars into them. They      certainly wouldn't be spending that kind of money on a      technology that they were trying to suppress.    </p>    <p>      I'm afraid that a good deal of this mistrust of industry is      the result of yellow journalism on the part of some      popular-and irresponsible tabloid publications. Such      newspapers <em>know</em> that a lot of their articles are      out-and-out frauds, but they also know what the      public will buy. Unfortunately, each unfounded article      erodes a little more of the mind of whoever digests it      ...and those same readers must help decide whom to elect,      whether nuclear power should be used, and other very subtle      and difficult questions. It's too bad we can't figure out      some way to bring a class action suit against the      publishers of sensationalist newsstand rags for literally      damaging the thinking ability of millions of people!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> All right, you've told us how you      view our energy problems and proposed some ways in which we      might be able to deal with them. But how do you expect an      average American to cope with $10-a-gallon gasoline      when he or she might not <em>now</em> be able to afford a      balanced meal every night of the week? Surely you've got to      consider the fact that our society must continue to      function-without, if possible, causing widespread      suffering-in the midst of any changes that must be      made.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Exactly ...and that's why it's      important that we take our search for alternatives      seriously, so we won't be caught short if an emergency      situation should arise. Whether the solution lies in      developing a practical fuel or in building a new generation      of automobiles, we should be working toward it      <em>now,</em> not after the fact.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Do you think that the auto      industry is making a concerted effort toward developing      practical high-mileage vehicles?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Oh, without a doubt. I'm very      optimistic about the next ten years in the automotive      industry. Its engineers and designers are really focusing      on doing some very good things, such as using new      lightweight materials. Of course, the changes don't happen      overnight. If a firm wanted, for example, to make a hood      from one of the newer composite materials, it would take      many millions of dollars of research and development money      to decide what to do, how to do it, how well the material      would endure, and whether the change would really be more      economical over the long term than the sheet-metal method      it's replacing. And then there's always the chance that the      public won't accept a new idea, regardless of how efficient      or inexpensive it is, because it's not what people are used      to ...in which case the company could go under for lack of      sales. That particular sword-of-Damocles threat is a sure      impediment to creativity and innovation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> I imagine, though, that it'd be      pretty difficult to come up with an alternative method of      bringing about change ...after all, Detroit's been going at      it in the plodding fashion you describe-for the most      part successfully-for 80 years!    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Yes, but I don't think the      world is going to let us <em>make</em> the kind of slow,      well-researched decisions we've made in the past. We can no      longer afford to spend years between the conception of a      new development and its appearance. We might better put our      resources and efforts toward vehicles that are more      versatile, more modular, and maybe even more expensive at      first ...but that wouldn't take all that long to adapt to      suit changing circumstances.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> And how might that sort of      breakthrough come about?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Again, we'd have to start by      reorienting our method of thinking. The May issue of      <em>Scientific American</em> contains an excellent article      on cars of the future and what sorts of changes will be      required to bring the Corporate Average Fuel Economy up to      the 80-mile-per-gallon figure. But even that piece assumes      that we'll work with an established element and try to      coax, push, and develop it into something better. However,      there's an opposing school of thought that's downright      foreign to the evolutionary way of designing things, and      <em>its</em> premise-in this case-can be based      on one question: What is the <em>minimum</em> that's really      required to move someone from here to there? By focusing on      a clearly defined <em>goal,</em> a designer tends to get      less tied up with peripheral matters or extrapolation from      a known element, all of which can obscure the most direct      path toward the objective.    </p>    <p>      I'll relate a little anecdote that illustrates this point      very well. I was talking with my ten-year-old son about the      idea of putting a needle on water and having it float,      supported by the liquid's surface tension. Now a very tiny      needle is easy to float, but I asked him how to put the      <em>biggest</em> possible needle down and still have it      float. I was really hoping he'd come up with a way in which      it could be lowered without disturbing the integrity of the      liquid's uppermost layer.    </p>    <p>      My son's answer was refreshing: Freeze the water, place the      needle on it, then let the ice melt. Now whether it would      work or not isn't the issue here. The point is that I would      never have thought of that, because in my youth I'd been      conditioned to focus on the idea of <em>physically</em>      setting the needle down when performing the experiment.      This youngster, though, had never seen the trick done, so      he was starting with a clean slate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> And you believe that sort of      unprejudiced thinking could be applied-to good      effect-by automotive designers?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> I don't see why not, though      admittedly it'd be difficult to change such a      well-established industry in a short period of time. And      there'd be a lot of public relations work required to      overcome negative consumer reaction to a vehicle that would      necessarily be radically different from what we're used to.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What other alternatives do you      see ...is it possible that the car of the future      <em>won't</em> be developed by one of the Detroit      juggernauts, but by a whole new enterprise?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> That's an interesting question.      I'm personally involved in this area, you see, because I      happen to be co-president of the International      Human-Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA), an organization      that sponsors annual races here in Los Angeles. Nearly      everyone who's worked on our aircraft has also spent some      time on the research and development of <em>these</em>      pedaled devices, and I find the field extremely exciting      and very promising. It's difficult to say where it might      lead, though the transportation industry is definitely      taking a good look at what we're doing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Do the bikes have that much in      common with cars?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> I'm not talking about typical      bicycles. Human powered vehicles are built in many      <em>different</em> configurations. Some have four wheels,      some three or two. Many are bicycle frames with fairings,      but the more radical ones use custom built alloy frames      with fiberglass or mylar coverings, or composite bodies      that have integral strength characteristics. They can carry      one or several riders in a variety of positions, depending      upon the design of the machine, and their low weight and      highly aerodynamic shape means that they'll move down the      road at 30 miles per hour with a human input of only about      1/4 horsepower. Some of the fastest ones can easily break      the legal speed limit.    </p>    <p>      Now the HPV's that win the races are, of course, not ideal      street vehicles because they're too fast and offer a      minimum of protection and visibility ...but I'm sure it's      possible to design a good vehicle, halfway between a bike      and a small car, that would be suitable for commuting at      speeds of 35 miles per hour or less. It would be very      inexpensive ...and much safer than a bicycle or a moped      because it would enclose the driver in a protective pocket      with a roll bar and side guards.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Do you have any plans for      developing a road vehicle program that might parallel your      aircraft efforts?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Well, right now I'm spending      some time studying HPV's, talking to a lot of people, and      drawing up possible configurations. As I said, my personal      interest-besides seeing the sport grow-is in      the development of practical, street-usable vehicles. I see      the IHPVA competition as much more than just a bunch of      people out for the challenge of racing. The world can't      afford, any longer, to use so much of its mineral resources      and fossil fuels to provide transportation. We've got to      find a way to do the same job with a lot less material and      energy ...and the human-powered vehicles help show what      <em>can</em> be done, just as our airplane experiments have      demonstrated the potential of focusing on the      <em>efficient</em> use of power.    </p>    <p>      I'd like to see a mass-produced vehicle developed that      retails at around $500-which is about the same price      as a good racing bike-and permits people to handle      all their ordinary commuting and shopping tasks except      those requiring freeway driving. Are you aware that nearly      75% of all car trips involve distances of less than ten      miles? Imagine the fuel we'd save if such vehicles could      handle all of <em>that</em> travel!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> But wouldn't HPV's be limited by      terrain?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Not necessarily. You see, these      vehicles could easily use a small auxiliary gasoline or      electric motor without making much of an impact on our      energy supplies. Not only would the machine be capable of      perhaps 500 miles per gallon, but it might use only 50 or      75 pounds of material, since that's really the minimum      required to move a person, safely and comfortably, down a      hard-surfaced road in low to moderate winds at the speeds      we're talking about. And mass production is a key factor,      too, because it saves money and cuts waste to a minimum.      Cars are sold now at a little over $2.00 a pound ...up from      the $1.00 a pound they used to be. So if the HPV weighs 50      pounds and sells for $500, it should certainly be      profitable to mass-produce ...using the kind of space-age      technology that Detroit currently applies to the assembly      of automobiles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How practical do you think the      vehicles would really be on today's roads?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Oh, there's a lot of negativism      to overcome in doing something like this. The      transportation system we grew up with has developed over      the last 80 or 100 years. It involves certain kinds of      roads, certain distances between home and work, certain      parameters for car design, and even special procedures for      obtaining drivers' licenses ...so when you try to inject      something foreign into the system, it doesn't fit very      well. However, if the HPV's were first introduced into an      area where they likely <em>would</em> be      accepted-perhaps a community such as Davis,      California, where bicycles are already used on a large      scale for transportation-they'd be assimilated more      easily. It's just a matter of gaining public acceptance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> All right, at this point you're      involved in the humanpowered vehicle movement, but you      haven't begun any serious prototype construction efforts.      What projects <em>are you</em> currently undertaking? Your      alternative aviation triumphs are going to be tough acts to      follow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> Well, we're planning a      Paris-to-London flight with the <em>Solar Challenger,</em>      which I'm sure you're aware of. By the time this interview      goes to press, it will have-we hope -already      occurred. We're using a new, more powerful motor      system-and flying in the summer-so the results      should be better than those logged during previous flights.      The total distance is between 160 and 220      miles-depending on our route-and 22 of those      will be over water, so we plan to maintain an altitude of      about 14,000 feet in order to allow a 33-mile glide path      should mechanical difficulties arise. It's all a great      logistics headache, frankly, and we want to do it in as      simple a manner as we can ...because, even though it's a      huge project, it <em>doesn't</em> have a large budget.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> One final question: Have you ever      considered why you've been so successful in both human- and      solar-powered flight when others haven't? Can you chalk it      up to talent, determination, hard work, luck ...or any      combination of those?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MACCREADY:</strong> First and foremost, I had a      clear goal ...I knew what my motives were, and I didn't      merely extrapolate from a previous position in an attempt      to arrive at an answer. Looking back, I can see what a      benefit it was to me that I never had any conventional      aircraft structural design experience. Every other serious      team did, and they all made craft that looked pretty much      like standard airplanes except that they were lighter and      less complex. I'm beginning to find a lot more that's      admirable in the airplane projects than I thought at first,      simply because they reinforced my thought process ...they      taught me to name a goal from the outset, and then to      ignore any and all notions that weren't directly concerned      with the job at hand.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: On July 7, 1981 Dr. MacCready's</em>      Solar Challenger piloted <em>by Stephen Ptacek-did      indeed accomplish the hoped-for English Channel      crossing ...covering the 230 miles (actual flight distance)      from Cormeilles-en-Vexin, France to Manston, England in 5      hours and 23 minutes and achieving a maximum speed of 47      MPH.
