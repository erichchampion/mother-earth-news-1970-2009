                 		<p>THE CONTENTED WORKAHOLIC</p>    <h5 id="byline">by      Dr. Tom Ferguson    </h5>         <p>      After her freshman year at college, Marilyn Machlowitz      returned home to take on not one, not two, but      <em>three</em> summer jobs.    </p>    <p>      "You know what you are?" her father commented. "A      workaholic."    </p>    <p>      That was the first time Marilyn heard the term ...but it      wasn't to be the last. She went on to do her doctoral      dissertation on the subject and, subsequently, to write a      book called <em>Workaholics: Living With Them, Working With      Then.</em> (Addison-Wesley, 1980).    </p>    <p>      One of the first surprises turned up by Ms. Machlowitz's      research was the discovery that, as a group, the      workaholics she interviewed were "remarkably satisfied with      their lives". Indeed, according to one study cited in the      book, 70% of those who rated their job satisfaction as      "good" were equally happy with the <em>rest</em> of their      lives ...while only 14% of those unhappy with their work      felt more pleased when off the job. "Satisfactions with      work and with life," Machlowitz concludes, "are more apt to      be intertwined than mutually exclusive."    </p>    <p>      According to Machlowitz, four basic elements in      workaholics' lives determine whether the individuals are      contented or unhappy: [1] the manner in which their      families accept their work habits, [2] the amount of      autonomy and variety that exists in their work, [3] the      degree to which their personal skills and work styles match      those required by their jobs, and [4) their general state      of health.    </p>    <p>      The workaholics who were satisfied with these four aspects      of their lives generally felt good about themselves as      well. But those who'd had difficulties with one or more      elements were risking what might be termed the three      occupational hazards of the intensely self-driven worker      ...burnout, family problems, and heart disease.    </p>    <p>      FROM BROWNOUT TO BURNOUT    </p>    <p>      Psychologist Herbert J. Freudenberger is a specialist in      burnout. He calls it "the consequence of a work situation      where the person feels he's banging his head against the      wall day after day, year after year". Burnout is likely to      occur when nonstop labor and devotion fail to produce the      expected satisfactions or rewards.    </p>    <p>      A full-fledged burnout resembles the condition      traditionally known as a nervous breakdown. However, for a      lot of workaholics the emotional damage falls short of      total burnout, even though they may from time to      time-or even quite frequently-experience the      <em>early</em> stages of this problem. Medical      anthropologist John-Henry Pfifferling has adopted the term      "brownout" to describe this type of low-level exhaustion.      (See the sidebar, "Brownout/Burnout Inventory", to      determine whether <em>you're</em> risking one of these      occupational hazards.)    </p>    <p>      FAMILIES PAY THE PRICE    </p>    <p>      One of the most striking findings of Marilyn Machlowitz's      study was that, on a day-to-day basis, it's not the      workaholics who pay the biggest price for their busy      lifestyles ...rather, it's the <em>people who live with      them,</em> who suffer most. Because the dedicated doers      love their jobs so much, they tend to spend less time at      home than most people. As a consequence, their families      often feel that the workaholics don't <em>want</em> to be      with the folks at home.    </p>    <p>      Machlowitz offers some constructive suggestions for      families of labor addicts:    </p>    <p>      Write yourself into the workaholic's appointment calendar      to take advantage of his or her tendency to schedule      everything. (Make dates for breakfast as well as lunch and      dinner.)    </p>    <p>      Arrange social plans that are difficult to cancel ...for      example, buy a season ticket for a theater, symphony, or      sports series. (And try to negotiate an agreement that, if      your hard worker <em>breaks</em> such a date, he or she      must pay some previously set penalty.}    </p>    <p>      Insist on vacations, plan them well in advance, and ask for      a predetermined limit to the number of phone calls the      workaholic can make to his or her place of business ...or      better yet-travel to a spot with no telephone access at ail    </p>    <p>      IT WORKS BOTH WAYS    </p>    <p>      In the same vein, workaholics need to realize that their      families may sometimes feel as though they play second      fiddle to the person's job. So, in addition to limiting the      time spent on work, an eager laborer should do everything      possible to familiarize the rest of the family with his or      her employment world. Small children might be encouraged to      visit the workplace on weekends. Older offspring might even      enjoy spending some time at the job "helping out".    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, chronic workers should be sure to show      interest and concern in domestic affairs by pitching in      when they <em>are</em> at home. They should take an active      part in housework ...without having to be asked (or      expecting any medals for doing their fair share).      Workaholics can demonstrate that families count by      arranging to spend time doing some of the things those      loved ones enjoy. Who knows? The hard worker may like the      new experience of accompanying his or her spouse to the      opera ...or surprising a soccer-crazy daughter by dropping      in on some of her practices, as well as showing up at her      big game.    </p>    <p>      HEART DISEASE    </p>    <p>      Being a workaholic may or may not increase a person's risk      of contracting coronary heart disease. According to      cardiologists Meyer Friedman and Ray Rosenman, much depends      on whether the individual is a "Type A" or "Type B"      personality. The hallmarks of the former class are      excessive competitive drive and intense time urgency      ...characteristics common to the <em>problem</em>      workaholic. Type B individuals, on the other hand, may also      be hardworking, but are more easygoing ...they exhibit no      excessive competitiveness or overwhelming sense of time      pressure.    </p>    <p>      Friedman and Rosenman accumulated an impressive body of      evidence indicating that Type A people are as much as      <em>seven times</em> more likely to develop coronary heart      disease as are their Type B counterparts. To reduce their      disease risk, compulsively self-driven individuals should      learn to slow down and enjoy life. The cardiologists      recommend such exercises as sitting and doing nothing      ...establishing (or reestablishing) connections with art,      nature, friends, family, and tradition ...and-in      general-savoring life rather than racing through it.    </p>    <p>      Vacations can also provide workaholics with valuable      opportunities to gain perspective on their lives and      realize how much of their so-called leisure time is      actually spent working ...although many problem workaholics      find it difficult to let themselves be "lazy" enough to      take-or enjoy-a holiday. To cite one such      instance, reformed workaholic Michael Phillips was able to      make a decision to reshape his life and leave his      high-pressure career as a banking executive only after an      understanding friend sent him away on a cruise ship.    </p>    <p>      "I'd never been able to sit still," Phillips recalls. "Once      I was on board that ship and realized that there was      literally nothing to do, I just about had a nervous      breakdown. I even tried to get a helicopter to come pick me      up. Finally, I was faced with a choice between cracking up      and simply sitting in a deck chair and watching the ocean      for several days." That enforced leisure gave Phillips the      opportunity to think through his life and undertake some      constructive changes.    </p>    <p>      LUCKY WORKAHOLICS    </p>    <p>      In many ways, satisfied workaholics are lucky people. Not      only do they tend to love their careers, but the "cure" for      their characteristic problems which involves learning to      relax, take vacations, and spend more quality time with      their families and friends-can be rich with      opportunity as well. Those workaholics who are able to make      needed changes in their lives <em>before</em> serious      physical or emotional problems arise can quietly agree with      Winston Churchill's observation: "Those whose work and      pleasure are one are Fortune's favorite children."    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Tom Ferguson's quarterly journal, Medical      Self-Care, is available for $15 per year from Medical      Self-Care, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 717, Inverness, California      94937. A sample issue (No. 1,1, by the way, was devoted      entirely to health on the job) costs .1;4.00. Dr.      Ferguson's book, also titled Medical SelfCare, is available      from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.

Consider your workplace . . your family . . and      the social situations you've encountered. Have you been      noticing changes for the worse in yourself or in the world      around you? Allow about 30 seconds to think over each      question. To answer it, assign a number from 1 (for little      or no change) to 5 (for a great deal of change).    </p>    <p>      [1] Do you tire more easily than before and feel fatigued      rather than energetic?    </p>    <p>      [2] Are people annoying you more often by telling you, "You      don't look so good lately"?    </p>    <p>      [3] Are you working harder and harder but accomplishing      less and less?    </p>    <p>      (4] Are you increasingly cynics and disenchanted?    </p>    <p>      [5] Are you more often invaded by a sadness you're not able      to explain?    </p>    <p>      [6] Do you consistently find yourself forgetting more      appointments, deadlines, and/or personal possessions?    </p>    <p>      [7] Are you increasingly irritable ...more short-tempered      ... more disappointed in the people around you?    </p>    <p>      [8] Are you seeing your close friends and family members      less frequently?    </p>    <p>      [9] Are you so busy that you do even routine      things-like making phone calls, reading reports, or      sending Christmas cardsless and less?    </p>    <p>      [10] Are you suffering more physical complaints ...such as      aches, pains, headaches, or lingering colds?    </p>    <p>      [11] Do you feel more disoriented than you used to when the      activity of a day comes to a halt?    </p>    <p>      [12] Is joy more elusive?    </p>    <p>      [13] Are you less able to laugh at a joke about yourself?    </p>    <p>      [14] Does sex more frequently seem like more trouble than      it's worth?    </p>    <p>      [15] Do you have less to say to people?    </p>    <p>      Don't let a high total score on your answers alarm you, but      <em>do</em> pay attention to it. Burnout isn't      irreversible, no matter how far along it is, but remember:      A high number signifies that you ought to start being      kinder to yourself ...and the sooner you do so, the better      your-and your family's life will likely be.    </p>    <p>      15-25 You're doing fine. 26-35 There are things you should      be watching. 36-50 You are in a state of brownout. 51-65      You are burning out. over 65 You're in a dangerous state      that's threatening to your physical and mental well being.    </p>    <p>      (adapted by permission from Burn Out: The Melancholia of      High Achievement by Herbert J.
