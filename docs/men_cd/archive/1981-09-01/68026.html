                 <p>      You don't need your own woodlot to start this thriving      part-time business.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by      David Markson    </h5>    <p>      Photos Supplied By The Author    </p>        <p>      Last fall and winter, I cut enough firewood to heat my      seven-room house <em>and</em> bring in a substantial profit      ...even though my home is in the heart of suburban New      Jersey, only 30 minutes from midtown Manhattan! And if you      live in or near a large city, as I do, you might also be      able to keep your woodpile highwhile earning a steady      income-by cashing in on readily available      <em>free</em> fuel.    </p>    <p>      Just about every country dweller realizes the value of good      cordwood, you see, but in the cities and suburbs great      quantities of this valuable natural fuel go to waste every      year. Scrap wood from urban building projects is just as      often discarded as it is recycled, and streets in many      older residential neighborhoods are lined with massive oaks      and maples that are regularly trimmed. So anyone with a      little free time, a few tools, and some elementary      knowledge of woodcutting can help him- or herself to      a bonanza of free-for-the-hauling firewood.    </p>    <p>      OPEN FOR BUSINESS    </p>    <p>      I launched my career as an urban lumberjack when Hurricane      David's violent winds littered the streets of my New Jersey      town with enough tree trunks and limbs to fuel a whole      <em>battalion</em> of stoves.    </p>    <p>      As I watched the city's cleanup crews feeding cord after      cord of perfectly good wood into the steel jaws of chipping      machines, I had a brainstorm: Who would object if I were to      reach some of the fallen timber <em>before</em> the      municipal workers did, and cut the logs to cart home for my      fireplace? I set to it right away, and within a couple of      afternoons-using only a bucksaw and a compact      car- I collected nearly <em>two cords</em> of wood!    </p>    <p>      After that encouraging start, my project quickly mushroomed      into a small but steady business, which brought in over      $1,000 last year (not including the cash I saved by      reducing my own heating bills). I've discovered numerous      sources of free wood to supply my own fireplace and stove      ...I now have a long list of customers to whom I can sell      the surplus ...and my profits have enabled me to buy a      chain saw, a used pickup truck, and a new airtight      woodstove.    </p>    <p>      I'm willing to bet that you could easily duplicate my      success ...whether you plan to cut wood just for your      personal needs, or to harvest enough to start a full-scale      delivery service. However, although urban lumberjacking is      relatively easy to break into, it <em>isn't</em> an ideal      line of work for everyone. The initial investment in      equipment doesn't have to be large ...but you will have to      spend many hours cutting, splitting, and stacking wood. If      you're not prepared to make that kind of commitment, you'd      better plan to pay for having your fuel delivered to your      doorstep this winter. On the other hand, if the idea of      being your own boss and working up a good honest sweat with      vigorous outdoor work <em>does</em> appeal to you, then      read on ...and good luck!    </p>    <p>      WHERETO FIND FREE WOOD    </p>    <p>      As you begin to collect stock for your business, you'll      probably gain a new understanding of the term "windfall"      ...since your main source of scrounged wood will be trees      and limbs that have been blown down. In fact, you can      sometimes gather a whole year's inventory after just one      major storm. City maintenance teams usually clear the      streets of broken limbs within one or two days after the      skies clear, though, so you'll have to move quickly. To      save time, simply saw fallen trunks and large branches into      the longest pieces you can fit into your vehicle ...then      drop them off at home before heading back to the streets      for another load. (Later on, of course, you can cut and      split the large logs into fireplace and stove lengths.)    </p>    <p>      Ice storms often provide almost as much wood as heavy winds      do. The winter tempests generally dislodge <em>smaller</em>      branches than do hurricanes or tornadoes, but you can      always use more kindling ...and remember, it's all free, so      don't be too choosy!    </p>    <p>      Do be careful, however, about what <em>kind</em> of wood      ,you take home. Sometimes you'll come across a tree or a      limb that's fallen during calm weather, for no apparent      reason. Examine such specimens carefully, because they may      be infested with wood-eating insects. On the other hand,      many deadfalls are perfectly good, and it's wise to explore      new neighborhoods every once in a while-or simply to      vary the route you take to work-in order to keep an      eye out for such "gifts".    </p>    <p>      Believe it or not, homeowners will at times actually assist      your wood-gathering efforts by stacking fallen or pruned      branches at the curb. Of course, the leavings will only be      carted off by the city sanitation department if you don't      haul them away, so take advantage of the situation. Simply      knock on the door. and ask the resident's permission to      remove some of the timber he or she has left at the curb.      Most of the time you'll receive an affirmative answer      ...but if a homeowner hesitates, you might offer to chop up      some fireplace lengths in exchange for the rest of the      load.    </p>    <p>      It's even possible to find <em>finished lumber</em> that's      been thrown away! For example, a builder who recently      cleared a large wooded lot in my neighborhood provided a      double bonanza. First, he left all of the logs      (conveniently sawed into perfect fireplace lengths) for      scavengers like me. Then later when the house construction      was finished-I was able to collect hundreds of broken      2 X 4's and other odd-sized boards, which I split into      piles of kindling.    </p>    <p>      When there hasn't been a storm for months and all your      other usual sources of free wood are exhausted, pay a visit      to the town or county landfill. Either one might be your      <em>best</em> source of up-for grabs fuel      ...provided, of course, that dump scavenging is legal in      your area. Logs that are too big for the city's chipping      machines are routinely left in such places to rot ...and      the huge timbers often measure over two feet in diameter.      However, it's likely to be against regulations to use a      chain saw in the dump, so you'd better take along some      strong friends to help you load the monsters ...then you      can cut the logs to size when you get home.    </p>    <p>      Yet <em>another</em> way to round up fireplace fuel is to      trim unwanted wood from people's yards. You'll usually be      working on small-scale "cases" which most tree surgeons      would charge heavily for, but which <em>can</em> be handled      by anyone with a ladder and a few tools. Of course, you'll      have to be careful not to tackle jobs that really do need a      professional's attention (such as removing an 80-foot oak      that's leaning precariously over a $200,000 residence).      However, a suburban homeowner who wants to get rid of a      15-foot apple tree that's no longer bearing fruit would be      a perfect customer for your cut-it-and-haul-it services.      (And, don't feel any guilt about charging $25 or $30 for      your time and effort, either ...since the pros would likely      charge two to three times that much! )    </p>    <p>      EQUIPPING YOUR BUSINESS    </p>    <p>      If you plan to get into urban woodcutting on a commercial      scale, you'll soon find that you can't function without a      truck and a chain saw. Passenger cars don't usually have      the suspension needed to carry large quantities of wood      safely. Even a van-although it may have ample      room-likely isn't adequately sprung for hauling heavy      loads. Once I had tired of loading the trunk of my compact      car over and over again, I purchased a 3/4ton '69 pickup,      and it's worked very well for transporting logs and      delivering split cordwood. If you're concerned about gas      mileage, you might want to consider buying one of the      smaller-bed trucks ...but remember that you won't be able      to load it with as much wood as a larger model could      handle.    </p>    <p>      The amount and kind of cutting you plan to do will      determine the size and weight of saw that best suits your      needs. For my medium-sized business, I have found a      3.2-horsepower machine with a 16-inch blade to be very      satisfactory. (Be sure to buy a gas fueled model, though,      since the electric units are often underpowered ...and you      can't be bothered with dragging along an extension cord      every place you go.) In addition to a trustworthy saw, your      beginning woodcutter's tool kit should include a six- or      eight-pound maul, a sledge of the same weight, and a couple      of wedges.    </p>    <p>      MARKETING THE SURPLUS    </p>    <p>      Whenever you cut a load of wood, try to split each log into      the smallest pieces practical, to help it season quickly.      Once the wood is processed and stacked, you'll want to let      it "cure" for at least nine months before marketing it.    </p>    <p>      Once it's well seasoned, you should have little trouble      selling your surplus wood, as long as you charge a fair      price and give an honest measure. Of course, it also helps      to undersell the competition by a slight margin. In my      area, a cord of seasoned wood sold for $100 (and up) last      year. I offered my stock at $90 a cord, and I couldn't fill      all of the orders I received as a result of      <em>word-of-mouth advertising</em> around the neighborhood!    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, I supplemented my sub <em>urban</em>      lumberjacking income by selling small loads of wood to      apartment dwellers in Manhattan. Most city folks are used      to paying astronomical prices even for kindling, so I had      no trouble at ail securing orders for my less expensive      bundles (I checked local prices, then cut them by 10 to      20%0) .    </p>    <p>      You might also find that, in addition to being a very      salable item, split wood is a valuable commodity on the      <em>bartering</em> market. Last winter, for example, a      colleague drove me to work every day for several weeks in      exchange for a small load of fireplace logs. Later, a      friend of mine who's an expert plumber repaired my toilet      in return for stovewood.    </p>    <p>      HIRED HANDS    </p>    <p>      On occasion, you may find it necessary to hire a few      part-time helpers to assist with the tasks that are just      too big for one person to handle. I occasionally employ a      couple of strong high school students to lift heavy logs      and to carry wood long distances. The young people work      happily for the minimum wage (since that's more than      <em>many</em> after-school jobs pay).    </p>    <p>      When I need assistance with lighter chores such as moving      split and seasoned timber from the garage into the truck or      onto my own porch-I sometimes recruit a couple of the      neighborhood youngsters who invariably show up to watch      "the guy with the garage full of wood". The children are      enthusiastic volunteers, and I can repay them with a mug of      hot chocolate and 509! or so.    </p>    <p>      PROBLEMS ...AND REWARDS    </p>    <p>      Of course, <em>no</em> business is without its negative      aspects ...and any number of problems can befall the urban      lumberjack. My biggest difficulty has been a lack of      storage space. My garage is always packed to the rafters      with drying wood ...and I'm also hard pressed to find a      suitable area in which to split and store the fuel. In      fact, if my customer list expands this fall, I'll have to      rent another garage or fenced lot where I can process the      orders.    </p>    <p>      Equipment failure can also hinder the smooth operation of      your enterprise. I missed out on the windfalls that      resulted from a tremendous storm last summer simply because      my chain saw was in "dry dock" at the repair shop. An old      truck can be counted on to conk out at any time, too      (usually when you're swamped with orders to deliver), and      everybody knows how expensive repair bills can be! Even the      simple splitting tools require maintenance: I've broken $20      worth of handles in one year!    </p>    <p>      And, as I mentioned earlier, the urban lumberjack should      always be on the lookout for wood-eating insects. Don't      take home any timbers that appear to be infested, and      <em>never</em> store a large supply of logs in your      basement or in an <em>attached</em> garage.    </p>    <p>      Finally, take precautions to avoid on-the-job accidents.      Always wear gloves, goggles, and earplugs when sawing trees      or limbs ...and keep your tools in safe working condition.      In addition, never increase the risk inherent in this kind      of work by tackling a job that you aren't <em>100% certain      you</em> can handle.    </p>    <p>      You know the old lumberjack's motto, "If you cut your own      wood, it'll warm you twice." Well, I consider that an      understatement: I find that cutting-and      selling-my own wood warms me <em>many</em> times. To      understand what I mean, picture yourself tramping through a      snow-covered lot in midwinter with an axe on your shoulder      ...splitting thick logs with a couple of clean strokes      ...delivering a load of fragrant, well-seasoned wood to a      satisfied customer ...pocketing some extra cash for the      holidays ...and, of course, sitting by your own roaring (      and free) fire on a stormy night.    </p>    <p>      Not many jobs-either city- or country      based-can offer such attractive working conditions      ...so I can just about guarantee that, should you decide to      become an urban woodcutter this winter, you'll "warm" to      your new occupation in no time!    </p>    <p>      Folks who are interested in heating (and cooking!) with      wood but who can't afford to buy a stove might want to      build MOTHER'S new do-it-yourself cookstove. It'll be      featured in MOTHER NO. 72!    </p>
