                       <p>      <em>As we've</em> <em>noted several times in these pages,      Helen and Scott Wearing are light years ahead of most of us      when it comes to getting back to the land anal livings life      of voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm      ...until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts      in the early 50;s, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over      again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses [Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wrholistic gardens ...just as      they're been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all (if us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient firing on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28791. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered here-and      here only-where we all can read what the Nearings have to      say.</em>    </p>    <p>      You have stated that you fast one day a week to peserve      your health. Why do you think fasting is good for you?    </p>    <p>      The physical organism craves nourishment to sustain itself      ...but many people, unfortunately, eat more than they      really need to maintain good health. We believe that a      little bit of discipline-in the form of short fasts-is good      for the body <em>and</em> the soul. Abstaining from food      and drink for brief periods is also said to be beneficial      because it allows the digestive organs to rest, revive, and      cleanse themselves.    </p>    <p>      If you're doubtful about the curative power of a fast, you      might want to try one the next time you feel a cold or      virus coming on. Simply stop eating immediately, and take      no liquids-except water -for a couple of days. You'll slim      down, clean out your system, and feel better for it ...and      any germs that may have been lying in wait will probably      disappear. <em>(EDITORS NOTE: Fasting, especially by those      who are inexperienced in such practices, should only be      done under a doctor's supervision.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Fasts-for us-are <em>enjoyable,</em> and we look forward to      them. With no meals to prepare, we have more time for other      homesteading activities ...and the days actually seem      longer.    </p>    <p>      Your books are so full of useful tips and hints on simple      cooking, freezing, and canning methods that I was wondering      if you have any advice on simple, natural ways to clean      house.    </p>    <p>      The key to easy housekeeping is to make sure your dwelling      itself is simple and natural to begin with. That way, you      can quickly clean what little dirt accumulates, and you'll      have more time to spend outdoors.    </p>    <p>      Our house is built of stone ...which means that it requires      no periodic repainting and no nailing of loose boards.      There's only creosote or old engine oil on the window and      door frames, so they require little or no upkeep. The      inside floors are atone, as well-and in several places      dark, small patterned linoleum -and need sweeping only      about once a week (or whenever someone tracks in mud and      dust). Also, the floors are kept bare, so we don't have      rugs to clean.    </p>    <p>      The interior wails are pine paneling that's been stained      permanently, so we have no white woodwork or wallpaper to      scrub. A quick wipe-down every once in a while is ail they      need ...and if a few cobwebs gather in the interim, they      merely complement our home's barnlike atmosphere! The      curtainless windows sometimes get smudged and murky, and we      just clean them with dampened newspaper (we add a little      vinegar to the water if the panes are extra dirty).      Finally, we keep a minimum of furniture, so there are very      few pieces to dust or move around.    </p>    <p>      Could you give us your ideas on natural ways of disposing      of wastes on one's own property ...as a means of recycling      and completing the self-sustaining ecochain?    </p>    <p>      We recycle all our household garbage and garden weeds in      our compost piles. Indoors, we have an ecological Swedish      "earth closet" instead of a conventional flush toilet. The      resulting material--which is half peat moss and garbage,      and half solid human waste-is carried out to the garden      periodically in buckets (it's entirely odorless) and either      incorporated into the compost or dug deep into the planting      beds. Urine, which collects separately In the Clivis      Multrum composting toilet, is later diluted and poured      around our fruit trees.    </p>    <p>      We're planning on retiring, in a couple of years, to our      acreage in northwest Kentucky ...where we hope to become as      self-reliant as possible. In these days of high-priced      energy, we're wondering whether it would be wise to keep a      horse to do all our cultivating, or to purchase some kind      of power equipment?    </p>    <p>      Unless you're going into farming on a commercial scale, we      don't recommend investing in either power equipment or      draft animals. You simply don't need a horse, mule, or ox      to work a home garden ...It's easy enough to do it yourself      with just a hand cultivator.    </p>    <p>      We have only one nonhuman-powered machine ...a      four-wheel-drive pickup truck that's been truly      indispensable to us. Because we live far from town, we've      learned that we must have a vehicle for transportation, and      the pickup is also invaluable for hauling firewood and      heavy timber ...carting gravel, sand, and rocks for our      building projects ...and bringing in seaweed for the      garden.    </p>    <p>      <em>Living the Good Life is</em> one of the most important      books I've ever read. I hope one day to be able to live as      naturally and as fully as you do. For a start, I am      thinking of becoming a vegan ...but I'm worried about the      nutritional risks of such a diet (specifically, the danger      of vitamin B-12 and calcium deficiencies). How do you deal      with that problem?    </p>    <p>      As vegetarians (but not complete vegans, since we      occasionally use dairy foods), we've made a point of      studying the record of B-12 and calcium deficiencies for      persons who abstain from all animal products. To make sure      we get enough of those essential nutrients, we take some      cottage cheese, Dutch cheese, and yogurt ...but we do avoid      eggs and milk. And although we're definitely and absolutely      against any consumption of animal flesh, we sometimes find      ourselves in a position-when we're away from home-of having      to consume some of the products of animal exploitation      (such as foods that contain eggs). No one is perfect      ...including the Nearings!    </p>    <p>      I'd be interested to know what kind of water you drink.      I've read that city water can contain as many as 47      different chemical additives, and that deep well water      sometimes has a lot of inorganic minerals in it.    </p>    <p>      When we moved to our homestead in Maine, we dowsed near the      house site, called in a professional to dig the well,      and-at a depth of 74 feet-discovered a steady flow of      delicious-tasting water. It's plumbed into the house, and      we can also pump it outside to the garden. Our water has      been tested and found to be perfectly safe for drinking.    </p>    <p>      As for city water, we try to avoid it when we're traveling,      because we think that it tastes unpleasant even when used      only for brushing teeth! The best solution, it would seem,      is to get out into the country-if possible-and find some      aqua pura.    </p>
