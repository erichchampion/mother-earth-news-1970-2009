                 <p>      This school year, try some of these ideas on how to ...    </p>             <p>      Though lots of parents take great pains to provide their      children with nourishing meals at home, such folk don't      always give as much thought to what the youngsters eat when      they're <em>out</em> of the house. And unfortunately, the      menus that are dished up in public school cafeterias are      quite often full of those very "demons"such as white flour,      sugar, and other highly processed foods-that you're      probably trying to eliminate from the family's diet      (furthermore, current federal budget trimming could soon      force cutbacks in school lunch programs).    </p>    <p>      Therefore, the only way to <em>know</em> that your small      student is getting a nutritious noontime meal every day is      to send the food <em>with</em> him or her. By preparing it      yourself, you can be sure the little one has a satisfying,      well-balanced lunch ... andsince it's likely that nobody      knows the idiosyncrasies of your youngster's palate better      than you do-you can match the contents of the "dinner      bucket" to the child's particular likes and dislikes.    </p>    <p>      Here, then, are recipes for some nutritious      carry-along edibles that were developed by MOTHER's      favorite health food chef, Deborah Dunn (who also whipped      up the spread for "A Summer Fishbake" in MOTHER NO. 70,      page 89). The meals are all easy and fun to put together      ...which means that youngsters may even enjoy helping with      the preparations!    </p>    <p>      SANDWICH IDEAS    </p>    <p>      Probably the single most popular item of lunch-box fare is      the sandwich ...and this simple noonday treat <em>can</em>      be more appetizing-and nutritious-than the old      white-bread-and-bologna standard. To prepare a      slightly sweet and energyboosting sandwich, spread peanut      (or <em>any</em> nut) butter on whole wheat bread, and top      it with banana slices, sunflower seeds, and raisins. Or, as      a variation, cover the proteinpacked filling with grated      carrot (or cucumber slices) and alfalfa sprouts.    </p>    <p>      Sprouts can also make a delicious and crunchy addition to      <em>cheese</em> sandwiches: Just spread the bread with      mayonnaise .. add thinly sliced cheddar, Swiss, or Monterey      Jack ... then pile on a thick layer of tender alfalfa      sprouts.    </p>    <p>      Cheese sandwiches can benefit from the addition of raw      vegetables, too. Butter your slices of bread (or use      mayonnaise), and add the cheese, either sliced or grated,      plus any one-or all-of the following vegetables: sliced      cucumbers, avocado, tomato, grated carrot, and diced onion.    </p>    <p>      You can also create many scrumptious lunches by whipping up      special fillings during the evening, and then making the      sandwiches the next morning (and, again, slip in fresh      sprouts to provide a nutritional bonus). A blend of 112 cup      of cottage cheese, 114 cup of chopped broccoli, 2      tablespoons of primary yeast flakes, and a dash of sea salt      tastes great on rye or cracked wheat bread. And any time      you have <em>oatmeal</em> loaves on hand, try putting two      pieces together with a tomato slice and a spread made of 4      ounces (half a large package) of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of      chopped walnuts, and a chopped halfstalk of celery. The      sweet taste of tahini spread will please any child when      it's smoothed on dark bread: Just mix together 1 cup of      tahini with 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds, 1/4 teaspoon of      honey, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.    </p>    <p>      OTHER OPTIONS    </p>    <p>      Of course, sandwiches-as nutritious and filling as      they are-don't have to be the only main courses your      children ever carry to school, because many leftover dinner      dishes can be recycled for the next day's lunch. A piece of      cold quiche travels well, as do      macaroni-and-cheese wedges. You might also like      to cut a slice or two of the previous evening's lentil nut      or millet loaf (or even a few spoonfuls of rice salad) to      be served alone or stuffed into pita bread pockets. Or      simply prepare a bag of finger food (such as cauliflower      and broccoli florets, whole mushrooms, carrot sticks,      asparagus spears, cherry tomatoes, cucumber strips, celery      stalks, and green pepper rings) along with a yogurt or sour      cream dip.    </p>    <p>      When packing snacks, don't succumb to the "easy out" of      grabbing individual bags of potato chips or cookies.      Instead, throw in a small container of homemade popcorn to      satisfy the munchies. Fresh fruit makes a delicious      dessert, too ... and it just may be sweet enough to help      your child avoid the urge to visit the candy machine! Toss      together whole strawberries, blueberries, banana sections,      melon cubes, and pineapple chunks ...then turn that fresh      fruit salad into a <em>special</em> treat by adding a cream      cheese or carob-honey sauce. Whole wheat or bran      muffins -with nuggets of dried fruit inside-are      also great school lunch desserts ...and, of course, they're      a lot more wholesome than are cake squares or candy bars!    </p>    <p>      DRINK UP!    </p>    <p>      While you're concocting imaginative dishes for your child's      noontime meals, remember that take-along lunches      don't <em>have to</em> be accompanied by plain milk, sugary      fruit punch, or (worse) soda pop. You can, instead, fill      your child's thermos with a hot, hearty soup      ...or-while the weather's still warm-try one of      the following cooling drinks that Deborah has devised. (You      can easily mix a large batch of any one of these in the      blender ...and make a healthful breakfast for yourself      while providing your youngster with a nutritious lunchtime      treat!)    </p>    <p>      To whip up a carob-banana <em>shake, blend</em>      together 1-1/2 cups of milk, 1 teaspoon each of honey and      carob, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and half a banana. Or, if      you think that your child would prefer a creamy drink,      combine 1 cup of plain yogurt, 2 teaspoons of honey, and 1      cup of any juicy fresh fruit (such as peaches,      strawberries, or oranges). A <em>honeydew      delight-which</em> can provide a pleasant change from      milkbased drinks-requires 1/2 cup each of chopped      melon and orange juice, plus 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.    </p>    <p>      A thick and tasty peanut <em>butter shake</em> will provide      enough protein to keep your youngster going all day! To      make one, blend 1/2 cup each of milk and plain yogurt with      1 tablespoon of peanut butter and 1 teaspoon of honey. You      might also want to try a <em>tomato supreme ...which</em>      is made by mixing together 1 cup of diced ripe tomatoes,      112 stalk of chopped celery, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and      a dash of salt. Finally, you can include a nice surprise in      your child's lunch box by making <em>spiced apple      juice.</em> Simply soak a cinnamon stick in one cup of      apple juice overnight, then remove it before pouring the      beverage into the thermos.    </p>    <p>      As you can see from the recipes provided here, box lunches      don't have to be either dreary and unappetizing <em>or      low</em> in nutritional value. If you want to be certain      your children are eating as well at school as they are at      home, send the young scholars off each day with a lunch box      full of homemade foods that you know you can trust. Sure,      it may take you a few minutes longer to prepare such meals      in the morning, but you can likely get the youngsters      themselves actively involved in the task ... which would      not only ease <em>your</em> workload, but would help them      become aware of sound eating habits, too!    </p>
