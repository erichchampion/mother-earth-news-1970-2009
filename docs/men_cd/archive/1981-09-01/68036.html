                 <p>      You may be able to augment your home or farmstead's water      supply for very little cost!    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>Al Adams<br /></strong></strong> Phot By      Hilary Adams<br />      Illustrations By The Author    </p>            <p>      A year ago-after spending the summer building our      house and bringing in a winter's worth of firewood-my      wife and I were faced with the question of how to take care      of our new homestead's water needs. Unfortunately, we      couldn't afford the $400 necessary to hire a local      contractor to backhoe a hole and install concrete spring      tile. So we were about resigned to carrying water from our      nearest neighbor's supply during the coming cold season      ...until I decided to take the bull by the horns and design      a do-it-myself shallow well.    </p>    <p>      To begin the project, I dug a three-foot-square hole at a      point where a natural spring ("seep" might be a more      accurate term) was located. I was careful to position my      pit back from, and a bit above, a nearby marshy area.      (Ideally, a well hole should be dug in late summer, when      the water table is at its lowest. At that season you'll      need to bail less while digging ...and you can be      reasonably sure of an adequate flow of water during the      wetter parts of the year.) I was relieved to hit bedrock at      a depth of 5-1/2 feet, since I would have had difficulty      excavating deeper with hand tools.    </p>    <p>      Once the pick-and-shovel work was behind me, I obtained two      55-gallon drums (they had formerly held glue) with locking      ring-sealed removable lids. A friend kindly volunteered the      use of his oxyacetylene torch, and before long the bottoms      of the two barrels were removed and I'd brazed the      cylinders together end to end ...producing a sturdy steel      tube about two feet in diameter and six feet long.      <em>/EDITOR'S NOTE: Torching used barrels, which could      contain flammable fumes, should be done outdoors and with      the greatest caution!/</em>    </p>    <p>      In order to clean the paint and adhesive from the barrels,      I built a scrapwood fire and placed the reservoir-to-be, on      end, over the blaze, with its base propped up on rocks to      allow air to reach the fire. Much to my surprise, a column      of yellow flame was soon shooting some <em>15 feet</em>      into the air, accompanied by the earthquake-like      rumble of a <em>very</em> violent draft. Within an hour the      paint had been vaporized by the intense heat and after      waiting for the metal to cool-I wire-brushed the      remaining residue from the metal and rolled the assembly      down to the hole.    </p>    <p>      Of course, before I could <em>install</em> my homemade      spring tile, I had to set up a system to filter the water      that would flow into it. Therefore, I shoveled a six-inch      deep layer of washed pea gravel into the bottom of the      hole. The double barrel was set on top that stone, and      another foot of gravel was poured around the outside of the      lower drum, to provide further cleansing. I then filled in      around the cylinder with clay-heavy earth to help      prevent surface water from seeping into the well.    </p>    <p>      My next project was to put together a mount for the hand      pump to be used with my water supply. I simply bored holes      in one of the leftover drum covers, to match the mounting      hardware on the pump's base, then cut a 2' X 2' square of      3/4" exterior grade plywood and bored openings in it to      match those in the lid. By sandwiching the wood between the      pump and the barrel lid, I was able to produce a sturdy      assembly. I finished this step by applying silicone      caulking around all of the fasteners, for further      protection against ground-water seepage.    </p>    <p>      After fishing a few floating leaves out of the water, I      lowered the pump and cover unit into place. Then I fitted a      length of 3/4" hose to the outlet on my pump (to avoid      having spilled water ac cumulate above my well) and began      the job of emptying out the somewhat murky liquid. There      was a fair amount of silt being carried in as the reservoir      refilled itself, and I had to pump out the well three times      to remove all traces of mud.    </p>    <p>      I also decided to chlorinate the water, to kill any      bacteria that might have been introduced during the      construction process. To do so, I mixed one quart of      household bleach with an equal amount of water, making a      solution capable of purifying 100 gallons of drinking      liquid. The mixture was then dumped into the well and the      system resealed with its locking ring <em>and</em> silicone      caulk. I pumped until a strong smell of chlorine was      evident at the hose outlet, then let the purifying chemical      do its work overnight. On the following morning, I pumped      the well out a few more times to remove all detectable      traces of bleach ...and my low-cost shallow well was ready      for use!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Anyone duplicating Mr. Adams's well might      want to consider using only barrels of heavy plastic or      otherwise --that are approved for food storage. The      author reports that his metal drums did eventually      introduce some rust into the water, which forced him to      install a filter. In addition, it's best to have any new      supply of water tested far purity if it's to be used by      humans, and to install a locking assembly on the lid to      prevent curious children from opening the well and,      perhaps, falling in.    </p>
