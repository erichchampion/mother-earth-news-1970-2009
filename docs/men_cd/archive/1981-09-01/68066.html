                    <p>      Photos by Bob Keim    </p>                		<p>	      As we've noted in this magazine before, a bicycle is about      the most efficient transportation device yet developed.      With its light weight and its highly effective roller      chain-and-sprocket drive system, the two-wheeled conveyance      is about five times more energy-thrifty-when distance and      weight are taken into account-than is either an      unaided human or an automobile.<br />      <br />      It should come as no surprise, then, that a lot of folks      would like to put this potential fuel-saver into proper      perspective in our energy-scarce world. Of course, in many      countries, the bicycle already plays as important (or more      so!) a transportation role as does the motorized vehicle      ...but in North America it's generally been relegated to      sporting or pleasure status. The International Human Power      Vehicle Association, however, hopes to change all that.      This Claremont, California-based group-founded, in 1974, by      bike-racing enthusiasts who were interested in expanding      the frontiers of vehicle design-has sponsored annual      speed championships since its inception, and, as a result      of the competitions, a new sort of machine has emerged      which just might be the forerunner of a swift, practical      humanpowered commuter vehicle!<br />      <br />      This year's IHPVA competition included several events in      two categories-single-and multiple-rider vehicles-and      contestants challenged each other for a total of $5,000 in      cash prizes. In the first event, the 200-meter time trials,      entrants competed to achieve the greatest possible velocity      over a flat 656-foot stretch (the machines used an      acceleration runway to build up speed before their run was      recorded). The second contest was an 18-mile road race      designed to test the maneuverability and road-handling      capability of the pedal-powered vehicles. And the speeds      recorded in both events were impressive ...averaging about      32 miles per hour for the distance race, and peaking at      close to 60 MPH in the sprints.<br />      <br />      In order to achieve such speeds, HPV builders must      concentrate primarily upon aerodynamic design, though rider      position does come into play, too. For example, at 30 miles      per hour, 90% of the energy expended by the rider of a      conventional bicycle is wasted trying to overcome wind      resistance ...and even more may be lost because the      standard seating position doesn't allow for maximum pedal      pressure. To decrease such inefficiency, the more radical      human-powered vehicles use tubular alloy frames surrounded      by airfoil shaped Hexcel fiberglass shells (or,      alternatively, load      bearing-and"slippery"composite-construction bodies      with small tubular subframes at stress points), and place      the rider in a supine (reclining on the back) or prone (on      the stomach) posture for maximum comfort and pedaling      power. Of course, some of the HPV designers practice      "middle ground" technology ...placing lightweight fairings      over slightly modified ten-speed bike frames<br />      <br />      At any rate, it's clear that a number of changes are      in store for the bicycle over the next few years, though      today's racing HPV's certainly aren't ready to hit the      streets-commercially-as yet. Nevertheless, any      vehicle that uses only 1/4 horsepower to move rapidly down      the highway deserves a lot of attention ...and we hope      these little energy-savers get plenty of it as time goes      on!<br />      <br />    </p>		<hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: MOTHER's Experimental Vehicle Newsletter is      available for one year (six issues) at a special charter      rate of $15.
