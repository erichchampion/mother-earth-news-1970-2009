        <p>With winter's winds already whistling (well, in our imaginations, at least) it's time to take a look at the old homestead heating system.</p><p>Illustration By The Author</p><p>Down on the farm (in our case, that little bit of heaven is located in upstate New York), winters get so harsh that icicles form on the <em>inside</em> of the windows just to get out of the cold! So a few years back, inspired by a particularly chilly spell, I set out to find a way to squeeze a little more heat out of the aged hardwood logs that were rapidly disappearing into the gullet of our Glenwood Oak stove.</p><p>The result was the squared circle of stovepipe shown in the accompanying illustration. I can't claim credit for <em>designing</em> the BTU scavenger, though, because I got the idea after noticing a similar rig in the background of a photo in an old issue of <em>National Geographic.</em></p><p>The square is made from standard eight-inch stovepipe. Two T's, four 90 Â° elbows, and a pair of straight sections are connected as shown in the sketch. The damper is located above the assembly, and from there-the pipe exits through the ceiling by way of an insulated, triple-wall thimble. All of the sections are fastened with sheet metal screws for security.</p><p>And-for safety's sake-let me remind you that any device which salvages heat from a stovepipe, as ours does, is going to encourage the formation of creosote ...and <em>that</em> could lead to a chimney fire. To prevent such an occurrence, I clean the inside of the assembly whenever the sooty buildup gets to be more than 1/4" thick, and replace all the pipe every second year. The latter may be an <em>expensive</em> practice, but good accident prevention is about the best insurance bargain I know of!</p>
