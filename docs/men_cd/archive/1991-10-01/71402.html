                        <h2 id="subtitle">      INSULATING YOUR LOG CABIN    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      BY HARRY YOST    </h5>    <p>      IT MAY COME AS A SURPRISE TO SOME, especially owners, but      many log houses should be insulated to make them energy      efficient. A look at the R-values will tell one reason why.      Dry wood can have an R-value of up to 1.25 per inch. Even      lowquality insulation has a value double that and more.    </p>        <p>      Another problem not often considered is moisture. Where      does the moisture in the house go when the outside wall is      solid wood? It still tries to get out, and might if there      are cracks in the logs.    </p>    <p>      The propensity for moisture-laden air to move outside has      been utilized in the past to make a log house better      insulated. In the far north, where winter temperatures may      stay below freezing for months, it was a common practice to      seal the house from the inside. This was done by putting      several containers of water on the stove and bringing them      to a boil. The vapor traveled to the outside thr ugh the      cracks. It immediately froze on contact with the outside      air, effectively scaling the house until the outside air      temperature again was above 32°F This cut down on      drafts and made for a snug house, at least until the      weather warmed up.    </p>    <p>      Logs have another property that helps explain why log      houses don't seem to be as cold as their R-value would      indicate: They are capable of storing heat. Logs in a house      wall will absorb beat up to the temperature of the air in      the house. When the house temperature is lowered-at      night, for example-they give back heat into the rooms      until the temperature is again equalized. Unlike a block or      a stone wall, logs can be two temperatures simultaneously,      one on either side.    </p>    <h3>      Chinking    </h3>    <p>      Where basic insulation for a log house is needed, even if      none is required elsewhere, is between the logs. No matter      what type of log construction is used-round fitted,      flattened, three-sided, or round with      chinking-a thin layer of insulation should be put      between each log and those above and below it. This fills      irregularities between the logs and closes cracks open to      the outside. Caulking or "chinking" is then done on either      side of the insulation.    </p>    <p>      The size of the logs makes a difference. Many modem log      houses are made of logs 8" or less in diameter. Two-sided      and three-sided logs are often only 6" thick. When placed      in a wall, there may be only 3" or 4" of contact surface      between the logs. This contact is the thickness that should      be considered when thinking of additional insulation. Not      only is the joint between logs thinner than the Mgt but      that is the place where there will be leaks in the wall if      any exist.    </p>    <p>      Even houses made of turned logs (logs turned to a given      diameter in a large lathe, then grooved with a machine to      give a very tight fit) need insulation and caulking where      logs meet. This type of construction is a machinemade      variation of the old Scandinavian system of building log      houses. Most of these houses use logs turned to 20" or less      in diameter, with only about 8" of thickness where the logs      rest on each other.    </p>    <p>      Some log-house builders still hand-fit the logs in the same      Scandinavian style. They usually use logs from 20" to 36"      in diameter, and will have a thickness of 12" or more where      they join. This type of construction is usually done only      on contract.    </p>    <p>      Factory-built log houses are most common today. The logs      may be only 6" to 8" thick, and are often squared on two or      more sides for ease in construction. One maker of log-home      kits even starts with 8 X 8 timbers, running them through a      machine that rounds one side (for the outside of the      cabin), and puts a tongue and groove in the top and bottom      for a tight fit. The inside surface of the log is dressed      smooth so that it looks like lumber. This construction      needs a strip of insulation between the "logs" and caulking      in the crack between the logs on both the inside and the      outside.    </p>    <h3>      Peeled Logs    </h3>    <p>      Some log-home builders use hand-peeled logs, without doing      anything else to them. The bark of the log is removed by a      man wielding a large drawknife. then the logs are fitted      into the house by notching the ends so there will be as      small a crack as possible between each set of logs. Usually      the logs are no more than 8" in diameter on the small end      and no larger than 14" in diameter on the large end. As a      wall is built, the large end of one log is placed atop the      small end of another to get a close fit between the logs.      Once the logs have been fitted for a house at the factory,      they are numbered and trucked to the home site, where they      are reassembled.    </p>        <p>      When the house is up, the gaps between the logs are stuffed      with fiberglass insulation; then a vinyl material that      won't shrink away from the logs is applied, sealing the      crack. The wall between the logs may be only 3" thick, and      filled with a material that has a lower R-value than the      logs themselves, so the insulation value is low.    </p>    <h3>      Roofs    </h3>    <p>      Log houses often differ from frame houses in the roof. In      order to get the most rustic feeling from a log house, the      roof is often open beam. In that case the insulation must      be put on top. In the good old days, sod was often the      material used, with up to a couple of feet being placed on      top of the house. This entailed a heavy roof structure, as      sod can weigh up to 75 pounds a cubic foot. Even though sod      has approximately the same R-value as fiberglass, nowadays      it will probably be more expensive.    </p>    <p>      What we might term as rustic or old-fashioned was, more      often than not, done for reasons of sheer necessity by our      forebears.    </p>    <p>      Log houses were built because there were Moore than enough      trees, and the trees needed to be cleared from the land to      grow food. Sod was also plentiful, especially in places      where there was some prairie. It was there for the taking.      A couple of men with a saw and axes and a flat shovel,      often carved from a split log, could build a solid house in      a couple of days, with the expenditure of nothing more than      sweat.    </p>    <p>      They also weren't concerned about fuel to keep the place      warm. If it was cold, they built the fire up more. "Energy      efficiency" wasn't in their vocabulary. Neither was      "insulation", except in the far north country where tundra      moss was used to stuff the cracks between logs or stones,      and was often applied in a thick layer on the roof.    </p>    <p>      During experiments on the insulation value of indigenous      building materials, University of Alaska engineers      discovered that dried tundra moss has a higher insulation      value than most manufactured insulations. Of course, unless      you live on the tundra, the cost of obtaining the moss Puts      it out of reach. It is also very flammable and would      probably be banned by most fire codes.    </p>    <h3>      Adding Insulation    </h3>    <p>      Most log houses use insulation only be tween the logs.      However, you must do something to increase the insulation      <em>along</em> the logs to make your cabin truly an      energy-efficient house. This means building a wall on the      inside of the log wall. This should be thick enough to      provide energy efficiency. It should also have a vapor      barrier on the warm (room) side to reduce moisture flow      into the log wall as much as possible. Once the vapor      barrier is in place, the wall can be finished as desired.      The barrier is an extra expense, but if the log walls of      the house are as thin as some described earlier, it may be      necessary for the conservation of energy.    </p>    <p>      A roof on a log house has the same problems as one on a      frame house, and should be treated the same way. In order      to keep the rustic effect and utilize the efficiency of      modem insulation, some log-home owners have insulated their      roof with urethane foam and then added a layer of sod to      complete the illusion of a rustic dwelling. The same      problems and benefits apply here as they do for a regular      framed roof. The point is to get the highest possible      insulation value for the money spent.    </p>    <p>      <em>Reprinted from</em> <em>Home Insulation: Do It Yourself      & Save As Much As 40% (Storey Communications).</em>    </p>    <h3>      INSURING DUCTS AND PIPES    </h3>    <p>      ONE OF THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE and energy-conserving      measures you can take is to insulate duct or pipe runs in      the unheated areas of your home. By not insulating these      conduits you are essentially delivering heat that you've      paid for to areas of your house you never use. One very      important note: Never place duct or pipe insulation within      three feet of the heating system, exhaust flues, or any      other hightemperature areas.    </p>    <p>      To insulate, install vinyl or foil-backed fiberglass duct      insulation to all heatingsystem supply ducts. You can also      use reguht-faced fiberglass insulation, which is less      expensive and has a higher R-value (a measure of the      ability to retard heat flow; the higher the number, the      better the insulation). To determine how much insulation      you need, first measure the distance around each section of      duct and multiply that by the total length. Order about 30%      more than the amount calculated to account for the overlaps      needed for fastening.    </p>    <p>      Before you insulate, be sure to seal all air leaks in the      system with duct tape and/or a high-temperature caulk such      as silicone. Then, cover the supply ducts with insulation      and secure it using clinch-type staples (preferred), wire,      or tape. Although not as long-lasting as staples, duct tape      is easier to install. The tape should be wrapped completely      around the duct and overlapped. The backing of the      insulation must be on the outside surface. Exposed      fiberglass and all joints between pieces of insulation      should be covered with tape.    </p>    <p>      Damper control handles must be left in an accessible and      operable position. Any labels on the ducts should be      transferred to the outside of the insulation. Do not      insulate your return ducts.    </p>    <p>      To insulate your pipes, follow these rules:    </p>    <p>      For hot-water systems, install "elastomeric or urethane      rubber pipe insulation with a suggested minimum R-value of      6-only on supply pipe. This insulation may not be      used in applications where the temperature of the pipe      exceeds 200°F (such as on steam pipes). For steam      systems, install molded fiberglasspipe insulation with a      minimum recommended R-value of 6 on all supply pipes.      Before you purchase the insulation, carefully measure the      outside diameter and lengths required. Remember to add a      little for waste at joints. Before installation, check for      leaks in the system. If you find any, repair it before you      proceed. To install, place pipe insulation over the pipes,      and seal with either glue, duct tape, or appropriate      fasteners. Exposed ends of insulation sections at joints      should be tightly scaled to eliminate air flow beneath the      insulation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TUNE UP YOUR OIL BURNER!</strong>    </p>    <p>      WHEN YOU SCHEDULE A TUNE-UP, ask your service company about      reducing the firing rate of the burner. Most burners are      oversize, and significant savings can be achieved by      downsizing the nozzle.    </p>    <p>      The burner nozzle controls the firing rate (the rate of oil      flow in gallons per hour). Only your fuel supplier has the      records necessary to determine if this is applicable.    </p>    <p>      Make sure your serviceperson leaves a tag attached to the      heating system which records the final combustion      efficiency, smoke reading, percent carbon dioxide (CO 2 ),      net stack temperature, and any other work done. Combustion      efficiency indicates what percentage of fuel your burner      turns into heat.    </p>    <p>      Make sure your tune-up also includes the following 13 key      checks for a winter-ready oil burner:    </p>    <p>      combustion chamber cleaned thoroughly or replaced heat      exchanger cleaned oil-pump pressure checked and regulated,      if needed oil filter replaced all operating and safety      controls checked pump and blower motors checked and oiled      barometric draft regulator checked, adjusted, or replaced,      depending on its condition burner fan, motor, electrodes,      and transformer cleaned and lubricated oil pump bled (if      necessary) nozzle replaced (you should do this every year)      leaks into the unit sealed potential of "baffling"      installation assessed (important in older units) final      combustion tests completed; tag attached to the heating      system which shows the final combustion efficiency.    </p>    <h3>      Talking Caulk    </h3>    <p>      SINCE AS MUCH AS 80% of air leakage occurs in areas other      than windows and doors, caulking is all absolute winter      necessity. In addition to checking windows and doors, be      sure to inspect the areas where:    </p>    <p>      the wooden sill of We home meets the foundation dryer vents      and fan covers pass through the wall furnace vent stacks      meet the exterior any air leaks in the basement might lurk      plumbing pipes and telephone wires enor We home any two      different outside materials meet the fireplace chimney      meets the siding. As a general rule caulk where a pemanent      sea! is desired. and weather-strip when doors and windows      must be opened.    </p>    <p>      After determining which areas need attention, it's      important to choose the right type of caulk for the job.      Before buying or using a particular caulk, read each label      carefully for storage and application temperatures. Check      the descriptions below, then refer to the chart to      determine We but caulk for the job. While the factors may      be of varying concern depending on personal preference      (amount of money you're willing lengths you are willing to      go to find a certain caulk, time you wish to spend redoing      the job in a few years), it is important to check the      temperature resistance of any caulk if you live in a very      cold climate.    </p>        <p>      <strong>OIL-RESIN BASE.</strong> This is often the 01 least      expensive. It is not particulardurable, and tends to shrink      and harden It call be painted. This may harden, It can be      painted, This ma terial is found in most stores. It should      not be used for long-term application.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LATEX MOM</strong> This will bond to mom sun faces.      It is more durable than resin-based material, and also      paintable. Some shrinkage will occur. Adequate, but not the      best material available.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUTYL RUBBER.</strong> This paintable material will      bond to most surfaces. It is more durable than the others,      but it also shrinks. This is often the best choice for use      on massonry surfaces, but not on moving joints or places      where two different materials meet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POLYVINYL ACETATE.</strong> Ths will bond to most      surfaces and is more durable, but it also shrinks and      hardens, This sealant is surpassed by ither compounds.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NITRILE RUBBER.</strong> This bonds well to metal      and masonry hilt not to painted materials. It is durable      and paintable, but large amounts of shrinkage are reported.      Its primary use is For high moisture areas.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NEOPRENE RUBBER.</strong> This will bond to most      surfaces and is expensive but durable and paintable.      Moderate shrinkage is reported. This is especially good for      use in concrete walls and foundations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SILICONE SEAL.</strong> This will bond to most      surfaces except concrete. It is very e xpensive and very      durable boll not paintable. Little shrinkage is reported.      It remains very flexible. This is an excellent caulk for      most jobs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PULYSULFIDE.</strong> This needs a primer to bond      to surfaces. It is expensive and very durable, and little      shrinkage is reported. This is difficult to work with,      however, and is toxic until cured. It can dry out in add      climates.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POLTURETHANE.</strong> This will bond to most      surfaces. It, too, is expensive, very durable, and      paintable. Little shrinkage reported.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NYPALON. This</strong> requires priming for use on      porous materials. It is expensive, very durable, and      paintable. Little shrinkage is re ported. An excellent      caulk, easy to work with but, again, not always readily      available.    </p>    <p>      Now that you've found the correct material for the job,      you're on to the easy part, caulking your house for winter.      Here's how:    </p>    <p>      Before installing caulk, remove all loose material and dirt      from the crack, or the caulk won't adhere to the surface.      Men caulking a wide crack (3/8" or greater), stuff it to      within a fraction of an inch of the surface with a filler      material urethane tan oakum a fiberglass batt) and then      apply caulking material. Cut off the tip of the nozzle on      the tube at an angle so that it gives you a bead of caulk      no wider than you need. Next, pierce the inner seal of the      cartridge. If necessary, smooth the newly applied bead of      caulk immediately after applying it with a tool like a      putty knife, or your fingers. You will soon acquire a      technique that allows you to apply the caulk to the crack      firmly and smooth it to an acceptable finish in one pass of      the caulk gun. Caulk should adhere properly to the surfaces      around the crack. Problems of inadequate bonding can be      caused by poor cleaning of the crack area, incorrect caulk      type, or improper placement. If the caulk that seals your      storm is drying out or missing, caulk the top, sides, and      bottom of the storm-window frame from the inside (between      the sash and storm). Leave the weep holes at the bottom of      your storm window unplugged: they allow excess moisture to      drain out.    </p>
