                <h3>      <em>SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</em>    </h3>        <p>      The why's, what's, and how's of taking cover this autumn    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Stu Campbell    </h5>        <p>      FALL MULCHING HAS MANY BENEFITS not the least of which, as      far as I'm concerned, is that you can walk around in your      garden on rainy days and not have three inches of sticky      mud on the soles of your shoes when you come back inside.    </p>    <p>      But besides acting as organic StainMaster, laying mulch in      the fall (and mulching anytime, really) reduces water loss      in soil, suppresses weed growth, and protects plants from      temperature extremes-the final warm October days and      first wintry November nights.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Soil Moisture Retention</strong>    </p>    <p>      Mulch's ability to conserve soil moisture has long been      documented. It may be its most universally recognized      virtue. While authorities and test results differ, it is      clear that moisture evaporation from soil covered with      mulch is reduced anywhere from 10 to 50%. Whichever you      accept, the water-conserving value of mulching can't be      overemphasized, especially in these times of water      restrictions and shortages.    </p>    <p>      Mulch keeps the soil from drying out partly because it      prevents dew and water drawn up from the subsoil from      escaping. Contrary to what a lot of people believe, dew is      not simply condensation of water from the atmosphere. It is      also condensation of moisture from the air pockets found in      the soil. Most dew is completely wasted, as far as plant      growth is concerned, unless there is something on the      surface to catch it and prevent it from evaporating.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Weed Suppression</strong>    </p>    <p>      As for weed control, one study has found weeding time to be      reduced by almost two-thirds through the use of mulches.      Proper mulching can practically eliminate the need for      weeding and cultivating.    </p>    <p>      There are a few catches, however. First, the mulch itself      must be weed-free. Many a gardener has had the best      mulching intentions go astray with one application of      weed-strewn hay or manure. They end up introducing more      weeds to their garden than they controlled.    </p>    <p>      Second, a mulch must be deep enough to prevent existing      weed seeds from germinating. As with most other seeds,      weeds need light to germinate. Those weeds trying to come      up under a mulch sprout in darkness and wither away. If a      mulch is apold too thinly or unevenly, weeds may still find      their way through. So when applying your mulch, you'll want      to think like a weed and cover all the open areas.    </p>    <p>      Finally, mulches won't smother all weeds. Some particularly      tough weeds have the fortitude to push themselves up      through just about any mulch. These should be easy to spot,      however, and even more easily plucked when growing in a      mulched bed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Soil Temperature</strong>    </p>    <p>      The effect mulching has on soil temperatures is probably      one of the most often overlooked benefits. Many of us are      more concerned with aboveground temperatures and don't      spend much time pondering what's happening underground.      Simply stated: Mulch is insulation. It keeps the soil      around your plants' roots cooler on warm days and warmer on      cold nights. This is especially important during rapid      temperature shifts.    </p>    <p>      In cold weather, mulch works to prevent the soil from      alternately freezing and thawing, which leads to soil      heaving and root damage. This doesn't mean the soil won't      freeze; it just won't happen overnight. It's those rapid      changes that not only threaten aboveground growth, but may      also send tender plant roots into shock, Winter mulches are      usually applied in the fall after the plants are dormant,      and are removed the following spring.    </p>    <h3>      What to Mulch    </h3>                <p>      You'll want to mulch anything that needs protection from      moisture loss, temperature change, or weed infestation In      the fall, though, more often than not that means      rhododendrons, azaleas, roses, bulbs, and annuals. I say      "more often than not" because, with seasons and climates      varying so much throughout the country, a blanket statement      would be inaccurate. That said, here is my advice.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rhododendrons and azaleas.</strong> As far as these      are concerned, unmulched plants, or those with an      insufficient amount of mulch, may suffer from chlorosis      (yellow or blanched leaves), weak or underdeveloped leaves,      or even death. These plants cannot tolerate hot, dry soil.      Their feeding roots are severely injured under such      condidont and be plant has trouble putting out healthy      leaves, never mind spectacular blooms. Mulching can help      cool the roots and hold moisture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>In addition,</strong> since these are mostly      evergreen plants, which carry their leaves all winter, they      are continually losing water to the air. If there is an      inadequate amount of soil moisture, the plant will lose      water faster than it can replace it. The end result will be      brown, scorched foliage, which in extreme cases may just      give up the ghost and drop off. By watering the ground well      and mulching in the fall, you can insulate the soil from      sudden temperature changes and ensure that rhododendrons      have an ample moisture supply.    </p>    <p>      Rhododendrons and azaleas both prefer slightly acid soils,      and your mulch selec tion can play a part. I suggest you      choose an organic mulch, like leaves or pine needles. A      dry-leaf mulch (especially oak leaves), spread 10 to 12      inches deep, can be laid down at planting (these will      decompose quickly to give you a 3- or 4-inch layer). A 2-      or 3-inch layer of pine needles will also do the trick.      Wood chips or sawdust-if they are weathered-or      peat moss can be substituted for pine needles.    </p>    <p>      If you are using one of these mulches and watering your      rhododendrons following a fertilizer schedule but still      have an unhealthy-looking plant, there must be something      eke going on Maybe you hue an insect or disease problem or      grew the wrong variety for your part of the country. But      let's not blame the mulch. It has a bad enough rap as it N.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Roses, Jug</strong> about everyone who grows roses      agrees that putting down a layer of mulch after the ground      has started to cool is necessary to protect plants from      temperature extremes and heaving. What they don't agree on      is how to do it. Mulching roses in the fall is fairly      simple if you remember why you're doing it. Most roses am      amazingly hardy, so Me mulch isn't meant to keep them from      freezing. The goal is to maintain constant temperature and      avoid repeated freezing and taming.    </p>    <p>      There are hundreds of methods and materials for preparing      roses for winter-almost as many as there are rose growers.      Probably the most accepted is to mound about 10 to 12      inches of mulch around the base of the rosebush. This      should not be done until after the first hard frost. If      done too early, the roses may be fooled into a late growth      spurt, which will delay dormancy and lead to more winter      injury, not less.    </p>    <p>      What you decide to do from this point is open to all kinds      of possibilities. In areas where Me temperature stays well      below freezing for most of the season, you will want to      provide some additional protection. Some ]can toward the      Styrofoam "rose cones" that fit around the mounds; others      prefer ground corncobs, sawdust, or chopped leaves.    </p>    <p>      The rose cones work well when used in conjunction with      mounded soil. They can overheat during those sunny January      thaws, so it's a good idea to poke a ventilation hole in      the top. Another suggestion is to weight the cone down with      a stone or something similar; otherwise your rose cones may      end up in the neighbor's yard.    </p>    <p>      Wire cages filled with leaves or compost are often used in      lieu of the Styrofoam cones. These cages needn't be stuffed      to the gills with leaves. That makes for poor Or      circulation and may lead to disease problems,    </p>    <p>      Whichever system you select, water the sot well before      covering your roses and remove the mulch in the spring      before new growth begins. If the mulch is left on until      buds start swelling, it may put the new growth into shock      when you remove it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bulbs.</strong> Certainly, mulching bulbs is not      essential. But here in the great Northeast, the insulating      value of a nice, thick organic mulch can't be overlooked.      In Vermont, springflowering bulbs like tulips and daffodils      are planted in late September or early October. The bulbs      need time to develop their roots before the ground freezes      and they lapse into winter dormancy. To postpone their long      winter's nap, I protect them with a layer of rotted manure,      leaves, or compost.    </p>    <p>      Wood chips, corncobs, sawdust-just about any      mulch-will inhibit the emergence of your bulbs. If      they can push up through a wet spring soil or several      inches of snow, I doubt a couple of inches of mulch will      slow them down.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Annuals.</strong> Mulch your annual beds      earlybefore the first frost has settled into the soil-so      that earthworms and beneficial microorganisms can stay at      work longer during the cold months.    </p>    <p>      Wait, you say, is that everything I have to mulch to      prepare for cold weather? Yes and no. Yes, this is a good      place to start, but you know through your own experience      what your season is like, so act accordingly And no mew's      more to mulch after the ground has cooled. In the next      issue (# 129), I'll discuss winter mulching of delicate and      hardy vegetables, fruits, and woody plants in Mulching,      Part II.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's note: Stu Campbell is the author</em> of The      Mulch But: A Complete Guide for Gardeners, <em>from which      this article is adapted It's available from Storey      Communications (Schoolhouse Rd., Pownal, VT 60261 or Call      800/827-8673; $819).</em>    </p>
