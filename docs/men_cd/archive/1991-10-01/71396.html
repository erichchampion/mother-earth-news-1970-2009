                <h3>      Just apples, a flaky crust, and....    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Mary Karenou    </h5>        <p>      YOU'D BE HARD-PRESSED to find a more popular fall      dessert than apple pie. You'd probably be hard-pressed to      find a more popular dessert any time of the year. But as      the leaves fall and the air cools, a harvest of apples can      only signal one thing-pie season. While apple pies      grace dinner tables (as well as lunch boxes, late-night      snack runs, stolen bites at breakfast, you name it) and      restaurant menus year-round these days, there is something      magical about a slice of ovenwarm apple pie on a crisp fall      night: steam wafting from a vented top, fragrant cinnamon      and sugar harmonizing with the sliced apples to produce a      delightful crustbusting ooze, and vanilla ice cream or      cheddar melting with the whole business like a lovestruck      teenager at the high school homecoming dance.    </p>    <p>      For as many opportunities as there are to eat apple pie,      there are an equal number of variations. The school of      thought on apple pie recipes ranges from the puristic (a      vented double crust, a little lemon juice, a touch of sugar      for taste, and perhaps an egg or a bit of flour to keep the      mess together) to the blasphemous (the land of crisps,      crackles, and crumbs). Once you've sorted through that,      there are the debates over sliced vs. chunked, precooked      vs. raw, peeled vs. unpeeled, single crust vs. double      crust, baking quickly at one high temperature vs. lowering      to a moderate oven ... well, you get the idea.    </p>    <p>      The quest for the "perfect" apple pie recipe is a subject      of lengthy and heady debate, a matter I certainly wouldn't      presume to settle (I was once told never to enter into any      argument that involves someone's mother). However, within      all the shades of gray, there are some fail-safe truths to      baking a perfect apple pie.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Use an apple that will hold its shape.</strong> Be      sure that your apple is firm enough to withstand cooking.      Applesauce is a lovely confection, just as long as it's not      wrapped in your pastry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Check the pie every few minutes or so toward the      end of baking.</strong> Crusts and toppings can burn      quickly. Ten minutes of forgetfulness will leave your      effort faintly resembling a pile of charcoal briquettes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Start with a fresh crust.</strong> It should be      simple: just flour, butter, water, sugar, salt. Yet,      whether due to time constraints or timidity, many people      are turning to frozen crusts. A good number of these, in      all fairness, prove to be quite passable. But even if your      fellow pie-eaters don't know you cheated, you'll know.      While the capacity for creating something suspiciously      close to a lead pancake certainly exists, the benefits of      learning once and for all how to make pastry are numerous      (it tastes better, costs pennies, and you don't feel like      you just lip-synched the national anthem).    </p>        <p>      <strong>Be willing to experiment</strong> . Nobody gets      everything right the first time; don't expect your pie      recipe to be any different. Adjust the oven temperature if      the pastry is soggy, add a little more flour if the mixture      is too runny, mix in some lemon juice if the apples aren't      tart enough, cut back on the cinnamon or sugar if too heady      or sweet (there can be too much of a good thing), etc.    </p>    <p>      Seeing as I am not brave enough to choose a "perfect" apple      pie-or vain enough to publish my own favorite (my      mother's Dutch apple, I must confess)-I am very      grateful that Stark Bro's Nurseries (located in the town of      Louisiana, Missouri) set upon this awesome task in their      contest to find the perfect fruit pie. The recipes below      are a sampling from among the contest's 100 award-winning      recipes, collected in the book <em>Perfect Fruit Pies</em>      (Storey Communications; $9.95).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Awesome Apple Pie</strong>    </p>    <p>      Yield: 8 servings<br />      Crust:<br />      <em>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br /></em> <em>1      tablespoon sugar<br />      1/2 cup chilled, unsalted butter<br />      1 egg yolk<br />      2 tablespoons ice water</em>    </p>    <p>      Filling:    </p>    <p>      <em>1 1/2 pounds Granny Smith apples<br /></em>      <em>Sugar<br />      3 tablespoons melted butter<br />      4 fresh apricots<br />      4 tablespoons apricot jam<br />      2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or 2 tablespoons Cointreau      liqueur</em>    </p>    <p>      For crust, place flour and sugar in a mixing bowl. With two      knives, cut in butter until crumbly. Mix egg yolk and ice      water together and gradually add to flour mixture. Form      into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour.    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 400°F Butter an 11- or 12-inch pie dish      with removable bottom. On a floured surface, roll out dough      to 3/16 thickness, just to fit the pie dish. Prick with a      fork. Line pan with aluminum foil and fill with dry beans.      Bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans and bake about      10 minutes more or until slightly browned. Cool.    </p>    <p>      Reduce heat to 320°F Peel, core, and slice apples. Roll      each slice in sugar and cook in melted butter until sugar      has caramelized and is light brown. Repeat until all apples      have been coated and cooked.    </p>    <p>      Slice apricots and cook the same way as apples. Place on a      plate to cool. Arrange fruit in concentric circles in pie      crust until covered and all fruit is used. Heat apricot jam      in a saucepan. Add lemon juice or Cointreau and spoon over      fruit in pie crust. Bake for 15 minutes. Serve warm or at      room temperature with fresh whipped cream.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Felicity Gatchell<br />      Birmingham, Alabama</em>    </p>    <p>      Richard's Apple-Blackberry Pie    </p>    <p>      <em>Yield: 6 servings<br /></em> <em>Pastry for two 9-inch      pie crusts<br />      3 tablespoons melted butter (no margarine)<br />      5 cups peeled and sliced Jonathan or Granny Smith      apples<br />      2 cups blackberries<br />      1/2 cup granulated sugar<br />      1/4 cup brown sugar<br />      4 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br />      2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice<br />      Milk</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350°F.

THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS that make all the      difference: the ingredients you use and the temperature of      the ingredients as you work with them.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Flour.</strong> Unbleached white flour will give      the best results. but if you plan to refrigerate unbleached      flour dough for a few clays before baking, it will turn      gray. (Freezing the dough, on the other hand, Will Dot turn      it gray.) So, if you wish to use half the dough now and      half later on, use all-purpose white flour. Whole-wheat      flour, used alone, makes an acceptable. if heavy, crust;      you can, if you Wish, substitute it for no more than a      quarter Of the white flour called for in a recipe.      Whole-wheat Hour can usually he found at any health-food      store or food co-op    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fats.</strong> The choices here are butter,      margarine vegetable shortening, and lard; some cooks use      oil, though I don't recommend it. The old standbys are      butter Lind lard, used together in various proportions.      This a Crust that is delicious but not exactly what the      doctor ordered for an one concerned with cholesterol      levels. An all-margarine crust is possible, though it's      important to keep the margarine very cold (in fact, you may      even wish to start out with it frozen). A good combination      is 5 parts cold butter or frozen margarine to 1 part lard      or vegetable shortening    </p>    <p>      <strong>Liquids.</strong> Ice water is the usual choice,      but any thin. cold liquid can he used. Orange juice, for      instance, used half-and-half with water, makes a lovely      crust for certain pies. When assembling the ingredients for      your crust, put whatever liquid you'r e using in a      measuring cup, along with a few ice cubes, By the time you      want to add the liquid, it will be thoroughly cold. It is      impossible to say what the "right amount" of liquid will      be, since different flours absorb different amounts of      liquid; in addition, the same kind of flour may need more      liquid on dry days or less when the humidity is high. If      you use too much liquid. you're apt to have a tough crust;      too little, and you'll have a crust that falls apart and is      difficult to work with. Don't be frightened by these dire      warnings, though. The key is to add the liquid slowly and      stop when You've added just enough to make the dough hold      together nicely.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Salt, sugar, other seasonings?</strong> Use salt if      you wish, but it's really unnecessary. Many cooks add      sugar-a tablespoon or so-to the crust for any      fruit pie; others wouldn't dream of doing so. Make your own      choice. Other additions are possible. A little grated      citrus peel. for instance, can be pleasant, and on occasion      you might want to add a few pinches of nutmeg or cinnamon.      It's up to you!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Temperature.</strong> The importance of using      cold-or even frozen-margarine and of thoroughly      chilling whichever liquid you use bears repeating, This is      because it's vital important to keep the fat you're using      from becoming soft for even, heaven f or bid, melting)      before the Crust goes into the oven. This is the true,      greatest secret of' a flaky crust-the ingredients      must be cold, and the crust must be kept chilled as much of      the time as possible until it is baked. The alternative is      a sog-gy heavy crust, which you won't want to      acknowledgement was made by you. For this reaso n, it's      important to use cold butter (or other fat) and ice water.      Also, if you are making the crust in a hot kitchen, or find      it necessary to work on the crust for even a few minutes,      pop the dough into your re frigerator until it's cold and      firm.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Method.</strong> Until fairly recently, all      piecrust dough was made by hand, usually by cutting fat      into the flour with a pastry blender or a knife held in      each hand. People able to work very quickly with then-      hands, even use their fingertips to combine the fat and the      flour. Using this method, the fat is Cut into the Mixture      until it resembles coarse cornmeal: then the liquid is      quickly stirred in. Many people still do this. but Most of'      those who have used a food processor are convinced that it      makes the best crust, since the whole process 'is ac      complished so quickly that the dough doesn't have a chance      to warm up. The instructions below call for the use of a      food processor, but the crust can also be made by hand.    </p>    <p>      Pie pan. Experts agree that pies made in glass or black      steel pie pans have the best crisp. evenly browned crusts.      The worst choice, contrary to what many people think, is a      shiny metal pie pan. Most cooks also grease the inside of      the pie pan or spray it with a nonstick vegetable coating    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rolling out the dough.</strong> The two main things      to remember when you're rolling out flaky pastry dough are      not to kill the dough by overworking it and to keep it cold      at all times. Any sort of rolling pin or other cylindrical      shape will do-even a wine or soda bottle in a      pinch-but the very best and easiest results come from      a fairly large, heavy rolling pin. (You can occasionally      find a hollow rolling pin that can be filled with ice      water.) The idea is to lime the pin do the work, not you.      Roll tile dough on a lightly floured surface (a bread      board, a kitchen counter, a pastry cloth, or especially, a      slab of marble, which will stay cool). Sonic bread boards      and Pastry cloth,, come with circles of various Wes printed      on them; this can be quite a help. If the dough is very      cold and you find it hard to work- with, bang it a few      times with the rolling pin.    </p>    <p>      Begin to roll the dough into a circle that is 2 inches      larger than your pie pan, rolling from tile center outward      and not roiling over the edge of the dough. Turning the      dough from time to time helps in this process. You may have      to sprinkle a little more flour on both the rolling surface      and the pin. When you have your circle of dough (and it can      be a fairly rough circle), roll it up on your lightly      floured rolling pin and unroll it over the pie pan.    </p>    <p>      Now ease the dough down into the pan by lifting the edges,      Push it down a little around the sides, which you want to      be a little thicker than the bottom. Cut off the excess      dough-the best way to do this is to run your rolling      pin over the top. Next, push the dough up so that it's      uniformly about 1/8 inch above the pie pan.    </p>    <p>      <strong>For a single-crust pie.</strong> Do some fluting      and/or crimping to make the edge look attractive and to      help it adhere to the rim of the pan. This can be done with      the back of a fork, or by pinching the dough with two      fingers of one hand and bring- a finger or knuckle of the      other hand between them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>For a double-crust pie.</strong> Don't do anything      fancy to the edge quite yet. First, put in your filling,      then bring out your second little cake of dough. Roll it,      drape it around the rolling pin, and unroll it over the      filling. Now trim the edges evenly and crimp or flute them      together. Cut slits or decorative shapes in the top crust      to let steam escape.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BASIC PIE CRUST</strong>    </p>    <p>      Yield: 1 double crust or 2 shells for 9-inch pie<br />      <em>1 3/4 cup flour</em><br />      <em>1 tablespoon sugar (optional)</em><br />      <em>1 teaspoon salt (optional)</em> <em><br /></em> <em>1/4      sticks cold butter or frozen margarine</em><br />      <em>2 tablespoons chilled margarine, vegetable shortening,      or lard</em><br />      <em>3 tablespoons ice water in a measuring cup up with ice      cubes</em>    </p>    <p>      Put the flour (and the salt and sugar, if you're using      them) into a food processor fitted with the metal blade.      Cut both types of fat into 1/2-inch pieces and drop into      the processor. Process for about 3 seconds, until the flour      and fat are barely combined Remove the ice Cubes and pour      the ice water into processor. Process again for 2 or 3      seconds-just until the dough forms a cohesive mass. If the      dough doesn't hold together, add a few more drops of very      cold water and process briefly again.    </p>    <p>      Cut the dough in half, shape each halt into a flat little      cake, wrap well in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill      for 1 to 2 hours, or until fully firm. (The dough will keep      for a week refrigerated and much longer if frozen.)    </p>
