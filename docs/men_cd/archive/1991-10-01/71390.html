                    <h3>      GIFTS FROM THE WOODS    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Susi Jacobson    </h5>        <p>      Between the woods, fields, and roadsides all around us, you      have all the supplies you'll need to create unique natural      wreaths and gifts. I've been collecting my supplies      naturally for eight years and am continually finding      something new that nature has to offer for my creations.      When I forage for natural material, I either go out looking      for a particular item or just walk, looking for what nature      has to offer at that particular time of the year. The more      you walk the woods and fields of your area, the more keen      your eyes become. You'll soon have a place to collect your      vines, another for collecting your nuts, and others still      for your milkweed, moss, and pinecones. (Did I mention that      you'll be walking a lot and getting some great exercise?      What a terrific benefit from this new interest!)    </p>    <p>      Think you may not have room for all this? If you decide to      start collecting nature supplies to create several wreaths      for yourself, plus a couple of gifts for friends, all you      need is an area big enough to hang your dried materials,      room for a couple of trays of nuts, moss, nests, and fungi,      and several cans to store your silica-gel flowers (more on      that later). You'll also need a worktable when you decide      to put a piece together. I often bring dried naturals home      and hang them in the kitchen or on the front porch.    </p>    <p>      When I go on a foraging walk, I take several large baskets      with handles and lots of bags. The baskets are great for      flowers and grasses; the bags work well for moss, nuts,      etc. A friend of mine prefers a nylon bag slung over his      shoulder for everything. Remember    </p>    <p>      your hand clippers, as well as a canvas carpenter's apron      with lots of pockets to store your small collectibles in.    </p>    <p>      Different supply needs will take you to different places.      Looking for vines will take you to wooded roadsides,      usually up or down an embankment (remember to be careful).      If you need some milkweed, Queen Anne's lace, or yarrow, a      large open field is a good source. Moss and fungi are      usually found in the woods near streams or attached to the      undersides of logs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Vines</strong>    </p>		     <p>      The best time to collect vines is in the spring and fall.      Grapevine, bittersweet vine, forsythia, honeysuckle, and      thornless raspberry vines may all be used for wreaths.      Grapevine and bittersweet vine are easy to locate in the      fall, as their leaves are the first to turn yellow. To      remove grapevine and bittersweet vine from a tree, find a      central vine among the hanging mass and tug gently as you      back away from the tree. (The best-size vines are a half      inch in diameter or smaller but using a variety of widths      adds interest to your wreath.) Many vines should come out      in a bunch. Final separation from the tree can be done with      hand clippers. Forsythia, honeysuckle, and raspberry vines      may be easily cut, branch by branch, off the bush. Tie a      rope around the vine mass to put it in your car trunk or      carry it home.    </p>    <p>      With your clippers, divide the vines into seven foot      sections, Picking off bark and scraggly tendrils (the      curlicues). I keep the good tendrils on the vine for a      great woodsy look. Vines should be soaked overnight to      insure flexibility in winding.    </p>    <p>      I have an old bathtub outdoors and soak my vines in      rainwater. You can also use an old washtub, bending vines      in a circle to fit. A good rainy day will soak vines lying      on the ground.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Moss, Fungi, and Wasp's Nests</strong>    </p>        <p>      Sphagnum, lichen, and bun moss are just a few of the      varieties available to pick-all offer different      textures and shades of green. Some will come right up off      the ground in sheets. Stream banks and forest floors are      especially abundant with moss.    </p>    <p>      Larger fungi (called "punk" by some) are easily spotted      growing on trees and old stumps at eye level; smaller      pieces grow underneath fallen trees. The smaller ones can      be gently picked or cut off. These come in various colors      and stripes and add contrast and texture to a wreath.    </p>    <p>      I gather old, vacant wasp's nests in February and March      from the rafters of our barn. (Spray first with a mild      insect repellent if it makes you feel bet ter.) The      honeycomb adds something unexpected to a wreath.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Flowers and Weeds</strong>    </p>    <p>      Goldenrod should be picked just as it turns yellow if you      want the color bright. Pick Queen Anne's lace in full bloom      or dried in the fall.    </p>    <p>      Yarrow, teasels, and grasses may be picked in different      stages in varying shades. Hydrangeas should be picked after      they change color and become slightly dry. Daisies and      thistles should be picked in full bloom and then dried in      silica gel.    </p>    <p>      Cut flowers and weeds at the base of the plant (take gloves      for teasels and thistles). Daisies and Queen Anne's lace      can be plucked off the stem for wreath use.    </p>    <p>      Find acorns, pinecones, and nuts on the forest floor and on      the roads in the fall; save and dry peach, apricot, and      plum seeds at home. Drying your foraged treasures      thoroughly is very important to your final product. Drying      kills any bugs or insects and preserves your material so it      will last.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hang Drying</strong>    </p>        <p>      Hang drying of naturals can be done as easily as hammering      in a couple of nails, tying up a small rope line, or by      using a wooden laundry rack. I use pipe cleaners to wrap      around the end of the flower bunch I'm hanging and then      secure it to the line or rack. Pipe cleaners work well      since your flowers will shrink as they dry, and the      cleaners can be easily adjusted. After blooms have      thoroughly dried, store them in boxes if you don't plan to      use them right away or set the bunches upright in coffee      cans or large vases, Whether the flowers are in the process      of drying or just in storage, make sure the room is dry,      airy, and where things won't be touched or moved.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tray Drying</strong>    </p>    <p>      Nuts, moss, fungi, bird's nests, pinecones, seeds, and bark      should be placed on old cookie trays, screens, newspapers,      or in shallow boxes to dry thoroughly before use. A shelf      in a dry, warm room or out in the sun will do. Depending on      the thickness of the material, these items can take from      several days to several weeks to dry.    </p>    <p>      Pinecones, seeds, nuts, and leaves may also be dried in a      moderately heated oven until they lose all their moisture.    </p>    <p>      Store dried materials in coffee cans, boxes, or baskets,      away from moisture and dampness.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Silica Gel</strong>    </p>    <p>      Not all flowers retain their colors when dried naturally.      The use of silica gel, a sandlike product that thoroughly      and quickly dries natural materials, will preserve original      colors very effectively.    </p>        <p>      I bought a five-pound can of silica gel in 1989 for $16. It      will last me a lifetime. When my foraging year begins, my      silica gel is always in use, from the first spring blossoms      until the last blooms of fall.    </p>    <p>      In the morning, after the dew has dried off the plants (you      want to pick when flowers are as dry as possible), cut a      basket of blooms to be dried. Handling the flower gently,      cut the stem about an inch from the blossom. Pour 1/2 -inch      of silica gel in the bottom of a cookie tin or coffee can      with a tight lid, then place flowers face down, being      careful not to let them touch. Gently pour enough silica      gel to cover flowers entirely, making sure to get the gel      on all sides and between the petals. Then continue adding      layers until the tin is full, making sure the last layer is      silica gel. Cover tightly. More-delicate blossoms can dry      in two to three days. Thicker blossoms can take from one to      10 days or some times more; all depends on the dryness of      the bloom when it's picked and the moisture in the air      while it is drying. Drying your flowers completely is very      important.    </p>    <p>      Remember that reds will dry darker; whites will sometimes      dry translucent or cream-colored. Pinks, yellows, oranges,      blues, greens, and purples will all dry and retain the same      color as when you picked them.    </p>    <p>      When you think the blossoms are dry, gently dig one out and      check. If they are ready to be removed, carefully pour the      silica gel out of the tin, gently picking out your dried      flowers as you go. A small paintbrush is good for removing      sand particles from your flowers. Between usage, store      silica get tightly in its tin can.    </p>    <p>      Silica gel needs to be revived after three to four uses and      even more frequently in rainy weather. When the blue      crystals turn pink, you know it's time to recycle. Pour it      on old cookie sheets about an inch thick and dry in a      325°F oven until the blue color reappears. This will      take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. I open the door      of the oven several times during this reviving process and      wipe away any moisture that builds on the oven door. Return      the gel to its tin and close tightly after it cools.    </p>    <p>      I store my silica-gel dried flowers in cookie tins or      coffee cans and then label them. It's important to keep      moisture away from the tins and to store them in a dry      environment. If the flowers I've dried are thick or the      weather has been rainy, I throw a tablespoon or more of      silica gel in a labeled storage tin of already dried      blossoms to help further absorb moisture.    </p>    <p>      My silica-gel drieds are used in wreaths, pot pourri, and      natural arrangements. After I secure them in a creation, I      spray them lightly with a clear acrylic to help further      block out moisture. I wouldn't put my most delicate      silicagel creations outdoors in harsh weather or direct      sunlight, though I did keep a wreath outdoors last year      through February and March and it held up beautifully. I      urge you to experiment. You'll find silica get so magical      that you'll be waiting impatiently for your first flowers      to come up just so you can start preserving and creating      beautiful things.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Milkweed Pods</strong>    </p>        <p>      My favorite foraged treasure, milkweed pods-dried in      different shades-lend beautiful lines to your work.      They have less tendency to crack if you pick them up in the      summer, when they are still green. Snip the pods off and      leave them in a box or bag for two or three days. This      starts the drying process gradually. Gently split the pods      with your thumbs and remove the insides, being careful not      to damage the flesh of the pod within. Fill a cookie sheet      with empty pods and cook in a 325°F oven until they      start turning yellow, beige, and brown and seem to have      dried completely. This method will give you a gor geous      variety of colors and a long-lasting pod. You can still      pick any pods you see in fall or winter, but they'll tend      to be brittle. Spray your pods with clear acrylic for added      strength and an attractive shine.    </p>    <p>      Once you've collected and dried whatever caught your eye on      your walks through the woods, you'll want to show off your      bounty.    </p>    <p>      The following project-a vine wreath with milkweedpod      flowers-is excellent for first time wreath makers.      It's a great conversation piece ("Is that really a wasp's      nest?"), and its natural beauty blends in with almost any      decor. And as you'll be gathering your own materials, the      price will be more than reasonable.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Natural Vine Wreath With Milkweed-Pod      Flowers</strong>    </p>    <p>      Makes one 12-inch wreath.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Supplies needed:</strong>    </p>        <p>      15 to 20 7-foot lengths of grapevine (I used grapevine but      the vines mentioned are fine)<br />      16 cooked milkweed pods (see previous instructions) Make      sure these materials are dried before using:<br />      2 large pieces of sphagnum moss<br />      10 hemlock pinecones<br />      15 stems of goldenrod<br />      15 stems of green oats<br />      15 stems of white yarrow<br />      25 heads of Queen Anne's lace<br />      4 small teasels<br />      6 sensitive ferns<br />      4 small wasp's nests<br />      6 small fungi<br />      4 bee-balm centers<br />      Assorted nuts, acorns, and seeds for accent<br />      6 yellow or orange strawflowers<br />      10 yellow marigolds<br />      8 orange marigolds<br />      (The last three items I grow in my garden and silica-gel      dry.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Other Supplies:</strong>    </p>    <p>      15 strands of natural-color raffia<br />      Hot-glue gun<br />      8 hot-glue sticks<br />      Hand clippers<br />      Clear acrylic spray    </p>    <p>      <strong>Instructions for vine base:</strong>    </p>                <p>      1. Soak grapevine sections overnight.    </p>    <p>      2. Starting with one vine length, gently ease it into a      circle, intertwining the ends as you would tie something,      leaving both ends sticking out. (Don't clip ends until you      have four or five vines wound; there will be some give in      the beginning.) Take your second vine and tuck one end      under the first vine (anywhere). Weave the vine over and      then under the first vine until it's completely wound      around. Continue weaving over and under with each vine.      Take a look at your wreath as you add more, checking the      shape for roundness. You may have one side looking fuller      than the other-the less-full side is where you should      be weaving in more vines.    </p>    <p>      3. Wind all your vines, peeling the bark off if you desire,      cutting or leaving the tendrils. Trim any ends of vines      sticking out.    </p>    <p>      4. Thoroughly dry your finished base either in the sun or      near your heater before you decorate. (The glue won't work      on a wet base.) Note: If a vine snaps or breaks while      winding, don't be discouraged. Almost all of my first-time      students get a snap on their first try at winding. It comes      easily after a few attempts. Find another vine and try      again. Some breaks don't even have to be removed from the      base; they can be intertwined not to show. If all your      vines are snapping, then they need more soaking.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Instructions for milkweed flowers:</strong>    </p>    <p>      1. Cook 16 milkweed pods (see previous instructions). Let      cool.    </p>    <p>      2. Arrange four pods in a star formation with their pod      bases meeting in the middle of the wreath.    </p>    <p>      3. Apply glue to the side of one pod near the bottom and      hold together with adjacent pod for 1 minute or until      they're glued together. Apply glue to the bottom side of      the second pod and hold with third pod for another minute.      Apply glue to the fourth pod on both bottom sides and hold      in the last slot until dry. Glue hemlock pinecone in the      center.    </p>    <p>      4. After all four are made, spray with clear acrylic for      shine and strength.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Instructions for decorating the base:</strong>    </p>    <p>      1. Arrange four milkweed flowers on the right side of your      vine base, spacing them evenly.    </p>    <p>      2. One at a time, check first to see where each milkweed      flower touches the base; then glue at these points. Glue      all four flowers in place.    </p>    <p>      3. Where your line of milkweed flowers ends at the top and      bottom of your wreath, glue sphagnum moss for about 6 more      inches. This will serve as a base to glue your drieds to.      You'll be leaving part of your vine base exposed. (Since      you worked so hard on it, I think it's nice for people to      see it.) It will also be where you stick your bow later on.    </p>    <p>      4. Plan to use half your dried material on one area of      moss, the second half for the other. Put aside five or six      Queen Anne's lace heads, three pieces of yarrow, some oats,      and three or four marigolds for filling in between the      milkweed pods.    </p>    <p>      5. It's easiest to concentrate on one moss section at a      time. Start with four 3-inch pieces of goldenrod; space      them equally around and glue them to the mos-one at      the end, two sticking out of the side, and one toward the      middle of the wreath. Now take four pieces of oats and glue      in between the goldenrod, spacing evenly. (Basically,      decorating a wreath is learning to fill in one area at a      time.) Next, take some yarrow and add. Your area should be      starting to fill in somewhat. If there are gaps or holes,      fill in with an extra piece or two of yarrow.    </p>    <p>      6. Trim off the stems of your teasels and glue on the top      part of the moss, the other toward the end closer to the      milkweed. Glue in several small pieces of fungi, sensitive      ferns, and bee-balm middles. Make sure things are spaced      around evenly.    </p>    <p>      7. Take three orange marigolds and two strawflowers and      arrange them so the color is distributed evenly. Glue them      down.    </p>    <p>      8. Add any nuts, seeds, and wasp's nests you might want to      use.    </p>    <p>      9. Now stand back and take a look at what you've done thus      far. (You shouldn't be able to see any shape problems or      holes when you're right on top of the wreath. Standing back      for a minute and getting a good perspective is important in      producing a professional-looking wreath.) Queen Anne's lace      is a super filler, so-still staying in one section-fill any      holes, even up the inner or outer sides, and add another      piece of color if needed. Now stand back again and you      should have your one section full and finished.    </p>    <p>      10. For your second moss section, follow the exact same      procedures as you did with the first (steps 5 through 9).    </p>    <p>      11. Take the Queen Anne's lace, oats, and yarrow you set      aside and fill in between the milkweed flowers.    </p>    <p>      12. Stand back and look. The entire decorated side of your      wreath should have an evenness to it. You may find a need      to fill in here or there or a need for more color in      places. Trust your own judgment and add whatever is needed.    </p>    <p>      13. The final touch is a raffia bow. Raffia looks super      with all natural work. Taking all your raffia strands with      one hand, find the midway point. Make a loop to one side;      then take the bow and wrap it around the loop and pull it      through the knot. Even out the loops and trim the raffia      ends so they are also even. Glue your bow securely to the      middle of the exposed base of the vines.    </p>    <p>      14. Lightly spray the dried-flower sections with clear      acrylic.    </p>    <p>      Congratulations on completing your wreath! I'll bet you did      a lot better than you thought you would. You probably even      surprised yourself by how beautiful it looks.    </p>    <p>      I'm also sure you have more creative ideas on other natural      wreaths you want to make. It's time to take another walk,      cut some different vines, and go out looking for more      unique natural materials. Maybe try tying the bow on the      bottom or the top of the wreath next time; even no bow at      all looks great sometimes. Plan to cover the entire wreath      base next time and use it as a centerpiece. This is      particularly beautiful when combined with seasonal,      freshcut flowers.    </p>    <p>      I'm always making two wreaths in my mind as I'm finishing      up one. But that's hardly a problem, because these lovingly      made natural wreaths make unique gifts all year round. Your      friends will really appreciate a present that comes from      your own two hands (with a little help from Mother Earth).    </p>    <p>      The abundance of natural material to be foraged and used,      plus the ever-changing textures and combinations that the      fall season provides, never fails to get me excited about      creating with nature. So gather some baskets, take a walk,      and just think of all the possibilities.    </p>    <p>      <em>Susi Jacobson hasforaged, created, and sold natural      wreaths for eight years in rural Munster Pennsylva</em>      <em>nia, alongside the woodcarver Tom McCarty and</em>      <em>their daughter Holly.
