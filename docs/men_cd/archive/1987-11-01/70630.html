            		<p> SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</p>          <h5 id="byline">      By Greg and Pat Williams    </h5><p><strong>Foam away frost?</strong> According to East    German experiments, an eight-inch layer of nontoxic,    biodegradable foam protects strawberry, tomato, bean and    potato plants from several hours of subfreezing temperatures    (even down into the teens). The product is not yet    commercially available.</p>        <p>      <strong>Stretchy tree paint.</strong>Tree-Max, a paint      specially formulated to protect the trunks and lower      branches of fruit trees from sun scald, contains an elastic      material that allows it to stretch and grow with the tree.      The permeable paint is available from Associated Technical      Consultants, 352 Morris St., Toledo, OH 43602.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Freeze herb pests.</strong> Dr. A.D. Tucker of the      Delaware State College Herbarium says that freezing      harvested herbs for 48 hours at 0°F should kill all      insect pests and egg clusters. Dried-on-the-vine raisins      are now feasible, at least in fairly arid regions. For      details, write to H.E. Studer (Dept. of Agricultural      Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA 95616) for      a copy of his paper, "Raisin Production by Natural On      the-Vine Drying."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Death to multiflora rose</strong> . If you've ever      struggled against that invasive briar, multiflora rose,      you'll be glad to hear about rose rosette. This disease      causes deformed stems, altered leaflet development and      bright red spring shoots one year-and kills the      entire plant the next!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cool compost, please</strong> . According to      research at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development      Center, soil mixes containing materials composted at      moderate temperatures can help suppress damping off of      seedlings. However, compost cooked at high 'temperatures      (above 140°F) can actually pro mote such fungus      diseases. Apparently, the beneficial microorganisms that      attack damp ing off are killed by the higher temperatures.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Thank you, tropics.</strong> Most bean varieties      are rather poor nitrogen fixers. But horticulturist      Frederick Bliss at the University of Wisconsin has      developed new kidney, pinto and white northern cultivars      that can fix up to 50 pounds of nitrogen per acre (the      equivalent of over 100 pounds of applied N per acre). Bliss      crossed commercial cultivars with native beans obtained      from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in      Cali, Colombia.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sprouts need calcium, too.</strong> Canadian      researchers have found that adding just about 1/4 teaspoon      of calcium chloride (available at drugstores) to every      gallon of water used to rinse mung bean sprouts can delay      stem collapse and decay for up to a week after germination.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Urban garbage goodies.</strong> Seattle is      promoting composting as the least expensive way to recycle      household organic wastes. The program includes literature,      demonstration sites, a master composter's      program-even a composting hotline. For more      information about community compost education programs,      contact the Seattle Solid Waste Utility, 710 2nd Ave.,      Suite 750, Seattle, WA 98104.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gleanings.</strong>    </p>        <p>      In cooperation with the Natural Organic Farmers      Association, the New Hampshire Cooperative Extension      Service (College of Life Science and Agriculture, Taylor      Hall, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824) has      published a free extension bulletin titled "Pest Control      for Organic Vegetable Growing." . . . Flower-pressing      supplies, booklets and kits are available from BJG      Associates, Box 463, Edgemont, PA 19028 (free brochure)      .... Guardian is the first biological insect control      product that uses beneficial nematodes to control pest      insects inside greenhouses. Look for it in garden stores      soon .... The best source for books about growing and using      herbs is Only Herbs, 1936 Greenwood Lake Tpk., Hewitt, NJ      07421 (send $1 and a long SASE for a catalogue).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Limas and Loopers</strong>    </p>        <p>      They grow faster and they get eaten faster. That sums up      the findings of entomologists at the University of      California, Riverside, who grew lima beans under conditions      of elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and then      introduced cabbage loopers.' The motivation for this      research is the continuing increase (about 0.3°70 per      year) in the concentration of global atmospheric capon,      dioxide, mainly due to the combustion of fossil fuels.      Agricultural and horticultural researchers expect the      increased carbon dioxide concentration to affect plant      productivity, but they aren't sure to what extent.      Theoretically, more carbon dioxide should result in faster      plant growth. It should also reduce the ratio of nitrogen      to carbon in plant leaves, so that animal and insect      herbivores will have to eat more of the leaves to get the      same nutritional value.    </p>    <p>      The California research results agree with the theoretical      predictions: With more carbon dioxide, lima bean plants      grew faster and were eaten faster by cabbage loopers. In      fact, the extra growth was about offset by the extra looper      feeding. It looks like we might be headed for a frenzy of      accelerated crop production and consumption.    </p>    <p>      <em>Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their food on a      small farm and publish</em> <em>Hort-Ideas, a fine      newsletter on gardening research and products ($10 a year      from G. & P.
