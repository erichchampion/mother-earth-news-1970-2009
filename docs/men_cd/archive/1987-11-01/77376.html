                    <p>      <strong>Freezes don't faze our readers.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>WINTER</strong><strong>WISDOM</strong>    </p>    <p>      Ice storms are fairly common here in the Northeast. After a      particularly fierce one, I awoke the next morning to a      beautiful frosty world. Crystals glistened on the limbs of      trees, atop power lines and fences . . . and in the locks      of my car doors. For two hours I laboriously followed the      advice of sympathetic neighbors: Heat the key, squirt      graphite into the lock, spray in rubbing alcohol, melt the      ice with a hair dryer. Finally, one of these methods (or      perhaps a combination of them) worked. But I got an idea      from one neighbor who bemoaned the fact that cars no longer      come equipped with little metal tabs protecting the locks.      I now carry a roll of masking tape in my car, and whenever      the weather threatens, I stick a small piece of tape over      each lock and haven't had a problem since.<br />      <br />      <em>Jean Schuler<br />      Whitestone, New York</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Salad Surprise</strong><br />      <br />      At summer's end I can the last of our wonderful      vine-ripened tomatoes; after that our fresh salads have to      make do with pale, tasteless tomatoes from the supermarket.      That is, they did till I made an accidental discovery. One      evening, as I was using my canned tomatoes in a casserole,      I decided to see what would happen if I poured the juice      over those bland wedges awaiting the salad greens. It was      amazing. After about 15 minutes the cold-storage tomatoes      tasted like they were fresh from a sunny garden.<br />      <br />      <em>Bettye Kelly<br />      Kingsville, Texas</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Score One for the Birds</strong>    </p>    <p>      My mother figured how to keep squirrels off the bird      feeder. She took a length of heavy wire, strung it with      empty thread spools and stretched it between two trees. The      feeder hangs in the middle, and no animal can walk across      those spinning spools.    </p>    <p>      Nancy Carey<br />      Glens Falls, New York    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Tonic for Your Tree</strong>    </p>    <p>      I decorate my Christmas tree in early December, and though      I don't take it down till mid-January, it doesn't shed its      needles but stays fresh and green. Lots of people mix sugar      or aspirin into the water in the tree stand, but my formula      works better. To a gallon of water I add two cups of white      Karo syrup, one cup of Listerine and four ground-up      multivitamin-with-iron tablets. I make up about two gallons      of this solution, stirring it well. Then, after sawing a      half-inch off the stub of the trunk to help it absorb      nutrients, I place the tree in the stand. After filling the      bowl of the stand with the tonic, I check the amount every      other day or so, and add more as necessary. I've used this      method for years, and I never worry about my trees drying      out.    </p>    <p>      <em>Joseph Zsiga<br />      Rock Hill, South Carolina</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Foiling a Frolic</strong>    </p>        <p>      Our kitten loved to jump up into the Christmas tree,      batting at balls and getting tangled in the tinsel. This      was cute to watch, but our decorations were taking a      beating. Knowing that garlic repels cats, we placed a few      pieces of a fresh, peeled clove under the tree skirt. Our      human noses couldn't detect the slightest odor, but Kitty      decided to play elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      <em>Roger T. Finley<br />      Lomira, Wisconsin</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Boomer's Bonnet</strong>    </p>    <p>      Though a shed protected our poultry from bitter winds, one      harsh, blustery, Illinois winter was particularly hard on      our roosters. Their combs were frostbitten and started      turning black around the edges. Pitiful! I cut an old,      blue-flowered shower cap with a terrycloth lining into      eight circles, then stitched elastic around the rims. These      caplets were slipped over the combs of eight struggling,      squawking roosters, but after a bit of head shaking and      scratching, they accepted them gratefully. (I could almost      hear the hens snicker.) Boomer liked his so much he wore it      well into spring. We had a mad chase through the crocuses      and daffodils when I finally took it of!    </p>    <p>      <em>Polly Cooper<br />      Savannah, Georgia</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Is Your Chihuahua Chilly?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many small dogs really do need sweaters to go out in winter      weather. Those from pet stores tend to be expensive, but      very satisfactory substitutes can be found in the infant      and toddler sections of department stores. Zippered      sweaters are best (just turn the garment around and zip it      up the back of the dog). It's easy to find the correct size      for your pooch, and you can take advantage of sales to      further reduce the cost.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dorothea Warner<br />      Groton, Connecticut</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Firewood Bonanza</strong>    </p>    <p>      I heat with wood but don't have my own lot to cut from. As      the cost from suppliers in this city is very high, I looked      for an alternative. A local tree service employee told me      where they dumped their "refuse." And when I went there, I      found that at least 10 other such enterprises used the same      landfill. Right at hand were some 10 cords of oak, red oak      and maple, all cut to two-foot lengths. Paying just $1 per      visit gate fee, I loaded my van with several winters' worth      of virtually free heat.    </p>    <p>      <em>Stephen Brown<br />      Birmingham, Alabama</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Traction Trick</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many of us don't enjoy hauling a 50-pound sack of sand      around in our car's trunk to help us get moving on ice and      snow. For years I've carried a couple of boxes of table      salt for the same purpose. They don't add significant      weight in the rear, of course, but they can provide      traction when the tires start to spin. I simply pour a      boxful directly in front of and behind each rear tire (do      the front tires for front-wheel drive). By the time I get      back into the car, I'm able to drive away. It's worked      every time.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dolores Anderson<br />      Levittown, Pennsylvania</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Traction Trick II</strong>    </p>    <p>      After rinsing out and thoroughly drying one of those large      plastic jugs that contain liquid or granular laundry      detergent, I fill it with dry sand. I carry it in the trunk      of my car to sprinkle on ice and snow in case I get stuck.    </p>    <p>      <em>Ernie Soliday<br />      St. James, Minnesota</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Money to Burn</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's an inexpensive gift to make for friends with      fireplaces, woodstoves or charcoal grills. Collect a supply      of paper play money and some sawdust or cedar chips, then      melt a cup or so of paraffin or candle stubs. Roll each      paper bill into a tube, using tape to hold its shape. Pour      enough wax onto the sawdust or chips to make a sticky mass,      and stuff the mixture into the cylinders. A small basket      filled with neat rolls of "10s and 20s," and perhaps tied      with a bow or sprig of holly, is both attractive and      functional. Since they're waterproof, these fire starters      are also an easy-to-carry source of emergency heat for      camping, hiking, ice fishing and such.    </p>    <p>      <em>Mikki Smith<br />      Lexington, Michigan</em>    </p>
