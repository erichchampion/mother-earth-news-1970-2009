        1. Madagascar dragon tree (Dracaena marginata): A popular lily, this hardy, bushlike ornamental can slowly grow to 16 feet high. Its slender, cane like stems are topped with shiny, red-margined leaves. For best results, keep it in a small container. 2.Dumb cane (Dieffenbachia picta): This tropical American native is prized for its ornamental variegated leaves on tall growing, thick green canes. Dumb cane earned its name because the noxious sap in its stem causes pain and swelling when swallowed. 3.Lady palm (Rhapis excelsa): This reliable fan palm carries bamboolike canes and glossy, dark green, leathery leaves. The versatile lady adapts to warm and cool temperatures alike. 4. Asparagus fern (Asparagus setaceus or plumosus): This lacy, fernlike lily family member bears wiry stems with flattened fronds carrying fine, hairlike greenery. It makes a long lasting, luxurious basket plant. The related Sprengeri fern (A. densiflorus`Sprengeri') has a fluffier appearance. 5.Striped dracaena (Dracaena deremensis warneekeii'): Long, sword -shaped, leathery leaves with white center stripes grow from a thick, tall-growing cane. This durable dracaena does well in dry environments. 6. Grape ivy (Cissusrhombifolia): The long, bending branches of this vine sport deep green, wavy-toothed leaflets. The cascading rambler forms a lush, decorative plant for baskets or trellised pots. Pinch it back occasionally to promote denser growth. 7. Spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum): Long, wiry, flowering stalks cascade spiderlike from the pot, forming little airborne plantlets that give the spider its alternative name: the airplane plant. The ivory-banded basket plant adapts well to cool temperatures. 8. Umbrella tree(Brassaia actinophylla): The familiar umbrella, or schefflera, is admired for the grand rosette produced by its compound leaves. The fastgrowing aralia makes an excellent tall-growing tub plant. But it dislikes drafts and is very sensitive to overwatering, so keep it warm and let it dry well between waterings. 9. Devil's ivy (Scindapsus aureus): A popular philodendron cousin (also known as pothos or hunter's-robe), devil's ivy is a green, fleshy viner suitable for basket or trellis culture. (The popular cultivar `Marble Queen' has regal white variegation.) It relishes warmth and likes to go dry between waterings.
