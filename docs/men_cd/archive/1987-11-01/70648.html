                        <p>      <em>With "8-power"vision and 70 mph legs, the pronghorn is      an American wonder.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By David Petersen    </h5>    <p>      <strong>The pronghorn's comeback is among the most dramatic      in history.</strong><br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      Hanging from the walls or resting on the mantel in the      front room of my cabin are the antlers and horns of a      variety of wild North American ungulates. Some are attached      pairs, others individual beams. None are from animals I      have killed myself. A few I picked up from the forest floor      during backcountry hikes, others I bartered from friends      who bagged them in such unromantic locales as flea markets      and garage sales. Their origins don't matter so much to me;      they aren't trophies; it's simply their forms I fancy.    </p>    <p>      There are some unusual and attractive specimens in my      little collection, including a beautifully formed 4x5-point      rack from a relatively rare Tule elk.But the most      interesting piece of ungulate headgear I own is also the      least impressive at first glance. Leaned up against the      wall at the back of the mantel, its modest form fairly      hidden behind a dusty potpourri of flint projectile points,      elk teeth and the skulls of various rodents and birds,      rests a small black horn from a male pronghorn antelope.    </p>    <p>      The interesting thing about this horn, and pronghorn horn      in general, is its uniqueness: It's not antler, nor is it      horn as we commonly know it, but it claims some of the      characteristics of both.    </p>    <p>      Although the terms <em>antler and</em> <em>horn</em> are      frequently used interchangeably in casual conversation,      each refers to a distinct type of ungulate headgear.      Consider these four differences: While mature antler is      solid, dead, bloodless bone, horn consists of an outer      sheath composed of keratin (a hard epidermal tissue of the      type that forms hooves, claws and fingernails in mammals)      wrapped around a porous, living, blood-filled core. While      antlers are deciduous (that is, they're cast off and      regrown annually), horns are never shed, with the      original-issue models remaining on the job for the life of      their host. While mature antlers are always bifurcated, or      branched, horns are almost always simple unforked shafts.      While it's highly unusual for antlers to appear on females      (except caribou), horns are commonly grown by both sexes.    </p>    <p>      And now we come to the unique horns of the pronghorn.    </p>        <p>      Unique pronghorn horn characteristic No. 1: The pronghorn      is the only ungulate to grow headgear that's classified as      horn but which is forked-sort of. A mature pronghorn      buck will have horns a foot or more in length (up to a      maximum of 20 inches or so), with the tips curled back      (enabling rutsparring bucks to strike up into the      vulnerable throats of their rivals) and each with a single      flat prong, called the cutter, jutting forward from about      midway up the shaft (and serving much like the hilt on a      sword, to catch and stop the thrusting horn of a rival).      Does of the species sometimes have much smaller horns.    </p>    <p>      Unique pronghorn horn characteristic No. 2: The pronghorn      is the only ungulate to grow headgear that's classified as      horn but which is deciduous-sort of. Each year,      between late October and early December, pronghorn bucks      shed the outer sheaths of their horns while retaining the      slender inner cores, around which new sheaths have already      begun to form. (In fact, the outward and upward pressure      exerted by the growing sheaths helps to loosen the old      sheaths.)    </p>    <p>      Unique pronghorn horh characteristic No. 3: hairy horns. On      my desk before me now I have the pronghorn horn from my      collection (a specimen I obtained, to my wife's disgust, by      carving it from the crushed skull of a truckstruck buck      alongside a remote Western byway several years ago). An      inspection of the base of the horn reveals three distinct      layers in cross section. The core, as with all horn, is      porous bone marrow. Around this core is wrapped a layer of      tough, white, cartilaginous tissue. The third, or outer      layer looks a lot like thick hairs stuck together with      black glue and hardened. Of course, as with most things in      life, there's more to it than meets the eye.    </p>    <p>      The exterior of the horn I have here has a rough, barklike      texture except at the tip, which the buck had polished      smooth before his untimely demise. Under a magnifying      glass, individual, unfused blond hairs can be seen      protruding from the hardened black surface, more so near      the base, making for, in appearance at least, a hirsute      horn. What doesn't meet the eye is the fact that the bulk      of the hairy-looking sheath is composed, not of fused hair,      but of cornified, or hardened, tissue called epithelium.    </p>    <p>      The pronghorn is unique in more than its horns. Giving the      lie to its scientific name,    </p>    <p>      <em>Antilocapra americana</em> -literally, "American      antelope-goat"-the pronghorn in fact is no antelope      at all, nor a goat (though it is commonly called a prairie      goat by Westerners), but a unique, exclusively American      animal (length of residency: 20 million years) with no      close relatives of any sort anywhere on earth. Further,      it's the sole genus in its scientific family,      Antilocapridae, and the sole living species in its genus.      (As opposed, say, to the deer family, Cervidae, which      comprises deer, elk, caribou and moose in North America      alone.)    </p>    <p>      An exceptionally large pronghorn buck might weigh as much      as 140 pounds, but the average is closer to 110; does run      about 10% lighter. The typical pronghorn stands to around      36 inches at the shoulders and is perhaps 52 inches in      length. The backs and upper sides of adults are tan to      russet, accented with thick dark manes, black facial      markings (on bucks only) and white belly, rump and throat      bands. The white rump is part of yet another unique      attribute of the pronghorn.    </p>    <p>      In the third volume of his classic <em>Lives of Game      Animals</em> , turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest      Thompson Seton details how he determined, through physical      examination and dissection of dead zoo specimens as well as      lengthy observation of the living, that the pronghorn uses      its hoary posterior as a unique means of communication:    </p>    <p>      "[The white rump] seems at first like the rest of his      spots-a mere patch of white coat; but it is found to      be specialized for an important service. It is composed of      hair graded from short in the centre, to long at the front      edges. Under the skin of the part is a circular muscle by      means of which the hair can, in a moment, be raised and      spread radially into two great blooming twin      chrysanthemums, more or less flattened at the centre. When      this is done in the bright sunlight, they shine like tin      pans, giving flashes of light that can be seen farther than      the animal itself, affording a conspicuous identification      mark that must be of great service to the species.    </p>    <p>      " Seton goes on to explain that the first pronghorn in a      herd to spot potential danger will flash a warning,      simultaneously releasing a musky scent. These dual alarms      are quickly picked up by the rest of the animals, each of      which duplicates the alerts so that, in an instant, the      entire band is warned and on the lookout.    </p>    <p>      In pre-Columbian times, the pronghorn was one of the most      plentiful, possibly the most plentiful, of the ungulates      roaming North America, sharing the vast native grasslands      of Western and mid-America with the bison and ranging as      far east as the Mississippi River Valley. Seton once      estimated that in primitive times North America may have      hosted as many as 20 million pronghorns, but later      discounted that figure, deciding that it was "a very      low-a-far too low-estimate." An earlier      researcher-publisher, naturalist, ethnologist arid      Audubon Society founder Dr. George Bird      Grinnell-speculated that pronghorns might even have      outnumbered bison, which are thought to have been some 40      million strong around 1800. In 1908, the U.S. Biological      Survey esti mated that no more than 20,000 pronghorns      remained in all of Canada and the contiguous 48 states. But      the low point was yet to come: By 1915, the total had      dwindled to under 15,000. Miraculously, by the early 1920s,      primarily because of a total ban on pronghorn hunting      nationwide and the establishment of game preserves, the      population had more than doubled to an estimated 30,326,      including Canada and Mexico (Nelson, 1924).    </p>    <p>      Today, depending on where you live and travel, the      pronghorn can be plentiful enough to be considered an      agricultural pest and a hazard to nighttime motoring (near      Casper, Wyoming, for example, it's common to see      trophy-size bucks lying within yards of busy highways,      insouciantly chewing cud while big diesel rigs scream      by)-or can be an almost mythological creature whose      name you may have heard in corny old cowboy songs but which      you aren't likely to see outside a zoo. Pronghorn country      is dry country, much of it desert.    </p>    <p>      Where surface water is available, pronghorns will troop in      to drink deeply at least once a day. Where surface water is      insufficient or nonexistent, the remarkable animals      apparently can wring enough moisture to survive from      cactus, which plants can account for more than 10% of their      total diet, the rest consisting of grasses, forbs and      browse. The pronghorn, as an old-line denizen of the      treeless plains, prairies and deserts, has evolved to rely,      not on the natural camouflage and stealth employed by deer      and elk to keep themselves out of harm's way, but rather on      its exceptional speed and vision. On September 17,1804, on      the westbound leg of his long trek to the Pacific with      William Clark, while traveling through what today is South      Dakota, Captain Meriwether Lewis recorded in his journal      the following observations (the creative spelling,      punctuation and capitalization are his):    </p>    <p>      "I had this day an opportunity of witnessing the agility      and the superior fleetness of [the antelope] .... I had      pursued and twice surprised a small herd of seven . . .      [and] got within about 200 paces of them when they smelt me      and fled; I gained the top of the eminence on which they      stood, as soon as possible from whence I had an extensive      view of the country.. . the antelopes which had disappeared      in a steep reveene now appeared at the distance of about      three miles on the side of a ridge .... so soon had these      antelopes gained the distance at which they had again      appeared to my view I doubted at ferst that they were the      same that I had just surprised, but my doubts soon vanished      when I beheld the rapidity of their flight along the ridge      before me . . . it appeared reather the rappid flight of      birds than the motion of quadrupeds. I think I can safely      venture the asscertion that the speed of this animal is      equal if not superior to that of the finest blooded      courser."    </p>    <p>      Well, yes, Cap'n, at the least: A prime buck pronghorn was      clocked in the 1940s by a researcher-an      unquestionably credible reporter who paced the animal in an      automobile-at more than 61 miles per hour. That is,      the car was doing 61 per when the pronghorn passed it. More      recent clockings have exceeded even this, with one report      claiming 70 miles per hour. Such speeds, of course, were      attained in brief sprints; in the long run, a pronghorn can      maintain more or less 40 miles per hour, mile after mile,      hour after hour. The best racehorses can approach that      speed but, lacking the pronghorn's stamina, will blow gut      early on. In short, the pronghorn is the swiftest mammal      native to North America, the swiftest mammal in the      Northern Hemisphere and the second-swiftest mammal in the      world, following close on the heels of the cheetah (which      it will overtake and pass after the cat's limited endurance      plays out).    </p>    <p>      The most colorful description I've seen of the pronghorn's      visual acuity was reported in 1890 by Arthur W. DuBray and      retold in <em>Animals of the World</em> (1917):    </p>    <p>      "`Liver-eating Johnson,' guide, scout, hunter and trapper,      prairie-man, Indian fighter, thoroughly educated and      equipped frontiersman at every point, graduate at the head      of his class in prairie lore-withal, a long-headed,      cool, and calculating man-once said to me while      hunting: `What a live Antelope don't see between dawn and      dark, isn't visible from his standpoint; and while you're      a-gawkin' at him through that 'ere glass to make out      whether he's a rock or a Goat, he's acountin' your      cartridges and fixin's, and makin' up his mind which way      he'll scoot when you disappear in the draw for to sneak up      on 'im-and don't you ferget it.' "    </p>    <p>      Tolling, also called flagging, will sometimes lure in a      wary buck.    </p>    			    <p>      In less colorful but more precise words, the pronghorn's      big, black, long-lashed, protuberant eyes give it almost      complete wraparound vision and a magnification long hailed      as equal or superior to what you and I can see with the aid      of 8X binoculars. (Although I'm not sure how this      determination was arrived at.)    </p>    <p>      Given such amazing vision and speed, plus miles and miles      of miles across which to see and flee, the pronghorn's      security would seem almost invincible. But both Meriwether      Lewis and Liver-Eating Johnson (who, incidentally, was the      flesh-and-blood mountain man on whose life and considerable      legend the Robert Redford movie Jeremi ah Johnson was      based; the livers he purportedly ate were those of his      slain enemies) knew that the pronghorn had one fatal flaw      in its defenses: curiosity. Noting this, early white      hunters borrowed from the Indians a technique for using the      pronghorn's unbounded curiosity to lure it to within rifle      range. Lewis called the trick "tolling," while the      liver-eater knew it as "flagging.    </p>    <p>      " By either name, the caper required the hunter, after      spotting the distant white specks that mean pronghorn on      the prairie, to secrete himself in good cover, most often a      ravine or a clump of sagebrush. He would then attach a      brightly colored scarf to a long pole or the muzzle of his      rifle and wave it furiously overhead-or simply lie on      his back and kick his feet in the air. Spotting the      movement from a great distance, the fatally curious animals      would ease ever closer to the wondrous enticement. Whatever      could this odd dancing thing be? When the animals were      within range, the hunter took up his rifle and, if his aim      was true, had meat for the camp pot. (Which meat, by the      way, is-if the animal is killed cleanly and quickly      cooled-tender and delicious, tasting to me like a      cross between lamb and elk.) Savvy wildlife photographers      today use the same trick to entice shy 'lopes into camera      range.    </p>        <p>      It's just as well for pronghorns that they are such timid      creatures, for there are those who would have them for      dinner, and others who would exterminate them as pests.    </p>    <p>      Foremost among the pronghorn's natural enemies is deep      snow, which slows and can even halt the small-hooved      animal's escape from predators, buries his food and      generally makes life miserable. Parasites and disease also      take their toll. Important predators historically included      mountain lions and bobcats, bears, wolves, coyotes and      golden eagles (baldies prefer angling to hunting). Today,      coyotes-which know to run a prong horn in relays      until the sly dogs tucker out their far swifter      prey-still take the odd animal, and the golden eagle      remains a threat to newborn kids. Wolves, bears and      mountain lions, however, have fairly been extirpated across      the pronghorn's vast arid range, much of the "wild" in the      once-Wild West disappearing with them.    </p>    <p>      The pronghorn's primary enemies these days are you and I.      Although unrestrained hunting was a significant      contributing factor to the pronghorn's near-demise around      the turn of the century, modern, well managed hunting is      rarely a threat to any species of big-game animal in      America. In fact, it's in large part the money raised      through the sale of hunting licenses and special taxes on      hunting-related gear that have made possible the successful      management programs that have brought pronghorn (and other      large ungulate species) back from the brink in recent      decades.    </p>    <p>      No, it's not our hunting, but our real estate development      and agricultural endeavors-our houses and cities and      highways and parking lots and shopping malls and livestock      and fences and plowed fields and overgrazed rangelands and      sheer, unrestrained numbers-that threaten the future      of this wild creature and others.    </p>    <p>      So take advantage of the plentitude while you can. If      you've not seen pronghorns bounding with birdlike grace      across plain, prairie or desert, try to, soon. Your three      best bets are Teton and Yellow-stone national parks, both      in northwestern Wyoming, and the National Bison Range in      western Montana. The animals on these refuges, their      natural timidity buffered by long and proximate association      with unarmed humans, often will allow you to approach to      within Instamatic range-a real bonus for those      observers lacking SLR cameras and telephoto lenses but      wanting something more to take home than photos that      require you to explain, "See, Fred, it's them little dots      a'way out there.    </p>    <p>      "But go carefully when driving at night across those vast      Western ranges-"where the bufalo roam and the deer      and the antelope play"-else you might find your      vehicle wearing a pair of those unique pronghorn horns as a      hood ornament or, more disconcerting yet, wind up sharing      the driver's seat with a prairie goat companion.    </p>
