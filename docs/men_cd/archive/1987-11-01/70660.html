                    <p>      How to expand your living space using subtraction, not      addition.    </p>        <p>      Walls might be unwanted for any one of several reasons. For      one owner, a room, hallway or closet might comfortably be      sacrificed in the quest for an open floor plan. For      another, an existing doorway could easily give way to a      full-fledged entrance. And should the search for space go      beyond the house into a finished garage or porch, a wall      will have to be opened somewhere to provide access.    </p>    <p>      If the thought sounds intimidating, that's probably because      it <em>should</em> be. Most walls are significant to a      home's structural integrity, and removing one without      providing an appropriate substitute is a standing      invitation to worry. Fortunately, there are standard      methods for safely spanning just about any opening, and      most involve nothing more than a willingness to understand      basic framing carpentry.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>WALLS<br /></em></strong> <em><strong>The idea      should be a little intimidating.</strong></em><br />      <strong>The Way of the Wall</strong>    </p>    <p>      For our purposes, walls come in two varieties: bearing and      nonbearing. The first, and most important, transfer live      loads (the weight of people, furniture and snow) and dead      loads (the weight of a building's construction materials)      vertically downward to the structure's foundation and      footings. The second type is merely a partition that      supports no load other than its own weight. Nonbearing      walls are of little significance if your home is      structurally sound.    </p>    <p>      Typically, a bearing wall looks like the "before" version      of our main illustration. At the base, it's supported by      rows of horizontal floor joists running at right angles to      its length. Those joists in turn rest on either a girder or      a masonry foundation wall. The upper surface of the joists      is covered with plank or plywood subflooring, and the wall      rests upon that. It consists of a single soleplate, a      series of vertical studs placed 16" on center (24" for 2 X      6s) and a double top plate. The joists for the second floor      or ceiling above are nailed to the top plate over each      stud.    </p>    <p>      Before thinking about actually removing a wall, it's      essential that you assess the structure's framing. Get your      hands on some old clothes and a 25' locking tape measure,      and begin your inspection in the basement or crawlspace.      Determine and record the location of interior foundation      walls, or the equivalent girders and supporting piers or      posts. It's likely that the pattern for the basement is      duplicated in the stories above. To be sure, measure the      position of the first-floor walls, and compare that of the      second-floor walls as well.    </p>    <p>      If you simply have attic storage above the first floor,      look for a central girder (doubled two-bys with joists      extending from both sides at a perpendicular) and establish      whether it's supported only at its ends or from beneath its      midpoint too. Generally, a beam longer than a dozen feet or      so needs some help from below. Should your attic space be a      trussed system (easily identified by a V or W pattern of      boards connecting the joists and roof rafters), it's most      likely supported by two outside walls and doesn't bear on      any interior partitions.    </p>    <p>      Walls vertically in line with each other and a foundation      member can be assumed to support weight, but even walls      parallel to and within 5' or 6' of them may share that      load. Another clue to the presence of a bearing wall is      that the joists above it are too small or spaced too far      apart to span any distance without support. Nonbearing      walls, on the other hand, often run parallel to joists, and      though they may not meet code-sometimes have studs      spaced at distances greater than 16" on center.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>WALLS<br />      When in doubt, consult an engineer</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Ultimately, any appraisal on your part should consider the      requirements of your local residential building code, both      as a clue to how the structure may have been put together      and as a guide to how it should be modified. The code      handbook (available through your county building inspector)      outlines approved techniques and specifies span and load      limits, among other things. If unanswered questions      persist, or if you're not quite ready to remove wall      sheathing to get a better look at what you're up against,      consult a structural engineer. His or her opinion will be      well worth the small investment, particularly if you're      considering a span greater than 12' or if multiple stories      are involved.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Unshrouding the Mystery<br /></strong><br />      You've studied your particular situation thoroughly, and      you're certain that the section of wall you want to remove      is carrying the weight of the floor above. To take care of      that load, you'll need to replace the wall with a header,      or lintel, that itself is held up at its ends on posts.      It's nothing more than a sturdy beam-usually deeper      than it is thick-which allows a clear span across an      opening.    </p>    <p>      Headers can be complicated trusses or expensive steel      I-beams, but for most purposes, two appropriately sized      pieces of dimension lumber fastened around a core layer of      1/2" plywood will be perfectly adequate.    </p>    <p>      An engineer would rely upon a formidable round of      calculations to determine the proper size of a header, but      to save you that trouble we've worked up a reference chart      which simplifies matters immensely. It takes into account      the allowable loads for the three most common sizes of      lumber headers and states their length limits, based upon      whether the house has one or two stories, or two stories      with full attic storage or a third floor.    </p>    <p>      Clearly, you're not going to know exactly how long to make      the header until you've stripped away the wall's finish      surface and can see the internal framing. In preparation      for this, you'll need some standard carpentry tools      (including a framing hammer, a tape measure, butt and cold      chisels, a utility knife, a flat pry bar, a level, pliers      with side cutters, a dry-wall saw and a drill with      extension bits) and a few heavier implements such as a      circular saw, a wrecking bar and a hand sledge. You'll also      want an inexpensive circuit tester, safety glasses, a dust      mask, at least a few 4" clamps and (you can rent this) a      reciprocating saw with wood- and metal-cutting blades.    </p>    <p>      You can try to keep the mess to a minimum, but that will      probably be an exercise doomed to failure. Just use a drop      cloth if you have one, and keep the sharp edges of tools      off the floor . . . you'll appreciate your foresight when      the job's done. Begin at the breaker box by shutting off      power to all the receptacles in the wall you're working on,      then double-checking them with the circuit tester. Chances      are you won't be removing a wall with plumbing in it, but      turn the water supply off and plan to work slowly on your      first saw cut just in case. Using the flat bar, carefully      remove and save the ceiling and baseboard trim and any      other molding around doors, etc.    </p>    			<p>Next, mark off in pencil      the rough area you plan to do away with. Because wall studs      are usually placed 16" apart, it's best to measure inward      from the corners in multiples of that distance so you'll      know where to terminate the opening. Nailhead dimples or      cracked plaster seams are even better indicators of stud      location if you can spot them. On the other hand, it may be      easier to simply remove all the wall sheathing and replace      it as needed later. The material costs involved won't be      that much greater, and this method gives you the advantage      of not having to struggle to spare something that may get      damaged anyway.    </p>     <p>      Start at a point near the top of the wall and drill an      exploratory hole into the wall cavi ty, then use your saw      to cut halfway down through the sheathing. Repeat this      process 9" or so to the inside of your first cut, then      slice horizontally through the top and bottom points so you      can remove a rectangular wall section. Don't try to cut      through both sides of the wall at once; all you're after is      an access from which you can get a clear view to the      soleplate inside the wall. In older buildings, you may      encounter fire stops-wooden blocking nailed more or      less horizontally between studs. If that's the case, cut      into the wall again just below the blocks, but don't go all      the way to the floor . . . just remove enough material to      get a peek at what's inside.    </p>    <p>      Your caution is to prevent you from cutting through the      unknown wire. But once you can see to unsheathe a stud      cavity safely from ceiling to floor, you'll be aware of any      horizontal wiring and will only have to be careful of cable      coming up through the soleplate, which most likely will      terminate at a nearby receptacle. At this point, you can      use your utility knife to slice through any seam or fill      that might inhibit a clean separation at the joint between      the wall and ceiling. Continue removing the wallboard with      care until you've reached your marked limits, then strip      the wall from the opposite side. (The job will be easier if      you drill through the back of the sheathing at the corners      so you can pencil an accurate cut line.) With the framing      exposed, you're ready to prepare the header.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Visible Means of Support</strong><br />      Since the wall studs are already in place, it's simplest to      choose two of them to define where the header will      terminate. Each lintel end must bear upon at least 3 1/2"      of support surface, so it's quite convenient to double up      some of the 2 X 4s you're removing and fasten them to the      flanking studs to serve as posts. One caution: With some      types of construction, the posts may not rest directly over      a joist, so you'll have to plan on shifting them slightly      to one side so they will. If that's impractical, you'll      have to block the space between the floor joists from      below, thus using the girder beneath the joists for      support.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>WALLS<br />      Put space where you want it.</em></strong><br />      Once you know how long to make the header, purchase the      straightest No. 1 grade structural lumber you can find, as      well as a sheet of 1/2" B- or C-grade exterior plywood. Cut      the plywood core to match the depth of your two-bys,      locating the butt joint nearer one end if the lintel is      over 8' in length. Apply a crosshatch pattern of      construction adhesive to all mating surfaces, then clamp      the boards around the plywood. Finish the job by nailing      the assembly together from both sides with 16d common      nails.    </p>    <p>      At this point, you'll need to determine how best to shore      up the ceiling while you work on cutting out the wall      studs. For the sake of convenience, it's easiest to shore      just one side of the wall, and for single- or two-story      homes, that will probably suffice. However, if there are      two floors above the one you're working on, or if the      joists of the floor above the wall aren't nailed together      where they overlap (or if they're not fastened to the      wall's top plate at all), you'll have to shore the ceiling      about 2' from both sides of the wall-and remember      that you'll need room to get the header in place somehow.    </p>    <p>      The shoring framework can be made from 4 X 4 posts with 2 X      6 or greater plates across the top and bottom. Though the      strength of the shoring depends on the weight above, a post      every 4' or 5' should be more than sufficient, and you can      always bolster the frame with internal 2 X 4 studs or a      diagonal brace nailed between the corners. Ideally, you      should be able to use your shoring frame as a "kicker,"      building it slightly taller than the ceiling is high so it      can be driven into place from the floor, raising the joists      above just enough to set the header correctly.    </p>    <p>      A strip of carpet placed underneath the lower shoring plate      will ease this procedure. Should you have to use small      hydraulic or screw jacks to place the shoring, set them on      2'-long 4 X 4 pads positioned over adjoining floor joists,      then use 4 X 4s with short top plates as jacking posts.      Make certain they're perfectly plumb before you apply any      pressure, and don't raise the ceiling more than 3/4" over      level unless you bolster the floor from below. Temporary      supports have a way of walking sideways under pressure, so      check their position often.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Last Stand</strong><br />      There are a number of ways to install a header, and each      has its own merit. The dictates of your building code may      set the precedent, but if there's no specific guidance,      plan on placing longer lintels-say over 5' or      so-directly against the wall's top plate, and shorter      ones the established distance below the plate (see      illustration), filling the gap with short 2 X 4 cripple      studs. If you need to make up only an inch or so, trim out      the header at the bottom with scrap wood.    </p>        <p>      Begin by cutting the existing studs at the center, then      prying each end free. If you want to reuse the studs, cut      them as close to the bottom as you can without hitting the      toenails. Merely sledging the boards of the plate will      splinter their ends and make them unusable.    </p>    <p>      Once the uprights are out, use a circular saw set at a 1      1/2" depth to cut through the soleplate exactly 3" in from      each standing flank stud. Pry the soleplate off the floor      with a wrecking bar, then cut or remove any exposed nails      from the top plate. After double checking the correct      length of the stud support posts, fasten the outside set to      the flank studs with 16d nails, and the inside set to those      you just installed, making sure the posts are plumb all      around and the lower ends are toenailed into the sole      plate.    </p>    <p>      Before placing the header, remeasure the total span      distance and trim the beam's length so there's a fraction      of an inch of free play at one end for fitting. If there's      any notching or edge-shaving to be done, now's the time to      do it. Then, with the help of a couple of friends, lift the      header to the posts, position it, and nail it to both the      flank studs and the supports below. If you're using cripple      studs, cut them to length (don't forget that your ceiling      is probably a bit higher than it should be), and nail them      between the top plate and the header at 16" on center.      Otherwise, nail the header to the plate to keep it from      migrating. Should you need to reroute a wire, it can pass      through 5/8" holes in the cripples or run below the floor      joists in the basement. Don't try to squeeze it between the      planks of the lintel, or it may get damaged.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Buttoning Up</strong><br />      With everything securely in place, you can gradually remove      the shoring and allow the house to settle comfortably on      its new framing. Because it's wise to give the members a      few days to stabilize to their environment, you can use the      time to patch the floor where the soleplate was. Since the      plate was probably set on the subflooring, you may only      have to match the existing underlayment beneath carpeting      or vinyl and piece in the appropriate surface patches. Wood      flooring repair is more complicated, but it also is a      matter of mating pieces to the original flooring and      achieving the same finish height.    </p>    <p>      Covering the header framing is actually somewhat simpler.      Because the lintel is the same thickness as the original      wall frame, it shouldn't be difficult to cut sections of      standard wallboard to fit against the undamaged sheathing.      Trim the edges of the old board if you hadn't already, then      fasten the newly trimmed patches in place around the posts      and header with dry-wall nails. Tape and fill the seams,      patch the nail dimples, and paint or cover the surface to      match the other walls.    </p>    <p>      It's probably naive to assume that every wall remodeling      job will proceed as smoothly as the one described here. But      if you keep in mind that more than half the work is in      planning what to do, doing it right should follow      naturally.    </p>
