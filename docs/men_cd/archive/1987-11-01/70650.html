            <p><strong>MOTHER'S HANDBOOK</strong></p>        <p>      <em>Let's cut the mystery away from this vital skill.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      <em>By Pat Stone</em>    </h5>        <p>      Coaxing an edge onto a trusted tool can be a peace-bringing      and fulfilling process.    </p>    <p>      I've been a tool sharpener for so long my pocketknife blade      can trim a tick's toenails. My kitchen knives can slice a      potato too thin to taste. And long ago I stopped performing      the so-called expert's trick of shaving my beard with an      ax. No sir, I use that tool's edge to floss between my      teeth!    </p>    <p>      None of the above boasts are a bit true. Actually, I've      always found tool sharpening to be very intimidating,      partly because everybody else seemed to be an expert at it.      Still, I knew it was an important skill to master. You      simply can't do many jobs with dull tools, and you can      perform any cutting task much better and more easily with a      sharp one.    </p>    <p>      I finally decided it was time for me to get a handle on the      subject. So I visited local tool sharpeners Roger Korning      (who uses sophisticated Foley Belsaw machinery) and Collier      Davis (a file-and-grindstone man). I got a two hour      personal honing lesson from professional knifemaker Robert      Parrish, who's famed among the gun and-blade set for his      exquisite RP survival knives. I collected tips from Hollen      Orr, a retired craftsman who's built a grandfather's clock      and a set of violins by hand. I spent hours in the shop      with MOTHER'S own workshop wizard, Dennis Burkholder. I      even called up public TV's renowned woodwright, Roy      Underhill, for advice!    </p>    <p>      The result? I'm not ready to trim my face fuzz with an ax,      but I can now put a decent working edge on most of the      tools my family uses. And here's betting I can tell other      novice edge-keeners how to do so, as well.    </p>    <p>      <em>"Do the job right,</em> <em>and you'll get a good edge      in five minutes."</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The pros know a</em> <em>dull tool is more dangerous      than a sharp one.</em>    </p>                                                                                <p>      <strong>Rough Work With a File<br /></strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Let's divvy up the doings right off into two      groups-rough outdoor tools you can sharpen well      enough with a file, and finer blades that need more      specialized care. We'll start with the file jobs because      they take less skill (if more muscle), yet illustrate many      of the principles of fine-tool sharpening. In fact, let's      get right to work by discussing tools many people have      never even <em>thought</em> about sharpening-      <strong>spades</strong> and <strong>shovels</strong> .    </p>    <p>      You won't believe it until you try it, but a sharp spade      (the flat-faced digging tool) or shovel (the curve-faced      one) <em>will</em> cut through dirt far easier than will a      dull one. All you need for the job is a coarse hand file.      (Hollen Orr says, "Use a file on everything it'll cut. With      a file you can see where you've been.") It can be either      single-cut (one set of lines-actually, rows of teeth)      or double-cut (two intersecting sets of teeth). The      double-cut will take more metal off with less effort; the      single-cut will do a finer job.    </p>    <p>      But before you get to filing, let's look at your digging      tool a second. Is it rusted? Not good. As MOTHER'S Dennis      Burkholder puts it, "The only thing that'll ruin the edge      on a tool faster than using it is <em>abusing</em> it. And      nothing'll pit up an edge faster than rust." So scrape off      as much rust as you can with steel wool, and from now on      clean off this (and every) tool after you use it, and rub      it lightly with oil to keep new rust from forming. This      simple step will greatly extend the edges and lives of your      tools.    </p>    <p>      Now for the real work. First, run your file around the top      of the edge some, if need be, to smooth out any nicks in      the blade (Fig. 1). Then consider: A shovel or spade is a      single-beveled tool. It has only one sharp edge, which      leads us to: <em>Sharpening Axiom No. 1: Sharpen      single-beveled tools ONLY on the beveled side</em>      <em>(Fig. 2).</em> You can ruin the cutting edge of the      tool otherwise. In real life, you could probably rescue a      rough tool like a shovel from the mistreatment of having      both sides filed.    </p>    <p>      But do that to your scissors or prized pruners, and they'll      be headed for the junk pile. So brace your spade or shovel      well-this and, almost every sharpening job will go      easier if you clamp your work with C-clamps or in a      vise-and file it on the top, the beveled side. (Keep      your forgers out of the way.) You can run your file up into      the blade or down the blade, whichever's easier. Use a file      that matches the contour of the blade: a flat one for that      flat-faced spade and a half-round one for the curved      shovel.    </p>    <p>      What kind of angle should you sharpen at? Ah, that takes us      right to: <em>Sharpening Axiom No. 2: In general, sharpen      the bevel at the same angle that was already there.</em> In      other words, if you can tell what angle the manufacturer or      prior sharpener used, follow it.    </p>    <p>      If you can't tell, move on to: <em>Sharpening Axiom No. 3:      Sharpening at a steep angle gives a more durable edge;      sharpening at a low angle gives a sharper edge</em> (Fig.      3). The thin edge produced by low angle sharpening will      obviously be sharper than a wider edge, but it will be more      brittle as well. Since we're honing a digging tool that's      likely to strike roots or rocks, a tough edge is probably      more important than a super sharp one, so sharpen your      spade at a fairly-high angle say, one that puts a      shine back only about 1/4 inch into the blade. Press the      file hard on your forward stroke, going the full length of      the sharpening tool (so you won't wear the file out in one      spot). Your backstroke should be light, little more than      the weight of the tool, to keep from breaking any file      teeth.    </p>    <p>      And angle the file across the blade face as you push rather      than going straight into the blade (Fig. 4). That'll help      you sharpen the edge evenly. It may also help you run the      file teeth at a more effective right angle to your work.      (Does that sound cuckoo? Look at the lines of file teeth.      If they run at an angle, working the file across can help      run those teeth right into the work.) Sharpener Collier      Davis dips his file in water frequently as he works, to      wash off the shavings, and says that this lengthens the      life and increases the bite of the tool. Eventually,      though, any file will wear out. When yours doesn't work      well anymore, and unclogging it with a wire brush won't fix      it, replace it. Once you've run the file across the entire      blade a while, you'll have created a shiny tapered edge. If      you run a finger on the underside of the blade, from the      inside out to the tip, you may be able to feel a slight      <em>burr</em> (also called a <em>wire or feather</em> ) at      the edge. That's the best sign that things are getting      sharp.    </p>    <p>      The burr is created when the edge gets so thin it won't      stand the pressure of the file, so it bends over to the      other side (Fig. 5). It's so small you can't see it. And it      may be hard to feel, almost like running your hand over a      piece of transparent tape. (If you have trouble, try      drawing your fingernail at a 45Â° angle toward the      burr.) Keep filing until you can feel that burr-all      the way along the edge. It's critical to good sharpening.      Besides, getting a sense of this large, relatively      easy-to-sense burr will help you know what to feel for on      the finer tools we'll cover later. Now all that's left is      to remove this fragile feather. To do so, lightly run your      file flush with the unbeveled surface of the spade. I know,      I told you not to sharpen that side.    </p>    <p>      You're not, because you're not filing into the blade at an      angle, just filing <em>along</em> it. You might then want      to turn the shovel over and lightly file into your first      side again to remove any burr that got pushed back over to      it, and you'll be ready to dig like the dickens. OK, that      job was easy enough. Let's move on to another commonly used      but rarely sharpened tool-the <strong>garden      hoe</strong> Again, you simply won't believe how much      better that weed chopper will work once it's got a good      edge on it. And why make weeding any more work than it is      already? Use the same techniques described above: Your hoe      (plain or fancy) has a single-bevel cutting edge, so you're      going to sharpen only that one side. If you can't tell by      looking, the cutting edge is at the bottom of the tool,      running right along the ground when you're using the hoe.      (A hoe's flat upper edge pushes dirt out of the way while      its bottom face cuts roots.) Sharpen the beveled side well      with your file. At what angle do you sharpen? Follow the      existing angle or try Dennis Burkholder's old-timey trick:      Scrape the tool along some cement, standing just like you      were using it to weed (Fig. 6). Then sharpen where you see      scratch marks. That way you'll be setting the cutting edge      at the perfect angle to suit your height and posture.    </p>    <p>      File until you've drawn out a burr. Then trim that wire off      the other side, and give the first side a couple of extra      light licks. And from now on, whenever your garden weeds      start to feel a bit stubborn (which may happen a couple of      times a day), take a short break and give your hoe a quick      keening. You'll save time and energy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Your lawn mower blade,</strong> more of the same.      Disconnect the spark plug (just in case the cantankerous      thing gets any ideas), then unbolt the blade and clamp it      in a vise. Tip: If you set it (and other tools) so you can      look "into" the end of the blade, you can better see if      you're maintaining the proper angle. File the cutting side      only, creating a shiny bevel about 1/8 inch or so wide      (Fig. 7). You may want to use a half-round file in the      bowed portion of the blade. Sharpen both ends of the blade      to match, using the single-bevel techniques already      described. All done? Whoa, don't put the blade back on yet.    </p>    <p>      First make sure it's balanced end to end. Set the center of      the clean (no grass on it) blade on the corner of your file      and see if both sides weigh the same (Fig. 8). (The center      should be at the middle of the main hole. You can measure      in from both ends to make sure.) If one side sinks, file a      little bit off the back edge of that heavy side, and      balance it again. Don't neglect this step: Dennis      Burkholder (who once helped design mowers) says it's just      as important as sharpening the blade. Otherwise, your blade      may wobble when it spins, and that 3,600 rpm shimmy will      eventually wear out the oil seals on the blade's shaft.      You'll find yourself with a strange-and expensive-problem      to fix: "Whenever the motor of my mower warms up, oil runs      out the bottom.    </p>    <p>      " Once the blade is nicely sharp and balanced, put it back      on the mower-cutting edge up. (That position, coupled with      the airplane like lift created by the up-curve in back of      the blade, helps keep cut grass up off the ground so it can      be blown out. By the way, if you put the blade on upside      down, you'll be surprised by how poorly it cuts-I sure      was!)    </p>    <p>      <em>Pruning shears? Grass clippers? Tin snips?</em> You can      file them into shape, no problem. Remember, they're      single-beveled tools.    </p>    <p>      So if you mess with the insides of those closing blades      (except to lightly remove burrs), don't blame me for what      happens. Actually, if your pruning shears aren't cutting      well, it may be that there's too much play between the      blades. Tighten the nut in the middle and see if that      helps. Heck, you can even sharpen one of those jagged-edge      hand    </p>    <p>      <strong>swing blades</strong> (also called grass whips)      with a file. Run it down the bottom cutting side and it'll      get both the peaks and valleys of the blade (Fig. 9). OK,      it's time to move on to a more labor-demanding subject: the    </p>    <p>      <strong>ax</strong> . To sharpen most dull axes, you're      going to have to file back a shine on each side 3/8- to      1/2-inch long, and that means removing a lot of material.      Woodwright Roy Underhill uses a single- or double cut file      for this job, drawing the file back and forth along the      side of the blade with both hands (Fig. 10). He says this      technique makes it easier to keep an accurate angle while      you work, keeps you from accidentally pushing your hand      into the blade and leaves a smoother finish. Some other      sharpeners I met feel that a dull ax requires so much      filing that this is one time a power grinding wheel is a      big help. If you do use a wheel, for Pete's sake, be      careful. It takes off material awfully quickly, and as      Collier Davis notes, "You can't put it back on.    </p>    <p>      " Then, too, if you let any part of your tool get too hot      from rubbing against the wheel, its temper will be ruined      forever. (Whenever the tool starts to get hot, dunk it in a      bucket of water.) So go slow-the slower the wheel,      the better. In fact, a hand-cranked sandstone wheel like      Roy Underhill uses would be ideal. And follow these safety      rules: Wear protective goggles with a power wheel. Hold the      ax so it can't possibly jam or get snapped back at you. And      keep your hands away from that wheel.    </p>    <p>      First off, file around the edge or carefully hold the ax      edge itself straight into the wheel, perpendicular, and run      that edge tip to tip to wear out any nicks. Then grind or      file all along one side (Fig. 11), holding the ax so that      3/a inch or a hair more of the side is getting worn. (Tip:      If your wheel has a front guard plate, you can tilt it to      the correct angle and rest your ax on that improvised      guide.) You don't want to grind too far back, or you'll      make the tip too thin. An ax blade needs to be a bit      thick-more so than a hoe or spade, for      instance-so that it won't get stuck in the wood      you're chopping. Raise a burr all along the edge, flip the      ax over, and grind or file away until you raise a burr on      the other side. That's it for the rough work. To really      finish the job, you'll need a good honing      stone-Carborundum, Arkansas, Washite, whatever (I'll      talk more about them soon). You can hold the ax and rub it      with the stone like the old-time woodsmen do, but that's a      tough trick, because you're trying to keep a precise angle      while working freehand with both objects. It's much easier      to vise or clamp either the stone or ax in place. Then draw      one object across the other so that the stone cuts into the      blade. The key here is to keep the entire edge at the same      angle, and on both sides. It's not easy. Fortunately, an ax      is a hard, rough-work tool, so as long as you're going to      chop wood instead of whiskers, you can get away with some      beginner's wobbling.    </p>    <p>      It'll be good practice for knife sharpening and, more      important, you'll be smoothing out those ground sides and      closing up pores where rust could work in. (For the same      reason, using a stone to finish any of the tools we've      sharpened so far is probably a good idea.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Art of Sharpening a Knife</strong>    </p>    <p>      OK, let's put the file and outdoor tools away and come      inside to learn some refined sharpening skills-most      especially, putting a good edge on a knife. I'm afraid that      job won't be as easy to describe as the others; as      professional knifemaker Robert Parrish puts it, "There's      lots of controversy over knife sharpening, lots of ways to      do it." Roy Underhill concurs, noting that "many people are      into the sharper-than-thou thing, saying everything    </p>    <p>      has to be done the right way-theirs." (Parrish      doesn't think much of disputes over techniques: "Basically,      they all work.")    </p>    <p>      For an example of these hones of contention, consider:      Should you oil or water a sharpening stone? Underhill feels      it helps the stones stay soft and keeps them from getting      "glazed"-gummed up with metal shavings.    </p>    <p>      (He even quotes the Trevisa, a thirteenth-century medieval      encyclopedia that recommends ". . . diverse maner of      whetsones, and some neden water and some neden oyl for to      whette.") Parrish doesn't lubricate his stones, though.      Neither does John Juranitch. John What? Who's he? He's the      guy who wrote the best book we know on this topic, <em>The      Razor Edge Book of Sharpening</em> . He holds the world      record for rapidly sharpening a dull ax and shaving his      beard with it. He's made a business of helping thousands of      butchers and packing houses improve their cutting edges.    </p>    <p>      And he's studied dry- and wet-honed edges under      10,000-power electron microscopes. He says oiling a stone      just creates an abrasive grinding compound on top of the      stone that can actually dull a blade. Me? I figure if an      expert like that doesn't go for oiling, that's a good      enough excuse for a beginner like me to take the easy way      out and not do it either.    </p>    <p>      Another big dispute I've run into is double-edging.      Juranitch says to put a low <em>secondary</em> , or relief,      angle on the sides of the blade with a coarse hone and then      put a steeper <em>primary</em> edge on just the tip of the      blade (Fig.12). However, none of the people I talked with      consistently do this. (Underhill: "Someone who looked in my      tool chest would find tools sharpened all sorts of ways; I      do what it takes to make a tool work.") Since this is a      beginner's article, I'll just go into the more common      single-edge sharpening here.    </p>    <p>      If you want to move onto double-edging after you master      basic sharpening, read Juranitch's book. Feud number three:      What kind of sharpening stone should you use? Parrish likes      Carborundum; my editor swears by his Japanese water stones;      Underhill likes Washita or even Belgium white clay pieces      he finds at the junk dealers. Best as I can figure, it      doesn't much matter. What is important is that you have two      abrasive surfaces: a coarse one to get the hard grinding      done faster and a fine one for the finish sharpening. A      coarse stone wears material away quickly until the blade      angle is what you want it to be, but if you continue to use      it past that point, it'll take off your sharp edge rather      than finish it. The fine one gives you that final keen,      smooth edge.    </p>    <p>      If you want to use natural stones for these jobs, remember      that a soft stone is more abrasive than a hard one. (The      fine, glasslike surface on a hard stone is for finishing.)      Seems to me, the easiest thing to do is drop by your local      hardware store and get a two-sided (one rough, one smooth)      Carborundum stone. They work swell. What ever stone you      use, do get a big one, at least six inches long, so you'll      have enough room to do a full sharpening stroke. (A      seven-inch Carborundum runs around $12 in our area.) A      couple more things and we'll be ready to begin. One, fasten      your stone in a vise or clamp, secure it within a small      wooden frame-do something so it won't move around.    </p>    <p>      You'll have enough trouble getting a consistent sharpening      angle with only the blade moving. Don't make things worse      by letting the stone wiggle around as well. Two, for your      first practice sessions, get hold of an inexpensive      high-carbon knife. They wear away a lot more easily than      your stainless steel Swiss Army or kitchen butchering      knife, so you can see results (good and bad) a whole lot      faster. (Besides, with one of those you won't mess up a      really good knife while you're learning.) I practiced on a      flea market set of kitchen knives. Enough preamble.    </p>    <p>      Fasten your rough stone in place. Hold your knife with two      hands, one hand on the handle and the other supporting the      blade (thumb on the blunt back edge). Hold the blade at a      slight-not steep-angle (the magic number is      20Â°, but who's measuring?), and push the blade along      the stone as if you were trying to cut a slice out of its      surface (Fig. 13). Sound easy? It's not.    </p>    <p>      You want to sharpen the whole edge of the blade with every      stroke, so you've got to move the blade diagonally as you      push it forward so its tip will make contact with the stone      before you reach the end of the stroke (Fig.      14)-that's why you want a good-sized honing stone.      You'll also have to lift up on the handle of the blade a      bit as you get to the tip, or that curved edge won't really      meet the stone (Fig. 15). And-most important of      all-you've got to keep the same angle on the blade      with each and every stroke. That's the real problem.    </p>    <p>      Listen to Robert Parrish: "It'll take an hour for the      average person to sharpen a pocketknife-and it still      won't be really sharp. Do the job right and you'll get a      good edge in five minutes. Ninety-nine percent of the      problem is in the angle." If you keep changing the angle as      you work (ever so slightly, ever so unintentionally),      you'll keep hitting edge to stone at different points and,      in effect, rounding off the edge of the blade, making it      dull instead of sharp. It sure happened to me.    </p>    <p>      Parrish gave me a good one-on-one lesson, went off to help      a customer, came back and found I'd made my pocketknife      duller instead of sharper. I figured R.P. had more      important things to do than watch me mess up, so I went      home to do what he (and all the other experts I talked to)      emphasized: Practice. (It helped.) Some other tips: Hold      that thumb backstop on the blade so the side of it touches      the stone while the middle of it holds the blade at the      angle you want. Sharpen by pivoting your body at the waist      so you'll have your wrists and elbows locked. And you can,      if you'd rather, do your rough honing by moving sections of      the blade round and round in a circular motion. Underhill      figures that makes it easier to keep the correct angle      because you're not repeatedly lifting the blade off the      stone.    </p>    <p>      If you're getting frustrated or just want to make the whole      job go a lot easier, get a sharpening guide-a little      blade clamp that automatically holds your knife at the      right angle (Fig. 16). Buck Knives makes one, called the      Honemaster, and Juranitch offers the Razor Edge Knife      Sharpening Guide. Let me tell you, unlike many sharpening      gimmicks, these two doodads work. You may just want to use      them as training wheels, but beard-axer Juranitch claims no      expert can "freehand" a knife edge as well as an amateur      with a guide can.    </p>    <p>      He's even proved it repeatedly by having pairs of      novices-his daughters, Boy Scouts, professional      outdoor writers-use his guide to sharpen pocketknives      and then by shaving his own face with those blades. OK,      guided or not, work that one side of the blade until you      can raise a burr along the whole edge. Keep working until      you get that burr-let it be your teacher. Once you've      got a full-length burr, turn the knife over and sharpen the      other side by pulling the blade toward you. Your blade hand      position will have to change here.    </p>    <p>      This time put your fingers behind the blade and let your      thumb press down on the side (Fig. 17). Everything else is      the same. Keep a constant blade angle (the same one you had      on the other side), stroke the whole blade on the stone,      and lift the handle some as you get to the tip so it will      get sharpened too (Fig. 18). Work that side until you raise      a full burr going the other way. Now switch to your fine      stone for the finish work. Stroke once away from you (as      you did at first) and once toward you. Alternate about a      dozen strokes, forward and backward, on the stone. Don't      press as hard on these strokes as you did on the rough-side      ones. And you can keep lightening up so your last few      strokes carry just the weight of the knife.    </p>    <p>      You're done-or are you? How can you tell if your      knife is sharp? Well, you can run your thumb over (not      down-ow!) the edge and feel if it tends to catch in      your thumbprint grooves. You can hold a piece of paper by      the corner and see if your knife will- cut (not tear) into      it. And you can try to shave hair off the back of your arm      with it. If it does all that, congratulations! You've done      well. If not, repeat your steps on the fine stone. That'll      probably do the trick. If it doesn't, you're most likely      not holding the knife at a constant sharpening angle. Keep      practicing-or get a sharpening guide. Once you've got      a fine edge, you might want to put an extra finishing touch      on it by stroking it down a steel or a pair of ceramic      sticks. Most of these are set at an angle. All you have to      do is hold your blade vertical and run it straight down the      stick, drawing the full blade against it as you do.    </p>    <p>      Regular use of these last aids will help keep a good edge      on a blade, but they will not fix a dull one. Put that kind      back on the stone. Now you can sharpen all the knives in      your home. Most of them will take that same slight angle      you put on your first blade. If you're honing a butchering      knife that's going to be going through bone, put a steep      angle on it so the edge won't be likely to break. If you're      keening a delicate-work fillet knife, give it a very slim      taper.    </p>    <p>      Let's move on and sharpen a wood <strong>chisel</strong> or      a <strong>plane</strong> . Another two-stage job, rough      then fine. You can do the rough work with a coarse stone, a      file or a grinding wheel (if you're real careful).      Remember, the most important thing: This is a single-bevel      blade so sharpen it only on the angled side or all is lost.      Follow the original bevel unless you're going to be cutting      into very hard wood-in which case, you'd want a      steeper (tougher) angle. Hollen Orr clamps his chisel in a      vise, so that the edge is horizontal, then runs his file      down the face of it until he raises a burr (Fig. 19). Note:      He uses a fine file for this operation, following the rule      that the harder the object, the finer the file. (A fine      file's tiny teeth can better reach into the fine pores of a      hard object.) He smooths the burr off by rubbing the back      side with a fine stone set flat (not at an angle), then      touches up the cutting side a bit with the fine stone. When      he's done, that chisel will pop the hairs off his arm. If      you're not so confident about your own freehand sharpening,      you could use Juranitch's knife sharpening guide (but not      the Honemaster) on it and be sure you'll maintain a set      angle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Enjoying the Grind</strong> In short, simply      combine the techniques given here with some serious      dedication to practice (you'll know you're practicing      enough if people start asking you why there's no hair on      your left forearm). Soon you'll be able to sharpen plenty      of the tools around your place. And you'll probably do so      more often than you'd think, because it gets to be an      enjoyable task. I gain a curious sense of peacefulness from      putting an edge on a favorite blade or tool.    </p>    <p>      The slow rhythm of metal stroking on stone is a calming      sound, a serviceable sort of music our forefathers knew      well. It's one that's well worth your, and my,      rediscovering.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Access</strong> <em>The Razor Edge Book of      Sharpening</em> and Razor Edge Knife Sharpening Guide are      available for $12.50 and $9.95, respectively, from Razor      Edge Systems, Inc., Box 150, Ely, MN 55731.
