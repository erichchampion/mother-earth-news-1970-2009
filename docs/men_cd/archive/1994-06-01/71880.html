            	<p>					<strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>     </p>        <p>      <em><strong>Peter Godley of Eddington, Maine, sticks it to      those warm-weather pests.</strong></em>    </p>        <h3>      Getting Away Scot-Free			</h3>		<p>			Where I frequently have to cross a barbed wire or    electric fence, I slit a piece of garden hose and slip it    over that part of the wire. It saves my pants and my temper    without reducing the effectiveness of the fence.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Phyllis Hubbard<br />      Corydon, IN</em>    </p>    <h3>      Don't Waste a Drop    </h3>    <p>      We recently installed a new high-efficiency gas furnace.      Besides the obvious savings, we've found another one. In      cold weather, such as we've had this winter, when the      furnace runs a lot, the condensation created amounts to      about four gallons of water a day. Rather than draining it      into the cesspool, we started collecting it and using it in      the washing machine and steam iron. Water from the      dehumidifier, in the summer, can be used the same day. Nice      soft water, free of charge!    </p>    <p>      <em>- Walter Brooks<br />      Bemidji, MN</em>    </p>    <h3>      What Does Your Detector Do?    </h3>    <p>      Regarding John Vivian's article, "Fireproof Your Home"      (issue #142), some smoke detectors detect only smoke,      others detect only a rapid rise in temperature. It is good      to know exactly what yours does. Check it by opening the      cover and let smoke from an incense stick drift into the      sensing unit. Check for heat sensing by holding an electric      hair dryer near the sensor. The alarm should sound if it is      heat sensitive and operating properly. Blowing a dryer      could cause the unit to function improperly; check the      manufacturer's recommended maintenance procedures to ensure      you do no damage.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Fred Wark<br />      Lakeland, MI</em>    </p>        <h3>      Ain't No Flies on Me    </h3>    <p>      About 30 years ago a man wrote to the <em>Bangor Daily      News</em> saying, "If everyone did this the state of Maine      wouldn't have a black-fly problem." His suggestion was to      wear a hard hat smeared with oil.    </p>    <p>      Unappealing? Absolutely, but it works. And for the past 30      years it has been a blessing to me. It is the only hat that      keeps my bald head from sweating. The hats are adjustable      to size and do not fall off when bending down. They are      cool and comfortable when adjusted. In the fall there is a      new hatching of black flies for a few days but because I      wear the hat every day there are thousands which won't be      breeding next year.    </p>    <p>      About 15 years ago I drove into Bangor to get something my      wife needed at the supermarket and forgot I was wearing my      hat with flies. I was stopped several times by shoppers      asking, "Are they flies?" "Yes, they are black flies." At      that time I was using baby oil but have found that any kind      of oil works. I find the best to be chain saw bar oil      because it contains a sticky substance that inhibits it      from flying off the chain and also protects your shirt from      drips on a hot day. Any color hat will do! That's our son      Joe in the picture.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Peter Godley<br />      Eddington, ME</em>    </p>        <h3>     Squirreled Away		 </h3>    <p>		Here are two pictures showing how I have finally baffled    the squirrels that were emptying my pole-type feeder. It    involves recycling a glass one-gallon wine bottle. Cut the    bottom out of the wine bottle. Cut a piece of black plastic    pipe about three inches shorter than the feeder mounting    pole. Place the plastic pipe over the pole, place the altered    wine bottle over the pole and onto the pipe, mount the feeder    on the pole.</p>    <p>      I had to empty a second wine bottle and alter it. I had one      squirrel that was really an athlete. The second bottle      stymied him. To mount the second bottle, I cut a piece from      the existing plastic pipe the length of the second bottle.      I then placed the long piece of plastic pipe over the pole,      then the first bottle, then the short piece of plastic      pipe, then the second bottle, then the feeder. No squirrel      has been able to compromise this arrangement for the last      five winters. Their antics are hilarious.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Fred L. Babbitt<br />      South Windsor, CT</em>    </p>    <h3>      A Grid Saves the Day    </h3>    <p>      If you get frustrated as I do when trying to cultivate      among spreading vines, make a grid! I determined the 12      feet between hills would give me a space to maneuver my      Allis Chalmer G tractor and cultivator as I try to till      between cukes, pumpkins, and squash. I set metal electric      fence rods along one edge of the garden at 12-foot      intervals. I did the same along each perpendicular edge.    </p>    <p>      With the tractor, I drove from each rod on the east side      straight across the west, leaving wheel tracks as I went. I      did the same from the south to the north. Lo! A grid with      each intersection marking the place to plant the seeds.    </p>    <p>      You can do the same. Figure out the space your cultivator      or tiller will need to get between the vines as they      spread. Mark the distance along one edge of your garden      with flags or posts. Do the same on the perpendicular edge      and then make tracks in two directions with your tiller.      Plant at the intersections of your tracks, and you too,      will enjoy tilling among the vines.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Bonnie Gelle<br />      Grand Rapids, MN</em>    </p>    <h3>      A Brush for Under a Buck    </h3>    <p>      To construct a number of small brushes, go to a thrift      market or yard sale and purchase an old car or windshield      brush. Take it home and saw it into small brushes. You can      shape the bristles with scissors. Now tell me, what can you      buy for a nickel nowadays that gives you such value?    </p>    <p>      <em>- Russell L. Skinner<br />      Central Point, OR</em>    </p>    <h3>      No Pain - No Stain    </h3>    <p>      After reading ("Walnut Tips" #143) in Country Lore, I      realized that what I have been doing for years is not      common knowledge. Why go through the trouble of getting rid      of the stain when you can do without it.    </p>        <p>      After you enjoy collecting the walnuts, just drop them on a      hard surface, one that you don't care about staining. I use      a three foot section of a 4" x 4" as my crusher. Lift it      about a foot or so and let it fall on a walnut. The weight      is enough to crack the hull but not enough to crack the      shell. Usually the hull splits right off. For those ornery      ones that don't, wear a pair of rubber gloves and hull the      rest of the way. You can hull a bushel or so in about an      hour. It's cleaner and it gives you a little aerobic weight      lifting.    </p>    <p>      After the nuts are hulled, with gloves still on, put them      in a bread rack in a single layer to dry for a couple of      days in the sun. Be sure to put them up and out of reach of      squirrels. I learned the hard way the first year. I lost      half of my nuts and now have enough walnut trees growing on      my property to start my own lumber mill in 50 years.    </p>    <p>      After they have dried, put them in mesh potato bags and      hang them in the garage to further dry and cure. Next year      you can crack them and use them. If you crack them the same      year, the meat is usually still moist and will mildew.      After cracking the nuts ( I usually pick them while I'm      watching TV), I save the big pieces for cookies and      brownies, the smaller pieces for cakes and bread, and the      fine stuff for the birds' and squirrels' winter treat.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Jim Polk<br />      Jamestown, OH</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Next issue "Country Lore" will be bigger      still.
