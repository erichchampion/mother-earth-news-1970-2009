            		<p><strong>BOOTSTRAPS</strong></p>        <p>      <em>Home-business expert Marc Esenson offers a dozen bps on      starting a small home enterprise.</em>    </p>        <p>      Once upon a time, hard work, dedication to the company,      and/or a strong union guaranteed your job for life. Today,      it's far more prudent to assume that sooner or later, you      and your job will part company (if you haven't already).    </p>    <p>      When that occurs, will you feel victimized, depressed, and      desperate? Or will you be ready to seize the opportunity      for a great new beginning? Your choice. It is my firm      belief-and long-term experience - that developing and      maintaining a teeny, tiny business of your own, what I call      an Ace in the Hole, is the best investment you can make for      your future.    </p>    <p>      You don't need to burn any bridges, mortgage the farm, quit      your job, hire attorneys and accountants - or even      necessarily invent a better mousetrap. You just need to      pick a reasonable path, take a few well-calculated, very      low-risk steps, and let your Ace grow slowly. Along the      way, you'll get two bonuses: extra income and more tax      deductions.    </p>    <p>      So why isn't there a business booming on every kitchen      table? Despite America's reputation as The Land of      Opportunity, you probably believe that starting a business      is costly, risky, and regulated, and that you'd be nuts to      try. Nonsense! Allow me to demystify the process:    </p>    <h3>      1. Start now.    </h3>    <p>      Begin by simply giving the possibility of creating an Ace      in the Hole some serious consideration. My friend Al Lococo      always dreamed of retiring into his own business and gave      the notion a lot of thought. Eventually, Al came to believe      that he really could be his own boss. So, about 18 months      ago, he decided to retain his job but moonlight in a small      computer business. Al filed his chosen business name at the      county courthouse, opened a business checking account,      registered with the state sales tax people, and converted      one room of his house into a workshop/office. His total      investment was "pocket change," but Al's <em>Ace</em> was      in place, and public.    </p>    <h3>      2. Find a niche.    </h3>    <p>      Your journey to entrepreneurial glory can't begin until you      have a product or service that people will happily pay you      to provide. Do you already know what your Ace will be?      Great. But don't rush to place a full-page ad in the      newspaper just yet. If inspiration hasn't struck, there are      lots of ways to find it. For example, skim through the      yellow pages, scan the classified ads in newspapers, walk      down Main Street - or through a mall. Pay attention      to how others are making a living on their own, and tune in      whenever you hear, "I wish there were someone I could call      to ...." Then, make a list of things you know how to do.      Really! Be serious, be silly, be creative - but fill      up at least a page.    </p>    <p>      Put a star next to a few things on your list that you'd      enjoy doing. Then pick one to try. Although Al could have      easily parlayed his love of old cars, for example, into a      perfectly reasonable business, he wisely decided to build      on his love of computers.    </p>    <p>      While there's a benefit to doing something better, cheaper,      faster, or with a dazzlingly brilliant twist, the only      requirement is that you serve a real need at a fair price.      Reinventing the wheel is not necessary.    </p>		<h3>		 3. Stop to look and listen.		 </h3>    <p>      Talk to everyone you know about your idea - but don't      take everything you hear to heart. You'll get good advice,      helpful insights, and a hefty dose of discouragement.      Still, great ideas lurk in strange places, and disclose      themselves when least expected. Al initially decided to      transfer his computer expertise into a desktop publishing      business, which he named "Viable Visuals." But, because he      was flexible, and open to opportunity, Al soon found a more      appropriate niche. He happened to mention his new business      venture to his doctor. During a physical, the two men were      chatting about computers and the doctor said, "I'd like to      hire someone to make monthly backups of the data on my      computer's hard drive and to check my PC for viruses." By      the time Al's pants were back on, he'd found a great      service he could provide to local doctors ...and other      small businesses, including mine. He also received a clean      bill of health and acquired his first paying customer.    </p>    <h3>      4. Slow and steady still wins most races.		</h3>   <p>		Set your sights on developing a modest "backup" source of    income - not on creating a new corporate empire.    Micro-mini businesses expose you to micro-mini risks. Since    Al enjoyed and could keep his fulltime job, he was in an    ideal position to start small, while he slowly and steadily    nurtured and focused his business. Then, when Al was offered    a generous, early retirement package, after 28 years on the    job, he was ready. Now he's working at his Ace full time and    loving it.</p>    <h3>      5. There's a lot in a name.    </h3>    <p>      Take your time picking out a name and logo. I believe that      Al's "Viable Visuals" moniker might have worked for desktop      publishing, but it doesn't come close to describing the      computer backups, upgrades, trouble shooting, and virus      protection service Al's actually providing. The last      handicap any business needs is a "bad" name.    </p>        <h3>      6. If at first you don't succeed...    </h3>    <p>      The nice thing about a tiny business is the ease with which      you can change direction, purpose, or speed. So don't hold      on to an idea that turns out not to work. Try another.      Eventually, one idea will be right for you. Al thought      desktop publishing would be his ticket to a smooth passage      from the corporate world to his dream of self-employment.      Fortunately, he wasn't afraid to alter his course.    </p>    <p>      If you keep at it, regularly putting in time and energy,      you'll find an Ace that will make you money, give you tax      breaks, and protect you from the vagaries of our economy.    </p>    <h3>      7. Appearance counts.    </h3>    <p>      You, and what you produce, should look great. That doesn't      mean you need a glossy brochure, a Tinsel-Town video, or a      $1,000 outfit. But do avoid chewing gum or blowing smoke in      the face of a potential client, especially one who's trying      to decipher the estimate you've scrawled on the back of a      mud-soaked envelope.    </p>    <h3>      8. Triple-check your work.    </h3>    <p>      Mistakes are costly - and leave everyone wondering      what else you might have done wrong. Can you be trusted in      the future?    </p>    <h3>      9. Always do what you say you'll do, and      more.    </h3>    <p>      Customers appreciate speedy service. When you have a      problem, say, a deadline that can't be met, give your      customers the scoop right away. Say you're sorry with a      discount - or a free gift. In fact, throw in extras      even when you don't screw up.    </p>    <p>      <strong>10. Be accessible, very accessible</strong> -      to both existing customers and potential new ones. And      remember, it's not just customers who count. Win the      respect of suppliers and you'll get faster deliveries, plus      valuable referrals. While no one drops everything to answer      a letter or speak to every caller, do reply promptly.      Remember how you felt when last you paced, waiting to hear      from a doctor, lawyer, or mechanic? Take every caller's      questions seriously. Back in 1989, Al took a call from a      woman with an amazing number of questions about his loan      software. Later, he found out that she was working on an      assignment for a large computer magazine. Al's technical      support helped him secure a great review when he really      needed it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>11. Zero in on the special needs of those accounts      you already have.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sure, keep trying to attract newcomers, but take this old      cliche seriously: 80% of your business should come from 20%      of your customers. Treat every one of your clients like a      VIP.    </p>    <p>      <strong>12. One last thought.</strong>    </p>    <p>      New adventures add to the excitement of life and keep us      from growing stale. Starting your own business can be      wonderfully exhilarating, especially if you believe that      it's not whether you "make it big" that matters, but      whether you make it fun, or meaningful.    </p>    <h3>      Don't Be Stopped by the "You-Can't-Suceeed-in-Business''      Myths    </h3>    <p>      The conventional wisdom starts with the old saw that most      small businesses fail because they're "undercapitalized."      Hogwash. Begin small arid part time, then grow slowly, and      you won't have to put the touch on friends and family      - or plead your case to banks or venture capitalists.      In truth, if you start small enough, the only thing you'll      have to fear is success. You won't have to get bogged down      in plans - be they marketing, business, financing,      operating, decorating, or floor plans. You won't need to      spend a lot of time or money on: advertising, employees,      insurance, stationery, business cards, logos, lawyers,      bookkeeping, contracts, office space, or phone systems, to      name but a few. If and when you need a little help, there      will be someone with an Ace, ready to handle every dreaded      detail.    </p>    <p>      No need to try to keep your eyes from glazing over as you      read boring tomes on accounting for the small business,      market research, or capital formation. For down-to-earth      advice on Ace building, there is one book I heartily      recommend: <em>Homemade Money</em> , by Barbara Brabec      (Better Way Publications, 1992). You also don't need to      worry about finding the perfect location. In this age of      faxes, modems, and toll-free numbers, most businesses can      be started - then successfully operated - right      from your home. Don't worry, <em>wonder</em> !    </p>    <p>      Where will your Ace lead? Will it be all you're dreamed      about - or more? Will you decide to stick it out in      the 9 to 5 rat race, or head out on your own? Time will      tell.    </p>		<p><em>For a sample of Marc Eisenson's newsletter; send $1    plus an SASE to Box 78, Elizaville NY 12523</em> <em>.</em></p>
