EDT (occurs 1, 2, or 3 hours      earlier - thus on May 31- in the farther      Western time zones).    </p>    <p>      <strong>2</strong>    </p>    <p>      Corpus Christi.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3</strong>    </p>    <p>      World Environment Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>6</strong>    </p>    <p>      Venus at its highest in West-Northwest at dusk for several      weeks around this time. The planet will remain visible in      the evening until early autumn. It is the brightest point      of light in the sky.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8</strong>    </p>    <p>      Venus 5° South of the star Pollux.    </p>    <p>      <strong>9</strong>    </p>    <p>      NEW MOON, 4:27 A.M. EDT; Muslim New Year (1415 A.H.) begins      at sunset (if moon is seen at dusk).    </p>    <p>      <strong>11</strong>    </p>    <p>      Venus forms a line with Pollux and Castor tonight (Moon to      lower left); King Kamehameha I Day in Hawaii.    </p>    <p>      <strong>12</strong>    </p>    <p>      Moon-Venus-Pollux-Castor line tonight.    </p>    <p>      <strong>14</strong>    </p>    <p>      Flag Day; earliest sunrise at 40° North latitude      - 5:30 A.M. daylight saving time (4:30 A.M. standard      time).    </p>    <p>      <strong>15</strong>    </p>    <p>      St. Vitus Day (rain today means rain for 30 days in a row).      St. Vitus is supposed to have been put to death during the      reign of Roman Emperor Diocletian; Vitus's help is invoked      in cases of epilepsy and "St Vitus's Dance" (chorea).    </p>    <p>      <strong>16</strong>    </p>    <p>      FIRST QUARTER MOON, 3:56 P.M. EDT.    </p>    <p>      <strong>18</strong>    </p>    <p>      Saturn's rings most near edgeon for 1994 (just 5° from      edge-on). To the naked eye, Saturn now appears as the      brightest point of light rising in the East-Southeast      around midnight or a little later.    </p>    <p>      <strong>19</strong>    </p>    <p>      Father's Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>20</strong>    </p>    <p>      Venus in Northern part of Beehive star cluster this evening      and tomorrow evening. Use binoculars to see the little      collection of stars glittering near and about tremendously      brighter Venus.    </p>    <p>      <strong>21</strong>    </p>        <p>      Summer Solstice, 10:49 A.M. EDT. This is the longest day of      the year - the best combination of early sunrise and      late sunset, though the very earliest sunrise and the very      latest sunset occur about a week earlier and a week later,      respectively, as seen from mid-Northern latitudes of Earth.      The June solstice is also when the Sun rises and sets      farthest North and passes higher in the United States sky      at 12:00 P.M. than at any other time of year. Sun enters      the astrological sign Cancer at the solstice. Sun enters      constellation Gemini, 1 P.M. EDT.    </p>    <p>      <strong>23</strong>    </p>    <p>      FULL MOON (Rose Moon, Flower Moon, Strawberry Moon), 7:32      A.M. EDT - this is the lowest Full Moon of the year,      because Full Moon is always opposite from the Sun in the      sky and the Sun is now farthest North and at its highest.      Midsummer's Eve (and St. John's Day).    </p>    <p>      <strong>24</strong>    </p>    <p>      Midsummer's Day (and St. John's Day).    </p>    <p>      <strong>28</strong>    </p>    <p>      Latest sunset at 40° North latitude (8:33 P.M. daylight      saving time).    </p>    <p>      <strong>30</strong>    </p>    <p>      LAST QUARTER MOON (a second time this month in the Eastern      time zone), 3:32 P.M. EDT.    </p>    <h3>      July    </h3>    <p>      <strong>1</strong>    </p>    <p>      Canada Day    </p>    <p>      <strong>2</strong>    </p>    <p>      Midpoint of the year (at noon - actually 1 P.M.      daylight savings time - in your zone).    </p>    <p>      <strong>3</strong>    </p>    <p>      Dog Days begin according to one tradition, which says they      end August 11; climax of the Battle of Gettysburg (1863).    </p>    <p>      <strong>4</strong>    </p>        <p>      Independence Day. This day in 1776 Thomas Jefferson      reported that at 2 P.M. in Philadelphia it was cloudy with      a temperature of - what else? - 76°F.      Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and George Washington were all      avid weather-watchers who took temperature readings almost      every day for long periods of their lives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5</strong>    </p>    <p>      Earth at aphelion (farthest from the Sun), 5 P.M. EDT.      Since Earth's distance from the Sun doesn't vary too      greatly, the amount by which one of its hemispheres is      tilted toward the Sun is more important in determining      weather. Right now the Northern hemisphere is tilted toward      the Sun by almost its maximum so we get hot weather. Also,      a pretty sight this morning, rather low in the East around      5 A.M.: the Moon just below Mars with the Pleiades star      cluster above them and the star Aldebaran somewhat below      them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8</strong>    </p>    <p>      NEW MOON, 5:37 P.M. EDT.    </p>    <p>      <strong>10</strong>    </p>    <p>      Venus 1.1° North of the star Regulus - a fine      conjunction, well up in the west at nightfall (the pair are      fairly close to each other for several days).    </p>    <p>      <strong>11</strong>    </p>    <p>      Moon fairly near Venus and Regulus this night.    </p>    <p>      <strong>14</strong>    </p>    <p>      Neptune at opposition (nearest to us and brightest for the      year-but you still need binoculars, country skies, and a      detailed map, such as in the April issue of <em>Sky &      Telescope</em> magazine); Bastille Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>15</strong>    </p>    <p>      FIRST QUARTER MOON, 9:11 P.M. EDT; Moon passes very near      the star Spica about 10 P.M. EDT; St. Swithin's Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>16</strong>    </p>        <p>      Uranus at opposition (nearest to us and brightest for the      year, but not greatly brighter than Neptune - see      July 14 entry above - so same requirements are needed      to see it). Mercury at greatest elongation in morning sky      but quite low in the East-Northeast around 5 A.M.    </p>    <p>      A much easier sight than Uranus or Mercury is Jupiter. The      second brightest planet after Venus, Jupiter is fairly near      the Moon at nightfall. If you have a telescope, identify      and observe Jupiter tonight, in preparation for the coming      nights when pieces of a comet hit it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>18</strong>    </p>    <p>      Mars over 5° North of the star Aldebaran - look      for them, Mars slightly slightly dimmer, fairly low in the      East around 5 A.M. At nightfall turn a telescope on Jupiter      in hopes of seeing effects from the impact of pieces of      Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 as they begin to hit. This series of      impacts - which go on for approximately 6 days      - may include a few blasts that will cause notable      changes in the clouds of Jupiter and their brightest moons      will be easy to see in any telescope. The impacts will all      occur just over the edge on the far side of Jupiter, but      their distortions of Jupiter's clouds may last many      minutes, hours, days, months, or years!    </p>    <p>      <strong>20</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sun enters constellation Cancer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>22</strong>    </p>    <p>      FULL MOON (Thunder Moon, Hay Moon, Buck Moon), 4:15 P.M.      EDT: Sun enters astrological sign Leo, 10 P.M. EDT.    </p>    <p>      <strong>23</strong>    </p>    <p>      Last pieces of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>25</strong>    </p>    <p>      Twenty-fifth anniversary of Man's first steps on the Moon:      Colonel Neil Armstrong and "Buzz" Aldrin of NASA's Apollo      11 mission.    </p>    <p>      <strong>30</strong>    </p>    <p>      LAST QUARTER MOON, 8:41 A.M. EDT.    </p>    <p>      <strong>31</strong>    </p>    <p>      Lammas Eve.    </p>
