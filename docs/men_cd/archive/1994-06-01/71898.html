                		    <h5 id="byline">      By Gail Damerow    </h5>    <p>      <em><strong>How to enjoy fruit and vegetables from winter      to spring by planning a year-round garden.</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Most gardeners I know plant in late spring and then sit      back and watch their gardens grow. Our family, on the other      hand, keeps planting and planting and planting. As a      result, while others complain about the price of lettuce,      we're enjoying virtually free salads. While others are      using up the last of the season's green tomatoes, our      family is still slicing into juicy, ripe, freshly picked      tomatoes.<br />      <br />      No, we aren't gardening geniuses. We just happen to prefer      fresh vegetables, so we take advantage of every trick in      the book to keep our veggies growing. Here are 14 ways you      too can extend your gardening season.<br />      <br />      <strong>1. Know your garden's microclimate.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most climate maps cover areas that are too broad to be      useful for any specific garden. The latest USDA map is      better than the old one but still isn't truly accurate. The      only way to know your garden's microclimate is to keep your      own records over the years. But, since the weather is never      the same two years in a row, even your own records will, at      best, provide averages.<br />      <br />      Not only does the weather change from year to year, but      mini areas within your garden may differ significantly from      one another. Is part of your garden shaded by trees or      buildings? Is some area shielded from cold or drying wind      by a fence or shrubs? Are there low spots where cold air      and frost readily settle?    </p>    <p>      Select vegetables described as growing best in your general      climate. If your garden has more than one microclimate, try      different varieties in different spots. Some may do better      than others in certain spots; some may do better one year      than in the next.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2. Plant often.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Successive planting is the best way to stretch the harvest      over a period of time. One successive planting method is to      simultaneously sow seeds and set out started seedlings of      the same variety. The transplants will be ready for harvest      before the direct-seeded veggies are.    </p>        <p>      Another successive planting method is to replant at      periodic intervals. Sow radishes and spinach once a week;      sow beans, beets, carrots, scallions, and salad greens      every two weeks; sow cucumbers and summer squash once a      month. Since you can't tell in advance just how warm or      cool the season will be, keep planting until seeds stop      sprouting well.    </p>    <p>      A third method for ensuring a successive harvest is to sow      seeds of several different varieties that mature at      different rates. Planting rows of different varieties is an      easy way to extend the harvest of corn and peas. For      carrots, radishes, and salad greens, you have the option of      mixing the seeds of different varieties together and      planting them all in the same row.    </p>    <p>      In our garden we get the greatest variety of salad greens      over the longest period of time by both mixing different      kinds of lettuce seed together and planting the mix every      two weeks. We do the same with radishes. When our weather      suddenly turns hot (as it does every year), some varieties      will run for cover, while others continue supplying us with      fresh salads for a few weeks longer.    </p>    <p>      Continue successive planting as the weather warms,      replacing spring crops with summer crops and summer crops      with fall veggies. Besides extending the harvest,      successive planting has an additional advantage - it      keeps the soil productive and thereby discourages weeds.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">		<div class="image">      <img src="../images/144-058-01tab.jpg" alt="144-058-01tab.jpg" width="231" height="274" />    </div>    </div>    <p>      <strong>3. Hit weeds early and hard.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Vegetables grow fastest and produce the greatest yields if      they don't have to compete with weeds. Yet any time you      work the soil, you encourage weeds to grow. As soon as you      notice weeds sprouting along your newly planted rows, hoe      them down. Repeat in two weeks, and again two weeks later.      After that, you should have no more than the occasional      weed, especially if you tuck veggies into a thick layer of      mulch as they grow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4. Use raised beds.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Raised beds can be temporary soil mounds with tamped-down      paths between them or they can be permanent rectangular      boxes made of timber, stone, blocks, or bricks. They can be      only a few inches high, or high enough to let you      comfortably sit on the edge while you sow and weed. They      can be 4-foot squares or 4- by 20-foot rectangles.    </p>    <p>      Whatever their design, beds raise soil above the path,      where it isn't walked on. Since it doesn't get compacted,      it doesn't need frequent tilling. Turning the soil brings      weed seeds to the surface where they more readily      germinate. With less tilling, you get fewer weeds, and the      ones that do pop up are easy to pull (because you don't      have to stoop as far and because the soil remains loose).      Since weeds are less likely to grow to maturity and make      more weed seeds, using raised beds helps to break the      perpetual weeding cycle that discourages all too many      gardeners.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5. Trellis.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Trellising veggies whenever possible makes it easier to      weed and mulch around the base of plants, as well as giving      you more room to plant additional crops. Some vegetables      you can successfully trellis are peas and beans (climbing,      not bush, varieties), indeterminate tomato varieties, and      vining types of cucumber, melon, winter squash, and      zucchini. If large melons or squash get heavy and start      pulling on the vine, fashion slings from stretchy material,      such as worn-out nylon stockings.    </p>        <p>      <strong>6. lnterplant.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Interplanting, or combining compatible vegetables in the      same row, has several advantages. It lets you extend the      harvest by planting fast-growing veggies among slow      growers. By the time the slow growers need more room, the      fast growers are done and gone.    </p>    <p>      Another way interplanting extends the harvest is by letting      you grow cool-season veggies into the warmer months. Shade      created by big-leafed crops like cabbages, tall crops like      corn, or trellised crops like beans can improve summer      growing conditions for cool weather crops like radishes and      lettuce.    </p>    <p>      Interplanting, like successive planting, maximizes yields      by keeping your garden soil occupied so weeds can't find a      foothold. It also discourages plant pests by varying the      environment. As a bonus, in seasons when one crop doesn't      do particularly well, the interplanted crop should still      give you something to harvest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7. Rotate.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Crop rotation means nothing more than not planting      vegetables from the same family in the same place twice in      a row. Since all plants within the same family experience      the same problems, rotated crops suffer less from pests,      diseases, and soil deficiencies. They therefore tend to      produce over a longer period than plants grown in the same      tired soil time after time.    </p>    <p>      Here, again, raised beds offer an advantage. You can set up      a crop-rotation plan and use it year after year, simply by      shifting your planting scheme from one bed to the next.      Because legumes fix nitrogen in the soil, whenever possible      alternate a legume veggie in one of the other families.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8. Water only when necessary.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Water your garden only as necessary to makeup the      difference between rainfall and the amount of water your      plants need. If your garden soil is rich in organic matter,      as it should be, it will trap and hold most of the water      that falls on it without need for much intervention.      Mulching heavily around plants ensures that water won't      evaporate too quickly, but will remain available to the      root systems. Your plants will continue to grow, even      during spells of moderately dry weather.    </p>    <p>      More gardeners tend to overwater than to underwater.      Watering too much encourages roots to remain just below the      soil's surface, instead of stretching downward. As a      result, root systems have less access to nutrients in the      soil that are needed for plants to grow and thrive. Roots      also dry out more quickly and need to be watered more      often.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes overwatering is not the gardener's fault, but      nature's. Too much rain causes carrots, tomatoes, and      cabbages to split, and can cause onions and potatoes to rot      in the ground. Here, again, raised beds offer a distinct      advantage - they let you easily cover water-sensitive      crops when rainfall doesn't seem to let up.    </p>    <p>      To tell if your garden needs watering, pick up a bunch of      soil in your hand and squeeze. If it doesn't hold together      when you open your hand, get out the soaker hose. When you      do irrigate, apply a generous amount of water to penetrate      to the root zone. Check your work by using a hand trowel to      make sure the water has soaked down 6 to 8 inches.    </p>    <p>      Always water early in the day, for two reasons: first, so      plant leaves have a chance to dry out in the warmth of the      sun, thereby discouraging bacterial and fungal diseases      that can affect shaded plants; second, so the soil that's      been cooled by water has a chance to warm up again before      the next moisture arrives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Don't Overdo It!</strong><br />      More gardeners tend to overwater than underwater.    </p>    <p>      <strong>9. Watch for early frost.</strong>    </p>    <p>      In years when early sporadic frost strikes, sometimes all      your garden needs to keep growing well into fall is a night      or two of vigilant frost protection. Although they're      expensive, floating row covers (such as Remay) are ideal      because they let in light and air during the day. Plastic      sheeting will work, as will old bed sheets, provided you      remove them during sunny days so they don't trap in too-hot      air. You'll also have to prop them away from plants, since      plastic collects puddles and wet sheets get heavy and can      break off plant stems.    </p>    <p>      One way to keep plastic or bed sheets above plants is to      drape them over a portable tunnel frame fashioned from PVC      pipe. The frame can do double duty in the warmest      weather-covered with shade cloth instead of sheeting, it      can be used to protect tender salad greens from the      summer's hot sun.    </p>    <p>      <strong>10. Build a cold frame.</strong>    </p>        <p>      If you are concerned with sensitive crops as fall weather      begins, building a cold frame is an excellent idea. A cold      frame is nothing more than a shallow rectangular box with      no bottom and with a cover of glass, plastic, or      fiberglass. The sides can be wood or straw bales, and      should slope toward the south to capture the sun's warming      rays. Fill the cold frame with good garden loam (see "The      Dirt on Dirt," issue #136).    </p>    <p>      Since plants go dormant at low temperatures, get your cold      frame up and running well into summer so your cool-season      veggies will be ready for picking in winter and early      spring. Then, either let them go dormant or keep new ones      growing by turning your cold frame into a hot bed with soil      heating tape. First lay down a sheet of Styrofoam      insulation, cover it with a layer of sand, add a layer of      soil, lay down the heat tape (as directed on the label),      add another layer of sand, and cover it with 6 to 8 inches      of loam. Connect the heating tape to a switched outlet, and      your cold frame will become a hot bed at the mere flip of a      switch.    </p>		       <p>      Next spring, use your cold frame to get a jump on the      planting season. When you're ready to transplant seedlings      to the garden, leave a few behind in the cold frame to      mature earlier than the transplanted veggies; after the      danger of frost has past, remove the cover and let the cold      frame function as a raised bed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>11. Start seeds indoors.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Even if you don't have a cold frame, you can get a      three-month jump on next year's planting season by starting      seeds indoors. We find that seedlings we start ourselves      take off like a shot when they're transplanted, compared to      store-bought seedlings that fritter away, sometimes growing      slowly and bearing poor fruit, and sometimes just up and      dying (see "Starting Seeds Indoors," issue #136). You'll be      ready for spring planting, while at the same time doing      your bit for recycling, if you start saving empty yogurt      containers, plastic cups, and the like to hold your      seedlings.    </p>    <p>      Window-sill seedlings grow spindly and otherwise don't do      nearly as well as seedlings started under a light. A      whitelight fluorescent tube will cost you much less than a      nursery grow-light, and you can save even more by watching      for sales on tubes and fixtures during bargain seasons of      summer and fall.    </p>    <p>      Set up your nursery about three months before the last      expected frost-free date in your area. Continue starting      seeds of different kinds (see "Starting Seeds Indoors."      chart on page 60) until about a month before the expected      last frost in your area. Transplant seedlings into slightly      larger pots when they reach 3 to 4 inches, and again when      they reach 6 to 8 inches. By the time your garden soil      warms up enough for transplanting, you'll have sturdy      plants with strong roots.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Start Your Own Seeds</strong><br />      Our home-started seedlings flourish while the store bought      seedlings fritter away    </p>    <p>      <strong>12. Plant early.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Be prepared to plant in spring as early as soil dampness      and warmth allow. Because raised beds hold garden loam      above normal soil level, they let the loam warm and drain      faster than the surrounding soil. You can therefore work in      a raised bed several weeks before soil conditions would      otherwise allow you to get out into the garden. If you      don't already use raised beds, map out an area for one or      more and set them up as soon as this year's crops are      harvested.    </p>    <p>      Whether or not you opt for raised beds, ensure the success      of early plantings by using a soil thermometer to monitor      soil temperature. Some seed packets and mailorder catalogs      offer information on the best soil temperatures for      germinating the particular varieties you select, so a small      investment in a thermometer now can pay off in healthy      plants at harvest time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>13. Protect plants from late frost.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Be prepared to protect next spring's early plantings if a      late frost threatens. Start now by stocking up on grocery      bags, One-gallon plastic bleach jugs, milk cartons, and so      forth. Upside-down paper bags, anchored, work well for      individual seedlings, but must be removed during the day.      One-gallon plastic bleach or milk jugs, with the bottoms      cut off, are a popular choice because they're cheap and      they have caps that can be unscrewed during the day to      release excess heat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>14. Plan ahead.</strong>    </p>    <div class="sidebar">     <div class="image">      <img src="../images/144-058-01tab2.jpg" alt="144-058-01tab2.jpg" width="327" height="546" />    </div>		     </div>    <p>      You can't get a jump start on the season if you don't have      the seeds you need when time comes to plant them. Since our      local stores don't display seeds until weeks after we think      seeds ought to be started, we do a lot of our garden      shopping by mail (see "Mail-Order Mania," issue #129).    </p>    <p>      Buying by mail, however, can be more expensive than      purchasing locally. One way to save money and have the      seeds you want when you want them is to grow      open-pollinated (nonhybrid) varieties this year and save      their seeds for next year. Although you'll have to observe      certain precautions - like planting open-pollinated      varieties of like kind far enough apart to avoid      crosspollination - you'll enjoy other advantages      besides saving money.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, plants successfully grown in your garden      from year to year will become acclimated to your particular      area, and will therefore do better than seeds originating      elsewhere. For another thing, the plants will always grow      true to form, so you shouldn't have any surprises. Nothing      can throw a garden plan farther off than purchasing seeds      of a favorite variety, only to find that it's been      "improved" and no longer behaves the same as it once did.    </p>    <p>      If harvesting your own seed seems like too much bother, you      can still save money and have seeds when you need them by      watching for local sales in midsummer and purchasing enough      seeds to carry you into the next season.    </p>    <p>      Whether you buy seeds or harvest your own, make sure they      maintain a high germination rate by storing them in a cool,      dry place out of sunlight. An ammunition box -      available at any military surplus outlet - makes an      ideal seed storage container. So does an insulated picnic      cooler (without the ice pack, of course). Add a packet of      powdered milk, silica gel, or other drying crystals to keep      humidity from rising above the ideal 6 percent minimum.    </p>    <p>      If you plan ahead, plant early, and keep on planting, you      too can enjoy eating tons of fresh-picked veggies while      everyone else grumbles about the high price of produce.    </p>    <p>      Illustrations by Joel Popadics    </p>    <p>      <em>Resources:</em>    </p>    <p>      The New Organic Grower's Four-Season Harvest <em>by Eliot      Coleman showes you, as the subtitle suggests, "how to      harvest fresh, organic vegetables from your home garden all      year long" - $17.95 from Chelsea Green Publishing      Co., PO Box 130, Post Mills, VT 05058-0130,      802-333-9073.</em>    </p>    <p>      Cold-Climate Gardening <em>by Lewis Hill is a 320-page      paperback on "how to extend your growing season by at least      30 days" - $12.95 from Storey Communications,      Schoolhouse Road, Pownal, VT 05361, 800-441-5700.</em>    </p>
