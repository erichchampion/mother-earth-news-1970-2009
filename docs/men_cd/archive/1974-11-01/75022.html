                     <h5 id="byline">     by FEEDBACK FROM JOHN SEWARD    </h5>    <p>      I just finished reading the article "Following the Plow" in      MOTHER NO. 27 and I have a few tips that might be useful to      anyone who wants to learn to plow with horses.    </p>    <p>      Here in Pennsylvania Dutch country we call a      "middle-breaker" a "scorer" and a "turning plow" a      "moldboard plow". There are different-sized moldboard plows      for different uses. To find the size, measure across the      bottom from the landside to the part of the share that is      farthest from the landside. An eight-inch plow is for one      horse, a ten-inch for two horses and a twelve-inch for      three. (When you measure, be sure to allow for wear.)    </p>    <p>      If you plow with one horse you have a choice of where the      animal will walk-in the last furrow you made or right      next to it-according to which way you swing the beam      (if it's wood) or where you hook the tree on a steel beam      plow.    </p>    <p>      From there on, simply follow the instructions in the      chapter on tillage in <em>Grow It!</em> (see MOTHER NO.      17). You have to steer a walking plow to keep the width of      the furrow you are cutting even. To do so, lean the plow to      the left and it will go to the right, or lean it to the      right and it will go left. When you get to the end of the      field, lay the plow on its side so it won't dig in as you      travel across the headland.    </p>    <p>      If you're going to do much farming with horses you ought to      buy a team. There is not much you can do with one horse,      and one-horse machinery is rare. If you do own a team, you      should try to get a sulky plow. They have wheels so that      you can ride, and are very much easier to use than walking      plows. Sulky plows are still manufactured at a place in      Indiana. <em>(Were not sure what company John has in mind .      . . but we understand that such implements are available      from The Oliver Corporation, 400 West Madison, Chicago,      Illinois 60606. -MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Rust on the wearing parts of a plow can increase its draft      considerably, so when you're finished plowing for the      season, take a good handful of grease and smear it on the      moldboard, share and landside to preserve the polished      surface until the next year.    </p>    <p>      If you think you can save money by buying a young draft      horse and training it yourself, don't. Leave the breaking      to the professionals. For a beginner to try to teach a      green horse would be disastrous.    </p>    <p>      Plowing isn't actually too hard . . . just be sure to      secure a helper to drive the horse for your first attempt.      I am only 13 years old and I can plow.    </p>
