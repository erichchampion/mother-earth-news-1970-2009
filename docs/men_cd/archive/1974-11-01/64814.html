                        <h3>      WITH A CHAIN SAW    </h3>    <p>      Instead of putting posts in the ground for a wood rack (as      Tom Murray suggested on page 29 of MOTHER NO. 25), you can      make a holder that looks like a sled. The runners can be      two 2 X 8's, about 7 feet long and 2-1/2 feet apart. Round      off the bottom corners for the front and nail a      2-X-something crosspiece at each end and in the middle.      Then attach three 2 X 4 uprights, about 4 feet high, on      each side.    </p>    <p>      Fill your rack full of poles, crank your saw and go to      work! You can cut 20-foot trunks in your contraption if you      saw first one end, then the other, to keep them balanced. I      can turn out a cord of wood an hour this way. I know it      sounds unbelievable, but it's true.    </p>    <p>      Dan Shipman<br />      Grant City, Mo.    </p>    <h3>      AND WITHOUT    </h3>    <p>      I have to disagree with Tom Murray's article "Twice the      Wood in Half the Time" (MOTHER NO. 25). I don't intend this      as a wisecrack, but just how much wood have you guys cut to      let it get past?    </p>    <p>      OK, this is what I mean. You might be able to drive a      post-hole 18 inches deep by prying a dig bar back and forth      in Iowa, where they have six inches of topsoil . . . but      most of us back-to-thelanders don't live in Iowa. You dig a      hole, any hole, and the rock in there usually brings you up      short with a jar and a lousy string of profanity. And you      have to go deeper than 18 inches to set a post right. As a      matter of fact, two feet is a bare minimum. Frost during a      heavy winter goes 18 to 24 inches deep and the bottom of      your post had better be below frost line or you get      <em>heaving . . . which</em> is one more excuse to teach      the kids all those words you don't want them to use yet.    </p>    <p>      Another thing: You'd better <em>durn well not</em> hit the      saw's chain in the dirt. Chains cost $15.00 to $25.00, and      a rock can rip off a set of teeth faster than you realize .      . . and there the kids are, eagerly standing by, adding to      their verbal skills. So don't ever run into the ground.    </p>    <p>      Next, Murray's method leaves you with six or eight good      fenceposts cluttering up a space you use only a few days a      year. A man can cut and cord perhaps three cords a day. You      use six cords a year, if you have good wood and not pine.      You cord wood when you have a few hours to spare. The rest      of the time, the posts just stand there and clutter. I      don't know, maybe they'd make a good place to grow pole      beans or sump'n . . . but if the uprights aren't locust,      they'll rot out in five or ten years.    </p>    <p>      And then, and <em>then</em> comes the real boner. The      fellow in the two drawings is cutting some nice wood. But      if he'd let the darn trees grow up, he'd have ten times as      much to burn. Maybe he was clearing land. That's a waste .      . . just how much acreage does he need to live on? If those      trunks in the rack are oak or maple or any good hardwood,      they're maybe 15 years old. He should have let them be for      his middle age. And if they're locust or a scrub tree,      that's a lot of good fenceposts going up in smoke.    </p>    <p>      It all boils down to this: Most firewood I've cut is      timber, not saplings. The tree is anywhere from 18 inches      to three feet across, and it isn't possible to move the      fellow . . . you have to cut him in pieces right there, so      that you can then put a splitting wedge to 'im. And which      is easier: to drag a pile of 20foot poles out of the woods,      or to load your cut and split wood on a sledge, say "Hei'a"      and let the horses (or tractor) haul it out over the road?    </p>    <p>      Now I come to an essential point: The whole notion of doing      the job by the pole contraption in the article is alien to      the fact of what <em>you</em> , as a person, are doing. If      we decide to cut wood, certain rules must apply to the game      . . . and the first is that it should <em>be</em> a game:      something enjoyable which we do by choice, not by      necessity. Yes, it <em>is</em> necessary to get the wood      in, but why not do the job when we choose to (rather than      when the house is at 40Â° and the woodshed empty)? If      the act itself is worth doing, then it's worth doing      enjoyably. Cutting wood is no more of a drudgery than      weeding the garden, and I don't think I have to launch into      a Rodale essay on the joy of gardening to make that point.    </p>    <p>      Cutting wood, after all, is the best excuse to get out in      the woods without violating our Puritan ethic (we have a      <em>right</em> to be there, remember?). We mingle with the      forest, we move over it, culling and pruning and being at      one with it. This isn't a very heavy trip . . . any dirt      farmer does the same, except that he doesn't usually wax      poetic about the job.    </p>    <p>      My last comment relates to the basic belief of most      homesteaders: simplicity with economy. The act of using a      chain saw is complicated by oil, gas, chains, noise      pollution, <em>danger</em> . An axe and a crosscut saw,      with a pair of sawhorses, are preferable by far . . .      because the tool which is most adequate to do the job, with      the least complexity, is the right tool to use.    </p>    <p>      A tractor may outperform a brace of horses, but a team will      comfortably and adequately care for the needs of the      average family and leave a nice surplus for market. Do you      want to be a Kansas wheat agribusiness, or a part of the      earth? A matter of personal taste, finally.    </p>    <p>      And that suggests some other points: When all the gas is      gone, what do you do with your combines and your tractors?      When the air is foul and stinks in your head, what will      your children have to live with? When you finally come to      die, what memories will you carry into the sod with you:      ghostly images of a tractor that belched and roared 12      hours a day, or of the gentle tinkle of horses' harness?    </p>    <p>      Our time on earth in tenuous and fleeting, and is gone      before any of us realizes it. Simplicity brings us closer      to the fundamentals of all life, and is more akin to our      basic feelings. People in the city are divorced from life      and die regretting it . . . or become automatons. We of the      land shall endure.    </p>    <p>      J.<br />      West Virginia    </p>
