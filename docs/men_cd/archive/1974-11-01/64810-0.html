        FIGURE 3. PARTS OF DEFLECTOR. The deflector must designed to fit the height and diameter of the barrel section The aluminum top and bottom of the deflector must be b thirds of the diameter of the barrel's interior. The cylinder should have a diameter of between three and four inches. 1 height of the completed deflector should be one-half the height of the interior of the oven. The pattern shown for the cylinder describes a dotted line down the right-hand side. This r should overlap the opposite edge and be welded for a tight s,: The half-inch cuts on the top and bottom of the cylinder ;: tern will be folded outward at a 90-degree angle to act as additional tional support for the aluminum top. The weld between the of the deflector and the top of the cone should be made from the inside. The bottom deflector plate will have a circular h cut in it (note dotted line) the same diameter as the completed cylinder. A secure weld here will give the support needed for heavy load of the roasting pan and its contents. The deflector is best welded to the aluminum table in order to ins a tight seal. If extra support is needed, braces can be welded screwed along the edges of the deflector's top and hots; These braces should not number more than four an interfere with the placement of the cooking container
