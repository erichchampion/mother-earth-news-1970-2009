                    <h5 id="byline">      by LYNN COOK    </h5>    <p>      Here we are, in the middle of our third winter in the woods      of coastal British Columbia. We're living on our boat while      we wait for three and a half feet of snow to melt so that      we can begin building our cabin and clearing ground for the      garden.    </p>    <p>      The nearest town-or person for that matter-is      15 miles away across open water that's pretty vicious most      of the winter. It isn't safe for us to travel much. So we      three-man, woman and baby-child-are a very      isolated unit . . . one warm pocket of a home in a great      area of trees and rocks and ocean. And we're sufficient      unto ourselves, because we plan it that way: We have the      warmth of two wood stoves, lots of food and our own sources      of amusement.    </p>    <p>      To judge from Positions and Situations, there are many      people who "just gotta get away" . . . who are considering      a life like ours, and will one day find themselves likewise      in total isolation, dependent on their own resources. I'm      writing this report for them, based on the knowledge I've      gained from three years in the bush.    </p>    <p>      To prevent starvation-or, at the very least, loss of      morale-it's most important to be like the squirrels      in autumn and lay up enough food to last extended periods      of time. Presumably you won't be able to go shopping every      week once you're "back of beyond" . . . and if you're      really trying to get away from civilization, you won't want      to. So . . . before you enter upon your life in the woods,      you get yourself a bunch of supplies.    </p>    <p>      Here's how we manage the business of stocking up. Each year      we work for a short time (six weeks last summer) and buy      the following:    </p>    <h3>      OUR BASIC STAPLES    </h3>    <p>      80 pounds large-flake slow-cooking oats<br />      150 pounds whole wheat (we have a grinder)<br />      10 pounds cornmeal<br />      10 pounds assorted grains (millet, rye, etc.)<br />      100 pounds brown rice<br />      40 pounds whole-wheat pasta (too much, actually)<br />      50 pounds (approximately) assorted legumes: split peas,      black-eyed peas, lentils, kidney, navy, lima and garbanzo      beans, etc.<br />      150 pounds non-instant powdered skim milk<br />      32 pounds margarine (one case)<br />      100 pounds brown sugar<br />      30 pounds honey<br />      7 gallons cooking oil<br />      10 100-fluid-ounce cans tomato paste<br />      25-pound bucket peanut butter<br />      12 pounds cheese<br />      5 pounds yeast<br />      10 pounds baking powder potatoes, carrots, cabbages,      turnips    </p>    <p>      We order most of these things in bulk at good prices from      the Big City many miles away and have them shipped up at      additional cost. In the case of some items (oil, tomato      paste), it's more practical to pay higher rates at the      local market than to lay out money for shipping. Also, our      neighboring dealer can get certain foods in bulk if we      order them in advance. All of which may not concern you if      you live on a road, have a truck and can go and get the      supplies you need.    </p>    <p>      At first it seems incredible to purchase so much food at      once . . . but you're buying to last a long time. How long?      That's hard to say definitely, because the answer depends      on the number of people in your family, how much you live      off the land (at times you can't), how many guests and pets      you feed and, often, circumstances over which you have      little or no control . . . like mold running rampant or the      dog getting into the powdered milk. (Last winter, mice ate      a hole into a 25-pound cloth sack of brown rice we had      stored on the rafters. We awoke late at night to the softly      slurred sound of kernels raining into the woodpile.) In our      own case, the above list is about a year's supply of      edibles . . . as long as the      semi-perishables-margarine, potatoes and other      vegetables-are replenished betweentimes.    </p>    <p>      Note that neither the list nor the quantities thereon are      right for everyone. Tomato paste, peanut butter and      margarine-for instance-aren't absolutely      essential but are really fine to have if you can afford      them. And if you don't use sugar, you'll have to compensate      with more honey for cooking. Or you may not need so much      powdered milk (we have a one-year-old son). Still, the      foods I've named are the ones that have kept us satisfied      for three years, so they might be a fair guideline for you      who are now planning toward the woods life.    </p>    <p>      Of course, basic staples aren't all we get on our supply      trips. To liven up the plain raw material we buy spices,      sauces and herbs. With these, and ingenuity, it's possible      to create any number of different tastes from the same old      food. Don't underestimate the need for variety in the diet!      Overly repetitious meals can become very "so-whatish",      which is bad for health and spirit. Although there's almost      no limit to the resources with which you can dress up your      eating, the following will give you a lot of scope:    </p>    <h3>      HERBS    </h3>    <p>      Garlic (cloves or powder)<br />      Onions (we buy 50 pounds at once because I like them so      much)    </p>    <h3>      SAUCES    </h3>    <p>      Soy sauce (for Chinese meals)<br />      Vinegar (for salads, sweet and sour dishes, marinades,      mayonnaise and pickling)<br />      Ketchup (nice to have around)    </p>    <h3>      SPICES    </h3>    <p>      Salt<br />      Pepper (cayenne, black or whole peppercorns)<br />      Curry powder (for Indian food)<br />      Chili powder (for Mexican dishes)<br />      Oregano or basil (for Italian food)<br />      Cinnamon, cloves, allspice, nutmeg (for baking)<br />      Paprika (for good taste and color)    </p>    <p>      How about vitamins? Clean air and water, whole grains in      our diet and the sight of lots of trees do much for our      physical and mental health . . . but we still get a few      items to help us along, especially in winter:    </p>    <h3>      SUPPLEMENTS    </h3>    <p>      Rose hips or vitamin C tabs (in summer, greens and berries      provide enough vitamin C)<br />      Cod-liver oil (vitamins A and D)<br />      Blackstrap molasses (for iron . . . I put it in bread,      biscuits and cookies)<br />      Brewer's yeast (B-complex vitamins)<br />      Wheat germ (vitamin E)    </p>    <p>      There's plenty of protein in powdered milk, soybeans,      cheese, game and fish, and the first two items also contain      calcium. In fact, the basic staples-plus the      supplements I've listed-provide us with a pretty      healthful diet.    </p>    <p>      In almost every load of our supplies there's also a very      nonessential bunch of stuff . . . the foods we buy, if we      can afford them, after the necessities are safely stowed      away. Such luxuries are simply great for bolstering the      spirit. For us, they often include:    </p>    <h3>      EXTRAS    </h3>    <p>      Cocoa (for the hot chocolate that goes so well with a      wintry day)<br />      Raisins, dates, walnuts, coconut (to make your granola,      cookies and cakes extra special)<br />      Popcorn (need I say anything?)<br />      Coffee (an occasional pot)    </p>    <p>      Sometimes I make soy nuts for a treat, or fudge with      raisins and nuts in it.    </p>    <p>      That's the end of the shopping trip, but it's not all there      is to eating in the woods. You can stretch your food      supply, vary your diet, better your health and decrease      your "on the job" time by relying on Mother Earth to help      feed you. She will, if you work hard at it.    </p>    <p>      We hunt deer, bear, grouse and duck. We also fish for cod,      flounder and salmon and dig clams. In the spring, summer      and fall we gather mushrooms. (Cream of morel soup is a      treat we look forward to and remember.) A very good book,      <em>Guide to Common Mushrooms of British Columbia</em> by      Robert J. Bandoni and Adam F. Szczawinski-published      by A. Sutton, September 1964-helps us identify edible      varieties. ( <em>This work is out of print, but B.C.      residents might be able to find it in their local      libraries.-MOTHER.</em> <em>)</em>    </p>    <p>      Wild greens are a regular part of our diet in the spring      and summer: sheep sorrel, wild onions, dandelion, cattail,      glasswort, sea plantain, wild mint, pigweed. (Did you know      that pigweed contains 27,000 units of vitamin A per      cupful?) We pick berries too-salal, huckleberries,      blackberries, wild currants-which I dry or can or      make into jam and jelly. We're assisted in our foraging by      another good book: <em>Guide to Common Edible Plants of      British Columbia</em> by Adam F. Szczawinski and George A.      Hardy, published by A. Sutton, August 1967. ( <em>This also      is out of print.-MOTHER</em> <em>.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Gardening and domestic animals (goats, chickens) can      provide excellent food to add to your supply. Cultivating      bushland is hard work, though. Our own clearing has a      foot-thick mat of salal roots beneath its entire surface.      This will have to be removed and the soil composted,      fertilized and otherwise babied. (Most of B.C.'s forest      floor is acidic and our patch will probably need a lot of      limestone and wood ashes.) Still, the hope of lettuce,      spinach and a store of winter vegetables makes all the hard      work seem worthwhile to us.    </p>    <p>      Now then, you've finally landed in the woods with all this      food . . . and potential sources of more through foraging,      hunting, fishing and gardening. You've got a wood stove and      have made friends with it. What can you fix to eat? Here      are some suggestions:    </p>    <p>      <strong>VARIOUS BREADS:</strong> Corn bread, bannock,      biscuits, onion bread, hot cross buns, cinnamon rolls . . .      to be eaten with jam, jelly, preserves or honey.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SANDWICHES:</strong> Your homemade whole-wheat      bread plus fish or meat (if you get some), peanut butter,      cheese, honey, jam, watercress or-in garden times-tomato.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOUPS:</strong> Cream, vegetable, potato, onion,      clam or fish chowder, split pea, navy bean, lentil, tomato,      soy grit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SALADS</strong> : Rice, fish, macaroni, cabbage,      potato, wild greens, garden greens . . . with dressings      like oil and vinegar or homemade mayonnaise (if you have an      egg).    </p>    <p>      <strong>BREAKFASTS:</strong> Hot cereals of mixed grains (a      grinder is good for this), oatmeal and cornmeal mush,      hotcakes, granola, eggs, fish, meat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DESSERTS:</strong> Chocolate, rice or vanilla      puddings made with milk and cornstarch, raisin tarts,      cookies, doughnuts, berry pies, carrot cake, fudge.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAIN DISHES:</strong> Fried rice and onions,      vegetables or meat; spaghetti and garlic bread; fish and      chips; egg foo yong; potato pancakes; curried rice, split      peas or lentils; chili (with or without the <em>carne,</em>      depending on how the hunting goes); tamale pie; cabbage      rolls; pizza; vegetable, bear, deer, grouse or duck stew;      lima beans and tomatoes; baked beans; sweet and sour meat,      fish or rice; batter-fried clams, fish or grouse; creamed      rice or pasta; macaroni and cheese; baked fish; scalloped      potatoes; curried crab; roasts, chops, meat pies ....    </p>    <p>      Well, I won't go on. I only wanted to illustrate the      number, variety and quality of the meals you can eat and      stay healthy on . . . far from the land of supermarkets.    </p>    <p>      A final note: If your bread has so far come from a bakery      and your spaghetti sauce from a can, you might want to take      a cookbook along to the woods. I like Adelle Davis's      <em>Let's Cook It Right</em> (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich,      1970, $1.75 in paperback) because it teaches healthful      cooking techniques, gives recipes for game animals      (including bear) and contains charts that help us cut up      our meat (deer are most like lamb). But any cookbook with      plain down-home recipes-none of that "take one      package biscuit mix and one can mushroom gravy"      stuff-should do. Once you have no choice, you'll soon      learn to cook. I did.    </p>    <p>      A grace:    </p>    <p>      Good bread, good meat,<br />      Good God, let's eat!    </p>
