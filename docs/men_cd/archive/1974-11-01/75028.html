                    <p>      <strong>BILL PATCH-</strong> who rode a bicycle from      Minier, Illinois to Redkey, Indiana to see THE MOTHER      EARTH030-064-01.htm NEWS' methane generator last      spring-turned right around and rode back to      Minier...where he and Dale Whitley then proceeded to build      a 20,322-gallon anaerobic digester of their own. Does it      work? "We burned off 142,450 cubic feet of methane during      the four summer months," says Bill. "That's equal to      approximately 1,110 gallons of gasoline. As you can see,      it's best to get ready to use your gas before you make it:"      Look for more on the Whitley-Patch digester (with      photos:) in MOTHER NO. 31.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE METHANE IDEA CATCHES ON IN SOUTH      AMERICA</strong> : Nicole Maxwell, the first white woman to      study the miraculous herbal medicines used by remote tribes      in the Amazon Basin (see the interview with Nicole in      LIFESTYLE N0. 6), writes from Bogota, Colombia: "Organic      farming is big at the University and, this being cattle      country, everybody's building little plants to convert      manure into methane for kitchen use."    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT</strong> <strong>COSTS ONE MILLION DOLLARS      MORE</strong> t han a conventional heating, ventilating and      air-conditioning system for the same space ...but is      expected to both heat and cool a 1.3-million-squarefoot      building at a savings of 20 million kilowatt hours and      $200,000 a year? Answer: A 1.6-million-gallon concrete tank      filled with water and equipped with computer-controlled      heat exchangers. The monster vat is currently being      installed in the Toronto headquarters of Canada's giant      Ontario,Hydro-Electric Commission and its contractors think      that "other people are going to want systems like this".      Although the storage container's auxiliary valves,      compartments, plumbing, chillers and switches seem somewhat      complicated, the basic idea of the whole shebang is Harold      Hay simple: When the building's living space is too hot,      excess Btu's are pumped into the mass of water... from      which they are later extracted to once again warm the space      as desired. (Harold Hay, by the way, is the California      inventor who has successfully heated and cooled a house      with a giant roof-mounted "water bed" and a series of      moving panels which cover and/or expose the mass of liquid      to the sun.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>JOHN D'ANGELO</strong> is a young man who's done      his homework. He visited Henry Clews' Solar Wind operation      in Maine last February and bought a 2,000-watt wind-driven      generator. He contributed to the American Wind Energy      Association meeting in Detroit in September (see the short      article about that gathering elsewhere in this issue). He's      visited THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>' methane plant in Indiana and      Bill Patch's anaerobic digester in Illinois. And now      D'Angelo has set up his own company-Independent      Energy Systems-to handle wind, methane, solar, fuel      cell and other "alternative" power equipment. The IES shop      is located at 6043 Sterrettania Road, Fairview,      Pennsylvania 16415 and the telephone number is (814)      868-6211. John also deals in 10-speed bikes and backpacking      and climbing equipment. Give him a call if you live in the      Erie area.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UNCONFIRMED REPORT:</strong> Stateline Alternative      Power Systems (nope, we never heard of the firm before      either), P.O. Box 124, Custer, Washington 98240 is supposed      to have found "a small supply of small Pelton-type, impulse      turbine water wheels, new, ideal for people who want to      build their own hydroplants". The note (from Stateline)      which gave us this information was hardly decipherable and      included no prices or substantiating photographs. We hope      this lead is on the level but advise caution to anyone to      whom the news seems too good to be true. It may well be      exactly that.    </p>
