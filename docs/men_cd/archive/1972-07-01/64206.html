                <h3>      Sail On...    </h3>    <p>      Back-to-the-land may be fine for most . . . but it's not      enough for the folks who dream of shucking everything and      sailing away for the South Seas. But why dream? If you've      been indulging a private ocean fantasy, indulge no more.      Trade that castle (or yawl or ketch or schooner) in the air      for the real thing and sail on.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By BARRY FISHLER/COVER    </h5>    <p>      PHOTOS BY ANDREW SCHNEIDER/COVER    </p>    <p>      Building a concrete boat may sound pretty freaky . . . but      it works and the job is easier than you might think. The      finished craft has some real advantages over conventionally      constructed boats too: it won't rust or rot, sharp rocks      don't punch holes in it and the vessel just keeps on      getting stronger for the next 30 years or so!    </p>    <p>      What you do is build a wooden frame in the shape of the      boat you want, tack on several layers of chicken wire and      metal rods . . . and then cement over all your mistakes      (you'll have a lot more leeway with this process than if      you were working with wood or fiberglass). Once the      reinforced or "ferro" cement sets up, you'll have a      seaworthy hull that's both dirt-cheap and virtually      maintenance-free. And, if you keep the thickness of the      troweled-on pour of cement down to less than an inch (which      provides plenty of strength), the shell will weigh about      the same as a similar hull constructed of wood.    </p>    <p>      The ferrocement process seems ideally suited for that large      boat you never thought you could afford. Pool your spare      change and weekends with a few friends and you can build      the hull of a 36-foot fishing boat in 700 man-hours for a      materials cost of less than a grand! Or bring in a 50-foot      work boat hull-with deck and bulkheads-for less      than 2,000 man-hours and about $4,000.    </p>    <p>      This all sounds pretty implausible and it was . . . until      the idea of constructing watercraft from concrete was      rediscovered in the 1940's by an Italian engineer named      Nervi. The concept was later picked up by some New Zealand      experimenters and brought to North America by John Samson      when he established a ferrocement design and supply      business in Canada. Several hundred-if not      thousand-such vessels have now been launched or are      currently abuilding on this continent.    </p>    <p>      Almost any watercraft-sloops, ketches, cutters, power      cruisers, tugs, trawlers, houseboats, you name it-can      be built from ferrocement. If you're boat-wise and already      know something about this construction technique, you can      probably adapt regular boat plans to the process. Otherwise      you may want to buy drawings and instructions tailored      specifically for ferrocement. John Samson still seems to be      the best source for such information and he can be reached      at:    </p>    <p>      Samson Marine Design Enterprises, Ltd.<br />      833 River Road<br />      Vancouver, B.C.<br />      Canada    </p>    <p>      Ask for information on his ferrocement plan package      service.    </p>    <p>      Yes, it seems certain that ferrocement boats are here to      stay . . . still, a few words of caution are in order      before you dash off to "pour your own".    </p>    <p>      Many experts in the field advise against using the process      on very small designs-say an 18-foot      boat-because the thin-hulled craft that result are      not (in the experts' opinion) seaworthy. We know of several      people who've constructed exactly such designs, however,      and they have no complaint. Then again, they weren't      amateurs either.    </p>    <p>      It should also be noted-even when constructing a      bigger ferroconcrete craft-that the final cementing:      plays a very critical part in determining the ultimate      strength of the vessel. If you can find the cash to hire a      professional plasterer to do the job, by all means do so.    </p>    <p>      Now, with those warnings out of the way, turn the page to      see just how ridiculously easy it really is to pour your      own boat.    </p>
