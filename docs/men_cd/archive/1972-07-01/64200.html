    <p>
                    <h5 id="byline">By CHARLENE SONIA</h5>    <p>      If you can type, are willing to meet some standards, can      work under the pressure of a deadline and live in or near a      university or college town you can start a home      business-full or part time-doing typing for      students. If you turn out clean, crisp copy at some speed,      the business can be a good one too: once your reputation is      established you can earn up to $500 a month.    </p>    <p>      You'll find a demand for your services because college      students are required to turn in large numbers of papers,      there's a general feeling that professors prefer those      papers to be typed . . . and many students cannot type,      cannot type well or just don't have time to do the job. In      addition to simple term papers, graduate students must      often prepare a thesis as a degree requirement. This thesis      must be typewritten and meet certain standards so that it      can be microfilmed, xeroxed or printed by offset. Most grad      students either cannot type well enough to meet the      standards for a thesis; or do not leave themselves the time      to do their own typing.    </p><h3>THE MACHINE</h3>    <p>      Obviously, you'll need a typewriter if you expect to      establish yourself in this business . . . and lucky is the      person employed as a secretary by a boss who'll let her      work evenings on the office IBM. If you work out such an      arrangement, though, it's only fair that you conduct your      moonlighting efforts with your own ribbons and paper. Keep      the supply receipts, too . . . just in case someone decides      to make an issue of your activities.    </p>    <p>      If you're not already employed by an understanding boss or      do not otherwise have access to an office electric, you'll      have to rent or purchase a machine. This will increase your      overhead but will also give you more time to work and a      more flexible schedule. The pros outweigh the cons, so call      the nearest IBM office and arrange to rent or purchase an      office electric.    </p>    <p>      Why IBM? Because, in my limited experience, there isn't a      better typewriter made. The quality of its copy is high and      the machine is sturdy. You can gallop up to 120 wpm on an      IBM and it won't boggle, skip or jam. (If you type for      long, you'll hit 90 to 120 wpm on familiar word groups and      phrases and there's nothing more exasperating than a dinky      little machine that jams up and makes mistakes for you when      you can already make enough by yourself.)    </p>    <p>      Brand X typewriters drive me wild. They hop across the desk      and spin when I hit the return. At the end of every ten      lines, I have to seize such a useless device and put it      back in front of me. An IBM on a rubber typewriter mat, on      the other hand, will stay in front of you and TYPE.    </p>    <p>      Ask for an IBM Selectric. Once you've used this model, you      won't be able to return to a portable, standard or electric      machine of any other brand without great feelings of rage      and frustration.    </p>    <p>      The Selectric has an ordinary keyboard . . . but it does      not have an ordinary striking mechanism or a carriage on      which the paper rides back and forth. Instead, the sheet      being typed on remains stationary while a little ball on a      carriage runs across the paper to strike out the lines. The      balls are available in many type faces (at $18 each) and,      although you get one with the machine, you're sure to want      two or three more eventually that you can vary the      appearance of your finished work.<br />    </p>    <p>      The element design does make the Selectric different from      any other typewriter you've ever used but you'll receive an      easily understood manual with the machine. Once you read      that book, it'll only take you about two seconds to      master-and learn to love-the Selectric.    </p>    <p>      Where I live (near Sacramento, California), the prices on      an IBM Selectric range as follows:    </p>        <p>      You may be quoted slightly different figures in your area,      but I'm sure they'll run close to the above. Whatever, it's      only good business sense to be sure that you have enough      capital to tide you over a slow start . . . or that you      have a job lined up in advance that will cover your setup      costs.    </p>    <p>      When the IBM man brings your machine, ask him for an      erasure guard (a little plastic card with various-sized      holes in it). He should have a mess of them in his pocket      to give away free (they say "IBM" on them) and they're      handy little gadgets. Just place the right size hole over      an error and erase through the opening. The guard will      reduce smearing, protect adjacent characters and help you      make a faster correction.    </p>    <h3>MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      Use nothing but carbon ribbons on your typewriter. A box of      a dozen costs $11.15 and you can use each one only once.      Why expensive carbon instead of less costly, reusable      cloth? Because most people are beginning to appreciate and      expect the sharper, blacker image made by the better      ribbon. The carbon tape may not be thrifty, but it does      produce the best possible copy for reproductive purposes.      The finest work done with a cloth ribbon simply does not      have the same legibility and graduate students, especially,      have begun to specify "carbon ribbon" for their papers.    </p>    <p>      About the only other materials you'll need are a ream (500      sheets) or two of 20-lb. BOND paper, several typewriter      erasers and a correction fluid such as SNOPAQUE or      CORRECTETTE <em>(STENO-AID is also good-Ed.).</em>      Correction fluid is white and opaque. You paint it across      an error and, when the liquid dries, you can retype right      over it. Used with discretion, such corrections can be      detected only by paranoids. You can usually use as much of      the fluid as you want on term papers and reports, but be      reasonable . . . a page that weighs a pound isn't very      professional.    </p>    <p>      Visit the Graduate Divisions of the universities and      colleges in your area and ask for their sheets of rules and      regulations regarding the typing of theses. You'll find      that many schools do <em>not</em> permit use of correction      fluids and specify that any erasures be almost invisible.      Such strict standards must be maintained where theses are      microfilmed because correction fluid will mess up the      microfilming process. The rules sheets will also give you,      in great detail, each school's specifications for margins,      spacing, etc. Some customers bring a set of regulations      along with them when they deliver their rough draft . . .      but I find that it saves time and confusion if I have a      rules sheet on file for each school that I deal with.    </p>    <p>      When I have a margin requirement to meet, I take a sheet of      bond and mark the margins in with heavy black ink (see Fig.      1). Then I put the marked sheet behind the page I'm typing      and try not to run over the lines (which show through). I      also make lines three inches, two inches and one above the      <em>bottom margin</em> (not the bottom of the page) to warn      me when I'm getting to the end of the prescribed area.    </p>        <h3>ADVERTISING</h3>    <p>      Type up a small notice of offering your service enough to      fit three or four times on a single 8 1/2 x 11 sheep of      paper and have the page duplicated on a copy machine for a      few  cents. Then cut the notices apart and distribute them      liberally around your campus or campuses and student      meeting places (dormitories are the best locations of all      in which to post your ads).    </p>    <p>      Spend a few evenings putting your notices up . . . and then      check them periodically, since people sometimes remove      then; for the phone number rather than copy the      information. I've never run an ad in a student newspaper      but the rates for such periodicals are quite inexpensive      and it's worth a try.    </p>    <p>      The first assignments are the toughest and, after you've      successfully completed a few jobs, the people you've worked      or will start sending their friends around . . . and those      friends will soon send <em>their</em> friends. Word of      mouth is still the most effective form of advertising.    </p>    <h3>CUSTOMERS</h3>    <p>      A student with a term paper or an application letter to be      typed is generally calm and in no hurry. Graduate students,      however, are another story. Folks in the latter category      are usually (a) looking for a job, (b) negotiating for a      job, (c) moving, (d) trying to get some recalcitrant      committee member to sign the thesis or (e) all of these. If      a grad student botches his paper he may well lose a job, be      fined a large "late fee" or fail to get his degree for      another six months. Graduate students, then, are almost      always tired, harried and up against a deadline. I call      this complex of symptoms "Thesisosis".    </p>    <p>      A person with thesisosis is half out of his mind. Remember      this and treat him accordingly. Remember, too, that his      previous experience with secretaries (or anyone connected      with a typewriter) may well have led him to expect you to      be sullen, lazy and more than a little stupid. He      <em>hopes</em> not, of course <em>-</em> when he      comes to you, he's praying that you'll be professional,      competent, calm and honest <em>-</em> but he's ready      for a dope. So be prepared.    </p>    <p>      Let your graduate students (and all your other customers as      well) know they're in good hands when they bring a job to      you. Keep your house or office and yourself tidy. Don't do      any silly secretary imitations. Try to appear relaxed and      professional. If you have finished work handy, show it to      the potential client. Find out when his deadline is and      arrange your schedule so that you can complete his      assignment with time to spare, <em>allowing ample margin      for last-minute changes and the correction of errors.</em>    </p>    <p>      Take a good look at every manuscript before you accept the      job. If you aren't sure you can handle the assignment, turn      it down. It's better to say "no" than wind up with a      demented grad student freaking out on your hands.    </p>    <h3>QUALITY CONTROL</h3>    <p>      Proofread all your work and make neat corrections before      giving finished copy to its owner. He'll probably find      other errors and want some final changes made anyway, so      <em>-</em> again <em>-</em> allow time for each      client to bring manuscripts back for final touching up.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO CHARGE</h3>    <p>      I have each new customer list his name, address, phone      number, etc. on a simple form that I've devised (see Fig. 2      ). If the client has any special instructions, I make sure      they're entered on the same sheet. The page then becomes my      log and billing record as I complete the job ("25 pages      text at $.60, $15.00" or "7 tables at $.75, $5.25").    </p>    <p>      My usual charge is $.60 a page for straight text, $.75 each      for pages with equations, a foreign language quote,      footnotes or a table and $1.00 for every page of      bibliography. Ask around to learn the current prices in      your area and set your rates accordingly.    </p>    <p>      When a customer makes a change that requires retyping, I      charge for the second work. If I make a mistake that ruins      a page, I do not charge for retyping . . . but when there      is <em>both</em> a mistake of mine <em>and</em> a client      change on a page, I do recharge for the fresh copy.    </p>    <p>      Many people have a compulsion to mark boldly through an      error with a pen or lead pencil, when just a light pencil      notation in the margin would suffice. Since it's almost      impossible to make a neat correction over pen or pencil      marks in the text, I warn each client against noting errors      in that manner . . . and then charge for retyping a page if      he does so mark the text. Surprisingly, the need to      directly mark typos is so overpowering that many folks      quietly pay double for the privilege.    </p>    <p>      I once had a $120 check bounce and I now accept only cash      for my work. If you follow the same rule, be sure to tell      your customers ahead of time so they'll have the money      ready and with them when they come to pick up their jobs.    </p>    <p>      Before a new client completes his charge sheet, I give him      a page on which are listed my prices, my cash-only rule and      explicit directions for indicating corrections . . . just      so he won't feel that I'm trying to outwit him later when I      present my itemized bill.    </p>    <p>      If a customer questions that final bill, I go to the file      and pull a copy of his original charge sheet. Some clients      will add up the total again, but I've never had anyone      argue once they've looked the charge sheet over a second      time.    </p>    <h3>MISCELLANEOUS HELPFULS</h3>    <p>      Use good quality paper, even though it's more expensive. It      takes corrections better and is cheaper in the long run.    </p>    <p>      If you aren't willing to be meek about commas, don't type      for English majors.    </p>    <p>      When your customer isn't sure where he wants figures and      drawings (or doesn't have them done when he brings a      manuscript to you), leave off the page numbers and don't      type the table of contents. Allow enough time at the end of      the job to clean up these details.    </p>    <p>      If you're not sure what some squiggle means, work on      something else or call the customer and <em>ask.</em> If      the client can't be reached and you must continue, put down      exactly what he has in the rough draft . . . it's his      mistake, then, and not yours.    </p>    <p>      If a student makes off with your finished product without      paying you . . . a call to the graduate division or his      major professor will settle his hash.    </p>    <p>      Request a typewritten rough draft if you have difficulty      reading a person's handwriting. This will cut down on      business . . . but it'll also reduce traumas.    </p>    <p>      Use the backing sheet.    </p>    <p>      When you make a mistake, admit it and correct it.    </p>    <p>      Save your waste paper for telephone notes.    </p>    <p>      Get a dictionary and use it . . . a lot of people can't      spell.    </p>    <p>      Conducting a cash-only business saves troubling with the      Infernal Revenue Serpent . . . until they run you to      ground. Keep accurate records and avoid trouble.    </p>    <h3>FINAL WORDS</h3>    <p>      If my no-nonsense approach in this article gives you the      impression that I'm a real hard mama who spends a lot of      time jumping on my customers . . . or that this home      business is a tough one with too many exacting deadlines .      . . I'd like to close by saying "not so".    </p>    <p>      Typing is an honest and useful skill and I get a      craftsman's pleasure from setting up page after page of      neat and elegant text.    </p>    <p>      Ninety-nine percent of my clients have been pleasant and      interesting people with worthwhile papers. Many have been      so grateful for a professional job that they've returned      with both cash to pay their bill <em>and</em> a small      present. Most have recommended me to friends and some have      advised their schools to endorse my work.    </p>    <p>      You can be your own boss, improve your professional skills,      meet interesting folks and make good, honest money typing      college papers. The business will allow you to build your      own schedule around a favorite hobby or other interest . .      . while you save a nest egg for that homestead or other      "big" project.    </p>    <p>      At least that's the way it works for me.    </p>
