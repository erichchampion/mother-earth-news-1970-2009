                    <h5 id="byline">      by Jan adkins that rascal</h5>             <p>      the <strong><big>L</big>OBSTER</strong> is the regent of seafood.      Before his ferocious, spiked and clawed visage, his sweet,      white flesh, all other creatures are gastronomically      subservient. The lobster was once so cheap and plentiful      along the New England coast that windrows of wave-stranded      lobsters were pitchforked into draycarts and ploughed under      cornfields as fertilizer. Times, as your grandpa will      doubtless tell you, have changed.    </p>    <p>      Today, the lobster is worth its weight in negotiable      securities, and is the object of a jealous, regulated,      difficult search. Its price fluctuate through the year, and      the unadorned crustacean can command over $2.50 a pound.      Automated lobster boats at the edge of the continental      shelf haul great catches, but inshore the single lobsterman      still plies his strenuous, chancy trade with long hours,      simple tools, and old skills.    </p>    <p>      Our native lobster, <em>Homarus Americanus</em> , is seldom      seen below Long Island (a clawless variety inhabits warmer      waters). It thrives in cold, oxygenated water, making a      home of rocky bottoms where it can back into crevices to      defend itself. In its adolescence it is a white fingerling,      soft and vulnerable. It must grow five years    </p>        <p>      to attain market size, forming a hard exoskeleton and      shedding as it is outgrown. Lapses in lobster catch are      periodically due to the shedding cycle, since the pale,      soft "shedders" hide beneath rocks or in crevices until      their shells are prepared to defend them. Young lobsters      shed several time a year, older lobsters about once a year.    </p>    <p>      There are three lobster licenses: the home license allows      up to 10 pots (lobstertraps) for family use only, the cost      about $20.00; the commercial license allows an unlimited      number of pots, permits commercial sale, and costs      considerable more; some states issue a permit which allows      divers to catch lobsters by hand. The licenses are issued      by the state department of fisheries or wildlife, and most      states have a length-of-residency requirement. A special      note of warning: you would do better to mess with a lobster      man's woman than to mess with his gear. This is an      unquestioned wisdom afloat.    </p>        <p>      Lobstermen wish to set their pots or string of pots on a      cold, big-rocked bottom, out of navigation channels,      heavily oxygenated and little disturbed. To find good      grounds, he can consult the charts, looking for the      asterisks of rocks, and for the bottom notations "rocky"      and "boulders." He can locate ledges and outcroppings,      wrecks, and the riprap surrounding navigaion lights.      Sounding by leadline or by fathometer (which can      distinguish between sandy, rocky and bouldered bottoms) can      be useful. In clear water a water glass or scouting by a      diver might be helpful. Intimate knowledge of the bottom      and its currents is the lobsterman's most useful tool.      Local knowledge is essential. As in most      fishing-indeed, in any seawork-the newcomer      needs the help of the old guys, the old men and the      experience fishermen.    </p>        <p>      <strong><em>P</em></strong>ulling pots from a small      sailboat has been successful for a century. This lobsterman      coasts toward a pot, luffing his sails. He releases      mainsheet and jibsheet and picks up by the buoy by the line      under it with a boathook. For this wet, abrasive work he      wears neoprene gloves, boots and a bib-front rubber      overall. He will pull the pot onto the brass cap on the      rail (which, with the lath strips, protects boat and gear)      - rowing and powerboats can use a snatchblock on a davit.      He will heave the pot onto a sorting board secured      athwarthships, open the pot and discard the obvious shorts      conches, spider crabs and other intruders. He will check      every "keeper" for eggs and size it to the gauge. He will      then rebait the pot from the bait barrel behind him and      drop the pot again. He will band or peg legal lobsters and      put them in his keeping cooler. He will tighten his sheets,      fill his sails and make way to the next pots.    </p>            <p>      <strong>T</strong>he lobster pot is the primetool.      Although pots of wire, plastic, twine and metal have been      used with some success, the wooden pot is still most      popular and most prevalent. It is usually made of white oak      (ash, cedar, larch, or another available sea wood can      suffice) sawn in lath strips about 3/8" x 1 3/4", fastened      with copper or bronze nails. It has two "heads", or nets,      and a bent wire bait-holder within. (This bait can be      flounder backs from filet houses at about $20/barrel, fish      heads and backs from fish markets, or small fish caught by      the lobsterman and his family.) Many Maine pots have      rounded backs to roll upright on rocky bottoms, but are      harder to build. Each pot is weighted with bricks    </p>        <p>      to submerge it (as the pot become more waterlogged, one or      more bricks may be removed.) It opens all along the top on      hinges cut from old tires, and it latches with turning      blocks bolted to the frame or by the main rib of the cover      which snaps under one of the top laths. A stout synthetic      line is anchor-hitched securely to a main strutural piece      in a length that will allow the buoy to ride at the surface      at maximum high tide (3/16" to 5/16" propylene or dacron      will do, but line can be so formidable an investment that      your choice may be dependant on fishing depth, number of      pots, and the price you can make for line). Each buoy is      branded with the fisherman's name or initials and each      fisherman has an identifying color pattern for his buoys      rgistered with his license.    </p>            <p>      A market lobster is not measured by weight, but by the      length of carapace from eye-socket to the rear extremity. A      bronze gauge is used as reference (Massachusetts minimum      size is 3 3/16", other states differ slightly). If the      gauge fits over the carapace when fitted (harmlessly) into      the eye socket, the lobster is a "short". Any lobster      carrying eggs around the swimmerets under the tail is an      "egger" or "berry lobster", and is also illegal. Both      standards are attempts to insure lobster survival and are      rigidly enfored with spot checks afloat and careful      checking at shellfish dealers; the fine and penalties are      heavy.    </p>        <p>      A lobster is correctly approached and picked up from      behind. Held at the knuckles of the claws, the furious      crustacean cannot pinch you and his claws may then be      pegged or rubber-banded (as much to protect lobsters from      one another as to protect fishermen and gourmands).    </p>        <p>      The lobster is gill-breaher, but it will perish more      quickly in oxygen-depleted water than in open air, and      lobsters in a bucket of sea water will suffocate quickly.      There are two solutions: ciculating sea water, pumped into      and out of a tank (old lobster boats had tanks built into      their hulls with holes drilled to water outside); the      second solution is to keep them cool in the air, where they      can survive for many hours-this plastic ice chest      with ice or dry ice under a plywood plate (notes holes      drilled in lid) will keep lobsters healthy while the      lobsterman is pulling pots. The catch can be kept lively      for weeks in a "pound" or "car", a floating box moored in a      quiet cove. Lobster will keep well in the refrigerator      overnight, and they can be transported to market in fish      baskets covered with soaked burlap or seaweed.    </p>
