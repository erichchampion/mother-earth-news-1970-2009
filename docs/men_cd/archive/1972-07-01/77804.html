               		<h5 id="byline">By DENNY HUETTER</h5>     <p>      Two years ago i bought a used half-ton Chevrolet pickup      truck and started operating my own hauling business out of      the city apartment in which I lived. The enterprise was      successful right from the start and has solved the money      hassles for my lady, Christina, and me ever since.    </p>    <p>      Our good fortune is no fluke either, because Russell      Danel-a friend of mine-and two of my brothers      have nova followed my example and established prosperous      hauling operations of their own. Russell quit an office job      to become my partner three weeks after I launched my      enterprise and he now <em>has his own</em> truck and his      own business. My brothers are also quite successful, If      you're trying to get off the nine-to-five treadmill and      blossom into your-real self, then, read on. Our trade      "secrets" are all here and should work as well for you as      they have for us.    </p>    <p>      If you don't already have a truck you'll have to mount a      search. Check the newspapers, your friends . . . or walk      the streets. There are a surprisingly large number of old      pickups, vans and flatbeds, around-still in really      fine shape-for $300 or less. <em>(For</em> <em>help      in selecting and evaluating a secondhand truck see the      10-page feature in MOTHER NO. 12--Ed.)</em> One special      tip: extended side mirrors are a must no matter what truck      design you buy because a full load on any model will cut      off your vision to the rear on both sides.    </p>    <p>      When you're shopping for a vehicle, bear in mind that the      business we're discussing is a real "growth industry".      People everywhere have discards, garden trimmings and piles      of trash that they're thrilling to pay to have hauled away.      If you provide a reasonable service at a fair price, you're      almost sure to find yourself in steadily increasing demand      . . . so outfit yourself accordingly. I started with a      half-ton pickup and, within months, was forced to "expand"      by purchasing a 20-year-old three-quarter ton International      flatbed for $125. Think big.    </p>    <p>      "Ganesh", my stalwart "new" truck was a good investment. It      has three times the carrying capacity of the pickup and      decreases-by the same factor-the number of      trips I must make to the dump. To put it another way, I can      handle more calls (and make more money) in a given day with      the bigger vehicle.    </p>    <p>      Whichever you buy, pickup or flatbed, your first concern      wilt be the construction of a generously proportioned      carryall box. The cane I built for Ganesh is six feet wide,      five feet high and nine feet long. It's perfectly all right      to recycle old 2 x 4's and plywood from the dump for this      but do make sure that each side of the box is solid so that      all parts of every load you haul stay with you. Remember,      you want to be an Ecological Hygiene Transporter . . . not      a common litter rat.    </p>    <p>      And don't forget a cover for your load! I once was stopped      and fined $24 because mine was inadequate. Now I make darn      sure, with any particular cargo, that the heavy items go on      last to help weigh any loose and fight objects down, I even      use the very heaviest odds and ends to secure a selection      of old sleeping bags with which I completely cover each      load.    </p>    <p>      Check your state's laws about running-light requirements      and make sure you have a red flag to tie on the end of any      load that extends past the rear of the vehicle. Tune the      truck, change its oil and rake any necessary mirror      repairs. (I replaced Ganesh's battery and starter motor      with rebuilt parts. He's run beautifully for well over a      year now and I just feed him gas and an occasional quart of      oil.) Install those mirrors I mentioned if your machine      doesn't already have them, throw an old broom in the back,      get a city map (you'll need it for work tomorrow), call the      local newspaper and place your ad.    </p>    <p>      Bear in mind that your newspaper advertisement will      determine people's first impression of you. Make it short      and to the point. If you're a veteran it definitely will be      to your advantage to mention the fact. My ad reads:    </p>    <p>      Young veteran will haul or?<br />      Reasonable. Anytime. 432-7690.    </p>    <p>      In winter I add "any weather" and my phone stays hot. The      first day my ad appeared in the local papers three people      responded and I promptly got three hauling jobs, for which      I charged $14 apiece. Forty-two dollars my first day out .      . . I'd just found my alternative!    </p>    <p>      The question marks hooks me an assortment of odd jobs which      is especially nice around Christmas when money gets tight      and hauling becomes lean. I've set up Christmas trees,      built fences and clotheslines and once jimmied open a      second-story window for a woman who had locked herself out      of her apartment.    </p>    <p>      Kevin and Terry, the two brothers I mentioned earlier, are      both, in school and get good response by using the Word      "student" in their ads. They've also invented a system" of      perusing the "Vital Statistics" section of the newspapers      to learn who's been issued a building permit . . . and then      promptly mailing business cards to the addresses. The idea      has netted bo th of them steady work with private      contractors.    </p>    <p>      When <em>your</em> phone jangles, you should grab a pencil      and paper and take down the address and telephone number of      the potential customer. Try not to give any estimates over      the phone as you really heave to judge each hauling job by      sight to be fair to both the other party and yourself.      Drive out, take a look at the work to be done and give a      free estimate. Eight times out of ten I get the job at my      price and I usually score the rest by haggling a little      with the customer. I average $14 to $20 a load.    </p>    <p>      Although I can put a lot off swag in Ganesh's box I seldom      haul dirt or cement. Such extra-heavy material cause too      much strain on his old shocks and I have to make too many      trips to dump it. By the way, if you do decide to haul dirt      or cement, don't select an, empty lot in which to offload      such aggregate. Tlhe health department or the lard's owner      might not appreciate the idea.    </p>    <p>      Affluence (my definition) is contempt for old, but still      usable items . . . and anything can turn up in the refuse      you handle. I once found a beautiful antique wooden trunk      with leather straps, brass reinforcing and still-visible      manufacturer's sticker and trade mark that dated the chest      from 1894. My lady and I have equipped our kitchen from the      treasure hunts we've conducted through other people's      discarded memories . . . our floors have been snugly      carpeted the same way and I even have an old stuffed sea      turtle that one of my customers threw, out!    </p>    <p>      We also sort out and save good, substantial throwaways for      which we have no immediate personal use. Such items are      salable at local auctions, flea markets and swap meets.      Reusable stoves, refrigerators and furniture are given to      the Salvation Army, we recycle anything recycle-able and      sell cardboard, newsprint and scrap metal to local salvage      yards. Soda bottles, or course, can be redeemed at grocery      stores and some beer distributors will now pay you for both      their aluminum cans and glass bottles. This may seem like      an infinitesimal ecological effort on our cart but if      everyone did just this much to recycle and reuse the "junk"      right around then, our environment would certainly be much      more pleasant . . . and the earth's resources would go a      great deal further.    </p>    <p>      You'll want to rent a hand truck when you move washers,      dryers and other large, heavy items. You'll also need to      hire help and help means expense . . . but, then again,      it's nice to be able to offer jobs to a deserving friend or      friends from time to time.    </p>    <p>      Your only other expenses will be for gasoline, oil and      repairs to your truck (I perform my own labor to save      money), the phone bill (Ma Bell is harsh, but students      don't have to pay a deposit in this area) and a nominal      amount for advertising. If you use a privately owned dump,      as gyre do, you'll have to cough up fees for the privilege.      Don't let this talk of cash flow out discourage you though      . . . you'll make plenty to cover the expenses.    </p>    <p>      I rather like the freedom and independence my hauling      business has given me. It's shown me that life in tire city      doesn't really have to be so tenacious. It's also been our      bridge to other things.    </p>    <p>      Right now I've stopped working for a while to attend school      on the GI Bill while Christina and I live in a beautiful      canyon in the Sierras underneath unfiltered sunlight and      surrounded by nature. Our hone is a tips made from the      plans in MOTHER NO. 1.    </p>    <p>      I still haul . . . but only an occasional cord of wood.      When money is necessary, I always have the means of'      earning it . . . Ganesh and I just pick up the dollars that      are lying around in people's back yards.    </p>
