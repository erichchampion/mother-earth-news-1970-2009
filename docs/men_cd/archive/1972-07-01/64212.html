                      <p><strong>photos by: Cass Wester</strong></p>              <p>    Les Walker and Robert Mangurian-both professors of    design at City College in New York-got so dadgummed    frustrated trying to teach architecture students with paper    models instead of genuine full-scale constructions . . . that    they decided to do something about it. That "something"    turned out to be Whiz Bang Quick City, an instant town of    mostly cardboard domes and polyethylene inflatables erected    for four days near Woodstock, New York in April of 1971. The    freewheeling project worked so well that Les and Rob (and a    vastly expanded merry band) were back again this year from    May 26 to June.4 with Whiz Bang Quick City 2.</p><p>Now WBQC 2 was    not your ordinary small town. Lord knows. It was more like    The Swiss Family Robinson Meets The Illegitimate Children Of    Jules Verne. You know, all self-sufficient and do-it-yourself    . . . but in a way that it's never been done before. Or to    put it in other words: the folks who inhabited WBQC 2 were    all good people and true . . . but just delightfully daft    enough to turn a dead-serious design conference into a    nineday frolic.</p><p>But then, what can you expect? Living for    over a week in an instant village of 20 or 30 geodesic domes,    inflatables, stretched fabric forms, foamed dwellings, a    traditional Plains Indian tipi, bamboo towers and parachute    tents is heady stuff, fells. Especially when your own media    freaks are circulating with TV monitors, video tapes and    Radio WBQC-AM-brought in all the way from    <em>Yonkers</em> especially for the occasion-to    document the whole happening. It's a wonder the local    constabulary didn't surround the entire event, cart off the    complete cavorting crowd-dogs and all-and lock    'em up for loonies.</p><p>Well, not really. Because, as any fool    could plainly see, this mini-Woodstock Nation was clearly a    portent of the Abundant Life For All that Bucky Fuller and    other seers keep telling us is just around the corner. And    the atmosphere, the <em>incredible</em> atmosphere of sharing    and cooperation! Who could possibly gaze out over the mellow    men and maids camped on WBQC's three amazing meadows . . .    and not catch at least a <em>glimpse</em> of Better Times    ahead?</p>        <p>    That glimpse was brought to Planet Earth this year by Les    and Rob and a few helpers. The American Federation of the    Arts, Educational Facilities Laboratory, New York State    Council on the Arts and CCNY-to be    specific-kicked in grant money amounting to a total of    $3,500. Anon Shoener had a lot to do with those grants . . .    and other funds set aside to partially finance WBQC for some    years to come.<br />    And let's hear it for Walter Urban and Mike Ernest who leased    WBQC's site-the whole shebang, including three meadows    and a pond-to Les and Rob for the magnificent sum of    $1.00 (worth roughly 37 cents in these inflated times).</p><p>Not    forgetting for the nonce, of course, that the powers-that-be    in nearby Phoenicia, New York passed a special ordinance to    make the gathering all very legal and official. A right    neighborly gesture, we'd say, and one that should be noted    far and wide.</p><p>Now at this point-unfortunately-our    communications-regrettably-begin to-we hate    this-break down. We <em>know</em> that many other    energetic individuals helped to make WBQC 2 the satisfying    and sparkling success it was . . . but, thanks to the warm    and informal "either a first <em>or</em> a last name but    seldom both" basis of the event . . . well, we just ain't    gonna be able to give complete credit where credit is due.    Credit to folks like Pedro, who was responsible for parties    and the bridges that connected the meadows . . . and    Davidson, who oversaw the parking of vehicles . . . and the    steering committee (known collectively only as the "Garbage    Board") . . . and a lot of others.</p><p>As a matter of deplorable    fact, we're still so high from WBQC 2 that we can't even    remember a fraction of the participants. We can recall a few,    though, and-since <em>something</em> is better than    nothing at all-well . . .</p><p>The School of Visual Arts in    New York City set up one of the finest looking free-form    fabric structures we've yet seen . . . of 100% stretched    nylon donated by DuPont. As luck would have it, the expensive    material was browned and weakened by a campfire during the    week, but it still hung gracefully attached to two large    trees until the day WBQC 2 folded.</p><p>ZOME also experienced a    Little Bad Luck There when that group's cardboard building    collapsed in the rain shortly after it was constructed . . .    but (ahem) we won't even mention that.</p><p>W.R. Wendell-the    chief navigator of DOME EAST-brought 12 fellow domers    to WBQC 2, a 30-foot shelter and networks of information to    share with one and sundry. The DOME EAST people even kind of    sort of hinted that they'd be back next year with a bubble    building big enough to cover a tennis court.</p>             <p>And didja see the colorful fabric tend that the Syracuse    School of Architecture and some other folks from that    university's community erected for use as a    30-people-at-one-time WBQC 2 community kitchen? It was right    next to the 18-foot high, 1,200-square-foot air structure    that the same group (they called themselves "Membrane")    inflated.</p><p>The blow-up building cost the Syracuse group $1,500    for materials and took two weeks to weld together with    electric equipment. Once the parts were unloaded at Quick    City, though, the Syracuse students unrolled, zipped together    and raised the bubble structure in a matter of hours.</p><p>    Membrane's big air house was stabilized by a tension net    reinforced with ropes and pinned to the ground with screw    anchors . . . while an electrically powered blower fed 4,500    cubic feet of air per minute into the bubble to keep it    inflated. (The Syracuse people freely admit that an air    structure's constant power requirement is a major    disadvantage that remains to be remedied.)</p><p>At any rate,    Membrane's bubble building did a fine job of housing the    Syracuse contingent during the night and made an ideal    evening theater for video tape playbacks and light shows.</p><p>Up    in the second meadow, one of the stars of the Quick City show    was the "rotating hyperbolic parabola" tower put together by    20 or more unidentified university students from lengths of    bamboo ("well, we had all this bamboo lying around, and. . .    "). The 30-foot-high, graceful, hourglass-shaped edifice    swayed proudly to its commanding height on Saturday afternoon    and-surprisingly, to some bystanders-proved    substantial enough to provide a vantage point from which a    few daring souls smiled down on WBQC 2.</p><p>And leave us not    forget the patented vacation house that four young New York    Tech designers brought in via VW bus. The total $220 they    spent for quarter-inch untempered masonite, six $9 marine    canvas hammocks (from Sears), a rope ladder, four 4 x 4's and    miscellaneous hardware and accessories looked like a very    good investment indeed.</p><p>The Gellert Family (owners of Sunbird    Kites) probably used Quick City to greatest advantage by    <em>selling</em> their newest design (did someone say for    $20,000?) right in the big middle of the event. The    attractive 37 x 23-foot house-with a soaring roof    inspired by one of their kite designs-took five men one    long day (10 hours) to assemble. Estimated costs of the shell    alone was $1,000 . . . although this particular model was    outfitted with <em>everything.</em></p>                    <p>      The real Queen Of The Show, in many folks' eyes, though,      was the plastic palace inflated by three Cornell University      graduates calling themselves Clear Wheely Productions. The      huge, 50-foot-diameter, 12-foot-high, donut-shaped air      structure of 12 mil polyvinyl fluoride film was anchored at      all four "corners" by a membrane pegged to the ground. Two      half-horse blowers pumped air into the bubble through big      tubes and a double-door, airlock entrance kept it there.      The light shows featured nightly in the building could be      seen inside, from the tubes and by folks strolling past.</p><p>      Clear Wheely's inflatable was glue-seamed together in two      to three weeks and erected on Quick City's grounds by eight      people in six hours. It's designers say they'll demonstrate      the structure anywhere in the country.</p><p>Then again, WBQC 2      was more than just designs and structures. It was      individuals and communes and workshop seminars and Pete      Seeger and a Memorial Day parade of 700 radiant souls with      a 270-member kazoo band. It was film makers, farmers, video      freaks and a group known as the Better Days Prospectors      whose Big Number featured a goggled and parachuted member      of their troup soaring (?) off Snoopy's doghouse on      gossamer (well, OK . . . plastic and cardboard) wings. It      was Good Times!    </p>
