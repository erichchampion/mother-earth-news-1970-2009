            		     <h5 id="byline">by MIKE KIERNAN</h5>     <h3>THE YAWNING OF AMERICA</h3><p>	    The greening of America - for a lot of people -      began in 1970 with the first Earth Day. A new awareness      took root together with a new commitment to preserve      America's environment. But two years later one finds a      prospective garden of delights filled with political      bramblebrush.    </p>    <p>      Something has happened . . . in the important, necessary      process of moving from the streets to the courts and to      endless Congressional subcommittee hearings, the      environmental movement has sputtered to a slow drum roll.    </p>    <p>      There are exceptions, of course. In West Virginia, for      example, strip mining became the number one issue in the      recent Democratic primaries. In one race after another,      locally and state-wide, citizens issued a mandate against      the coal-producing industry and the United Mine Workers.      Among the victors were two important environmental      advocates - Congressman Ken Heckler and gubernatorial      candidate John D. Rockefeller.    </p>    <p>      But what happened in West Virginia last May is not likely      to happen nationally this fall. While activists in      Washington continue valiantly to maintain that preserving      the environment can be a potent national issue in November,      one senses across the country a long, tiresome yawn.<br />    </p>    <p>      Such indifference will become apparent in the race for the      presidency. Never before has a national debate on the state      of the environment appeared so necessary. A whole range of      issues demand discussion . . . from automobile pollution to      phosphate detergents. The Energy Crisis alone could      generate enough topics for weekly debates among the      candidates from now until November . . . what are we going      to do about that pipeline in Alaska or that experimental      atomic breeder reactor down south or oil shale out west or      that gigantic hot-air plant at Four Corners, New Mexico?    </p>    <p>      But on these questions and others one can expect little but      lip service from the candidates.    </p>    <p>      Why? "It's Nixon," one political analyst told MOTHER, "He's      made the question of preserving the environment boring for      the voters and suicidal for the Democrats. Look at Muskie.      He went to Ohio and talked about saving Lake Erie. He went      to Florida and talked about saving Big Cypress. And he got      nowhere, The people don't seem that interested. The real      issue this year is jobs, then truth in government, then      welfare, then the war . . , the environment is way back on      this list."    </p>    <p>      I talked to a dozen other political forecasters in and      outside the environmental movement who echoed the same      opinion, "On the national level Nixon has handled the      environmental issue brilliantly," said one. "He has done      just enough to convince the average voter that we are now      backing away from the brink of ecological disaster . . .      and he has done just enough to avoid a serious challenge      from either McGovern or Humphrey - neither of whom      have the credentials as environmentalists."    </p>    <p>      Political profiles on McGovern and Humphrey -      prepared recently by the highly reputable League of      Conservation Voters - help confirm suspicions that      neither candidate, if nominated, would make preserving the      environment a major campaign issue. (Complete sets of seven      studies including Richard Nixon's profile are available for      $3.00 at the League of Conservation Voters, 324 C St. SE,      Washington, D.C. 20003)    </p>    <p>      Reviewing LCV's findings, it appears George McGovern would      be the stronger of the two Democratic candidates on      environmental issues . . . but perhaps not by much.      McGovern is a member of the Senate Interior Committee and      the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry---both      important ecology committees - but, according to LCV,      "he has not used these positions to, work actively on      conservation and environmental issues, He can be counted to      take the right positions on vir tually every environmental      issue, but he often misses committee hearings, and most      conservationists feel he could do more than he has."    </p>    <p>      Since announcing his candidacy for president, McGovern, in      fact, has spent little time working on any issues in      Washington. One staffer recently admitted that McGovern has      not spent a full week in the nation's capitol since last      October. To his credit, however, McGovern has been      typically candid about his shortcomings in the      environmental area. "I want to plead guilty as a candidate      for the presidency for not having done enough (on      environmental issues.) I'll try to do better in the      future."    </p>    <h3>THE HAPPY WARRIOR</h3>    <p>      Humphrey is strictly a "middle of the roader" on ecological      matters. According to LCV, "His long public career is a      mixture of early courage and recent ambivalence in, regard      to environmental issues." Luring his recent campaigning      Humphrey has favored abolishing strip mining in West      Virginia and saving the Big Cypress swamp in Florida, "but      when short term labor interests conflict, Humphrey's      commitment to hard environmental solutions weakens."    </p>    <p>      Only Edmund Muskie-the Mr. Clean in the      Senate-has expressed the interest and established the      record to challenge Nixon's environmental policies. Author      of all the major air and water pollution amendments over      the last decade, Muskie "has had more influence over      national pollution control policies than any other man in      Congress," reports LCV. But, after his debacle in the early      primaries this spring, Muskie is an unlikely choice at the      coming Democratic convention.    </p>    <p>      As for the Republicans, President Nixon has chartered his      course carefully on environmental affairs. He has been able      to go both ways on just about every issue-appearing      tough before the public and accommodating before industry      and other monied interests. The duality is reflected in his      Cabinet. When one Nixon official urges Congress to get      tough, another invariably arises to speak up on the merits      of going slow. Each appears to express the sentiments of      the President . . . to the extent that no one knows for      sure where the President's real sentiments lie. Again with      the help of LCV's lengthy report, here s a cursory review      of Nixon's mixed record.    </p>    <p>      First, the good nevus. Nixon has created the Environmental      Protection Agency and given it the funds to do its job. In      19?2 EPA received $1.3 billion or almost twice as much as      its 1971 budget . . . Nixon has established the highly      visible three-man panel, the Council on Environmental      Quality, and he has actively sought its advice . . . Nixon      has halted the Everglades jetport project and vetoed plans      to build the cross-Florida canal . . . and Nixon has      sought to divert money from the Highway Trust Fund to      support urban mass transit.    </p>    <p>      Then, there's the bad news . . , including such bobbles as      Nixon's active support of the SST, the Alaskan pipeline,      the. nuclear test on Amchitka island and phosphate      <em>detergents. . .</em> Nixon lobbied hard in Congress      against Muskie's tough air and water amendments and      recently he has sought to weaker the National Environmental      Policy Act oil, drilling off the shores of California and      he appears like side with Detroit if a real showdown      develops over an extension the 1975 deadline on automobile      emission standards . . president has also proposed 2,600      atomic breeder reactors for the year 2020, a policy which      LCV calls "the most ill-conceived" the Nixon      administration.    </p>    <p>      So, where does all this Presidential zigzagging on the      environmental <em>went lead</em> us? Probably towards a      presidential campaign in which the various complex issues      are ignored altogether.    </p>    <p>      At this writing it appears that only a major environmental      upheaval-either in the country or in the      administration-could make preserving the environment      a major issue. (I'm thinking of an ITT-like scandal in the      Environmental Protection <em>Agency that</em> reaches deep      into <em>the</em> administration's inner circle or, eve      worse a series of temperature inversions in major cities      around the country like the inicident in Birmingham last      November.)    </p>    <p>      But such events, terrible to contemplate, are also      unlikely.    </p>    <h3>DIRTIER BY THE DOZEN</h3>    <p>      Meanwhile, as nearly 8,000 delegates and their alternates      prepare to descend upon Miami this month and next to choose      the presidential candidates of the two major parties, a      handful of environmental activists are ignoring the      conventions and engaging in a different kind of nominating      process.    </p>    <p>      The group, Environmental Action, has pored over      congressional voting records for the last two months and      selected a Dirty Dozen: twelve Congressmen with      performances so poor, on the environment that they've been      marked publicly for defeat this November 1 by the ecology      movement.    </p>    <p>      The purge list includes: Wayne Aspinal (D-Col.), Walter S.      Baring (D-Nev.), Earle Cabell (D-Texas), Charles E.      Chamberlain (R-Mich), James J. Delaney (D-N.Y.), Sam L.      Devine (R-Ohio), Earl Landgrebe (R-Ind.), Sherman Lloyd      (R-Utah), Peter Peyser (R-N.Y.), John James Rooney      (D-N.Y.), Vernon W. Thomson (R-Wis.) and Roger Zion      (R-Ind.).    </p>    <p>      In 1970 when Environmental Action waged its first Dirty      Dozen campaign, the group steered clear of Congressmen      whose positions in their home Districts appeared      unshakeable. To qualify a Congressman needed more than a      filthy record. He ho to be facing an opponent who would be      a marked improvement and he had to be running in a race      where the publicity against him might make a difference.      The strategy worked. Seven of the 12 Congressmen picked      failed to return to Congress. No quarrelling with success,      Environmental Action is following the same plan of action      this year.<br />    </p>    <p>      Relatively unknown outside their own Districts, the Dirty      have served a total of 166 years on Congress. Of the 12,      however, only two have accumulated enough consecutive yeas      in the House to be considered real powers. The Durable Duo      Wayne Aspinal-chairman of the interior and insular      Affairs 24 years seniority, and John Rooney-chairman      of the Appropriations subcommittee that controls the that      purse strings of the State, Justice and Commerce      Deptartments- with 28 years.    </p>
