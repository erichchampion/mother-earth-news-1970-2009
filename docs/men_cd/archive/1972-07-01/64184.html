                   <h5 id="byline">by HAL SMITH:</h5>         <p>      About a year and a half ago Bruce McDuffie-an upstate      New York chemistry professor - prodded by his wife      and a 17-year-old lab assistant, went to a supermarket,      bought some tuna fish and tested it for mercury      contamination. The rest is, as they say, history. The      resulting tuna scare destroyed the U.S. swordfish industry      and crippled the tuna fishermen (see MOTHER NO. 9).    </p>    <p>      Recently the same chemist went shopping again . . . and      guess what? One fourth of the cans of tuna he found      on-supermarket shelves were as contaminated as those that      caused the public outcry. Meaning: FDA assurances to the      contrary, nothing has been effectively done to end      contamination of tuna.    </p>    <p>      "I'm very surprised," says Prof. McDuffie, an analytical      chemist specializing in environmental research at the State      University of New York at Binghamton. "I don't know how      much testing the FDA has been doing. Have they been leaving      it to the fishing industry?" If further testing confirms      his results, McDuff ie says, the FDA should institute a      program for "close auditing and continuing inspection" of      tuna. He favors a bill now before the Senate which would      require a daily inspection of each of the 2,000 tuna      packing plants in the U.S.    </p>    <p>      While the FDA's ineffectiveness hardly makes news these      days - many observers agree it protects those      industries it supposedly regulates - McDuff ie      continues to grab headlines, chipping away at bureaucratic      sabotage of environmental progress. Recently, for example,      he publicly protested the intrusion of Cold War politics      into the UN's Conference on the Human Environment held this      past June in Stockholm.    </p>    <p>      Because the East Germans have not been invited to      participate in the air pollution conference, Russia and its      East European allies are boycotting the meeting. McDuffie,      calling for a "truly worldwide" conference, has appealed to      American representatives to the conference and to Kurt      Waldheim, the new Secretary General of the UN, to invite      the East Germans. "Otherwise," he says, "how can we expect      to solve pollution problems which transcend national      boundaries?"    </p>    <p>      McDuffie <em>has</em> won one recent battle. Last October,      after a child in New York City died of lead poisoning, and      at the request of an investigative reporter, he tested the      lead content of paint on pencils. McDuffie found up to 18      times the permissible level of lead in some brands of      pencils and, partly as a result of his findings, the State      Attorney General has asked for a permanent injunction      barring the sale of "poison pencils".    </p>    <p>      The chemist's persistence has begun to pay off personally      too. First, no doubt as a result of the tuna-mercury      publicity, McDuffie has landed a $14,400 grant from the      Rockefeller Foundation to inventory the Susquehanna River      for possible contamination by trace metals. Second, he has      gained a little political clout: Prof. Bruce McDuffie has      been chosen as a McGovern delegate tee the Democratic      National Convention.    </p>
