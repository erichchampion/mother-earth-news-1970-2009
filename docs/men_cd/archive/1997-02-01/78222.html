                    <p>      The best method of controlling insects that damage crops is      to keep your garden a secret. Don't invite them to the      party. Think of insects like germs. There are always plenty      of them around, but they don't become a problem until there      is a weakness. Who cares if the sphinx moths fly around      your garden, as long as they don't lay eggs on your tomato      plants that will hatch into tomato hornworms? If we assume      they are only going to lay eggs on weak plants, we can be      assured they will leave alone our happy and healthy plants      growing in humus rich soil. It is clearly better to avoid      an insect problem than to have to deal with it. A nutrient      balanced soil is the best way to get insects to avoid your      garden.</p>    <h3>Barriers</h3>    <p>      Another way to keep insects from getting to your plants is      to create a barrier they cannot surmount. You need to know      a little bit about the insect to erect the most effective      barrier. Someone might have the image of a garden enclosed      in mosquito netting. That might work but it is not very      cost-effective. I say might, because there are a lot of      different insects and if their motivation is strong enough,      they are likely to find a way in. Netting can be a      cost-effective barrier in some circumstances. Root maggots      are the larval form of a fly that lays eggs on the stems of      young plants. The flies may lay eggs on more mature plants,      but if they do the plants are growing fast enough to      survive. Young plants can be protected by a netting barrier      laid right over the seedling or even over the seed bed      before the seedlings emerge. A square foot of netting will      protect a hill of cucumbers. Clearly there is not much work      or material involved in this and the hill will produce a      lot of cucumbers if helped through the tender stage.    </p>    <p>      Unhappy radishes will also attract root maggots. Since you      would have to cover the whole row with netting to protect      them, and considering that radishes reach maturity in a      little over three weeks, a barrier hardly seems worth the      effort. Radishes also attract flea beetles-usually      radishes planted too early in the spring in my garden.      While the radishes are shivering in the cold, growing      slowly while they wait for the air and ground to warm up a      bit more, the flea beetles are feasting, sometimes setting      the plants back so severely I lose the crop. No problem: I      just throw in some more seeds. Flea beetles will do the      same number on broccoli directly seeded in the garden.      Since I am going to transplant this crop later, the      seedlings can all be grown in a foot-long row which can be      covered easily. When the plants are four or five inches      tall and ready for transplanting, there is enough when they      cut down the leaf surface of transplants. After all, we      prune larger plants when we transplant them so the damage      to the roots is balanced with a decrease in the above      ground portion of the plant.    </p>    <p>      While on transplants, we must not forget the insect most      often combated with barriers: the cutworm. Cutworms also      get around on wing but generally the grub is already in the      ground when we have to deal with it. A collar of tar paper,      cardboard, or some similar material that can be formed into      a circle about three inches in diameter and a couple of      inches tall and pushed into the soil an inch to make a wall      around each transplant.    </p>    <p>      Diatomaceous earth can also be used as a barrier. This is a      powder made up of calcified one-celled plants. To      soft-bodied insects it is a sea of razor-sharp edges. What      insects crawl on the surface of the ground to reach plants?      None, actually, but slugs do. Slugs are mollusks, not      insects, but gardeners can find little reason to make this      distinction. A band of diatomaceous earth around the      cabbage and/or lettuce if these are the crops being      plagued, or around the whole garden, will keep slugs at bay      if they are coming "from away" as we say in Maine. The      diatomaceous earth cuts the bodies of slugs and soft-bodied      insects that come in contact with it.    </p>    <h3>Traps</h3>    <p>      Slugs suit my purpose as an example of how traps can be      used. They do most of their work at night when it is damp      and cool. On a hot day, they can be found in cool, moist      places. If you put some boards down in the garden, you may      find lots of slugs under them in the heat of day. They also      are attracted to malt. Dishes of beer will attract them      ...and they'll drown happily.    </p>    <p>      Electric insect zappers will attract night-flying moths      which lay eggs that turn into hungry worms. A light placed      in juxtaposition to a sticky surface is a good combination      for attracting and killing night-flying insects. It is      preferable to the zapper because you can see the insects      you are trapping and identify them. You will likely find      that the majority are, at worst, benign.    </p>    <p>      Yellow cards covered with sticky stuff attract many      insects. Sticky red balls hung in apple trees get covered      with insects landing on them, also. These can be used as      traps to decrease populations but they are more often used      to monitor the number of insects present at any given      time.</p>    <h3>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h3>    <p>      IPM uses the sticky traps just described to time the      spraying of pesticides. IPM is a giant step forward for      commercial growers who used to spray large quantities of      contact poisons as a matter of routine. If you were selling      stuff for farmers to spray on their crops, wouldn't you      want them to spray lots and spray often? Most, if not all,      good farmers use IPM methods now. It has cut the use of      pesticides in this country dramatically. If you are a gar      dener and you are spraying a contact poison like Sevin at      the first sign of an insect, you are the last of a dying      breed. Think about it.    </p>    <h3>Timing</h3>    <p>      Some people have reported success in avoiding insects by      timing plantings so insects are avoided. For example, corn      earworms generally do not survive winter much north of New      Jersey. If you can figure out when they hatch and how long      it is likely to take them to get out of your garden, you      can time your planting so the ears form after the first      flight and before the second. This won't always work      because of variations in winter weather. However, if you      have several plantings of corn and some have big problems      and other don't, make a note of it. While you may not want      to cut out any of the succession crops, you may decide one      planting will be better for the bulk of the storage crop      than another.    </p>    <p>      Timing can also be helpful in disrupting an insect's life      cycle. Tilling the garden in the fall, for example, puts      the cutworm larva up on the surface where birds can find      them. I wouldn't recommend this unless I had a major insect      problem that couldn't be reasonably dealt with in any other      way. The disruption in the problem insect's life cycle is      likely to be a disruption to a lot more friendly and benign      insects as well.</p>    <h3>Sprays</h3>    <p>      There are only two sprays that I will use: Bacillus      thuringiensis (Bt) and Bacillus thuringiensis var. san      diego-the former for cabbage loopers, cabbage worms,      and tomato hornworms; and the latter for the Colorado      potato beetle. I use them because they are non-toxic and      because they only kill the target insects, and even then      only if they eat a leaf that has BT on it.    </p>    <h3>Predator Insects</h3>    <p>      The two most famous of these are ladybugs and praying      mantis. Several kinds of wasps and lacewings are also      helpful. You can buy some of these beneficial insects for      release in your garden. I won't go into the gruesome      details of how many aphids a hungry ladybug can eat in an      hour. Consider what that hungry bug is going to do when the      food runs out. "Fly away, fly away" to someplace where the      food supply is better. I have got some of all of these      insects in my garden or close by, I think, though I don't      see them often. I'm glad not to, since that means there      isn't much for them to eat.    </p>    <p>      If I come across a tomato hornworm carrying a load of white      oval packages on its back, I leave it alone. The packages      are eggs of a parasitic wasp. I want them to hatch so there      will be more wasps around to seek out hornworms. The wasps      are much better at finding them than I am.</p>    <h3>Companion Planting</h3>    <p>      I have been planting rows of beans next to rows of potatoes      for over 20 years, because I read somewhere that the beans      would discourage Colorado beetles and potatoes would      discourage Mexican bean beetles. I am seldom bothered with      Mexican bean beetles, but if the beans have had an effect      on the potato beetles it has been very inconsistent. It      says in Organic Plant Protection, by the editors of Organic      <em>Gardening and Farming</em> magazine (Rodale Press,      Inc., Emmaus, PA, 18049) that nasturtiums will repel      aphids. In my experience I would be more likely to believe      that nasturtiums are a catch plant for aphids.    </p>    <p>      It seems to me that companion planting is a nice idea but      that the information available may be more anecdotal than      scientific. Tansy is suppose to repel lots of insects, but      who wants bales of tansy in the fall even if it would be      great on the compost pile?<br />    </p>    <p>      Back to Low-Maintenance Pest Control...
