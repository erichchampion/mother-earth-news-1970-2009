                <p>      <strong>ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT</strong>    </p>    		    <p>      <strong>Replacing an aging engine with an electric model      will save time, money, energy, and headaches.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Tom Moates    </h5>    <p>      <em>While there are several types of vehicle conversions      possible - such as Dave Arthur's hybrid electric car      (see MOTHER'S June/July '93 issue); or using propane or      even wood-produced steam to replace your existing      combustion engine with a clean-burning, reliable powerplant      - converting to an entirely electric vehicle has      become a very reliable and cost-effective means of      transportation for the commuter. In fact, many city      governments have electric vehicles in their fleets and      electric forklifts have been in the workforce for well over      a decade.</em>    </p>        <p>      Brian Walsh is an alternative energy expert and has      recently converted a Chevy S-10 pick-up as a pilot vehicle      for his company Moonlight Solar, Inc. This truck has been      on the road now for a year, running without a problem and,      according to Walsh, that's the point ...while electric      vehicle conversions have certain components that are      costly, once converted, the vehicle is not only quiet and      non-polluting but has no real maintenance except for normal      brake replacement, occasional battery water level checks,      and brush changes in the electric motor every 80,000 miles      (which costs a whopping $80). That's right, there's no      longer an engine, carburetor, catalytic converter, exhaust      system, radiator, starter, hose, or belt. This means that      there's no oil to change and no anti-freeze needed, also      reducing the need for fluids toxic to the environment.    </p>    <p>      The conversion process explained in detail here is based on      the Moonlight Solar truck conversion. Notice that none of      the cargo space in the truck has been compromised, unlike      Dave Arthur's truck where batteries, a generator, and an      engine all are piled in the bed. Walsh's truck has      batteries tucked away nicely in boxes under the bed and      hood and there are no extra internal combustion engines or      generators to install as with hybrid vehicles.    </p>    <p>      Converting a vehicle completely to electric in this manner      means removing the internal combustion engine altogether      and installing an electric motor, the components necessary      to operate the motor, and batteries. An EV (electric      vehicle) of this type must be charged for several hours and      then enjoys a traveling radius from 50 to 150 miles      (depending on factors such as weight, number of batteries,      and type of batteries), making it only suitable for      commuter travel. In the near future, however, a new type of      battery called a zinc-air battery should be available which      is reputed to double the range of an electric vehicle for      the same weight. These batteries are already in use in      vehicles in Germany (see "Bits & Pieces" in MOTHER's      Feb/Mar '96 issue).    </p>        <p>      While the range threshold makes an EV most suitable for      commuter travel, this should not be confused with lack of      power. Riding in the Moonlight Solar truck, one is struck      by how much power it has; it can literally leap from a      stop. Walsh explains, "We converted a truck to show people      that electric vehicles aren't just one-Beaters with bicycle      tires." And seeing him buzz through town loaded down with      building materials or electrical supplies is testimony to      the success of this venture.    </p>    <p>      The costs for running an EV converted in this way is      amazingly low. For instance, with gas prices now running      about $1.20/gallon, the average vehicle would require about      $4.80 in fuel cost to go 100 miles. The average EV charged      at the current average grid power rate would cost 75  cents      for that same 100 mile trip. But Walsh maintains that the      true savings come from the lack of maintenance; after all,      virtually every part particular to internal combustion      motors are no longer part of the vehicle and there is very      little to go wrong with the conversion components.    </p>    <h3>Finding the Components</h3>        <p>      The reasonably seasoned, generally skilled do-it-yourselfer      can tackle an EV conversion, but there are certain      components that must be purchased and these should not be      skimped on. Some of these may be available in surplus      catalogs or used from some industrial suppliers but finding      them will take a bit of scrounging and they all are      available new from EV, forklift, or industrial supply      companies.    </p>    <p>      First is the propulsion motor. You will need either a DC      motor or an AC motor coupled with an inverter. Most motors      are rated at 120 volts and come either as an eight- or      nine-inch motor - the eight-inch for vehicles up to      2,500 lbs. before conversion and the nine-inch for vehicles      up to 3,000 lbs. Best for the home builder (also the type      used in the truck and stressed in this article) is the DC      series wound motor - it is more efficient than a      brushless type DC, with more power for the weight and it's      infinitely simpler to configure than an AC motor/inverter      system. There are used motors out there, many powering      large industrial equipment, but if you buy a new one expect      to pay $1,200 to $1,400.    </p>         <p>      Next you must find a controller. This piece controls the      activity of the propulsion motor and must match the      characteristics of the motor and be properly sized for the      vehicle you are propelling. When looking for a controller,      make sure the one you get is matched for the voltage of the      battery bank in the vehicle (or larger) and it must have      enough amperage to propel the vehicle from a stop. The      amperage rating must be three to five times normal cruising      amperage to be road worthy - 400 amp for light cars      is acceptable (the Moonlight truck is rated at 500 amps).      The best brand controllers to purchase are Curtis and GE as      they have been around for a long time and are continually      updating the equipment. Expect to pay $800 to $1,300 for a      good controller, remembering always that skimping in this      area <em>will</em> produce a vehicle that is not      roadworthy.    </p>    <p>      Another very specific part is the adapter plate which goes      between the electric motor and the bell      housing/transmission of the vehicle being converted. A      local machinist may be able to build one of these for you,      but it is definitely a job for a professional.      Prefabricated adapter plates are on the market for hundreds      of different vehicles. Moonlight Solar handles these items      as do several other EV conversion companies around the      country.    </p>    <p>      The final specialty component may surprise you - the      battery charger. Realize that the large battery banks of an      EV produce voltages around 120 and chargers that operate at      that high voltage only are found from forklift or EV      dealers. The Moonlight Solar truck is equipped with an      inboard charger allowing Walsh to charge anywhere a regular      electrical socket is handy - he opens the fuel tank      cap and pulls out a cord. At home, however, he "tanks-up"      the truck with a larger charger reducing the time necessary      for a full electrical load, and you may wish to install      this same set-up.    </p>    <p>      The rest of the components are more readily available and      can be found locally or through surplus catalogs and      stores.    </p>        <p>      Batteries come basically in two types, lead acid and nickel      cadmium. Lead acid are the most common, are compact, and      are one-tenth the cost of ni/cads. The only real advantage      to the ni/cads is that they do not lose range in cold      temperatures as lead acid batteries do. Note also that the      batteries here are not normal automotive batteries which      are rated in cranking amps but rather they are deep cycle,      EV, or golf cart batteries and have a "minute" rating. Most      fall between 110 and 145 minutes which is how long their      charge will last at a 70 amp discharge.    </p>    <p>      Battery requirements for an EV are typically figured as      such:    </p>		<p>		<strong>Twelve 6-volt batteries</strong> (72 volt)    ...strictly city use, no high speeds, or...<br />		<strong>Sixteen    6-volt batteries</strong> (96 volt) ...more standard    operation, or...<br />		<strong>Twenty-plus 6-volt    batteries</strong> (120 volt) ...hilly operation or larger    vehicles.		</p>    <p>      Power - Acceleration and ability to climb hills is      related to voltage which corresponds directly to the number      of batteries in the vehicle.    </p>    <p>      Range - This is determined by the overall storage      capacity of the battery bank, not necessarily the number of      batteries.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/160-42-i7.jpg" alt="160-42-i7.jpg" width="273" height="241" />    </div>    <h3>Wiring</h3>    <p>      Good wiring techniques are essential to proper performance      and low maintenance in an EV. Always check wires, screws,      bolts, buss, etc. at each junction at the time of      connection for problems. Wires should be kept short between      components and should have proper ends crimped, soldered,      and then taped or (best of all) shrink wrapped. When      bolting connections together it is always best to shine up      the connections with sandpaper first. Connections can      become corroded causing loss of power or malfunction, so      take the greatest care to prevent this.    </p>    <p>      The schematic shows how the components of the Moonlight      Solar truck are wired, which is similar to any EV,      especially other conversions using the DC series wound      motor. Low and high voltage wire types are given in the      diagram and each corresponding connection must be wired      with the appropriate cable as inadequate wires will heat up      causing current loss or more serious problems. Stick with      copper wire; aluminum is much less preferable and requires      larger sizes for the same load as copper. When running      wires around the vehicle always tie or clamp them neatly      out of the way to con partment walls or frame. It adds to      the showpiece of your handiwork, helps avoid wire damage,      and makes future maintenance and changes much simpler.    </p>		</div>    <p>      Connecting batteries to one another is a very important      part of the overall system. Use 2/0 welding cable with      professionally crimped lugs and "L" type battery terminals      for bolting the cables down rather than the round post      automotive type terminal connectors. This allows for a      tighter connection with a larger surface area. Also      adequate, and probably less expensive than the cable would      be a copper buss (1/8" x 1" strip) or a thick copper tubing      with flattened ends with drilled bolt holes to go between      batteries.    </p>    <p>      Between the batteries and the main contact there must be      either a 250 amp DC rated breaker made by Heiman (which is      the cat's meow of breakers - very easy to click on      and off) or a 300 amp DC rated GE breaker. This breaker      must be accessible to the driver in case it trips while the      vehicle is in operation. Also for safety, 400 amp rectifier      fuses should be placed between batteries - one in      each compartment set. These will never blow unless there is      a <em>major</em> problem, but if there is such a problem      you will be ecstatic to have had that fuse inline. The      truck has three such fuses, one in each battery      compartment.    </p>    <p>      The main contactor is an electromagnetic contactor, a      remote switch, which allows main battery power to go to the      breaker and then the controller. This switch completely      disconnects all power from reaching the motor when the key      is off and for a couple other safety reasons described in      the wiring section later. The main contactor in the truck      is made by Albright.    </p>    <p>      You will also need to scrape up an electric heater. These      are generally pretty efficient and shouldn't be hard to      come by.    </p>    <p>      Battery enclosures must be installed in the vehicle and      must be stout. 1 1/4" angle iron welded with 1/8" plate      bottoms welded to frame or within the body with plywood      sides are good. Angle top strap or some other significantly      structural top to avoid battery tipping or movement over      large bumps is critical. For lead acid operation in colder      climates adding insulation and small heaters which come on      during charging will help range considerably.    </p>    <p>      Beefing up shocks and springs may be necessary, especially      in the end of the vehicle where the weight ratio is not      offset by the removal of the internal combustion engine.      Adding leaves to leaf springs, going from shocks to      spring-over shocks or adding air shocks are all simple      alternativesto this need. Note, however, that if you choose      the air shock route, the vehicle must have enough clearance      to travel even when the air shocks are not pumped up due to      shock damage or malfunction.    </p>    <p>      If your vehicle is equipped with manual brakes, simply keep      them as they are. For power breaks you can either convert      to manual breaks or install a vacuum pump and air chamber      (built from three-inch PVC pipe with capped ends) which      will operate the power breaks.    </p>        <p>      The instrumentation will change. At the very minimum the      vehicle needs an amp and a volt meter which allows the      driver to monitor battery charge and the amount of load on      the motor. Additionally you may install a temperature      gauge, a tachometer, and/or an amp/hour meter.    </p>    <p>      Relays (remote switches) may serve several roles in a      conversion vehicle. Turning on circuits for the controller      or vacuum pump or disconnecting an onboard charger are good      uses for these switches.    </p>    <p>      Also helpful is the inclusion of a standard 12-volt car      battery to run auxiliary equipment like radio, windshield      wipers, and headlights. To charge this battery the      Moonlight Solar truck has two solar panels mounted on the      hood (or roof as indicated by the diagram on WIRING ), but      a DC to DC converter running off the main charger may also      be used.    </p>    <p>      That is a basic walk through the various components. Many      of them can be scrounged, but always keep quality and      condition in the front of your mind when acquiring the      various parts. It can make the difference between happy      motoring and a nightmarish breakdown or poor performance.    </p>    <h3>Finding a Vehicle to Convert</h3>    <p>      Any vehicle can be converted to electric and be outfitted      with just about any extra equipment imaginable, but there      are definite pros and cons to take into consideration if      you want good range and a simple, minimally expensive      conversion.    </p>    <p>      Manual, rack and pinion steering is a big pro. It works      well and puts no extra strain on the battery banks. Power      steering is not a complicated addition (requiring only an      extra vacuum pump and air chamber), but costs considerably      more and reduces the range of the vehicle by 10-15 miles      per charge.    </p>    <p>      Manual transmissions are preferable. They simply remain in      the vehicle as originally installed with no fuss. Automatic      transmissions must have a pump installed to pressurize the      transmission fluid, again reducing range, or the torque      converter must be removed detracting from the smoothness of      the ride. Also note, as explained later, that with an EV,      manual transmissions function like automatics when stopping      and starting anyway.    </p>    <p>      Air conditioning is also possible, but again you're going      to need big bucks and have to endure a significant      reduction in range per charge.    </p>    <p>      Pick-up trucks, like the Moonlight Solar S-10, as it turns      out, make a super easy home conversion. There is adequate      space for components and room enough to work on everything.      Also quite easy are VW Rabbits (probably the all-time      favorite EV conversion), VW bugs for a short range EV (as      battery space is limited), and small cars like the Geo      Metro, which have superb range due to their lightness.    </p>    <p>      Some automobile companies are also offering what are called      "gliders." This is a brand-new regular automobile right off      the assembly without any internal combustion components,      making an EV conversion more practical and affordable than      buying the whole completed thing and dismantling it -      but they are bound to be more expensive than a sound used      vehicle with a blown motor.    </p>           <h3>Converting the Vehicle</h3>    <p>      This is a list of the steps in converting a mainstream gas      guzzler to a quiet, peppy EV They are straightforward, but      much of the job will be the result of how you use your      common sense and finesse to adapt these principles to the      particular vehicle before you.    </p>    <p>      * Weigh front, rear, and total vehicle weight. It sounds      strange but will allow you to asses the weight ratio of the      conversion, allowing it to perform optimally. The local      quarry or dump should have scales and a quick phone call      will let you know a good time to drop by for such a visit.    </p>    <p>      * Mark all wires. If you do this as you disconnect all      parts of the existing vehicle order it can save many      headaches when reassembling the new EV order.    </p>		<p>		Find out which direction the internal combustion engine    rotates by bumping the starter. You will need this so that    the electric motor can be wired to turn the proper direction.<br />    Measure the position of the transmission in relation to the    frame and firewall so that you have a way to judge that it    returns to the same spot when outfitted with the new motor    and adapter plate.<br /> Pull motor.<br /> Do away with:<br /> exhaust system;<br />    gas tank and lines;<br /> radiator, hoses, and all cooling system;<br />    all air pumps and emission system and all extraneous hangers,    brackets, and unnecessary weight.<br /> Clean and paint engine    compartment.<br /> Think about battery placement. In the truck    there are three compartments, one under the hood and two    attached to the frame in the rear under the bed. Using    cardboard mock-ups of correctly sized battery compartments    helps to visualize their placement. Also keep in mind the    size and placement of the electric motor when trying to    figure battery placement under the hood.<br /> Weld in any battery    boxes which do not inhibit installation of electric motor. Do    not compromise the integrity of the frame in any way when    undertaking this step.<br /> Design bolt-in-place battery boxes for    those in the way of motor installation which can be removed    when installing motor.<br /> Install hub to motor.<br /> Attach flywheel    to hub.<br /> Secure motor (still outside of vehicle) and test to    5,000 RPM for balance. If out of balance take flywheel to    machine shop for balancing.<br /> Attach transmission to motor with    adapter which goes between bell housing and the electric    motor and install in a temporary fashion, getting the    transmission back to where it was originally using the    measurements taken earlier.<br /> Fabricate motor mounts which will    hold the electric motor in place and attach to existing motor    mounts.<br /> Install a torsion bar from the motor adapter plate to    frame. Also called a "dog bone," these come in various sizes    and may be purchased at most auto parts stores.<br /> Beef up    suspension (discussed earlier).<br /> Mount the controller in a    good spot which has some airflow to help cool the component.<br />    Find good spots for and mount main contactor, main breaker,    gauges, relays, etc.<br /> Connect accelerator to controller. There    are two basic ways to go about this. Either use the old cable    and connect it so that it pulls on the "pot box," which    should be included with the controller, and configure a    spring to pull the cable back so that it functions like a    normal accelerator pedal; or you can purchase an accelerator    pot box that mounts to the floor, taking the place of the    existing pedal, and then only needs to be wired to the    controller.<br /> Connect low-voltage circuits to light, windshield    wipers, radio, power brake vacuum pump, and any other 12-volt    apparatus you may have.<br /> Wire in any extras you may have.<br /> Run    all main wires.<br /> Install batteries, wiring them tightly and    carefully together, installing one 400 amp rectifier fuse    between the middle two batteries, one per compartment, and    bolting compartment tops properly in place.<br /> Make the final    wire connection a positive battery connection with the    <em>main breake</em> <em>r off.</em></p>        <p>      And that is the basic blueprint for electric vehicle      conversion. You should now be able to flip the main breaker      on, turn the key, put it in gear, gently depress the      accelerator, and ease the newly converted EV into motion.      You will quickly realize that even vehicles equipped with      manual transmissions accelerate from a stop like      automatics, as it is not necessary to depress the clutch      when stopping or starting; unlike the internal combustion      engine, which must always spin when running, the electric      motor only turns when propelling the vehicle. Also, there      is no noise at all from the vehicle when it rests at a      stop, so do not become confused, press the gas, and leap      forward into traffic or a garage door. Walsh found the      Moonlight Solar S-10's operation in foul weather greatly      improved after the conversion, since the battery weight was      distributed throughout the vehicle and not concentrated in      the nose as the internal combustion configuration had it.    </p>    <p>      While an EV conversion requires an investment of time and      money, the result is a fantastic commuter vehicle that      greatly reduces maintenance, fuel cost, and impact on the      environment. Also, the EV is less disposable - expect      to get hundreds of thousands of miles from your components      rather than the normal hundred and fifty thousand of the      internal combustion vehicle. Long distance travel in EVs      also may be closer than you realize, as talk of electric      quick-charging stations along major routes has begun. This      awareness of EVs will certainly continue, and people who      convert vehicles today assert their belief in a more      sustainable mode of travel and pave the way for larger      changes to follow.    </p>    <p>      <em>For more information on EV conversions, contact      Moonlight Solar at 540-381-4971.</em>    </p>
