                <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Making something      out of (well, almost) nothing.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">     By Anne Vassal    </h5>    <p>      I just read a restaurant review in which the food was      mysteriously described as "playful and bold." Whatever      happened to plain "good and cheap"? But when it comes to      grocery shopping, I'm inevitably faced with one of those      good news/bad news situations. The bad news is that food      prices are continually rising while our paychecks are not.      But the good news is that healthy, low-cost meals can still      be found. This doesn't mean that we're confined to a daily      ration of rice 'n' beans. By making thrifty selections      throughout the week, we can splurge on the Saturday-night      salmon. Cost aside, our ultimate goal really is to have      tasty food, and these tips have helped make our meals      healthy, good, and cheap.    </p>		    <h3>Potato-Chorizo Tacos</h3>    <p>      Here's an inexpensive meal to fill up a bunch of teenagers      without going broke. (Save time, too - have them      prepare it.)    </p><p><em>1 teaspoon oil</em><br /><em>4 large white- or red-skinned    potatoes, cut into quarter-inch cubes</em><br /> <em>2 chorizo    sausages* (about a half</em> <em>pound), casings removed</em><br />    <em>1 large onion, diced</em><br /> <em>2 large cloves garlic,    minced</em><br /> <em>1 poblano* pepper, diced (or a small</em>    <em>green pepper if poblanos aren't available)</em><br /> <em>1    small red pepper, diced</em><br /> <em>1/2</em> <em>teaspoon    cumin</em><br /> <em>salt and pepper to taste</em><br /> <em>corn or    flour tortillas</em></p>    <p>      Topping ideas:    </p><p><em>"lite" sour cream or yogurt</em><br /> <em>green    onions</em><br /> <em>tomatoes</em><br /> <em>cilantro</em><br /> <em>grated    Muenster or jack cheese</em><br /> <em>salsa (homemade is    cheaper)</em><br /> <em>avocado (uncheap)</em></p>    <p>      Heat up a large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Add      the oil, then the potatoes. Let them brown, without      stirring for about five minutes. Check to see at they're      crisp, then flip over to brown the other side with the      skillet covered. Watch so they don't burn. When they're      browned and tender, remove from the skillet into a bowl and      set aside. Brown the sausages, breaking up the meat into      small pieces as you stir. Add the onion, garlic, peppers,      and cumin. Sauté until the vegetables are tender,      then taste for seasonings. Serve in a large bowl with small      topping bowls surrounding it. The tortillas can be wrapped      in a dish towel and heated in the microwave or wrapped in      foil and heated in a 350° F. oven.    </p>    <p>      *May be purchased at a Mexican grocery.    </p>                                    <h3>Root Vegetable Stew</h3>    <p>      Anything goes with this old standby. If you have some      frozen summer green beans or a piece of cabbage, throw it      in. You could make a meatless stew but then you wouldn't      have the brown gravy.    </p>		<p>		<em>1/2 lb. stew meat, cut into half-inch pieces</em><br />    <em>2 tablespoons flour</em><br /> <em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em><br />    <em>freshly ground pepper</em> <br /><em>3 large cloves garlic,    minced</em><br /> <em>4 cups water</em><br /> <em>3/4 cup dried navy    beans (or other small beans such as azuki)</em><br /> <em>2 medium    turnips, quartered and sliced into half-inch pieces</em><br />    <em>3 medium rutabagas, quartered and cut into half-inch    pieces</em><br /> <em>4 medium carrots, cut into half-inch    circles</em><br /> <em>3 small onions, peeled and quartered</em><br />    <em>1 teaspoon dried basil</em><br /> <em>1/2 teaspoon dried    thyme</em><br /> <em>1/4 cup red wine</em><br /> <em>1/4 cup tomato    paste</em><br /> <em>1/2 teaspoon salt</em> <br /><em>1/4 teaspoon    cayenne pepper</em><br /><em>chopped parsley (optional)</em>		</p>    <p>      In a plastic bag, shake the meat and flour. Place a large      soup pot on mediumhigh heat, then add the oil. Add the meat      and cook for a minute or so without stirring until browned,      then stir. Add the pepper and let brown again, lowering the      heat if it starts to burn. (It's okay if the meat sticks a      little.) When the meat has browned, add the garlic for      about 30 seconds. Pour in the water and the beans. After      the water heats up, reduce heat to medium, cover, and      simmer for one hour. Meanwhile, scrub and peel the      vegetables if necessary. If you're making mashed potatoes,      start cooking them at this time. When the hour is over, add      the vegetables and herbs. Cover and simmer for another hour      or so until the vegetables are tender but not mushy. Add      the wine, paste, salt, and cayenne. Heat a few minutes,      adding more water if necessary. Serve over mashed potatoes      or noodles and top with parsley.    </p>    <h3>Leek Mashed Potatoes</h3>    <p>      If you hate to peel, use thin-skinned white or red      potatoes. The skins can be mashed also but they'll give the      mashed potatoes a chunky texture. If you don't have a      potato masher, invest a few dollars. It's the only way to      mash 'em. If you can't find this outdated utensil, try a      dime or hardware store in a small town.    </p>		<p>		<em>6-8 large brown russet potatoes, peeled</em><br /> <em>1    tablespoon butter or oil</em><br /> <em>2 small leeks</em><br /> <em>2    large cloves garlic, minced</em><br /> <em>salt, pepper, and    cayenne to taste</em></p>    <p>      Put one inch of water in a covered pot. Cut the potatoes      into one-inch circles and place in the pot. Cover and      simmer for about 45 minutes until tender. If the stew isn't      ready, the potatoes can rest in the covered pot for up to      an hour before they'll have to be reheated. In a skillet,      sauté the leeks in the butter until soft (about two      minutes). Stir in the garlic for about half a minute. Drain      the potato water and save. Using a potato masher, mash the      potatoes until they're no longer in clumps. Add the leek      mixture and a little potato water at a time until you have      the desired consistency. (You could also use heated skim or      low-fat milk.) Mash in the seasonings and serve.    </p>        <h3>      Northern Bean Soup    </h3>    <p>      A great soup for a crowd on a cold wintery day.    </p>    <p>      <em>3 cups uncooked northern beans</em><br /> <em>8 cups      water</em><br /> <em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em><br /> <em>1 large      onion, chopped</em><br /> <em>2 large cloves garlic, minced</em><br />      <em>3 medium carrots</em><br /> <em>3 stalks celery</em><br /> <em>1      teaspoon dried thyme</em><br /> <em>1/2 teaspoon oregano</em><br />      <em>1 teaspoon tamari soy sauce</em><br /> <em>1 tablespoon white      wine vinegar (or cider vinegar)</em><br /> <em>1 tablespoon brown      sugar</em><br /> <em>1/3 cup tomato paste</em><br /> <em>1/2 teaspoon      salt</em><br /> <em>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</em> <br /><em>freshly      ground pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      Place the beans in a large soup pot and add water until the      beans are covered with an inch or so extra. Bring the beans      to a boil, cover, and turn off the heat. Let sit for at      least one hour but not longer than four hours. Drain the      bean water and add the eight cups of water. Cover and      simmer the beans for an hour or so until they're tender.      Meanwhile, slice the carrots diagonally into quarter-inch      slices. Do the same with the celery and set aside. Pour the      beans and liquid into a large bowl.    </p>    <p>      Heat the oil in the soup pot on mediumhigh heat and      sauté the onions until soft, then add the garlic.      Sauté for a minute, then pour the beans and liquid      back in the pot. Add all the rest of the ingredients,      cover, and reduce to mediumlow heat. Simmer the soup for      about 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender, stirring      occasionally so it doesn't stick.    </p>    <h3>Pasta Frittata</h3>    <p>      We always seem to have in our refrigerator small amounts of      cooked pasta. I made up this dish one day for lunch so I      could use up the cold pasta (and some leftover cooked      veggies) and now I'm hooked on it. It only serves one      person but you can double the recipe and use a larger      skillet.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 large egg, beaten</em><br /> <em>1 teaspoon unsalted butter      or oil</em><br /> <em>1 large clove garlic, minced a small piece      of hot pepper (optional), seeded and minced</em><br /> <em>1/2      cup chopped vegetables (whatever you have) such as diced      red pepper, chopped fresh spinach, zucchini sliced into      thin circles</em><br /> <em>1 cup cold, cooked pasta such as      linguini</em><br /> <em>2 tablespoons freshly grated Romano or      Parmesan cheese</em><br /> <em>salt and freshly ground      pepper</em><br /> <em>herbs such as chives and basil during      summer months</em>    </p>    <p>      Set the beaten egg by the stove. Heat up a nonstick      eight-inch sauté or omelette pan on medium-high heat      and add the butter or oil. Quickly sauté the garlic      and hot pepper, then add the vegetables, stirring until      tender. (If you're using spinach, add it last since it only      takes seconds to cook.) Remove the vegetables onto a plate      and add a little more oil if the pan is dry. Spread out the      pasta in the pan so it's flat and pour the egg evenly over      the top. Place the vegetables on top of the pasta and then      add the cheese. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.    </p>    <p>      When the bottom is crispy, carefully flip the frittata over      to cook for not more than a minute on the other side. (A      frittata is usually placed under the broiler to cook the      top but I prefer this easier method.) Flip right side up      onto a plate. It tastes great topped with a few slices of      tomato and chopped herbs if you have them.    </p>      <h3>Rice Pudding</h3>			<p><em>1 1/2 cup water</em><br />      <em>3/4 cup raw long-grain white rice (I use basmati white      rice.)</em><br /> <em>1 3/4 cup skim milk</em><br /> <em>3 large egg      yolks</em><br /> <em>1/4 cup sugar</em><br /> <em>1/4 cup maple      syrup</em><br /> <em>2 tablespoons crystallized ginger,*      minced</em><br /> <em>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</em><br /> <em>1/4 teaspoon      mace or nutmeg</em><br /> <em>1/2 cup currants or raisins</em><br />      <em>1 teaspoon cinnamon</em>    </p>    <p>      Place a nine-inch (or eight-inch) square baking pan inside      a larger baking pan to make sure it fits, then remove. Fill      the larger pan half-full with water. Place on the middle      shelf of the oven and preheat the oven to 350° F.    </p>    <p>      In a large saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Stir in the      rice, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for about 12      minutes until the rice is tender. Remove the lid and add      the milk. Continue to simmer while you whisk the eggs and      sugar together in a small bowl until creamy. Whisk the egg      mixture into the rice.    </p>    <p>      Add the rest of the ingredients except the cinnamon. Heat      the pudding just until it gets hot, stirring frequently.      Pour into the nine-inch pan and sprinkle with cinnamon.      Open the oven door and pull out the shelf, carefully      placing the pudding pan inside the larger pan. (An      eight-inch pan will be very full.) Bake for one hour and      check to see if the milk has solidified. If not, return to      oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on a rack and then chill      thoroughly before cutting into squares and serving.    </p>    <p>      *Crystallized ginger can usually be purchased in the Asian      section of the supermarket, an Asian grocery, or a health      food store. It should be soft and chewy, not rock hard.    </p>    <h3>      Cheapest Eats    </h3>    <p>      Some foods are always a deal. While you may not want them      every day, try to include them when you want to cut      corners.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EGGS:</strong> Here's a high-protein meat      substitute that's under a dollar. (Don't worry about the      fat and cholesterol; an egg is much lower in fat than a      burger.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Beans:</strong> Canned or bulk, the nutritious bean      is always economical.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Legumes:</strong> Lentils and split peas can add      protein to any soup or stew.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grains:</strong> Rice, oats, bulgar, etc., are      fibrous and filling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pasta:</strong> This can vary, but a 79 cents      package of linguini can feed three to four people,      depending on the sauce.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tortillas:</strong> Cost much less than a good loaf      of bread.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Produce:</strong> Carrots, celery, cabbage, and      potatoes stay low priced all year long.    </p>
