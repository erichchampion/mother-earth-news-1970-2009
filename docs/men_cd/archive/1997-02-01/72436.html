            		<p>				<strong>LAST LAUGH</strong>		</p>			      			<p>      <strong>Visiting relatives can make<br /> life a joy... or a      living hell.</strong>    </p>          <h5 id="byline">        By Dan Bova      </h5>    <p>      A while back, I found myself deeply connecting on a cosmic      level with songsmith extraordinaire John Denver, a      circumstance that came as something of a surprise to me      since John and I don't generally share the same musical      taste ...at all. It occurred when I picked up my life and      moved to a small town nestled in the heart of the Colorado      Rockies. Since the day I unpacked, I have been experiencing      a daily dose of what Mr. Denver termed simply Rocky      Mountain High.    </p>    <p>      Whether I am driving to work, chopping wood for the stove,      or cooking in the kitchen, I look out on the horizon and      there they are with their majestic snow-covered peaks and      brilliant yellow and orange valleys. They are inescapable.      I'd been told how the mountains can change a man, make him      more spiritual, bring him closer to God. But the thing that      nobody told me about moving to the mountains is that the      second I signed the lease, everyone and everything I have      ever crossed paths with in my life would inevitably show up      at my doorstep looking for an inexpensive (read: free room      and board) weeklong getaway. While it is easy to explain to      most people that you are "unfortunately bogged down with      work" or "going away that weekend" to avoid any extended      stays, there exists a certain breed of visitors that cannot      and will not be deterred: relatives.    </p>    <p>      Don't get me wrong, I love my family, particularly when      they live in another state or even better a different time      zone. They can be a little eccentric at times, to say the      least, and a little less appreciative of Mother Nature's      wonders than I would like. But still they come. Yes, move      to the mountains and they will come.    </p>    <p>      On a recent visit, my grandparents came down with my little      cousin Dennis and my older brother Richie. Things actually      got off to a pretty good start. I had a few friends over      for dinner that night and we all shared a remarkably      pleasant and uneventful dinner together. Afterwards, we sat      by the wood-burning stove in the living room and spent some      time chatting and catching up. Grandma and Gramps changed      into their pajamas and got ready for bed as my friend Ken      showed Dennis a scar he had acquired on his arm during a      run in with a chain saw. Gramps caught sight of the display      and for some reason deep within the crevices of his mind,      he came to the conclusion that a contest to see who had the      nastiest scar was being waged. Without so much as a word,      Gramps walked up to Ken, cleared his throat, and dropped      his pants to the floor to show everyone the scar from his      hernia operation. His pants were joined shortly by      everyone's jaw (including my girlfriend's) as we all      learned that Gramps unfortunately does not wear underwear      under his pajamas.    </p>    <p>      But that's minor. The man's 77 years old, after all. The      thing that drives me nuts is the utter disrespect and      actual active loathing of nature many of my relatives      exhibit, epitomized best by my brother.    </p>    <p>      Early one morning, I got him all suited up in hip boots and      dragged him down to a nearby creek to do a little      fly-fishing. Standing out in the babbling water has always      helped me clear my mind, relax, and reconnect. I figured      this could maybe change his view of things. Unfortunately      Richie did not have the religious experience I was hoping      for. He did call out several times for his creator,      although "God" was usually fol lowed by a colorful      expletive as he wrestled with the rod and reel. After two      hours in the water, I caught a beautiful striped bass.      Richie almost lost his mind when after catching the fish, I      released it back into the creek. "What the @#$& are you      doing you moron! That was dinner!" When I explained that by      releasing the fish I would give another fisherman the      pleasure of catching it, he just looked at me and marched      back to the shore. He kicked off the boots, lit a      cigarette, and actually gave me the finger. "Two freakin'      hours...," he muttered.    </p>    <p>      But I was determined to change his view of nature. On the      day before they left, I took him out on one of the most      awe-inspiring trails the Rockies have to offer. If walking      among the turning leaves of the aspens did not touch      something in him, he simply had no soul.    </p>    <p>      He was pretty quiet along the beautiful yet strenuous hike,      and I was careful not to say too much either. Finally,      after four hours of hard climbing, we reached the overpass,      the peak of our hike. We looked out over the green and      yellow valleys surrounding us. I looked at Richie and he      was completely silent. He had this incredibly thoughtful      look on his face. What could he be thinking? Was he      reflecting on our shared childhood? His face began      contorting. Could it be that this majestic view finally      broke through to him and moved him to tears? What soulful      thoughts were racing through his mind? Richie's face      suddenly twisted violently and he let out an incredibly      loud sneeze. "A %$#@! gnat just flew up my nose!" He      started back down the mountain. "Why do you live here? Lose      a bet or something?"    </p>    <p>      The next day, I put Grandma, Gramps, Richie, and Dennis on      a plane and headed home. Along the way, I pulled over to      take in the view. John Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" still      rang through my head, but all I could visualize was how      soon I could run off to the phone company to get an      unlisted number.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>- Dan Bova</strong></em>    </p>
