        A recently completed ultralight kit ready for the skies, complete with a Rotax 503 engine (top left) mounted on the front of the aircraft. The sailcloth on the wings of this kit has been coated with polyurethane to reduce porousness of the wings and the resulting drag. Cruising speed of the Flightstar is approximately 70 mph. (top right) Airspeed indicator, altitude, and basic engine temperature gauges are all the information an ultralight pilot needs. (PHOTOS: KIT KITTLE)
