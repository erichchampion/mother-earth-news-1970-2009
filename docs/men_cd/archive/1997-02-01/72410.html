            		    <p>      <strong>Bits and Pieces</strong>    </p>    		<p>      <strong>Resources for discovering and using native      plants.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Pam Alt    </h5>    		<p>      What is a true "native" plant? According to <em>Native      Texas Gardens,</em> (Gulf Publishing, 1997) it is one that      has grown in a particular area without having been brought      there by humans and can survive nicely without any help      from us. <em>Native Texas Gardens</em> is the latest in a      series of books by Andy and Sally Wasowski about      landscaping with native plants. The foreword celebrates an      "emerging new land ethic."<br />    </p>    <p>      This ethic emerges from what the Wasowskis see as a new      interest in different design options and a desire to      preserve regional biodiversity. Although their book is      dedicated to showcasing about 100 Texas gardens, it is also      instructional to anyone interested in the principles of      gardening with native plants: conservation of water, soil,      and other resources (including time); reducing pollution      and chemical use; and increasing wildlife habitats. The      large colorful pages list plants by common and scientific      names and profile people who have embraced native plants as      part of their gardens and their lives.    </p>    <p>      <em>Native Texas Gardens</em> also exemplifies a new trend      in plant resources-that is, specialization and      regionalization in order to provide more thorough and      accurate information. In one of her previous books,      <em>Requiem for a Lawnmower</em> (Taylor Publishing, 1992),      Sally Wasowksi presents her belief in the need for region      specific guides. Authors trying to present a broad scope of      information, she says, rarely understand special needs and      conditions. On the other hand, regional authors address the      unique conditions in selected parts of the country. They      are experts who live with the plants they write about and      have tried the methods they describe.</p>    <p>A fine example of what Wasowski is talking about is    Kahanah Farnsworth's newly updated edition of <em>A Taste of    Nature</em> (Sunbelt Publications, 1997). The first edition    of the book, which appeared in 1994, is a guide to 76 edible    plants of the Southwest. The book also includes 12 plants    that are poisonous, and her discus sions emphasize the care    and knowledge that need to accompany any person's decision to    explore the world of native edibles. Farnsworth's favorite    sources are about plants of a specific region (see resources    listed at the end of this article), but she makes an    important point when she says that plants are separated more    distinctively by habitat than by region (e.g., a cold climate    or a mountainous region is far more telling than a    classification like "Arkansas" or "the upper Northwest").    Thus these regional books can help nar row the scope for    beginning edible plant enthusiasts, but they may be    applicable in many similar geographical regions.</p>    <p>      Farnsworth's book also includes recipes that make this      resource particularly relevant to the modern forager since      many doctors and nutritionists now advocate eating many      different kinds of food, particularly organic and whole      foods, in order to maintain optimal physical and mental      health. Edible plants can provide natural alternatives to      drug therapy and offer interesting meals and snacks that      provide vitamins and minerals so often lacking in the      modern diet.    </p>    <p>      Farnsworth, a former teacher and avid hiker, has studied      with several Native American tribes, including the Cahuilla      of Palm Desert and the Miwok with the Yosemite Association.      The use of and reference to Native American legends,      spirituality, and methods is not unique or new to the      educated edible plant enthusiast. Tom Brown, Jr., who began      a 12-book series on survival skills in the 1980s and heads      a tracking/survival school in Asbury, New Jersey, bases      much of his writing on his work with an Apache man named      Stalking Wolf.    </p>    <p>      Brown, who recently released <em>The Way of the Scout</em>      (The Berkley Publishing Group, 1995), is currently working      on another book about tracking and can tell you from      experience how to survive in the wild with nothing more      than a knife and some knowledge of native edible plants.      His <em>Guide to Wild Edible and Medicinal Plants</em>      (Berkeley Books, 1985) introduces a spiritual connection      with the use of the earth and her plants. It is not      region-specific but does include personally verified      information as well as a unique perspective from Brown's      intense treks into the wilderness.    </p>        <p>      Doug Elliott is a forager who wandered North America for      more than 20 years. Elliott, who spent seasons devoted to      fulltime gathering and studying of herbs in northern New      England, at the foot of the White Mountains in New      Hampshire and along the rockbound coast of Maine, later      traversed the Appalachian mountain chain to West Virginia      with a trowel, plant books, and "much neglected sketch      pad." In his book, <em>Wild Roots</em> (Healing Arts Press,      1995), he provides a spectrum of underground root      structures accompanied by illustrations. Spikenard, for      instance, is a plant found in moist woods throughout most      of the temperate regions of North America east of the Rocky      Mountains. He describes the external features of this      plant, the dozens of tiny white-petaled flowers that appear      in mid or late summer, the purplish black berries that can      be identified early in autumn. His detailed drawings of the      underground structures of plants such as spikenard make      identification feasible (a difficult task because the      aboveground parts of these plants die and shrivel away in      the fall). His explanations of these plants include their      uses and any special lore associated with them (in this      pleasantly aromatic plant's case, the autumn-dug roots are      tender and mild-flavored, making it valuable for emergency      food; and its root can be made into an excellent cough      syrup).    </p>        <p>      Harvesting edible plants can be dangerous if you are not      sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable. Using regional,      experiencetested, and part-specific guides can eliminate a      lot of guesswork to assure you are not eating plants that      are poisonous or ones that might be tainted by the      environment in which they grow. Authors such as Wasowski,      Farnsworth, Brown, and Elliott all emphasize the importance      of identifying and avoiding contamination, controlling      disease and insects, monitoring susceptibility to microbial      infection, being aware of naturally occurring carcinogens,      knowing and understanding all foods we eat, and      incorporating practices to ensure its safety and      wholesomeness.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the books examined in this article, other      excellent guides exist. Following are those recommended by      some of the featured authors and source listings of this      article.    </p>    <p>      The most important resource, however, is your own      experience. So, arm yourself with new and old sources of      information, and return to your "roots."    </p>    <h3>Sally Wasowski recommends:</h3>    <p>      For native plants: T <em>he National Wildflower</em>      <em>Research Center's Wildflower Handbook</em>      <em>(Harper</em> Collins, 1996).
