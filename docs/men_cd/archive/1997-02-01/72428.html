                <p>      <strong>GARDEN & YARD</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Refurbish an Oldie-but-Goodie<br /></strong>      <strong>Evaluating, buying, and restoring used power      gardening equipment.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By John Vivian    </h5>        <p>      You say you don't fancy the idea of spending as much for a      new gardening machine as you'd pay for a barn roof or a      good used truck? Well, scout around for a good used garden      tractor, tiller, or shredder. Your selection may be limited      to older models, but you'll save at least half the new      price and may get a real bargain. Even rebuilding the      engine in an older model will work out to be significantly      less expensive than buying new. Here's how to find an older      gem and make it shine again.    </p>        <p>      Unlike rotary mowers, few serious gardening machines have      been criminally neglected or worked to death. Few      single-function gardening machines get more than a few      hours of use per season. Multiple-use models such as garden      tractor/tillers with snowblower, shredder, and mower      attachments can work happily year-round. But hardly any in      non-commercial use will see service more than three or four      times per month-and they are made with big      truck-tough running gear and industrial/commercial engines      designed to go 5,000 hours before needing a rebuild. Small      wonder that 50-year-old lawn tractors are still working      faithfully (for owners who maintain them conscientiously).    </p>    <p>      And don't evaluate the cost of a used power gardening      machine by comparing it with alternative uses for the      cash-or even for a loan. Price out the hours and      hours and hours of sweat-labor it will spare you (and maybe      your heirs) every year for the next half-century.    </p>    <h3>      MOTHER's Choice    </h3>    <p>      Last fall (the best season to get a good price on gardening      equipment), MOTHER went looking for a machine to establish      and maintain our new country gardens. We settled on a      '60s-era Gravely "L" with 12 volt battery electric start, a      big rotary mower/brush-hog, a sickle bar, riding sulky,      dozer-blade for snow or gravel, and extra wheels with snow      chains. Prices for similar packages ranged from $1,500 to      our cost, $350. A like-new rotary plow costs another $150      (we could have dickered it down some), and we are still      looking for a tiller and cultivator frame and spades.    </p>    <h3>      Beauty Is Tin Deep    </h3>    <p>      First impressions of used garden gear can be misleading. A      gardener often fails to realize that Old Faithful isn't      needed any longer till it's been sitting idle for months or      years. So many perfectly good old tillers, tractors, and      shredders have an accumulation of dried mud, dings,      cobwebs, and surface rust that may signify little.    </p>    <p>      Your best indication of usage is tire-condition. New tires      on an old machine are rare. The cleats molded into the      rubber tires of tractors and tillers wear slowly on soil      and sod. If you see low and thin, badly-worn cleats with      rounded edges, cracks, and nicks you know the machine has      worked on pavement or has really been around. Most tires      are worn but still serviceable after 20 years or more.    </p>                                <p>      Don't worry much about paint condition or surface rust on      tractors and tillers. Bright original paint means the      machine has been stored inside and seldom left out in sun      and rain - indication of excellent past treatment and      little use. Desirable, but not essential. How much      full-scale farm equipment have you seen just left in the      fields (with sensitive parts well-greased) ready for uses      year after year? It is tough stuff.    </p>    <p>      Faded paint indicates outside storage, as sun bleaches.      Repaintings suggest multiple owners (typical of older      machines such as MOTHER'S new/old Gravely that has      circulated locally among several owners...for the same      sales price...for decades). Our machine is painted green      over the original orange by someone who just liked the      color. So do we.    </p>    <p>      Rusted tractor shrouds, tiller-tine hoods, gas tanks, and      most other sheet metal parts can be ignored or replaced      easily and cheaply.    </p>    <p>      But surface rust does count on shredder-grinders made with      a steel framework. The bearings that hold the whirling      chopper reels are bolted or welded to the sides of the      frame, which are exposed to acidic plant material that      encourages rust nearly as much as road salt corrodes      automobile tin.    </p>    <p>      Shake the reel hard and be sure it does not move up and      down within the bearings. You can replace bearings, but      must also replace the main shaft ...which means you need to      gut the machine and replace all the moving parts. Might as      well buy a new shredder.    </p>    <p>      The fasteners that hold the bearings in, and/or the metal      around the punch out made for the bearing casing, and/or      bolts can corrode. The flail reel vibrates in use and will      quickly rattle loose in a corroded sheet-metal frame even      if the bearings remain solid. (This is why we are partial      to the old WW II line, with its drop-dead sturdy cast-iron      side-frames.) So, inspect an old shredder carefully for      rust around bearings, bolts that hold the frame together,      and around safety shields and baffles. Lightly rusted nuts      and bolt heads can be gussied up with a wire brush and      paint. But look for rot in the sheet metal they poke      through. Reject any machine with noticeable frame      corrosion.    </p>    <p>      Try to make any self-propelled machine wobble on its      wheels. If it does cant to one side, you may have bad wheel      bearings. Shake tiller assemblies, PTO shafts, and pulley      journals. All should set solidly in their bearings. Pulleys      that wobble or are loose on the shaft may be replaceable,      as the soft metal of the pulley hub wears before the shaft.      But if an axle or drive shaft is at all loose, you may be      asking for major repairs.    </p>    <h3>      Engines    </h3>    <p>      Except for older machines with a proprietary engine ('20s      models, Gravely through the Model "L," rare Franklin      tractors and others that belong in a museum rather than in      your corn patch), engines are purchased from Briggs,      Tecumseh, or another engine maker. The gardening machine      and its engine are made and warranted by separate      manufacturers. And though the engine appears to be the      heart of the equipment, it isn't. Engines are expendable      and interchangeable.    </p>    <p>      It's instructive to examine the prepaid maintenance      agreements and "extended warranties" offered for garden      machines by major retailers. Sears' 1996 agreement for its      shredder grinder lists only four engine repairs: tune up      ($15), replace muffler ($19), replace carburetor ($60)      - each with an hour of labor. The fourth is to      replace the entire engine at a cost of $350 plus an hour      and a half of labor. This is typical of today's labor      market and increasingly modular manufacturing protocols.      Few franchised small-engine shops bother to repair a carb;      indeed, many are "throw-away" designs that are crimped or      riveted (not screwed) together, so they can't be      disassembled for repair. And, if anything goes wrong inside      the engine, labor and new parts cost more than a new      engine, so the bad one is simply replaced.    </p>    <p>      Every town has a few small-engine mechanics who have the      tools, know-how, and time to go into engines, and many are      very good at it. But unless you know such an old pro      personally, you are best advised to follow the times. If an      under 10 hp engine is bad, plan on replacing it. The cost      ranges from $150 and up, and you can do it yourself (see      below). If you know a good small-engine rebuilder, you can      save money by rebuilding the larger power plants. Cost is      usually about half the price of a new engine.    </p>    <p>      To check an engine, ignore a rusted-out muffler and surface      grease or dirt. Mufflers rust more in disuse than hard      service and they are easily and cheaply replaced (soak with      penetrating oil, use hammer and chisel to loosen keeper      ring, and unscrew with a monkey wrench.)    </p>    <p>      First, remove air cleaner housing cover and inspect the      cleaner element. If it is pristine, the owner is      conscientious at maintenance or is trying to impress you. A      light coating of dust on the element and outer surface of      the housing is normal. If element is thick with dust or      housing is packed with dust, grass, and dead moths, the      machine has not been well-treated-no matter how      glossy the outside. Remove the element slowly and      carefully; the entire inside of the housing and carb behind      the inner element gasket should be shiny clean. If it is      even a bit dusty, dirt is getting into the engine and,      acting like sandpaper, is wearing down the moving parts.    </p>    <p>      Pull dipstick and inspect oil on it. Fresh-changed oil can      be a warning sign: Is the owner conscientious or trying to      mask problems? Dark but still clear oil is      preferable-suggesting that the machine has been used, but      not abused. Dark and murky is less good. Black, murky, and      gritty means poor maintenance. If oil smells burned, the      bearings may be going. If no oil shows on the dipstick, the      engine is leaking or using oil. Whatever, the owner is      negligent for not keeping it topped up and the engine may      shortly be toast.    </p>    <p>      Using proper tools, remove the spark plug (best to ask      owners to remove it; if they don't know how, be doubly      alert to problems). The little hook on the end (the      electrode) should look clean and dry - a sort of      gray. If it is thinner on the end than the base, it needs      changing; and any performance problems may be due to an old      plug. If the plug end is black and greasy, the oil is      blowing by piston or valves - a bad sign.    </p>    <p>      The most reliable way I know to evaluate the insides of an      engine (short of tearing it apart) is to start it and get      it warmed up, then look and listen carefully. A loud knock      that may be accompanied by a small shudder (as opposed to a      click or a tick) indicates a major problem (rod/crank      bearing or main bearings going or gone.) Even-spaced,      gentle tick-tick-ticks are normal. Listen for uneven      clicks, especially if, when you slow engine speed, the      engine makes blue smoke or twitches in time with the      off-beat click. This can be a bad valve.    </p>    <p>      Use the throttle to accelerate and decelerate fairly      sharply. If the engine sputters and coughs without making      blue smoke it has a carburetion problem. Black smoke is      unburned fuel (unless you sense a bad valve) - also a      carburetion problem.    </p>    <p>      Don't worry if an engine-especially one of the large,      old single-cylinder models - smokes briefly on      start-up. A puff of black smoke on changing speeds is      usually a fouled spark plug or too-rich carb setting. But      if it puffs blue smoke on change of speed, the rings are      worn, which means the piston and cylinder are also      scratched. Using a thick engine oil may give the engine      added life, but the problem will never cure itself and      eventually the engine will fail.    </p>    <h3>      Fix-Up    </h3>    <p>      Many apparent carburetion problems can be cured by      installing a new spark plug. Remove the old plug with a      proper spark plug socket on your ratchet handle. Take the      old plug to the parts store and have them gap a replacement      plug for you. (The most common small-engine plugs, J-8s and      J-10s, use a .025 gap - the space between electrodes      where the spark that fires the fuel is generated. Gap it      yourself if you have a feeler gauge or plug-gapping tool.)      Put a small coating of oil on the plug threads.    </p>    <p>      Replace plug, running it well into the head with your      fingers...being sure it is threaded in properly. Don't      force it ...keep trying to restart it 'til it threads in      with minimal force. Tighten just snug (not real tight) with      wrench. Replace plug, put a nail in the plug end of the      ignition, hold nail close to top of plug with      plastic-handled pliers. Pull starter rope or engage      electric starter. A thick blue spark should jump from nail      to plug. If there's no spark or a weak one you have a      magneto problem-most probably a bad condenser ...but      getting at it requires removing the flywheel or      disassembling the magneto. Job for a pro (or at least aid      of a repair manual).    </p>    <p>      First, though, replace the plug wire (new part from a      small-engine shop) if you can get it free without major      surgery. Corrosion or water entering through old, cracked      plug wires causes more ignition problems than anything but      fouled plugs. Use sandpaper to brighten up connectors and a      blob of dielectric grease on each terminal to waterproof      them.    </p>    <p>      Most carburetion problems can be fixed by fiddling with the      idle and hi-speed mixture screws on the carburetor. Idle is      the big one low on the engine or under the float bowl;      hi-speed is the little one at the throat of the carb. Set      each so engine runs fastest, but without sounding starved,      at idle and at hi-speed. Idle can be adjusted with a third      screw on the throttle control; set it low, but high enough      that exhaust stays clean (no black smoke when you      accelerate).    </p>    <p>      If that doesn't work, clean the carb. Use an open space and      be sure there is no fire anywhere near. Drain or shut off      fuel. Remove and clean the glass sediment bowl on larger      carbs. Remove both needle-valve/adjusting screws (counting      full turns and partial turns-down to the      quarter-turn) as you back them out. Watch for (and do not      lose) the tiny "O" rings, washers, and springs that come      off with the adjustment screws    </p>    <p>      When removing the idle adjust at the bottom of a metal      bowl, fuel will flow out, which is good; it's likely full      of water and crud. Catch it in a pot and dispose of      properly.    </p>    <p>      Using the little straw that comes with it, blow carburetor      cleaner up into both screw holes. Put a pot under carb to      catch dribbling cleaner and any small parts that blow out      (and watch to see where they come from). Where you see it      bubble out down inside the carb, blow some cleaner back out      Clean carb throat. With pressure air (a non-freon aerosol      "can of air" is cheaper than an air compressor), blow carb      out. Replace screws the number of turns they were      originally, hook up fuel, being sure there are no leaks,      fire her up and fiddle with the screws a quarter turn at a      time 'til the engine starts and runs well at idle and      hi-speed.    </p>    <p>      If this doesn't work, remove carb and attachments      (reserving all the stamped-metal throttle and choke      controls attached to the engine). Take the carb to a shop      along with serial numbers off the engine and see if they      have a quick fix. If not, order a new one. Be sure the new      one is adjusted properly when you pick it up. Carburetors      run from $5 to $50.    </p>    <h3>      Lube    </h3>    <p>      A machine that's been sitting for a while will need a      thorough greasing. Control levers must work easily and      wires must slip freely inside their sheaths.    </p>    <p>      If controls stick, soak with penetrating oil and work loose      if you can. Often it's easier just to replace the controls.      Generic handles and wire-and-sheath assemblies are      available off the rack at auto supply stores. One or the      other is sure to replace your old throttle, choke, and      light accessory controls.    </p>    <p>      Hot water and a degreasing detergent, a good solvent,      toothbrush, emery-paper, and elbow grease will clean up      most any machine. When all is de-gooked, de-gummed, and      shiny, blow water out of axles and engine parts and coat      all surfaces with light oil - or, prime and paint.    </p>    <p>      A certified antique may have shaft, pulley, or wheel      bearings with auto-type Alemite "Zerk" fittings that must      be greased. Look for little steel nubbins with a tiny ball      bearing in the center - located around shafts and      other major moving parts. If you find them, get a      cartridge-type grease gun and give the fittings a shot of      grease every week of heavy use. (Wipe fitting clean, push      nozzle tip on fitting 'til it pops tight and squeeze 'til      old grease oozes out.) Most newer equipment has sealed      bearings that don't need maintenance.    </p>    <p>      Machines with automotive-type transmissions and wheel/PTO      drives that run in oil need only to have the lube topped up      and changed any time it gets murky or you see the white,      waxy indication of water on the dip stick.    </p>    <p>      If balloon tires are shot, remove wheels and take to any      L&G shop, which will install new tires for you. You may      want to take the wheels home, sand, and paint them (with      special attention to the edges of the rim) before new tires      go on. Solid tires are bonded or sprung onto rims and the      whole thing must be replaced if rubber is badly cracked.    </p>    <p>      With engine and wheels off, remove shields covering drive      gear. You should be able to replace any worn belts, worn or      loose pulleys, and idler arms, as the hardware and parts      are available at auto parts stores. Floppy or broken drive      chains that can't be replaced and tightened with      intuitively-apparent adjustment screws and any work on gear      drives should be taken to a shop. It requires specialized      tools and know-how that you surely can acquire-but      the tools cost isn't justified. And the study required      would take time that's better spent gardening.    </p>    <h3>      Replacing Tines    </h3>    <p>      Tiller tines wear and lose efficiency faster then you might      think. But the loss of mass, length, and sharpness is so      gradual that few owners notice.    </p>    <p>      Check yours every now and again. If the end few inches of a      tine are noticeably thinner than where it fastens to the      reel, order a new set. Bolt-spacing is fairly standard and      a set of replacement tines from Sears will fit nearly any      generic front-ender. Many larger-hp, name-brand      front-enders and most rear-tined machines use custom tines.      Order from dealer or the parts/repair phones of      mail-order-sold machines. Cost for a set of 16 replacement      tines ranges from $20 for simple stampings used on small-hp      front-enders to around $75 for forged, complex-curved      "bolos."    </p>    <p>      Tines are either right- or left-handed, and they are      arrayed around the tine-reels in a complex, interwoven      pattern of right/left opposition that is easy to get      confused, so its easiest to remove and replace one tine at      a time. Confuse the pattern and you'll never get it right      again without consulting another machine.    </p>    <p>      On a used tiller (or just to maintain your own) you may      want to disassemble the whole lower unit to replace a drive      chain or to de-rust and repaint. Most tillers have four      tine-reel assemblies. Some are welded in one piece and must      be replaced entirely. On others, tine-stubs are welded to a      short section of tubing and the tines are bolted to stubs.    </p>    <p>      Tine-axle-tubing is held to axle shaft with a shear pin,      big cotter key, or a soft-steel bolt (all designed to shear      if subjected to excess stress). File deep scratches all      across tops of all the axle-tubes before removing them.      Scratch a notch on the axle drive shaft where the scratches      line up and scratch- number the assemblies right to left.      Then, file left or right arrows on the tine stubs, and you      can tear it all apart to clean it up good and get paint      into all the hidden crannies. Just don't quit the job and      store the loose parts in a box for six months, or you are      sure to forget what your scratch-code means... if the      scratches don't rust into oblivion.    </p>    <p>      Tines should come off with a pair of wrenches, tine      assemblies with a few whacks of a hammer. If frozen on,      soak with water to remove caked-on mud and with penetrating      oil (using a torch if need be ) to loosen rust. If that      doesn't do it, heat with a propane torch and work at it      with screwdrivers and a mallet. Then, wire-brush flat      pieces to bare metal and soak tube insides and inaccessible      surfaces with Naval Jelly or other rust-remover. Rinse with      hose, dry and dust good, spray-paint with a good metal      undercoat such as Rustoleum, and repaint within 24 hours      with two coats of hard gloss enamel. Grease axles and      hidden surfaces where tines bolt on, and fasten securely      with new galvanized or stainless steel (rustproof)      hardware. Apply the same procedure to exposed tin, handles,      and engine shrouds. Let paint harden for a week before      using the machine and you are good fog many more seasons of      power gardening    </p>    <p>      You are best advised to replace the relatively small blades      on conventional rotary mower attachments; even two- and      three-bladed models use standard blades But the thick      blades from multiple-blade commercial mowers and      "Brush-Hog" mowers are too expensive to discard. You'll      need a monkey wrench or a wrench and blade-holder to get      the blades off. Be sure to save any washers or blade-insert      that come off and remember where they go. Blade ends may be      badly dented. If so, even out with hammer and anvil or a      grinder. Then balance on a conical blade balancer (from any      small-engine parts rack) by grinding off the heavy side;      sharpen well and reattach.    </p>    <h3>      Replacing an Engine    </h3>    <p>      If the engine is shot, replacing it is easier than you may      think. Remove fuel lines and drain gas. Remove gas tank and      the whole carburetor-control assembly from engine. Remove      any reverse-controls and PTO links (to engines with a      second PTO shaft). Take off everything that's bolted to the      engine but the shroud where the starting rope is attached,      the carburetor, and muffler.    </p>    <p>      Then, remove the engine. It fastens to the machine with      four bolts arranged in a circle at its back, or with four      bolts in a square on the base. Measure bolt pattern, and      locate and record model numbers that are stamped into one      side or top of the shroud on smaller engines, into a flat      space on the cast-metal crankcase on larger sizes.    </p>    <p>      Pull at pulleys or gears attached to shaft If they don't      come off with a few hammer taps, take it to a shop with      gear pulleys and skilled staff, have them install gears on      the new engine as well. Then, buy an engine of the same or      one step greater horsepower with precisely the same bolt      pattern and shaft or shafts of the same diameter, length,      and spline slot (where a little half-moon shaped soft-metal      shear pin goes to secure engine shaft to pulley or drive      shaft of the machine itself.)    </p>    <p>      Good used engines can be had from want ads and some engine      shops for $50 , to $100. Many auto supply outlets sell new      ones. Best new engine prices I know of are available from      the catalog (free) from Northern (1-800-533-5545). Their      sales staff will give you all the help you need over the      phone to obtain the closest replacement possible.    </p>    <p>      A 2,500-hr 7 hp Tecumseh standard tiller engine costs about      $150 on sale, just under $200 otherwise. An 8 hp Briggs      & Stratton Industrial/Commercial for a big shredder or      tiller costs $375. A 10 hp Kohler with electric start for a      tiller/tractor costs $690. An 18 hp Onan or Honda twin (to      replace a shot engine on a Gravely "L") costs $1,100. All      mfgrs. offer standard, I/C, electric start and other      premium options.    </p>    <p>      You don't have to get a carbon copy of your old engine.      Indeed, the original brand and/or model may not be      available any more. Only shaft-sizes and engine-mount-holes      must match on original and replacement.    </p>    <p>      Do your best to get an engine that eliminates known      problems with the original. For example, many tillers come      equipped with engines with a carburetor that sticks out to      one side of the engine and can be broken off easily against      shed-door jams and fence posts. Among the replacements      available are several with less-hazardous designs. I once      replaced a conventional 7 hp tiller engine with a 5 hp      "Robin" that had the carb mounted safely at the rear of the      engine. Like most replacements, it came with a      self-contained throttle assembly, so I didn't bother to      reattach the handle-mounted throttle control but took it      off entirely and regulated engine speed at the engine.      Today, the 5 hp Robin costs $290-a third more      expensive but with 50 percent more service life than      standard engines.    </p>    <p>      I removed the pancake-style gas tank, wired the original      (oblong-box) gas tank onto the handle cross-bar and      connected it to the new carb with a length of armored fuel      line. I put a gas filter in mid- line and a fuel shut-off      on the tank bottom, so I was able to keep the fuel clean      and fuel the tiller while the engine was hot without fear      of an explosion.    </p>    <p>      Once you've replaced an engine yourself (and realize how      simple it is), you'll find that such custom modifications      just sort of come to you. And with the confidence borne of      performing such a seemingly formidable task, you'll find      all kinds of auto-type mechanics easy.    </p>
