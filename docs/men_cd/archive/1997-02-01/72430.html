                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY SKILLS</strong>    </p>    		    <p>      <strong>Ultralight aircraft are cheap, easy to fly and      assemble.. and you don't have to be a pilot to own one.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Matthew Scanlon    </h5>        <p>      It starts with a gentle rumbling in the seat of your pants,      and a sudden burst of wind and speed that causes the skin      on the back of your neck to tighten and your hand to firm      on the stick. Tires pitch and shake for a moment over      clumps arid irregularities in the grass strip and any local      dogs come bounding. The small engine mounted just ahead of      the pilot's seat winds up and sends vibrations through the      cab as the ground, barely a foot from your shoes, gradually      and then suddenly fades away. The same engine that appeared      so small on .the ground, pulls you into the sky with      amazing certainty. Nerves quickly ease, replaced by a      spreading grin ...whether it's your first flight or      fiftieth y.Almost impossibly, it seems, local cornfields      and pumpkin patches that you've only seen from the stunted      view of the highways suddenly become a mosaic of colors and      details. Once you get to just over a thousand feet from the      fields, the kid in you takes over and you throw the      aircraft into sorne tight turns and steep des cents over the      pine trees.    </p>    <p>      Ultralight aircraft just shouldn't exist in a country in      which you are no longer permitted to go without a seatbelt,      in which insurance costs for an average car regularly      exceed $2,000 a year. The freedom to fly an airplane that      you build yourself, maintain yourself, and take absolute      personal responsibility for is so redolent of the visions      we had for this country in the first place...that it is      simply too good to be true.    </p>    <h3>      The Private Pilot Maze    </h3>		            <p>      There is arguably no industry in the world as heavily      regulated as powered flight. Becoming a private pilot      typically requires 50-60 hours of flight instruction as      well as ground school, which combined take five to seven      months to complete. Lesson expenses vary, but graduating      with a license for less than $4,000 would constitute a      miracle. Completing a Class-3 medical exam is also      mandatory, which weeds out, of course, any candidates with      major health problems or those who've had procedures such      as by-pass surgery. Vision acuity of no worse than 20/40 is      also required. Of course, costs of the licensing procedure      are dwarfed by the daunting prospect of actually affording      a plane. Recently, Cessna announced that they were      re-releasing their venerable 172-class small airplane, at      the industry-shattering cost of <em>just</em> $170,000.      Burn 40 or 50 gallons of "av-gas" (aviation fuel) a crack      and see the lifetime costs escalate further, both for      yourself and the environment you pour the exhaust into.    </p>    <p>      Once in the air, much of a private pilot's time is spent      adhering to the rules of the road. Takeoff, landing, and      flight path patterns must be rigidly adhered to, meaning      that significant amounts of time must be spent simply      plotting position and correcting course, speed, and      altitude.    </p>            <p>      It's difficult to fault the government for these      regulations; they are all intended to keep planes safely in      the air, but many pilots have suggested to me that      somewhere along the endless line of well-intentioned,      sensible rules, all the fun has been taken out of flying.      The industry is and always will be at odds with itself.      Flight is freedom, a temporary compromise with air and      gravity, and the more we weigh it down with earthly      considerations, the less enjoyable it becomes. My dream of      flying ended when an eye exam revealed, even with      corrective lenses, that my vision was 20/60 or thereabouts.      After a lifetime of dreaming of model planes, graduating to      casual study and then to endless hours hanging around at      the local airport in Burlington, VT, I was forced to turn      tail and move on. There has been an alternative to this      dilemma, though much maligned, for over a generation,      however.    </p>    <h3>Barnstorming Revisited</h3>    <p>      The modern ultralight movement was born when NASA invented      the Rogallo wing in the mid-1960s. Small and light with      incredible lift characteristics, the experimental wing made      pioneer hanggliders very curious. Pilots of these early      gliders would control direction and angle of ascent or      attack by simply shifting their weight. With a good      understanding of how to steer the wing, as well as      "thermals," or the powerful updrafts of hot air that could      lift a glider several thousand feet, flights of an hour or      more were possible. By the early 1970s, a few enterprising      hang-gliders bolted twostroke chain saw engines outfitted      with propellers to the frame, and the ultralight was born.      Considering these novice builders as merely dangers to      themselves, the government ignored them.    </p>           <p>      The Fed's "laissez-faire" attitude ended when FAA      investigators discovered that landing gear was appearing on      these very experimental aircraft. The FAA then declared      that engines were permitted but that the plane would have      to be "foot launched" at all times, their thinking being      that gear meant speed, and they wanted ultralights to be as      slow as possible. In a trend that continues today with      countless renegade tinkerers in backyards across North      America, builders simply ignored the regulations and      designed heavier and faster ultralights. MOTHER jumped at      the chance to underwrite several different models and      airshows, including an ethanolfueled, cross-country trip in      1979.    </p>    <p>      More than anything else, the mid 1970s era of rabid      experimentation mimicked the earliest days of aviation, in      which no design, however ridiculous or dangerous, was      unexplored. Engines that were essentially lawn-mower and      chain saw knockoffs were tinkered and ratcheted up to very      torquey, high revving output, and of course they frequently      failed. Training was virtually non-existent, since the vast      majority of ultralights were one-seaters. Aspiring pilots      would just hop into the seat, grab the stick, and fly. The      reader is left to imagine the consequences. Biplanes, twin      engines, even canard (a plan in which basically the plane      was built backwards, with the tail in the lead) designs      were built by the thousands ...and as might be expected,      injuries and fatalities proliferated.    </p>    <p>      Deservedly or not, ultralight manufacturers (rather than      irresponsible pilots) soon acquired an unsavory reputation.      The final nail in the coffin came when the ABC news program      "20/20" ran a feature segment detailing several fatal      crashes. Veterans still regard that one hour of evening      news as the end of an era, and in their circles there is      still much gnashing of teeth at the mere mention of anchor      Hugh Downs's name. Orders ceased nationwide, and virtually      all of the manufacturers slowed or ceased production. Even      MOTHER ceased writing about ultralights after 1981.    </p>           <p>      In the truest tradition of locking the barndoor after the      cow has wandered out, solutions were appearing just as the      end was near. Rotax 2-stroke engines began to appear in the      marketplace in the late 1970s, which were not only      light-years ahead of their predecessors in ruggedness and      reliability, but also featured "reduction drives" which      produced more power per cc of engine and allowed the use of      larger propellers turning at slower speeds. More      importantly, the BRS ballistic parachute was designed,      tested, and ready for market by 1986. In the event that the      pilot lost control or experienced a structural failure, one      depressed button would fire a rocket-powered parachute to      the rear and the plane would float to the ground. The      industry was maturing, but the new models debuted to very      small audiences.    </p>    <p>      Then, in 1982, the FAA adopted part 103 of the Federal      Aviation Regulations, which defined specifically what an      ultralight could and could not be. The ultralight was      defined in the code as a oneseat aerial recreational      vehicle that must weigh no more than 254 pounds (without      pilot), must carry no more than 5 gallons of fuel, must      travel no faster than 55 knots (about 63 mph), and must      have a stall speed of no faster than 24 knots. Other parts      of the code dictated that the planes could not be flown at      night, could not be flown in clouds, over congested      population centers or in controlled airspace (those lanes      reserved for larger air traffic). Finally, two-seat      aircraft were allowed for the purposes of training. The      regulations have remained unchanged ever since.    </p>    <p>      And slowly, over ten years, the industry recovered.    </p>    <p>      One happy by-product of the house cleaning was that all of      the manufacturers with less than exemplary records were      eliminated, leaving a dozen or so to continue innovating,      and most were (and are) members of United States Ultralight      Association (USUA), which tries to keep a control on      building standards as well as maintain safety reports.    </p>           <h3>The First and Last Question</h3>    <p>      What any aspiring ultralight pilot wants is precisely what      manufacturers have tried to give him: a rugged, dependable,      safe aircraft...and here, strangely enough, is where FAA      regulations hamper progress. A Rotax 503, the industry      standard powerplant with sufficient horsepower for even the      larger two-Beaters, weighs nearly 100 lbs. Good five point      harnesses and seats weigh 20-30 lbs each, and a ballistic      parachute nearly as much. Add the barest instrumentation to      measure altitude, engine temperature, and RPMs and a      console to house them and you're adding 30 more pounds. The      design dilemma is now clear. The FAA, by insisting that the      craft weigh no more than 254 pounds, is, according to most      design firms, legislating dangerous vehicles. Which      component would they suggest we do without?    </p>    <p>      The solution to the restrictive regulation was years in the      making and striking in its simplicity: the weight      restriction was...ignored. Though not a racketeering effort      by A1 Capone-standards, the mass avoidance of Federal      Regulations and the unapologetic sale of hundreds of      technically illegal vehicles is unprecedented. One glance      at a sales catalog will prove that point. Just about one in      ten single-seat models weighs in properly. Why does the      government allow that to happen? I asked Tom Peghiny of      Flightstar Sportplanes that very question.    </p>    <p>      "Well, I think that even the FAA recognizes that building      overweight singleseat ultralights, if they are overweight      due to additional safety features, is a victimless crime.      It's the carrying of passengers that is a real hot button      issue."    </p>    <p>      From a liability standpoint alone, Tom hit on the central      issue. Carrying a passenger in an illegal plane that      crashes, resulting in injuries, is a liability nightmare      for the plane owner and a public relations nightmare for      the industry.    </p>    <p>      "...And inevitably, the question of safety defines our      business. People have to understand that when they step      into an ultralight, they are taking a risk as surely as      stepping into an automobile is a risk. It isn't safe. Life      isn't safe. Once that premise is understood, ultralight      aviation has had a remarkable safety record in recent      years."    </p>    <p>      "Has an engine ever gone out on you?"    </p>    <p>      "Actually, yes, I was taking a reporter for a ride years      ago, we lost the engine and I landed the plane in a field,      not realizing that there were a bunch of Brahma bulls in      the far end, heading in our direction."    </p>    <p>      I examined Tom for artificial limbs and large scars, but      found none.    </p>    <p>      "Yeah [laughing], I was scared to death when they all came      over and sniffed at the framework, but the reporter, who I      guess knew his way around a bull, just shook the plane and      they jumped back and went away. That was the one and only      time I've lost an engine in thousands of ultralight      flights. And don't forget that these aircraft are      essentially gliders...with parachutes for good measure. An      irresponsible owner who lacks training or has a      thrill-seeking streak may well crash his plane, just as an      inattentive auto driver will."    </p>    <p>      Tom sells about 75 ultralights a year from his shop in      Ellington, CT, nearly all of them as kits that the owners      will then piece together themselves. By and large, the      assembly is uncomplicated but time consuming. It is not      necessary to know how to read a blueprint, nor is any kind      of welding required. Most of the fastenings are nuts and      bolts, and although some mechanical knowledge wouldn't      hurt, kits from most manufacturers were not designed with      experts in mind. After going through the assembly process      (see Assembling an Ultralight Kit), I imagined that I'd      need three hard-working weekends to complete the kit. The      reason Tom sells so few fully assembled ultralights is      threefold: 1) Most of the orders need to be shipped      considerable distances, and a top speed of 70-90 mph and a      1 1/2 to 2 hour supply of gasoline means flying a long,      long way home; 2) buying assembled kits would mean nearly      doubling the price of the ultralight; and 3) most of the      people who buy ultralights would have no wish to fly around      in an aircraft that they had no hand in constructing.      Buying one is an investment in yourself...and it's very      reassuring to know that every bolt and spar had your hand      on it.    </p>    <p>      The same holds true of the engine. Just as in a      conventional aircraft, ultralight engines have recommended      TBO (Time Before Overhaul) ratings. For Rotax engines the      running time before the engine needs to be overhauled is      approximately 300 hours. Regular engine maintenance is      performed in the field, according to a Rotax specified      inspection and maintenance schedule. The typical tasks      include the retorquing of the head bolts and manifolds,      adjustment of the carburetor jetting, and periodic removal      of piston carbon. Knowing the condition of the engine and      becoming intimately familiar with its components is simply      another of the personal responsibilities associated with      this sport.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Modern Ultralights</strong>    </p>           <p>      Three families of aircraft comprise the modern ultralight      fleet. The first is the fixed wing design, such as Tom      Peghiny's Spyder and Flightstar II. Such kits feature rigid      aluminum or composite wings covered typically with dacron      sailcloth, comparatively enclosed seating areas and some      instrumentation. They are the most complicated kits to      assemble, the most expensive to buy, and the heaviest      ultralights in the air. The second family is referred to as      "trikes," and encompasses all those ultralights in which      engines and pilot cages are attached to a modified,      flexiblewing hang-glider. The third family, often called      "para-planes," is simply the same engine and cage of a      trike bolted to a parachute. Their defining concept, as      might be imagined, is the safety of a vehicle which has a      permanently deployed parachute, but speed is sacrificed in      the process. A para-plane's top speed will rarely exceed      30-35 mph.    </p>    <p>      The amount of diversity within this three-fold family is      amazing, however. Several fixed wing models have completely      enclosed cabins with heaters, intercoms and air to ground      radios, and are virtually indistinguishable from small      airplanes. Many designers offer floats to their ultralights      which have proved to be extremely popular. The thought of      grabbing some fishing gear, hopping into an ultralight, and      buzzing to a small island off the coast was more than      enough to makes eyes and mouths water around here. Ski      attachments are also available, and there are hundreds of      Northern U.S. and Canadian ultralight owners who think      nothing of taking off and landing on snow covered backyards      and frozen lakes from British Columbia to Maine.    </p>    <h3>The Bottom Lines</h3>    <p>      Thankfully, gone are the days of self-taught ultralight      lessons, but shopping around for a good flight school is as      critical for an ultralight pilot as it is for private      pilots. No program worth half its asking price will include      tag lines such as "Get in the Air in Three Hours!" They      make for great ads, but generally poor flight instruction.      Good schools will let you learn at your own pace, and very      rarely let any student pilot solo without 20-25 hours in      the saddle. Why are ultralight pilots born of less than      half the amount of time it takes to create a private pilot?      The answer is in the design of the aircraft. They are      simply easy to fly, with foot pedals controlling the rudder      and stick controlling the wing aeliorons, just as in a      conventional airplane, but at bruising speeds of 1/2 to 1/3      that of a larger plane, the process is very forgiving.      Ultralights stall at about 28 mph, which means that they      basically land at that speed, and even a very clumsy      attempt at touching down has minimal consequences. After an      hour in the air, I felt completely comfortable leaning into      tight turns and making approaches to the landing strip.      Wind was a steady 10 kt from the north gusting to 15 kt,      and the ultralight felt rock solid throughout. I've taken      flights in larger aircraft under similar conditions and      experienced more buffeting, another tribute to slow speed      flight.    </p>    <p>      At $50 an hour, flight school will run you approximately      $1,250, and kit prices range from $5,000 to $8,000 for      para-planes, $7,000 to $9,000 for trikes, and $5,000 to      $15,000 (or more, depending upon the amount of extras and      gadgetry you require) for fixed wing models. This is not an      inconsiderable expense, to say the least, but it is still      half of what a new family car would run you, runs neck and      neck with a new fishing boat, and is still less than      one-tenth of what a private pilot license and small plane      would require from your wallet. After researching the dozen      or so major ultralight manufacturers, it became      increasingly clear to us that careful shopping will reap      huge rewards. The price range in the fixed-wing category,      for instance, is so large that a little assiduous phone      calling and brochure reading can easily save a buyer      $5,000. Yet it is at least as important (if not more so) to      get some company history while you are shopping. How long      has the company been in business? How personally involved      in the design have they been, or are they merely      distributors of a larger company's designs? Don't be      bashful about asking for accident reports or incidents of      structural failure. Any good company will immediately      report what you can safely do with their aircraft or any      problems they've experienced in the past.    </p>    <p>      What many ultralight owners opt to do, to further reduce      their costs, is share the expense of a kit with a friend      and keep the ultralight at a local airpark, or in a      backyard if there's an expanse of grass more than a few      hundred feet long.    </p>    <p>      Finding, at long last, an opportunity not only to escape      the confines of ground and gravity but the entanglements of      the federal bureaucracy is ultimately what keeps ultralight      enthusiasts in the pilot's seat. I spoke with Donald McKay      one afternoon near a local airport as he was in the process      of celebrating not only his 70th birthday, but his new      ultralight license. "My son was a military and commercial      pilot and I've always had the bug to get in the air, but      lacked either the time or the money. It's just great fun      for us older guys to have an opportunity to get back to the      'Smiling Jack' stick and rudder days when the sport of      flying ...was a sport."    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly, most ultralight buyers are not daredevil kids      looking for a cheap thrill but women and men very much like      Don. Whether they were ex-pilots who can't pass the      physical or business people who've just never had the      opportunity to fly before now, the sport has given them a      second chance to get a taste of the air.    </p>    <p>      As I cruised over the Connecticut River that afternoon,      watching the stone-walled farmland patchwork extending to      the edge of the Adirondacks, 2,000 feet in the air, I      glanced over my left shoulder and saw a formation of geese      not 200 feet away, marking the season. As I banked right to      give them some room, it occurred to me, I was as happy as      I'd been in months.    </p>    <h3>ASSEMBLING AN ULTRALIGHT KIT</h3>
