                <p>      Vastly more flavorful sweet corn, tomatoes, cabbage,      cucumbers, snap beans, radishes, yams, and squash! That's      what Derek Fell-former manager of the Burpee seed      catalog, author of Countryside Books' <em>How to Plant a      Vegetable Garden,</em> one-time director of All-America      Selections (the national seed trials), and gardener par      excellence-promises ... and delivers.    </p>        <p>      When I was new to the seed business, I found it difficult      to understand how anyone could breed a "better" vegetable      variety ... an improved type of cabbage, say. Cabbage is      cabbage, I reasoned. How in the world could anyone claim to      have improved upon a crop that's been cultivated for      hundreds-perhaps <em>thousands</em> -of years?    </p>        <p>      Eventually-as I gained experience raising and writing      about new vegetables-I began to see how breeders      could indeed create better crop varieties ... varieties      that (through increased disease resistance, added      productivity, etc.) could ensure greater success and      enjoyment for the home gardener.    </p>    <p>      I also began to realize that although vegetables can be      bred for many characteristics-early maturation, large      size, extra vigor, high nutritional value, bright color,      and so on- <em>good flavor</em> is probably the single most      important quality a vegetable can have. After all, a tomato      can possess exceptional disease resistance or have      tremendous productivity ... but if it doesn't taste good,      what's the point in growing it?    </p>   <h3>FACTORS THAT AFFECT FLAVOR</h3>    <p>      In order to grow truly tasty vegetables, one must know      something about the factors that affect the development of      good flavor. Factors such as:    </p>        <p>      [1] THE AGE OF THE VEGETABLE (OR FRUIT) AT HARVEST. As a      rule, the mildest - and best-tasting vegetables are      those that've been harvested as soon as possible after      they've matured. This is particularly true of root crops,      such as turnips and carrots.    </p>    <p>      [2] WEATHER. Moist, cool conditions favor the development      of good flavor in root crops and leafy vegetables (lettuce,      cabbage, etc.), while sunshine and summer-like temperatures      promote palatability in melons, sweet corn, tomatoes,      eggplant, and other warmweather fare. (Proper amounts of      moisture, of course, are also vital to these crops. Drought      conditions - for instance - at the time of      ripening can drastically affect the eating qualities of      corn and melons.)    </p>    <p>      [3] GENETIC BACKGROUND OF THE PARENT PLANT. Thanks to the      efforts of seed companies and independent plant breeders      the world over, home gardeners needn't eat the pithy,      tasteless droppings of agribiz. Instead, they can grow      spectacularly flavorful varieties of vegetables ... strains      that've been bred not for good transportability or long      shelf life, but for <em>outstanding taste.</em> Let's take      a look at some of the more toothsome vegetable varieties      currently offered by seed companies, and the problems (if      any) peculiar to them.    </p>    <h3>SUPER-SWEET CORN, ANYONE?</h3>        <p>      There's a familiar saying that in order to eat delicious      corn you've got to have the water boiling as you pick the      ears. With standard varieties of sweet corn, this is true      ... but not so with the new "super sweet" strains, such as      Early Xtra Sweet and Illini Xtra Sweet. Thanks to the      presence of what plant breeders call "extra sweet" genes,      the conversion of sugar to starch takes place much more      slowly in these varieties than in other types of corn ...      making it possi ble to enjoy good-tasting ears several days      after they've been picked.    </p>    <p>      Super-sweet corns do have one drawback: They must be kept      isolated, since cross-pollination with regular sweet corn      will result in loss of the varieties' unique flavor.      Breeders, however, are well on the way to developing      improved super-sweets that don't require isolation. (I'm      told that one of these-Golden Beauty-will be      available this year for the first time. See the      accompanying sidebar, "Where to Obtain the Vegetable      Varieties Mentioned in This Article", for the addresses of      seedsmen.)    </p>    <p>      Another incredibly delectable sweet corn-a dazzling      white hybrid-is Silver Queen. Despite the fact that      it matures slowly (it needs 92 days, on the average, from      planting to harvest), the supersweet taste and huge ears of      this relative newcomer have already converted many folks      from yellow to white corn.    </p>    <h3>POLE BEANS FOR OLD-TIME GOOD TASTE</h3>    <p>      Sweet corn is one crop the flavor of which has been vastly      improved in recent years. But that game is played both      ways. I can, for instance, name a least one "old favorite"      which-though developed long ago-tastes better      than its modern equivalents. That old favorite is a pole      bean called Lazy Wife, which was first introduced in the      1880's and then dropped from most catalogs around 1930.    </p>    <p>      Lazy Wife does have several faults. Lack of resistance to      disease, for one Extreme sensitivity to cold temperatures      (seeds must be planted well after any danger of frost), for      another. And slow maturation (you're not likely to get a      first picking until late August or early September), for a      third. But its plump, buttery-flavored, completely      stringless beans are superb eating, and the older they get      the better they taste (until, finally, the pods turn yellow      and brittle).    </p>    <p>      You can buy Lazy Wife from R.H. Shumway (see accompanying      sidebar).    </p>    <h3>BUSH BEANS: EASY GROWING, EASY EATING</h3>        <p>      Although pole beans generally taste better-and crop      over a longer period-than bush-type snap beans, many      gardeners find the compact bush varieties easier to grow.      For such grow-your-own enthusiasts, I recommend: [1] a      savory new dwarf Romano called Roma, and [2] the delicious      new yellow wax bean called Goldcrop. (The latter produces      heavy yields of long, straight, pencil-thin and      icicle-brittle pods.)    </p>    <h3>BURPLESS CUCUMBERS</h3>    <p>      It's probably hard for a beginning gardener to believe that      the mild flavor of a cucumber can vary from one variety to      the next, but it can ... and does. If you doubt my      statement, try growing the new, non-bitter Burpless      cucumber this summer. Its long, slender, dark-green fruits      are heavily spined, but so tender you can eat 'em      whole-skin and all-just like sticks of candy.      (And, if you grow the plants on a trellis so that the      maturing cukes hang straight down and don't curl, they'll      also be as <em>straight</em> as sticks of candy.)    </p>    <p>      I met the "inventor" of the Burpless cucumber-Mr. T.      Sakata-during a recent visit to Japan. When asked why      he'd chosen to call the plant "Burpless", he replied that      the name had been suggested to him by an American housewife      who found that the fruits failed to give her indigestion      ... and he liked it.    </p>    <h3>TASTE-TEMPTING TURNIPS</h3>    <p>      When I was young, I was served turnips with school dinners,      and-as many youngsters do-found them repugnant.      For that reason I avoided eating the vegetable altogether      for the next several years.    </p>    <p>      Then one day-at a barbecue buffet-I helped      myself to some small, white, golf-ball-like victuals that I      thought were new potatoes. They were sensationaljuicy,      super-sweet, mild-but definitely not potatoes. I was later      amazed to discover that what I had eaten were, in fact,      turnips ... a new variety called Tokyo Cross. I've been      growing them in my garden ever since.    </p>    <p>      The beauty of Tokyo Cross turnips is that they mature      within just 35 days of the time they're planted. For best      flavor, pick them when they're the size of baby beets.      (They can be left to grow larger, if you wish ...      and-of course-their tops are edible.)    </p>    <h3>TOMATOES (LARGE AND SMALL)</h3>        <p>      If you like tomatoes-and you want to experience good      "old-fashioned" flavor-I recommend you try a variety      (first introduced around 1892) called Ponderosa. The      pinkish-red flesh of this tomato is exceptionally meaty,      with very few seeds, and has a smooth, low-acid flavor.      Although Ponderosa is a late-maturing variety and won't win      any prizes for productivity, the gigantic (up to two pounds      apiece), succulent fruit are-in my opinion-well      worth the wait.    </p>    <p>      Then again, for a dependable combination of good size,      superb flavor, AND high yield you might want to try Joseph      Harris's Supersonic tomatoes. I grow several varieties of      "love apples" every year out of curiosity, but I always      rely on Supersonics for my main crop of beautiful, red      fruit.    </p>    <p>      And a new cherry tomato that's being offered for the first      time this year is Sweet 100 ... so called because [A] it's      sweet-tasting and [B] it has the remarkable ability to      produce 100 ripe tomatoes on a single stem ( <em>500 or      more fruits per plant</em> ). According to its creators,      Sweet 100 is not only flavorful and prolific but it also      has the highest vitamin C content of any tomato.    </p>    <p>      I grew Sweet 100 in my garden last year and can vouch for      the fruit's superb taste. (I was also fascinated by the way      the plant's long, slender flower stems uncurled like watch      springs before giving rise to numerous fruit-studded      side-stems.)    </p>   <h3>CABBAGE PAR EXCELLENCE</h3>        <p>      Cabbage-lovers agree that the savoy varieties-with      their dark, crinkly outer leaves and sunshine-yellow      centers-are tops in the flavor department. And one of      the best-tasting of these is the new Savoy Ace, which      All-America Selections has chosen a gold medal winner for      1977. The tight, solid heads of this magnificent vegetable      will stand in the garden for more than a month without      bursting, even in the hottest weather ... and the flavor      certainly won't let you down. Try it. You'll love it.    </p>   <h3> THE SECRET OF GOOD RADISHES</h3>    <p>      My favorite radish is the Cherry Belle, a red variety with      crisp white flesh that's ready to eat within 22 days of      planting ... providing there's been no hot and/or dry      weather during the intervening period. (Constant moisture      throughout the growing period-and an early harvest      thereafter-is the secret of clean-tasting, crisp      radishes.)    </p>   <h3>"SNAP PEAS"</h3>        <p>      Unless I'm wrong, the entire gardening world is about to be      revolutionized by an entirely new type of vegetable called      Snap Peas. This edible-podded pea will feature many of the      characteristics of snap beans, yet will be earlier than      beans, sweeter-tasting than sugar peas, and twice as      productive as any green pea. (If you ask me-and I've been      growing trial plantings of this unusual vegetable for some      time-Snap Peas will, when they hit the market in a      couple years, vie with the tomato in national popularity.      They're that good.)    </p>    <p>      Until we can all grow Snap Peas, however, the best we can      do is to sow our regular peas early and provide them with      plenty of moisture to bring out their full flavor.      (Moisture is particularly important to these plants, since      even the slightest dry spell will halt their growth.)    </p>    <h3>YAMS</h3>        <p>      Have you grown sweet potatoes lately? I tried raising them      years ago as a beginner, with poor results. Last year,      however, I had good luck with two varieties-a vine by      the name of Centennial and a bush-type called Puerto      Rico-which I planted as late succession crops in      place of some spinach.    </p>    <p>      Centennial came through with the highest yields (and pretty      fair flavor), but the P.R.'s had a more distinctive taste      ... one that reminded me of roasted chestnuts. From now on,      I'll never be without my Centennials for sheer size and      yields ... but-for that uniquely nutty      flavor-I'll also always grow Puerto Ricos.    </p>  <h3> SQUASH</h3>    <p>      It's hard to generalize about the flavor of squash, since      there are so many kinds (and since personal tastes vary so      widely). As a rule, though, winter squash varieties (acorn,      butternut, Hubbard) tend to have a deeper, more filling      flavor than summer varieties (zucchini, yellow crookneck,      etc.), and-among the winter varieties-the      vine-growing types seem to be tastier than bush types.    </p>    <p>      For the past several years, I've tested a really      remarkable-and incredibly large-new winter      squash called Pie Squash, Tahiti Squash, or      Melon-Squash. (I prefer the last name.) The      individual fruits-which grow to 40 pounds on vines      that resemble those of butternut squash-of this plant are      bow-shaped and feature a round, golden-yellow seed cavity      at one end, with an enormous neck full of edible flesh at      the other. When immature, the fruits are dark green ... but      as they ripen, they turn a yellow color outside and a deep      orange inside.    </p>        <p>      I love to cut small pieces of Melon-Squash into sticks or      wafers and eat them with dips. (The sweet and flavorful raw      flesh has the texture of a carrot      and-roughly-the flavor of a cantaloupe.) The      meat, however, is also delicious when boiled for a few      minutes, or fried in batter and served for breakfast.    </p>    <p>      Melon-Squash seeds will be available (for the first time)      this year from Thompson & Morgan.    </p>   <h3>OTHER VEGETABLES, OTHERFLAVORS</h3>    <p>      In this short space I haven't been able to discuss anywhere      near <em>all</em> the distinctive and delicious varieties      of vegetables that are currently available from seedsmen.      (Rather, I've limited myself to just a few of my personal      favorites.) I hope, however, that this discussion has      inspired you to try new and unusual garden varieties of all      kinds ... and that-as a result-you'll      experience for yourself the kind of flavors that are so      good, you (and your friends) will never forget them.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO GROW DOWNRIGHT DELICIOUS MELONS</h3>    <p>      Fertile soil and warm, sunny weather at the time of      ripening are critical to the development of superb flavor      in melons. For this reason, I always [1] grow my      cantaloupes and watermelons in a special bed loaded with      well-decomposed horse manure (and supplemented with a      general-purpose fertilizer), and [2] make at least two      plantings-spaced a couple of weeks apart-so that even      if one crop becomes waterlogged as a result of a rainy      spell during the last crucial days of ripening, the other      probably will still be OK.    </p>    <p>      Also, a black plastic "mulch" is definitely beneficial to      melon crops, since it serves to advance ripening, conserve      moisture, and maintain an even soil temperature      (which-in turn-keeps those fruits growing      happily even on chilly nights).    </p>    <h3>WATERMELON HINTS</h3>        <p>      If you're growing watermelons for the first time, I'd      recommend you start out with a new ice box variety called      Yellow Baby. This fruit's unusual, pineappleyellow flesh is      absolutely delectable (right down to the outermost      millimeter or two of skin), and averages 50% fewer seeds      than other ice box varieties. (Moreover, I'm told by the      plant's Chinese breeder that Yellow Baby is one of the most      cold-tolerant of all watermelons.) I've grown this novel      fruit for three years now, and haven't had a bad one yet.    </p>    <p>      Seedless watermelons aren't particularly easy to      grow-they require higher temperatures to ripen and      must have another hybrid nearby to act as a      pollinator-but if you feel up to the task, I can't      think of a more splendid variety to try than Burpee's      Triple Sweet Seedless Hybrid. Triple Sweet's succulent,      sugarsweet fruit makes all other watermelons seem insipid      by comparison.    </p>    <h3>CANTALOUPES</h3>        <p>      The selection of cantaloupe varieties is a very personal      matter. Some folks like the highly productive and      large-fruited Burpee Hybrid ... others are loyal to such      varieties as Pride of Wisconsin or Honey Rock. For sheer      mouthwatering flavor, however, I'll take an Israeli      cantaloupe called Haogen any day. The outer flesh of this      small (5" to 6" across), smooth-skinned melon is greenish      in color, with a salmon-tinted seed cavity ... and the      taste is-just as the Burpee catalog says-      indescribably delicious.    </p>    <p>      Give Heogen a try. I think you'll find-as I have-that      It's the best-tasting cantaloupe of all.-      <em>DF</em> .    </p>   <h3> WHERE TO OBTAIN THE VEGETABLE VARIETIES MENTIONED      IN THIS ARTICLE</h3>    <p>      Burpee Hybrid cantaloupe<br />      Honey Rock cantaloupe<br />      Pride of Wisconsin cantaloupe<br />      Illini Xtra Sweet corn<br />      Silver Oueen corn<br />      Roma snap bean<br />      Triple Sweet watermelon<br />      Yellow Baby watermelon    </p>    <p>      W.
