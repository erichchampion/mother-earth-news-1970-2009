    <p>
             		          <p>      There's an old American proverb (you probably first heard      it in grade school)that says: dictum, you should n't try      even <em>try to confront</em> the Powers That Be ...      because "you can't win".    </p>    <p>      "I guess I never learned that proverb," says John A.      Kolezynski of Long Valley, New Jersey," Beacuse when the      creameries - and the Department of Health-in my      state conspired to me out of the fdairy bussiness, I was      'dumb' enough to fight back. And when I did I found out      something interesting about the American system of justice:      It still works. Sometimes."    </p>    <p>      On April 15, 1974, I received a summons to appear in court.      I was being sued by the state of New Jersey.    </p>    <p>      Specifically, I was charged with violating a state law      which read: "No person shall sell or distribute to the      ultimate consumer any milk, cream, or other unpasteurized      dairy product that is not certified." On May 10, 1974 (the      summons said) I was to appear before his honor, Judge      Robert H. Muir, Jr., at the Morris County Superior Court,      to receive a "cease and desist" order.    </p>    <h3>TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING ...</h3>    <p>      I'm a dairy farmer. (Have been since 1947.) And I enjoy      what I do ... but I've never harbored any desire to become      a giant in the world of agribusiness. I've never wanted to      become a "big-time" dairy farmer ... although when I was      younger, that was what I <em>thought</em> I <em>had</em> to      do to keep my business profitable.    </p>    <p>      Back in the fifties, my wife and I expanded our operation      from 13 to 50-some-odd cows (and mortgaged the better part      of our lives to buy 123 acres of land). At our peak, we      managed a herd that produced a ton of milk per day.    </p>        <p>      What we couldn't understand at the time, though, was      why-in the process of becoming <em>bigger</em>      -we'd also become <em>poorer</em> . We were in debt      up to (and beyond) our ears, and while most of the rest of      the nation enjoyed prosperity, <em>we</em> lived in a      depression ... as did millions of other farm families who      were trying desperately to hold onto their land.    </p>    <p>      We were luckier than many of the others, though. We got out      of debt ... by selling most of our land. (Notice that it      was not our <em>production</em> -our milk-that      paid off our debts, but our <em>means</em> of production:      our cows and our land.) A funny thing happened, though,      when we became smaller: We also became more efficient.    </p>    <p>      The System, however, doesn't reward efficiency (on a small      scale) ... as I learned on February 28, 1972, when I      received a registered letter from my creamery stating      that-because of my herd's small output (250 pounds      daily)-they would no longer pick up my milk. I had 60      days (the letter said) to find another market for it.    </p>    <h3>THE BATTLE BEGINS</h3>        <p>      Upon receiving my "layoff" notice from the creamery, I      immediately began to get in touch with other creameries.      And, to my amazement and dismay, they all told me the same      thing: "Make more milk, and we'll take you on."    </p>    <p>      I wrote to New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Phillip      Alampi to see if maybe <em>he</em> could find a market for      my milk. He wrote back to say that he couldn't locate a      creamery that would pick up such a small volume. A few days      later, I wrote Mr. Alampi again to ask whom I could contact      with regard to having my milk certified (so I could sell it      myself) ... and he was kind enough to send me a list of      names. I contacted everyone on the list, but the answer was      the same: my production was too small to bother with.    </p>    <p>      As a last resort, I wrote to the Governor and explained my      situation. His answer (which I received via the Secretary      of Agriculture) was, "It's distressing that we in      government do not have a solution to the problems that you      are now facing, but don't you dare sell raw milk."    </p>    <p>      My 60 days were nearly up at this point and-as      yet-I had found no new buyer for my small farm's      product. "I guess we'll have to go on welfare pretty soon,"      I told my wife. "Because after May first, we aren't going      to have an income."    </p>    <h3>THE WELFARE EXPERIENCE</h3>    <p>      Around the middle of April, my wife and I did go down to      the Morris County welfare office, where we filled out a      large application form. When we turned it in, the clerk      told me to sign up for work at the New Jersey Employment      Security office ... which was where we went next.    </p>    <p>      Now, when you sign up for employment you have to list your      occupation on a card ... and a clerk then has to find the      proper code number to match the occupation you've      indicated. Naturally, I put down "farmer" as my occupation      ... but-and here's catch-22-after searching      through two gigantic code books, the clerk who waited on me      said "There's no code number given for 'farmer'. What else      can you do?" He ended up putting me down as a maintenance      man's helper (or some such). Here I was, a farmer-top      man in the agrarian system-reduced to low man in the      industrial class by some cockamamie law. I couldn't believe      it.    </p>    <p>      But there's more. When I went back to the welfare office,      the clerk there told me: "Sell your cows, and when you've      used that money up, <em>then</em> we can help you."    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, I did a lot of deep thinking at home that      night. More than anything, I was stunned by the sheer irony      of the situation. New Jersey officials are supposedly      "concerned" these days about the state's losing what few      farm families it has left ... yet here I was-a small      farmer being forced out of business, pleading for help-and      no one, from the Governor on down to the lowest welfare      office clerk, seemed to give a damn. "Incredible," I      thought to myself. "Just incredible."    </p>    <h3>A HARD DECISION</h3>        <p>      May 1 finally came. And as I watched the milk tank truck      pull out of my farm for the last time, I saw go with it a      life's work. For I now had no market for my milk, no in      come, no job, no unemployment benefits, no welfare...      nothing, except a six-acre farm, 13 cows, 50 chickens, a      wife, three children, and a dream I'd first dreamed when I      was eleven years old.    </p>    <p>      At this point, I was faced with a hard decision: Should I      buckle under to Big Business and Big Government ... or      should I hold my ground, stand up for my rights, and risk      the consequences?    </p>    <p>      Well, it seemed to me that [1] the creameries had no right      to dictate the size of my farm (which-in      essence-is exactly what they were trying to do), and      [2] the state had no right both to forbid me to sell      uncertified milk to the consuming public AND refuse (simply      because my output was "too small") to even consider      certifying my milk (which was exactly what the Department      of Health had done). I felt fully justified, then, in      taking the only course of action that seemed right to me      ... which was to begin selling my cows'milk on the open      market (that is, direct to consumers).    </p>    <p>      So I began selling 100% natural raw milk on my farm,      and-thanks to word of mouth advertising-I      enjoyed surprisingly brisk business for over a year. One      day, however, the inevitable happened: Department of Health      officials appeared at the door and told me to stop.    </p>    <p>      "What else can I do?" I asked them. "This is the only way I      have to make a living-an honest living-from the land,      raise a family, and pay taxes. I've contacted everyone in      this state from the Governor on down and no one will lift a      finger to help me. This is all I have. I have absolutely no      other choice ... no other way to live."    </p>    <p>      But the officials who visited us were not interested in      hearing about the Kafka situation we were in. They didn't      care. They had a job to do. I was violating a state law.      They had to shut me down.    </p>    <p>      And, of course, there wasn't any way I <em>could</em> shut      down ... not if I wanted to keep feeding my family. So the      officials came back, again and again. And every time they      visited my farm, they cranked the pressure we were living      under up another notch. The whole power of the state of New      Jersey, in short, was increasingly brought to bear on my      little farm. And, finally, I was sued by the state and told      to appear in court.    </p>    <p>      My wife, unable to cope with the strain we were under,      committed suicide. And that left me really alone ... alone      with three children to raise and a whole state treating me      like a common criminal. And all because I was merely trying      to make a small living in the only way I could ... by      selling a natural and unadulterated product to people who      were eager to buy it.    </p>    <h3>LEGAL AID</h3>    <p>      When it'd become evident that the Department of Health was      taking my case seriously, I started to look for legal help.    </p>    <p>      First, I contacted the American Civil Liberties Union ...      and was told I didn't have a chance. Then I went to the      Morris County Legal Aid Society ... but-because I      wasn't a card-carrying welfare recipient-they too      refused to help me. More catch-22's.    </p>    <p>      Finally, some neighbor-friends of mine got in touch with      their lawyer, who in turn recommended that I contact an      attorney by the name of George J. Benson. I went to see      him, and took with me a bagful of letters I'd accumulated      over the past year.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Benson seemed skeptical at first when I told him that      the state intended to sue me ... but when I produced      fistfuls of correspondence (from the Governor's office, the      Secretary of Agriculture, the Medical Milk Commissioner,      the Milk Program Project Coordinator, the Department of      Health, the Welfare Department, and the Employment Security      office), his eyes immediately lit up. I think he knew then      that we had a case.    </p>    <p>      Without further ado, I set about informing the local media      of my situation. And before long, I was <em>swamped</em>      with newspaper reporters. (I hit front page in many papers,      and was even interviewed for an eight-minute spot on a      local TV news program.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, most people thought I was tilting at windmills.      Well-meaning friends and acquaintances told me: "John, you      can't fight government. You're wasting your time and money.      They'll only wear you down." Maybe ... but if you believe      in basic human rights, you stand up for those beliefs just      as Washington, Adams, and others did two centuries ago.      ("Eternal vigilance," as Jefferson-I      believe-said," is the price of liberty.")    </p>    <h3>POSTPONEMENTS</h3>    <p>      For one reason or another, my trial date was postponed      three times (so that instead of going to court in May of      1974, I was to appear-finally-on January      6,1975). And, in between postponements, I wrote many      letters to the editors of New Jersey newspapers. The      following example-dated December 29, 1974-is      representative of the letters I sent, and of my feelings at      the time.    </p>    <p>      <em>To the editor,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>On January 6, 1975, my constitutional right to sell the      organic-product made by the cows on my farm will be      on trial</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I am a small dairy farmer with an increasing market for      my natural milk. The state of New Jersey, however, tells me      that I may only sell my milk to designated buyers: that is,      to the creameries they license to pasteurize milk. These      are the same creameries that laid me off in 1972 on the      grounds that I didn't produce enough milk for them. In      other words, then, the creameries are dictating the size my      herd must be. I contend that they are violating my right to      sell my product on the open market.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I am engaged in the production of food, a lawful      business that all governments recognize. There is no law      stating how large a farm must be in this country, but the      creameries (a part of the private sector) have taken it      upon themselves to try to force me to expand ... even      though my farm is already at the proper size (six acres)      for optimum economic efficiency.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The laws that guarantee the creameries (the processors)      the power to control dairy farmers (the producers) in this      way are overriding the Constitution ... and it this power      is not challenged, the Constitution itself is weakened and      thus in danger of losing its meaning.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I believe I may be the first farmer ever to go on trial      over the right to be a farmer. If the court says that I am      committing a crime against the state by selling natural      milk (for which there is a real demand) to people who want      to buy it, then we have a dictatorship form of government      and NOT the kind of democracy established by our founding      fathers. If the courts dictate who can or cannot be a      farmer, then this is the beginning of the end of our      democracy.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>This is what I am on trial for and fighting to preserve      ... our Constitution, and individual rights.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>John A. Kolezynski</em>    </p>    <h3>MY DAY IN COURT</h3>    <p>      Finally-on January 6, 1975-I went to court to      defend my rights. Also there for the occasion were the      state's Deputy Attorney General in charge of the case,      representatives for the milk industry and the Department of      Health, and my lawyer.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Benson (my attorney) had prepared a good case. He was      ready to argue-among other things-that the      so-called "state law" which forbade me to sell uncertified      milk was, in fact, nothing more than a Department of Health      edict (dating back to 1913) that had never been enacted      into law by the New Jersey legislature. The state, in other      words, had no power to force me (or anyone else) to apply      for certification before selling milk.    </p>    <p>      As it turned out, though, there was no hearing. Mr.      Benson-after meeting in private with representatives      of the state and the dairy industry-returned to his      chair and told me that all charges had been dropped. The      state had agreed (out of court) to allow me to go on      selling raw milk. I had-in effect-"won" the      case.    </p>    <p>      So: Although the Department of Health edict concerning the      certification of milk is still on the books (and will be      until a judge declares it illegal) ... I am now the only      dairy farmer in New Jersey who is allowed to sell natural      (raw) milk.    </p>    <h3>POETIC JUSTICE</h3>    <p>      It's funny: Millions of farmers were forced out of business      in the 50's by the very same "get big or get out" tactics      that the creameries had applied to me in the 70's. But when      they tried to put the squeeze on <em>me</em> , I challenged      the legality of what they were doing ... <em>and won</em> .    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, mine is just an individual case. Since I      settled out of court, the Department of Health's antiquated      and illegal "laws" still stand, and any farmer who wishes      to escape their tyranny must-as I did-wait to be      taken to court, then fight his own battle.    </p>    <p>      I like to think, however, that I've shown that <em>it is      possible</em> to fight such a battle. That-contrary      to what everybody told me, and what everyone seems to      believe these days-you CAN fight city hall. Believe      me, you don't know that you <em>can't</em> until you try.    </p>    <h3>POSTSCRIPT</h3>    <p>      Anyone who wants to is welcome to visit my farm at 153      Zellers Road in Long Valley, New Jersey ... whether to buy      milk or just to talk. (Or to inspect the 200-year-old stone      house I'm presently restoring and-at the same      time-living in.)    </p>    <p>      Most people who come to my place tell me they feel the      "inner peace" and "strength" and "energy" that (apparently)      radiate from me. All I know is, I'm content to live the      lifestyle I've chosen to live ... the way of life that I've      successfully fought to protect.    </p>
