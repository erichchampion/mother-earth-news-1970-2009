            				<h5 id="byline">by RAND B.LEE</h5>          <p>      I'm convinced: Mint has got to be one of the most      <em>versatile</em> herbs around. Indoors, you can use it to      deodorize a room, wake up your skin, freshen your breath,      create delicious hot (and cold) teas, lend zest to      vegetable dishes, and spruce up otherwise-ordinary salads,      juices, spreads, fruits, etc. And outdoors-in the vegetable      garden-mint's highly aromatic foliage acts to repel      ants, white cabbage moths, and other pests ... thereby      ensuring healthy crops of cabbage, tomatoes, broccoli, and      brussels sprouts.    </p>    <p>      No herb or vegetable garden should be without at least      <em>one</em> of the 40 or so sweet-smelling members of the      mint family (genus Mentha). These plants are simply too      useful-and too easy to grow-to pass up!    </p>    <h3>WHERE TO OBTAIN MINT</h3>    <p>      If you live in the country, chances are good that you have      mint on your property already. (if <em>you</em> don't, your      <em>neighbor</em> probably does. Ask for a few plants or      cuttings.)    </p>    <p>      Mint can also be purchased from most any plant shop,      nursery, or mail-order herb outlet. (I've had particularly      good luck with Well-Sweep Herb Farm, 317 Mt. Bethel Rd.,      Port Murray, N.J. 07865. Their service is fast and their      prices-I think-quite reasonable. Send 25 cents      for a catalog.)    </p>    <h3>HOW TO START A MINT BED</h3>    <p>      When transplanting mint, dig the herb up carefully-so      as not to make hash of its roots-and leave a little      soil attached to the plant's base. (You won't have to dig      very deeply, since mint grows close to the surface.)    </p>    <p>      Choose a spot in your garden that's partly shaded and      moderately fertile . . . then put the plants in the ground      about a foot apart, firm the soil around them to its      original level, water thoroughly, and <em>keep</em> the      area moist. (Mints generally prefer damp places and won't      produce strongly scented leaves in dry soil.)    </p>    <p>      Soon, your transplants will begin to send out      runners-or <em>stolons</em> -both under and      over the surface of the ground, much like strawberries. And      before you know it, the empty space between the parent      plants will be filled by dozens of new herblets. (Don't be      afraid to uproot stray stolons if the plants begin to get      out of hand. When I was little, my mother used to yank the      weedlike foliage out of the ground by the handful ... and      the hardy herbs always grew back.)    </p>    <h3>HOW TO GROW CUTTINGS</h3>    <p>      To propagate mints from cuttings, all you have to do is [1]      detach a three-inch-long piece of stem from a parent plant,      [2] remove the leaves from the lowermost inch or so of the      slip, and [3] place the scion in a glass of water on a      window-sill. In about a week-when the cutting's      roots are half an inch long-the young mint will be      ready to go in the ground. (Plant it in the manner      described above, to a depth of 1/2" above the tops of its      roots.)    </p>    <h3>RAISE A BOX OF MINTS</h3>    <p>      Even if you live in an apartment and don't have access to a      plot of fertile ground, you can grow all the mint you'll      ever need ... inside a box. (I've been growing mint this      way since spring of last year, when I moved to sunny Fort      Lauderdale, Florida.)    </p>    <p>      Your box can be any size and shape ... mine consists of      some old boards nailed together haphazardly to make a      container a foot wide, three feet long, and one and a      quarter feet deep (although it really needn't have been      more than six inches deep at the most).    </p>    <p>      On the advice of a nurserywoman, I lined my box with      newspaper to discourage invading insects. (I used only the      black-inked sections, however, since colored ink would-the      woman assured me-poison the soil.)    </p>    <p>      Because I knew (from harsh experience) that my mint planter      would be too heavy to move <em>after</em> it was filled      with soil, I set the empty 1' X 1-1/4' X 3' container in      its permanent location (by my front door, in a spot where      it'd be shaded most of the day) first . . . then I [1]      loaded it with sludge-rich soil, [2] covered the surface of      the dirt with a few handfuls of well-composted cow manure      (which I bought in 50-pound bags at the local nursery), [3]      worked the manure in to a depth of three inches, and [4]      planted a variety of mints: spearmint ( <em>Mentha      spicata</em> ), for its familiar flavor . . . applemint (M.      rotundifolia), for its novel aroma and fuzzy leaves . . .      and perfum mint (M. aquatica), because it sounded exotic.      (I later added a fourth variety: peppermint, M. piperita.)    </p>    <p>      I'm happy to say that all of my mints "took" and-as a      result-began sending stolons out all over the place.      And so far-whether because of the newspaper lining or      the plants' own volatile oils-no bugs have bothered      the containerized garden.    </p>    <h3>TWO WAYS TO HARVEST MINT</h3>    <p>      You can pluck leaves and sprigs directly from the tops of      your plants as you need them ... or you can make a larger      harvest up to three times per year. (In general, a complete      harvest is called for whenever flower stalks begin to      appear on the stems, since mint loses its potency soon      after it blooms.)    </p>    <p>      To make one of the "big" harvests, simply cut off all the      stems and visible stolons at the base of each plant, tie      them together into a bunch, and hang the bundle of foliage      in a dry, shady, well-ventilated place. When the leaves are      dry take them down, and chop'em up if you like, and store      them in airtight containers.    </p>    <h3>A FEW OF THE MANY WAYS TO USE MINT</h3>    <p>      <strong>MINT SPLASH.</strong> Steep a handful of fresh mint      leaves (peppermint is especially good) in a pint of hot      water for about ten minutes ... then strain through a      sieve, let cool, and chill. When you need a lift, sprinkle      yourself with this solution. You'll perk up! (The liquid is      usable for several days.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>MINT RINSE.</strong> Prepare mint-water as above      and add it to your bath water for a tingly wash, or use the      solution as a final rinse after shampooing. It's also good      as a mouthwash, an after-shave lotion, and a soak for tired      feet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BREATH PURIFIER.</strong> Simply chew a sprig of      your favorite mint.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TEA.</strong> Steep 1-1/2 teaspoons of dried (or 3      teaspoons of fresh) chopped mint leaves in a cup of hot      water. Sweeten to taste with honey, then sip slowly,      breathing in the fragrance. (Think of green fields warmed      by the summer sun.) For iced tea, simply serve hot mint tea      "on the rocks".    </p>    <p>      <strong>MINTED VEGETABLES.</strong> During the last two      minutes of cooking, add two tablespoons of fresh chopped      mint (or one tablespoon of dried chopped mint) to each      quart of peas, green beans, carrots, or cauliflower.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ZESTY SALAD.</strong> Toss together two cups of      lettuce, two cups of lamb's-quarters (the herb, not the      animal), two or three scallions (green leaves and all), a      couple of sprigs of fresh marjoram or lemon thyme      (chopped), and three tablespoons of fresh, chopped mint      (more if you want, but be careful not to overpower the      salad with mintiness). Serve with your favorite      oil-and-vinegar dressing. (Yield: 4 servings.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>MINT-CHEESE SPREAD.</strong> Add a few minced mint      leaves to cream or cottage cheese, mix well, and spread on      wholegrain crackers or rounds.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MINTED FRUITS.</strong> Add chopped mint to      applesauce, baked apples, or fruit compotes. (For a morning      eye-opener, blend chopped mint with orange juice.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, you might want to try what I call "mint sniff'.      Bruise a mint leaf, raise it to your nose, and inhale. Do      this whenever you've forgotten the beauty in the world ...      and-believe me-you'll remember.    </p>
