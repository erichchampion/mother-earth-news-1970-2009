                 <p>		 <strong>Bits and Pieces   </strong> </p>            <p>      Swarms of a usually rare, small white butterfly are      gobbling up drug profits in Peru, where illegal coca      growers are battling to save their crops from the insect.      Known locally as <em>malumbia,</em> but otherwise      classified by scientists as <em>Eloria noyesi,</em> the      tiny butterfly eats nothing but coca leaves and this year      has appeared in unprecedented numbers. Many growers have      resorted to spraying their plants with DDT to eradicate the      winged drug buster. Government officials, on the other      hand, are considering raising large numbers of the      butterfly and dropping them over remote growing areas.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Flash Fertility</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although nitrogen accounts for about 78% of our atmosphere,      it isn't available or useful to plants until it's "fixed,"      or combined with other elements to make it biologically      "digestible." Until recently, scientists have believed that      a handful of specialized organisms, among them bacteria on      the roots of such plants as peas and alfalfa, were      primarily responsible for producing fixed nitrogen. Now,      however, a research team has found evidence that suggests      lightning may yield as much as <em>half</em> the fixed      nitrogen in air. Lightning discharges ionize the air,      producing nitrogen oxide, which then reacts with ozone to      produce NO 2 and molecular oxy gen, usable to plants and      animals. Though the process was known previously, it was      thought to be responsible for no more than 3% of      atmospheric fixed nitrogen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Organic Agriculture Hot Line</strong>    </p>    <p>      At least 30,000 of the country's 2.1 million farmers raise      their crops without using toxic herbicides and pesticides,      says the USDA, and this number is increasing rapidly. To      satisfy the burgeoning demand for general and technical      support in sustainable agriculture, USDA has established an      information center, known as ATTRA (Appropriate Technology      Transfer for Rural Areas), and has set up a toll-free      access number: 800/346-9140. ATTRA's staff includes experts      in such fields as agricultural economics and marketing,      soil science and pest control. For more information on      ATTRA, or on virtually any aspect of sustainable      agriculture, call ATTRA at 800/346-9140 any weekday between      8 a.m. and 5 p.m. central time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Forest Arson</strong>    </p>    <p>      In 1987, more than 2 million acres of national forestland      burned, making it the worst year since 1929, according to      the U.S. Forest Service. In the West, drought and lightning      were the primary culprits. But it's a different story in      the Southeast. There, 70% of last year's 15,571 fires      (which destroyed some half-million acres) were attributed      to arson. Forest arson has been particularly widespread in      the South for generations. Investigators say arsonists set      forests ablaze for varying reasons: to get revenge on      someone, to strike a blow at the state or federal      government, to generate excitement      or-ironically-to make money ($3.35 an hour)      fighting fires!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stream Watch</strong>    </p>    <p>      Local and state agencies don't have the money or manpower      to monitor all our nation's streams, so in many cases      critical pollution problems persist unknown to the      authorities that could help solve them. At the same time,      hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts often are the first to      come across such situations-but don't know who to      contact to report a problem. To help bring the two forces      together, The Izaak Walton League has published "A      Citizen's Directory for Water Quality Abuses." The booklet      provides state environmental agency phone numbers for      reporting pollution emergencies and for getting information      about streams and water quality. It also describes how to      recognize different kinds of water pollution and suggests      ways to help on-site. For a copy of the directory, send $1      to The Izaak Walton League of America, 1701 N. Fort Myer      Dr., Arlington, VA 22209.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Potato Self-Defense</strong>    </p>    <p>      Scientists have succeeded in producing a hybrid potato      plant that manufactures its own insect repellent. While      examining the properties of some 1,000 different types of      wild potatoes, a USDA team found that the leaves of one      species-Solanum <em>chacoense-</em> contained      high levels of leptine. This natural toxin deters even the      Colorado potato beetle, this country's leading potato pest.      <em>Chacoense</em> produces only very small tubers, but the      researchers successfully fused cells from the wild species      with those from commercial types and then grew the fused      cells into hybrid plants that produce acceptably large      potatoes (though still only about half the size of market      varieties). Leptine in big doses can be toxic to humans,      but the hybrid plants produce the chemical only in their      leaves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Aerial Abuse</strong>    </p>    <p>      Residents in many rural areas have long complained of      disruptive military training flights over their homes, land      and livestock. To help people direct their complaints to      the proper authorities and to provide citizens with an      effective voice of protest, Citizen Alert and the Rural      Coalition have set up a 24-hour toll-free telephone      reporting service called Skyguard. Skyguard operators will      catalogue complaints, refer callers to legal help and      answer questions about military flight operations. To      report an incident or to request a jet identification and      information brochure, call 800/SKY-GUARD or write Skyguard,      c/o Citizen Alert, P.O. Box 5391, Reno, NV 89513.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Energy Economics</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our national economic competitiveness is largely determined      by how efficiently we use energy, according to a report      issued by the Worldwatch Institute. "If American      industries, buildings and transportation were as energy      efficient as Japan's, the United States could trim $200      billion from its annual fuel bill," say Christopher Flavin      and Alan B. Durning, co-authors of <em>Building on Success:      The Age of Energy Efficiency.</em> "Nations that want to      compete effectively in international markets have no choice      but to raise their energy efficiency to at least the      Japanese level." Most Western industrial nations have      improved their energy efficiency by 15% to 30% since 1973,      saving more energy than they gained from all new sources of      supply. But we still waste enormous quantities. "As much      energy leaks through American windows every year as flows      through the Alaskan pipeline," write the authors. The      report, one of a continuing series of excellent analyses of      globally important issues, is available for $4 postpaid      from the Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Ave.      N.W., Washington, DC 20036.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Home Cool Home</strong>    </p>    <p>      Homeowners looking for ways to beat the heat without      battering their budgets may be interested in either of two      free fact sheets offered by the Conservation and Renewable      Energy Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS). "Passive      Cooling" suggests alternatives to air      conditioning-insulating, shading and other      cost-effective heat stoppers. "Moisture Control In Homes"      discusses the symptoms and solutions to moisture problems,      which in addition to causing mildew and wood rot are often      the culprits behind high utility bills. Ask for either or      both papers by writing CAREIRS, P.O. Box 8900, Silver      Spring, MD 20907 or calling the service's toll-free number:      800/523-2929 (or, from Alaska or Hawaii, 800/233-3071).    </p>
