            		<p>     <strong>To Your Health</strong>    </p>    		<p>      Of grinds, greens and simply going for a stroll.    </p>        <p>      <em>When it concerns the fitness of body, mind or spirit,      the editors of</em> American Health <em>are there, staying      on top of up-to-date medical research, separating fad from      fact and helping you preserve and improve life's most      precious gift-your good health. Here are just a few      items culled from recent and upcoming issues, including      another connection between nutrition and cancer      prevention.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bruxer Busters</strong>    </p>    <p>      Bruxers are people who clench, grind and gnash their teeth,      accelerating tooth wear and frequently giving themselves      broken fillings and headaches. University of Florida      psychologist Jeff Cassisi and other researchers at the      University of Missouri tracked 10 heavy-duty bruxers who      wore nighttime sensors attached to their cheeks for two      weeks. Whenever the sensor detected extreme tension in the      chewing muscle (the masseter), a bedside alarm went off,      which the bruxer had to get up and turn off: As a result,      those bruxers reduced nocturnal gnashing for two weeks      after treatment. Cassisi hopes the alarm can permanently      change behavior, eliminating the need for the traditional      antibruxing plastic mouthpiece.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Folic Acid/B 12 Connection</strong>    </p>    <p>      Beta-carotene has gotten a lot of press as a cancer      preventive, but another healthboosting ingredient of leafy      green vegetables is folic acid.    </p>    <p>      A 1985 USDA survey found that the diets of women average      only 51% of the RDA for folic acid, of men 76%.      Furthermore, studies have found that smokers with injured      lung cells have particularly low levels of both folic acid      and B 12 . These deficiencies may lead to DNA mutations,      making lung cells even more susceptible to such carcinogens      as cigarette smoke.    </p>    <p>      More recently, nutrition scientist Douglas Heimburger,      M.D., and colleagues at the University of Alabama Medical      Center in Birmingham studied 73 male heavy smokers with      potentially precancerous lung cells. Half the group      received daily doses of 10 mg folic acid (25 times the U.S.      RDA) and 500 mcg B 12 (83 times), and the other half were      given placebos. At four months, six of the 37 <em>untreated      controls</em> spontaneously showed reduced lung-cell      injury, but two-and-a-half times <em>more</em> of the      treated men-14 of 36-had reduced injury.    </p>    <p>      Heimburger cautions that though the results are      encouraging, smokers shouldn't use supplements as an excuse      not to quit. "The benefits of quitting smoking <em>far</em>      outweigh those of dietary changes," he stresses.    </p>    <p>      Folic acid also protects against birth defects, and another      Alabama study found that 22 women with cervical dysplasia      (potentially premalignant cells) improved when treated with      folic acid alone, while a control group stayed the same or      worsened.    </p>    <p>      The best natural sources of this helpful vitamin are      dark-green leafy vegetables such as spinach and romaine      lettuce, as well as broccoli, oranges and liver.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Take a Walk</strong>    </p>    <p>      It's long been doctrine that you have to exercise hard 20      to 60 minutes a day, three to five times a week, to reap      many health benefits. Living up to that standard is so      intimidating that a lot of people don't even try. Among      those who agree to start an exercise program, half don't      make it past six months. (Studies show that 25% of these      dropouts don't even appear for their first session! )    </p>    <p>      But workouts don't have to be difficult to be healthful.      Dr. James M. Rippe, cardiologist and a leading physiology      researcher at the University of Massachusetts medical      school, recently reported on some significant research      breakthroughs. He's found that you can reap      <em>immediate</em> benefits from less exercise than was      previously believed.    </p>    <p>      For example, mild exercise-such as walking-can      reduce tension, anxiety and blood pressure on the first      day, <em>and,</em> over a moderate distance (about three      miles), you get about the same relaxing benefits whether      your walking speed is fast, medium or slow.    </p>    <p>      Additionally, in a 12-week study Rippe conducted with 23      women of average fitness, as little as 12 minutes of      stationary cycling done three times a week produced a      significant improvement in maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2      max), the measure of aerobic conditioning. In fact, a 50%      boost in VO 2 max occurred within two weeks. The results      suggest that average women-and probably men, as      well-can develop a healthier heart and body without      sweaty efforts.    </p>
