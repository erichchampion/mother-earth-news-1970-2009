                    <p>		  Protect summer crops from scorching sun and scavenging      songbirds.</p>			<h5 id="byline">      By Susan Sides    </h5>        <p>      Once upon a time, an acorn plunked Chicken Little on the      head, convincing the skittish hen that the entire sky was      falling. As a gardener, I can empathize with that feathered      paranoiac. When a hot July sun shrivels up tender greens or      flying thieves ransack the fruits I nursed from seedhood,      I, too, feel like the sky may be tumbling down upon all my      gardening efforts. Our fabled chicken covered her head with      tiny wings. Fortunately, we can use better      shields-shade and bird nettings. They are, indeed,      wonderful panaceas for two of summer's most common      gardening headaches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Shade Netting</strong>    </p>    <p>      I understand the reluctance of most growers to      intentionally exclude sunlight with a shade      netting-we've all read over and over how important it      is for crops to get enough sun. But there are times when      parts of any garden, except in areas with the coolest      summers, could benefit from a bit of extra shade.    </p>    <p>      Consider some examples. Perhaps you've dreamed of a      picture-book fall garden, but were brought back to reality      when sunburned broccoli seedlings gave up the ghost. Maybe      you've wished you could still enjoy fresh lettuce when the      tomatoes ripen in July. Or you might wonder what to do      about an August carrot sowing that never sprouted due to      lack of moisture and drying winds.    </p>        <p>      Let shade cloth come to the rescue.    </p>    <p>      Inventive gardeners have made shade for years using window      screening, onion bags, snow fencing and taller plants, but      now the highly effective nettings that have long been in      commercial use are available for home growers, as well.      Woven from polypropylene or saran, this black, green or      clear material buffers the brunt of the sun's rays and      helps cool the air (much as window screens do in your      home). As a bonus, shade cloth also slows the force of      drying winds.    </p>    <p>      Fifty percent shade netting cuts the sun's intensity by      half and has a multitude of uses. You can set it over newly      set-out transplants to slow photosynthesis for a few days.      This will put less of a strain on roots which have enough      to do settling into a new home without supporting a burst      of new growth. Used over direct-sown seeds, shade cloth      helps keep the soil moist (even 1/2 inch of dry soil can      mean death to newly germinated plants) and slows the rate      of transpiration (water loss) from those tiny new leaves.      Some gardeners lay boards or fabrics such as burlap on top      of newly sown rows for this same purpose, but that practice      may promote disease, encourage slugs and actually wick      moisture from the ground. And while it's true that solid      cloth suspended <em>above</em> seedbeds won't cause those      problems, you'd have to remove that light blocker just as      soon as the plants germinate.    </p>    <p>      You can also try using 50% shade cloth to persuade      quick-bolting plants like lettuce and spinach to keep      growing into the summer, but 10% to 30% netting works      better for this purpose. The more open material allows      enough sunlight to penetrate so that the plants don't      easily become leggy. Even so, you'll want to pull the cover      over your crops only during the hottest hours, say from 10      o'clock in the morning until four or five in the afternoon.      One drawback: The lower percentage netting is harder to      locate.    </p>    <p>      In what seems like a contradiction in terms, shade cloth      can also help protect from frost. On a tip from David Duhon      (author of <em>One Circle: How to Grow a Complete Diet in      Less Than 1,000 Square Feet),</em> we tried laying 50%      shade cloth right on top of last fall's lettuce on cold      nights. Sure enough, that frost shield enabled us to hold      onto our salad bed until December.    </p>    <p>      Although mature plants (like our fall lettuce) may be stout      enough to support a shade cloth, most often you'll need to      suspend it above your plants. Roll it out over arched      sections of PVC pipe, a wooden frame, or stakes that have      been placed throughout the bed and along the sides. You can      water shaded plants less often than normal, but when you      do, first pull the netting back. Watering through shade      cloth is uneven at best and downright damaging at      worst-drip lines concentrate run-off at certain      spots. And watch your step: The stuff is notoriously slick      when folded onto itself.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bird Netting</strong>    </p>    <p>      Bird netting doesn't aid the growth of better fruits and      berries, but it does help you <em>keep</em> the ones you      produce. Think of it as flexible fencing. Unlike crawling      insects or raiding mammals, birds can zero in on their      target from any angle, making a wraparound barrier your      most reliable defense.    </p>    <p>      This woven polypropylene fabric (also called protective      net) has larger holes than those in shade cloth and lasts      from five to 10 years. (Those with ultraviolet inhibitors      have the longest life expectancies.)    </p>    <p>      Used correctly, bird netting is extremely effective. Used      incorrectly, it's simply a waste of time. As far as tree      fruit goes, the biggest mistake (perpetuated by drawings in      some of the catalogues that sell the stuff) is draping the      fabric over the tree and letting it hang down the sides      like a bedspread. Even a bird's brain can figure out the      answer to that one: Fly up from underneath, sit in the      branches, and begin dining. So gather and tie the extra      material around the trunk like the wrapper on a candied      apple.    </p>    <p>      When protecting small berries (or even let tuce and      tomatoes), avoid draping the netting directly over the      plants. Instead, place it on some sort of frame that keeps      it off the plants. Birds have trouble landing in netted      trees, but they can stand right next to a row of netted      strawberries and peck out the morsels, or they can perch on      stakes, branches and nearby bushes to attack covered      blueberries.    </p>    <p>      There's no reason, then, to let scorching sunlight or      hungry birds give you a Chicken Little complex ("The crops      are failing! The crops are failing!"). You don't have to      panic and throw up your hands. Instead, throw up some nets!    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      A FEW SOURCES OF FINE FABRIC</h2>    <p>      Bountiful Gardens    </p>    <p>      5798 Ridgewood Rd., Willits, CA 95490; 707/459-3390.<br />      30% shade cloth, 8' wide, $2 per running foot. 50% shade      cloth, 6' wide, $1.50 per running foot. 6' X 25' 1 "-mesh      bird netting, $9, 25' X 25' 7/8" mesh bird netting, $32.
