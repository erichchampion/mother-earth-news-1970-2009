            <p><strong>Earth Diary</strong></p>    		<h5 id="byline">      By Tom Turner    </h5>    		<p>      The Pacific Northwest always seems to have noisy      environmental disputes under way-in state      legislatures, in the newspapers, in the courts, in better      saloons and taverns everywhere. A perennial topic is      forestry, and mid-1988 is no exception.    </p>    <p>      Much of the region has been heavily logged, to the point      that a flight over western Oregon, for example, reveals a      landscape that looks the way I did when, at the age of six,      my best friend offered to give me a free haircut. Large      patches have been skinned to reveal lumpy ground, devoid of      most everything but a few weeds. Regeneration of the trees      is painfully slow.    </p>        <p>      Environmentalists have struggled long and hard to find a      way to slow the clear-cut express. They have succeeded in      helping establish four national parks and several      wilderness areas in the 19 national forests in Oregon and      Washington. Still, the felling of      forests-particularly the valuable old-growth forests      where a single tree can provide $2,000 worth of      lumber-continues apace, even though perhaps only 10%      of the region's original stock of old growth remains.    </p>    <p>      In recent years, a new player has emerged on the field of      debate, the northern spotted owl, considered by biologists      a reliable indicator of the health of old-growth forests in      general. The owl requires old-growth forests to survive,      for reasons that are not terribly well understood. What is      well understood is that as the forests have been leveled,      the population of spotted owls has crashed-to the      point where it is threatened with extinction, in the      considered opinion of every expert in the field.    </p>    <p>      Despite this fact, pleas to add the owl to the list of      threatened and endangered species have fallen on deaf ears,      undoubtedly because of the economic and political power of      the timber industry in the region. Having nowhere else to      turn, conservation groups have recently turned, once again,      to the courts.    </p>    <p>      Lawyers for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a      lawsuit in early May against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife      Service. The suit asks the court to order the federal      agency to add the northern spotted owl to the list of      threate ned and endangered species. The case set off storms      of controversy.    </p>    <p>      Admittedly, the lawsuit is a drastic step,      and-assuming it succeeds, which it may or may      not-it may, indeed, impose short-term economic      hardships on some elements of the timber industry. The      organizations that brought the suit-including the      Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, the Oregon Natural      Resources Council, Headwaters and many Audubon Society      chapters in Oregon and Washington-understand this all      too well.    </p>    <p>      They are not, however-as charged by industry      spokespersons-a bunch of hardhearted zealots who love      birds more than people. Rather, they're like the Audubon      Society official who once was asked if he liked birds or      people better. "I like people who like birds," he answered.    </p>    <p>      In addition, they're people who clearly understand the      following:    </p>    <p>      The spotted owl population in the Northwest has crashed      dramatically and alarmingly in the past few decades, and if      drastic steps aren't taken quickly, it may be too late to      save the species. (In denying the groups' petition to      "list" the species, the FWS relied on a study by a single      scientist who later accused the agency of misrepresenting      his work.)    </p>    <p>      Spotted owls depend on old-growth forests to survive.      Industry, in its wisdom, has eliminated virtually every      acre of old growth on private land in the Northwest. That      means that essentially all the habitat suitable for spotted      owls is on federal land.    </p>    <p>      Decisions on whether to add species to the endangered      species list are required by law to be based strictly on      biological science-not economics, not politics, not      whether a species is cute or cuddly. Fish and Wildlife      Service officials have acknowledged, however, that politics      and economics played a considerable role in their decision.      If that's true, it's illegal.    </p>    <p>      The timber industry in the Pacific Northwest has begun to      adjust to the post-old-growth era already, and it will have      to complete that transition expeditiously whether or not it      is allowed to mow down the last of the old growth and the      owls and other creatures with it. That means retooling      equipment in sawmills so they can handle smaller logs      efficiently. It means altering equipment used in the field      to handle the smaller, second-growth trees. It means, in      essence, putting the idea of cutting down thousand-year-old      trees out of mind, forever.    </p>        <p>      To repeat, this will happen soon anyway. If there were no      lawsuit, if there were no protestors installing themselves      in the tops of old trees in a desperate attempt to save      them, if there were no resistance whatever to logging old      growth, industry could keep cutting for only a handful of      years at most.    </p>    <p>      And when time ran out, except for the remnants now      protected in wilderness areas and national parks, the trees      would be gone, the owls would be gone, and the loggers and      the mills would be facing exactly the same situation they      will face if the suit succeeds.    </p>    <p>      The difference is that if the lawsuit succeeds, there will      be a small but respectable amount of primeval forest,      complete with spotted owls and a hundred other creatures,      to proudly show to our children and grandchildren. We'll be      able to tell them we took the painful but necessary steps,      and we took them in time.    </p>    <p>      Tom Turner, a writer and editor with 20 years' experience      in the environmental field, is staff writer for the Sierra      Club Legal Defense Fund, an independent environmental law      firm that represents many organizations across the country.
