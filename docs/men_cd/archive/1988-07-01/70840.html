                <p>      <strong>Seasons of the Garden</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Help your yard kick that water-guzzling      habit.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>        <p>      Summer heat and dry weather often add up to low water      supplies. You may have already done a lot to minimize      outdoor water use by mulching your flower and vegetable      beds and installing drip irrigation around your shrubs and      tree crops. But are you doing anything for your grassed      areas? Lawns are frequently the biggest water guzzlers in      home landscapes. Proper care can make a difference in how      much water you need to keep grass green and healthy.      Here're a few guidelines:    </p>    <p>      Frequent low mowing creates a dense grass canopy. Since      little air flows around such short-cropped leaves, little      water gets "wicked away" by wind. However, high-mowed grass      has more extensive roots than low-cut blades, so it      withstands drought better. Thus, a low-mowed lawn may use      less water over a season than a high-mowed one, but it      needs it more often. Lawn-care experts suggest a      compromise: Mow the grass fre quently at a <em>moderate      height</em> .    </p>    <p>      Don't overfertilize with nitrogen, or the leaves will grow      too quickly and use more water. Too much N also restricts      root development, further increasing watering needs. On the      other hand, adding extra potassium and iron may enhance      root growth and improve drought tolerance. In fact, adding      iron can make a low-N lawn look as green as a high-N one.    </p>    <p>      Last, if you're starting a new lawn, check with your local      garden supply store or extension agent. Several new grass      cultivars have lower water needs than most common      varieties.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Research Briefs</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Low-nitrate carrots.</strong> Russian trials show      that carrots grown in high-nitrogen soil have high      concentrations of nitrates (which are potential      carcinogens)-unless the soil is also high in      phosphorus and potassium. So for your and your carrots'      best health, give them a balanced (fertilizer) diet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grow up.</strong> MOTHER-reader Woodie Owen      recently saw the University of Mexico's new idea for      helping people with little land grow crops: large      crop-growing tubes. Each six-foot-high and -round cylinder      is made from heavy plastic sheeting and filled with soil.      Then holes are cut out of the sides and transplants set in.      Seven of these wood-braced tubes fit under one hexagonal      plastic roof.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Preventing beetles</strong> . . . University of      Kentucky entomologists found that just the scent of a few      Japanese beetles feeding on a plant can attract more of the      pests. So handpick the advance guard (in the morning, when      the beetles are sluggish), shake those first comers off, or      shield your plants with a floating row cover such as      Reemay.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dollar signs of the times.</strong> The new Boy      Scout Agribusiness merit badge replaces the Food Systems      and the Farm and Ranch Management badges. The patch's logo?      A computer flanked by dollar signs! (A barn and gear appear      in the background.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Birds away!</strong> Japanese farmers reportedly      use large balloons painted with several black-and-red bulls      eyes to protect <em>millions of</em> acres <em>of</em>      rice. North American trials show that six "Scare-Eye"-      balloons per acre help protect cherries, blueberries,      strawberries and corn from flocking birds like starlings,      grackles, crows and pigeons. Scare-Eyes are available from      Hartmann's Plantation, Inc., 310 60th St., P.O. Box E,      Grand Junction, MI 49056.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gleanings</strong>    </p>    <p>      Michael Maltas's 30-page <em>Orchard Pest Management and      Spray Schedule: Biodynamic, Organic, and Limited Synthetics      Options</em> ($6.60 postpaid from Ames Orchard &      Nursery, 6 E. Elm, Fayetteville, AR 72701) is must reading      for orchardists who want to avoid synthetic pesticides . .      . . Recipes in <em>The New York Botanical Garden      Cookbook</em> ($11.50 postpaid from New York Botanical      Garden, Attn. Gift Shop, Bronx, NY 10458) emphasize fresh      vegetables, fruits and herbs. The book is a welcome      addition when everything is ripening at once . . . . If      you're thinking about getting into the booming business      <em>of</em> commercial herb production, first read the free      USDA leaflet, "A Small-Scale Agricultural Alternative:      Herbs" (Office for Small-Scale Agriculture, Cooperative      State Research Service/Office <em>of</em> Grants and      Program Systems, Room 6345, Hamilton Bldg., USDA,      Washington, DC 20250 . . . . The nonprofit Vinifera Wine      Growers Association provides free phone advice (call      703/754-8564) to back-yard and commercial growers      <em>of</em> European wine grape cultivars. A one-year      membership, which also includes a subscription to a      quarterly <em>journal,</em> costs $17 from VWGA, Box P, The      Plains, VA 22171.    </p>    <p>      Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their food on a small      farm and publish HortIdeas, a fine newsletter on gardening      research and products ($15 a year from G. & P.
