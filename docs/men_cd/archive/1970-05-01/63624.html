                    <h5 id="byline">by TOM McNAMARA:</h5>    <p>      Why even try to survive in the city? Everybody knows the      green fields of Nature is where it's at. So why stick it      out where the air is sooty, the noise clattering and      there's a distinct possibility of getting robbed, arrested      or worse?    </p>    <p>      Because it's exciting, for one reason. Because you have      friends not yet as free (even) as you. Because, if you know      how, you can live very well for very little in the biggest      and best of the world's cities. And because there's nothing      to keep you from having both a city and a country home.    </p>    <p>      Maybe you'll think I'm lucky. I've got a small, quiet      penthouse-like apartment on New York's Lower Eastside (also      erroneously referred to as "the East Village").    </p>    <p>      My pad has a roof to sit on, a courtyard kept breakfast      plate-clean by our hardworking superintendent and all the      necessities: Stove, refrigerator, etc. Everything but      utilities are covered by a monthly rent of only $50. The      three good-sized rooms are in a small rear building - like      a carriagehouse - so I don't even hear most traffic except      for the music of an occasional horntoot.    </p>    <p>      Before I moved in, I invested a few hundred in      improvements: Burlapped walls, acoustic-tiled ceilings,      wood louver shades and interior doors, a paint job and      pull-chain Japanese lights with big globes (a big mistake,      they're too fragile and expensive). Even put in a dimmer      switch to rest these tired-of-typing eyes and hired some      local guys to do the work.    </p>    <p>      My friends were amazed. "You mean you're spending $1200 to      fix up your apartment?"    </p>    <p>      "Sure," I said, "other people spend $40,000 on a house and      work forever to pay for it. Why shouldn't I spend $1200 on      a place I expect to live in at least two years?"    </p>    <p>      Well, I've spent almost five happy creative      poetry-producing years here now and I couldn't be happier.    </p>    <p>      But what about you . . . especially if you're coming into      town for the first time and you're coming in broke?    </p>    <p>      OK. Arriving in the city without money is not a good idea      and I don't recommend it. But it is possible to arrive with      very little and to survive, especially in the towns (San      Francisco, Atlanta, Austin, etc.) that have somewhat      organized hip communities.    </p>    <p>      The key to the help you can get on arrival is the      underground paper in each city. Most services center around      the hipper churches, some of which provide temporary food      and shelter, referral services, temporary jobs, medical      services, etc.    </p>    <p>      If you've got enough bread to carry you for a few days,      your first order of business will be to, as they say in New      York, "get located".    </p>    <p>      New York is great. It's got strong rent control laws      (unlike other big cities) but rents in the East Village -      still the best cheap place to live - are going up anyway.      Presently, there is a general apartment shortage in town as      landlords withhold empty places in an effort to force      raises through the city council. (Can't happen. Everyone      knows there would be riots.)    </p>    <p>      It is common to have to deal through an agent (the fee is      set by law at one month's rent) or to have to pay "key      money" to a tenant in order to get a good apartment.      Particularly if the apartment is low-rent and most      especially if the tenant has improved the place. Under the      law, key money is illegal and it is important that you get      a signed lease before paying it.    </p>    <p>      Ads that say "furniture available" mean the apartment will      be sold to the highest bidder. Sums of hundreds of dollars      are not unusual in these transactions. The best deal,      particularly if you have little money, is to get the      cheapest good place you can find and fix it up.    </p>    <p>      As soon as you move into your good, cheap place, spend a      few dollars improving its security or you're liable to find      everything you own stolen the first time you're out. If      it's any consolation, the rate of violent crime is lower on      the Lower East Side than elsewhere in the city but - Oh,      those second story men!    </p>    <p>      Once you have your lease file an application with the      City's Department of Buildings to make sure the correct      rent is charged. Don't let the weird New York rent rates      confuse you, either. Controlled rents almost always end in      an odd number since increases are pegged at 15% every two      years unless the tenant remains. Obviously, under this      system, a tenant who stays put enjoys relatively less and      less costly rentals as the years roll on.    </p>    <p>      Report all violations (substandard conditions in your      apartment or building) to the Buildings Department unless      the landlord not only promises to have them repaired, but      does so immediately. The City, slow as it works, will      require the landlord to comply with regulations.    </p>    <p>      By the way, living in the slums of the Lower East Side can      be a real trip if you've ever dreamed of going to Spain or      Puerto Rico. When I moved into my place, I used to be      awakened every morning (about 11 a.m.) by the trilling of a      canary one of my Spanish-speaking neighbors down the      courtyard kept. As the years passed, it was the melancholy      voices of housewives singing in a manner reminiscent of the      Portuguese <em>fado</em> that woke me. For a short time it      was the exceptional singing of a man (who turned out to be      a professional performer in Spanish stage shows) serenading      his children on the fire escape near my window.    </p>    <p>      The Puerto Rican people are very friendly and optimistic in      spite of their poor lives and they are excellent neighbors.      Anyone moving into the area should be prepared to learn a      few words in Spanish to get to know them.    </p>    <p>      Once you're located in an inexpensive apartment, you'll      find many other ways to live on little in New York City.      The local supermarkets have special bins of damaged cans      (be careful, don't buy cans which are rusted or unsealed or      which have bulgy tops).    </p>    <p>      Search out the day-old bread stores (there's one on 9th St.      near 1st Ave.) They have excellent buys on broken, quality      cookies and good pastry.    </p>    <p>      If you smoke, roll your own cigarettes. The Tobacco Center      on St. Mark's Place near Tompkins Park has inexpensive      rollers and a large selection of good tobaccos.    </p>    <p>      Walk as much as possible (transportation fares are up and      the exercise is good for you and, anyway, where have you      got to go once you've seen uptown a few times?)    </p>    <p>      Fix up your apartment and cook and entertain at home.    </p>    <p>      Forget about the expensive commercial entertainment spots      and "first run" movies. This may sound hard to believe, but      I save a lot of money because, after years of seeing all      the great films, I don't need to go much anymore. By      "great" I mean the movie classics that are always so      available in a city like New York. That's the main reason      for living here, of course: The great diversity of things      to see and do; the exposure to the smorgasbord of our      culture.    </p>    <p>      This exposure doesn't take much money. The museums are      free. The libraries are free. There are plenty of places to      meet fellow artists-to-be that are free or inexpensive.    </p>    <p>      New York probably has more museums than any other city and      many of them are free. The Metropolitan, alone, is so big      you'll need a year to see it all. And there's the Museum of      Natural History where Murph the Surf and friends picked up      a.diamond bigger than the Ritz. Or how about the Morgan      library of famous manuscripts? There's uncounted other      collections of exciting things around town.    </p>    <p>      The Main Library on 42nd Street has plenty of good branches      within easy walking distance of the East Village. They're      all free. If the branch you're visiting doesn't have the      book you want, the librarian can use the central locator to      find it for you. You can then pick it up or, for a few       cents, have it delivered to your branch on the next truck.    </p>    <p>      There are still good coffeehouses where a night of talk,      chess, sharing dreams and creative arguing can cost you 25       cents or less. The <em>De je vu,</em> on East 10th Street      between Avenues A and B, is one and it stays open all      night.    </p>    <p>      The zoo in Central Park is free and the big one in the      Bronx is free on certain days.    </p>    <p>      Cooper Union, a college on the gateway to the East Side,      has lectures, dance programs, concerts and other activities      three nights a week during the winter. All free.    </p>    <p>      The now-famous avant-garde <em>La Mama,</em> just one of      the newer off-off-broadway showcases for talent, puts on a      new play every week. The Judson Church in the West Village      and St. Marks on the East Side also present such offerings.      All for contributions, but reservations may be necessary.    </p>    <p>      The YMCA shows great movie classics for about $1.00.    </p>    <p>      Poetry readings are held somewhere every night of the week,      usually for whatever you can contribute.    </p>    <p>      If you need any more ideas, the <em>Village Voice</em>      lists a whole page every week and hardly anything-concerts,      recitals, lectures, poetry readings, dance groups,      discussions-costs more than a dollar. If all else fails,      the Staten Island Ferry is still only a nickel and      peoplewatching on 5th Avenue or St. Marks Place is free!    </p>    <p>      Now that your basic living and entertainment expenses are      pared down, you may not care to work full-time. Is it      possible to find part-time employment in New York? Easiest      thing in the world! Even if you have "no skills" at all.    </p>    <p>      New York is swarming with temporary help agencies that      always need typists and file clerks. If you can't type,      tell `em you have experience filing. After all, any idiot -      even me - can file stuff. Experience!??    </p>    <p>      Friends of mine pick up bigger chunks of money in less time      by working on non-union piers unloading ships. For these      jobs, though, you've got to be strong and know your way      around.    </p>    <p>      You can also make good money with little effort and time as      a nude model if you're well-endowed physically. The      underground papers are full of ads for both guys and gals      in this category. Seems amazing there should be so many      painters and photographers these days ... but who am I to      ask questions?    </p>    <p>      If worse comes to worse and you absolutely can't find a job      anywhere, it is still possible to get on the welfare rolls      in New York and other cities although the latest reports      from the west coast indicate a general clamp-down and      pruning of welfare out that way.    </p>    <p>      Actually, you should feel no guilt about accepting welfare,      especially if you're a creative person using the money to      survive as you learn your art in order to make a greater      contribution to Society later. I tell young people that      welfare is their own Guggenheim Grant (since the real      Guggenheims go only to the well known and connected . . .      people who don't need them anyway).    </p>    <p>      It's really a shame that more creative people don't take      advantage of welfare funds and free food rather than get      ground to gristle in the corporate monsters. We think      nothing of allowing our government to grant billions of      dollars to a corporation in subsidies and grants for the      development of another overkill war machine . . . yet      consider it almost a crime for the same government to      guarantee a minimum existence to a single citizen while he      develops his human potential - an infinitely more valuable      commodity.    </p>    <p>      Getting on welfare is easy if you've ever been in a mental      hospital . . . or you can simply say that your parents      won't help you and you desperately need funds. Talk to the      Welfare Rights people or people of your age who are      receiving checks and they'll help you. Many workers in the      Welfare Department are quite sympathetic to young artists      (even so-called "hippies"). A friend of mine who is a      welfare investigator once said to me, "I am beginning to      realize the only thing that separates me from my clients is      my title." Unfortunately.    </p>    <p>      Just a few years ago I really hit bottom. I was broke and      starving. I was too disgusted with "the system" and too      depressed to get a job. I could have gotten welfare easily      but I didn't know that.    </p>    <p>      I survived that bleak period - and survived fairly well -      by cutting my expenses to the bone, rolling my own      cigarettes and scrambling for corn the markets threw away.      And never did corn taste more succulent! There is great      strength to be gained by overcoming such adversity and not      "copping out".    </p>    <p>      Those lean days are now past for me. On about $150 a month,      I live very well in high Bohemian (a Bohemian is somebody      who gives up the "necessities" - on occasion - to afford      the "luxuries" . . . like Life, Liberty and the Pursuit and      Conquest of Happiness) fashion.    </p>    <p>      What I am saying is that it is possible to live freely and      very comfortably in the city. City living has many      advantages over the country: The great diversity of things      to do; intellectual stimulation counterbalanced by      opportunity for solitude; the freedom that city life's      anonymity offers; the sense of privacy and toleration of      differences which - while far from Utopia - is considerably      more advanced than you'll find in the American small town      of my acquaintance.    </p>    <p>      <em>I realize that I've just scratched the<br />      surface with this article and that you<br />      may have further questions. If so, I'll<br />      be happy to answer them to the best<br />      of my ability (I enjoy corresponding).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Just write to me at 258 East 4 St.,<br />      New York, N.Y. 10009.

But I don't think I'll ever quit the city      entirely. Not unless things get much worse than they are      now. For me, survival in the city is definitely worth the      effort!<br />    </p>    <p>      <br />      GEORGE METESKY wrote the following three or four years ago      and he says it's all FREE of copyright and may be reprinted      by anyone at any time. So be it.    </p>    <p>      FREE is specific to New York City andmore specifically - to      the New York City of three or four years ago. But it's      techniques may easily be adapted to any large city at any      time.<br />      <br />      <strong>FREE</strong>    </p>    <p>      FREE VEGETABLES Hunt's Point Market, Hunt's Point Avenue      and 138th Street. Have to go by car or truck between 6-9      A.M. but well worth it. You can get enough vegetables to      last your commune a week. Lettuce, squash, carrots,      cantaloupe, grapefruit, melons, even artichokes and      mushrooms. Just tell them you want to feed some people free      and it's yours. All crated and everything. Hunt's Point is      the free people's heaven.<br />      <br />      FREE MEAT AND POULTRY The closest slaughterhouse area is in      the far West Village, west of Hudson Street and south of      14th Street. Get a letter from Rev. Allen of St. Mark's on      the Bowerie, Second Avenue and 10th Street, saying you need      some meat for a church sponsored meal. Bring a car or      truck. There is some law that if the meat touches the      ground or floor they have to give it away. So if you know      how to trip a meat truck, by all means.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      FREE FRESH FISH The Fish Market is located on Fulton Street      and South Street under the East River Drive overpass. You      have to get there between 6-9 A.M. but it is well worth it.      The fishermen always have hundreds of pounds of fish that      they have to throw away if they don't sell. Mackerel,      halibut, cod, catfish, and more. You can have as much as      you can cart away.    </p>    <p>      FREE BREAD AND ROLLS Rapaports on Second Avenue between 5th      and 6th streets will give you all the free bread and rolls      you can carry. You have to get there by 7 A.M. in order to      get the stuff. It's a day old, but still very good. If you      want them absolutely fresh, put them in an oven to which      you have added a pan of water (to avoid drying them out),      and warm them for a few minutes. Most bakeries will give      you day old stuff if you give them a half-way decent sob      story. A&P stores clean their vegetable bins every day      at 9 A.M. They always throw out cartons of very good      vegetables. Tell them you want to feed your rabbits.    </p>    <p>      FREE COOKING LESSONS <em>(plus you</em> <em>get to eat the      meal)</em> are sponsored by the New York Department of      Markets, 137 Centre Street, Thursday mornings. Call CA      65653 for more information.    </p>    <p>      CATERING SERVICES Check the Yellow Pages. You can visit      them on a Saturday, Sunday afternoon or Monday morning.      They always have stuff left over. Invest 10  cents in one of      the Jewish Dailies and check out the addresses of the local      synagogues and their schedule of bar mitzvahs, weddings,      and testimonial dinners. Show up at the back of the place      about three hours after it is scheduled to start. There is      always left-over food. If you want the food served to you      out front you naturally have to disguise yourself to look      straight. Remarks such as "I'm Marvin's brother" or "Gee,      Dorothy looks marvelous" are great. Lines like "Betty      doesn't look pregnant" are frowned upon.    </p>    <p>      Large East Side bars are fantastically easy touches. The      best time is 5 P.M. Take a half-empty glass of booze from      an empty table and use it as a prop. Just walk around      sampling the hors d'oeuvres. Once you find your favorite,      stick to it. You can soon become a regular. They won't mind      your loading up on free food because they consider you one      of the crowd. Little do they realize that you are a super      freeloader. All Longchamps are good. Max's Kansas City at      Park Avenue South and 16th Street doesn't even mind it if      you freeload when you are hungry and an advantage here is      that you can wear any kind of clothes. Max features fried      chicken wings, swedish meatballs and ravioli.    </p>    <p>      THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS is      located at 26 Second Avenue. Every morning at 7 A.M. a      delicious cereal breakfast is served free along with      chanting and dancing. Also 12 Noon more food and chanting      and on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 7 P.M. again food      and chanting. Then it's all day Sunday in Central Park      Sheepmeadow (generally) for still more chanting (sans      food). Hari Krishna is the freest high going if you can get      into it and dig cereal and, of course, more chanting.    </p>    <p>      FREE TEA AND COOKIES In a very nice setting at the Tea      Center, 16 East 56th Street. 10-11 A.M. and 2-4 P.M. Monday      to Friday.    </p>    <p>      THE CATHOLIC WORKER, 181 Chrystie Street, will feed you any      time but you have to pray as you do in the various      Salvation Army stations. Heavy wino scene is the Men's      Temporary Shelter on 8 East 3rd Street. You can get free      room and/or meals here if you are over 21 but it's worse      than jail or Bellevue. It is a definite last resort only.      The freest meal of all is Tuesdays at 5 P.M. inside or in      front of St. Mark's Church on the Bowerie, Second Avenue at      10th Street. A few yippie-diggers serve up a meal ranging      from Lion Meat to Guppy Chowder to Cantaloupe Salad. They      are currently looking for a free truck to help them collect      the food and free souls dedicated to extending the free      food concept.    </p>    <p>      LIBERATION NEWS SERVICE At 3064 Broadway and 121st Street      will give you up-to-the-minute coverage of movement news      both national and local, as well as a more accurate picture      of what's going on.
