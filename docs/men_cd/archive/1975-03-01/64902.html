                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Indoor Planting Method    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by Douglas C. Grant    </h5>    <p>      Growing plants indoors can be a pain but not at my house,      now that a few suggestions passed on to me by a      professional have taken a lot of the worry and work out of      this project. As a result, I grow lettuce all winter and do      nothing more than plant and harvest. No watering, no daily      inspection of soil, no anything except fresh greens when      others are picking over the tired grocery variety. In the      spring, my mini garden is converted to a plant starter for      the outdoor patch. Once again, the Sow and Forget Method      makes the job easy and trouble-free, with fantastic      results.    </p>    <p>      The basic tool behind the Sow and Forget Method is a supply      of wicking. This isn't easy to find, but is certainly worth      looking for and lasts for years once you have it.    </p>        <p>      The wicking I use looks like ordinary sash rope but is made      of fiberglass. (There may be other types I'm not familiar      with, so I'm open to feedback,) Apparently this handy      material is so little known that few garden stores stock      it. The only outlet I've found here in Cincinnati is the      Garden Center, which buys the wicking wholesale in rolls      and sells it by the foot as a non-profit service to garden      club members and area residents.</p><p>You'll also find wicking      listed on the back page of Melinger's Garden Catalog, 2310      West South Range Road, North Lima, Ohio 44452. The product      sold by that firm is primarily designed for watering potted      plants, but could probably be adapted to flats. Perhaps      MOTHER'S General Store could include a roll of wicking on      one of her shelves.</p><p>The beautiful thing about this indoor      gardening aid is that it eliminates all concern about how      much water to give young plants. The wick delivers exactly      the right amount of moisture at all times automatically.      Here with thanks to the professional who taught me is how      to use wicking effectively.    </p>        <p>      Cut the cord into lengths of approximately 10 inches and      fray about three inches of one end. Then poke a hole in the      bottom of your planting container, feed the unfrayed end      through from inside, and spread the raveled portion to      cover as much as possible of the pan's surface. Finally,      dump in the potting soil.    </p>    <p>      How many wicks to use depends on the size of the container.      I insert three if I'm planting a standard 11" X 21" flat,      and four for a plastic dishpan lettuce bed. That may be      more than necessary in the second case, but the moisture      does have to be drawn through five or six inches of soil      and I want to make sure there'll be plenty. There is, and      the crop flourishes. I suppose the best rule to follow is      to cover at least three-fourths of the container's bottom      with frayed wicking. This will assure every plant of easy      access to water.    </p>    <p>      The unfrayed ends of the wicks will be left dangling about      five or six inches below your flat or planting container.      Fill a second vessel with water (I use plastic dishpans for      this too A and place the flat or lettuce bed right on top.      Make certain the cords have more than just their tips      hanging in the liquid. The farther down they hang, the less      you have to be concerned about replenishing water in the      reservoir.    </p>    <p>      The soil which is so efficiently moistened by my wicking      consists of equal parts of peat moss, leaf mulch, and      topsoil. This mixture is fed to my earthworm colony for      several months to give the little critters time to work      their fertilizing magic. I've been told that a poorer grade      of earth is better for starting seedlings because it forces      them to root out more. get healthy plants that make the      trip to the garden with hardly a complaint, however, so I'm      happy with my own formula.    </p>    <p>      According to my professional advisor, milled sphagnum moss      used as a planting medium provides seeds with near perfect      conditions for germination. The product is easily obtained      from any garden store or through the mail from most seed      companies. You don't need a great deal of the sphagnum moss      a five pound sack will last me several seasons. To use the      planting medium, soak it in water and spread a thin layer      over the potting soil in the container. Scatter the seeds      and cover them with another thin layer of moss. This tucks      the future plants into a moist, sterile blanket.    </p>    <p>      Why sterile? You'll know if you've ever lost a planting      from damping off. This fungus disease which attacks young      plants and causes them to rot at the root-is much less      likely to occur when a sterile medium is used.    </p>    <p>      If you don't want to spend the money for milled sphagnum      moss, you can sterilize your own potting mixture. Just put      the earth in a container about four or five inches deep and      bury a small potato in the middle. Stick it in an oven at      2000 Farh and when the potato is done, the soil will be      sterile,    </p>    <p>      Once I have my container planted, it goes under lights. I      use two fluorescent fixtures, four feet in length, each      holding twit bulbs one grow light and one regular      fluorescent tube. Vegetables, and most flowers, don't need      total grow light if lumination and the use of a standard      bulb saves money. I find that this setup will take four      flats or four lettuce beds, which is plenty for my needs,    </p>    <p>      There you have it: good eating all winter and an almost      guaranteed, trouble-free method of raising plants come      spring.
