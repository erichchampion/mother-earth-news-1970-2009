                    <h5 id="byline">      by Shaun Ann Eddy    </h5>    <p>      I've been reading over my article on the horse and buggy in      MOTHER NO. 30 and would like to offer a few additional      hints since I find that I've assumed knowledge of some      points which might prove disastrous to a novice starting      out with a rig.    </p>        <p>      [1] A horse driven on ice in the winter and hot asphalt in      the summer needs borium dripped on the bottoms of his      shoes. This treatment prevents slipping (and possible leg      damage) and saves wear on the metal. Ask your blacksmith      about this precaution not all of them apply the borium      routinely.    </p>    <p>      [2] I mentioned that harness should be dipped twice a year      to preserve it. Actually, the process is more than a dip,      it's an overnight soaking of the leather in warm oil. Cut      open a large drum, place it over a burner, partly fill the      container with oil, heat the contents gently, and add the      harness (be sure all straps are submerged). Brush the      collar with the same lubricant and resign yourself to      getting your hands greasy every time you use the gear for      the next month.    </p>    <p>      [3] The only regular maintenance a buggy should need (apart      from an annual repainting) is the spring chore of      tightening the metal rim that protects the wooden wheel.      This band-called the tire-expands and contracts with      changes of temperature and moisture and when the weather      warms up I can expect to hear the clacking sound of a loose      rim. The noise warns me that stones and moisture will soon      work into the gap between metal and wood and damage the      wheel enough to warrant replacement (an expensive business,      and one that can be avoided by prompt action).    </p>    <p>      To correct a loose rim, the tire is taken off, the wood      joints of the wheel driven together, and any shaky bolts or      screws tightened or replaced. Then the metal band is heated      in a fire, replaced, pounded down firmly, and finally      dipped in cold water. A blacksmith needs a full day to do a      set of wheels and, around here, charges $20.00. (The front      and rear pairs generally seem to need attention in      alternate years.)    </p>    <p>      The cost of tightening the wheels, and $3.00 worth of buggy      paint every spring, are the only maintenance expenses      you're likely to have. That's a far cry from what you'd      spend to keep up an auto for a year!    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, I find that my article didn't go far enough      on the subject of protection for a buggy. A cover thrown      over the top of the rig really isn't sufficient, as I      implied the carriage house you'll often find built behind      or onto an old farmhouse was there for a reason. Our 1840      home has such an attachment, and that's where we keep, the      buggy and bob sleigh. The farm wagon and other horse-drawn      equipment are stored in a barn away from sun, rain, and      snow all of which are equally harmful.    </p>    <p>      [4] Don't hesitate to purchase a 10- or even 14-year-old      driving horse if you take a liking to him. Around here,      such animals are driven well into their twenties. Sure, a      young gelding is preferable as a long-term investment one      you can expect to keep around and in good health for years      of faithful service. But buy an aged horse for $100 or      $200, use him wisely for the rest of his working life, and      your transport will have paid for itself.    </p>    <p>      [5] I've heard arguments for and against the use of a      checkrein (a strap that comes off the top or side of the      harness bridle, snaps or buckles to the saddle pad, and      keeps the horse from lowering his head). Personally, I      prefer to loosen this restraint and let it hang to one      side. I'd much rather have Handy put his head down and      throw his neck muscles into his work especially going      uphill, when he must do so for good balance. He can't pull      properly with a tight checkrein yanking his head up to sky      level (and it looks absurd, too).    </p>    <p>      I hope these additional pointers will be helpful to anyone      who is considering a horse and buggy as a means of      transportation. After driving a rig for two years, I'm      absolutely convinced that it would be a bummer to go back      to auto payments, insurance fees, repair rip-offs,      warranties that always have a catch, and good old New York      State registration and license charges!.    </p>
