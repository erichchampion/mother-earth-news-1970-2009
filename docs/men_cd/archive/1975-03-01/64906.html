           			 			<h5 id="byline">by Lois McKeon    </h5>    <p>      While browsing through our favorite bookstore, my husband      and I came across a few early numbers of MOTHER . and      bought a copy of each, because the contents spoke to our      hidden desire for a truer, more natural way of life. We      subscribed, and each issue inspired us to further dreams of      a down-to-earth mode of living. Apart from some experiments      with sprouting and baking, however, dreaming was as far as      we went.    </p>      <p>      Then NO. 30 arrived, and Virginia Schmitz's article "How to      Reupholster Furniture" gave us the incentive to begin on      something practical: specifically, the restoration of an      Early American davenport (Photo 1) which was solid and in      good shape except for the disgracefully threadbare      covering. We didn't feel that we could afford either to buy      a new piece or to hire the old one redone and we certainly      didn't want to dispose of the poor thing, since we      sometimes have to use it for an extra bed. So, with      'Virginia's advice as moral support and our ragged couch as      stimulus, I set out in search of material.    </p>    <p>      My first stop was a well-known department store, where I      found the selection very limited partly because I wanted a      period design, and partly because of the prices. The two      possible fabrics I did turn up were marked to sell at $8.00      and $10.00 per yard (a total of $112 or $140 for the 14      yards I needed to reupholster the davenport). A check at      other department stores revealed the same conditions.    </p><p>Then I tried an upholstery and drapery house and    discovered tables of good material marked down for various    reasons: short lengths, outdated patterns, and manufacturers'    imperfections. Among the remnants were two pieces-seven and    eight yards respectively-that would have sold for $20.00 a    yard if perfect, but which had been reduced to $2.75 because    of small flaws. Since there seemed to be plenty of the    complete pattern to cover the main parts of the couch, I    bought the two lengths ($38.50 plus tax) and, with careful    planning, was able to match the design over all sections.</p>        <p>      My procedure in re-covering the davenport was one I had      learned back East. I chose this method-,which differs      somewhat from Virginia Schmitz's-because the old fabric was      firm and secure (though threadbare) and I didn't want to      remove it.</p><p> The first step was to slit the top of the      cording and remove the interior. I then bought four yards      of muslin (two yards for $1.00 at a discount store) and      covered the back and seat of the couch in the following      manner: I held the piece of fabric over the portion to be      reproduced, pinned around the shape, and cut outside the      markers leaving a seam allowance. The sections were pinned      together and laid on the davenport as a final check before      sewing. (If the old material is greasy, it must be cleaned      before the muslin is applied so the oil won't-bleed      through.) The finished inner cover was then stapled to the      framework. (See Photo 2.)</p><p> This preliminary operation gave      me the experience I needed to begin on the new upholstery      fabric, and also provided a more solid surface by      protecting the threadbare areas. The outer cover was made      in exactly the same way except that this time around I      inserted the cording (either during the sewing process or      by tacking where conditions allowed).</p><p> Photo 3 shows the      finished davenport. Its transformation cost a total of      $45.00, including materials, tacks, staples, thread, and      cording.    </p>        <p>      I'm writing in the hope that these few ideas may help      someone else. My method isn't as easy as Virginia's (in      which the stripped-off pieces of old covering serve as      models for the new). It does, however, offer a fairly      simple method of fitting and cutting without a pattern and      might give others the courage to reupholster a piece when      they realize that they don't have to uncover it first.</p><p> In      closing, I'd also like to mention how happy I am with the      whole concept of MOTHER and her very useful and practical      articles. With the economy in its present state, I'm sure      this magazine will continue to be a most instructive      publication. Thanks to MOM and her contributors!.    </p>
