                    <h3>      Independence on a 5 acre farm    </h3>    <p>      Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Two years ago, when there      were NO currently relevant small scale farming introductory      handbooks available, many of us welcomed the publication of      Richard Langer's Grow !t! with open arms. Now that we're      all older and more experienced, however, some folks find it      increasingly easy to criticize that breakthrough beginner's      guide (see the Feedback sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24 and      25). Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is      just as important (probably more so) now as Grow it! was      two years ago and which may well come up for its share of      criticism in another 24 months or so. Be that as it may,      John and Sally Seymour's record of 18 successful years on a      shirttail sized homestead in England is important now and      should offer welcome encouragement to today's back to the      landers both real and imaginary. I started serializing the      book in my No. 25 issue and I'm sure that many readers will      want a personal copy for their home      libraries.<strong>MOTHER.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      GRASS    </h3>    <p>      <em>Earth's increase, foison plenty,<br />      Barns and garners never empty.</em>    </p>    <p>      WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE: <em>The Tempest</em>    </p>    <p>      The crop that covers most of the human inhabited world is      grass. This means, in the British Isles, grass and clover:      in many other parts of the world grass and various edible      bushes. Humans cannot eat grass, and so they must get it at      second hand, through animals, in the form of meat, milk or      eggs.    </p>    <p>      Grassland, in the British Isles at least, can be classified      as either permanent pasture or ley (temporary pasture). It      can be divided corner ways to this too: into grazing land      and hay land.    </p>    <p>      Some of the best grassland in the world is permanent      pasture, and it is a crime to plough it up. Some of the      finest fattening pastures in England, such as the Romney      Marsh and some of the Leicestershire fattening pastures,      were ploughed up during the Second World War, owing to      stupid decisions made by ignorant people, and have never      yet recovered. Much permanent pasture, though, is pretty      rough, and not very productive. It can be rendered more so      by ploughing up and re seeding, or by treatment that does      not involve ploughing up. Very heavy and drastic harrowing      does a lot of good; you can drag it about until it looks as      if most of the grass has been destroyed and the grass will      be the better for it. Dressing with lime if it needs lime      will often work wonders, as will slag or other phosphorous      dressing. Both lime and phosphate encourage the clover at      the expense of the grasses, and this is generally all to      the good. Good draining is, of course, a sine quo non.      Grass (when I use the word grass I mean grass and clover)      will give you far more yield if you graze it really hard      all at one time, and then rest it completely, rather than      if you keep nibbling at it all the time. This is because      the individual plants put down much better root growth if      they are not kept nibbled off all the time. It is always a      good thing to top grass, when it needs it, either with a      mower of some sort or a scythe. This cuts the flowering      heads off that the animals have left and forces the grass      to make leaf instead of going to seed, and also kills the      thistles. The application of nitrogen encourages the      grasses and suppresses the clovers. This is because the      clovers make their own nitrogen out of the atmosphere, by      means of the symbiotic bacteria which live in their root      nodules. This gives them an unfair advantage over the      grasses. If you apply soluble nitrogen you take away this      unfair advantage, and the grasses will grow at the expense      of the clover. If you want very high yields from grass you      must put on nitrogen and sacrifice the clovers. Personally      I would prefer to give adequate phosphates and lime, and      potash if it needs it, and this encourage the clovers and      then I don't have to pay for nitrogen: the clover makes it.      It has been proved conclusive, that the grass produced by      heavy applications of nitrogen not so nutritious as that      grown otherwise, but of course if they are, say, selling      hay what does that matter? If you are using the hay      yourself, though, it is a very different story. All      nitrogen in the bag is expensive. And if ever there is a      poorly shortage (nitrogen is fixed commercially from the      air by the expenditure of electrical power) it will become      more so. Heap: applications of farmyard manure do nothing      but good. Tits manure rots down and disappears very      quickly: actually earthworms drag it down into the soil.      But if it is cow manure don't graze the land with cows for      a while no animal likes grazing near its own droppings.      Where cows have been grazing in a field for long you will      find long green tufts of grass growing around, or after,      their droppings. The cows will not touch these. Put horses      in though, or sheep, and the tufts will very soon go. This      is another excellent reason for mixed stocking and not mono      stocking.    </p>    <p>      It is as well if you can retain some permanent pasture to      make your holding, if you are going to keep any animals.      remember in the Karroo, in the Cape Province, my employer      on a big sheep farm had ploughed up some veld (which was      gill sparsely growing Karroo bushes) and planted lucerne,      which he irrigated, In these paddocks he put his pedigree      rams. They began to sicken and some of them died. The vet      told him to re-fence the paddocks, taking in some of the      Karroo pasture. He did this and immediately the rams got      better. Ley pasture can be extremely productive, but      permanent pasture will have more of those minerals and      vitamins that animals require. So keep some permanent      pasture if you can possibly afford me land.    </p>    <p>      If you want to break up permanent pasture to make arable      land, or to plough and re-seed, then take my advice and do      it with pigs. Shove in your unringed pigs, fold them over      the land in small patches and move them on when they've      thoroughly rooted up the small patches; pull the land about      behind them with a spring tine harrow or a spring      cultivator; broadcast your seed. Another way (which we have      tried) is to plough the old pasture up rough and as you do      it plough Jerusalem artichokes in. Do this in the winter or      very early spring. The arti-choke will grow and smother      every living thing under them with their dense, jungle like      cover. They will, if there are any about, attract pheasants      by the score. Never mind the pheasants put the pigs in, in      late summer, fold them over the field all autumn and      winter, and the pigs will thrive and leave the land as      clean as a whistle. In the spring you can do what you want      with it.    </p>    <p>      Probably the most profitable use of a small piece of land      would be to farm it on a rotation that included one year in      four of a one year ley. The famous Norfolk Four Course      Rotation (wheat roots barley one year ley) is an example of      this. With the great variety of crops that the self      supporter will tend to grow his rotations must be far more      complicated. You might grow something like: wheat, roots or      kale to be fed to stock, potatoes or any of a great variety      of row crops that have to be hoed and thus lend themselves      to the suppression of weeds, 'cleaning crops' they are      called then spring corn of some sort, barley, spring wheat      or oats and undersow this with your ley a grass and clover      mixture. If you have decided on a one year ley this mixture      will be chiefly Italian rye grass and red clover. A typical      seeds mixture for a one year ley might be: 20 Ibs. Italian      rye, 8 Ibs. red clover, 1 Ib. alsike Italian rye grass      gives an 'early bite', that is it comes up early in the      year when everything is dying for grass soon after the      'hungry gap'. In fact it shortens the latter and therefore      it is very valuable. You broadcast this seeds mixture after      you have either broadcast or drilled your spring corn      (barley, oats or spring wheat or rye you couldn't undersow      maize of course). You then harrow the land and the seeds      mixture will come up as an undercrop, with the corn as a      nurse crop. When you cut the corn you will have a good      stand of grass and clover. Graze it lightly the' first      autumn (the treading of the stock will help consolidate the      plants), rest it throughout the winter, and rejoice in an      'early bite' in March or April. After having had a full      summer's use out of it for grazing or hay plough it up in      the autumn and sow your winter wheat in it. The winter corn      will benefit by the high fertility that is put into the      soil by the ploughing in of all that grass and clover, plus      the droppings of the animals that have grazed on it. The      'root break', that comes after the winter corn, is the one      that gets the heavy dressings of farmyard manure. If you      can put up to twenty tons to the acre on the land before      you sow the roots, or plant the spuds, so much the better.      If you go on treating your land in this way, and really hoe      your roots or cleaning crop, And really do it all well,      your land will increase steadily in fertility, workability      and freedom from perennial weeds. When you die you will      leave something valuable behind you: land in good heart.      There's an immortality that is worth having.    </p>    <p>      You can, though, improve on the Norfolk Four Course      Rotation by the addition of a pig break. There are several      possibilities here. You should anyway run pigs over your      potato and root ground after you have lifted the crop to      clean it up and get what you have left. Or you could fold      pigs on the one year ley in the autumn and winter instead      of ploughing it up. The pigs will plough it up for you. But      that means that you can't get winter wheat in it that year      you'll have to follow the pigs with a spring sown crop,      either roots or spring corn. There are endless variations      that you can play. Remember though that roots (turnips,      marigolds, fodder beets, sugar beets, potatoes, and      cabbages, kale or rape by favour) are your cleaning crop.      You must hoe them and hoe them and kill the weeds. The ley,      whether one, two or three years old, is your putting back      of fertility crop. You are, with it, ploughing in a lot of      vegetable matter which all rots down to humus. The winter      corn, probably wheat, is a 'cash crop' in that it draws a      lot out of the land. So does the spring corn, but that acts      as a nurse for your ley. The roots, too, are a feeding crop      in that you ought to manure them heavily, to the benefit      not only of them but of the crops that come after.    </p>    <p>      If you want to have a two or three year ley, or longer,      then you will need a much more complicated seeds mixture,      and this is a fairly typical one:    </p>    <p>      12 lbs. perennial rye grass 8 Ibs. Italian rye grass 6 Ibs.      cocksfoot grass 2 Ibs. red clover 2 Ills. late red clover I      Ib. alsike 1 Ib. Dutch white clover    </p>    <p>      But your agricultural adviser from the Ministry of      Agriculture will advise you on a suitable mixture for your      district. If you want to put down permanent pasture you      could have something like this:    </p>    <p>      14 Ibs. perennial rye grass 8 lbs. cocksfoot 4 lbs. timothy      1 Ib. rough stalked meadow grass 4 Ibs. late flowering red      clover 1 Ib. wild white clover      ------------      32 Ibs. per acre    </p>    <p>      In the above the red clover is to give a good bulk of      clover the first year. If you can bear to sacrifice this      bulk in the first year I would leave it out. This will give      the wild white a better chance, and it is the wild white      that is going to give you your permanent clover component.      On very good rich land I would omit the cocksfoot. It will      grow too coarse and rampant, and is rather an unpalatable      grass anyway. Cut the timothy out on dry soils, it only      really comes into its own on wet land. On light land cut      the rough stalked meadow grass out: that again is a wet      land crop, or on good strong loams or clays. Again don't      hesitate to get expert advice about your particular      locality. There's nothing to beat the advice of your      farming neighbors. Deep rooting herbs are often included in      permanent grass mixtures. M. McG. Cooper suggests:    </p>        <p>      1 1/2 2Ibs. chicory<br />      1 1/2 21bs. burnet<br />      1 lb. ribgrass or plantain<br />      1 lb., sheeps parsley<br />      Personally I should leave out the plantain. M. McG.      Cooper's book Grassland Farming is, incidentally, a very      good one. To establish your pasture, broadcast the seed on      a very good firm seedbed either in the spring alone, in the      spring under a nurse crop (barley or oats or spring wheat)      or in late summer. If own graze it lightly later in the      first summer. If sown in the late summer graze it lightly      in the late spring. Don't overgraze it the first summer.      <strong>HAY</strong><br />      The earlier you cut the hay the more nutritious it will be,      but the smaller the tonnage of it. We cut ours in July      after the sheep shearing. Good weather is absolutely all      important. If it. stays fine you may get all your hay under      cover in a few days and it will be perfect. Cutting can be      done by scythe, horse mower or powered mower. A man is      supposed to be able to cut an acre a day with a scythe. I      have cut hay with a scythe, in South West Africa of all      places, and very hard work it is too. You must keep the      blade as sharp as a razor, and use a finer wet stone (or      'rubber') than that which you would use for corn. A horse      drawn mower needs two good horses. Pulling a mower is very      hard work for horses. The French have experimented with a      horse drawn mower the blade of which is driven not by the      ground wheels, but by a fractional horsepower petrol motor      like a chain saw motor. This is said to be wonderfully      effective, and its consumption of fuel is almost      negligible. I have not seen it, but believe such machines      can be seen working at Anthony, near Paris. Power mowers      can be reciprocating or rotary. This year our hay was late,      badly laid and matted and we hired a neighbor with a rotary      mower. It made a very good job.    </p>        <p>      The old fashioned method (in which 1 was brought up) was to      turn the swathes by hand either with a pitch fork or a      wooden rake, according to taste. As you turn them over      fluff them up. Nowadays you can get an astonishing variety      of machines to do this for you. There were some good      machines that were pulled by horses for doing this work.      When the hay is dry rake it up into big windrows, either      with the big wooden drag rake or with a hoarser. You can      still occasionally pick a horse rake up fairly cheaply and      they are good tools. Then, when you are sure it is dry      enough, the old idea was to cock it. Pile it up into little      mini stacks higher than a man and dome shaped. Let it dry      in the cock until the green has really gone out of it. If      it is still too moist, and heating inside the cock, well      then you must break the cocks and spread it about a bit. If      it comes on to rain you must rush out and cock is quickly.      In the cock it won't take much harm. When it is quit: dry      you can cart it, and stack it. Either stack it in a barn o!      else thatch the stack with straw or rushes.    </p>    <p>      Even then your troubles are not over. If it is stacked out      of doors you must cut it with a stack knife before you can      fee it. And that's a job to make the sweat run down your      face.    </p>    <p>      The modern way is to bale it. There are plenty of      contractors who will do this work, but everybody wants them      at once. The modern way is to throw the hay about hard as      soon as it is cutscatter it well. There is a great variety      of machines to do this, all tractor drawn. As soon as it is      anything like dry (you keep turning it about with machines      as often as you can) you get it into windrows again and      bale it. If the baler is busy somewhere else that day and      can't come and it pours with rain that night well you may      lose half the value o your hay and you may lose it      altogether. If you can bale it though, it is pretty safe.      But as soon as you can get the bale under cover, you can      then heave a mighty sigh of relief and turn to a well      earned gallon or two of home brewed beer.    </p>    <p>      If you start the winter with at least a ton of hay per head      of large stock (cows and horses) and a few tons for any      sheep you may have, you can feel fairly secure. A very good      yield is two tons per acre: you may get less. You can bump      up the yield of grass enormously by applications of      nitrogenous fertilizer, it you have no ideological      objections to this. Personally I have pecuniary ones, but I      do it on a modest scale sometimes nevertheless.    </p>
