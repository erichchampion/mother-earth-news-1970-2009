                        <p>      Long before the recent breakthroughs in vertical axis wind      turbine design, the basic idea was conceived independently      by many experimenters and worked up in several forms. One      such invention has been operating continuously since 1958,      and its owner was kind enough to send me the following      description. --MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      In answer to an inquiry from MOTHER about my family's      experiments with the vertical axis wind turbine: This      machine made its first appearance, to my knowledge, about      1921 when William H. Swett (my father) built such a device      and installed it on a well somewhere in the vicinity of      Lovelock, Nevada. The plant was a failure due to the lack      of a governor and was demolished by a strong wind.    </p>    <p>      We did nothing further with the concept until 1958, when I      built a small commercial garage and decided to install a      wind turbine to pump the water I needed for my operations.      I designed perhaps half a dozen governors all of them      either too easy to vandalize or too complex to construct,      with many critical parts that tended to wear out. Finally I      came up with a satisfactory solution: a hydraulic governor      of sealed construction, with two bearings that run in an      oil bath at all times and carry a very light load. This      device limits the speed of the turbine to 475-600 rpm and      has very little drag below 475 rpm.    </p>    <p>      The completed windplant has been in continuous service      since its installation in 1958 and has had its bearings      greased twice during the 16-year period. All that time it      has pumped water for the shop, and I've used it      simultaneously to charge batteries with the help of an      automobile generator and alternator.    </p>    <p>      The device attracted quite a bit of attention at first, but      no buyers. (There was no apparent energy crisis during      1958, you'll recall, or for several years thereafter.) Some      people did express interest in using a wind turbine for      irrigation or power generation but eventually they'd ask,      "What do you do when the wind doesn't blow?" and I'd answer      truthfully, "The machine doesn't work, of course." That      ended the matter, and the prospective customer proceeded to      install a diesel,gasoline, or electric-driven pump.    </p>    <p>      Recent events, however, have very materially changed the      picture, and a good many people are now looking to one o:      man's oldest power sources, the wind. (There's at least one      recorded instance of a working windmill in 600 B.C . and      how far back in history do we find mention of sailing      ships?; Now we've gone the complete circle, back to the      same cheap and inexhaustible resource used in ancient      times.    </p>    <p>      This renewal of interest made me decide to build another      vertical axis wind turbine from easily obtainable materials      with a minimum of cash outlay. I finally finished an 8' X 6      rotor turbine with a total expenditure of $42.00. All the      makings other than the galvanized sheet iron for the wind      deflector and rotor vanes were selected from scrap and      acquired at no cost.    </p>    <p>      This newer model (see the photographs) has a large vee      pulley on the rotor drive shaft and a belt with a half      twist to turn a small pulley on a horizontal jack shaft. A      large pulley on the jack shaft to a small pulley on an      alternator or generator imparts sufficient speed to      generate full capacity with any wind of 10 mph up. A belt      runs from the jack shaft to a reducing gear and thence to a      pump jack that operates a plunger-type cylinder pump to      fill an overhead tank.    </p>    <p>      I'm selling sets of plans for the turbine for $25.00, and      may have manufactured parts available in the future.      Instructions can be ordered from C.L. Swett, P.O. Box 657,      Winnemucca, Nevada 89445.    </p>
