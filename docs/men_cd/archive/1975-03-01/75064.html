             			      <p>Man made rot is eating at the heart of      nature. We are depoiling the heritage of our sons, our      grandsons, and their grandsons.</p>     <p>And now-direct from England-the world's most conscientious      ecology cartoon feature. A little overstated for our      American tastes, perhaps, but full of real meat,      nonetheless. Ah, if we only had a cartoon series like this      on our side of the pond! But, since we don't MOTHER      presents Mr. Crabtree Crusades!    </p>        <p>      Modern farming methods make a pan in the soil-a rock-hard      layer under the top soil. So, when heavy rain comes it does      not sink gently in as used to be so. It pours off, makes      torrents, sending the river into flood and making the coot      build its nest high for the safety of the--eggs. The rain      passes and the depleted river sinks sluggishly, leaving the      nest like a tower. Impoverished soil carried off the fields      by the flood, adds to the mud, slows the current further      and encourages rank growth where the clean current used to      flow. So, Mr. Crabtree tells Peter, the river deteriorates      progressively-the more mud settles, the more rank weed      grows to trap more mud, and so on. Thus the river sickens.    </p>        <p>      Sad change, man-made, has come to the river, but Peter is a      boy as his father and his grandfather were boys, and if      fish are in water he must fish. His catch, triumph to him      but depressing to Mr. Crabtree, is far more significant      than he knows. There is no more finely accurate barometer      of the health of the environment than the rivers that run      in it and the creatures that live in them. Everything in      the land, good or bad, ends in the river and thence to the      sea. So when river life becomes thin and poor, and,      particularly, fish are weak and runted, look sharply at the      land. Most rivers in Britain are less good than they were,      some in creeping decline, some ruined.    </p>
