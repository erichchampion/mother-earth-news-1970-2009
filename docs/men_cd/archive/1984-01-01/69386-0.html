        COVER-UP NO. 1, THE POP-IN SHUTTER: [1]After assembling a wooden frame to fit your window, lay it on a sheet of insulation so you can mark and cut out the beadboard. Do this again with another piece of insulation so that the shutter will be two layers thick. [2] Once you've thoroughly glued the two sections of beadboard together, run some additional adhesive along the inside of the frame. [3] A completed, airtight corner. [4] The final product is easy to install . . . attractive . . . and very inexpensive! COVER-UP NO. 2, A BEADBOARD PANEL: [5] This large, unframed heat holder is held in place by salvaged magnetic strips that have been glued into channels along the insulation. [6] A completed panel will help keep Old Man Winter from knocking on your glass doors!
