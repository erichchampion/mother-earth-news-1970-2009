                    <p>      <em>Foraging for nutritious native edibles doesn't have to      be a fair-weather activity!</em></p>			<h5 id="byline">by James E. Churchill</h5>        <p>      In my opinion, the mark of a <em>real</em> wild-food      forager is his or her ability to rustle up a square meal      from nature's larder <em>in the dead of winter</em> .      That's why, one cold day up here in northern Wisconsin-with      the temperature hovering around 9 Â°F-I decided to      put myself and a neighbor's son (a young fellow who had      never searched for native edibles before) to a test: Come      dinnertime, we would either sit down to a hearty foraged      feast . . . or go hungry.<br />      <br />      Actually, I had another motive for my idea, too. I wanted      to teach Muskrat (a nickname given my companion by his      father, in reference to the lad's inborn affinity for      water) the value of our region's wetlands as a source of      food. I knew that streams and marshes are prime foraging      territory year round . . . and I wanted to illustrate that      important point to the youngster.<br />      <br />      So Muskrat and I sat down to plot our strategy and decided      that-with any luck-our menu that night would be      a chowder of cattail shoots, watercress, and freshwater      clams (actually a type of mussel found in this part of the      country) . . . biscuits made from cattail-root flour . . .      roast rabbit . . . and highbush cranberries for dessert. I      figured that we could find all those goodies within walking      distance. I suspect that Muskrat, on the other hand,      probably wasn't quite so sure. Nevertheless, he grabbed his      .22 rifle while I rustled up a plastic bag and a couple of      pairs of insulated rubber "trapper's gloves". Then we      headed off (dressed in appropriately warm garb, including      watertight boots) for a nearby ice-free stream.<br />      <br />      <strong>CLAMS 'N' CATTAILS</strong><br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      Even in these parts, where freshwater mussels abound,      finding the succulent wild-lings can be difficult if you      don't know where to look. In the summer, I frequently      search along the banks of streams until I come across      shells left by marauding raccoons. Usually, two or three      such remnants in the same place mean a clam bed is nearby.      But during the winter, of course, snow covers the ground      and hides the evidence.<br />      <br />      So, Muskrat and I simply waded into the creek and headed      upstream (that way, any silt we kicked up would be carried      away behind us), peering intently into the water and      feeling around on the bottom with our gloved hands for      clam-shaped objects. Sometimes the little rascals are      almost entirely buried in mud-with just the edges of      their shells protruding-and sometimes they're lying      flat, hidden among a seemingly infinite number of      <em>rocks</em> of a similar form. But persistence generally      pays off . . . particularly if you search (as Muskrat and I      did) around the downstream sides of boulders or other large      obstructions-or at the upstream end of a deep      pool-where the diminished current drops floating food      to the bottom and into the open mouths of waiting      shellfish. Within a few minutes my young apprentice and I      had extricated four good-sized freshwater clams . . .      enough for our chowder.<br />      <br />      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: All bivalves are filter feeders and      thus readily accumulate pollutants and pathogens in their      bodies. It's important, therefore, that you forage      shellfish only from pure waters.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Also, you should keep in mind that of the approximately      300 species of freshwater mussels in this country (nearly      all of which are edible), 16 are included on the federal      government's endangered species list . . . and others are      protected on the lists of individual states. Because these      varieties are rare, your chances of coming across one on an      occasional foraging outing are very slim . . .      nevertheless, you should check with your state's wildlife      or natural resources authorities before you go mussel      hunting, just to see what the situation is in your locale.      Some specific areas may be closed to the      practice.]</em><br />      <br />      With the quartet of shells safely ensconced in our      collecting bag (along with enough water to keep the      bivalves submerged and fresh), we waded ashore and walked      along the bank in search of cattails. We'd hiked only a few      hundred feet when we came to a good stand of the plant,      with its characteristically spiky, cornlike leaves poking      out of the snow. When we cleared the white stuff away from      a small patch and chopped through the ice below, we could      see water about a foot deep.<br />      <br />      Muskrat stuck a gloved hand into the marsh, felt around in      the mud until he got a good hold on the ropelike roots of      one plant, and with a mighty heave pulled the whole      mass-roots, stems, and leaves-out onto the ice.      He repeated the procedure twice. I chopped the roots from      the stems and washed the mud from the skins and from the      tender white shoots that tapered out of the brown      rhizomes.<br />      <br />      As we worked, I pointed out to Muskrat that chopping a hole      in an ice-covered marsh is like opening the door to a      winter pantry: Besides cattail roots and shoots, you can      find crayfish, bullheads, frogs, turtles, arrowhead tubers,      pond-lily roots, and a wide variety of other delicious wild      edibles. Then I stuffed our cattail harvest into the bag,      and we set out in search of the final ingredient for our      chowder: watercress.<br />      <br />      Now most fair-weather foragers are familiar with this      pungent green, but not very many folks know that a      well-established patch of watercress-which requires      clean, cold water and fertile bottom soil in which to      grow-will do quite well even in the middle of winter. I      knew that we were close to a cress bed that-in the      summer-covers nearly half an acre . . . and sure      enough, when we arrived there, several good-sized bunches      were waving in the incoming current of a little feeder      spring.<br />      <br />      Since watercress <em>looks</em> tough and well-rooted,      Muskrat made a common mistake: Before I could stop him, he      grabbed hold of several plant tops and tugged hard . . .      and they pulled completely out of the soil, roots and all.      I explained to him that since the roots are unpalatable,      it's a much better idea to pinch or cut the plant of just      below the leaves, leaving the roots intact to produce      another generation of salad greens. Anyway, with that      lesson learned, we proceeded to harvest enough for our      stew.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SURPRISING EVENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      By the time we'd gathered our clams, cattails, and cress,      we were ready for a break . . . so Muskrat and I sat down      next to a big evergreen to soak up the afternoon sun.<br />      <br />      Suddenly, a meadow mouse flashed out of its hiding place      beneath a low-hanging snow-covered limb, and      Muskrat-quick as a cat-reached out and caught      the little animal in his gloved hand. The boy studied the      vole (and vice versa!) for a minute or so, blowing gently      on its fur to observe its thick winter coat. My guess is      that this action probably deposited a strong human scent on      the critter . . . at least, that's the only      <em>reasonable</em> explanation I can think of for what      happened next.<br />      <br />      When the youngster put the mouse back down on the snow, the      timid rodent ran straight into a nearby rabbit burrow to      escape . . . and almost immediately we heard a terrific      thumping and squealing down in the hole. A split second      later, a cottontail squirted out of the opening, going so      fast that it was literally airborne! Before we could fully      grasp the <em>situation</em> , another rabbit flew out and      joined its partner under a brush pile a short distance      away.<br />      <br />      Well, since rabbit was on our menu, we could hardly ignore      this loud knock of opportunity. We loaded the .22, chased      the rabbits out into the open, and quickly dispatched one      while the other ran free.<br />      <br />      Loaded down with our "groceries", we headed back home . . .      stopping only long enough to pluck a supply of frozen      cranberries from a bush studded with the tenaciously      clinging bright red fruit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MMM-MMM-GOOD!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Foraging for food on a cold winter's day is not only an      interesting and enjoyable outdoor activity . . . it's      downright <em>hungrifying</em> . By the time we got back to      the old homestead and warmed ourselves by the woodstove, we      were ready to eat, so we hurried to prepare our      feast.<br />      <br />      While Muskrat commenced skinning and cleaning our rabbit, I      proceeded to whip up the chowder. First, I washed the      cattail roots and snapped of the shoots, setting the brown      ropy pieces aside to be converted into flour. Then I peeled      the shoots and sliced them wafer-thin, and washed and      chopped several sprigs of watercress. That done, I scrubbed      the clam shells <em>very</em> thoroughly, and placed them,      along with about 1/2 cup of water, in a pan on the stove.      When the mussels had begun to open from the heat, I removed      them and let them cool . . . pried the shells apart (I      stuck a knife in past the lips and cut the muscle) . . .      and excised the meat, holding the shells over the broth pan      to catch any juices that ran out. In the summer, freshwater      clams' stomachs are usually full of a black material that      must be cut away and discarded, and the pot liquor and      juices must be drained through a fine cloth to filter out      impurities . . . but these wintertime specimens didn't seem      to need such processing.<br />      <br />      Next, I put the clam meat through a crank-type food      grinder, again making sure to reserve the juice and add it      to the broth. Then I put the "clamburger" into the pan with      the pot liquor . . . added the sliced shoots and chopped      watercress, along with a little salt and pepper . . . and      placed the soup on the back of the stove to simmer.<br />      <br />      By the time I'd finished the chowder, Muskrat had cleaned      and cut the rabbit into six or seven pieces and was shaking      the washed, drained chunks of meat in a bag containing      whole wheat flour and a bit of salt. He then browned the      flour-coated pieces in a skillet with just a little butter,      put the meat in a deep baking dish, and placed the dish in      the oven (which we'd preheated to about 300 Â°F) to bake      for 1-1/2 hours.<br />      <br />      The next job on the list was to make cattail-root flour for      our biscuits: I cut the washed roots into six-inch lengths,      put the chunks through the food grinder (after cleaning out      the clam meat, of course), and spooned the fibrous mash      into a pan filled with cold water. In a few minutes the      root fibers and skin floated to the top, while the heavier      starch-the "good stuff'-remained on the bottom.      I simply skimmed the debris off with my hand, carefully      poured the water away, and there was my biscuit flour. Some      folks might want to repeat the grinding/ floating      process-to refine the product a bit more-and      many foragers prefer to dry the moist starch before using      it. But since all dough recipes call for the addition of      liquid anyway, I just go ahead and use the damp, "fresh"      starch, mixed half and half with toasted whole wheat      flour.<br />      <br />      At this point, I must admit, the enticing aroma of the      simmering soup and the roasting rabbit had set our stomachs      to growling like a pair of hungry puppies, so I wasted no      time at all in putting together a batch of biscuits. Here's      the recipe I used: Mix together I/2 cup of cattail-root      flour, 1/2 cup of toasted whole wheat flour, 1 teaspoon of      baking powder, a dash of salt, and-if      necessary-some water, to make a sticky dough. Then      form the batter into half-inch-thick palm-sized patties and      fry them in just a bit of corn oil in a skillet until      they're golden brown.<br />      <br />      Of course, we still had dessert to prepare too, so I put      the hot biscuits in the warming oven while Muskrat washed      and stemmed our foraged cranberries. I then poured the      fruit and enough water to cover it in a pan and simmered      the berries until they burst open and released their      juices. Next, I added enough honey to sweeten them . . .      stirred in some powdered gelatin (2 teaspoons of gelatin      for every pint of liquid) . . . and put the sauce into the      refrigerator to cool. I knew that by the time we'd eaten      our dinner and given our stomachs an hour or so afterward      to rest, the delicacy would be firm and ready to serve with      whipped cream. Yum!    </p>    <p>      <strong>A MEMORABLE MEAL</strong>    </p>    <p>      I don't think I have to tell you we <em>didn't</em> go      hungry that night. Even more satisfying than the hearty      meal, though, was the feeling of accomplishment: Not only      had we successfully foraged a nourishing meal from the      "barren" winter landscape, but-in the      process-we'd also learned a little more about, and      grown closer to, the natural world that supports us    </p>
