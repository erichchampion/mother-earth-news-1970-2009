                <p>      REPORT FROM:    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Cathy Johnson    </h5>         <p>      Leaving Dandelion Farm was one of the most painful things      my husband "Sleepy" and I have ever done. Like other MOTHER      folk, we'd dreamed for years about owning a little piece of      the good life. We even practiced for the big move by      foraging for wild foods in vacant fields, and by gardening      on our tiny city lot . . . interspersing green beans with      the roses and planting squash in the ornamental rock      garden. But mostly, we just planned, and saved, and      dreamed, and talked . . . and planned some more.<br />      <br />      When we finally found our land and made the big move, it      was as if the elusive dream had come true: There it was,      Dandelion Farm, nestled into a bend of a pretty little      creek, waiting for us at the end of a quarter mile of      winding drive. It was so beautiful!<br />      <br />      Well, we put the next seven years into building that      particular castle in the sky, and when we finally had to      admit that we were beaten, we felt totally lost. We didn't      know where to go from there, and we couldn't imagine who      we'd be when we got to wherever it was we'd go. Our      identities were so bound up in our self-image as      back-to-the-landers, living in gentle harmony with the      earth, that leaving was a real emotional blow.      Besides-we had to admit it-we had      <em>failed</em> .<br />      <br />      Why? Well, <em>age</em> , for one thing . . . Sleepy and I      were not youngsters. Coping with a perpetually cold,      140-year-old house-with no indoor plumbing-was      another reason. Most of all, though, it was probably      inexperience combined with two years of incredibly harsh      summer droughts and winter storms that finally did us      in.<br />      <br />      Sounds like a sad story, doesn't it? We <em>were</em> sad,      believe me. But we didn't give up. My mate and I decided to      find the best life we could, no matter <em>where</em> we      were. And as it has turned out, we've found that good life      in a small Victorian house in the little town of Excelsior      Springs, Missouri. In fact, we began turning the place into      our new dream the day we moved in.<br />      <br />      Right away, I fell in love with the three old plum trees in      the backyard and the vestiges of rhubarb showing along the      north fence . . . someone else had once used this place to      try to live close to the land. My husband and I tilled the      soil in half of the backyard and claimed it as our garden      space. By using raised growing beds and intensive      gardening, we got an amazing yield from our tiny 15' X 20'      plot the first year: beans, peas, onions, tomatoes,      cabbage, broccoli, kohlrabi, squash, beets, lettuce,      radishes, and whatever else we felt like experimenting      with.<br />      <br />      Then, three years ago, my interest in herbs outgrew the      space we'd allotted them, and we began digging up the yard      again. A curving herb bed now connects the garden to the      side yard and overflows with sage, catnip, lemon balm, gray      santolina, lavender, and mint. The comfrey has its own      space outside the garden, and anything we don't      <em>grow</em> , we can get by swapping with neighbors or      foraging for in the nearby park.<br />      <br />      Ah, the park . . . the free-growing blackberries we find      there give us all the jellies and syrups we need, and the      wild greens and morels add even more variety to our menu.      (OK, so maybe we don't "own" the native edibles we pick, as      we did on the farm. But does anyone ever really      <em>own</em> nature's gardens?)<br />      <br />      And we've made significant strides toward self-sufficiency      <em>inside</em> our home, too. I've fashioned homemade      solar energy storers by filling black-painted plastic milk      jugs with water and placing them in the south-facing      windows. And last year, instead of installing clear plastic      on the inside of the one southern portal that isn't      protected with a storm window, I used <em>black</em>      plastic with a small vent hole cut at the top . . .      surprisingly, that simple setup turned out to be an      efficient, super-inexpensive heat grabber!<br />      <br />      Still experimenting, I found that pop-in plastic-foam      shutters help cut nighttime heat loss and are easy to store      in the daytime. Insulated curtains made from old quilts      also help keep the evening chill outside, while we insulate      ourselves by snuggling under a homemade comforter.<br />      <br />      For a long time, we debated the practicality of buying a      ceiling fan for the living room . . . Sleepy lost his job      in April of 1982, and money gets a good squeeze around here      before we let it get away. When we finally purchased the      air mover, though, we soon realized we'd made the right      decision. With our high Victorian ceilings, the fan is a      lifesaver on hot summer days. And in winter-set on      low speed-it blows warm air from the stove into every      room of the house. (The folks who designed and built these      turn-of-the-century Victorian houses were no dummies: The      high ceilings make it possible to store a lot of heat, and      the connecting doors between all the rooms promote      efficient circulation.)<br />      <br />      This fall we finally installed our antique woodstove . . .      an investment we'll never regret. Now, the gas furnace goes      on only well after midnight, and we keep it at a low enough      setting that it runs very little. Our vintage stove      <em>does</em> burn more wood than a modern, airtight      heater, but with the doors open it converts into a cheery      fireplace, and the oven directly over the firebox turns out      a procession of rolls, pies, toasted cheese sandwiches, and      even stews. The top also has lids like a cookstove,      so-all in all-our old beauty adds a surprising      amount to our independence.<br />      <br />      Growing toward self-sufficiency is an organic thing, and,      as such, takes time. Our plans often seem to take shape      slowly, but the changes are steady and positive. Natural      gas prices have more than doubled in the last two years,      and electrical costs have jumped as well, but we've kept      pace and even <em>lowered</em> our monthly bills.<br />      <br />      Did we lose our identities when we left Dandelion Farm? Did      we "fail" as we were convinced we had at the time? Now, I      can see that while Sleepy and I may not be farmers, living      close to nature doesn't have to mean owning 20 acres and      using an outhouse. Here in town, we still grow our own food      and heat with wood. My clothes still dry in the fresh air      and smell sunny. Certainly, the wildlife on the farm was      delightful, but we've had a fox, raccoons, and possums      visit us right here on our little Victorian homestead. We      also feed hundreds of birds, and share our garden with      beneficial toads and ladybugs. The deer come to drink in      the park only two blocks away, and an old Tom turkey and      five of his lady friends cross the road not three blocks      from our house. And to top off the wildlife scene, a great      blue heron fishes in a nearby creek and takes flight      majestically on its seven-foot wingspan at our      approach.<br />      <br />      We may have failed as farmers-and perhaps as bona      fide back-to-the-landers-but I think we're two of the      happiest "failures" you're ever likely to meet. No sir, if      I were asked to give advice today about buying a farm, I'd      say, "Great idea! Do it if you have the youth, strength .      .. and money. If not, look around at the possibilities      right where you <em>are</em> ."<br />      <br />      After all, Sleepy and I have learned from experience that      dreams don't really die . . . they just change form.    </p>
