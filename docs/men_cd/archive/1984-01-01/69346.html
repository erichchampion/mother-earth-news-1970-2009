                    <p>      <em><strong>WELCOME</strong></em> . . . to our mini-manual      of winter craft projects. The following 12 pages contain      something for knitters and crocheters of every level of      skill, from an easy scarf to a multi-cabled sweater.      (There's also an illustrated section explaining the basics      of both arts to aid the novice and to help jar the memory      of the rusty.)<br />      <br />      Of course, there may, be a few people who initially won't      be enthusiastic about such enterprises. "Why knit?" a      noncraftsperson may grumble as he or she      watches-fascinated nonetheless-while      brilliant-hued Fair Isle sweaters, intricate fisherman's      jerseys, or complicated cable pullovers emerge from an      experienced knitter's speedily clicking needles. Well,      aside from the satisfaction of creating a beautiful      garment, knitting offers you the chance to do it better for      less: We figured out from a yarn-sample card that an      Icelandic sweater (retailing for $125) could be knitted for      about $25 in yarn!<br />      <br />      To be sure, that's using your own labor, but what kind of      price can you attach to what might otherwise be      <em>wasted</em> time, anyway? You see, one of the marvelous      benefits of knitting is that it can be practiced anywhere      and anytime a person has a few spare minutes. Who hasn't      envied a needle clicker during a long, boring town meeting,      political speech, or other obligatory function? That      person's twiddling up something useful while many other      folks are twiddling only their thumbs!<br />      <br />      Crocheting (the needle-arts cousin of knitting) has      delighted advocates, too. Some folks prefer crocheting,      because it is faster than knitting . . . and, since it      involves using only one needle, it is a bit easier to      learn. (Many wise craftspersons learn both arts and then      are able to employ whichever one is appropriate for the      project they're undertaking.)<br />      <br />      So draw a good light close by your favorite easy chair,      throw another log on the fire, and lean back and dig into      this mini-manual. For the price of a few hours of your time      and a few dollars for the basic supplies, you can have a      rewarding pastime to enrich the rest of your life.    </p>
