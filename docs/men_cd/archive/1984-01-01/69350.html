                    <p><em>      Why fire up the gas or electric range when the trusty old      woodburner is waiting-warm and ready-to      serve your wintertime cooking needs?</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Deborah Dunn    </h5>        <p>      Over the past several winters, I've come up with quite a      number of homegrown recipes designed especially for fixing      on a wood heater. Three of them have become family      favorites, and I'd like to share this trio of woodburner      meal maps-one for each of the day's three      repasts-with you. (Mind you, I prepare these dishes      oil my trusty old wood cookstove, but they call also be      done tip on the top of any well-fired box-type wood-heating      stove . . . if you're willing to experiment until you hit      upon the correct time-and-temperature combinations.)<br />      <br />      These through-the-day meals are sure to delight the hungry      mouths around <em>your</em> house, too. So slide that      simmering teapot to the back of the stove, grab your      ingredients, and let's get cooking!<br />      <br />      <strong>FROSTY-MORNING PANCAKES</strong><br />      <br />      1-1/2 cups of whole wheat or unbleached flour<br />      1/2 teaspoon of-salt<br />      2 teaspoons of baking soda<br />      1 teaspoon of cinnamon<br />      1-1/2 cups of milk or fruit juice<br />      3 tablespoons of honey<br />      2 eggs<br />      1/4 cup of cooking oil<br />      1 apple, peeled arid chopped<br />      3 tablespoons of sunflower seeds<br />      <br />      In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking soda, and      cinnamon. Blend the milk or juice, honey, eggs, and oil in      a separate container. Stir the wet and dry mixtures      together, arid add the chopped apple and the sunflower      seeds.<br />      <br />      Now, set a heavy skillet or griddle oil a medium-hot stove      top. When a drop of water will dance oil the heated surface      and then evaporate quickly, you're ready to start cooking.      Coat the bottom of the pan or griddle with cooking oil,      arid pour in a large spoonful of your mix. Fry each cake      until its edges are slightly dry arid its top bubbles, then      flip it over to cook the other side. (For best results, use      a large spatula and turn the cakes only once.)<br />      <br />      Serve your pancakes topped with butter and maple syrup . .      . or make your own sweet sauce by adding hot water to a jar      of homemade preserves until the concoction reaches a      syruplike consistency.<br />      <br />      <strong>LUNCHTIME HOT RICE SALAD</strong><br />      <br />      2 cups of water<br />      3 tablespoons of tamari<br />      1 bay leaf<br />      3 tablespoons of butter<br />      1 cup of brown rice<br />      1 onion, chopped<br />      1/2 green pepper, chopped<br />      1/2 cup of chopped tomato<br />      Parmesan cheese<br />      <br />      Bring the water to a boil. Add the tamari, bay leaf, 2      tablespoons of butter, arid the rice. Let the seasoned mix      boil vigorously for 5 minutes before moving it to a cooler      place tin the stove-or placing it on a trivet-to cook      slowly for approximately 40 minutes. Just before the rice      is done, saut√© the chopped onion arid pepper in a      tablespoon of butter over medium heat until they become      limp. Add tile cooked vegetables and the chopped raw tomato      to the rice . . . sprinkle individual portions with      Parmesan cheese to suit your taste . . . and serve the dish      with a bread of your choice.<br />      <br />      <strong>CHINESE STIR-FRIED VEGETABLE DINNER</strong><br />      <br />      For this treat, you'll need to proportion tile following;      ingredients to the number of servings you wish to prepare .      . . about 1 to 2 cups per person, depending oil the      appetites around your house:<br />      <br />      carrots<br />      broccoli<br />      squash<br />      spring onions<br />      Spanish onions<br />      celery<br />      green pepper<br />      cauliflower<br />      mushrooms<br />      almonds<br />      green peas<br />      <br />      Now, combine these spices, rubbing them with your fingers      to blend theme and bring out their flavors:<br />      <br />      1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg<br />      1/4 teaspoon of coriander<br />      1/4 teaspoon of cardamon<br />      1/4 teaspoon of ginger<br />      1/2 teaspoon of sage<br />      1/2 teaspoon of granulated garlic<br />      1/2 teaspoon of basil<br />      1/2 teaspoon of celery seed<br />      1 teaspoon of cumin<br />      <br />      Set the spices aside. Slice the vegetables, not including      the peas, thinly and toss them gently. Next, chop the      almonds lengthwise (you may also want to toast them in a      hot oven for 10 minutes). Then precook the peas in a pot of      water until they're just tender.<br />      <br />      Once you've completed these preparatory steps, pour 1/4 cup      of sesame or peanut oil per serving into a cast-iron      skillet and place the pan on the stove. When the oil is      good and hot (you'll know it's ready if an onion slice will      start sizzling as soon as it's dropped in), add all the      vegetables except the peas. Cook these fixings for 5      minutes, stirring constantly, and then sprinkle on the      blended spices. (Start with a healthy pinch per serving,      adding more as you like.)<br />      <br />      When everything's cooked to your satisfaction, it's time to      eat. Top each helping with a spoonful of almonds and cooked      peas. You may also want to serve the meal with brown rice      or noodles, and to put tamari or soy sauce on the      table.<br />      <br />      <em>EDIT'OR'S NOTE: For an excellent guide to buying,      installing, caring )or, and using 4 wood      cookstove-complete with scores of taste-tempting      recipes-consider Jane Cooper's 208-page book,      Woodstove Cookery: At Home on the Range.
