                    <p>      THOUGHTS ON THE DESIGN OF A SANE WORLD: PART      I</p>        <p><em>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us-for      instance-have read Paul's book The Population Bomb),      few people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (the type that tends to be      published only in technical journals and college texts).      That's why we're pleased to present this regular      semi-technical column by these well-known      authors/ecologists/educators.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Anne and Paul Ehrlich</h5><p>      "Ecologists," Aldo Leopold once said, "live in a world of      wounds that thinks itself whole." That remark, however, no      longer holds true. Everywhere there seems to be a ground      swell of public opinion reflecting the realization that the      world is badly-perhaps <em>mortally</em>      -wounded. Indeed, it would be fair to say that no      sensible human being today could look at the prospects for      our civilization, or even our species, without a sense of      foreboding.<br />      <br />      The first biennial "Conference on the Fate of the Earth"      was convened in New York City in 1982 in recognition of the      deep and complex interrelationship between the two greatest      threats to the persistence of society: war and      environmental destruction. These two forces share roots in      the cultural traditions, economic behavior, and      technological advances of Western civilization. Indeed,      both trace back to the Agricultural Revolution, which some      extraterrestrial historian may eventually decide was the      first and last big mistake of <em>Homo</em>      <em>Sapiens</em> . It was, after all, that revolution that      led to cities, kings, empires, science, industry, the      population explosion, the emergence of humankind as a      global force, and the development of hydrogen bombs. The      insanity of the modern world can be traced almost directly      to the dissolution of the saner world of hunters and      gatherers 10,000 or so years ago.<br />      <br />      Agriculture today is obviously a major source of      environmental deterioration, and in turn is hurt by it.      Soil erosion, salinization, desertification, and air      pollution all work to reduce crop yields, increase hunger,      and exacerbate the tensions that can lead to wars.      And-to look at the other danger addressed by the      Conference on the Fate of the Earth-while it's clear      that the environmental impacts of "conventional" wars such      as the one in Vietnam have been horrendous, the impact of a      thermonuclear war would be immeasurably worse.<br />      <br />      <strong>GROWTH, GREED, AND POWER</strong><br />      <br />      A fundamental cause of both current threats to humanity can      be seen in the limitless growth-greed-power syndrome that's      so basic to society today. Not only do people strive to      conquer each other . . . they strive to conquer nature      itself. The result is a world in which a wealthy minority      attempts to get even richer . . . while the condition of      the poor majority barely improves, remains static, or      worsens.<br />      <br />      It's a world in which our civilization is held hostage by a      thermonuclear arsenal capable of destroying it (see "After      Nuclear War", MOTHER NO. 84, page 140) . . . an arsenal      that's likely to be detonated by what, in historical      perspective, can only be viewed as the most trivial of      political differences.<br />      <br />      Consider, for example, what would have happened if the      Romans in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. had been      capable of blowing up the world. At that time, the Roman      Empire was a considerably older entity than is either the      United States or the Soviet Union today. And by the "better      dead than red" standards some people preach nowadays, the      Romans would have been completely justified in ending the      world if such an action would have prevented a barbarian      takeover! Can there be any more insane view than that the      political and economic differences between the United      States and the Soviet Union are worth canceling posterity      for?<br />      <br />      Few would disagree that finding a way back to a rational      world must now be at the top of the human agenda. But there      has been little broad-based discussion of what such a world      would look like. Here and in our next two columns, we'll      present some thoughts on that world and make suggestions      about paths that might lead to it.<br />      <br />      <strong>FREEDOM, EQUALITY,<br />      AND CHANGE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Let's start by laying out some personal assumptions. We      believe that, in any foreseeable future, the tensions      between individual freedom and necessary restrictions on it      will persist. There's clearly a continuum between living in      total freedom and having one's behavior totally constrained      by society. Neither extreme is found in any society, human      or animal . . . and a moment's reflection will show that,      by definition, it would be impossible to have a "society"      in which there were no restrictions on individual behavior.      The realistic question is, Where on the continuum between      the impossible extremes should-or can-a society      lie? It's our assumption that most human beings would like      the maximum amount of freedom that is possible within      constraints that still provide a secure existence.<br />      <br />      Similarly, the tensions between equity and inequity will      also continue. Absolute equality-or equality of      <em>opportunity</em> -for individuals is not found      anywhere on the globe. For a genetically variable species      such as ours, which lives in a vast array of different      habitats, what absolute equality might be cannot be      specified even in theory. Nonetheless, we assume that most      people would prefer societies in which there's a higher      degree of equity-that is, <em>fairness</em> in its      broadest sense-than is presently found in, say,      Soviet or American society.<br />      <br />      We also assume that citizens of a sane world would not      operate from sets of fixed "answers" for their problems.      Continuous change is a feature of the universe: the solar      system, the geology of our planet, and all living systems.      In a constantly changing world, people naturally have      attempted to find or invent absolutes: religious faiths,      political creeds, scientific dogmas, and a myriad of other      constructs that can, if simplistically interpreted, be used      to eliminate any flexibility of thinking. It would be      fatuous to assume that such grasping for certainty would      ultimately disappear, but it's reasonable to hope that it      could play a smaller role in organizing and governing a      sane world. More people would accept the omnipresence of      uncertainty in life and learn to deal with it, rather than      deny it.<br />      <br />      Finally, the sane world we are about to describe is not      utopian. Not all misery, inequity, and conflict are      banished from it. Creating such a society is clearly not      possible on a time scale of interest to those living today.      Rational people are not always happy . . . neither would      everyone be in a sane world. But reasonable people and      societies are not self-destructive, either. In the next few      decades, therefore, humanity's task is to move toward a      world in which the major trends do not lead to lives of      want, hopelessness, and degradation for the vast majority      of <em>Homo</em> <em>sapiens.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>ZEROING IN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Let's now look at some of the major features of a sane      world:<br />      <br />      It would be free of war. We purposely say "free of war" and      not "free of nuclear war". In our view, nations have no      choice but to forego military force as a way of resolving      international disputes. There are several reasons for this.      First of all, it's already clear that, in the      not-too-distant future, virtually all nations who want      nuclear arms will be equipped with them . . . and most      industrial nations will have thermonuclear arms. Soon      enough, all wars, to say nothing of revolutions, will have      the potential to become nuclear conflicts. Even if there      were full nuclear disarmament, the knowledge of how to make      nuclear weapons could never be expunged . . . and in case      of war, nuclear arms could be quickly recreated.<br />      <br />      Second, although thermonuclear weapons are by far the most      destructive ones currently in the human arsenal, both      biological and chemical arms have the potential for      becoming very nearly as deadly.<br />      <br />      Third, although it has not been widely noted, the      destructive power of "conventional" weapons has increased      enormously since World War II. This destructive capability      alone makes doubtful whether conflicts between nations with      well-equipped non-nuclear forces could possibly lead to      large enough advantages for either nation to compensate for      the damage done. In short, it seems more and more apparent      that future wars <em>of all sorts</em> will produce no      winners . . . only losers.<br />      <br />      The suppression of war, therefore, must be the first      priority in a sane world, since virtually all wars carry      the risk of escalation both in weapons used and areas      involved. And it's crystal clear that another full-scale      world war would almost surely end civilization, and      possibly threaten the survival of humankind itself.<br />      <br />      <em>A sane world must have a smaller human population.</em>      If war is to be suppressed and our options are to be      maximized, the human population must be well below the      long-term carrying capacity of Earth. Efforts to support      today's population, which has reached 4-2/3 billion, are      steadily eroding that carrying capacity. Loss of biological      resources, erosion of soils, depletion of freshwater      supplies, desertification, and so on are all, at least in      part, caused by burgeoning numbers of people seeking      increased levels of affluence. Earth is already badly      overpopulated. With present and foreseeable technologies, a      sustainable global population must be substantially smaller      than today's: possibly a billion people . . . or even      fewer.<br />      <br />      Determining the exact number now, however, is not      important. There will be ample time to decide what the      optimum size should be, because halting population growth      and gradually reducing the numbers of <em>Homo sapiens</em>      (by keeping birthrates slightly below death rates) will      take several centuries. Eventually, though, humanity can      reach a prudent population level. Among other things,      society must be designed so that the population size      multiplied by the average level of affluence, with that in      turn multiplied by the per capita environmental effects of      the technologies that supply that prosperity, does not      result in environmental impacts that lead to a continuous      decline in Earth's carrying capacity.    </p>    <p>      Some of these ideas were initially presented in a speech to      the first biennial "Conference on the Fate of the Earth" in      New York City in October 1982. Look for Part II of this      discussion in MOTHER NO. 86.    </p>    <p>      <em>The Ehrlichs' work is supported in part by a grant from      the Koret Foundation of San Francisco.</em>    </p>
