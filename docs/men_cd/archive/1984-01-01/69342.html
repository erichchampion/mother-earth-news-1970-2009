                <p>      This enterprising nurse/mother traded her hectic hospital      job for . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Faith Williams    </h5>    <p>      When my husband took on the commitment of building our      house, I had to abandon full-time mothering and bring home      the paycheck . . . by returning to my prior work as a      registered nurse. At first I thought I'd enjoy the old      camaraderie and excitement of the hospital routine. But I      soon found out that-the second time around-all      the activity was more of a hassle than a stimulant. Worse      yet, I could never stop worrying about what might be      happening to my three-year-old son back at home.<br />      <br />      Before long, I decided I was going to have to figure out a      way to earn money and be at <em>home</em> myself! I didn't      want to give up caring for people (the one aspect of      nursing I'd always enjoyed) . . . and when I thought about      it, I realized I didn't have to. After all, there were      plenty of senior citizens in our part of Florida who      needed-but couldn't always afford-nursing help.      So why not care for such an elderly client in my own      home?<br />      <br />      Once my husband and I had discussed the pros and cons of my      brainstorm, he agreed that it seemed like the perfect      solution to my problem. So I got our landlady's approval .      . . fixed up a room for our prospective boarder . . . and      put an ad in the local paper, stating that I was a      qualified R.N. looking for a house patient.    </p>    <p>      <strong>READY RESPONSE</strong>    </p>    <p>      I had a specific type of person in mind to care for: a      grandfather figure who needed help with dressing, bathing,      and other basic care. So when the responses to my ad      started coming in, it didn't take me long-after      carefully reviewing each applicant's problems and      needs-to accept a gentleman in his late 70's with a      premature-senility disease. He'd previously been living in      an expensive nursing home, but his wife could no longer      afford its rates. Consequently, she was so delighted that I      was going to caretake her husband that, on top of my $1,200      monthly fee (home-care providers in my area charge from      $500 to $1,800 a month, depending on the services      provided), she agreed to supply the linen and a hospital      bed with side rails!<br />      <br />      During his first few months with us, "D" (as I'll refer to      our elderly client) improved tremendously. Every day he      grew more active and alert. Whereas he couldn't stand      without assistance before, he soon was able to roam hither      and yon. And with the help of my good home cooking (which      sure beat the bland rest-home fare he was used to), he      gained ten pounds!<br />      <br />      All in all, D's care requires one and a half to two hours a      day. This includes bathing, shaving, and dressing . . .      taking him for walks . . . and cleaning his room. (I don't      count doing D's cooking and laundry in this estimate, since      I have to do those chores for my own family anyway.) Of      course, someone always has to be home should he need help,      so when I have to go to the store or run errands, my      husband-who works right next door on our      house-checks in on him. And when we all want to get      away as a family, I make arrangements for a neighbor to      stay with D while we're gone. (I baby-sit her children in      exchange.)<br />      <br />      One of the most touching aspects of having D with us is the      friendship that's been kindled between him and my little      boy. My son-who rarely gets a chance to be with his      grandparents-enjoys helping me take D on walks.      Despite the gap in their ages (or maybe because of it!),      the two fellows have developed a special understanding of      and warmth for each other. I think each has helped to fill      a void in the other's life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME</strong>    </p>    <p>      Four months after I took up home nursing, my landlady      approached me with another in-house employment opportunity.      A doctor she knew needed help with his billing and wondered      if I'd be interested in working for him. (Of course I      would!) After I spoke with him, I took the part-time job at      $200 a week . . . which included a brand-new typewriter,      desk, office supplies, and the promise of a $25-per-week      raise after six months. This additional money brought my      total at-home income up to a comfortable $500 a week!<br />      <br />      The new job hasn't compromised the care D receives, either.      I just fit the billing work in around his schedule . . .      during the evening or any slack time in the day.<br />      <br />      So, all things considered, I'm doing pretty well for my      family-and for myself!-by working at home. Not      only can I provide a more-than-adequate income for my      household (while being able to monitor my son's activities      to my heart's content!), but I even have a bit of free time      for leisure activities-such as reading-that I      never could manage when I ran the household after those      grueling eight-hour hospital shifts!    </p>
