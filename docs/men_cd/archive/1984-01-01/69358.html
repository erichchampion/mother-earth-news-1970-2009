                    <p>      <em>The cow's in labor . . . nothing's coming out . . . and      you can't reach the vet. Now what?</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Randy Kidd (and MOTHER's staff')    </h5>        <p>      One of the most exciting times in any homesteader's year is      the day the animal babies come. Unfortunately, if something      goes wrong and a creature is lost during parturition, one's      elation quickly turns to sorrow. True, birthing mishaps are      rare (in her infinite wisdom, Mother Nature very seldom      slips up in such matters) . . . but they <em>do</em> occur.      If you're a small-scale livestock breeder, then, you need      to be informed about and prepared for the big event. That      way, you'll know what's going on during parturition, so you      can determine <em>if</em> and when your critter needs      help.<br />      <br />      Mind you, if you're an inexperienced birth attendant, any      emergency assistance you offer should consist of one simple      step: <em>Call the vet!</em> I do not recommend taking on      unfaced obstetrical difficulties yourself unless you have      to. Still, one day you just might be in a situation where      you can't reach the vet . . . in which case the fate of the      mother and baby may rest solely in your-and the good      Lord's-hands.<br />      <br />      Now I don't presume to be able to unfurl all the mysteries      of birth to you in one article. But at least I can give you      a basic idea of what to expect when things are going well      in the "labor room" and what to do about them when they're      not. For simplicity's sake, I'm only going to deal here      with the common long-legged, hoofed beasts (cows, goats,      sheep, and horses), since these animals generally deliver      their young, singly or in pairs, in pretty much the same      manner.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PREPPING</strong>    </p>        <p>      No matter how much you read about animal birthings,      firsthand observation and experience are ultimately going      to prove to be your best sources of information on the      subject. For this reason, I recommend that-if you're      new to livestock midwifery-you [1] get out and      observe the births of some of your neighbors' animals, [2]      make certain someone with lots of critter know-how is by      your side during the first few birthing days of your own      stock, and [3] alert your vet to the pregnant animal's due      date, and have the doc's number always at hand in case you      need help for the baby's debut.<br />      <br />      As the critical time nears, you'll want to make up a large      labor room with plenty of fresh bedding, clean water, and      tempting feed for Mama. Naturally, creating such a space      doesn't guarantee that the mother's going to use it (as the      accompanying sidebar illustrates!), so you might want to      pen her up a few days before she's due. This practice will      provide the mother-to-be with a bit of luxury and will      enable you to keep an eye on her, in the event that she      gives birth early. Check on her several times a day, from      an unobtrusive location (a hayloft or another stall) where      you won't disturb her.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NORMAL PARTURITION</strong>    </p>    <p>      OK, you've done everything you can to prepare for the      event, and suddenly Mama shows definite signs of      approaching delivery: She acts irritable, loses her      appetite, paces about with an air of anticipation,      constantly looks back at her swollen belly . . . or      <em>all</em> of the above. And, when you look closely at      the area around her birth canal, you see that the muscles      have become very relaxed and almost jellylike.<br />      <br />      Yep, chances are good that Junior is on the way! What do      you do now? At first . . . <em>nothing</em> . Just relax      and let nature take its course. Remember, most births      happen without a hitch. And if you're overanxious, Mama      could get jittery too, which might <em>create</em>      problems. So stay calm.<br />      <br />      Once the mother's water has broken, you should see the      first signs of life poking through the birth canal. If      everything's going normally, the baby's front hooves will      appear first, followed by its head . . . which will be      tucked down between its knees (see Fig. 1). The youngster      will seem to be div ing into the world.<br />      <br />      Of the animals mentioned, the horse is the most efficient      at delivering (with about a 95% success rate), usually      producing its young within approximately 15 minutes after      the water breaks. Because equines are so quick about      parturition (and because they tend to give birth during the      night, when it's quiet), it's fairly rare to observe a      foaling. On the other hand, cows, goats, and sheep are a      lot slower about delivering their offspring, usually taking      an hour for the process . . . and sometimes as many as two.      Be patient with such a "slow" Mama as she strains: As long      as you can detect continuous progress (no matter how      plodding), you can assume that all is well. Also, don't be      too alarmed if the birthing mother is pretty nonchalant      about the whole business. It's not uncommon for a mare or      cow to lie down . . . start giving birth ... calmly stand      up with Baby half in and half out . . . munch some hay . .      . and <em>finally</em> (when good and ready) push junior on      out the rest of the way!    </p>        <p>      Most times, the process will go smoothly. All that's left      for you to do is to paint the baby's navel with a potent      iodine solution, make sure the youngster gets a good dose      of colostrum (the mother's first vitamin-rich milk) . . .      and burn or otherwise dispose of the afterbirth. With      horses, this is usually expelled within an hour after      delivery. With other animals, it can take as long as 12      hours after parturition.<br />      <br />      <strong>ABNORMAL PARTURITION</strong><br />      <br />      Your best barometer for determining if and when the mother      animal needs help is time. Say you've got a mare that's      been in hard labor for 20 minutes without producing any      visible results. Well, you know that it should take her      only around 15 minutes to produce a foal, right? Therefore,      you can assume that you've probably got trouble on your      hands. Likewise, a cow, goat, or sheep that's not beginning      to deliver after an hour or so of straining may well need      assistance. <em>In no</em> <em>case should you leave an      expectant animal in labor without help for more than three      hours!</em><br />      <br />      As I said before, your veterinarian is the preferred      obstetrician in time of trouble. But if-for whatever      reason-a doc isn't available, you're going to have to      take charge. Just take a deep breath, stay calm, and move      slowly and carefully: A nervous nurse only makes things      worse. First, find an assistant to hold the struggling      mother for you. Then scrub up (that includes hands and      arms!), and also wash off the area around the animal's      birth canal to insure that everything is as sanitary as      possible.<br />      <br />      Next, lubricate your hands and arms with mineral oil or      petroleum jelly, and gradually slide an arm through the      animal's vulva to feel about, so that you can estimate what      you're dealing with. You may have to wait until the mother      relaxes her contractions, but be patient: She will, and      pretty soon you'll be in touch with the fetus. Now, you'll      have to figure out what you've got hold of by visualizing      what the youngster looks like as you feel it.<br />      <br />      Of course, most of us can tell the difference between a      head and a rump, but you're more likely to encounter a leg      before you come upon a face or a tail. To find out whether      you've found a front or a back hoof, slide your hand up the      limb you've got hold of until you get to the two leg      joints. If both joints bend in the same direction, you've      got a front leg. If they bend in opposite directions,      you've got a hind one. In either case, reach all the way up      the leg and find its mate to ascertain that both are      attached to the same animal: It could be twins, you      know!<br />      <br />      Many births are held up by a front leg that's bent backward      (see Fig. 2). This situation is fairly simple to correct.      Just flex the shoulder, elbow, and knee joints of the tardy      leg and slowly rotate the limb until it's alongside Baby's      head and aimed forward. Should both legs be tucked (as in      Fig. 3), bring one forward in the described manner and then      the other, making certain to tuck the head down between      them in the diving position when you're done. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: Some folks prefer to use a rope or obstetrical chain      to reposition a slippery youngster in the womb. However,      unless you really know what you're doing with these      devices, you could wind up doing more damage than good. For      instance, it's not uncommon to pull a hoof</em> <em>off      with a badly placed, too-tight rope.]</em><br />      <br />      Another possible difficulty is that the baby's head may be      bent backward (see Fig. 4). Solving this problem can be      fairly tricky, so be very careful. In order to bring the      head forward, you may have to push the baby <em>away</em>      from the birth canal and toward the front of the uterus. To      do this, wait until the mother relaxes her contractions      before gently pushing against the youngster's chest. Then      carefully pull the head down and forward, finally securing      it between the forelegs.<br />      <br />      Besides "molding" the soon-to-be-born offspring into the      diving position, you may actually have to help the      exhausted mother give birth. If so, get a good grip on the      baby and-following the mother's      contractions-pull down when she strains and ease up      when she relaxes. Notice that I said pull <em>down</em> . .      . not out! (That's because the birth canal points in a      downward direction.) Be patient, taking all your cues from      the mother, no matter how slow she is. The baby has enough      problems without your yanking it about unnecessarily.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BREECH BIRTHS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Breech births-backward entries into the      world-are pretty common . . . and are also fairly      dangerous if you don't know what to watch out for (see      Figs. 5 and 6). The main problem with this back-feet-first      delivery is that sometimes Baby doesn't get enough oxygen.      Naturally, as long as the youngster's attached to an      untangled umbilical cord, it'll be fine. And don't worry:      Most of the time, the cord won't snap or snag until the new      arrival is well onto the ground. However, since the      animal's head comes out after practically everything else,      its nostrils have more opportunity to get clogged with      mucus and afterbirth. Therefore, what you do need to worry      about is making sure that you clean of the newborn's face      and nose as soon as you can. (You may also want to give the      young' un a good breath-stimulating rubdown as an added      precaution.) In a breech birth, make certain that Baby's      hind legs are straight out behind it prior to delivery. If      they're not, apply the same techniques you'd use with front      legs to get them in a good womb-exiting position.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TWINS</strong>    </p>    <p>      I won't say much about double packages (see Fig. 7),      because the problems involved are pretty much the same as      those in solo births. Actually, since twins are generally      smaller than singles, they're much easier to work with if      you do need to intervene . . . but you should work on only      one baby at a time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINISHING TOUCHES</strong>    </p>    <p>      The vast majority of times, of course, you'll "walk      through" a birth-assist, and-almost before you know      it-a lovely youngster will be looking up wonderingly      at you. Don't forget to paint the newborn's navel with      iodine, and see to it that the baby gets a big gulp of      colostrum. Dispose of the afterbirth, too. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: If a mare doesn't expel the afterbirth within six      hours after delivery, you'd better call the vet. The same      holds true if a cow, sheep, or goat hasn't gotten rid of it      after 24 hours.]</em><br />      <br />      After an abnormal parturition, the mother may be too worn      out to tend to her little one, so you may have to clean the      baby off-all over-for her. Afterward, give the      new family a clean bed of straw or shavings to lie on, and      provide a tempting laxative of bran and/or coarse hay for      the mother.<br />      <br />      Once you're sure they're comfortable and well taken care      of, you can amble on back to the house for a nice cup of      tea to calm your nerves, or you can do as I do: Settle down      on a bale of hay and watch the first life exploring antics      of the brand-new creature you've just helped bring into the      world.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Here are some sources of general information      on methods of livestock care that would-be animal midwives      may find helpful: The Family Cow by Dirk van Loon (Garden      Way, $8.95), Backyard Livestock by Steven Thomas      (Countryman Press, $7.95), Raising Milk Goats the Modern      Way by Jerry Belanger (Garden Way, $5.95), Raising Sheep      the Modern Way by Paula Simmons (Garden Way, $7.95), and      Raising Goats: The Backyard Dairy Alternative by David B.
