                    <p>      <em>Presenting Our Environmental Hall of Fame inductee for      1983:</em>    </p>        <p>      In the past two issues of this magazine, we introduced the      first 13 members of our Environmental Hall of Fame . . .      one for each year of MOTHER's existence. They were (in case      you missed them) john James Audubon . . . Henry David      Thoreau . . . John Muir . . . Theodore Roosevelt . . .      Rachel Carson . . . David Ross Brower . . . Jerome Irving      Rodale . . . Aldo Leopold . . . Jacques-Yves Cousteau . . .      Barbara Ward . . . Sir Albert Howard . . . Ren√©      Jules Dubos . . . and Anwar Fazal.    </p>    <p>      <em>Now, at last, we have the privilege of introducing our      first annual selection, the inductee for 1983: Richard St.      Barbe Baker.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Living from 1889 to 1982, Richard St. Barbe Baker was a      professional forester, author, lecturer, and      conservationist. The man truly dedicated his life to      planting trees: He saw more than 26 trillion of them      seeded! This and other aspects of his work took him across      the world. St. Barbe spent years working in Africa and New      Zealand . . . initiated the "Save the Redwoods" campaign in      California . . . directed the Sahara Reclamation Program .      . . founded the World Forestry Charter Gatherings and the      Men of the Trees society . . . and organized forestry      summer schools at many universities.</em>    </p>    <p>      In his writings, St. Barbe shares with us an intellectual      philosophy and a deep spiritual vision. His books include I      Planted Trees, Green Glory, Africa Drums, Famous Trees,      Trees, Book of the Seasons, Among the Trees, Dance of the      Trees, The Redwoods, Sahara Challenge, Land of Tane , and      Sahara Conquest . The following short      excerpts-reprinted with permission of the Lorian      Association-are from St. Barbe's autobiography, My      Life, My Trees , which was published in 1970.    </p>    <p>      I learned early to regard the forest as a society of living      things, the greatest of which is the tree. Its value      depends upon its permanence, its capacity to renew itself,      to store water, its many biological functions including      that of providing Nature's most valuable ground cover, and      building up to a great height stores of one of the most      adaptable of raw materials: wood.<br />      <br />      We stand in awe and wonder at the beauty of a single tree.      Tall and graceful it stands, yet robust and sinewy with      spreading arms decked with foliage that changes through the      seasons, hour by hour, moment by moment as shadows pass or      sunshine dapples the leaves. How much more deeply are we      moved as we begin to appreciate the combined operations of      the assembly of trees we call a forest.<br />      <br />      As long as a soil is covered with forest, its humus is      maintained. The basic forest problem lies in its      composition and regeneration. In the forest the processes      of decay and growth always balance one another. The      vegetable wastes together with the by-products of the      animal population form a mixture on the forest floor. As we      examine this mixture from time to time we find it remains      practically constant in depth, in spite of annual additions      from leaf-fall that take place. This mixture is drawn upon      at an even rate by earthworms, fungi, and bacteria, and the      resulting humus in turn is absorbed by the soil and      provides the trees and undergrowth with the food materials      they require. Thus the forest manures itself and with the      help of the earthworms and other animals distributes this      manure through the upper layers of the soil. Everything is      done by Nature quietly and efficiently. No artificial      fertilizers, no selective weed-killers, no pesticides, and      no machinery are needed in the household of the natural      forest.<br />      <br />      In that vast evergreen forest Nature works in perfect      rhythm; roots digging deep or exploring nearer the surface      for food and moisture. Imperceptibly Nature builds those      mighty pillars with aisles innumerable, arches multiplex,      in the cathedral of the forest.<br />      <br />      A teeming life goes on in the forest without any of the      problems that confront mankind in similar circumstances.      There are no dustbins to empty, no water-borne sewage, no      town clerks or city councillors or armies of officials,      with more and more rates to pay, no ever-growing burden of      debt.<br />      <br />      The forest solves its own sanitary problems by direct      action while man evades them. The forest has been described      as the perfect sanitarian, the supreme chemist. In its      economy it perfectly combines Capitalism, Communism, and      Social Credit and instead of building up a burden of debt      it stores up real wealth-the wealth of the woods. As Henry      van Dyke so aptly put it:<br />      <br />      <em>In the wealth of the woods since the world began The      trees have offered their gifts to man.</em><br />      <br />      The Ancients believed that the earth was a sentient being      and responded to the behavior of man upon it. As we have no      scientific proof to the contrary, should we not accept this      point of view and behave accordingly?<br />      <br />      I look at it like this: If a man loses one-third of his      skin he dies; the plastic surgeons say, "He's had it." If a      tree loses one-third of its bark it dies. This has been      proved scientifically by botanists and dendrologists. Would      it not be reasonable to suggest that if the earth loses      more than a third of its green mantle and tree cover, it      will assuredly die? The water table will sink beyond recall      and life will become impossible.<br />      <br />      Under existing systems food looms large and there is a      constant threat of famine over wide areas, but if we treat      reforestation as seriously as we do national defense, and      turn from an animal economy to a sylvan one, we shall be      able to look forward confidently to the time when food will      worry us as little as the air we breathe. Indeed, when we      have every man under his own vine and fig tree in a perfect      earth, beautified by complete landscape husbandry, then      with St. Francis of Assisi we shall be able to say:<br />      <br />      "Praise be, my Lord, for our Sister, Mother Earth, which      does sustain and keep us and bringeth forth diverse fruits      and flowers of many colors and grass."    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: My Life, My Trees is available for $6.95      (include an additional 70c for shipping and handling) from      the Lorian Association, Dept.
