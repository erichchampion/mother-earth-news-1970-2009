                    <p>      <em>This built for-a-tight-budget project works a lot      better than it looks!</em>    </p>    <p>      For most of us, establishing an effective home workshop is      a matter of patiently purchasing equipment over a long      period of time. True, new hand tools can ordinarily be      acquired quickly, but larger, table-mounted machines are      enough of an investment to send the amateur craftsperson      off to garage sales in desperate quest of a secondhand      bargain.<br />      <br />      Consider the wood lathe: The basic models cost more than      $300, and even a used piece of equipment commands nearly      that price . . . yet the tool is so versatile that it's      usually one of the first to find a place in the serious      wood shop. Fortunately, a garden-variety      lathe-without a lot of fancy features-is such a      perfect example of straightforward design that an amateur      toolsmith ought to be able to assemble a bargain-basement      duplicate all on his or her own. To prove just this point,      MOTHER'S researchers Dennis Burkholder and Robyn Bryan      tackled the task and came up with the bare-bones,      low-budget wood lathe you see here.<br />      <br />      <strong>WOOD YOU HAVE GUESSED?</strong><br />      <br />      At first glance, the fellows' rustic interpretation of the      familiar machine tool appears to be little more than a toy.      But a few of our staffers with some woodworking experience      to their credit have put the lathe through a number of      trials, and the consensus is that the timber-framed      woodturner is fully capable of handling most of the basic      shaping and finishing jobs encountered by the casual      crafter . . . at least until he or she can afford a more      conventional machine.<br />      <br />      As you can see from the photos, our budget lathe's bed is      just a length of pressure-treated 4 X 4 supported by two      short 3/4Â·'plywood legs (we recommend treated lumber      for the 4 X 4, because it's generally heavier and truer      than its unprocessed counterpart). The headstock consists      of a bearing mandrel mounted on a 4 X 4 spacer, and the      tailstock is similarly arranged . . . except that its      center is fastened to a threaded-rod ram equipped with a      handwheel. The headstock spindle is driven, through a      V-belt, by a two-speed washing machine motor . . . and the      tool rest is an adjustable framework of slotted steel angle      clamped to the bed.<br />      <br />      Just to see how much the lathe's component parts would come      to if every-thing-excluding the motor, which was a used      one-were bought right off the hardware store's shelves, we      itemized its every piece and came up with a grand total of      $57.16. However, since Dennis and Robyn actually assembled      the tool largely from odds and ends around the shop (a feat      that probably wouldn't be all that difficult to duplicate      in your own workspace), the entire lathe lightened our till      by only $35 or so. Of course, the motor drive-if      purchased new-would run at least $50. But it's easy      to salvage a working unit from a retired clothes washer      instead (ours cost a mere $10).    </p>    <p>      <strong>LAUNDRY-ROOM LARCENY</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you're interested in putting together your own low-buck      lathe, you'll first have to come up with a 1/2-horsepower,      two-speed washing machine motor with a clockwise rotation      (looking at it from the shaft end). Our split-phase model,      taken from a Whirlpool, spins at 1,725 and 1,140      revolutions per minute (RPM), though a similar      <em>reversible</em> motor with dual-speed capability (found      in some Norge, Speed Queen, Whirlpool, Kenmore, and Maytag      washers) would work as well, providing you wired it to spin      in the correct direction. Other major parts you'll need to      acquire are a bearing mandrel with 1/2" arbors . . . a      straight, 6', pressure-treated 4 X 4 . . . and pulleys to      fit the motor and mandrel shafts that will yield a      step-down of between 2/3 and 3/4 speed. (Our 2" motor      pulley drives a 3" mandrel wheel, so our step-down factor      is .666, or 2/3.)<br />      <br />      Once you've collected these key components, you can      scrounge, make, or buy the remaining parts called for in      the list of materials . . . and proceed to assemble the      bed. The 3/4"-plywood legs are simply glued and lag-screwed      to the ends of a 4' section of your 4 X 4, and the motor      base is hinged from beneath the bed in what will be the      lathe's left rear corner. At this point, you can cut what's      left of the 4 X 4 into one 8-1/4" and two 6" lengths, and      glue the longest of those pieces to the top of the bed at      the motor end to serve as a headstock. Two headstock      clamps-made from 314" X 5-1/2" X 7" hunks of      plywood-hold that block to the bed on each      side.<br />      <br />      The bearing mandrel bolts directly into the surface of the      headstock, perfectly parallel to the length of the bed and      in such a way that its tips completely clear the ends of      the stock. With the larger pulley temporarily placed on the      mandrel shaft, you can then position the motor for mounting      by using the angle brackets, smaller pulley, and estimated      belt length as your guides.<br />      <br />      Once the motor's fastened to the hinged platform, it's a      simple matter to select and install a drive belt of the      proper length. Afterward, a small eye-and-eye turnbuckle      can be bolted between the plywood base and the leg below it      to provide incremental adjustment as the drive belt      stretches. But don't just leave it at that: A belt      guard-made from an oblong-cut piece of 1/4" plywood,      with appropriate holes created for the motor and mandrel      shafts-ought to be glued and tacked to the end of the      headstock . . . and a suitable cover (we used a two-liter      plastic soft-drink bottle that was cleaved and then      overlapped in the middle) should be similarly fastened to      the edges of that wooden plate. Finish up the drive system      by shielding the motor with a cardboard cover screwed to      its base . . . wiring its leads through a single-pole,      double-throw toggle switch as shown in the accompanying      schematic . . . and mounting that two-speed control in a      standard switch box hung beneath the bed.<br />      <br />      <strong>A TALL TAIL</strong><br />      <br />      To allow the lathe to accept spindles of varying lengths,      the tailstock must be able to slide along the bed and lock      in any given position. We provided for this by mounting      elongated plywood clamps to the glued together tailstock      blocks and then using a simple bolt-and-wheel to pinch the      bed between those grips. A compression spring sandwiched      inside the cinch and around the bolt pushes the clamps      open, and a simple tension gauge (made from a length of      1/2" dowel attached to one clamp and passed through a hole      in the other) indicates the degree of grip.<br />      <br />      The tailstock ram is nothing more than a 1/2" X 9" section      of threaded rod held to the stock with two 1/4" floor      flanges. We first tapped these mounts to accept the rod's      1/2-20 thread, then bored a 3/4" hole through the 6"-long      upper tailstock block 1-5/16 inches below its top surface      and centered between its two sides. The lower tailstock      block, whose dimensions should be approximately 2-3/8" X      31/2" X 6", dictates the height of the tailstock center,      though the oversized ram hole allows for a lot of fine      adjustment. Of course, your ultimate goal here is to set      the head- and tailstock centers on an equal plane for      accurate turning, so you may have to alter the given      dimensions slightly to match the height of your particular      mandrel's center.<br />      <br />      When the floor flanges are bolted in place over the      tailstock hole with the ram installed, you can attach the      ram lock and handwheel. The lock is a piece of 1/8" flat      stock drilled and tapped to match the threaded rod and      offset to form a convenient handle. The tailstock ram wheel      is, like that of the clamp, just a drive motor motor mounts      motor pulley mandrel pulley drive belt headstock spindle      mandrel fasteners motor base hinges speed control motor      mount fasteners hinge fasteners hinge fasteners V-belt      tensioner turnbuckle fastener turnbuckle fastener motor      base motor cover motor cover fasteners belt guard belt      guard cover bed legs bed leg fasteners headstock clamps      headstock clamp fasteners speed control box speed control      box mount headstock headstock spur center tailstock clamps      tailstock clamp fasteners tailstock (upper) tailstock      (lower) tailstock clamp clincher tailstock clamp spring      tailstock clamp clincher handle tailstock clamp gauge      tailstock clamp gauge head tailstock clamp gauge head      fastener tailstock cup center tailstock ram tailstock ram      lock tailstock ram mounts tailstock ram mount fasteners      tailstock ram handwheel bed tool rest tool rest stanchions      tool rest stanchion fasteners tool rest base (upper) tool      rest base (lower) tool rest base fasteners valve handwheel      red-rilled and given a set of threads. A 1/2" nut torqued      against it prevents it from turning on the ram.<br />      <br />      Any kind of spindle-turning requires spur and cup centers      to hold the work between the head- and tailstocks. We made      inexpensive ones out of pipe couplings and bolts by      crosscutting teeth into one end of a 1/4" pipe coupling,      and rethreading that and an unaltered fitting to accept the      ram and mandrel studs. We then obtained matching bolts      and-after cutting their heads off, slotting their      bodies, and grinding their tips to a point-ran them      through the cores to create both a headstock spur center      able to grip and spin a billet and a tailstock cup center      adequate for holding it in true.<br />      <br />      Faceplate-turning, on the other hand, calls for a      flat-surfaced fitting that screws directly to the end of      the mandrel and is able to hold a work-piece by itself. We      found that various-sized floor flanges that were bushed and      rethreaded to fit the driven shaft served that purpose      well.<br />      <br />      Last but not least, the lathe needs a tool rest. We'll      admit that our simple example could be improved upon      without adding a whole lot of expense to the project . . .      but the elementary rest we settled upon does function well      if it's tightened properly. It's merely a piece of slotted      steel angle that's supported on two 3/4" conduit posts . .      . which in turn are bolted to adjustable clamps fabricated      from unequal lengths of the same perforated material that's      used for the rest itself. Sections of angle iron of a      similar size would also work, but you'd have to drill a      series of holes through their flats to accommodate the      various-sized work-pieces you're likely to encounter while      using the machine. In either case, every metal edge should      be filed smooth to prevent accidental cuts while you're      working or resetting the tool rest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before you "fire up" your assembled unit, remember that,      although this tool only cost about a tenth of what a      commercial model would, its 1/2-horsepower motor makes it      just as powerful. So take the time to bolt its legs      permanently to a solid work platform, and always wear eye      protection (but never loose clothing, belts, or jewelry)      when turning. In addition, make certain that the work      revolves toward you, and check to see that each billet will      clear the bed and tool rest by rotating it once by hand      prior to engaging the motor. (The maximum swing with both      faceplate and spindle turnings is 4-1/2 inches, and the      distance between centers can be up to 30 inches.) Moreover,      always use sharp chisels, and rough out your raw billets at      the slowest speed . . . then switch up to high RPM for      finer work. The speed ratio mentioned earlier will yield      760 and 1,150 RPM with a two-speed motor.<br />      <br />      If you're a wood-turning novice, you'd also do well to      research the craft before cutting (Sears, Roebuck & Co.      markets a book titled <em>Power Tool Know How</em> ,      Catalog No. 9-2918 in their Craftsman line, that covers the      use of many table tools). Even if you're an old hand,      remember to be cautious around your equipment. After all,      <em>common sense</em> is the first tool any craftsperson      should rely upon.    </p>
