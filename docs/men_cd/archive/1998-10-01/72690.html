            		<p>      COUNTRY LORE		</p>				<p>      <strong>What a crock of flowers!</strong>		</p>    		<p>				A crock of flowers always      looks pretty, but where do you find a crock as large as a      barrel without spending a fortune?</p>      <p>      After capturing a 55-gallon plastic barrel from where I      work (a 30-gallon barrel will also do), I brought it home      to turn it into something useful. After cutting the top off      completely, I used a two-inch hole saw to cut 45 holes      around the sides of the barrel.</p>      <p> The barrel was marked off in five rings, evenly spaced apart. To place the first      circular mark around the barrel, measure up about five      inches from the bottom. This is where your first ring of      holes will start.</p>      <p> When drilling the other four rings of      holes, stagger the holes so that they all line up      diagonally. This will make for a more filled out barrel at      maturity (see illustration).</p>      <p> After the holes are completed,      fill the barrel with the dirt of your choice. I bought      professional potting soil from my local greenhouse grower.      I then purchased three colors of begonias and staggered      them to make a striped array of blooms around the barrel.</p>      <p>      Set the barrel on three bricks so that you can turn it      easily once a week to keep foliage growing evenly. By the      end of the summer, the barrel will completely disappear and      you will have a conversation piece everybody will be      talking about.</p>      <p> <em>-Jay Shephard<br />      Candor, NC<br /></em>    </p>
