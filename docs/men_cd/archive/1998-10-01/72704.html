            		<p>			HERBAL REMEDIES    </p>				<p>    <strong>		  Whether it's stress or sore feet      relief may be just a sniff away.		</strong>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">      By Destin√©e-Charisse Royal    </h5>        <p>      Aromatherapy involves the use of essential oils to reduce      stress and promote healing and wellness. According to      practitioners and devotees of the craft, these essential      oils-extracted from the roots, stems, branches, bark,      leaves, fruit, and flowers of various plants-carry      medicinal properties that are activated when massaged into      the skin, inhaled, used in baths, or diffused throughout a      room.</p><p> "Aromatherapy may take a little bit longer to work      [than do Western medicines]," says Carolyn Sajdecki,      lecturer of aromatherapy at the College of DuPage in      Illinois. Its power works quietly, she explains, but the      changes it can bring about are far more lasting-addressing      the root cause of a problem, rather than just masking the      symptoms.</p><p> Sajdecki makes a clear distinction between      cosmetic fragrances and essential oils. A lemon-scented      fragrance, though it may smell like pure lemon essence,      does not have the essential oil's antiseptic and astringent      therapeutic properties. "Aromatherapy is more than just      messing around with pretty smells," she says.</p><p> Aromatherapy      can ease pain, kill bacteria, and cleanse the body of      toxins, say its advocates. Each of the 130 or so varieties      of essential oils used by aromatherapists is believed to      have specific healing properties that can help relieve      life's everyday pressures, stresses, and ailments, from      sore throats and winter colds to more serious problems like      bronchitis, sinusitis, and rheumatism.</p>			<h3>      How It Works</h3>			<p>Aromatherapy relies on the      sophisticated human olfactory system, of which the nose is      but one component, explains author Susanne Fischer-Rizzi in      her <em>Complete Aromatherapy Handbook</em> . The olfactory      bulb, located at the top of the inner nasal cavity      approximately at eye level, is covered with a mucous      membrane about the size of a nickel. Despite its size, the      membrane's structure and function is "nothing short of      miraculous," notes Fischer-Rizzi, who explains: "The      olfactory membrane is the only place in the human body      where the central nervous system is exposed and in direct      contact with the environment ... The hairs attached to the      nerve cells-up to 80 million of them-are capable of      carrying an incomprehensible amount of information, a      capability that outperforms every known analytical human      function."</p><p> With smell the keenest of all senses, humans are      able to discem more than 10,000 odors. Our sense of taste      is paltry by comparison. The tongue is capable of      recognizing only that which is sweet, sour, bitter, or      salty. All other perceived flavors are actually odors.</p><p>      Smell is also closely tied to memory. There is nothing that      can evoke a past time, place, or emotion better than an      aroma.</p><p> Thus, aromatherapists use neuroassociative      conditioning when treating their clients. In this      technique, a fragrant blend of essential oils is used to      massage the client, relieving tension and stress. The blend      must be agreed upon by both aromatherapist and client,      since the therapy won't work if the client doesn't like the      smell of the essential oils. When the client leaves the      session and later uses her personal blend in a bath soak,      spritz bottle, or on the skin as a perfume, her body will      remember the feeling of relaxation experienced when she      fast smelled the blend during the massage session.</p><p> In      addition to massage, people can experience aromatherapeutic      oils in numerous ways-including rubbing diluted      essential oils on the temples, breathing oil-laced fumes      through a steam inhaler, or adding a few drops of an      essential oil to a room humidifier.</p><p> Moreover, many pure      essences have specific pharmacological properties that go      beyond odor For instance, while inhaling the aroma of      frankincense can deepen breathing, the oil or incense      extracted from the tree's gum resin also has      anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antifungal agents.</p>			<h3>A Growing Trend</h3>        <p>      According to the National Association of Holistic      Aromatherapy (NAHA), the last half-decade has seen      tremendous growth in aromatherapy product sales, as      consumers have become increasingly savvy about the healing      powers of essential oils. Currently worth an estimated $300      million a year, the U.S. aromatherapy market is expected to      quadruple in the next five years, predicts NAHA President      Cheryl Hoard.</p><p> As the country's largest nonprofit      educational organization dedicated to aromatherapy, NAHA      took it upon itself a couple of years back to conduct a      nationwide survey on the state of its favorite healing art.      What the organization found is that aromatherapy is big      business for lots of small companies. Despite the      "aromatherapy" sections that have cropped up in numerous      chain retail stores (usually featuring fragrant lotions,      soaps, shampoos, and the like), the real aromatherapy      market-wholesalers and retailers of true essential      oils and related products and services-remains in the      hands of mom and pop, or more likely, just mom. "The growth      of aromatherapy has not been in big business but in the      many burgeoning small companies, predominantly owned by      women, that sell essential oils and essential-oil      products," notes Hoard. "There are over 2,000 businesses      that gross over $100,000 a year, with more opening every      day."</p><p> Why the boom? NAHA pins the popularity of      aromatherapy on, among other things, a growing      disillusionment with today's high-cost health care      industry, combined with consumers' desires to return to a      more natural lifestyle.</p><p> Mindy Green, director of      educational services at the Colorado-based Herb Research      Foundation, concurs. "People today are much more willing      and interested in Liking an active role in their health,"      she says. "They are concerned with prevention, rather than      just waiting to get sick."</p><p> Like Sajdecki, Green sees a real      place for aromatherapy in today's pharmacopoeia, although      both women admit that it and other alternative remedies      should not supplant modem medicine entirely. "Nobody's      saying that if you have a car accident and someone puts a      bottle of chamomile under your nose, everything will be      okay," says Sajdecki. But, says Green, "It's important for      consumers to have a choice ... to know their options."</p><p> When      asked why people should try aromatherapy, Sajdecki's answer      is simple: "It's really pleasant. And it works."</p>			<h3>BOOKS:</h3>			<p> <em>Aromatherapy Massage: The      Complete Illustrated Guide to massaging with Essential      Oils, by Clare Maxwell-Hudson (Dorling Kindersley Limited,      1994)</em></p><p> <em>Complete Aromatherapy Handbook,</em> by      Susanne Fischer-Rizzi (Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 1989)</p><p>      <em>The Fragrant Mind,</em> by V.

There are plenty of books,      articles, stores, companies, and organizations dedicated to      aromatherapy.</p><p> Most essential oils smell best when used in      small amounts; use only the few drops that each recipe      requires.</p><p> Keep essential oils away from children, pets, and      open fire (yes, they're flammable).</p><p> Don't apply oils to the      skin neat (undiluted). Always patch-test new essential      oils.</p><p> Place a diluted drop on inner wrist, apply a      Band-Aid, and check after 12 hours. If there is any      irritation, do not use that essential oil. Avoid the eye      area; if oils do get in the eye, rinse with cool water.</p><p>      Store essential oils in labeled dark glass bottles, in a      cool dark place with nonrubber lids, tightly secured to      prevent evaporation. Ideally, use essential oils within a      year, and within three months if mixed with carrier oils.    </p>    <h3>Soothing Smells for All That Ails</h3>        <p>      It takes 30 roses to produce just one drop of pure rose      essence. Because of their high concentrations, essential      oils are extremely potent and can dry or irritate the skin      if used alone, and so should always be diluted before being      applied.    </p>    <p>      For massage, essential oils are diluted in a carrier oil to      produce what is known as a "personal blend." Choose a      carrier oil that suits your skin type and special needs.      All-purpose carrier oils include apricot kernel oil and      sweet almond oil (good for sensitive skin), soy oil and      grapeseed oil (good for oily skin), and sunflower oil.    </p>    <p>      Add the following special carrier oils to the all-purpose      ones to make longer-lasting, more absorbent blends that are      suitable for treating dry dehydrated skin: carrot oil (add      only 10% to all-purpose carrier oil, since this stuff is      not only pricey, but the orange color can temporarily stain      the skin); sesame oil (use only the oil from uncooked      seed); or avocado oil (rich in vitamins A and B, this      excellent skin softener is good for dry chapped skin).    </p>        <p>      Jojoba, which is not an oil but a wax, can also be added to      the blend to lengthen its shelf life.    </p>    <p>      Mynou deMey, director of the New York-based American      Institute for Aromatherapy and Herbal Studies and the New      York director of the National Association for Holistic      Aromatherapy, suggests the following blends and treatments      for MOTHER readers.    </p>    <h3>Massage Oil Blends</h3>    <p>      To ease stress, mix:<br />      2 drops bergamot (bergaptene-free)<br />      2 drops clary sage<br />      3 drops lavender<br />      1/2 ounce carrier oil<br />      Massage: full body    </p>        <p>      For coughs and colds, mix:    </p>    <p>      2 drops eucalyptus<br />      2 drops frankincense<br />      2 drops roman chamomile ounce carrier oil<br />      Massage: chest and back    </p>    <p>      <em>For PMS and menstrual cramps, mix:</em>    </p>    <p>      2 drops clary sage<br />      2 drops geranium<br />      2 drops sage<br />      1/2 ounce carrier oil<br />      Massage: abdomen    </p>        <p>      For muscle fatigue, mix:    </p>    <p>      3 drops rosemary<br />      2 drops sweet marjoram<br />      1/2 ounce carrier oil<br />      Massage: affected area    </p>    <p>      <em>For constipation, mix:</em>    </p>    <p>      4 drops cardamom<br />      1/2 ounce carrier oil<br />      Massage: abdomen clockwise    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bath</strong>    </p>        <p>      Invigorating bath:    </p>    <p>      3 drops ginger<br />      3 drops rosemary<br />      2 drops juniper berry<br />      I cup whole milk    </p>    <p>      Draw a warm bath and climb in. Add the milk, followed by      the oils, stir, and enjoy. Note: this bath is recommended      for the morning, not the evening. According to deMey, these      essential oils are stimulating to the nervous system.    </p>    <h3>Foot Soak</h3>    <p>      <em>For tired feet:</em><br />      8 cups lukewarm water in foot bath<br />      4 drops peppermint<br />      1cup whole milk    </p>    <h3>Compress</h3>        <p>      <em>For headaches:</em><br />      1 drop sweet marjoram<br />      1 drop peppermint<br />      2 drops lavender cold compress (wet washcloth or      towel)<br />      Keep eyes closed and put compress over forehead and eyes.    </p>    <h3>Steam Tubulation</h3>    <p>      <em>For coughs and colds:</em><br />      4 cups boiling water<br />      2 drops ravensara oil<br />      1drop frankincense    </p>        <p>      Add oils to boiling water in a bowl. Drape a towel over      your head, close your eyes, and lower your face toward the      bowl. The towel shouldn't touch the water but should touch      the edges of the bowl, trapping the steam so that you get      the full benefit of the fumes rising from the boiling      water. Breathe the essential oil-laced fumes for about ten      minutes. Repeat the procedure later in the day.    </p>
