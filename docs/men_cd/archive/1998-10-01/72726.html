                <p>      LAST LAUGH    </p>		        <p>      <strong>Canadian air gives a lift to night crawlers and a      weary job-hunter.</strong>    </p>		    <h5 id="byline">      By Joe Novara    </h5>        <p>      In show business, they call it "being between engagements."      I've heard executives talk about "headhunters beating the      bushes" for them. Me, I was just plain looking for a      job-despite many months spent reading classifieds, scouring      the Internet, sending e-mail and snail mail.    </p>    <p>      It was about that time that I got a postcard from my Uncle      Charlie "Hap" Hazard. He has a cabin up above Sault Ste.      Marie, Canada, six miles east of the Agawa Canyon.    </p>    <p>      "Come on up," was all he wrote.    </p>    <p>      "Why not?" I thought. Maybe I could use a dose of living      close to nature.    </p>    <p>      It was during my first morning at Hap's that I learned      about his sense of time. After breakfast, we began working      on the roof of the cabin. Forty minutes later, we stopped      for coffee and a donut. Forty minutes later, we paused      again. When we had stopped for the fourth time before noon,      I finally confronted my, uncle. "Can't we just work for a      stretch? At this rate, we'll be at it all day."<br />      <br />      "That's the point," Hap allowed. "We're not in a factory,      where work starts and stops by shifts. What good would it      do to work straight through till 4:30 and sit around for      seven hours till bedtime?"    </p>    <p>      Later that evening, after 12 cups of coffee and the same      number of snacks, I hardly had an appetite for Supper. "All      those breaks still feel like a waste of time to me," I      grumbled.    </p>    <p>      "Ha!" Hap practically barked. "You want to save time?" He      worked his lips. He felt a joke coming on, and from past      experience I knew that I could no more stop him than keep      him from sneezing.<br />      <br />      "You remind me of the city slicker who saw a farmer lifting      a pig up to his shoulder so the pig could eat an apple off      the tree.    </p>    <p>      'Excuse me,' the city dweller said. 'Could I make a      suggestion?    </p>    <p>      The fanner just stared at him-the pig smacking his lips and      leaning toward the next apple.    </p>    <p>      'You know, if you shook the tree, the apples would fall and      the pig could just walk around and eat them off the      ground.' The farmer just stared.    </p>    <p>      The city slicker nervously continued. 'So, at the very      least, it would save time.'    </p>    <p>      The farmer spit and replied, 'Are you nuts or something?      Pigs don't care about time."'    </p>    <p>      Hap raised his eyebrows, waiting for a reaction. I calmly      asked for a second helping of apple sauce to go with my      pork chops.    </p>    <p>      After dinner, I opened a box stacked near the fishing      tackle. The box said disposable syringes. I held one out to      Charlie as if to say, "What gives?"    </p>    <p>      "It was hell getting those things across the border." His      lips started working-story coming. "The border guards      picked me at random to do a thorough search. When they saw      the needles, they went nuts. Somehow, they didn't believe      me when I told them the syringes were for my hobby-fishing.      So the next thing I know, I'm sitting in front of the chief      inspector He's got this big salmon-35 pounds at      leastmounted and hanging on the wall. I knew right then I      was going to get off the hook, so to speak.    </p>    <p>      'Do what? To what? the inspector yelled, when I explained      about injecting the night crawlers with air.    </p>    <p>      I suddenly remembered that Canadians call them dew worms.      ox 'You blow up a dew worm's<br />      behind with air,' I explained.    </p>    <p>      'Which end is the end?' the in- spector asked.    </p>    <p>      Now I was getting worried. Maybe I wasn't going to get off      after all. 'The skinny end,' I said.    </p>    <p>      'Why?' the inspector asked.<br />      <br />      'To make them float-like a long balloon. They float and the      fish see them better.'    </p>    <p>      'And that's why you have a whole carton of syringes? To      make worms float?'    </p>    <p>      'Uh, yeah,' I stammered.    </p>    <p>      'Why so many?' the custom guard baited me. 'Do you have to      practice sterile technique? Throw the needle away after      each use, eh?'    </p>    <p>      I shrugged. If he was needling me, maybe I was winning.    </p>    <p>      'Wouldn't want the worms to die of a needle-transmitted      disease, now would we?' he goaded.    </p>    <p>      I shrugged again.    </p>    <p>      The burly inspector leaned forward on his desk and glared      at me. 'What's the real reason you have a box of 12      syringes?'    </p>    <p>      'Because that's the only way they come. And really, it does      help. Worms really have such low self esteem. This helps      inflate their egos-if only for a brief moment. This is a      chance to rise above their peers. To see and be seen. Their      15 minutes of glory.'    </p>    <p>      'Get out of here!' the border cop bellowed." Hap's mouth      was twitching.    </p>    <p>      It took me a few days to get into Hap's rhythm. By the end      of the ten days, I was mellow and ready to go back to my      full-time job of finding a job.    </p>    <p>      At the train station, Uncle Hap handed me a syringe. "Just      a souvenir," he joked. "In case you're feeling a little      down, a little low. Remember the dew worms."    </p>    <p>      illustration: Smart Art/M.E. Cohen    </p>
