            		<p>		  COUNTRY LORE		</p>				<p>      MOTHER's February/March      issue had a lovely article on building a purple martin      house. Much time, labor, and money were involved for a very      professional-looking finished product.</p><p> Now here's a very      acceptable, much cheaper, and adorable substitute. It      requires three pieces of scrap exterior plywood at least      3/8" thick but not more than 3/4" inch thick, a nice      straight strong twig or dowel about a 1/2" inch in      diameter, a tall white plastic kitchen garbage bag, a      couple of small hinges, bits of leftover exterior paint,      and ten tall juice cans with both ends cut off.</p><p> Be sure the      can edges are smooth and stack them on their sides in a      pyramid (see figure 1). Tape them together. Cut a front and      back for your house to fit over the ends of the cans, plus      a bit more, from your exterior plywood. These should be cut      as triangles with gently rounded corners, or, if you      prefer, cut the front in the shape of a house with a      chimney. Cut a base of plywood an inch or two bigger than      the bottom of your pyramid.    </p>        <p>      Take your front piece of plywood and cut entry holes for      each can. Drill 1/4" holes between each can-front and      back-for ventilation. Nail or screw the front securely onto      the base, back an inch or two from the edge (see figure 2).      Attach the back to the base with the hinges so you can drop      it down to clean it out (see figure 3). Be sure to cut your      front and back an inch or two taller than your pyramid of      cans so you can run your twig or dowel front to back to      serve as both a landing rod for the birds and to hold the      house together at the top. To do this, drill a hole big      enough to poke the twig through at the top of the back.      Glue or screw the twig securely to the top of the front.      Drill a hole through the twig near the back end, so you can      peg it securely. (You can hang the peg on the back of your      birdhouse so it doesn't get lost.)</p><p> Wrap your cans securely      as one unit with the plastic garbage bag and place it on      the base, wedged between the front and back. Mount where      and how you please. Paint to suit your fancy. Cheap, easy,      fun-and the birds seem to like it!</p><p> Now, can someone help      me? I want to know how to make the old-fashioned, homemade      baby chicken waterers with the glass jar. Sure would      appreciate it.</p><p> <em>-Maida</em> <em>Rodgers Farmington,      AR</em>    </p>
