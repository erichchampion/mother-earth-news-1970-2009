            		<p>WOOD STOVE UPDATE</p>		    <p>		<strong>An Interview with Dan Melcon, industry gadfly and fellow    alarmist.</strong>		</p>    		<p>		The American market for wood heat is dwindling, and    this emergency reserve of fuel-so entwined with the spirit of    individualism and independence-is being elbowed to the    sidelines by a glut of oil and natural gas. It seems that the    same collective amnesia that allows us to build gargantuan    sport utility vehicles has made us forget that a wood stove    is one of the last practical defenses against another energy    crisis. After we attended the convention of wood, gas, and    pellet stove manufacturers in St. Louis, I discussed this    situation with Dan Melcon, who has made a career of    monitoring the "hearth products" industry.</p><p>    -Matt Scanlon</p>		<p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>One look at the most current    trade show in St. Louis is enough to convince a prospective    wood stove buyer that the industry is in a real transition.    The place was full of multi-thousand dollar gas and pellet    stoves ... combination fishtanks and radiant beaters. But I    saw virtually no actual wood-burning stoves. My first    question to you is: Why has the wood stove seemingly    disappeared from the wood stove industry?</em></p><p> Dan Melcon:    [Laughs] It's true, but I haven't heard anyone ask me that    question in a long while. I did an article a while back    entitled "Whither the Wood Stove?" so I can appreciate what    you are referring to. I think that the wood stove has largely    disappeared from the wood stove industry because of declining    energy prices for one, the mentality that wood stove heat is    a hassle, the perception that wood heat is an environmental    "bad guy," and finally, simple demographics.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>So as oil prices plummet, wood    beat seems less of a bargain?</em></p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> It    seems that way, but wood heat is still one of your least    expensive forms of home heating. The variable is how you    account for your own labor. Throwing logs into a stove is, to    some degree, labor intensive. So it depends upon how you    value that. But in terms of cost per million BTUs, wood,    along with natural gas, is still one of the best buys. Gone,    however, are the days when your oil bill exceeded your house    payment. Oil is selling for well under a dollar a gallon,    about 50% less than in the heyday of wood stove enthusiasm.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>It's hard for me to swallow that    Americans are gladly disposing of a bargain for the sake of    sheer convenience ... I mean, the practicality of wood beat    is still only an oil-crisis away.</em></p><p> <strong>DM.:</strong>    Wood heat is regarded by a lot of people as work, and work    that they don't have to do now. It might be because their own    economic situation is better or it might be because the cost    of the other energy options is a lot less expensive than it    had been. And also, as a society, we have gotten away from    some of the core values of [ <em>MOTHER'S</em> ] readership:    being selfsufficient and harboring our natural resources and    using them wisely. Whether you look at the incredibly    wasteful sport utility vehicles or at the ostentatious square    footage of new housing, we're not nearly as concerned about    living on a small planet anymore. Part of that care should be    heating with wood.</p><p> <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>To be fair,    the government has played an indispensable role in the demise    of the wood stove. Now you have to be a combustion physicist    to go into business.</em></p>    		<p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> The government was    the trigger point for it. In the 70s and early '80s, when you    were heating with wood, you were one of the good guys. You    were getting local energy and it was renewable. It was taking    petrodollars out of the pockets of the OPEC countries.    Whereas now, the perception is that wood stoves are a duty    form of energy. One of the most frustrating things from my    point of view is that the appliances that are available now    are so much better than the ones that the vast majority of    people experienced. When people ask me what I do, my short    answer is that I'm in the "wood. stove business." A lot of    people's response is, "I thought that wood stoves were    outlawed." Yes, the EPA is regulating them, and other than    automobiles, it's the only consumer product the EPA    regulates. The perception again was that the government had    to step in because the old stoves were a major pollution    problem. There were problems, especially in the West, where I    lived. But the problems were as much of maintenance and    operation as they were problems of poor design. In the past    ten to 15 years, the industry has really made quantum leaps    in stove design and in reducing emissions ... getting    corresponding increases in efficiency. When people talk about    wood stoves, they think of all those Model T's that are in    the field that were built in the 70s and '80s.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Until the EPA began to intervene    in the late '80s.</em></p><p><strong>D.M.:</strong> Right. The EPA    certification process has been in place for ten years now.    July 1, 1988, is when it first officially kicked in and    everything manufactured since then has had to be certified as    clean burning. I'd say about a million stoves were made in    the ten year period since then. But in the late 70s and early    '80s, there were about two and a half million stoves being    sold per year and the government estimates that there are    roughly 15 million existing wood stoves out there. The    analogy I use is that it's as if people were continuing to    use computers from the early 1980s. The improvements are    there, whether it's bum time or reduced clearance to    combustibles, cleaner glass or lower emissions. I think that    if everybody had a certified stove instead of an older unit,    they would use them a lot more because they're a lot more    user-friendly in terms of fire control now.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Do you really attribute the fact    that they're holding onto their old stoves to relative    ignorance, or do the old stoves simply accomplish what people    need them to do? My argument against your computer analogy is    that a new computer is capable of doing five or six times as    much work as an early '80s model, whereas a wood stove    basically accomplishes its mission regardless of design.    Nothing in my review of the new stoves suggests that they are    that different.</em></p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> They're radically    different in how much cleaner burning they are. But from a    consumer's standpoint, they both heat the house. And whether    you use two cords of wood or two and half cords of wood a    year, it's not sufficient incentive to go out and make the    investment to upgrade. All the stoves in this country are    being used far less than they had been anyway, in terms of    the consumption of total cords of wood per year. Consumption    of cordwood has been declining for years. People like stoves,    they leave them in, they want them for backup, certainly. The    ice storms across northern New England and in southern Canada    this year reacquainted people with some of their benefits.    But to a large degree they leave them in the comer and turn    up the thermostat.</p><p> <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>What would a    low-end stove installation run a consumer .. say a low-end    stove capable of beating a 1500 square foot house?</em></p>    <p>D.M.: For an installed package-that is the stove, the    hearth pad the stove sits on, wall protection if it is    needed, chimney installation-you're going to be between    $1,600 and $1,800 for an installed, certified, clean burning,    cordwood burning conventional stove, on die low end. That    could run all the way up to $3,000 for a nicer cast-iron    enamel stove with whistles and bells. The certification costs    are one large part of why such a basically simple appliance    is so expensive. For instance, almost all the stoves on the    market now have dear ceramic Wass to allow viewing of the    fire. And yet this material, because it's shatterproof, is    expensive. When I used to work at Omni Environmental Services    test lab, part of the safety test included heating the glass    to 1400Â°F, then squirting cold water on it and smacking    it with a two-inch steel ball swung on a 16-inch pendulum.    It's very expensive stuff, testing. All these improvements    incorporated as standard features in the stoves have caused    the price to increase as well.</p><p> <strong>MOTHER:</strong>    <em>When we are figuring the low cost of wood .. is that    taking into consideration the up-front installation    costs?</em></p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> You amortize the total    cost-$1,600 to $1,800 on the low end-along with the cost of    the fuel itself. It's assuming you're purchasing cordwood at    about $100 a cord. it does take into account the cost of the    equipment.</p><p> <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>A furnace costs a lot    more than that. But I was shocked to find that the least    expensive wood stove I saw costs about a thousand bucks. I    wondered what the world was coming to.</em></p><p>    <strong>D.M.:</strong> Just going through some of the    companies in my mind, Travis Industries' Lopi "The Patriot"    will heat 1,000 to 1,500 square feet. When you buy it    stripped down, without the fan, without the convection    chamber, without the gold door, it's list price is just under    $750. it's a good value.</p><p> <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>But    that's not representative of the standard low end.</em></p><p>    <strong>D.M.:</strong> Of the stoves that are sold out there,    maybe 20% are under $1,000, maybe 60% are about $1,500, and    maybe 20% are $1,500 and up for the stove itself.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Are there any other    manufacturers at the low end that offer good value?</em></p>    		<p>    <strong>D.M.:</strong> Jotul of Norway is the largest    manufacturer of wood stoves in the world. They make a    cast-iron stove called the 602. This design predates WWII.    They modified one of these models so it passes the EPA    standards. it's a small unit; it's more a zone heater for a    room. It's not a whole house heater, but it retails for about    $600. Waterford Stoves out of Ireland has a nice real low-end    box cast-iron stove [the 104 MKII, see following page for    photo] that also is in the $600 price range. There are some    stoves designed to go to mass merchants and home centers.    There's a company out of Virginia called Englander that makes    some. There is a company that's a subsidiary of Jacuzzi up in    Ontario called Century Heating Products that makes some    low-end stuff ... and there are other good values to be had,    you've just got to scour those dealers. John Gulland    instituted a great Web site for a potential buyer that I    refer to often ( http://www.gulland.ca/ ).</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> Do you think the industry has any    regrets about leaving behind the pioneering spirit of wood    beat? Do they feel that they've inherited an unfortunate    situation from the government that they're making the best    of? Maybe they're just making good money right now and that's    the end of it.</p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> No, a lot of people in    the industry are very uneasy about where we are headed. They    feel like we have in fact left our roots and abandoned the    core philosophy that brought people into the business in the    first place. Many are not comfortable with it at all.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Trade shows are always exercises    in splendor, but that opening presentation of an enormous gas    stove with a waterfall running over it struck me as a perfect    metaphor for what is wrong with the beating business right    now.</em></p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> Right. It's like: "What the    hell is all this about?" To be honest, that's my reaction: Is    this appropriate? Do we need this? Is this what we have been    about historically? The answer in my mind, obviously, is no,    but the reality is that the industry is changing, and it is    changing to reflect consumer choices and consumer demand.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Are there more manufacturers now    than there were five years ago?</em></p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong>    The number of wood and pellet stove manufacturers continues    to decline. During the energy crisis, around 1979, there were    about 2,000 manufacturers that had listed products. By the    time the EPA regulations kicked in about ten years ago, the    number had dropped to about 500. That was natural attrition.    The market declined; people that did not build good units, or    were not good business people, or who could not adapt to    improvements in aesthetics got squished. The next big squeeze    was with the EPA rule. To mitigate it, they had temporary    exemptions for small manufacturers of less than 2,000 stoves.    There are now about 60 manufacturers that make certified wood    stoves, but only 20 really do any volume and make more than    1,000 stoves. I'd say 20 companies make less than 1,000    stoves, 20 make less than 500, and 20 make more than 1,000.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>The majority of the time, it    seems that new stoves are purchased as a decorative adjunct    to an existing beating system. These are not primary systems    anymore.</em></p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> I think it's fair to say    that almost no one is buying a hearth product because they    have to. In the '70s, with those tremendous oil bills ... you    had to do something about it. Now that's not the case.    They're making the choice for aesthetic, ambiance, lifestyle    reasons. One thing that has never been lost is the universal    appeal of the fire. I always say that watching burning fire    and falling water are two things that intrigue and entrance    people. That appeal is always there, but now it's a matter of    choice, not necessity.</p>    		<p><strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>It will    shock MOTHER readers to bear that people are not buying wood    stoves because they need them anymore but because they look    pretty.</em></p><p><strong>D.M.:</strong> A perfect example of your    statement is that currently there are 500,000 sets of vented    gas logs sold every year, which pour 50,000 to 100,000 BTUs    per hour straight up the chimney. It's incredible. I'm in    rural Vermont, where there is no access to natural gas. When    the oil companies say we can sell you a gallon for 70  cents    and 20 years ago it was $1.20, you heat with what works best    and most simply. Nobody's buying because they have to. It's    because they want a fire in their home.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>This explains why an    overwhelming number of pellet stoves-and some of the gas    stoves-actually require electricity to run.</em></p><p>    <strong>D.M.:</strong> Right. All pellet stoves require    electricity. There are backup systems available, but if    you're using a pellet stove, you're on the grid.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>And you're cold without it.</em></p><p>    <strong>D.M.:</strong> You can run them off of 12V batteries.    There are backup units, but again, they are for relatively    short periods of time. Most power outages are for relatively    short periods of time. But that's not always the case...</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Absolutely.. This winter we were    reminded in the north country that a single ice storm can    chase you out of your house and into a Red Cross shelter in a    couple of days in the absence of a backup beating system. Did    the storm change the industry 's attitude about wood beat?    Has it influenced sales?</em></p>    <p>D.M.: Most gas appliances don't need electricity to    operate, so if you had a gas or wood stove, you were probably    in good shape ... but yes ... I think the ice storm was a    wake-up call to the industry to get back to its roots. All of    a sudden our products were something that people needed, that    they depended upon in order to stay in their homes.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Are there any governmental    regulations this year that affect the wood burner?</em></p><p>    <strong>D.M.:</strong> At this point, no. The EPA standards    of ten years ago have proven effective in cleaning up the    emissions from individual stoves. The problem of pollution    from wood has largely gone away because of the wholesale    decline in the use of wood heat anyway. Some of the worst    problems with wood heat were in Oregon. I worked really hard    with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality that came    up with the first standards and which essentially became the    EPA standards. And so the problem essentially went away. At    this point, there are no significant changes on the horizon.    I pay lots of attention to regulations, and there are no red    flags out there.</p>    		<p><strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Where is the industry    beaded? Do you forecast still fewer wood stoves being    produced;, more gas stoves?</em></p><p><strong>D.M.:</strong> Wood    stove sales declined from 1981 until 1996 or 1997; there was    a little spike during the Gulf war, with a crisis mentality    and rising oil prices, but it seems to have leveled out.    Pellet stoves came on strong with lots of appeal. Then people    found out that a lot of the primary benefits that pellet    stoves offer-convenience and efficiency-are there in spades    with gas. A lot of the potential pellet market converted to    gas. Pellet stoves went way up, then declined. Wood and    pellet stove sales seem to have leveled out. There will    always be a market for them. There will always be people like    myself who like burning wood, who like the ritual of making a    fire, who like the unique penetrating warmth that comes from    the radiant heat of a stove relative to heated air. That    market will always be there, and it seems to have stabilized.    My suspicion is that it is going to come down to a slight    degree. Here is where I'll get politically incorrect again.    Watching a real wood fire is mesmerizing: it's changing, it's    alive, it's happening all the time. Watching a pellet fire is    much less appealing. You have a combustion fan that is    blowing into the firepot. As much as the gas industry feels    that a gas fire can mimic a wood fire, it's not the same. I'm    hopeful that wood will rise again.</p><p><strong>MOTHER:</strong>    <em>It does get pretty hysterical watching the industry    chasing its tail and inventing whirring aluminum flakes that    simulate the undulation of flame in a gas stove.</em></p><p>    <strong>D.M.:</strong> The question is, "Why are you guys    working so hard to create a fake fire when a real fire is    available?" I think the answer to that over time will be a    shift back to wood. But there are still issues that need to    be resolved about fuel. Gas is a no-brainer as a fuel: it's    piped to your house. Pellet distribution is not a factor in    general. You go to the store, you buy a ton of them or you    have them delivered, and you pour them in the stove.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>And much of what constitutes    pelletfuel is wastepaper and waste wood that would otherwise    be disposed of.</em></p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> It's a waste    by-product that would otherwise end up in land disposals or    something like that, yes. Whereas with wood you either have    to get it yourself or you have to buy it. The old guy with    his chain saw and pickup truck has largely disappeared from    the scene as the economy has gotten better and the demand for    cordwood has declined.</p><p><strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Well,    we're not planning on selling the pickup and chain saw just    yet.</em></p><p> <strong>D.M.:</strong> [Laughs], Yeah, I'll hitch a    ride during the next energy crisis.</p>
