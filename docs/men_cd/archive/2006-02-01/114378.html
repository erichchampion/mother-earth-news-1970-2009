                    <h3>      Tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements; blower      door tests to fix drafty houses; and preventing window      condensation.    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Ken Sheinkopf    </h5>        <p>      <strong>NEW ENERGY INCENTIVES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Back in the early 1980s, we bought a solar water heater for      our home and took advantage of a great federal tax credit      (I think it was around 40 percent). I heard on the news      that the new energy bill signed by President Bush has tax      credits for solar energy systems. Are these the same      credits we had before?    </p>    <p>      -Joseph W.<br />      Scranton, Pennsylvania    </p>    <p>      Actually, they are much more comprehensive. The Energy      Policy Act of 2005 is the first major federal government      program for energy in the past 13 years, and it gives tax      credits far beyond the solar-only ones that started during      the Carter administration and ended in 1985.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        Get a $2,000 tax credit when you buy a new home that cuts        energy use by at least 50 percent when compared to the        model energy code.      </p>    </div>    <p>      The new bill provides tax credits for highly efficient new      homes, improvements to existing buildings, high-efficiency      air conditioners and home fuel-cell systems, as well as      solar water-heating systems and photovoltaics (solar      electric systems) installed after Jan. 1, 2006.    </p>    <p>      Credit amounts range from 10 percent to 30 percent-or      offer a fixed dollar amount depending on the measures you      take-and you can take advantage of multiple tax      incentives when you buy a home or improve your current one.      Keep in mind that these are credits, not deductions. The      amount of the credit is subtracted directly from the taxes      you owe, unlike deductions, which are subtracted from your      income to determine your tax liability.    </p>    <p>      If you buy a new home that uses at least 50 percent less      energy compared to the requirements in the model energy      code-which contains energy-efficiency criteria for      new residential buildings-you will receive a $2,000      tax credit. Even if you aren’t buying a new home,      many incentives are available that can make your next home      more efficient. Fix up your current home with insulation,      new windows or doors, and you can receive a credit of 10      percent (up to $500). Buy a high-efficiency air      conditioner, water heater or fan and you can get a credit      up to $300. Solar water-heating systems and solar electric      systems are eligible for credits of 30 percent (up to      $2,000 each). Other products and building strategies are      eligible to receive credits, including incentives      specifically for manufactured homes. You can check out this      easy-to-follow summary of the incentives at      aceee.org/press/Tax_incentive05.pdf, or get a summary of      the various programs at fsec.ucf.edu/EPAct-05.htm.

They told us we need a blower      door test. Is this some kind of gimmick or will it actually      help us?    </p>    <p>      -Jason G.<br />      San Diego, California    </p>    <p>      In a world where e-mail messages promise us great riches      and incredible bargains every day, people are extremely      skeptical about sales claims. However, in this case, the      answer is a resounding “do it!”    </p>    <p>      One of the most likely causes of high energy bills is air      leaking into and out of your house. The easiest way to tell      if your home is leaking air is to walk around your home on      a windy day and hold your hand near windows and doors, in      front of electrical outlets and against walls to feel for      any air currents. Odds are good you’ll find places in      your home that need to be sealed better-usually      around openings from the outside for wires and pipes, in      places where different building materials meet, and where      cracks and holes have developed in walls or floors. Sealing      these openings will dramatically reduce the amount of      cooled or heated air that escapes outside and, conversely,      will keep outdoor air where it belongs.    </p>        <p>      Since the 1970s, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning      (HVAC) contractors have used blower door tests to measure      unwanted airflow problems. It’s a fairly simple test:      A special panel system with a variable-speed blower is      fastened securely into one of your home’s doorways,      and the blower creates a pressure difference between the      inside of your home and the outdoors that pushes air      through any openings. The contractor probably will use a      little smoke stick that allows him or her to see where the      air is flowing. The problem spots then can be identified      and sealed to stop the air leakage. HVAC contractors also      can identify leaky places in your home’s ductwork,      which can be another major cause of high energy bills.    </p>    <p>      Your contractor often can perform these tests at a fairly      low cost, and repairing the sources of unwanted airflow is      not expensive. Take the advice of the HVAC contractor and      have the leaks sealed. Be sure to hire someone with      experience in this field and check his or her references.      This isn’t a job for the casual DIYer or for a      company without experience and knowledge of home ductwork      systems.    </p>    <p>      <strong>REDUCING WINDOW CONDENSATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      We live in an older house that hasn’t been remodeled      much over the years, and we get a lot of condensation on      our windows. I know you would recommend replacing them with      newer windows, but can we do anything about this without      spending much money?    </p>    <p>      -Bernice W.<br />      Omaha, Nebraska    </p>    <p>      Basic windows with single or even double panes that have      standard aluminum frames can cause water vapor to condense      on the inside of the windows during winter. That water      often drains to the bottom of window sills where it can rot      the sills and even ruin the wall finish and sheetrock.      Condensation can be a problem in summer, too, when moisture      collects on the outside of windows after the glass surface      falls below the dew point.    </p>    <p>      Certainly these problems can block your exterior view, but      what’s worse is the damage they can cause to your      home. Frankly, it’s hard to eliminate all the      moisture that accumulates on windows, which is especially      prevalent in single-pane windows or in homes with      inadequate ventilation. But controlling this moisture      problem can help reduce the growth of mold, mildew and      damage to the walls.    </p>    <p>      One thing you can do is lower your home’s indoor      humidity. Use vent fans in your kitchen and bathrooms to      remove moisture from the house. Make sure your clothes      dryer is vented to the outdoors and the exhaust is flowing      freely out of the machine and into the vent. In winter,      cover your windows with storm windows or insulation kits      available at hardware stores. If you have a humidifier,      make sure it’s not set to put too much moisture into      the home’s air.    </p>    <p>      Ken Sheinkopf is a communications specialist with the      American Solar Energy Society (www.ases.org).    </p>    <div class="sidebar">            <h3>        LEARN about green homes and remodeling<br />        FINDgreen building professionals<br />        SHOWCASE your home<br />        and share what you’ve learned      </h3>            <p>        Mother invites you to register in our online Green Homes        and Renewable Energy Directory.
