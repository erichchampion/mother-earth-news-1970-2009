                        <p>      <strong>T</strong>he great American road trip is a      time-honored tradition. But these days, high gas prices and      concerns about pollution and global warming have conspired      to make hitting the road a guilty pleasure. Fortunately,      alternative fuels and vehicles are changing that, and the      intrepid Australian traveler Shaun Murphy and his canine      companion, Sparky, prove how in their new TV show, Coolfuel      Roadtrip.    </p>    <p>      “My goal was to show everyone how many different      natural fuels there are in America’s own back yard,      so I went on the road trip to piece them all      together,” Murphy says. “In doing so, I met a      lot of interesting people and drove some outrageous      vehicles.”    </p>    <p>      Crossing 30 states and racking up 16,000 miles, Murphy      sought out innovative-sometimes      quirky-Americans with alternative vehicles, including      an eclectic assortment of electric cars, bikes, scooters      and motorcycles; biodiesel cars and a dragster; a stretch      Hummer limousine powered by biodiesel and a carbohydrate      gasifier system; a BMW roadster powered by corn whiskey;      and a solar-powered canoe.    </p>    <p>      Each of the first 13 episodes shows Murphy in a different      state, with different vehicles. The adventure often takes      unexpected turns as he meets some strange and clever      characters who help him along the way, such as a rapping      biofuel supplier known as the Ayatollah Granola of Canola,      and eco-conscious Hollywood stars such as Ed Begley Jr. and      Darryl Hannah. The last five episodes offer      behind-the-scenes looks into the fuels, vehicles, people      and bloopers of the trip.    </p>    <p>      For much of the journey, Murphy says he didn’t know      how he would find his next ride. “I used the Internet      to search for locals who had alternative-fuel vehicles,      improvising the whole way. I definitely winged it,”      he says.    </p>    <p>      Coolfuel Roadtrip airs nationally this year.

Powered by 10 Trojan 12-volt batteries that produce 78        horsepower; motor controller produces 400 amps with        regenerative breaking.      </p>      <p>        • 1996 BMW Z3 Roadster. Powered by 1.9-liter,        175-horsepower engine modified to run on 100-percent corn        whiskey; a regenerative hydrogen generator system helps        increase mileage by using waste heat.      </p>      <p>        • 1997 32-foot Hummer H1 limousine. Powered by        food-derived biodiesel and a waste-heat-powered biomass        gasifier, which converts carbohydrates into hydrogen,        methane and carbon monoxide; regenerative hydrogen system        increases mileage and reduces emissions.      </p>      <p>        • Tzero prototype electric car. Powered by a        50-kilowatt lithium-ion battery with a range of 300 miles        and standard AC outlet plug-in capability; drivetrain is        a 150-kilowatt Propulsion AC150 induction motor, capable        of zero to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds, 102-mph top speed.      </p>    </div>    <h3>      Cleaner Cars are on the Way    </h3>    <p>      New York state announced last November that it would adopt      California’s strict limits on automobile emissions of      carbon dioxide, a major global warming gas. The      announcement fulfills Gov. George Pataki’s pledge to      make all cars sold in New York adhere to the California      standards. It also puts him on a direct collision course      with the Bush administration, which has joined the major      automobile manufacturers in opposing the California      program.    </p>        <p>      The California standards, approved by its state legislature      in 2002, require manufacturers to begin cutting carbon      dioxide emissions in 2009 model year vehicles, with a goal      of reducing these emissions 30 percent by the 2016 model      year. This is an ambitious target, and absent a sudden      technological breakthrough, the only feasible way to meet      it is for automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars,      which produce less emissions.    </p>    <p>      The program faces a legal siege. The automakers and the      Bush administration argue that this is merely a backdoor      way of mandating tougher fuel economy standards, which      under current law is the responsibility of the federal      government. California’s reply is that it has a      right-indeed, an obligation-under the Clean Air      Act to remove pollutants of any kind from      California’s air.    </p>    <p>      The larger issue here is one of political leadership.      President Bush has refused to regulate greenhouse gas      emissions from any source-cars, power plants or      industrial sites-preferring instead a softer,      voluntary approach that has yielded little progress.      Congress, meanwhile, has refused to mandate significant      increases in fuel efficiency.    </p>    <p>      Impatient governors who take global warming more seriously      than the President and Congress-including Republicans      like Pataki and California Gov. Arnold      Schwarzenegger-have therefore decided to take matters      into their own hands.    </p>    <p>      Altogether, more than 30 states have approved global      warming laws of one sort or another. A consortium of      Northeastern states has announced a breakthrough program      that imposes regional caps on power plants’ emissions      and sets up a trading program to help cut these emissions      in a cost-effective manner.    </p>    <p>      The impact of the automobile program could be huge if it      survives legal challenges. Cars and light trucks (a      category that includes sport utility vehicles) account for      one-fifth of America’s greenhouse gas emissions and      about 40 percent of its oil consumption. In addition to New      York, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode      Island and Vermont have opted to follow the California      standards.    </p>    <p>      This means that by early 2006, nearly one-third of the      automobile retail market is likely to be covered by the new      regulations-a tremendous incentive to the industry to      start making fuel-efficient cars for everyone.    </p>    <p>      This editorial originally appeared in The New York Times on      Nov. 11, 2005. Copyright by The New York Times Co.;      reprinted with permission.    </p>    <h3>      New Jersey Farms Grow Energy    </h3>        <p>      More than 75 farmers in New Jersey have found a way to save      money on their electricity bills while also reducing      pollution - solar power.    </p>    <p>      They are members of Power Crop Initiative, a unique      for-profit program that pays for the installation and      maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) arrays on farms, using      private funds and state rebates. In return for providing      space for the installation, participating farmers get      guaranteed discount prices for electricity.    </p>    <p>      Pam Frank, spokeswoman for Sun Farm Network, the company      that launched the initiative in 2003, says the program is      an effort to make alternative energy more affordable to the      masses.    </p>    <p>      “Solar power is great, but the upfront cost is      huge,” Frank says. “We wanted to find a way to      make it sustainable and competitive in the mainstream      market.”    </p>    <p>      The program made sense to commercial flower grower Tom Roll      of Lebanon, N.J., who says the six PV arrays are a nice fit      among his greenhouses.    </p>    <p>      “I’m always looking for ways to cut down on my      energy bills,” he says.    </p>    <p>      Roll admits that his line of work requires lots of energy      and that he has been “a fuel pig.” His annual      electricity bills used to total $18,000. At Sun      Farms’ reduced rates, Roll says he expects to save      approximately $2,000 a year. “We all have to look at      alternative ways to sustain our way of life,” he      says. “My first bill showed me that the energy I used      that month contributed 2,000 pounds less carbon dioxide      (CO2) to the atmosphere - that’s a positive pat      on the back for me.”    </p>    <p>      Frank says the program has helped prevent the release of      more than 1 million pounds of CO2. “The network keeps      growing, and we like to think that we are in the business      of building the next generation of power plants,” she      says.    </p>    <p>      So far, the program is available only in New Jersey, but      Frank says there is enough interest from neighboring New      York and Pennsylvania that a future regional initiative is      possible.    </p>    <p>      “The reason the Sun Farm Network exists today is the      great policy initiative of New Jersey,” she says.      “It has generous rebates and incentives for      alternative energy, which makes it a very good environment      for this type of program.”    </p>    <p>      For more information, go to www.sun farmnetwork.com.<br />      -Umut Newbury    </p>    <h3>      Big Brother in the Barnyard    </h3>    <p>      The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is developing a      National Animal Identification System (NAIS) for all      livestock. The plan-which may become      mandatory-would require every person who owns even      one livestock animal to register in a federal database and      to tag the animal, possibly with a microchip that can be      read from a distance.    </p>    <p>      The USDA says the program would help identify farm animals      exposed to diseases, so that problems can be contained and      eradicated quickly.    </p>    <p>      Critics say that NAIS is just another program designed to      benefit large-scale producers whose animals have a higher      risk of disease outbreaks. They are also concerned the      identification program will invade farmers’ privacy      and create heavy financial burdens for small-scale      producers.    </p>    <p>      To learn more about the potential problems of this program,      search for the article “The Real Deal: Tagging      Terrorist Chickens” at www.scoop.co.nz.

Green power currently accounts for        about 2 percent of America’s electricity supply,        but investment is accelerating the development of        renewable energy. The number of residential customers who        buy green power has more than doubled over the past five        years, and green energy purchases by large businesses and        other U.S. organizations have also increased        dramatically. The new report also notes that as wind        power has become more competitive with natural gas over        the past five years, the premiums consumers pay for power        from renewable sources have declined at an average annual        rate of 8 percent.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Seattle Adopts Pesticide Policy</strong>      </p>      <p>        Last fall, the Seattle School Board adopted a policy to        protect students from exposure to hazardous pesticides at        area schools. The policy requires parental notification        prior to pesticide use, severly restricts the use of the        most toxic pesticides and calls for the implementation of        integrated pest management at all school sites.

The        5,000-square-foot photovoltaic array will generate about        50,000 watts of energy on sunny days - comparable        to the amount of electricity 10 average-sized homes use        annually. “This project is another step for us on        our journey toward our dream of freeing Stonyfield Farm        from the impacts and risks of fossil fuels,” says        Gary Hirshberg, the company’s CEO.      </p>    </div>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Calculate Your Solar Needs Online      </h3>      <p>        A new Web site promises to make solar power more        accessible.      </p>      <p>        Findsolar.com brings together more than 400 solar        professionals and manufacturers from across the country        and offers a solar calculator to determine the cost of        adding solar energy to a home.      </p>      <p>        Launched last October, the site is a partnership between        the American Solar Energy Society, Solar Electric Power        Association (SEPA), Energy Matters and the U.S.        Department of Energy.      </p>      <p>        Julia Judd, executive director of SEPA, says they began        working on the site a year and a half ago.      </p>      <p>        “We were always getting calls about the cost of        solar power and how to find someone locally,” she        says. “We really saw a need to have one single tool        that answered those primary questions for        consumers.”      </p>      <p>        The calculator gives a cost estimate based on location,        climate and electric bills. Currently, the Web site        calculates costs for solar electricity and solar water        heating for pools, spas and domestic hot water. More        options will be available as the site grows. By 2008, the        site will have about 10 sections including solar thermal        heating and cooling, daylighting and ground-source heat        pumps.      </p>      <p>        Brad Collins, executive director of the American Solar        Energy Society, says solar energy has become more        practical. Warranties and certifications have made solar        installations more reliable, and advances in technology        have made it more cost-efficient.      </p>      <p>        “It’s cheaper in the long run,” he        says. “Who knows what the price of heating oil will        be in 15 years, but we know the price of sunshine.”      </p>      <p>        Collins hopes the site will make the use of solar power        more common. “Half of the buildings that will exist        in 2030 haven’t been built yet,” he says.        “That means we have a chance to affect all of        them.”      </p>      <p>        -Megan Moser      </p>    </div>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Nature Empowers Children      </h3>      <p>        All parents hope that their children will grow up to be        happy adults who are able to find creative solutions to        the challenges of life. Yet children don’t come        with an instruction manual, and most now live in a world        far different from the one of their parents’        childhoods. Schedules are tight, and after-school hours        once spent climbing trees or sloshing along stream banks        are now clicked away in front of a computer. Nature is        taught in schools and appears regularly on TV, but        children rarely experience it firsthand.      </p>      <p>        Therein lies the problem that author Richard Louv        eloquently explores in Last Child in the Woods: Saving        Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder. Piece by        piece, Louv presents evidence of what a life without        nature means to children, their families and the social        agendas that lie ahead. He cites study after study that        validates involvement with nature - including good        old free-form outdoor play - can increase        children’s attention spans, improve their ability        to concentrate and even foster relaxation in children        diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.      </p>      <p>        Time spent playing in mud puddles or collecting        fort-building branches also may constitute one of the        best foundations for the emergence of creativity. When        compared to styling a secret sanctuary for tadpoles, not        much original thought is needed for children to play with        most modern toys. Rambling through meadows or daydreaming        in the sun, children often experience transcendent,        self-defining moments that stay with them for life. The        connectedness that comes with these experiences opens        young minds to a world far more vast and mysterious than        the more familiar one that relies on gizmos that plug        into wall sockets.      </p>      <p>        In Louv’s view, children need more free time        outdoors, and parents should sort through real and        not-so-real fears regarding their children’s        safety. Yet the responsibility for correcting        nature-deficit disorder extends beyond the family to        educators, city planners, community leaders and        green-thinking landscape designers.      </p>      <p>        Neighborhoods can include safe, diversified green spaces;        trees and butterfly gardens can be incorporated into        playgrounds; and cities can make room for pockets of        wildlife habitat. Louv thinks the possibilities are        especially exciting for small rural towns, which can        quickly become ideal habitats for adults and children.      </p>      <p>        Louv clearly defines the problem and introduces a number        of solutions, many of which are quite simple. For        example: When shopping for a house, the availability of        nearby hiking and biking trails might be worth much more        than a good real estate deal or a top-rated school        system. The best use of a free weekend might be an        inexpensive camping trip. Turn off the TV. Unplug the        computer. Make a garden. Go fishing. Lay on the ground        and study the night sky.      </p>      <p>        The father of two boys, Louv knows these suggestions        might not always be popular ideas. Go for them anyway. If        children did come with an instruction manual, these are        the kinds of things you would find on page one.      </p>      <p>        -Barbara Pleasant      </p>    </div>
