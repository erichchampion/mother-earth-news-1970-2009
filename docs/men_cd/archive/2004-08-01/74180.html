                    <h5 id="byline">      by Claire Anderson    </h5>    <p>      <em>These 20 nifty products let you go off-road and      off-grid in your tent, camper or RV.</em>    </p>        <p>      Want to escape crowded campgrounds with those growling RV      generators and get off the beaten path? We’ve got      your plan all mapped out. The self-sufficiency travel      advice and products on the following pages will allow you      to make your tent, camper or RV more comfortable, safe and      energy efficient while you travel.    </p>    <p>      My husband, Shawn Schreiner, and I are full-time back roads      and backwoods wanderers: We live and work on the go in our      20-foot-long RV, traveling from place to place as our whims      and work dictate, so being as independent as possible is      always part of our strategy. Today’s compact      renewable energy technologies and hand-powered gadgets      liberate travelers like us from the electrical umbilical      cord without sacrificing all of our creature comforts.    </p>    <p>      We’ve selected 20 travel tools and products that are      solar- or human-powered, low maintenance, portable and      durable (see Page 56 for each supplier’s contact      information). And on Page 58, we describe how we use waste      (free!) vegetable oil to power our diesel truck.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Solar Power</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the benefits of having a home on the road is      boondocking, which is free camping away from commercial      campgrounds and energy hookups. Being completely energy      independent with a photovoltaic (PV) system gives you the      freedom to park your camper or RV almost anywhere, with the      landowner’s permission.    </p>    <p>      A small PV system easily can supply enough power to run a      few lights, a water pump and a few other small electric      gizmos. PV systems are quiet, lightweight and require      almost no attention - just keep the solar panels      clean, and they’ll keep on producing power. Panels      can be mounted flat on the RV’s roof or set into a      tilting mount, which improves the power output by as much      as 10 percent to 20 percent.    </p>    <p>      The average RV user with some basic 12-volt appliances      consumes about 40 to 50 amp-hours of power per day. PV      panels, which cost between $300 and $500, can produce about      20 to 35 amp-hours per day for you, depending on how many      hours of sunlight the panels receive. They can be wired      directly to charge a battery and power your 12-volt lights      and pump, or you can add an inverter, which transforms DC      energy to AC electricity, to power your small standard      appliances.    </p>    <p>      For more than two decades, RV Solar Electric, Inc. [(800)      999-8520; www.rvsolarelectric.com ] has customized PV      systems for recreational vehicles. Their years of      experience led to the publication of the RVer's Guide to      Solar Battery Charging, a popular manual that addresses      hard-to-answer questions about RV solar systems. (See      “RV Solar Sources,” Page 55, for more      providers.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Portable Power (See “Product Sources,”      Page 56, for contact information.)</strong>    </p>    																						    <p>      Put things that go bump in the night in the spotlight with      the rugged, watertight <strong>Solaris Solar      Lantern</strong> . Equivalent to a 40-watt light bulb,      it’s bright enough to cook and read by. A      full-spectrum compact-fluorescent bulb helps this lamp keep      its cool, making it safe for use inside tents and campers.      Charging the battery with the small, flexible solar panel      (included) gives the lamp up to six hours of run time.      About $150, from Real Goods.    </p>    <p>      LEDs (light-emitting diodes that don’t burn out) in      the <strong>Everlite Solar Spotlight</strong> provide an      intense, cool light source, perfect for reading or      emergency lighting. The lamp needs only three hours of      sunlight to power it for 12 hours. Use the solar panel to      charge a cell phone, PDA (personal digital assistant) and      other hand-held devices (adapters available). A nifty zip      travel case keeps everything organized. About $100 to $120,      at Real Goods.    </p>    <p>      Just because you’re traveling doesn’t mean you      have to tune out. And with <strong>Coleman’s Freeplay      Radio</strong> , you’ll have music and news whenever      and wherever you go. A small solar panel mounted onto the      top of this compact AM/FM radio charges the battery inside.      Or if you’re low on sunshine, give the handcrank a      spin to re-energize the radio (30 seconds of crank-time      yields about 30 minutes of play-time). About $40, from      Coleman.    </p>    <p>      You’ll welcome the security of the <strong>SideWinder      cell-phone charger</strong> .. This pocket-sized generator      gives you unlimited talk time when your batteries need a      recharge. Two minutes of winding regenerates your cell      phone to give you six minutes of talk time and about 30      minutes of standby. About $25, from Real Goods.    </p>    <p>      Throw these rugged, weatherproof flashlights in your pack      or glove box - and never be left in the dark. We love      the <strong>SolarVerter</strong> , a solar-powered      flashlight that has red emergency flashers mounted at one      end. It comes with mounting hardware for bicycles. A      water-resistant body also makes it a perfect companion for      kayaks and canoes. About $25, from Lehman’s.      Coleman’s sturdy Freeplay Flashlight (above right)      gives you the option of low or high beams, and a handcrank      means you can have light whenever and wherever you need it.      One minute of winding gives up to 12 minutes of      “shine time.” About $35.    </p>    <p>      You can try cooking on your engine block, but using the sun      is much more fun - not to mention economical and      fuel-efficient. Unfold the <strong>Global Sun      Oven’s</strong> reflectors and angle the glass front      toward the sun to quickly heat this solar wonder. A      temperature gauge mounted in the corner helps you keep an      eye on the level. Our pasta e fagioli boiled and bubbled      within 45 minutes at temperatures between 250 and 300      degrees. You’ll need to reserve room in your vehicle      or RV to store this 2-cubic-foot, 21 pound oven, but      it’s worth it. About $250, from Real Goods.    </p>    <p>      For folks who’d rather crank it up than plug it in,      the <strong>Vortex Handcrank Blender</strong> saves the      day. A two-speed gearing system lets you chop, froth and      blend with ease. We tested the tough, stainless steel blade      on ice, and it cut with razorlike efficiency. The base      cleverly nests in the blender for quick storage. A C-clamp      (included) helps keep everything from quaking when      you’re cranking away. About $70, from GSI Outdoors.    </p>    <p>      Mess kits just got a whole lot neater with these      <strong>stainless steel cooking sets</strong> from Coleman      and GSI Outdoors. Both come with a nifty mesh sack. We      loved the sturdy, quick-grip handles on GSI’s kit,      and the lids, which do dual duty as fry pans.      <strong>Coleman’s kit</strong> gets our kudos for      containment: Three (a cup, bowl and fry pan) nest in one.      The kit also contains a wind screen to shield the flame on      your portable camp stove. Coleman Solo Cook Kit (below      left), about $30. <strong>GSI Outdoors stainless steel mess      kit</strong> (right), about $20. Coleman’s      <strong>eXponent Xpert camp stove</strong> (under the GSI      fry pan) puts an end to cold cans of trail beans. Brew and      bubble your favorite dish over the hardy flame that will      burn at up to 12,000 Btu (British thermal unit, a precise      measure of heat energy). After you’ve downed your      grub, pack this wee stove in your pocket. Available for      about $75. (Use with Peak1 Powermax recyclable cartridges,      with a 60 percent butane/40 percent propane fuel mix.)    </p>    <p>      This compact-yet-heavy-duty <strong>handcrank German coffee      mill</strong> (below left) gives you fresh grounds for four      cups of java in less than two minutes flat. About $55, from      Lehman’s. Use those grounds to prepare the tastiest      brew in this perfectly packable, absolutely indestructible      <strong>Glacier Stainless Steel JavaPress</strong> (right).      And for those who like to slowly savor their morning coffee      or tea, the locking lid and double-walled thermal design      keep drinks piping hot. About $35, from GSI Outdoors. (For      truly great travel coffee, we recommend Mother’s      Blend, an organic, Fair Trade, shade-grown coffee. See Page      57 for ordering information.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Water Works</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sunbathing gains a whole new meaning when you take your      ablutions with a solar shower. Fill the dark-colored bag      with water, set it in the sun for a few hours and then wash      under a spray of deliciously warm water.      <strong>Stearns’ 5.5 gallon Air Power      SunShower</strong> comes with a foot pump to give your      shower an extra pressure oomph for about $40. Real Goods      sells a <strong>4-gallon Super Solar Shower</strong> model      (without the pressure pump), for $15. Water heats from 60      degrees to 108 degrees in about 3 hours.    </p>    <p>      Restore your dingy dungarees and tainted t-shirts to their      former glory with the <strong>Wonder Clean Pressure      Handwasher</strong> , a mini laundromat on legs. Add a few      quarts of warm water and a couple tablespoons of detergent      to the polymer tub, seal the lid securely and spin for a      couple of minutes. Pressure, created by the warm water,      builds within the tub and helps push spots and soil right      out. About $45, from Lehman’s.    </p>    <p>      Without a doubt, the most odious - not to mention      odoriferous! - of camping activities is emptying the      blackwater tank in your RV. Replacing your chemical flush      toilet with a compact composting toilet will put an end to      this hated task, and save water. The <strong>Luggable Loo      portable potty</strong> is another option for dealing with      “waste” (about $13, at most outdoor outfitters      stores). On the road, use it with disposable <strong>waste      bags</strong> , filled with an odor- and liquid-absorbing      gel (about $30 for 12, from Lehman’s). When      you’re parked, turn your loo into a compost      collector. Just cover your deposits with peat moss, and      when the bucket’s full, incorporate the contents into      a compost bin or bury them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sun-Mar’s Ecolet</strong> toilets are      specifically designed for marine and RV use; choose from      the nonelectric system or the 12-volt evaporative heater      and fan to dissipate excess liquid and any odors. About      $900, from Sun-Mar.    </p>    <p>      Put an end to Montezuma’s Revenge, and quench your      thirst safely with a <strong>Katadyn ceramic water      filter</strong> . It removes bacteria, Giardia and      Cryptosporidium. The 8-ounce Mini slips into a coat pocket      or waist pack for easy transport and provides up to a half      quart of clean drinking water per minute of pumping. About      $90, at most outdoor outfitters stores.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RV Solar Sources</strong>    </p>    <p>      These companies offer “RV kits” usually      consisting of a photovoltaic (PV) panel or two and a charge      controller, which prevents your RV batteries from      overcharging. As with any PV system, call the supplier to      discuss your particular power needs.    </p>    <p>      Alternative Energy Store<br />      (877) 878-4060 s<br />      Worcester, Mass.<br />      www.altenergystore.com    </p>    <p>      Backwoods Solar Electric Systems<br />      (208) 263-4290<br />      Sandpoint, Idaho<br />      www.backwoodssolar.com    </p>    <p>      Real Goods<br />      (800) 762-7325<br />      Ukiah, Calif.<br />      www.realgoods.com    </p>    <p>      LowestCostSolar<br />      www.lowestcostsolar.com    </p>    <p>      Northern Arizona Wind & Sun<br />      (800) 383-0195<br />      Flagstaff, Ariz.<br />      www.windsun.com    </p>    <p>      RV Solar Electric, Inc.<br />      (800) 999-8520<br />      Scottsdale, Ariz.<br />      www.rvsolarelectric.com    </p>    <p>      Sierra Solar Systems<br />      (888) 667-6527<br />      Grass Valley, Calif.<br />      www.sierrasolar.com    </p>    <p>      Sunelco Solar<br />      (800) 338-6844<br />      Hamilton, Mont.<br />      www.sunelco.com    </p>    <p>      <strong>Product Sources</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Real Goods</strong> (800) 762-7325      www.realgoods.com    </p>    <p>      <strong>Coleman</strong> (800) 835-3278 www.coleman.com    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lehman’s</strong> (877) 438-5346      www.lehmans.com    </p>    <p>      <strong>GSI Outdoors</strong> www.gsioutdoors.com (Check      their Web site for distributors.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stearns</strong> (800) 333-1179 www.stearnsinc.com    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sun-Mar</strong> (800) 461-2461 www.sun-mar.com    </p>
