                    <h5 id="byline">      by Kris Wetherbee    </h5>        <p>      The secret to enjoying garden-fresh produce at its prime is      knowing when to harvest. If you’ve ever eaten a melon      that lacked sweetness, or green beans that were fibrous and      tough, you know how crucial timing can be. Just as      different vegetables have their own distinct needs for      planting, fertilizing and growing, each also will give      certain clues when it is ready to pick.    </p>    <p>      A few vegetables are very accommodating and can stay in the      ground for weeks until you’re ready to eat them.      Others need continual picking to ensure ongoing production      of a crop, but most have a short window of time during      which they can be gathered at peak flavor. After a      vegetable passes its prime, it undergoes permanent changes      that alter its taste, appearance, quality and, sometimes,      its future production. Sugars turn to starches, and the      texture becomes mushy, like an overripe melon or chewy      green beans.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if you pick too soon, you will harvest a      vegetable that has not had adequate time to develop peak      flavor, substance and nutrition.    </p>    <p>      Here’s a guide to help you know precisely when your      summer and fall fruits and vegetables have reached their      peak of perfection and are ready to be picked and eaten:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Beans</strong> should be checked daily for      harvesting. Snap beans/green beans are ready when the pods      have filled out but the seeds are still tiny, which,      depending on weather conditions, is usually some two to      four weeks after bloom. The pods should be firm and crisp,      with pliable tips. Pick haricot (French filet) types when      the pods are about one-eighth inch in diameter, while      they’re still young and very slender.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Beets</strong> can be picked when the roots are      from 1 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter, and most taste best      when they are about the size of a pingpong ball or golf      ball. White and golden varieties are tasty and tender until      they reach baseball size, but storage (winter-keeping)      varieties remain tender until they reach softball size or      even slightly larger. When harvested past their prime,      beets have a strong taste and tough, pithy texture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Broccoli</strong> should be harvested when the buds      are still tight and before the florets begin opening their      yellow flowers. For the first harvest, cut the central      stalk at a slant about 5 to 6 inches below the base of the      head. This prevents rot and encourages production of new      side shoots, which can be harvested at a later date.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Brussels</strong> sprouts develop a sweet flavor      after the plant has gone through a couple of mild frosts.      The buds at the base are the first to mature, so pick from      the bottom up when sprouts become firm and are about 1 inch      in diameter. To encourage larger sprouts, which mature more      uniformly, cut the top of the plant back by about 4 inches      about four weeks before the harvest is to begin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cabbage</strong> offers some leeway as to when it      can be picked at perfection, though larger heads are more      likely to split than smaller ones. If a head is threatening      to split, twisting it a quarter turn will slow down the      splitting. Cabbage heads that have split are still tasty      and should be picked; they just won’t store as well      as solid heads. Begin harvesting cabbage anytime after      developing heads become solid and firm.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Carrots</strong> usually hold well in the ground      and can be harvested over a long period of time. Begin as      soon as the roots color up and grow to from a half to 1      inch in diameter. Continue harvesting until the last      frost-sweetened carrots are dug before the ground freezes      for winter. Careful digging, rather than pulling, is best      as a harvest method; only pull the roots if your soil is      extremely friable. The texture of a fresh carrot is at its      finest in the young ones, but the sugar content heightens      as they mature.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Cauliflower</strong> is at its best when 6- to      8-inch, fully formed heads are firm and the curds in them      are solid. If you wait until after the curds open (they      resemble rice grains), you have passed the window of      opportunity for harvesting optimum-quality heads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Corn</strong> should be picked when the kernels      have swollen to their maximum juiciness, usually about 20      days after the first silk strands appear. When the silks      begin to turn dry and brown, partially peel back the husks      and pierce a kernel with your thumbnail. If a milky juice      squirts out, the corn is ready to eat. To harvest, snap off      the ear by pulling it downward, then twisting and pulling      again. If allowed to overripen, corn will loose its sweet      flavor and become starchy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cucumbers</strong> grow fast, so check them daily      if you plan to keep up with the peak of harvest and ensure      continued production. For fresh use, a cucumber should be      filled out enough to be crisp and juicy, and measure from 6      to 9 inches long. For sweet pickles, cucumbers are best      harvested when they measure from 1 1/2-to-2 1/2-inches      long; for dill pickles, the ideal length is from 3 inches      to 4 inches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Eggplant</strong> has received a bad rap as a      bitter-tasting vegetable because of the oversized fruits      often sold in supermarkets. Eggplant past its prime is      soft, pithy and laden with seeds, which are what give it      the bitter taste. Fruit harvested while still young and      firm actually is rather sweet and very tender; that’s      when the vegetable measures from 4 inches to 8 inches in      length, or about one-third of its mature size. Use strong      scissors or pruning shears to harvest the fruit, rather      than pulling, which will injure the plant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kale leaves</strong> - a fall green -      usually can be harvested about 40 days after planting,      however, a frost really sweetens and enhances the flavor,      so wait until then if you can. Harvest by taking off outer      leaves as needed; because the plants are frost-hardy, in      mild winter areas, you can pick fresh kale at its prime      well into December.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Leeks</strong> can be pulled from the ground      anytime the stem is an inch in diameter or larger. Use them      when they still are very small for the mildest, most      delicate flavor. Cut off the roots and most of the top      green portion before storing in the refrigerator. (Save the      green part to use in soup stock.) Many varieties will      overwinter in mild climates and remain harvestable into      March. After that, they can develop a hard core in the      center that will not soften even when cooked.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lettuce</strong> can be picked in stages: tiny      leaves for a gourmet salad mix or larger leaves for a main      dish. For loose-leaf varieties, pick outer leaves as      needed, or cut the head an inch above ground for a      cut-and-come-again crop.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Butterheads,</strong> romaines and crispheads      should be harvested when the head begins to form, and for      peak perfection, before the center begins to elongate,      which means that the plant is preparing to flower. After      that point, the lettuce will taste bitter. For refrigerator      storage, run washed leaves through a salad spinner, place      in a sealable plastic bag with a paper towel or tea towel,      and store in the crisper section of your refrigerator.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Melons</strong> can be a challenge, but several      telltale signs can help you decide when the fruit is      perfectly ripe. On some cantaloupes, which also may be      called muskmelons, “netting”      (“venation”) that overlays the skin becomes      more pronounced and the melon will separate easily from the      vine when it’s fully ripened.    </p>    <p>      True cantaloupes and honeydew-types soften and give      slightly to pressure on the blossom end, and the background      color will change; cut these from the vine as they will not      slip from the stem. Pick for optimum quality after the      tendril closest to the fruit turns completely brown. On      watermelons, the surface of the fruit loses its gloss, the      belly side touching the ground changes from white to creamy      yellow and the tendril turns brown and begins to shrivel.      Thumping as a measure of ripeness is a matter of luck; it      works for some and not for others. Those who claim the gift      say the thump should sound hollow and deep.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Okra</strong> should never be allowed to get too      big. Harvest short-pod varieties when they are from 2 to 3      inches in length, usually about four to six days after      flowering. Long-pod types such as ‘Cow Horn’      are best picked at 6 to 8 inches in length. Tips of tender      pods will snap, but those on older pods won’t because      pods mature from the tip down, which means the tip turns      fibrous first. Check pods daily because they can go from      prime to pitiful in 24 hours’ time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Onions</strong> can be harvested in two stages: The      green “scallion” stage or the bulb stage. Green      onions are best when tops are 6 to 8 inches tall and stems      are the thickness of a pencil. For maximum size and mature      bulbs, wait until more than half the tops have fallen down,      then push over the remaining tops. A week later, harvest      the bulbs and set them in the sun for a day or two (cover      at night). Cure the bulbs with tops intact for about a week      in a sheltered, dry area; during this time, the outer      layers form a dry skin. After that, cut the tops about an      inch above the bulbs, trim off the roots and store the      onions in a well-ventilated, dry, cool and dark location.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Peas</strong> are best harvested in the early      morning or early evening, but the stage at which to harvest      the pods depends on the type. Both snap peas and snow peas      are eaten pod and all. For best flavor, pick snap peas when      plump and well colored but not as fully filled as garden      peas. Pick snow peas before the pods fill out, when they      are young, tender and thin. In contrast, garden peas, often      referred to as shell peas, are ready to harvest and shell      when the pods are bright green and fully filled. Then, the      peas inside are sweet, plump and tender - a true      taste treat of the early summer garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Peppers</strong> can be harvested anytime in the      immature green stage - the more you pick, the more      your plant will produce. However, for a fully flavored and      sweet pepper, wait until it changes color. (Some varieties      turn red, others gold, some yellow and still others      orange.) Hot peppers also usually take on more flavor when      their color changes as they mature.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POTATOE's</strong> give an easy signal as to when      they’re ready to harvest: their tops die down. About      two weeks after that happens, dig the potatoes; the delay      gives them time to toughen their skins for long-term      storage. You can leave potatoes in the ground longer; just      be sure to dig them before frost or rain sets in. Carefully      dig tubers with a spading fork, allow them to dry for a few      hours in the sun, then cure them for about two weeks at 50      to 60 degrees under shelter, in a well-ventilated,      high-humidity area. After they are cured, potatoes store      best at 40 to 50 degrees.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Southern peas</strong> , such as black-eyed peas      and crowder peas, are not peas at all but rather a type of      bean that grows in warm locations. Pods are ready to      harvest when well filled with fully developed seeds.      Harvest purple pods when the hulls turn mostly red, and      green pods when the hulls turn a light yellow-green but not      too yellow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Summer squash</strong> is at its best if harvested      on the small side, while skins are still tender. For      zucchini, straightneck and crookneck types, harvest when      fruits are 4 to 8 inches in length; for patty pan      varieties, up to 3 inches in diameter. Don’t let your      squash get too big or the plant’s production will      falter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tomatoes</strong> are tops if picked between the      semi-firm and semi-soft stages, when the fruits are fully      colored (whether gold, pink, orange, red, black or white).      Second best is to pick fruits a few days early and allow      them to finish ripening indoors, an added benefit when      temperatures are too hot or frost threatens. Tomatoes are      best stored at temperatures higher than 50 degrees -      never in the refrigerator, which turns their texture to      mush.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Winter squash</strong> that passes the thumbnail      test (the skin should resist puncture from your thumbnail)      usually is fully ripe and ready to harvest. The stem      hardens and the skin color deepens: Spaghetti squash turns      a mellow golden yellow, butternut deepens to a subtle      orange-tan and a splotch of orange-yellow often will appear      on the underside of acorn, delicata and buttercup types.      Most winter squash will keep up to four months after      harvest if you follow these tips: Harvest after the first      light frost to enhance sweetness but before a hard frost;      never handle squash by the stem (fruits can rot in just a      few weeks after the stem breaks); cut - don’t      pull - squash from the vine, and leave 2 inches of      the stem attached; wipe off any dirt but don’t get      the fruits wet; cure fruits in a warm place (80 to 85      degrees is ideal) for a couple of weeks. Once cured, store      in a cool, dry location at 50 to 55 degrees.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Worth the Wait...</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>When harvest time finally arrives, the fun really      begins!</em>    </p>    <p>      Scrutinize the fruits of your labor daily. Keep handy a      sharp knife, pruning shears, and a bucket or a basket. At      the very moment your (now) discerning eye sees      “ripe,” whisk those prime morsels out of your      garden and into your kitchen, and devour them with gusto.    </p>    <p>      Or, preserve them for future gusto. Handle every piece like      the delicate jewel it is, and avoid bruises and nicks that      would invite decay and jeopardize your enjoyment of the      essence of perfection.    </p>
