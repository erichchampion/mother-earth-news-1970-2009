    <p>
                        <p>      Tachinid flies (Tachinidae) are a prime example of the many      beneficial, but mostly unseen, creatures that make it      possible for us to enjoy naturally healthy gardens without      the use of pesticides. They are small and inconspicuous,      but they are doing a mighty big job for us.    </p>    <p>      Tachinids parasitize other insects. They employ a variety      of tactics as “the party guest from hell” when      they move in, uninvited, and proceed to eat their hosts.      They may glue their eggs to their host or lay their eggs on      foliage where the host larvae will eat them. Some have      ovipositors with which they inject their eggs directly into      the unsuspecting host’s body.    </p>    <p>      Extremely beneficial because of their diversity, tachinids      also can be very under-appreciated due to their small size      and unseen activities. They help control garden pests such      as gypsy moths, cabbage loopers, Japanese beetles,      armyworms, cutworms, sawflies, codling moths, peach twig      borers, pink bollworms, tent caterpillars, squash bugs and      many more.    </p>    <p>      The scientific information is rather general concerning      tachinids. Only a few of the 1,300 North American species      have common names, and only about 20 percent can be      identified with a hand lens and field guide.    </p>    <p>      Tachinid flies are similar in shape and size to houseflies      (usually less than a half inch in length) but they usually      project a few stiff hairs backwards, over and slightly      beyond the abdomen. Most of them are considered rather drab      in color.    </p>    <p>      The tachinid species that seek out moth and butterfly hosts      usually glue their eggs to the moth or butterfly larvae;      after the eggs hatch, the resulting fly larvae bore into      their host, eventually killing it. When beetles are the      host, either larva or adults can be parasitized, depending      on what kind of tachinid is involved. Tachinids usually      attack adults of the true bug and grasshopper orders.    </p>    <p>      Egg and larvae development happen quickly in tachinid      flies. Many species pass from the early stages to adulthood      in just three to four weeks. If the host also moves through      life stages quickly, several generations can be produced in      one garden season.    </p>    <p>      After a larva has invaded or formed inside the host, it      maintains respiration by either attaching its breathing      (posterior) end to its victim’s tracheal system or      leaving that end protruding from the victim’s body.    </p>    <p>      Research is ongoing on several species of tachinids; to      date, the cutworm type has been shown to reduce populations      of the variegated cutworm, the army worm and the      yellow-striped army worm.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, tachinids are not available as commercial      pest controls, but the adult flies feed on nectar, so you      can attract them to your garden by growing plants with      umbel-type flowers, including carrots, cilantro, dill,      coriander, buckwheat and sweet clover. - John Stuart    </p>    <p>      (For more about beneficial insects, see “ Protect      Your Garden with Beneficial Bugs ,” Page 74.)    </p>
