The problem was, I couldn’t afford to buy a tractor or hire the work out. After a month of grading and digging ditches with a shovel and wheelbarrow, my aching back went on strike, demanding that my brain come up with a better idea. I actually enjoyed the aerobic exercise of digging and moving the soil. What consumed all my time and hurt my body was wrenching the compacted soil out of the ground in the first place. Then it occurred to me that there is a machine for “uncompacting” soil - a garden tiller. I bought a new tiller for $600 - what a godsend! The tiller churned through the soil like it was cheese, leaving beautiful loose dirt, free of clods, which was quick and easy to shovel into the wheelbarrow. When I dug ditches for the sprinkler line, I’d till a strip wide enough that the tiller wouldn’t bind on the walls of the ditch as I descended into the ground. Worked like a charm!</p><p><em>Nathan Esplanade<br />Corning, California</em></p><p><strong>Relaxed Fit? This Tipi Wears Jeans</strong></p><p>Thanks to an article on the Plains Indian tipi in the first issue of <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, I launched a 10-year recycling project. The project began in 1993 when I was cleaning up debris on our vacant acre. I decided to turn the debris into a wickiup, a stick-frame shelter that looks like an upside-down bowl. My three children and the birds loved it. I left it standing for a couple of years but envisioned a true tipi as the children got older. For the second stage, I gathered some aspen logs and started a 10-foot-high tipi structure. A canvas covering was far out of reach of my budget, so I pinned old sheets and blankets together. That first weekend we went camping with a few friends in our backyard blanket shelter and stayed very cozy even though the temperature dropped to 32 degrees and a snowstorm hit. What a heavenly experience to be able to reach over and start the fire without first getting out of the sleeping bag. As the early spring day warmed up, we were cooking breakfast in the tipi, wrapped in the warmth of our sleeping bags, the small fire and the joy of the whole experience. Wishing for more than just a blanket-pinned tipi, I started thinking of sewing together materials to make a better cover. Recycled jeans were a perfect choice to simulate a canvas-covering. Many of the jeans had seen several owners before they became a part of the tipi. Each spring I would cover the tipi with what I had sewn together and pin blankets to the bare areas. By 1999, I nearly had the tipi covered when I decided to change the framework to be taller. With the help of a friend, we replaced the poles, and the structure took on its final 15-foot height with the original 15-foot diameter. But the jeans covering didn’t fit properly; I was back to being half-done. I started pricing canvas again, but I have always been committed to showing my children the value of recycling. Then a friend handed me an article from <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> about the Plains Indian tipi. With the guidance of the article, I could envision the completed project. Dedicating myself to taking apart the old design, I refashioned the covering using the article as a reference. After about a year and a half of cutting, sewing and measuring in my spare time, I was ready to see if it fit the framework. It was breathtaking! Now my family and friends stare at the tipi in awe, knowing its humble beginnings and the struggles and dedication it took to see my vision become reality.</p><p><em>Theresa Leonhardt<br />Bailey, Colorado</em></p><p><em>We have reprinted the tipi plan from issue No. 1, in a larger, easier-to-use format.

Two words: free firewood. Today, the elm seeds that I scattered 15 to 20 years ago are feeding our stove with perfect logs of pre-dried wood. American elms once grew into large graceful shade trees, but most of those giants have died from Dutch elm disease, a fungus spread by small bark beetles. The elms are not becoming extinct, however, and you can start your own from seed. The disease only seems to affect trees more than 6 or 8 inches in diameter. This is also about the stage when elms reach sexual maturity, and so they are usually capable of casting some seeds to the wind before the fungus kills them. Flowers appear on elm trees in the early spring just prior to the leaves emerging. Watch for the flat, round waferlike seeds to fall a month or so later. Sometimes a few large elms will have managed to avoid the disease, and these are the best sources of seed. In a good summer you can rake up a sack full of seeds and then simply scatter them along a fence row, trail or other suitable area. American elms will grow on most soils throughout the eastern half of the United States. Trees grown close together will produce tall, straight poles with few side branches. Wilting and browning leaves are a sign of the disease beginning. Eventually the bark will begin to fall from the trunks, and when the trunks are bare, you have perfectly dry standing deadwood. At this stage you can simply fell the trees, saw them up, and stack the logs directly on your “this winter” woodpile. My wife, Carol, and I have burned elm logs in our woodstove the same day we cut them. Trunks of small to medium diameter are often usable without splitting, although the dried wood does split easily. A fence row given over to elm trees will also become a natural nursery for other trees and even berry bushes that grow in your area, thus providing a variety of potential firewood as well as wildlife food and shelter. An added bonus of having dying elms on your land is that you may sometimes find morels - highly prized, edible, springtime mushrooms - growing around the trees. American elm may not rank up there with prime oak firewood, but it is still a very adequate fuel.</p><p><em>TERRY MORGAN<br />Cuba City, Wisconsin</em></p><p><strong>Un-knotty Solution</strong></p><p>Loosening stubborn knots is no longer a trial I have to endure while working with rope or cordage. When I spied a button hook in an Alabama antique shop, a light flicked on in my head: I slide the hook into the knot at a good prying spot, enabling me to apply a lot of pressure on a very small area of the cordage or rope. The knots loosen quickly. Even rope so tightly bound it would previously have to be cut unties with relative ease.</p><p><em>John Hendricks<br />Evansville, Indiana</em></p><p><strong>Strings and Shoes</strong></p><p>Living on a farm and feeding hay to many animals, we always have lots of hay bale strings around the barn. Over the years, some of the uses we have found for the strings are: trimming out the knots and braiding the strings into light ropes; tying the strings into plant hangers, and braiding a short piece to gates and barn doors for a better grip. There also seems to be an accumulation of horseshoes. We shape some in the shop after heating them, but most can be bent “cold” with a large vice and a hammer. A stout piece of pipe fitted over the leg or arm of the horseshoe while it is in the vise really makes shaping them easy. All of the bends we use are about a 45-degree angle. Some of the uses are handles for boxes, door handles, hooks (for hanging used hay bale stings or ropes!), boot scrapers (nailing one to the edge of the porch), and for just plain “good luck” over a door or window.</p><p><em>Earl “Red” Coakley<br />Summersville, West Virginia</em></p><p><strong>Strawberry Night</strong></p><p>The night is warm and damp, the kitchen even warmer. I could put on the fan, but then I’d block out all the summer sounds. This night, the crickets are exceptionally vibrant, frantic in a last- ditch effort to mate before summer’s heat runs out. I’m in the kitchen again, making jam. It’s not a passion I discuss with many people; most would consider it bizarre. Why after a long day in the office, of trudging through stifling Manhattan streets, why come home to spend hours in a hot kitchen? It’s because of the crickets; because of the pleasure of being alone, the only one awake in the house. Jam is fruit and sugar, boiled. That’s that. But in fact, it’s phantasmagoric, voodoo art. As the sugar melts, the fruits are pried open to release their livid, red hearts, spilling their liquid secrets. Then it’s a matter of patience. I sit and wait, stir, and go back to sit. A slow nocturnal rhythm develops as my world shrinks to this circle of light. A heady aroma wafts from the pot. I listen. The crickets are mute. I look. Outside, the dark is pierced with fireflies. Inside is the circle of light on the gleaming jars.</p><p><em>Martha Molnar<br />Yorktown Heights, New York</em></p><p><strong>Creative Composter</strong></p><p>I had an old cement mixer that I didn’t use any longer, so I decided to make a compost tumbler out of it. I attached a timer to it that comes on for 10 minutes a day and turns the materials that I have in the bin. It has made a great composter.</p><p><em>Jim Bugg<br />Curran, Michigan</em></p><p><strong>Share Your Wisdom!</strong></p><p>Have you learned some trick of the trade, secret formula or way to work more sustainably around the homestead?
