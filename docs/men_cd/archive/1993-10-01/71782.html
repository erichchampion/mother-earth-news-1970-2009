                <p><strong>      EARTH DIARY    </strong></p>        <p>      <strong>In response to rising lumber costs, advocates of      alternative building materials present their      case.<br /></strong></p>      <h5 id="byline">By George Everett</h5>        <p>      If you want to build a new house out of wood, you're in for      sticker shock when you reach the lumberyard. Lumber has      doubled in price in the last year alone, and prices may      continue to rise as oldgrowth forests dwindle and/or more      areas are declared off-limits to loggers in order to      protect endangered species. A 2 x 4 that cost approximately      $1.50 last summer now runs as high as $3. Faced with an      increase like that, a builder must choose between waiting      out the building season or constructing a much smaller      house for the same price. A growing number, however, are      driving past the lumberyard to pick up their housing      materials at the local feed store-stuffing their walls with      straw bales and avoiding wood when they build their new      homes. In the process, they are saving a wad of cash.    </p>    <p>      You can build a home for as little as $4,000 by using      plastered straw-bale construction techniques instead of      wood in your walls. In many parts of the country, straw      bales can be bought off the farm or feedlot for as little      as 504 per bale, especially in areas of the country where      straw is considered waste and is burned every year.      Building techniques are simple, forgiving, and easy to      learn. In fact, the most difficult part of straw-bale      construction may be getting past the mythology of the      "Three Little Pigs," which maligns straw as a shoddy      building material.    </p>    <h3>      Nebraska Roots    </h3>        <p>      Matts Myhrman and Judy Knox know all too well about      people's skeptical reactions. These plastered straw-bale      construction pioneers publish <em>The Last Straw,</em> a      newsletter that reports on techniques and tips for building      homes out of straw bales. The two travel the world talking      the praises of these homes, taking inventory of straw-bale      houses built around the world and directly addressing      people's questions and concerns.    </p>    <p>      In their travels the two discovered that buildings have      been constructed with straw bales in this country ever      since necessity spawned experiments in Nebraska at the turn      of the century. In the state's Sandhills, located in      northwestern Nebraska, early settlers turned to an abundant      resource (straw) to replace a scarce resource (wood) for      their homesteads. At the same time, hay balers were just      coming into common use on farms in the area.    </p>    <p>      Most of these homes were like the one built by Leonard and      Tom Scott-a three bedroom, two-bathroom,      900-squarefoot house with a 600-square-foot basement that      was finished in 1938. Many homes in Nebraska towns such as      Alliance, Arthur, and Dannebrog that have been built from      straw bales are still standing today.    </p>    <p>      Plastered straw-bale construction was also used for other      structures such as farm buildings, schools, offices, and      grocery stores. However, many Nebraskans were concerned      that they weren't living "civilized" existences in straw      homes; so when wood became easily attainable again in the      area, home builders resorted once again to traditional      stick houses.    </p>    <h3>      Correcting Myths    </h3>      <p>      Critics of straw-bale construction-many of whom would      prefer builders use wood, brick, and blocks for their      homescan tick off a list of potential hazards with the      material. They first point to the fire hazard of straw, a      combustible material in walls. Actually, straw bales are      safer than wood because the bales are compressed and tend      to smolder if exposed to fire.    </p>    <p>      In a test of the fire rating of a house built with straw      bales by the National Research Council of Canada, the      plaster surface withstood temperatures of about 1,850Â°F      for two hours before any cracks developed. According to the      Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, "The straw      bales/mortar structure wall has proven to be exceptionally      resistant to fire. The straw bales hold enough air to      provide good insulation value, but because they are      compacted firmly, they don't hold enough air to permit      combustion."    </p>    <p>      Straw-bale homes can burn just like any other house though,      and special attention must be paid to electrical wiring      details. Adding a firebreak at the top of the walls can      preclude the threat of lightning-caused roof fires or      chimney fires. Fires in older homes present problems not      because they spread quickly but because they smolder and      are difficult to extinguish. According to Matts Myhrman,      "Trying to burn a well compacted bale is rather like trying      to burn a phone book."    </p>        <p>      Another worry is that straw walls will offer tempting      nesting sites for mice and other vermin. But in plastered      straw-bale construction, the straw bales are enclosed in      plaster or stucco and offer no more enticement to pests      than a framed wall enclosed with drywall.    </p>    <p>      In addition, homes built with straw bales may substantially      reduce your energy bills. Straw is a natural form of one of      the most common residential insulations in use in homes      today: cellulose. Because bales are compact and      approximately 20" wide, they can result in thicker than      normal walls with high R-values, even more so when proper      insulation is added.    </p>    <p>      R-values, a measure of a material's thermal resistance (how      well it resists heat passing through), are established by      the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and      Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). This nonprofit      organization holds more than 50,000 engineers and others;      they establish these standards in order to encourage the      adoption of energy-efficiency measures and provide      standards with which to evaluate the industry practice.    </p>    <p>      Straw's actual R-value is approximately 2" to 2 1/2" and      can result in R-values of close to R-40 in walls of      20"-wide bales. This stacks up pretty well compared to some      of the more conventional forms of insulation. For instance,      loose-fill cellulose insulation has an R-value per inch of      approximately 3.5. Fiberglass batting has an R-value per      inch of approximately 3.2.    </p>    <p>      Normally, home builders settle for less and would not even      consider insulating a wall to the level of R-40 because of      the high cost of materials. It's important to note that the      doors, windows, and ceiling are independent of the      straw-bale construction and call for their own insulation.      (For some suggestions, see "Home Insulation for the 1990s"      on page 45.)    </p>    <p>      "The insulation factor of straw bale is definitely the key      for us," says Athena Steen, who lived in a straw-bale house      for five years in New Mexico before moving to Arizona. Her      present house, which is adobe, came with the property she      now lives on, but she plans to build another straw-bale      house soon. "The straw-bale house stayed a lot cooler      throughout the summer and a lot warmer during the winter.      We heated our house with wood, and we used approximately      half a cord for the whole winter. In a frame house we would      have used at least a full cord."    </p>    <p>      Even more energy savings is possible when solar gain is      incorporated into the home's design. The Steens, for      example, used south-facing glass and adobe interior walls      to catch and store heat from the sun.    </p>    <p>      Catherine Wanek of Kingston, New Mexico, built a wall of      double paned windows facing south that collect the low      angled winter sun when she needs extra heat. An opaque roof      reflects the overhead sun above. Catherine kept the east      and west walls solid straw bales, except for the doors and      windows.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>RECRUITING HELP: One big advantage of building      with straw bales is that practically anyone can help      out.</strong></em>    </p>          <h3>Appealing Features</h3>            <p>      Old-timers in Nebraska straw-bale homes have commented on      how quiet these homes are inside, due to the thick walls.      This is true even when the houses face howling prairie      winds. Modern strawbale structures are no less quiet, and      are probably more so thanks to better-built windows and      doors today.    </p>    <p>      Just ask the Steens. They had a creek in front of their      home that would roar loudly when the water was high. "When      we went inside the straw-bale house, you couldn't hear the      creek at all," says Athena.    </p>    <p>      Many feel that the most attractive aspect of building with      straw bales is the potential savings that comes from using      such inexpensive material. Bales are available in most      parts of the country ranging from a cost of $1.50 to $4 a      bale for those that are delivered to the building site.    </p>    <p>      A comfortable home of 2,500 square feet would require      approximately 400 bales. A house built with wood studs that      would have cost roughly $30,000 can be built for as little      as $5,000 using the straw bales. Of course, these prices      assume that you will be building the entire structure the      old-fashioned way-yourself, recruiting family,      friends, and those who want building experience for free.      Costs could jump a couple of thousand dollars if you      decided to hire outside labor for the building and      plastering.    </p>    <p>      As for its strength and durability, straw in bales has been      tested both in the laboratory and out in the field. The      proof is in the pudding: Houses built with the bales more      than 90 years ago are still standing strong as ever today.      In fact, one house located in Wyoming withstood an      earthquake that registered 5.0 on the Richter scale,      indicating that straw may just be a more desirable building      material for areas that are susceptible to earthquakes.      That house is still occupied by the same family, Charles      and Mary Bruner and their son Phillip, who was born there      and grew up in that house.    </p>        <p>      "The earthquake was in the 1970s and it was either 5.3 or      5.8, I'm not sure. But I am sure there wasn't a single      crack in the house," says Phillip.    </p>    <p>      The Bruners built their straw-bale house in 1949, the year      Phillip was born, as a "temporary" residence; they've been      living there ever since. Charles Bruner got the idea from a      neighbor who had built a storage shed using straw bales.      When asked what it was like to live in their house, Phillip      Bruner replies enthusiastically.    </p>    <p>      "You can live in this house comfortably during the summer;      it stays nice and cool. We have never needed any air      conditioning, and in summer we get days up in the 90s.      Also, last winter I only turned our small bedroom heater on      twice. If I had to guess how our utility bills compare to      those of our neighbors, I'd have to say our bill is about      half."    </p>    <p>      Compression tests have also demonstrated that straw-bale      walls can handle compressive loads several times greater      than standard wooden walls. In Tucson, Arizona, a more      detailed study is currently underway to examine the results      of tests that showed that one single bale could withstand a      load of 10,000 pounds per square foot. This would be      similar to one straw bale supporting the weight of two      dozen pickup trucks without breaking.    </p>          <h3>Working With Bales</h3>           <p>      Building a home with straw bales isn't rocket science. Some      feel the biggest plus is the pride obtained by completing      the labor without professional help. Catherine Wanek would      be the first to agree. She built her dream greenhouse      addition to her bed-and-breakfast lodge with the help of 20      people-all friends, family members, and those who      simply wanted to obtain hands-on experience.    </p>    <p>      "I was inspired after hearing about the success of Kate      Brown, a New Mexican potter who built her own straw-bale      studio;" Catherine says. She put her structure up in two      days-roof and all-mainly with the help of women      all over 60. Talk about empowering!    </p>    <p>      Even the most difficult techniques can be learned in less      than two weeks of study, and the majority of knowledge      needed can be gained in a few hours. There are two basic      approaches: using the bales to build load-bearing walls, as      the early settlers of Nebraska did, and using post-and-beam      construction to take the load off the walls, which is      preferred by code officials.    </p>    <p>      The straw bales are stacked in interlocking rows like      bricks and are often secured to the foundation with rebar,      usually one or two pieces per bottom bale. Then the rest of      the bales in the wall are secured using rebar pins or      wooden dowels. The bale walls should then be covered with      chicken wire for further reinforcement.    </p>    <p>      The last step is to smear the mesh with stucco or plaster      as finishing. Some builders have opted to leave their      strawbale structures unfinished, but these have often been      temporary outbuildings. It's a bad idea for a permanent      structure because it invites problems with fire, nesting      pests, and the unwelcome feeding frenzies of horses, cows,      deer, or elk.    </p>    <p>      Of the more than 100 plastered strawbale homes built in the      United States so far, most have been constructed in rural      areas of the Southwest beyond the jurisdiction of      building-code officials. Meeting local building codes may      not be a problem for plastered straw-bale homes planned for      rural areas, but it's important to work with local      officials if you plan to build in zoned areas in larger      communities.    </p>    <p>      Because straw-bale homes are different, code officials will      need to be convinced of the building material's durability      and safety. As David Bainbridge, restoration ecologist and      adjunct faculty member at San Diego State University,      points out, if log homes had not been built in this country      for more than a century, they probably wouldn't be allowed      by many buildingcode officials as well.    </p>    <p>      Bankers and insurance companies are another group that home      builders often have to work with if they want to obtain a      mortgage, financing for building or later selling their      home, or home insurance. A plastered straw-bale home,      especially one that is built without load-bearing walls,      should meet the same codes and qualify for the same      insurance coverage that covers other framed, stucco-covered      homes.    </p>    <p>      Another possible approach, due to the low cost of building      a house with plastered straw bales, is to avoid the need      for a mortgage by saving and paying as you go. The original      straw-bale homes were built where banks were as scarce as      wood. As these homes become more common, however, both code      officials and financiers should look more favorably on      them.    </p>          <h3>Construction:</h3>         <h3>Step 1.</h3>        <p>      The best way to start any house is by drawing up a floor      plan to visualize how your straw-bale house will look. Then      you should practice construction by building a model of      your home out of Styrofoam (a great way to reuse it). This      should be completed before you even <em>begin</em> to      select your bales. After all, it's much better to make      mistakes carving up your polystyrene model than to find out      your idea won't fly halfway into building a wall section.    </p>    <p>      When you have worked out exactly how you want your house to      come together on the model, it's time to pick out your      materials.    </p>         <h3>Step 2.</h3>        <p>      Locate a source of straw bales in your area. Bales are      usually widely available from local farmers, ranchers, or      feed-supply stores about the middle of June, when winter      wheat is harvested. Says Catherine Wanek, "Finding bales in      August turned out to be rather difficult. At one point I      even contemplated shipping in straw from Arizona or      Colorado, but I finally located a pile of oat straw in New      Mexico about 80 miles away. I'd recommend people search out      a local famer before he harvests and having him deliver."    </p>    <p>      Straw, usually wheat, oats, or barley, may include other      grasses such as rye or wheat grass. Check the bales you      intend to use, making sure they are dry and compact. When      you negotiate the price of your bales, make sure the      delivery to your budding site is included in the cost.    </p>         <h3>Step 3.</h3>        <p>      Your next step is to make the concrete footings for your      house. These footings should be made to the dimensions of      your bales. For example, you will need an 18footing for a      two-wire bale footing. If you err one way or another, it is      better to make the footings bigger. Then, you can fill any      gaps with loose straw.    </p>    <p>      If you want, you can also use bales as the form work to      contain the wet concrete for a footing. Be sure to consider      your plumbing needs before you pour any concrete. Here      again is where it is better to think through the details      with your model instead of when pouring concrete. While      waiting for the concrete to set, turn your attention to      getting ready the top plates and any framing for doors and      windows.    </p>        <h3>Step 4.</h3>       <p>      Put up temporary corner braces at each corner of the house      to help keep the walls plumb while you put them up. Seal      the footings and raise the bale walls placing window and      door frames and adding any wiring detail at this time. For      the walls, the bales are staggered like bricks starting at      the corners. The bales are then spiked together with rebar      or wooden pegs.    </p>    <p>      One method is to peg each bale above to the bale beneath.      Another method uses long rebar secured in the footing.      Bales are then skewered like shish kabobs onto the long      metal rods. Some builders carve out their windows at this      step by cutting holes in the bale walls with a bale saw or      chain saw. It should be noted that there is no one      definitive approach to this type of construction-builders      are constantly coming up with creative approaches through      experimentation.    </p>          <h3>Step 5.</h3>      <p>      When the walls are in, it's time for the top plate. Be      careful to straighten the walls here where needed as the      top plate is installed. Next, place the trusses and roof      supports on top of the top plate, and then add the roofing.      If you intend to have an attic, this is the time when you      should insulate the attic and put up the ceiling. Your      house is now safe from the weather and you can concentrate      on the details such as your floor, windows, and doors, and      any wiring details that still remain to be finished.    </p>    <p>      You may wish to let the structure sit for two weeks to a      month after putting in the walls so that you will be able      to watch for any settling. Others may wish to move right      along to the next step, which is to secure the top plate      and roof to the footings. Then cover all of the straw walls      with netting or 1" chicken wire before adding the finish of      cement plaster and stucco.    </p>          <h3>Step 6.</h3>        <p>      Before you build your own plastered straw-bale house, talk      to someone who has already gone through the process. The      next best thing is to start with a step-by-step guidebook,      such as <em>A Straw Bale Primer,</em> available from its      author, S.O. MacDonald, for $10. Write to MacDonald at PO.      Box 58, Gila, NM 88038.    </p>    <p>      Construction details that include drawings and specific      answers to construction questions are also available from      consultants Matts Myhrman and Judy Knox of Out on Bale      Unlimited (602/624-1673).    </p>    <p>      One especially useful booklet available from them is      "First-Aid Kit for Plastered Straw-Bale Construction,"      which shares the lessons they have learned by building      straw-bale homes.    </p>    <p>      Another good manual that contains construction details is      <em>Plastered Straw Bale Construction,</em> by David      Bainbridge with Athena and Bill Steen, which is available      for $12 from The Canelo Project, HCR Box 324, Canelo, AZ      85611 (602/455-5548). This manual contains an extensive      bibliography on the technology of strawbale construction.    </p>        <h3>Additional Sources of Information</h3>       <p>      To order <em>The Last Straw,</em> contact Judy Knox at Out      on Bale Unlimited, 1037 East Linden Street, Tucson, AZ      85719.    </p>    <p>      Carol Escott of Sustainable Systems Support has put out a      video entitled "Straw-Bale Construction: The Elegant      Solution" for $33 (including shipping and handling).
