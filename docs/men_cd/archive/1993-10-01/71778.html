               		<p><strong>G A R D E N & Y A R D</strong></p>    				        <p>      <em>Your fruit trees will hit their prime in five years and      will continue producing fruit until the<br /> ripe old age of      25.</em></p>     <h5 id="byline"><em>By Patricia Fletcher</em>    </h5>    <p>      From midsummer through late fall, John Hooper harvests 600      pounds of apples a year from his garden. Yet he lives in a      mild, often fog-shrouded coastal climate in northern      California-not exactly opti mal fruit-growing      weather. His orchard, consisting of 12 seven-year-old      trees, is tucked away in the tight quarters of his      backyard. How does he achieve such high production in such      a compact space without a lot of fruit-inducing chill or      summer sun? He practices the old art of espalier      (es-PAL-yay)-training dwarf species to grow in flat,      two-dimensional forms, usually against fences and walls.      "I've counted 70 apples on just one of my espalier trees,"      boasts Hooper.    </p>    <p>      The technique was developed in the 16th century, out of the      practical need for growing fruit in such marginal climates      as northern France and southern England. The early French      and English discovered that if they bent apple-tree      branches horizontally, they could direct energy away from      vigorous vertical growth and into producing spurs (those      stubby lateral branches that eventually flower and produce      fruit). In addition, by growing the tree flat against a      wall or fence, they could create a favorable microclimate      in which the wall radiated heat and provided shelter. As      they do today, growers kept the trees dwarfed for ease of      management.    </p>    <p>      "If you have a small garden but big ambitions, you can grow      fruit without having one or two trees dominate the entire      area," says Hooper, who, along with caring for his orchard,      owns a nursery dedicated to espaliered fruit trees and      ornamentals. Espalier trees produce more fruit per foot      than do ordinary fruit trees-mature forms reap from 30 to      60 pounds of deli cious-tasting fruit, from apples and      pears to peaches and pomegranates.    </p>    <p>      Some growers simply enjoy the aesthetic value of espaliered      trees, with their traditional symmetrical branch forms      resembling fans and candelabras. These forms are created by      snipping off unwanted branches and training others to move      down toward the desired position. These unique forms make      exquisite garden focal points: during the dormant season of      winter, the unusual branching patterns are revealed; during      the spring, apple trees become festooned with blossoms in      varying shades of white and pink; during the summer, the      trees go through a two- or three-week stage of dramatic      blossoming. Also, because you can train them to grow      against almost any supportive structure, espaliered trees      are naturals as living shields to hide unattractive walls,      fencing, or compost bins.    </p>    <p>      Along with pear trees, apple trees are the traditional      espalier subject because their spurs live for years      producing fruit. Espalier apple trees bear fruit at a young      age and are versatile in nature, with their supple, easily      trained new growth. However, you'll need to practice      delayed gratification because most of these trees take      approximately three years to mature and reach the desired      design. For some growers, this is too large a drawback. But      if you don't mind the wait, your patience and creativity      will pay off in the long run, with mounds of McIntosh and      pounds of Pippin displayed on beautiful, bountiful tree      forms.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE TRADE-OFF:</strong> <strong>Most espaliered      trees need approximately three years to attain the desired      design and reach maturity. If you can stand the wait,      you'll be rewarded with beautifully structured trees and      bushels worth of fresh apples.</strong>    </p>         <h3>Choosing an Apple Variety</h3>				         <p>      You'll want to consider which particular kinds of apples      will be suitable for your climate. "Among the 5,000 apple      trees grown worldwide, wherever you live, some variety will      suit your climate," assures Hooper. "Plus there are no      apple trees that are not amenable to espalier." In choosing      the kind of apple tree to espalier, be aware of the      extremes of your hot and cold climate. The chill factor is      the period of cold needed by apples and other deciduous      fruits to break their winter rest. This is an adaptive      feature to prevent plants from breaking dormancy on warm      winter days.    </p>    <p>      Apples have chilling requirements of 200 to 1,700 hours at      a temperature of 32°F to 45°F. If you live in a      southern state, however, there are apple varieties      available with low winter-chill requirements. There are      also varieties with summer heat resistance (See "Popular      Varieties" on page 50).    </p>    <p>      Your choice may also depend on the kind of symmetrical      design you'd like your tree to have. While there are many      variations, the six basic forms of espalier are "multitier      cordon," with its rows of branches growing horizontally;      "candelabra," with its vertical rows of branches growing      off a single horizontal; "palmette verrier" with its      U-shaped branching pattern; "fan;" with a radiating      branching pattern; "informal," that are more naturally      shaped; and "Belgian fence," several Vshaped espaliers      woven together.    </p>    <p>      The traditional "formal" shapes generally require more      attention than the "informal" ones, which grow in shapes      that naturally follow the tree's growing pattern.      Basically, the different styles offer design flexibility.      Of the formal styles, for instance, the multitiered      horizontal cordon takes the longest to train, but, once      established, lends itself well as a garden-bed divider. A      single cordon, grown vertically, horizontally, or even at      an angle, is the simplest espalier style and also works      well as a divider.    </p>    <p>      The palmette verrier design, with its horizontally growing      branches turning vertical at the ends, or the vertical form      of candelabra, are great if you want to plant several trees      against a structure without having them grow into one      another. The horizontal cordon shape would be an easy match      for a McIntosh's branches, which naturally grow      horizontally. A Newtown pippin would be great for a fan      shape because of its natural upright branching pattern.    </p>    <p>      "It's not imperative to make such matches between the      design and tree-it just makes training them that much      easier," says Hooper. "Pick what you like and what's      suitable for your climate, and simply realize that it's      going to take some time to mature."    </p>         <h3>Four Steps to Growing an      Espaliered Apple Tree</h3>     <p>      <em><strong>THE ONE-YEAR</strong></em>      <strong>WHIP:</strong> Once you've decided on the type of      fruit you want based on your climate and the design you      favor, select and purchase the youngest tree possible. Look      for a one-year "whip," or relatively unbranched tree,      growing from dwarf or semidwarf bare-root stock. If space      is very much at a premium, use dwarf root stock; if you      want a vigorous growing tree, use semidwarf. Buy them bare      root during the dormant season-which, depending on      where you live, can be anywhere from October to late April.      Ideally, the earlier you can get a tree planted in the      dormant season, the better the roots establish themselves.    </p>    <p>      Next, prune the whip way back (before or after planting) so      it's only 18" to 24" tall. "The trees look like pathetic      sticks," says Hooper, "but it's the only way to encourage      the growth of lower lateral branches." Nutrients would flow      to the top branches if you didn't cut back the leader and      allow an even flow of nutrients throughout the plant. "With      espalier, the whole point is to keep the lower branches      fruitful and vig orous so that the fruit is strictly within      reach of the ground:' As the tree matures, pruning and      maintenance is a snap, which is why it's often favored by      elderly gardeners or people with disabilities.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>PLANTING:</strong></em> You'll treat your      bare-root espalier no differently than any other bare root      when it comes to planting. Of course, you must give thought      to your climate and the best exposure. Apple trees need      approximately six hours of daily sunlight (southern or      western exposure is best). If your summers are extremely      hot, espaliered apple trees may need the shade and cooler      temperatures of an east wall or fence.    </p>    <p>      Deciding what surface to grow your espalier tree against      may be as simple as using what you've got. Chain-link      fences work great, as do wood fences, the walls of your      home, and trellises. You can also create your own      supportive structure with wire stretched between pipes or      wood posts treated with a preservative. Fruit trees trained      on post and wire fences will do best if they run from north      to south, allowing the western sun to penetrate.    </p>    <p>      If a trellis is not used, the tree will need to be trained      onto a supportive structure of wires. If your espalier is      freestanding, use galvanized 12- to 14-gauge wire stretched      between 4' x 4' posts. The horizontal bars of the trellis      or the horizontal wires will be spaced anywhere from 15" to      18" apart. If you'd like to emphasize a more skeletal look      for your tree, set the wires closer to 18" apart. Wires      will also be used against a fence or wall, threaded through      eye screws.    </p>    <p>      When planting your tree, allow at least 8" of space between      it and a wall or fence to ensure adequate air flow. This      also gives the trunk room to grow. Keep in mind that a tree      that fills a 4' x 4' trellis will ultimately fill an 8' x      8' space. Space your apple trees 6' to 8' apart. Of course,      if your apple variety is not a self-pollinator, you will      most likely need to plant more than one of a different      variety unless there are other varieties in your immediate      neighborhood.    </p>    <p>      <em>TRAINING:</em> Right from the start, keep the tree tied      loosely to the trellis or wires, using plastic ties or      plain cord. This enables you to train those branches to      grow in the form you want. Now and then, check that the      ties are not "choking" the branches. As the tree's lateral      branches begin to grow, you'll simply give them some      guidance.    </p>    <p>      After the first growing season, when you've gotten about      10" to 12" of growth on a branch, begin pruning certain      branches while allowing others to grow, depending on your      design. For most styles, with the exception of the fan and      Belgian fence, cut back the young branches leaving only the      best three that have grown 4" to 6" from the whip. Then      bend and train these shoots along the first wire 4" to 6".      [Note: Specific training techniques for the varying styles      are outlined in <em>Hedges, Screens, and Espaliers</em> (HP      Books, 1983)].    </p>    <p>      As the tree begins to grow, your primary job is to prune      unwanted branches as often as necessary to help develop the      basic structure. You'll get used to repeating pruning steps      each season and cutting off unwanted lateral branches that      will try to grow in a way that does not mesh with your      intended design. Every week or so, grab your pruning sheers      and head for your espaliered tree.    </p>    <p>      Again, although your apple tree may bear fruit the first      summer, you should not let it mature until the tree's third      growing season. Snip off young fruit when it grows to about      cherry size. Most of the tree's first and second years of      growth and vigor need to be focused into root, branch, and      leaf production to get it completely established. "It's      hard not to let fruit mature, but it pays tremendous      dividends down the road in the third season," says Hooper.    </p>    <p>      Even into the third season and thereafter, you'll have to      be strict about how much fruit you allow to grow. After the      petals fall, the fruit will form in clusters and, if you      leave all this fruit on, you'll inevitably reap lots of      small fruit instead of fewer nice-size ones. "People are      shy about thinning the fruit on their trees," he says, "but      you don't want mature fruit rubbing against each other."    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>MAINTENANCE:</strong></em> Hooper grows all of      his fruit trees organically. "A lot of what I do is just      look at the plants carefully," he says. "The espalier lends      itself perfectly to this because it's more opened up;      you're more likely to find things on it." Hooper uses a      petroleum-based dormant spray during the winter. In the      spring, Safer's insecticidal soap kills aphids and various      other pests.    </p>    <p>      Be conservative with fertilizer; it is possible to      overfeed. Use fish emulsion, blood meal, or blood and bone      mix, and a good top dressing around the base of the tree to      get it off to a good start. Use a top dressing of      fertilizer at the end of your winter season. "You want that      nutrient to penetrate the soil by the time the tree comes      out of its dormant season in need of a good rush of      nutrients," says Hooper. Later, only feed the tree if it      shows obvious signs of deficiency, such as yellowing      leaves. In the first season, water regularly as you would      any fruit tree, twice a week or more in hot weather.      Semidwarf and dwarf roots will continue to need regular      deep watering.    </p>    <p>      If you don't want to wait for your espalier tree to become      mature enough for you to harvest fruit or you want the      artistic design of the branches now, there is a solution.      You can purchase or mail-order espalier trees that have      been trained and already have their basic shape. Depending      on what the espalier nursery has in stock, almost any apple      variety can be shipped during the dormant, bare-root      season. You can order a tree that has been trained from one      season to six or seven, if you like. Of course, for the      die-hard do-it-yourself-ers, the very young whips are      available as well.    </p>    <p>      Whether you've raised it from a young whip or not, your      espaliered fruit tree will be at its prime at five years of      age and will offer you the finest of fruits for the      following 25 years. In 20 years, that's a ton of <em>fresh      apple pies.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: For more information, you can call Arbor      and Espalier Company at 415/626-8880.</em>    </p>         <h3>The Six Basic Espalier Styles</h3>    <p>      <strong>Cordon:</strong> Most traditional form of espalier.      Grows horizontally for a distance, lending itself well as a      garden-bed divider. Can be a single cordon, also known as      "rope," or a multicordon, generally with three tiers of      branches. The multicordon takes two to three years to reach      definition. May take longer on the East Coast because of      shorter growing seasons.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Palmetto Verrier:</strong> Vertical branching adds      nice definition between trees planted against a wall or      fence. Horizontally trained branches are gradually trained      into upright positions. Design can take up to three years      to reach definition. Fan: Suitable for areas requiring      vertical coverage; will best cover a square space. Style      defines quickly; can have clear definition within one year.      Branches angled at 45° can be raised or lowered for      greatest fruit yield.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Informal:</strong> Tree is allowed to take on a      more natural shape; requires simple pruning to keep on a      two-dimensional plane. Somewhat easier to train-simply      balance the tree's aesthetic symmetry as the branches begin      to grow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Belgian fence:</strong> Lattice effect offers one      of the most formal looking styles. Requires three trees or      more to create overlapping Vs and two modified Vs to create      finished ends. Within one year, the beginning design of     overlapping Vs is well outlined.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Candelabra:</strong> Also known as "Brooklyn      Botanical." Several vertical branches stem off one      horizontal base. Fairly easy to train and maintain.    </p>       <h3>Popular Varieties & Their Requirements</h3>    <p>      <strong>McIntosh:</strong> Most adaptable to any espalier      design; very hardy variety does well in cold climates yet      prefers only 600 hours of winter chill; fruits ripen late      in the midseason. Can be self-pollinating, but will be more      fruitful if pollinated by different apple variety.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dorsett Golden:</strong> Makes an especially nice      oblique design such as a fan; prefers only 400 hours of      winter chill; fruit ripens early: selfpollinating.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Anna:</strong> Lends itself well to any espalier      design; prefers only 400 hours of winter chill; fruit      ripens early; requires a pollinator of a different apple      variety.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Spitzenberg:</strong> Old-fashioned variety; makes      very nice palmette verriers, horizontal cordons, and fans.      Adaptable to many areas; hardy in cold winter locations      despite its low winterchill requirement of 600 hours.      Stiffer branches work well as cordon; avoid bending      vertically in U-shape or candelabra. Prefers 600 hours or      less of winter chill; has good summer heat resistance.      Fruit ripens late in season; self pollinating.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Newtown Pippin:</strong> Stiffer branches work well      as cordon; avoid bending vertically in U-shape or      candelabra; prefers 600 hours or less of winter chill; has      good summer-heat resistance: fruit ripens late in season;      self-pollinating.    </p>
