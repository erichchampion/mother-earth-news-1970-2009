                          <p><strong>      HOME INSULATION FOR THE 1990s    </strong></p>    <p>      With winter around the bend, now is the time for a complete      insulation overhaul.    </p>   <h5 id="byline">      by Charlie Darwin    </h5>     <p>      <em>"If the United States took the money... for the Middle      East-aimed Rapid Deployment Force and used it for making      buildings heat-tight, the resulting energy savings would      eliminate the need for Middle Eastern oil      imports-making the Rapid Deployment Force      unnecessary."</em>    </p>    <p>      -The Rocky Mountain Institute    </p>				    <p>      After reading the above quotation, I was reminded of the      1970s energy crisis when fuel prices skyrocketed for      cordwood as well as fuel oil. So I surveyed the heat ef      ficiency of our New England home for the first time in      years. I discovered air leaks in the foundation, mouse-nest      cavities in the attic insulation, loose caulk around      windows, worn weather stripping on doors, and a cellar      window that I must have left partly open all last winter.    </p>    <p>      If, like me, you've been taking stable fuel prices for      granted, it's time to overhaul your home insulation. We      must be prepared for the energy uncertainties of the '90s.      There are new materials, new energy codes to satisfy; and      the environmental effects of insulation to consider.    </p>    <p>      You'll recall from your school days that heat is a state of      matter-a function of the speed at which molecules      move. The more energy you impart to them, the faster they      move, the hotter they get, and the more heat they release      in any relatively cool direction. The fire in your      wood-burning stove distributes heat in three ways:      conduction, in which energy is transferred molecule to      molecule from the firebox to the cooler outside of the      stove; radiation, in which infrared rays excite molecules      in your cold feet or the living room walls; and convection,      in which air near the stove's hot surface warms, expands,      and rises to circulate through the room.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>INSULATION To reduce heat loss in winter, build      energy barriers between living spaces and the      outside.</em></strong>    </p>		    <p>      Similarly, your house loses heat in winter and gains it      during the summer via conduction (through frame,      foundation, windows, and doors), radiation (from any warm      surface), and convection (through air circulating in      looping currents inside rooms and hollow walls,      transferring energy from warm to cool wall surfaces). But      the greatest heat robber of all is infiltration, which      occurs when air escapes through leaks.    </p>    <p>      To reduce infiltration, seal the house. To reduce radiant      and convection heat loss, impose energy barriers between      living spaces and the outside-i.e., insulate. To      complicate matters, you need to keep humidity in during      winter and out during summer. However, you must prevent it      from condensing inside cold wall surfaces, which rots wood      and soaks insulation, rendering it ineffective. Install a      vapor barrier between living space and insulation.    </p>    <p>      Imagine the house as a series of shells enclosing the      living space: warm inner wall, vapor barrier, house      framing, insulation, cold house siding-and between      vapor barrier and siding, a constant flow of air to      evacuate humidity.    </p>          <h3>Controlling Infiltration</h3>					            <p>      Even the gentlest wind will create a vacuum on the house's      lee side, sucking out house air through any opening. A      contractor or electric utility can photograph areas of heat      loss using infrared film or electronic sensors. They are      especially helpful in identifying hidden leaks in log house      chinking or joints in brick or stone buildings-both      curable by caulking. (For more on insulating your log      cabin, see issue #128, Oct/Nov '91, p. 46.) But you can      locate or preempt leaks in a frame house by using a little      common sense.    </p>    <p>      Our 200-year-old house sits on a dry-laid (mortarless)      stone foundation. Last summer, I went down to a darkened      cellar and was surprised to find sunlight glinting through      a dozen leaks. I plugged them with a silicone      rubber-a caulklike adhesive that will remain flexible      for decades. (I avoid liquid styrene plastic "super caulk"      that sticks to anything and will remain flexible      indefinitely. It contains toluene, a substance that has      scrambled the brains of more than one young      "paint-sniffer:')    </p>    <p>      Then I ran a 48"-wide roll of four-millimeter-thick, black      plastic-mulch sheeting around the foundation. I stapled the      top to the clapboard siding three feet above ground level      and then secured it with inexpensive wood lath along top      and bottom, spacing it vertically every six feet. I laid      the bottom foot of sheeting flat along the ground and      placed old hay bales up against foundation and sill.    </p>    <p>      This combination diminishes the wind's vacuum effect and      keeps out snow that may drift against the house, melt, and      seep in. Soaked insulation will rot the sill or freeze and      heave the foundation. Next spring I'll remove and store the      plastic and use the hay for garden mulch.    </p>    <p>      Our clapboards and windows were so weathered that a gust      from a proper northeastern would suck little puffs of snow      into the north side of our living room. At first I covered      the whole wall with plastic, but that's old-tech. I      recently wrapped the house bit by bit with Du Pont Tyvek, a      flexible plastic membrane that's placed between sheathing      and siding in new homes. The Tyvek keeps wind from coming      in but lets moisture out. After removing old clapboards, I      stapled Tyvek over the exposed sheathing boards, placing      tape over the staples and seams. As I tore out interior      walls, I pumped silicone/latex tube caulk into seams      between sheathing boards and into cracks and      knotholes-but <em>not</em> into top and bottom of      wall cavities. Air must be permitted to flow up and through      the outer wall to ventilate insulation.    </p>    <p>      Outside, I nailed siding over the Tyvek. Had walls been      thinner, I'd have applied rigid-foam insulation board      before the clapboards went on. Or, I'd have erected      super-insulated double walls inside-a partition of 2      x 4's staggered between outer wall members. Leaving a 2"      airspace between double 2 x 4 walls filled with 3 1/2" roll      insulation gives an R-value of 30 or more. (See "Super      insulation" issue #101, Sept/Oct '86, p. 47.)    </p>    <p>      I chipped out loose beads of dried-out old caulking around      casements, plumbing and utility conduits, carefully      collecting and disposing of it. Old caulk may contain      poisonous white-led pigment. I replaced it with      silicone-latex, 30-year-life tube caulk. I use modern      aerosol foam.    </p>          <h3>Foam Insulation</h3>					        <p>      Canned foam is great stuff; it acts as both a vapor barrier      and insulator rated at R-4 per inch. The nonexpanding kind      is good for filling narrow cracks. To fill larger cavities,      there are varieties that expand from 1 1/2 to four times      the bulk that burbles out of the can. A powerful adhesive,      it sticks to any clean surface, and a $7 can is equal to at      least $20 worth of tube caulk. You can pump foam around      electrical fixtures (but not inside the outlet box), and      into inaccessible crannies. If foam oozes out of bounds,      compress it with a wet putty knife or let it harden and      trim with a sharp knife. Foam needs moisture to expand, so      spray dry cavities with a little water. Have nail polish      remover on hand to clean the jet. Foam will harden in the      plastic applicator tube provided, but I find that soda      straws serve as well, and "bendy straws" can reach hidden      cavities.    </p>    <p>      Even if your house was professionally insulated, check      inside door and window casements by using a thin pry bar to      remove trim boards. I found heat-leaking cavities around      every casement in our place. Don't pack window casements      full of expanding foam; it can swell and pinch sashes,      making them stick. Squirt in just enough to fill cavities      side to side. Once replaced, wood trim will need touching      up, but you'll get years of energy savings for your      trouble.    </p>    <p>      One warning: many canned foams use ozone-layer-destroying      CFCs or HCFCs as a propellant or expander. Look for an      "ozone safe" banner on the can. The fluorocarbon freon is      also used to expand rigid foam panels made of urethane and      isocyanurate. Freon has been replaced by a more benign      expansion gas in expanded styrene, so I look for Styrofoam      board.    </p>          <h3>Infiltration Versus Air Exchange</h3>        <p>      Back when oil cost 19 cents a gallon, homes were built to      lose their air contents several times an hour. With fuel at      one dollar per gallon, you want to seal up-but don't      overdo it. Air exchange between house and outdoors should      be at least a half-houseful an hour. If there's less,      indoor air pollution, such as the cancer-suspect      formaldehyde (used as a preservative in carpets and      upholstering), may build up. If your house sits on      radon-bearing rock, the carcinogenic gas may seep in and      accumulate as well.    </p>    <p>      Plus, with furnace, fireplace, or exhaust fan drawing out      600 cubic feet of air a minute, a too-well-sealed house may      become a vacuum chamber that can suck exhaust gases into      living spaces.    </p>    <p>      A properly vented and tuned furnace or brisk wood fire      produces little hazardous carbon monoxide. But draft from      an open window on a downwind wall or a strong drawing flue      can overpower a weaker exhaust, and "backdraft" from      smoldering wood embers or a poorly oxygenated oil or gas      fire may actually kill you in your sleep.    </p>    <p>      If your wood-burning stove draws well with a window open,      but smokes even a little when the house is closed up, you      may have a problem. Crack open a cellar window and open a      hole in the floor behind the stove for combustion air.      Better, run metal ducting from the stove to the outdoors.      If cooking odors linger too long, you can unseal the attic      door or cut small closable vents through the wall or      ceiling.    </p>    <p>      Test air exchange by closing up the house and watching      smoke from incense or a smoldering cotton string placed on      the floor. If smoke rises straight up and pools at the      ceiling, you probably have too little air exchange. If you      have any doubt, find an insulating contractor with the      equipment to analyze air pressure, air exchange, and heat      loss.    </p>         <h3>Insulating Walls</h3>      <p>      Heat energy radiates through hollow walls and is conducted      through solid framing. The air between wall studs will      develop convection currents that transfer heat from inner      to outer wall. To stop all three processes, fill the wall      with a nonconductive air-movement      inhibitor-insulation-and face it with a      radiation reflector or absorbent.    </p>    <p>      In new homes or renovations you can apply high-R-value      rigid foam with an infacing foil backing over sheathing on      exterior walls. But foam board is expensive; the most      R-value for the buck comes from mineral-fiber insulation.      In conventional frame walls with studs placed 16" in the      center, stock insulation goes up quickly.    </p>    <p>      Roll insulation backed with a kraft paper or reflective      foil-paper "vapor barrier" having staple flanges along the      edges was once universal. But foil dulls, and paper is both      an ineffective vapor barrier and flammable. Unbacked,      semistiff frictionfit batts pose less fire potential, and      you can see to fit them snugly. If using unbacked batts,      wear a respirator.    </p>    <p>      Insulating our old home was a challenge, even with the      interior walls torn off. It is framed with 6"-square studs      spaced anywhere from one to two feet apart. Using R-19      Owens-Corning pink panther fiberglass, I had to cut batts 5      1/2"-thick and 15" wide to fit horizontally between studs.    </p>    <p>      I packed shreds of insulation loosely into odd spaces at      the ceiling and floor so that the cavities would not leak      heat. Expanding foam went into narrow spaces where I      couldn't pack fiberglass easily without compressing, which      squeezes out air and reduces insulation value.    </p>          <h3>The Vapor Barrier</h3>        <p>      To keep house moisture out of the insulation, I stapled      six-millimeter, clear polyvinyl plastic sheet to the wall      framing. This must be done immediately-especially if      you don't plan to install wall paneling or drywall right      away-because exposed fiberglass can shed tiny      filaments that can cause lung problems.    </p>    <p>      To be effective, the barrier must form a contiguous,      air-proof sheath around living space. I applied clear poly      tape over staples and joints in the sheet. At the ceiling      and floor, I caulked the seam between the floor and wall      framing. Then I caulk-glued, stapled, and poly-taped edges      of the sheet to beams.    </p>    <p>      You don't want to tear out perfectly good walls when      insulating. Your best bet is to use blown-in insulation.      Loose fiber glass, mineral wool, or cellulose recycled from      newspaper and treated with fire retardants is blown through      holes drilled through hollow walls of frame buildings. If      applied uniformly, blown fiber adds R-3 or more per inch of      thickness, giving you up to R-12 in a conventional 2 x 4      wall, or R-19 in a house framed with 6"-wide studs. Don't      be tempted to rent a blower to pump insulation into your      own walls. It takes an experienced pro to remove siding,      drill through sheathing, pack insulation uniformly into all      wall cavities, and then seal the outside so it won't leak      air.    </p>    <p>      Don't bother to insulate in any manner without applying a      vapor barrier inside. Poly sheeting doesn't make very      attractive wallpaper, but interior paints such as Glidden      Insul-Aid will seal in moisture. Caulk thoroughly around      floor and ceiling moldings. Keep interior walls and      ceilings freshly painted. Today's light-colored interior      paints reflect much radiant energy. Drapes, furniture, and      wall hangings absorb most of what's left.    </p>         <h3>Roofs and Ceilings</h3>        <p>      In our latitude, the energy code mandates a minimum of R-30      in the roof or top-floor ceilings. That's 8 1/2" of      fiberglass, rock-wool, or cellulose. It can go in the roof,      in the attic floor, or both. Placing 5 1/2" (R-19) of      insulation between 6" framing in both roof and in attic      floor will give you R-40. With end walls insulated and      eaves filled loosely, snow on your roof won't melt over      rafters.    </p>    <p>      Our rafters, in contrast, did melt snow, and I found that      we had only three inches of aged insulation-much of      it mouse-holed or compacted-between ceiling joists in      the attic floor. I vacuumed and fluffed it, filled the      mouse holes, put a layer of 6" batts on top. In the part of      the attic used for storage, I covered rafters with two      layers of 1" rigid-foam R-6 panels (R-6 x 2 = R-12), and      then covered that with 1/2" plywood (R-5).    </p>    <p>      Next I insulated the attic floor by installing short      lengths of rigid-plastic vent-space baffle along eaves at      the perimeter of the insulation. If you plan to install      fiber-glass in a sloping roof, staple vent-space baffles      along the underside of sheathing to maintain      eaves-to-roof-peak ventilation.    </p>    <p>      You also need a contiguous poly-vapor barrier between      living space and the bottom of roof insulation. If      insulating be tween roof rafters only, staple poly to      rafters under insulation, double-fold and tape seams. When      insulating the attic floor, lay overlapping sheets of poly      between joists and snugged down into the spaces between      before placing insulation.    </p>    <p>      Handling insulation in hot attics is no fun. Glass fibers      stick to your sweaty skin, and can itch. To avoid handling,      rent a blower to put rock wool or fiberglass insulation      into the attic floor-but be doubly sure to use a      respirator. Loose cellulose can be blown in as well.      However, because it lays out more easily than mineral      fiber, it can be easily distributed with a rake.    </p>    <p>      Working on an unfloored attic, please don't try to hop      around on the floor joists. After slipping and pushing a      boot through the kids' bedroom ceiling, I hauled a pair of      4 x 4 plywood panels into the attic and leapfrogged them      around to provide a solid kneeling floor.    </p>       <h3>Cellar and Foundation</h3>       <p>      It seems that what's out of sight in the cellar is out of      mind as well. Many centrally-heated homes lose more energy      through a heated basement than through the roof.    </p>    <p>      Solid, heat-conducting rock, brick, and poured concrete      have only fractional R-values, and even with their open      cells covered, 8"-wide concrete blocks rate only R-1 1/4.      Newly built foundations are insulated with 1" of rigid foam      below grade, plus a collar of another inch over the      portions above ground level. In older homes, you'll need to      attach foam panels inside with metal lath or wood furring      strips. Fasten them to brick or concrete cellar walls with      concrete nails, or to stone walls with screw anchors      cemented between rocks.    </p>    <p>      It may be easier to insulate your cellar walls with rolled      fiberglass set into a floor-to-ceiling, 2 x 4 partition. As      suggested above for a sloping attic roof, place air vent      baffles behind fiberglass and a vapor barrier in front. A      raised, insulated cellar floor can prevent up to 15% of      energy loss. Allow for water drainage if walls or floor      leak even a little. (For details, see any of the books or      articles on building a rec room in the basement.)    </p>    <p>      Most unintentional cellar heat loss is due to radiation      from a poorly insulated water heater and pipes, furnace and      hot air ducts, or a long run of flue pipe. You can cure      most of the problem yourself. A blanket over the hot-water      heater can save plenty (your electric utility company may      install it free). Strips of duct tape-the real thing      from a heating supply outlet, not cheap "Duck"      tape-will seal seams in hot air ducting. You can tape      foam sleeves to insulate water pipes and install an      insulated flue between the furnace and chimney.    </p>    <p>      But fire and building codes are strict when it comes to      insulating furnaces. Consult a licensed heating contractor,      and have him install an automatic flue damper that closes      when the flame has been out long enough to exhaust      combustion gasses but keeps clean warm air from being lost      up your flue.    </p>    <p>      We only use the oil furnace to supplement wood stoves      during the depth of winter, and the unheated cellar can get      cold. To keep plumbing from freezing up, I wrapped electric      heat tape around the pipes (soil pipe leading to the septic      tank as well as the water supply) and enclosed the water      pump in an insulated box with a light bulb inside. Between      the joists under the living room floor, I installed 6",      foil backed, rolled fiberglass, with foil facing up to      reflect radiant heat back into the room. With a      fiber-pad-backed carpet carrying an R-value of over 2, our      feet stay warm during the wood-heat season.    </p>        <h3>Doors and Window</h3>       <p>      More energy can be lost through a few doors and windows      than through walls and roof combined. Small wonder; rated      at only T-0.9, a glass pane conducts and radiates energy      both ways, which is great during sunny winter days but      inefficient at night (and the reverse in summer). During      the `70s, when petroleum threatened to rise to $50/bbl (it      now sells for about $18), a number of      door/window-insulating ideas were developed-not all      of them practical. I remember one dual-pane window that      could be blown full of insulating styrofoam beads. Problem      was, getting them all out was nearly impossible, and little      white bits flecked the inner panes.    </p>    <p>      In modern energy-saving, dual-pane sashes; interpane spaces      are filled with argon or another inert gas, which, with its      heavy molecules, is less conductive than still air. A low-E      coating-a super-fine spray of reflective      metal-is applied to inner surfaces of panes. Much as      the metal grid in your microwave oven door lets light out      but keeps microwaves in, the low-E coating lets visible      light through but reflects infrared. Reflecting heat inward      in the north, and outward in the south, the low-E,      gas-filled sash has an R-4 rating.    </p>    <p>      The newest development is a window with low-E coatings on a      thin plastic film suspended in argon gas between dual      glazing and rated at R-8. New "hard" low-E coatings can      also be applied to storm windows. So, low-E main and storm      windows can combine to be almost as energy efficient as      your walls.    </p>    <p>      Energy codes require insulated doors and windows with air      and heat gaskets around casements in new construction and      major renovations. You can replace doors and windows in      your older home, but for a price that may not be repaid by      energy savings. The best multiple-glazed windows offer a      rating of R-8 and cost $150 to $350 apiece. Installation      labor can up the cost to $500 per window.    </p>    <p>      A metal-and-foam-sandwich entry door carries an R-15      rating. If used with a good, airtight dual-glazed wood or      metal-and-foam storm/screen door, the entry's R-rating will      approximate the wall's. But, such an entry can cost $1,500      or more to install. Also, when replacing any window, check      your building code. It may require that old nonwood      casements come out, increasing the whole expense.    </p>    <p>      Using costly high-tech methods isn't the only answer.      Jalousies, sunshades, lattice blinds, and awnings also help      insulate doors and windows. They are just as effective      today as sun and heat radiation barriers as they were in      Scarlet O'Hara's day.    </p>    <p>      In our cold Yankee climate, we heat only the most used      parts of the house. Each fall I cover doors and windows in      seldom used rooms with foil-backed 3 1/2" - fiberglass, and      then cover that with sheets of poly film stapled and      duct-taped to edges of wood trim. Poly goes on the outside      as well. To eliminate wind flap, I tape wood lath in a      cross pattern on the outside. With the fiberglass offering      R-13, the glass R-1, the 2"-thick layer of dead airspace      behind the poly adding R-2, and the two sheets of plastic      another R-2, I have almost R-19. Cost per window is less      than $5 and the materials are usable for years if removed      and reinstalled carefully. It's ugly but cheap and      effective.    </p>    <p>      Over windows in frequently used rooms, I screw fixed-pane,      wood-sash, storm windows snugly to the outer window-trim      boards. I've replaced the droopy felt weatherstrip with      3/8"-wide x 3/16"-thick EPDM rubber weather-gasketing      around the inside of each stormwindow frame. Sold by W. J.      Dennis & Co., of Elgin, Illinois, for over      25 cents/foot, EPDM isn't cheap. However, it is 10 times      more effective than felt or easily torn-open cell foam      stripping. Its self-stick backing adheres to any dry      surface. With a tough, closed-cell skin, it will last for      10 years or more. Not as sturdy as EPDM is the 1 1/4" wide,      self-sticking, closed-cell, vinyl weather strip used to      seal between truck beds and camper tops (Its width also      makes it useful on uneven surfaces such as the bottoms of      old window sashes.)    </p>    <p>      On the inside and outside of windows we want to see      through, I fasten window-clear plastic sheeting, which is      double the cost of semiclear poly but worth it.      Anti-wind-flap lath crosses are held on the outside with      clear poly tape. If the putty keeping glass panes in place      is maintained, the old windows are airtight and offer      R-values of 3 to 4. Thick, tight-closing drapes bring the      R-value up to 5 or 6.    </p>    <p>      More effective than drapes are window quilts: roller shades      of two layers of fiber- fill with a reflective mylar sheet      between them. Boxed at top and held by airtight guides at      each side, quilts offer an insulating value of about R-4.      You can also buy or make insulating drapes with a boxed      cornice at top, edges fastened to walls, and bottom      weighted down or on tracks to seal with the floor. They      will more than double the R-value of an old-style picture      window, sliding door, or window wall.    </p>    <p>      I'd suggest that you avoid those heat-shrink, plastic film,      indoor-window insulating kits that sell for about $3. The      film tightens up fine if you heat it evenly, but the      two-faced tape that comes with it won't come off its paper      backing unless it is fresh from the factory. Indeed, I have      yet to find a tape that won't remove paint from the walls      when I peel it off in the spring. You're better off      fastening plastic film by folding the edges of the plastic      two or three times, and then compressing it with thin wood      strips tacked around the outer edges of the window's wood      trim.    </p>    <p>      We have thick, old, wooden doors and well-insulated wooden      doors (combination storm/screen) at the entries. I taped      clear poly over both sides of the glass in both doors to      give the same R-value as an expensive triple-glazed sash.      To make an effective weather seal, I fastened EPDM to      3/4"-square wood strips and tacked it with small nails to      the insides of both door frames. Along the inside of the      door bottoms, I installed adjustable, rubber edged aluminum      floor sweeps. At night we roll "draft dogs" (fabric tubes      filled with sawdust) against the door. The fabric comes      from cutoff legs of old jeans; the sawdust comes straight      from the woodpile. When a blizzard howls, we pack them      along the door sill between the main and storm doors as      well.    </p>          <h3>Pets Don't Help</h3>       <p>      Of course, the draft dogs don't last long if our pair of      pets gets ahold of them. Some of the poly does need annual      replacing thanks to the house beasts scratching to get in      on a cold evening. I screwed scratch panels of 1/4" plywood      over the bottom half of the storm doors, but the great      fools jump up and claw the poly on top if we don't answer      on their very first howl. The tom cat hurls himself at the      plastic with all claws extended if not admitted on first      meow. By winter's end, there's as much tape as poly sheet      covering the front door and the cat's favorite living room      window. But, we all stay warm and fuel efficient at a      reasonable insulating cost.    </p>          <h3>An Analysis of Cost, Heat, and Money      Savings</h3>    <p>      We all want to conserve energy, but we also need to get the      most fuel efficiency for the dollar. Tightening siding and      caulking foundation, doors, and windows will eliminate 30%      to 50% of the heat a typical house loses to infiltration,      and do so at a negligible cost. An insulation contractor      can calculate savings from added protection, but you can do      a rough estimate yourself. Assuming you've already caulked      the house thoroughly and have some roof insulation and      storm windows and doors, multiply annual heating costs by      20% each for maximum potential cellar and roof heat loss,      and by 30% each for wall and window or door loss.    </p>    <p>      Now price needed fiberglass, foam panels, and replacement      windows and doors and calculate the costs of bringing      R-values up to snuff. Then divide costs by annual savings      to find time needed for payback. In our house, R-R windows      would add only R-2 over the R-6 of the old storms I use,      and would cost at least $2,500 (and that's if I did the      installing). I calculate that they would provide a 2/8 or      25% reduction in the window's 30% contribution to a loss of      a $1,000 cost per year. If we heated entirely with oil      )-$75 per year at best-it would take 33 years      to make up the cost. However, if we heated with a      combination of wood and oil at a cost of about $500 per      year, our great-grandchildren would still be waiting for a      full payback.    </p>
