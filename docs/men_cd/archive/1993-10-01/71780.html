                		        <p>      Finish your shed (or barn) with a plank door and sliding      windows.</p>			<h5 id="byline">By John Vivian    </h5>        <p>      SO SUMMER HAS PASSED (ALONG WITH your sunburn), you've      recuperated from building your shed with last issue's      plans, and you're rarin' to install those doors and      windows. Or perhaps you're looking to replace the ones on      your barn or other wooden-frame building. Good news: The      plan below can save you from $100 to $600.    </p>    <p>      The door is the sort you see in photos of pioneer      cabins-made of vertical wood planks held together by      a boxed Z-brace. The window, a glazed sash or solid      shutter, slides in a simple frame. Both are made with      straight cuts in stock materials and are surface-mounted;      neither requires precision carpentry. Although they can be      fastened with nails, self-tapping deck screws installed      with a power driver are easier to use and can be removed if      necessary.    </p>          <h3>The Rough Opening</h3>       <p>      Doors and windows fit into a rough opening designed in (or      sawed through) wall sheathing and the vertical frame      members, or studs, that support it. A 15" window will fit      between conventional studs placed with centers 16" apart,      and a 30" door or window will fill the space left after      removing one.    </p>    <p>      If you're only interested in building a door for people to      enter and exit through, your door can be as narrow as 24";      however you're better off with an opening that's 30" to 33"      wide, and larger if you're planning to admit a walking      tractor or garden cart. Make double doors for an opening      wider than 36" and up to 60" across. The door should be      high enough so you can get through without knocking your      hat off (6' 8" is the most common house door height, but 6'      4" is ample for most people).    </p>        <p>      The structural support provided by studs removed for the      rough is replaced by a header of two sandwiched 2 x 4s or 2      x 6 boards. These are placed on edge above the opening,      which is supported by posts of paired 2 x 4s at each side.      When cutting, make sure you won't be severing corner posts      or studs that support a horizontal carrying beam for the      roof or an upper story. If in doubt, call in a pro to      advise whether you should install A-frame supports. If wall      is sheathed inside and studs are hidden, use a magnetic      needle to locate the vertical nail line. If possible, use      existing studs to frame the door; cut sheathing so it is      the size of one new frame board's width (1 1/2" if using 2      x 4s), from existing stud so door frame will be covered.    </p>    <p>      When sawing into walls, use cheap throwaway blades (no loss      if ruined on a nail). A reciprocating saw is made for rough      cutting, but its narrow, easily deflected blade can leave a      ragged edge. To guide it, tack (fasten temporarily with a      partly sunk nail) a straight board with one edge that's      half the width of the saw's foot plate from the cut line.      Drill holes in corners of the cutout to admit the blade.    </p>    <p>      Set a circular saw to cut 1/2" deeper than the sheathing's      thickness. Get a secure footing and a firm grip on the saw.      To start the cut, tip the saw up on the front edge of the      foot plate and, moving forward slowly, lever the blade down      and into the wood. Cut slowly, pressing hard against      sheathing. Saw carefully and salvage what old wood you can;      I've paneled den walls and built picture frames from      weathered barn board. Planks come off framing with a      judiciously used pry bar, but nailed-on partide board or      plywood is hard to remove intact. Don't bother trying to      salvage interior sheathing of gypsum wallboard or plaster      (although bone-dry wood lath that holds plaster in older      buildings makes great kindling for the wood stove).    </p>    <p>      With sheathing off, mark level cut lines on exposed faces      of studs and saw slowly to leave a flat and level cut      surface (a handsaw works best). For a door, pry studs off      the sleeper (the horizontal board along the floor that      supports the studs). If sleeper juts above floor, use the      handsaw to cut out the section of sleeper in the doorway.    </p>          <h3>The Door</h3>     <p>      Being alternately opened and closed, rain soaked and sun      baked, and swung on by kids, doors lead a rough life. To      last, they must be sturdily built. Nominal 6"wide (actually      5 1/2") boards are best. Narrower boards can slip, canting      (tilting) the door, and wider boards can warp.    </p>    <p>      Don't use that silky smooth, but soft and thin, pine      shelving available at buildingsupply centers. A good choice      is outsidestored 5/4" x 6" (actually 1" x 5 1/2") decking      made of rot-resistant cedar or pressuretreated (PT)      lumber-fir or yellow pine treated with CCA      preservative. Better yet is 5/4" tongue-and-groove hard      pine, in which a 1/2" spline (wood strip) is milled into      the edge of one board so it fits into a groove in the next.      A 30" door can be made from six 4/5" x 6" x 8' T&G      (tongue and groove) planks for under $20. T&G locks      along the edges to make a solid, weather-tight door, but it      should be painted or soaked with deck preservative against      wet rot.    </p>          <h3>For Door Frame:</h3>        <p>      Cut two 2 x 4 jack studs to reach from the floor to the top      of the rough opening, narrow edges facing out. Rest them on      floor in new frame. Cut two 2 x 4s, one to fit atop the      sleeper outside of each jack stud, so they reach to the      horizontal frame member above. Fasten jack and outer studs      together (flat sides facing each other); use four 12d nails      or 2 1/2" screws. Fasten paired studs to sleeper and upper      horizontal frame member with holedmetal truss plates on      both sides Measure a header: two horizontal 2 x 4s (2 x 6s      in any structure but a low shed) laid together, on edge      with flat sides facing each other, atop ends of jack studs      so they fit snugly between the long, outer studs. Trim      lower ends of short studs above rough opening so they are      the same width as header boards. Fasten header boards      together and then to studs using truss plates.    </p>    <p>      If you are cutting into a standing wall, incorporate the      following directions to those above:    </p>    <p>      Mark and cut rough opening on sheathing using carpenters'      level and framing square to assure that the top is      horizontal, the sides are vertical, and the corners are      90°. In Step A, place studs at cut edge of sleeper with      their inner edges flush to margin of rough cut in      sheathing. For Step E2, trim short wall studs above rough      by the width of header. After fastening header boards to      studs, fasten them to sheathing every 4".    </p>         <h3>To Build Door:</h3>        <p>      The door is hinged to the outside of the building. Planks      are cut to length and tacked to sheathing. The door is      framed in place working through the door opening.    </p>    <p>      Attach frame boards to planks with fasteners inserted from      the inside-out, and attach externally mounted hardware with      unremovable one-way screws or lock nuts. This will keep      your eight-year-old (or others) from disassembling the door      and taking the lawn tractor for a joy ride.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Steps for construction:</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      A. Select enough vertical door boards so their combined      width would fill the rough opening, plus at least 5" from      side to side. They should be at least 3" longer than the      rough is high.    </p>    <p>      Trim ends square and so they are 2" longer than rough      opening is high. Trim outer long edges of the two side      boards equally so the total breadth of door is 4" wider      than the rough.    </p>    <p>      B. Tack a length of 2 x 4 to the floor inside rough      opening, front edge even with edge of floor. This will      serve as a support cleat to hold bottom of door boards.    </p>    <p>      C. Set door boards square and centered over outside of      rough cutout, bottoms resting against cleat and just a hair      above the floor inside. Tack to sheathing at top and sides.      Tack bottoms to cleat.    </p>    <p>      D. Working inside the building, make door frame from 1 x 4      stock.    </p>    <p>      Cut four boards to frame inside top, bottom, and sides of      door. Set frame boards 1/4" in from sills and header, and      cut corner joints at 45° for best looks and strength.    </p>    <p>      E. Fasten border/frame to door planks from the inside with      drywall screws long enough so they don't quite pierce outer      trim boards. Set screws 1/2" from inner edges, two to a      plank at top and bottom, and every 6" down sides.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>DOOR ABUSE: Doors take a rough beating, between      the rain pouring down on them and kids swinging on them.      You're best bet is to build with a sturdy, 6"-thick      wood.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      F. Fashion a diagonal brace from a 1 x 4. Angle down from      the top of the latch side of the door to the bottom of the      hinge side. Cut snug, with corners at a 90° angle so      ends butt equally to both top and side frame boards. Fasten      from inside using two screws to a plank.    </p>         <h3>For External Trim to Border Door:</h3>      <p>      A. Cut 4"- to 6"-wide boards the same thickness as the door      to frame outer sides and top of door opening. Top board      should extend across top of side boards.    </p>    <p>      B. Fasten trim to sheathing, inner edges 1/4" from edges of      door. A double row of screws set every 4" down trim      (through sheathing and into studs) is especially important      on the hinge side.    </p>    <p>      C. Hang door to trim using three flat hinges, one set at      mid-door and the others 8" to 10" from top and bottom.    </p>    <p>      D. Fasten latch to door.    </p>    <p>      E. Fasten latch plate to adjoining trim so latch fastens      securely.    </p>    <p>      Finally, remove tacks holding door to sheathing and cleat      in door sill. Open door and remove cleat. Trim below door      if building lacks skirt boards.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Selecting hardware and fasteners:</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Don't cheapen the looks of your handcrafted door with shiny      metal "economy price" latches and hinges sold in shrink      packs. The little screws that come with them are worthless,      and the thinly plated steel will show rust the second year.      Heavyduty, hot-dip galvanized hinges will hold up but will      make your door look like a field gate. I'd suggest buying      black-iron hardware costing just a few dollars more.    </p>          <h3>For Double Doors:</h3>    <p>      (Install double doors in any rough opening much wider than      36".)    </p>    <p>      A. Measure, cut, and assemble as if making a pair of      opposed single doors.    </p>    <p>      1. If using T&G, trim 1/2" off the inside edges of      inner boards and off the outer edge of outside boards on      each door.    </p>    <p>      B. Leave a 1/4" seam between the two middle boards (seam      located at center of cutout).    </p>    <p>      C. Frame doors individually and fasten Z-braces angling      down from inner latch to outside hinge sides in a pyramid      configuration.    </p>    <p>      D. Outside, fasten a 1 x 4 closing strip along inner edge      of right-hand door so it juts out 1 1/2" to overlap and      close the lefthand door.    </p>    <p>      E. Fasten trim boards around doors, and hinge both doors.    </p>    <p>      F. Fix latch to closing strip on righthand door and latch      plate to a block of wood on left door.    </p>    <p>      G. Put a D-shaped handle on the lefthand door.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Selecting hardware and fasteners:</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Butterfly-type flat hinges will do for lightweight doors.      Use long strap or T-hinges if door takes much effort to      lift. With heavy doors, fasten 2 x 4 stiffeners between      studs inside sheathing behind hinges; fasten hinges with      screws long enough to bite into the 2 x 4s.    </p>    <p>      Secure double doors by affixing large, gate-size throw      bolts (vertically) to top and bottom of door without the      closing strip. Drill holes in header and floor to accept      extended bolt. Buy a latch that accepts a padlock.    </p>         <h3>A Sliding Window</h3>       <p>      Windows too can be installed into an opening cut into a      standing wall. A wood/glass window sash, a sheet of clear      plastic glazing, or a metal-framed glass pane from an old      storm door can be fixed, hinged on any side, or put in a      pair of channels to slide back and forth. Make them any      size you like, but 24" square is good for a small shed. Put      one or two windows in the wall if you have an endlocated      door, one to each side of a central door. Cut the rough      opening 2" smaller in both dimensions than the window      frame.    </p>    <p>      Frame a window opening that displaces wall studs with      doubled studs at the side and 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 header at top      (as for door). Trim short (cripple) studs below rough by 1      1/2" so you can install a single 2 x 4 atop them-2 x      4 laid flat and cut to fit snug between jack studs. All      around, align inner edges of frame even with edges of      cutout. Nail frame joints; from the outside, fasten frame      to sheathing every 4".    </p>      <h3>For Shutter:</h3>        <p>      Your tiller or lawn chairs don't need light to see by, and      glazed windows aren't essential in a barn or shed. A      shutter, cheaper and less fragile, will serve as well.    </p>    <p>      A. Cut shutter to be longer and wider by 2" than rough      opening. Make it of plywood or of horizontally butted      T&G boards; trim away milled edges at top and bottom      trimmed. Half-inch, outside-glued plywood alone will make a      stiff shutter, but fasten two squares of 3/8" or 1/4" ply      together.    </p>    <p>      B. Frame it to join several boards or to keep plywood from      warping.    </p>    <p>      1. On a flat worktable, arrange boards horizontally.    </p>    <p>      2. Fasten with a boxed Z-frame of 1" x 3" boards. This is      similar to a door, but locate top and bottom frame boards a      good 1" from the upper and lower edges, leaving a lip to      slide in the channels.    </p>      <h3>For Frame:</h3>    <p>      Build a pair of channels for the shutter to slide in. For      greatest security, fasten with screws from inside.    </p>    <p>      A. Center window or shutter, frame facing out, over rough      opening. Tack it on level, setting tack nails through      middle of sides. If tacking a glazed, wood-framed sash,      drill pilot holes at outer edges of frame, using small      nails.    </p>    <p>      B. Make slides. From a 2 x 4 or by layering scrap plywood      (better), fashion two wood strips-in length, 2" more      than twice the window's width, 2" wide, and thicker than      window frame by 1/4".    </p>    <p>      1. Fasten one strip to sheathing along bottom of tacked-on      shutter, one end even with edge of window, longer end      extending out along slide path. Hold a straightedge and      carpenters' level under to assure that strip remains      straight, and level all. 2. Fasten the other strip 1/4"      above window, ends even with lower strip.    </p>    <p>      C. Put vertical stop blocks at each end of the strips.    </p>    <p>      D. Cut two keeper boards of 1 "-thick lumber (or 1/2"      plywood) as long as strips, but 1" wider.    </p>    <p>      1. Fasten them atop strips so they hold window in.    </p>    <p>      E. Remove tack nails; window will slide freely in the      frame.    </p>    <p>      F. Fasten a thin strip of aluminum flashing (like a roof      over the top of an upper channel). This will keep water      from swelling the wood so shutter binds.    </p>    <p>      To secure a sliding window or shutter, drill a slightly      down-sloping hole through sheathing, through lower edge of      window sash or shutter, and into the keeper board. Close      window, put a nail into hole, and window will stay closed.    </p>
