Low-cost wind power hits market.</strong>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">	      <em>by Donna Fischer</em><br />    </h5>        			<p>				when the sun doesn't shine, the cooler      temperatures help to create a breeze that can be put to      work turning a wind turbine.<br />      <br />      You're probably aware of the huge wind farms that provide      supplemental power to Los Angeles and power entire cities      in other countries. I'm excited about the potential for      large-scale wind power plants for cities, and in my      community I have already begun to see the potential of wind      power for the small system do-it-yourselfer.<br />      <br />      After apprenticing as an electrician and studying at the      Carbondale, Colorado-based Solar Energy International-a      nonprofit organization that provides renewable energies      education and technical assistance-I started Amazon Power      in 1993 and began installing solar in the area. As my      clients took an interest in wind, I began installing wind      generators to supplement many solar systems.</p><p> These      generators are often the most sensible way to boost the      capacity of an existing photovoltaic (PV) system. A strong      wind resource can allow you to have a smaller battery bank      for storage. If you're interested in exploring the      possibility of adding a small wind turbine to your system,      read on for some tips I've gained from working with small      units manufactured to provide power to independent homes,      small schools and clinics, as well as for pumping water.</p><p>      <strong>Evaluating Wind Potential</strong><br />      -----------------<br />      <br />      First, assess your location for its wind power potential.      You can purchase metering devices and obtain average wind      speed data from the airport closest to your home. This      information is normally collected at 30 feet above ground      level, which is about the minimum height to set a wind      generator, as wind speeds are somewhat slower and are      subject to more obstructions closer to the ground.      Inversely, the higher above the ground, the more      significant the wind speed.</p><p> For a small supplemental      generator that can cost as little as $1,000, including the      tower and installation, a visual assessment of available      wind power can he sufficient. Raise a light flag, and make      it a habit to observe trees and shrubbery around your site.      If they are perpetually bent, it's a good indication of a      persistent wind. At 4 to 7 mph, you can feel the wind on      your face and leaves will rustle. At 8 to 12 mph, leaves      will be in constant motion and the flag will raise in the      wind. Wind speeds of 13 to 18 mph raise dust and move small      branches, and at 19 to 24 mph, trees in leaf begin to sway.      At 25 mph, large branches begin to move, and you've got      great wind-generating potential!</p><p> Small generators can be      mounted on a pole with guy wires. (I don't recommend      mounting a wind generator on your roof, regardless of what      some manufacturers might suggest. Even with a small      generator, noise from vibration is a problem.) Put the      generator on a tilt up pole tower to make it easier to      install and maintain This allows you to mount the generator      and connect the wires on die ground before raising the      tower-no climbing needed! Keep voltage lass down to 2% by      using large enough wire. Manufacturers will provide charts      to help determine the proper wire size for your      installation.</p><p> <strong>Evaluating Wind      Generators</strong><br />      -----------------<br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>‹Wind generators, Altamount Pass,      California</strong></p><p> <em><strong>‹ Photos: SCHAFER      & HILL/PETER ARNOLD, INC.</strong></em></p><p> About a year      ago, I installed an Air 303, made by Southwest Windpower,      for supplemental charging in a 24-volt home/ recording      studio system. The system consisted of 12 Solec 50-watt      solar modules. 18 Exide 6-volt golf cart batteries, a Trace      4024 sinewave inverter and a Trace C-30 charge controller,      with fuses and disconnects for safety. The loads in thus      system are a Vestfrost refrigerator/freezer a small water      pump, efficient lighting and a recording studio. The PV      system could have provided ample power for these loads. but      the users were unaccustomed to living with a renewable      energy system and neglected to turn off loads when they      weren't using them. After a couple of years of operating      under a perpetually low- state of charge, the hatter. bank      was suffering</p><p> Several home owners in the arc.: had already      added an Air 303 to their PV systems. This hit the market      in '95 am quickly became popular. It was inexpensive, sell      regulating and maintenance free. My client decided this the      best solution to supplemental charging of her batteries.</p><p>      Since this installation, the Air 303 has been supplanted by      an upgraded model, the Air 403, because there were some      problems with regulation. This new, improved model boasts      the same benefits as the 303, but in a more reliable and      sturdier machine. It gives the batteries a trickle charge      at as little as 15 mph of wind. It maxes out at about 35      mph, putting 600 watts of charge into the battery bank With      an average wind speed of 25 mph. which is common at this      location, it would require the addition of 15 to 20 more      Solec nodules to equal the energy output of this machine.      With a price tag of about $300 per solar module. and about      $600 on the Air 403 Coot in pole and installation), it's      easy to see why the addition of a small wind generator can      he a very attractive option for someone living with a good      wind resource.</p><p> I mounted doe Air 303 on a freestanding pole      buried in cement. If I had to do it over again today, I      would put guy wires on it, but there have been no problems      and the client is satisfied (it is only on a 20foot pole).      I installed a switch at rite bottom of the pole to stop      rotation in the event maintenance is required, and then ran      the wires into a disconnect switch. With the      self-regulation, the charge went right into the batteries      from there. The battery bank was topped off within a couple      of days and there has been a state of undercharge since.</p><p>      There's a lot about the Air 303, and its successor, the Air      403, that make them attractive for the homeowner who has      modest power requirements and a site with some wind      resource available. I like the lightweight, easy      installation and self regulating features, not to mention      the fact that they are virtually maintenance free. Keep in      mind that the smaller the unit is, the faster it has to      turn to put out the same amount of power as a larger one.      This can lead to overheating and premature wear, as was a      problem with the Air 303. It appears that Southwest      Windpower has made several changes in the Air 403 that      should make it a more reliable machine-only time will tell.      The folks I know who have added this machine to their      systems have been pleased with the results. There are      several models by different manufacturers that are slightly      larger and not much more expensive. Many of them have a      stronger track record after years of operation and are      worth investigating.</p><p> <strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br />      -----------------<br />      <br />      Keep in mind that anything that is up in the air and moving      at high speeds can be dangerous. Even the machines that are      supposedly maintenance free deserve a visual inspection at      least once a year to make sure nothing is rattling loose.</p><p>      Some concerns my clients have had about adding a wind      system include noise and aesthetics. As for noise, I've      worked with several owners of generators from the small Air      303 to a Jacob, 3,000-watt generator on a 60-foot tower.      The only time noise has been an issue is when the generator      was mounted on a building.</p><p> Admittedly, some people don't      like the looks of renewable energy systems. I think they're      attractive and show something about the character of the      person who will take power into his or her own hands. I'm      amazed at how often I'm asked to hide a system. Be proud!      By accepting the idea that a battery is like a bucket, and      renewable energy systems the sources that can fill it, you      will become exponentially more aware of your potential to      minimize your impact on the planet.    </p>
