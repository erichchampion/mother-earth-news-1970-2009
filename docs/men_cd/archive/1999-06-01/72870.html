            		<p>				 <strong>HERBAL REMEDIES</strong>			</p>			 			<p>					<strong>Herbal fixes for black 'n' blues.</strong>				</p>		<h5 id="byline">      By Charles Dickson, Ph.D.    </h5>        	<p>			<strong>Amazing Arnica</strong><br />    -----------------<br /></p><p>    Arnica is a native plant of Europe but was imported to    America, where it now grows wild, particularly in moist soil    conditions in mountains and valleys, at elevations ranging    from 3,500 to 10,000 feet. It resembles many other members of    the Composite family, with yellow range sunflower-like    blossoms that bloom from April through September.    Preparations of arnica were listed in the United States    Pharmacopoeia (the official listing of approved drugs in the    U.S.) from the early 1800s to 1960.</p><p> Two common names for    arnica are mountain tobacco and leopard's bane, the latter a    reference to the herb's toxicity to some beasts. It can be    fatal to humans if taken internally, so all of the safe    preparations containing arnica are intended <em>for external    use only</em> .</p><p> There are three ways to use arnica topically:    in a fluid extract, as a tea bath and as an ointment. To    prepare a fluid extract, measure out six ounces of powdered    arnica flowers, available from herbal suppliers or at some    health food stores, and add to a glass jar containing eight    ounces of grain alcohol, which can be purchased from any    distributor of alcoholic beverages. It should be 90% strength    (180 proof). Mix well by stirring constantly for about ten    minutes, screw a cap on the jar and allow the mixture to set    overnight. This allows the arnica flowers to dissolve more    completely in the alcohol. The next day, strain the mixture    using cheesecloth as a filter. Bottle the resulting fluid and    label. While this is not a pharmaceutical grade tincture of    arnica, it is very effective as a preparation for taking the    extreme soreness out of bruises.</p><p> An arnica tea may be made in    even simpler fashion by placing a tablespoon of the powdered    arnica flowers in a cup of boiling water and allowing it to    steep for ten minutes. Use a cheese cloth to filter the    undissolved powder; the remaining warm solution of arnica tea    may be applied to the bruised area. An arnica ointment is    also available for purchase at many herbal outlets and    natural food stores.<br />    <br />    <strong>Calendula Cure-all</strong><br />    -----------------		</p>        <p>      Calendula, or marigold, is a common annual found in many      backyard flower gardens. But even those familiar with this      plant may not know of its age-old reputation as a healing      agent for bruises. In fact, its use among Native Americans      dates back several centuries.</p><p> Like arnica, calendula is      intended for external use only and should not be swallowed.      It can be used in various forms as a fluid extract, tea      bath, oil or ointment. Each form has its advantages,      depending on the type of bruise or injury and your      preferred mode of administration.</p><p> You can make a homemade      fluid extract of calendula by using six ounces of dried      marigold flower petals to eight ounces of 180-proof grain      alcohol. Follow the same procedure described for the arnica      fluid extract.</p><p> A calendula tea bath can also be made in      similar fashion to the arnica tea bath and applied as a      warm solution to bruises as needed.</p><p> The ointment and oil      forms can be purchased from herbal stores. Calendula      ointment has the advantage of being easy to apply. Plus,      not only does it take the soreness out of bruises, it also      penetrates through skin layers to start the healing      process.</p><p> While calendula oil similarly possesses healing      emollients, it doesn't always have the staying power of the      ointment, which tends to stick to the skin better. However,      you can use calendula oil as a topical skin treatment just      as you would the ointment. And because it is a liquid, you      can pour it into cuts that can't handle the rubbing      friction that necessarily comes with applying an ointment.      Some of the commercially made preparations use a      combination base that includes mineral oil.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Dickson is the author of the book,<br />      Investigations in Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry      (CRC Press, 1998).    </p>
