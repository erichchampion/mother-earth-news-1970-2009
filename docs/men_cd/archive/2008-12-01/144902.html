        <p>Detroit's "Big Three" automakers came to Washington, D.C., to present their long-term viability plans to Congress, and those plans included significant commitments to fuel-saving and electric vehicle technologies.</p><p>The automakers are seeking federal loans to help maintain their financial viability through the current economic crisis. Ford unveiled an <a title="aggressive plan" href="http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29505" target="_blank">aggressive plan</a> to electrify its fleet of vehicles, including plans to offer an all-electric van-type vehicle in 2010 for use in commercial fleets, complemented by a battery-powered sedan in 2011. By 2012, the company will bring a family of hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles to market. Ford intends to invest about $14 billion on fuel-efficient technologies over the next seven years and aims to achieve a 36 percent improvement in fuel economy for its entire fleet by the 2015 model year. The company has applied to DOE's <a title="Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program" href="http://www.atvmloan.energy.gov/" target="_blank">Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program</a> for $5 billion to support these efforts, but the company is also asking for access to up to $9 billion in bridge loans. However, Ford expects to remain viable through 2009 and hopes to avoid drawing on the loan. Ford's <a title="complete business plan" href="http://media.ford.com/images/10031/Ford_Motor_Company_Business_Plan.pdf" target="_blank">complete business plan</a> is available online.</p><p>Of course, General Motors is involved in a well-publicized effort to launch its plug-in hybrid model, the Chevy Volt, in 2010, and the company also intends to employ the Volt drivetrain in other vehicles. GM <a title="plans to launch" href="http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do?domain=3&docid=50755" target="_blank">plans to launch</a> predominately fuel-efficient cars and crossovers over the next four years, investing $2.9 billion in fuel-efficient technologies and alternative fuels during that time period. By 2012, GM will offer 15 hybrid models, and more than half of its fleet will be flex-fuel vehicles, able to run on either gasoline or ethanol-rich E85. GM is seeking $12 billion in bridge loans through 2009 and is also asking for revolving credit of $6 billion that it could draw on if its sales forecast falls short. The company ended the third quarter of the year with cash reserves of $16 billion, but it estimates that it should have at least $11 billion on hand to maintain its operations. Without a federal loan, GM expects its cash reserves to fall to $10.1 billion by year's end and to fall to $3.6 billion by February. </p><p>Chrysler's <a title="long-term viability plan" href="http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPTM2OTEwOSZtZXNzYWdlaWQ9UFJELUJVTC0zNjkxMDkmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xMjE1NDYzNzY3JmVtYWlsaWQ9anJvY2tob2xkQG1vdGhlcmVhcnRobmV3cy5jb20mdXNlcmlkPWpyb2NraG9sZEBtb3RoZXJlYXJ0aG5ld3MuY29tJmV4dHJhPSYmJg==&&&112&&&http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/CommitteeHearing.pdf" target="_blank">long-term viability plan</a> is also available online.</p><p></p><hr /><h5>Reprinted from <a title="EERE Network News" href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm" target="_blank">EERE Network News</a>, a free newsletter of the U.S. Department of Energy.</h5>
