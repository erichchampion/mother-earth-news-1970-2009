        <p>I recently found a great alternative to cheap and often quick-rusting dish-drying racks. I replaced our old broken dishwasher with a newer secondhand one and reused the old dish racks as drying racks. Not only are they big enough to hold the hand-washed pots and pans, plastic ware and wooden cutting boards, they are sturdier and more corrosion resistant.</p><p>For drying cutlery, try using the silverware basket from a dishwasher.</p><p>If you don’t have an old dishwasher to replace, I’m sure you can find plenty of racks at a dump or a recycling facility that takes appliances.</p><p>Removing the top rack is simple. Take the end caps off the metal tracks, slide out the rack, then remove the wheels by finding the plastic tabs that hold them on.</p><h5>Andrew Kass<br />San Bruno, California</h5>
