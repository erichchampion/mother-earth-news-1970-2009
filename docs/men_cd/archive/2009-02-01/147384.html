        <p>Students interested in both food and sustainability now have the opportunity to study these subjects together. The University of New Hampshire (UNH) recently launched an EcoGastronomy program - the first of its kind - made to complement any primary major related to the areas of nutrition, hospitality or sustainable agriculture.</p><p>The dual major will help students set themselves apart from other professionals and incorporate sustainable practices in these fields. The EcoGastronomy program connects interdisciplinary, international and experiential knowledge, including time on farms, in kitchens and labs, plus a study abroad experience at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Italy.</p><p>The program is part of the UNH’s Food & Society Initiative, which promotes studies of local food procurement, sustainable agriculture and food system challenges.
