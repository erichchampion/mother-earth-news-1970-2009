                      <h5 id="byline">By Barbara Pleasant</h5>          <p>The peppery fire of horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) is no      slow burn. It'll flash up your nose and curl your tongue      into submission in one swift sear. As a condiment for red      meat and shellfish, grated horseradish is legendary, but      the plant's medicinal and ornamental qualities are      noteworthy, too.    </p>    <p>      Roots are the business end of horseradish plants,      traditionally they are grated and served as a fresh relish      or added as a seasoning to meat and seafood sauces.      Horseradish also enhances the flavors of salads and soups,      particularly those that feature seasonal fall vegetables      and fruits.    </p>    <p>      A native of southeastern Europe, horseradish was well known      to the Egyptians by 1500 B.C., and has been used to      represent bitter herbs on the Seder plate for the Jewish      Passover since Biblical times. It was used primarily as a      medicine by early Europeans; for centuries, the root was      rubbed on sore joints to relieve rheumatism, and pressed      upon foreheads to relieve headaches-a practice that      actually may have helped alleviate sinus-type pain.    </p>    <p>      It's a natural decongestant-if you breathe in enough      allyl isothiocyanate, a chemical in the root. That quality      may account for one of the plant's folk names, "stingnose."      If you dare to try this for yourself, hold a spoonful of      grated or "prepared" horseradish about 4 inches from your      nose, take a deep sniff (be careful!), and then put a small      pinch on your tongue. You should be breathing easier within      seconds of the sniff.    </p>    <p>      Scientists also have found that compounds in horseradish      root can kill a range of bacteria, which makes it an even      more appropriate accompaniment to a roast beef sandwich in      this era of increased concerns about food pathogens.      Although horseradish's strong taste precludes its use in      toothpaste, the volatile oils in the root also have been      found to block the growth of the bacteria that cause dental      plaque.    </p>    <p>      Sometime before the Renaissance, the peppery root became      popular as a savory meat relish in Germany. Word of its      tastiness spread from there into the Scandinavian countries      and Britain, where it quickly became the preferred      condiment for beef and oysters.    </p>    <p>      Brought to North America in colonial days, the hardy      European horseradish took root commercially by the      mid-1800s in the potash-rich bottomlands of the Mississippi      River near Collinsville, Illinois, which is close to St.      Louis. Today, more than half of the world's horseradish is      grown in that area. The other major commercial growing area      is near Chicago.    </p>    <p>      A similar-tasting plant, wasabi <em>(Wasabi japonica),</em>      also called Japanese horseradish, is a much more recent      arrival in North America. Used as a condiment with      traditional Japanese dishes, wasabi is native to Asia and      has a slightly more complex and sweet taste than the      European plant. If you are cooking Asian foods and cannot      find true wasabi, though, you can use the European      horseradish with good results. <em>(We're working on a      wasabi report for an upcoming issue.-MOTHER)</em>    </p>            <h3>      GROW YOUR OWN    </h3>    <p>      Plants of the standard, European horseradish are so easy to      grow and so interesting to look at that, if you're a      horseradish lover, there's no reason not to have some in      your yard-even if you don't have a garden. The plant      has ornamental green, strap-shaped leaves and small white      flowers that grow on long stems like the blooms of mustard,      to which horseradish is related. Purple-leafed and      variegated (leaves splashed with white) cultivars also have      been developed as ornamentals, but they are rare.    </p>    <p>      A tough perennial hardy to Zone 3, European horseradish can      persist for many years. Because it requires a period of      winter dormancy, though, it is not well-suited for tropical      and semi-tropical climates. Set out dormant roots in early      spring, planting them 3 inches deep and 12 inches apart;      the thick, nubby end is the section most eager to sprout.      Fertile soil in full sun is the best location, but      horseradish usually manages to adapt to less-than-ideal      growing sites.    </p>    <p>      The plants die back in late fall, which is the best time to      dig them. Allow the roots to dry for a few days before      storing them in the refrigerator. (Washed and placed in      polyethylene bags, they will keep for several months at 32      to 38 degrees). Leave at least one parent plant behind to      dig, divide and replant the following spring. Also, don't      worry if you decide not to dig your horseradish every year.      It will keep coming back, although the roots become woody      with age (those from 1- to 2-year-old plants usually have      the best taste). As a garden plant, horseradish is      indestructible; keep your patch from spreading out of      bounds by using excess roots for relishes and sauces.    </p>    <h3>      PREPARING HORSERADISH    </h3>    <p>      Horseradish roots do not give off their spicy punch until      they are grated or ground. As the tissues come into contact      with air, a chemical reaction takes place that creates the      volatile compounds. Adding vinegar stops this process: If      you want mild horseradish, add vinegar immediately after      you grind the root; for the spiciest horseradish, wait a      few minutes before adding the vinegar.    </p>    <p>      If you grate a large quantity of horseradish root, do it      outdoors or turn on a small fan. Otherwise, your eyes are      likely to wa ter and bum, the same way they would if you      were chopping pungent onions. For home preparation, using a      blender to do the grating is practical and less "tearful."      Also, use glassware for storing and serving horseradish; it      turns silver dishes black.    </p>    <p>      Prepared horseradish is grated raw root mixed with an equal      amount of vinegar (any vinegar works, but rice wine vinegar      brings out the clean zing of fresh horseradish well). The      mix will keep in the refrigerator for several months but as      it ages, it loses flavor and darkens, which is your clue to      make a fresh batch. Beet-based salads often include      horseradish, but crunchy slaw types, such as the fresh      carrot and apple salad featured on Page 102, benefit from a      dollop, too.    </p>    <p>      Related Articles:<br />      Work up a 'sweat'    </p><hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
