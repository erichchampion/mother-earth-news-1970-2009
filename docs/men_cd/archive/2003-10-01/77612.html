                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Braconid Wasps    </h2>        <p>      Many years ago, at a time when my wife was 8-months      pregnant, we took in a movie but were not very particular      in our choice. Two hours later, after seeing the original      <em>Alien</em> , she said, "That was a big mistake. Where      was Mary Poppins when we needed her?"    </p>    <p>      This visceral reaction to the idea of foreign "things"      living inside other animals, including ourselves, must come      from a long human history of living with the likes of      tapeworms, pinworms and scabies. Or, taking an analytical      view of the natural world, it could be described as one big      transfer of nutrients from one organism to another. Within      that simple model, unlimited ways exist in which the      materials of one organism can be borrowed or hijacked by      another. The braconid mini-wasps fit the profile; they are      insects that fulfill their life cycle by inhabiting the      bodies of other creatures.    </p>    <p>      The braconid family is in the Order Hymenoptera, which      includes other bees and wasps, but all 1,700 North American      species in this family are stingless, and so small you have      to pay close attention to see them. They can be almost      invisible, at 2 to 3 millimeters long, or veritable giants      at 15 millimeters (about 5/8 inch). Antennae will usually      be noticeable and a visible ovipositor (not a stinger) is      common to many species. Most will be black or brown, but a      few have some color. Braconids are short and      stocky-the abdomen is about the same length as the      head and thorax combined. Unlike other wasps, braconids do      not have skinny "waists." They can be confused with small      flies.    </p>        <p>      Different braconids are parasitic on army worms, eastern      tent caterpillars, corn borers, cotton bollworms, alfalfa      weevils, wheat-stem sawflies and Douglas-fir bark beetles,      just to name a few. In the garden and orchard, this      beneficial parasitism occurs on aphids, coddling moths,      tomato hornworms, garden webworms and on many different      caterpillars, beetles and flies.    </p>    <p>      The parasitism occurs in a variety of forms. Some adult      braconids will lay eggs in or on the host. The resulting      larva consume the host and then emerge to become adults      elsewhere. (The white bumps on the hornworm in the photo      above look like insect eggs, but they are actually cocoons      from which adult mini-wasps will hatch.) Other braconids,      like the aphid parasites, lay only one egg per aphid nymph,      and the invader completes its cycle and emerges as an      adult. Diversity is a strength of ecosystems, so we      shouldn't be surprised that some beautiful and harmless (to      us!) species, like the larva of swallowtail butterflies and      sphinx moths, also are hosts for braconids.    </p>    <p>      he genus <em>Aphidius</em> is of particular interest to      gardeners, especially greenhouse gardeners. These wasp      adults are only about two to three times the size of an      aphid. They lay a single egg in each aphid nymph, which      kills the aphid; then they emerge as an adult. Aphid      colonies often show different colors. Live aphids are      off-white or light green in color, while dark to light      brown bodies are likely the shells of dead aphids from      which parasites have emerged. A hand lens comes in handy      here. The presence of dead aphids means that many of the      live nymphs are likely parasitized as well, but can still      move. The braconid "alien occupation" of the host for these      species can take as little as 7 to 10 days. Females of      different species of wasps can lay from 50 to 400 eggs      each, so their effect can be substantial. Many braconid      species are sold commercially to protect different      greenhouse crops. These beneficial mini-wasps feed on      nectar from flowers. To attract them to your garden, grow      plants with tiny flowers including dill, fennel and      mints.<br />    </p>    <p>      - <em>John Stuart</em>    </p><hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
