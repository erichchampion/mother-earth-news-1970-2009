        <h2 id="subtitle">From Farms to Five-Stars</h2><h5 id="byline">By Doreen G. Howard</h5><p>Market growers and chefs are teaming up to serve fresh, local fare in restaurants across the country.</p><p>Fresh ingredients constitute the hallmark of great cuisine, and top-ranked professional chefs take them very seriously, going to great lengths to procure the best for their culinary creations. In 1993, a group of like-minded chefs founded a national organization called the Chefs Collaborative to promote restaurant offerings based on such ingredients-fresh, local, in-season and sustainably raised.</p><p>"You can't have great cuisine without using great local ingredients," says Rick Bayless, Chefs Collaborative board member and chef-owner of the Frontera Grill and Topolobampo Restaurant in Chicago. The menus at his establishments include direct references to and tantalizing hints of the links he has established with local farmers and market gardeners. Among the offerings: "Maple Creek Farm pork loin in dark, spicy, honeyed pasilla sauce with mashed butternut squash and wilted spinach;" "charcoal-seared Crawford Farm lamb simmered with guajillo chilies, roasted tomatoes and garlic;" and "braised Swan Creek Farm rock hen with roasted apples, guajillo chilies and cilantro."</p><p>All of the Collaborative's chefs (more than 150) reach out to their suppliers-market gardeners, pastured-meat producers, foragers, shepherds and fishermen-in similar ways to form partnerships that also promote fair wages for the growers, support the local economy and encourage sustainable growing practices.</p><p>"We seduce the customer first with flavor, and then we tell them about the ingredients and from where they come," Bayless says. As a result, foods now being grown regionally for his restaurants, which specialize in authentic Mexican dishes, include the menu meats, plus chipotle peppers, andouille sausage, tomatoes, onions and squash.</p><p>Bayless has taken the chef-producer relationship even further by setting up the Frontera Farmer Foundation, which provides capital development grants to small, sustainable farms serving his and other area restaurants and farmer's markets. The long-term benefits of such efforts, Bayless says, include direct participation in grower expansion, access to new and unusual crops, and a blurring of chef and grower roles for the benefit of all.</p><h3>NURTURING THE TIES</h3><p>Most chefs in the Collaborative, including 2002 James Beard Foundation award-winner Greg Higgins of Higgins Restaurant and Bar in Portland, Oregon, insist on personal links to their suppliers. They visit the farms, learn the growers' techniques and become friends.</p><p>"I look for almost a kindred relationship between plants and growers," Higgins says. "Their products seem to have something extra." Among the extraordinary ingredients he can feature in his restaurant as a consequence of these ties are Oregon hazelnuts, Rogue River blue cheese and Pacific Northwest wild mushrooms, fiddlehead ferns, truffles and huckleberries.</p><p>The wild-gathered foods are purchased from Lars Norgren, whose wild-crafting business is called Peak Forest Fruit. "Ours is a mutually beneficial relationship," Norgren says. "Greg gets ingredients he couldn't find elsewhere when he wants them, and they're fresh-only a couple of hours old. And he makes it possible for me to pay as much as I can to the pickers, who know where to find the best wild crops."</p><p>In Chicago, Bayless says of his Foundation work, "We consider the farmers who grow for us our partners, and the health of their business is important to the health of ours." The first growers to benefit from a Foundation grant, in 2000, were Bill Warner and Judy Hageman, a husband-and-wife team of specialty market gardeners. They operate Snug Haven Farm at Bellville, Wisconsin.</p><p>Among the food items they grow and sell to area restaurants throughout the winter months is fresh baby spinach, produced in heated hoophouses, some of which were paid for with Foundation assistance.</p><p>"Frontera prepaid for half their winter tomato order so we were able to build three more houses, making us sustainable," Warner says. "And, we were able to hire employees and pay them a decent wage. In time, the business has become secondary; it's the relationship that counts."</p><p>Warner and Hageman, along with members of a cooperative of specialty growers called Home Grown Wisconsin, supply Bayless and 40 other gourmet restaurants in Chicago, and Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin, year-round. The co-op growers pool their crops for weekly deliveries to the various restaurants; their operations range from a half-acre raspberry patch to a 50-acre vegetable farm. They produce such items as heirloom tomatoes; baby greens, including magenta lamb's quarter; crosnes <em>(Watch for an upcoming story on this rare root crop.</em><em>-MOTHER);</em> winter squash; berries; specialty melons; peppers; herbs; and antique apples. Eighty percent of the offering is certified Organic; the rest is certified Naturally Grown.</p><p>Co-op manager Rink DaVee, who also owns and operates Shooting Star Farm at Mineral Point, Wisconsin, says Home Grown Wisconsin members don't have to worry about finding markets, loading and unloading, or delivering their goods because the co-op assumes those tasks for them. "Our growers are good at providing variety and trying new things, and that inspires the chefs," he says. "The (chef-grower) partnership lets the growers do their thing. We get premium prices because of the quality we provide and, in turn, the farm has become connected to the restaurant menus." An added bonus; he says, is chefs and restaurant patrons now are more accustomed to and appreciative of local, seasonal foods.</p><h3>Essential Roasted Tomato-Jalapeno Salsa</h3><p><em>1</em>Â <em>pound (6 to 8) frozen or fresh plum tomatoes<br />2 large fresh jalapeno chiles<br />3 garlic cloves, unpeeled<br />Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt<br />1/2 small white onion, finely chopped<br />1/3 cup chopped cilantro, loosely packed<br />1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar (optional)</em></p><p>Line a griddle or heavy skillet with aluminum foil and heat over medium heat. Lay the tomatoes on the foil and roast, turning several times, until blistered, blackened and softened, about 10 minutes. Don't worry if the skins stick to the foil. Cool and peel off the skins, collecting all the juices with the tomatoes. While the tomatoes are roasting, heat another heavy skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add the chiles and garlic, and turn both occasionally until they are blackened in spots and soft (about 5 to 10 minutes for the chiles and 15 minutes for the garlic). Cool, pull off the stems on the chiles and peel the papery skins from the garlic.</p><p>In a food processor or blender, grind the chiles, garlic and salt into a coarse paste, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl a couple of times. Add the tomatoes and pulse a few times for a coarse-textured puree. Transfer the salsa to a serving bowl and add the reserved tomato juices. In a strainer, rinse the chopped onions under running water, then stir the onions, along with the cilantro and optional vinegar, into the salsa. Add water if necessary to achieve a spoonable consistency. Taste and season with additional salt. Makes 2 cups.</p><p>- <em>from Chef Rick Bayless</em></p><h3>NEW AND UNUSUAL CROPS</h3><p>Susan Spicer, another Collaborative member and the award-winning chef at Bayona restaurant in New Orleans' French Quarter, says one of the best aspects of her chef-producer relationships is the increase in new food products it has spawned. At her restaurant, Spicer features locally inspired cuisine drawn from the indigenous foods of the Louisiana Delta.</p><p>Local producers provide everything from pecans to rabbits to Creole mustard for her restaurant fare; she's also a regular shopper at New Orleans' Crescent City Farmers Market, where she seeks out the freshest, local food items, including wild-collected mushrooms and blue crabs caught from Gulf waters.</p><p>"The variety of things available in the last five to 10 years is phenomenal," she says. "Our farmer's market commonly has things like `Bright Lights' Swiss chard and edible flowers. When I suggested golden beets, the farmers grew them, too."</p><h3>CHEFS BECOME GROWERS</h3><p>Over time, the partnerships between chefs and growers often start to blur. "The chefs have a real interest in how we grow things," says Home Grown Wisconsin co-op manager DaVee, noting that sometimes, the chefs even end up with gardens of their own.</p><p>Higgins, in Oregon, is an avid traveler who loves to eat foods of the regions he explores, find the local crops and bring back seeds to his grower-partners. At his home, he grows his discoveries, too, in his own test garden; eventually, some of the more unusual crops end up on his restaurant's menu. Sunchokes (aka Jerusalem artichokes), purple sprouting broccoli and fava beans grow in Higgins' garden, as do 'Cox's Orange Pippin' antique apples, plums and gooseberries-all fruits used in season for sauces and desserts at the restaurant.</p><p>Other chefs plant kitchen gardens, too. Spicer grows her own herbs and arugula for Bayona, and Bayless set up an extensive indoor garden in his basement where he grows cilantro and various greens under lights in winter; outdoors in summer, he concentrates on chiles and tomatillos.</p><p>Several years ago, Tracey Vowell, the managing chef at Frontera Grill, bought nine acres near Chicago where she has begun to grow vegetables, fruit and flowers for the two Bayless restaurants, following sustainable practices.</p><p>"Rick is a very generous man and has let me develop a plan that slowly phases me out of the restaurant as I develop my skills as a farmer," Vowell says. She has made friends with the grower-partners, and they have welcomed her as a fellow farmer with as much enthusiasm as they did when she was a customer. After more than 14 years as a chef, she plans to become a full-time grower next season. Her garden already provides pea shoots, tomatoes, tomatillos, root vegetables, chiles, herbs and edible flowers to Bayless. Next year, she wants to grow huitlacoche, commonly known as corn smut and considered a great delicacy in Mexico, where it is known as corn mushroom.</p><h3>Ginger-Spiced Pumpkin Bisque<br />with Sharp Cheddar Croutes</h3><p><em>5 pounds roasted pumpkin or winter squash, cut into 1-inch pieces<br />1 quart chicken or vegetable stock<br />2 onions, peeled and diced<br />2 tablespoons minced garlic<br />2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger<br />2 tablespoons curry powder<br />2 tablespoons olive oil<br />Salt</em>Â <em>& pepper to taste<br />1/4 cup sliced green onions<br />1 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese<br />8 slices toasted baguette, called croutes</em></p><p>In a large saucepan, saute the onions, garlic, ginger and curry in olive oil over medium heat until onions are translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the pumpkin or squash, and stock. Bring to a simmer and cook until all the vegetables are tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. Puree the soup using a hand mixer or food processor, and season to taste with salt and pepper. In the oven or under the broiler, melt cheese on the croutes. Float one in each bowl of soup and garnish with green onions. Makes 6 to 8 servings.</p><p>- <em>from Chef Greg Higgins</em></p><h3>WINTER TOMATOES IN WISCONSIN</h3><p>Bayless' award-winning Mexican cuisine is based on huge quantities of fresh tomatoes for salsa; sauces and other dishes. For a time during the winter months, he bought from wholesalers who got the tomatoes from Texas, Florida and California-that is, until Wisconsin-based market growers Warner and Hageman provided him with 50 pounds of frozen, homegrown plum tomatoes to test.</p><p>"We heard that freezing tomatoes keeps their flavor," Warner says. Bayless agreed to try the produce and ended up placing a weekly standing order for 600 pounds to be delivered from the end of October to mid-May.</p><p>Warner and Hageman contracted with neighboring farmers to help them grow enough tomatoes organically to meet the order; about 20,000 pounds are harvested at their peak annually and stored in large industrial freezers. "We don't pay the farmers until we sell the tomatoes," Warner says, "but when the tomatoes are sold, the growers get premium prices. We told Bayless that it takes more space to grow the 'Amish Paste' plants so our growers would need more money, and he readily agreed." After three seasons of experimenting with various plum varieties, 'Amish Paste' has become the variety of choice (see "Cream of the Crops," June/July 2003). It's thin-skinned and meaty in texture with low-moisture content-perfect for Mexican cuisine.</p><p>At Frontera Grill, managing chef Vowell puts the frozen tomatoes in hot water to loosen their skins for removal. Then, the skinless tomatoes are placed in a large stockpot and braised until they barely start to caramelize, which brings out the sugars and heightens the flavor. The braised tomatoes are used like fresh ones for various salsas, sauces and entrees.</p><p>Doreen Howard is a freelance writer who specializes in stories on food and sustainable gardening.</p><h3>Shopping for Sustainable Seafood</h3><p>Quality, contaminate-free seafood is as important to good cuisine as fresh, organically grown vegetables, herbs and fruits.</p><p>Overfishing, habitat destruction and pollution has put our oceans-and the creatures in them-in peril. Even some fish farming, or aquaculture, contributes to genetic and chemical pollution. Chefs Collaborative members urge you to be an informed consumer about seafood, whether you choose it from a restaurant menu, catch the fish yourself or buy it at a market.<br /><br />The Chefs Collaborative's buying guide, Seafood Solutions, help chefs and the general public make environmentally responsible seafood purchasing decisions. The booklet is available from the Chefs Collaborative; 262 Beacon St.; Boston, MA 02116; (617) 236-5200; www.chefscollaborative.org . Other sustainable seafood guidelines are available online from the Monterey Bay Aquarium ( www.montereybayaquarium.org ), the Seafood Choices Alliance ( www.seafoodchoices.com ) and Audubon ( seafood.audubon.org ).</p><h3>Best Catches of the Day</h3><p>Use the list below to shop for the most sustainable seafood.
