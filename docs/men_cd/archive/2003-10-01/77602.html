                    <h3>Slash your hot water heating costs.</h3>    <h5 id="byline">By Greg Pahl</h5>        <p>      Hot water heating is one of the most efficient and      cost-effective ways of harnessing solar energy. According      to the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency      and Renewable Energy, hot water heating accounts for      one-fifth to one-quarter of an average U.S. household's      energy usage. Installing a solar domestic hot water system      can reduce your hot water heating bill by 60 percent to 95      percent, potentially saving you hundreds of dollars a year.      Invest in a solar hot water system for $3,000 to $6,000      and, in some cases, you might recoup the costs within only      four to six years.    </p>    <p>      "If someone is really interested in renewable energy, and      they want to get involved somewhere, a solar hot water      system is probably the best place to start," says Rod      Hyatt, owner of In Hot Water Heat & Power in Eden,      Utah. "It makes the biggest impact at the lowest      investment." Many states, municipalities and some local      utilities now offer tax incen tives; and rebates,      significantly sweetening the solar deal.    </p>    <p>      Fueled by the sun (think <em>free energy!),</em> instead of      fossil fuels, solar hot water systems emit none of the      pollutants and greenhouse gases-carbon dioxide,      nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides-produced when natural      gas or oil is burned. And solar hot water systems can be      used wherever the sun shines. (Of course, generally the      sunnier your location, the more hot water you'll reap.)    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Solar Swings in History    </h3>    <p>      The first commercial solar water heater was patented in      1891; within five years, about 30 percent of the homes in      Pasadena, California, had solar domestic hot water systems      installed.    </p>    <p>      Although the solar hot water heating industry had spread to      Florida by the 1930s, copper shortages during World War II      (coupled with economic incentives offered by electric      companies to switch to their hot water heaters) crippled      the burgeoning solar hot water industry.    </p>    <p>      It was almost more than a half century later when solar hit      the mainstream market again, revitalized by the OPEC oil      embargo and skyrocketing fossil fuel prices. Federal and      state tax credits of the early 1980s for renewable energy      systems gave the solar industry a major, if short-lived,      boost. Almost overnight, a huge number of companies sprang      up all across the nation to serve a seemingly insatiable      demand for a wide array of solar installations. Then, in      1986, the Reagan Administration pulled the plug on solar      incentives.    </p>    <p>      "It almost entirely killed the industry and stopped      virtually all [renewable energy] technological development      in this country," says Christel Bieri, the vice president      of marketing at Heliodyne, Inc., in Richmond, California.      Heliodyne was one of a handful of U.S. solar manufacturers      that survived the industry crash.    </p>    <p>      Today, motivated by consumer demand for environmentally      friendly and economically sound technologies, the solar      industry is witnessing what many hope will be a      full-fledged energy revolution-a switch from a      fossil-fuel based economy to a one powered by the sun, wind      and water.    </p></div>    <h3>      HOT HOUSEHOLD WATER    </h3>    <p>      I n most homes, domestic hot water (water for washing      dishes and clothes, for bathing or cooking) usually is      provided by an electric or gas-fired water heater, or      boiler or furnace that also heats the home. Heating water      with electricity is expensive and will become even more      costly as the price of fossil fuels used to generate it      continues to climb. And, although heating water with gas is      less expensive than heating with electricity, burning gas      still contributes to pollution and global warming.    </p>    <p>      In concert with an electric or gas-fired backup unit, solar      domestic hot water can reduce the requirement for      conventional water heating by two-thirds or more. The total      amount the solar hot water system can contribute depends on      your household's hot water consumption, and the amount of      sunshine the collectors receive daily and throughout the      year. In general, most solar systems are designed to meet      one-half to three-quarters of a family's domestic hot water      need. During the summertime, the system may usually meet      all of their hot water needs. On average, an efficient      collector in good weather will heat between 1 and 2 gallons      of water per square foot per day. (A solar contractor can      help you correctly size the collectors, storage tank and      backup system.)    </p>    <h3>      SMART SOLAR SHOPPING    </h3>    <p>      If you're haunted by horror stories of the 70s and '80s,      when fly-by-night installers, more interested in selling      tax credits than reliable systems, left unwitting      homeowners with poorly designed, difficult-to-maintain      systems-it's time to shed those fears. Today,      performance standards govern most active solar components,      making comparisons between products possible (see Sources,      Page 80), so when you shop, you can shop smart. Most      manufacturers warrant their systems for at least 10 years;      in many cases, the collectors and insulated piping may last      as long as your house. Since it tends to degrade over time,      the circulating fluid should be inspected every few years      by a qualified technician.    </p>    <h3>      SYSTEM COMPONENTS    </h3>    <p>      Solar hot water systems consist of collectors connected to      one or more storage tanks by piping. For active systems,      pumps, sensors and controllers may be added.    </p>        <p>      Flat-plate, evacuated-tube and batch collectors are all      common collectors; each is suited to different needs.      Flat-plate collectors (see illustration at right), with a      "black chrome" or a similar selective-surface coating,      which absorbs the maximum amount of solar heat while      minimizing radiant cooling, are the most common. Small      tubes inside an insulated aluminum box with a tempered      glass face contain either potable water or a heat-transfer      fluid; the collector absorbs and transfers heat energy to      the fluid in the tubes, which is then carried to the heat      storage tank by insulated piping.    </p>    <p>      Evacuated-tube collectors use rows of parallel, transparent      glass tubes, which are coated with a selective finish. A      vacuum inside the tubes helps the collectors achieve      temperatures between 170 and 350 degrees, which makes      evacuated tube collectors ideal for high temperature water      applications. Batch collectors are simple systems that use      one or more black-painted tanks enclosed in a      well-insulated, glass-topped box. In this design, the      collector and storage tank are combined.    </p>    <p>      Flat-plate collectors generally perform most consistently      for residential applications, yielding temperatures in a      range of 140 to 160 degrees. Thermal performance ratings      can be used to compare the efficiency and economics of      various flat-plate solar collectors (see Sources, Page 80).    </p>    <p>      To maximize their efficiency, collectors need unobstructed      southern solar exposure between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3      p.m., so site them accordingly. The collectors can be      mounted on a building's roof or walls or set on a frame on      the ground.    </p>        <h3>      <strong>TYPES OF SYSTEMS</strong>    </h3>    <p>      Water heated by the collectors may be moved through the      house with pumps (active systems) or by natural convection      (passive systems). Batch and passive open-loop systems      (which use natural convection to circulate fluid) require      little maintenance but are vulnerable to freezing. More      common active systems that use pumps and sensors to      regulate fluid flow are generally more efficient and      freeze-resistant, but require more maintenance.    </p>    <p>      In a <strong>direct or open-loop active system,</strong> a      pump (regulated by an electronic controller, an appliance      timer or photovoltaic panel) circulates heated domestic      water throughout the entire system, from the collectors to      the heat-storage tanks. With fewer components and no heat      exchanger to lose heat, direct active systems tend to be      more efficient. They can be powered by photovoltaic modules      or a simple AC pump and controller. However, because these      systems circulate water instead of antifreeze, they are      vulnerable to freezing and are not recommended in climates      that experience freezing temperatures.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Indirect or closed-loop active systems</strong> are      the most freeze-resistant. They circulate a heat-transfer      fluid (most commonly a nontoxic propylene glycol and water      mixture) that transfers heat from the collectors to potable      water held in storage tanks (the antifreeze also keeps the      collectors and exterior piping from freezing). Like direct      active systems, they can be powered by photovoltaics, too.      They have more components and are more complex.    </p>    <p>      In cold climates where freezing is a concern, solar      contractor Tom Lane, owner of Energy Conservation Services      of North Florida, Inc. in Gainsville. Florida. recommends      consumers choose from one of two closed-loop, active      systems: unpressurized drainback systems or pressurized      glycol systems.    </p>    <p>      "The most important criteria for both is that they won't      freeze and burst."    </p>    <p>      An <strong>unpressurized drainback system</strong> uses a      closed- loop of unpressurized water separate from domestic      pressurized water. When solar heat can be collected, a      differential control, which measures the difference in      temperature between two sensors and turns equipment on and      off, turns the AC circulating pump on, and water circulates      through the solar collectors. When the pump stops, the      collectors and pipes drain automatically into a drainback      tank. Hot water from the drainback tank is pumped through a      heat exchanger located in (or sometimes outside) the main      potable water storage tank. Almost all drainback systems      use a differential control and sensors to automatically      drain the water from the collector when the temperature      drops to freezing. In very cold climates, a propylene      glycol solution can be added to the unpressurized solar      loop for added freeze protection. Drainback systems      typically have the least maintenance and are the highest      performing, closedloop solar hot water systems available.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Closed-loop glycol systems</strong>  are the preferred option for extremely cold climates,      but can be installed anywhere. Instead of using a drainback      system, closed-loop, pressurized glycol systems rely on a      continuous supply of antifreeze that remains in the pipes      and collector. whether the circulating pump is operating or      not. Closedloop glycol systems often rely on a differential      controller, sensors and an AC pump. A small PV panel can be      used to operate a DC circulating pump, which runs while the      sun shines and automatically shuts itself off when night      falls or cloudy weather prevails.    </p>    <p>      Double-walled heat exchangers prevent contamination of      household water with antifreeze or other heat-exchange      fluids. Heat exchangers can be mounted outside the storage      tank or located inside the tank. Because antifreeze tends      to degrade over time, however, these systems need regular      inspections to ensure that the antifreeze solution is still      viable.    </p>    <p>      Whatever system you choose, locate the storage tank (and if      practical, the collectors) as close as possible to the      household distribution and backup system to minimize heat      loss from the pipes, and insulate the pipes well.    </p>        <h3>      REAL LIFE APPLICATIONS    </h3>    <p>      Jay Mead and his wife, Edie Farwell, recently installed a      closed-loop glycol solar hot water system in their home in      Hartland, Vermont. "We live in an environmentally based      cohousing community that has a centralized wood-fired      boiler for all the units," he says, "and we wanted to have      some kind of non-fossil-fueled augmentation for the      boiler." A solar hot water system seemed like an obvious      choice.    </p>    <p>      So far, their solar domestic hot water system has performed      flawlessly. "It's really quite amazing," Mead says. "On a      cold winter day, when the temperature outside is around      zero, the temperature of the tank registers between 130 and      150 degrees. We've been very impressed." The system's      operation is so subtle that Mead says the only way he can      tell that it's running is the faint sound of the      circulating pump.    </p>    <p>      Val Roberts and his wife, Rosalie, retired recently to a      remote home in Bancroft, Idaho, where winter temperatures      of 40 degrees below zero are not unusual. But Roberts      didn't hesitate to install a solar hot water system. The      glycol in the solar system offers freeze protection down to      50 below zero.    </p>    <p>      Besides offsetting a substantial portion of their domestic      hot water needs, the system provides some space heating.      "There are days when we get water as hot as 200 degrees out      of the solar panels, and we can heat the water tanks up to      180 degrees, which act as a heat sink for the times when      the sun isn't shining," he says. The Roberts have a valve      on their domestic hot water line so they don't get scalded.      "We're very satisfied with the system," he says. "We would      definitely recommend it to other homeowners."    </p>    <p>      Since 1979, more than 16,000 solar hot water heaters have      been installed in Oregon-certainly not the sunniest      spot in the country!-for domestic hot water, swimming      pools and spas (and many of those early systems are still      working). A typical solar hot water heater there provides      between 50 percent and 60 percent of a home's water heating      needs. Oregon currently offers a residential energy tax      credit (based on the system's performance) of up to $1,500      on certified systems. Linking tax credits or other      incentives to system performance is an important new      strategy to minimize tax credit abuses, and has widespread      support in the solar industry.    </p>    <h3>      THE FUTURE OF SOLAR    </h3>    <p>      If solar hot water systems are so popular with their      owners, even with those who live in extreme climates, why      aren't they found in more homes across the United States?    </p>    <p>      The problem isn't technical, Lane says; the technology is      time-tested and works well. Part of the problem is the need      to rebuild the industry's support infrastructure and to      strengthen educational and promotional efforts. The other      part is political.    </p>    <p>      "We could sure use more vocal support from our      politicians," Lane says. "It would be extremely helpful if      they would encourage people to adopt solar energy."    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, he is optimistic about the future of solar      hot water. "It's the best product the solar industry has to      offer, and it's going to grow in the future," he says.      "It's affordable, and from an environmental standpoint,      it's the responsible thing to do."    </p>    <h3>      Sources for Solar Domestic Hot Water Systems    </h3>    <p>      <strong>A</strong> <strong>merican Solar Energy Society      (ASES)</strong><br />      (303)443-3130<br />      <a href="http://www.ases.org" target="_blank">www.ases.org</a><br />      The ASES can help you find solar contractors and suppliers      in your area.
