        <p>I have to admit that I like the smell of fresh paint. Having lived in a collec tion of motley old apartments and homes, I loved the way a couple of gallons covered over the scuffs and stains left by the last tenants and created a "new" living space. To me, the aroma of freshly painted walls signified a clean start. But as it turns out, what my nose didn't know could have been hurting me.</p><p>That "new-paint smell" is caused by volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a class of chemicals that evaporate readily at room temperature. These chemicals are found in some pigments and also are added to alkyd oil and (to a lesser extent) latex paints to provide certain desirable working qualities, like spreadability, or to improve durability. Low-level exposure to these chemicals may cause temporary health problems, such as headaches, dizziness or nausea. Higher exposure levels, such as with auto spray booth operators, and longer exposure times can cause permanent damage to the kidneys, liver, and nervous or respiratory systems.</p><div class="sidebar"><h3>Chemicals to Avoid</h3><p><strong>Ammonia:</strong> Used as a mildewcide and as a pigment solvent. Ammonia is an eye and respiratory irritant.<br /><br /><strong>Glycol esters:</strong> Used as a solvent to help pigment mix more easily into paint bases. Can be absorbed through the skin and, with prolonged exposure, can cause organ damage.<br /><br /><strong>Heavy metals (cobalt, cadmium):</strong> Used as pigments, drying agents or biocides. These chemicals are neurotoxins and also can damage the liver and kidneys.<br /><br /><strong>Phthalates</strong>Â <strong>(dibutyl phthalate):</strong> Give the paint better spreadability. Can cause eye and skin irritation. They are toxic when inhaled or ingested.<br /><br /><strong>Tolulene (methyl benzene):</strong> Used as a paint solvent. Tolulene can negatively affect the nervous system, kidneys and heart.</p><div class="image"><p class="caption">According to the Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air is three times more polluted than outdoor air. Outgassing from VOCs contributes greatly to indoor air pollution. Outside, VOC emissions react with other hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and sunlight to create smog.</p></div></div><p>To address some of these problems, more than 20 companies now manufacture low- and no-VOC paints that perform as well as their predecessors. A number of paint products can give your home a fresh start without compromising your health. Here's an overview of some low- and noVOC paints, and a few all-natural options you can choose from for both interior and exterior painting projects.</p><h3>STICK WITH LATEX</h3><p>Although it can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals, paint still can be divided into two subcategories according to its primary solvent. In latex paints, water is the primary solvent; in alkyds, it's a petroleum solvent (oil). Latex paints, with much lower levels of VOCs, beat alkyds hands-down for safety. (Even the newly formulated alkyd paints use much more solvent than standard latex paints, and cleaning up brush es, rollers and spills after painting with alkyds requires additional solvents-latex paints clean up with soap and water.)</p><p>The biggest difference you may notice is with drying time: Low- and no-VOC paints dry a lot faster, and you'll need to work quickly so that you're always painting into a wet edge (painting over dried paint will leave a striped appearance). Because these paints tend to dry faster on rollers and brushes, cleanup may take a little longer.</p><h3>THE LOW-DOWN ON LOW-VOCS</h3><p>First, don't confuse "low-odor" with "lowVOC." Fumes from some VOCs can be masked to make a low-odor paint, which means that what you can't smell still can hurt you.</p><p>And don't assume that all low-VOC paints are created equal. A "low-VOC" label on a can means the paint meets the EPA's maximum VOC-emission standards: Latex paints must contain less than 250 grams per liter (gm/l) of VOCs; alkyds can contain up to 380 gm/l.</p><p>When shopping for a safer paint, start by reading the label. Look for paints that have VOC levels of 150 gm/l or lower. Realize that pigments, typically dissolved in chemical solvents, and other additives, such as mildewcides and conditioners, contribute to the relative toxicity of the final paint mix.</p><p>In addition to choosing a low-VOC paint, pay attention to everything else that's in the can. Because the EPA's regulations primarily focus on reducing air pollution, other toxic chemicals that do not increase air pollution, such as heavy metals, are excluded from VOC calculations.</p><div class="sidebar"><h3>Recycled Paint</h3><p>Most of us already know about local paint and household-chemical collection days, and use these environmentally responsible "excuses" to clean out our basement or garage. But did you know that you can take further advantage of these programs (and usually save bundles of cash) by buying repackaged, recycled paint?</p><p>There are two types of recycled paint products: reblended and reprocessed. <strong>Reblended paint</strong> is 100 percent post-consumer content; it contains no new resins or colorants. Originally available only in beige or brown, improved matching systems now offer a wider spectrum of colors. Although paints are screened and remixed, you're never entirely sure what types of paints have gone into the mix. Consequently, reblended paints can't be tested for wear or longevity, but they're perfect if you have a lot of area to cover, whether you're slapping paint on a barn or whitewashing graffiti off a fence.</p><p><strong>Reprocessed paint</strong> is mixed with new resins and colorants to create a product that performs about as well as new paint. When shopping for reprocessed paint, check the label to be sure that you're doing a green deed: Reprocessed paints can contain up to 80 percent new material.</p><p>The downside to choosing recycled paint is that you'll be using the older, higher-VOC stuff. But you'll be able to breathe easier knowing that you're doing the planet a favor by saving resources and landfill space.</p><p>For more information about recycled-content paints, contact your local recycling center, or visit the EPAs Web site at www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products/paint.htm .</p></div><p>Besides solvents, heavy metals and crystalline silica (beach sand) are added to paint for color or texture. These ingredients aren't a problem when suspended in liquid paint, but they are considered carcinogens if inhaled (which can occur when sanding or scraping). Ammonia is used to inhibit bacteria and mold, and to help the paint "flow" off the brush or roller. And although none of the major paint companies use lead or mercury anymore, paints with mildewcide additives still contain trace amounts of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a respiratory irritant and potential carcinogen.</p><p>For this reason, chemically sensitive individuals need to be especially careful about using kitchen and bath paints that contain extra mildewcides.</p><p>Request a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) from the paint store to get information on everything that goes into the paint. If the store can't provide one, check the manufacturer's Web site or call their customer help line.</p><h3>ALL NATURAL SOLUTIONS</h3><p>Vibrantly colored paints predate modern VOC-based paints by several centuries. The old painted walls of many buildings in Italy, Egypt and Greece attest to the fact that combinations of natural resins, oils, clays, and mineral or plant pigments can be both durable and lightfast. Today, companies such as Bioshield and Sinan have refined those ancient recipes to offer a no-VOC line of plant- and earth-based paints and finishes. (The Old Fashioned Milk Paint Company offers a casein, or milk, paint made from a mixture of lime, earth pigments and milk protein.) Because you mix them yourself, these products offer more artistic creativity. They can be applied full-strength for regular coverage, or thinned to produce a washed effect.</p><p>Because natural paints don't use the same solvents that give other paints smoothness and uniformity, they can be a little trickier to apply and tend to give walls a more handcrafted appearance. Natural paints are sometimes sold as a powder, or the pigment is sold separately from a liquid base, requiring you to do the mixing. In these cases, you'll want to make enough for one full coat: Exactly matching one batch to the next is nearly impossible.</p><p>Natural paints are not always compatible with other paint products. Milk paint works well on new wood and plaster, but can pull off old paint if it's not adhered well. Milk paints applied over latex binder (used in drywall joint compound) may "crackle." Some natural paints also waterspot easily. For walls or furniture that require extra protection, you may need to apply a topcoat of varnish or polyurethane, which means an extra step and the potential for additional chemical exposure.</p><h3>Pick the Perfect Paint</h3><p>Here's a list of low- and no-VOC paint manufacturers.
