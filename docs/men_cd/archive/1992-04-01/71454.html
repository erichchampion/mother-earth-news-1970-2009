            		<h3>      MOTHER'S KITCHEN    </h3>        <h5 id="byline">      by Mary Karenou    </h5>        <p>      The worst Easter I ever experienced was when my mother hid      my Easter basket in the planter. Shaped like a      double-measure jigger, my mother's fern sat proudly on top      of it and, well, nothing usually sat under the planter      - until that Easter Sunday.    </p>        <p>      After hours of exhaustive searching and frustration, I was      in tears as I ran around the house for what seemed like the      millionth time, resorting to such desperate measures as      looking inside boots. Taking pity on me - a      sympathetic gesture, as I fancied myself to be a      varsity-level Easter-basket hunter and was quite cocky      about the whole matter - my mother played hot and      cold until I finally had no other choice than to lift the      planter and discover my basket sitting pretty in the lower      half.    </p>    <p>      <strong>We learned two important lessons:<br />      never overestimate the frustration<br />      level of your child or the quality of<br />      store-bought treats when creating<br />      the ultimate goody basket.</strong>    </p>    <p>      After spending the better part of the morning near the      floor heaters, my chocolate bunny resembled fondue, and the      jelly beans had melted into a technicolor ooze that all but      caulked the cracks of the basket's rattan. The only      standing survivors of my Three Mile Island basket were the      mallow chicks, confections so resilient they could probably      survive a full-scale nuclear meltdown.    </p>    <p>      Anyway, we learned two important lessons that Easter: One      is never overestimate the frustration level of your child      (although I'm sure my mother got a slight kick out of      reducing this overly-confident nine-year-old to a      foot-stamping, red-eyed teary mess in a dress), and two,      never overestimate the quality of store-bought treats when      creating the ultimate goody basket.    </p>    <p>      Granted, most people don't take Easter baskets quite as      seriously as we did, but the following recipes are not only      refreshing alternatives to the usual splendor in the grass,      they're guaranteed to last hours under a planter.    </p>
