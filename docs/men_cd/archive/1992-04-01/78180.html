                <p><strong>      Natural Kitchen</strong>    </p>    		    <p>      For many people, muffin munching means strolling down the      frozen-food aisle at the supermarket or dropping into their      nearest Dunkin' Donuts. Who has time to bake? Muffins are      actually fast, easy to prepare, and a healthy alternative      to fast-food muffins, which are high in fat, sugar, and      refined carbohydrates. Versatile for any meal, muffins can      also compliment soups and stews, or liven up an unexciting      leftover. They certainly qualify as a snack or dessert item      by simply calling them cupcakes.    </p>    <p>      Your children will buy this deception until they're about      seven ! years old, at which point one of them will wise up      and whine, "But cupcakes have frosting!" So then you whip      up some light cream cheese, vanilla, and honey and smear it      on the questionable cupcake and everyone is satisfied. I've      found this beats the      "eat-your-darned-muffin-and-like-it-or-else!" approach.    </p>    <p>      Muffins will keep in the freezer for 3 to 4 weeks. A good      time-saver is to make a double batch and, while they're      baking, start another batch using a different recipe.      You'll then have 48 muffins prepared in approximately one      hour. After they're thoroughly cooled, cover each in saran      wrap and store in a zip-lock freezer bag. They can be      quickly defrosted and warmed in the microwave as you need      them.    </p>    <p>      When envisioning healthy, cholesterol-lowering muffins, one      tends to picture little brown bricks sitting solidly on a      platter. Whole-grain/high-fiber muffins can be light and      tender. Here are some hints for producing tender, cake-like      (but healthy), delicious muffins that I've found after      years of experimentation and hundreds of little bricks.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ingredients:</strong> I use whole-wheat pastry      flour for all my baking, with the exception of items using      baker's yeast. Whole-wheat pastry flour is ground from      soft-wheat berries, as opposed to hard-wheat berries used      for whole-wheat flour. The pastry flour makes a noticeable      difference in producing a lighter baked good without      sacrificing any nutrients. Fresh baking powder is a must      for baking, because whole grains are heavy. I buy the      little cans of baking powder so it's used up before losing      its potency. For storing whole-grain flours, keep them in      the freezer to help preserve valuable nutrients. Using a      culture such as yogurt, buttermilk, or sour milk produces a      tender and less-dry baked good. Even two tablespoons of      yogurt in a loaf of carrot bread will make a difference.      I've also found that when using a natural sweetener such as      honey, adding as little as one tablespoon of sugar will      produce a lighter product.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Equipment:</strong> Using an electric mixer beats      air into the baked goods, helping them to rise higher. I      use only paper muffin liners and I've discovered only one      brand of muffin pans that guarantees excellent results.      They are tin-plated pans (the Village Baker series) made by      Chicago Metallic. I use their entire line of pans for all      my baking because both aluminum and non-stick pans cause      the exterior of the baked goods to brown too rapidly, while      the inside isn't fully cooked. Natural sweeteners such as      molasses or honey cause baked items to brown faster. Using      the tin-plated pans will produce your most successful      baking results.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Method:</strong> Most muffin recipes will tell you      to fill the muffin cups 2/3 full. With whole-grain muffins      you need to fill them at least 3/4 full if you want an      attractive, dome-like muffin. To prevent dry muffins, bake      until just done (check by inserting a toothpick into the      center of a muffin; they're done when the toothpick comes      out almost clean).    </p>    <p>      These "cupcakes" are a big hit at children's birthday      parties. We topped our cupcakes with vanilla frozen yogurt      and strawberry and raspberry toppings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chocolate Cupcake-Muffins</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/3 cup canola (or any mild-tasting) oil<br />      1/4 cup sugar<br />      1 tablespoon honey<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      1/2 cup orange juice<br />      1/2 cup lowfat buttermilk<br />      1 egg 1/4 cup unsweetened<br />      cocoa powder<br />      or sifted unsweetened carob powder 1 teaspoon baking      soda<br />      2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour<br />      1/2 cup small carob chips<br />      or mini-chocolate chips 1 teaspoon white or cider      vineg</em> ar    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F. With an electric mixer, beat the      oil, sugar, and honey. Mix in the vanilla, juice,      buttermilk, egg, cocoa, and baking soda. Slowly beat in      flour and mix until just blended. Stir in carob chips and      vinegar. Pour into paper-lined muffin pans and bake 18 to      20 minutes, until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.      When fully cooled, sift powdered sugar lightly on top.    </p>    <p>      To make whipped cream, beat 1 carton whipping cream until      it starts to thicken. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla and 2      tablespoons fructose. Beat until stiff.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Carob Chip Muffins</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/3 cup canola oil<br />      1/4 cup brown sugar<br />      1 tablespoon honey<br />      1 egg<br />      1 cup sour milk<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      2 1/4 cups sifted whole-wheat pastry flour 2 teaspoons      baking powder 1 cup small carob chips - unsweetened      or date-sweetened,<br />      or mini-chocolate chips<br />      1/3 cup chopped walnuts mixed with 1 teaspoon cinnamon</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F. Beat oil, sugar, and honey. Add      egg, milk, and vanilla and beat again. Slowly mix in flour      and baking powder. Stir in carob chips and pour the batter      into paper-lined muffin pans. Sprinkle the cinnamon nuts on      top of each muffin. Bake for 20 minutes until light brown      and an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Yield: 12      muffins.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Banana Oat Muffins</strong> <em>1/4 cup brown      sugar<br />      l tablespoon honey<br />      1/3 cup canola oil teaspoon vanilla<br />      1/4 cup lowfat buttermilk<br />      1 egg<br />      1 cup ripened mashed banana<br />      1 tablespoon lemon juice<br />      1/2 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />      1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1/2 cup thin oats (quick-cooking)<br />      1/4 cup oat bran (or wheat germ)<br />      1 1/2 cups sifted whole-wheat pastry flour<br />      Chopped walnuts</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F Beat sugar, honey, and oil      together with an electric mixer.

Sprinkle walnuts on top of each muffin. Bake for      20 minutes until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.      Yield: 12 muffins.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Apple-Nut Muffins</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/4 cup canola oil<br />      1/4 cup molasses (not blackstrap)<br />      1 scant cup lowfat buttermilk<br />      1 egg<br />      1 tablespoon orange rind - grated fine<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon ginger<br />      1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 2 cups sifted whole-wheat pastry flour      2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1 apple - chopped into small pieces<br />      1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F. Beat oil, molasses, buttermilk,      egg, orange rind, and spices. Slowly beat in flour and      baking powder. Stir in the apples and nuts. Pour into      paper-lined muffin pans. Bake 20 minutes until the muffins      are light brown and a toothpick comes out clean. Yield: 12      muffins    </p>    <p>      (I discovered these muffins quite by accident when I had to      leave the house unexpectedly in the middle of preparing      them. The critical step is letting the oats absorb the      liquid for 15 to 20 minutes, which improves the texture.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oat Bran Muffins</strong> <em>1/3 cup canola oil 2      tablespoons brown sugar 2 tablespoons molasses (not      blackstrap) 3/4 cup apple juice (I use the frozen) 1/4 cup      lowfat buttermilk 1 egg 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon      allspice 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon mace or      nutmeg 1 cup each: thin oats (quick-cooking), oat bran,      sifted whole-wheat pastry flour 1/2 cup currents or raisins      (I prefer currents.) 1 teaspoon baking powder</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F. With an electric mixer, mix oil,      sugar, and molasses. Add the juice, buttermilk, egg, and      beat well. Then add all of the remaining ingredients,      except for the baking powder. Mix for 1 minute and then let      sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. The batter will slowly      become thicker. Then add the baking powder and beat until      just mixed into the batter. Pour into paper-lined muffin      pans until at least 3/4 full. Bake 20 minutes until they      are light brown and an inserted toothpick comes out clean.      Yield: 12 muffins    </p>    <p>      <strong>Blueberry Muffins</strong> <em>1/3 cup canola oil      (or any mild-tasting oil)<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      1 tablespoons sugar<br />      1 cup sour milk (put 2 tablespoons lemon juice in 3/4 cup      milk)<br />      1 teaspoon grated lemon rind<br />      1 egg<br />      2 1/4 cups sifted whole-wheat pastry flour<br />      2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1/8 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      1 cup blueberries (frozen are better)</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F.

Pour into paper-lined muffin      pans. Sprinkle the topping on each muffin. Bake 20 minutes      until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.    </p>    <p>      Topping: mix 1 teaspoon flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1      tablespoon sugar.    </p>    <p>      BACK TO NATURAL HEALTH    </p>
