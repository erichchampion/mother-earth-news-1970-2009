        	   <p><strong>     Natural Health      </strong></p>		  <h5 id="byline">      By Michael Hallowell    </h5>	      <h3>How to pick them;how to use them</h3>        <p>      In recent years there has been a tremendous surge of      interest in herbal or botanic medicine. In consequence, a      wide variety of ready prepared natural remedies have found      their way onto the shelves of herb suppliers, health-food      stores, and even some chemists. While manufacturers are to      be commended for presenting the public with an alternative      to chemicals, it's important to remember that a lot of      remedies can be made at home. While naturally treating what      ails you may seem like hocus pocus, many wonderful cures      are as common as what's found in your herb garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Collecting Medicinal Plants</strong></p><p> No matter      where you live, you will always be able to find plants that      can be cultivated for their medicinal values. Of course,      exactly what plants are available to you depends largely on      your own geographical location. Where I live, one can find      an almost endless variety of useful herbs, "weeds" (I      detest that word), and shrubs. Even in quite heavily      populated towns it is normally possible to find an      inexhaustible supply of Dandelion, Groundsel, Chickweed,      Coltsfoot, Dock, Plaintain, and Bindweed.    </p>    <p>      When collecting plants - especially those to be used      for medicinal purposes - there are several golden      rules to follow. Stick to them, and you can be sure that      the plants you pick will be of the finest quality.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RULE 1</strong> : Correctly identify the plant.    </p>    <p>      Some herbs are almost indistinguishable from others that      have totally different properties. Rosebay Willowherb      <em>(Chamaenerion angustifolium)</em> may, to the untrained      eye, look suspiciously like Purple Loosestrife <em>(Lythrum      salicaria),</em> and two members of the Figwort family      Scrophulariaceae - Yellow Lute <em>(Odontites      lutea)</em> and Common Cow-wheat <em>(Melampyrum pratense)      -</em> may also be easily confused by someone who is      gingerly taking their first herb-hunting expedition in the      fields.    </p>    <p>      Always take several illustrated pocket books with you when      you are looking for herbs that you are not overly familiar      with.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RULE 2</strong> : Never pick within one mile of a      highway.    </p>    <p>      Some plants such as the Raspberry, Blackberry, Lesser      Plaintain, Ground Ivy, and Self-Heal have a curious      affinity for the lead thrown out by car-exhaust fumes.      Plants picked by a busy roadside may contain up to 200      times their natural level of lead.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RULE 3</strong> : Always pick from the correct      area.    </p>    <p>      It is not by coincidence that you find a field covered with      a golden carpet of Coltsfoot or a meadow dotted profusely      with clumps of Plantain. If an herb is growing prolifically      in a particular area, you can be sure that the soil is rich      in the minerals and organic acids or alkalines that promote      vigorous and healthy growth. Try to pick your herbs from      areas such as these.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RULE 4</strong> : Carefully choose the time you      pick. Pick by mid-morning, when most of the dew has      evaporated from the foliage (dew-laden herbs tend to      develop mold soon after picking).    </p>        <h3>      Selecting and Picking Your Plant</h3><p>Once you have found the      desired herb growing in a suitable area, it is most      important that you select only the best specimens, and also      that you defoliate the plant in the correct manner. Avoid      plants that show any signs of damage or disease. Black      spots on the leaves, discoloration of the stem, or droopy      foliage are some of the tell-tale signs that all is not      well.    </p>    <p>      Unless you require the root of the plant, it is rarely      necessary to destroy the whole herb. The Chinese have an      old custom of only picking the "dragon's ears" or top two      leaves. Polish herbalists will always "leave some for God"      - they'll leave the rootstock to flourish again. Both      ideas are to be encouraged because they promote vigorous      growth and ensure that the species population does not      become depleted.    </p>    <p>      When removing the foliage, choose only tender young leaves      that have a healthy appearance. Old leaves tend to be tough      and battle-scarred due to exposure to harsh winters. Leaves      from biennial plants should, when possible, be picked in      their second years.    </p>    <p>      Flowerheads are particularly prone to damage, especially      from marauding insects. The best time to pick flowerheads      is in the early morning, but be sure to dry them at the      first opportunity to prevent molding. Avoid blooms that are      starting to lose their petals, as they are past their best.    </p>    <p>      Removing bark is perhaps the most delicate operation,      because if it is removed in the wrong manner, the entire      plant may die. Select the tree or shrub that you require,      then, with a sharp blade or small hacksaw, carefully remove      smaller branches from the top and outer areas of the plant.      Bark is much more easily stripped from new stemmage and      branches.    </p>    <p>      Do not attempt to remove bark from branches which are still      attached to the tree - you may accidentally "run" the      strip of bark down the trunk, and leave it open to      infection from parasites, fungi, or disease.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The best time to pick flowerheads is<br /> in the early      morning, but be sure to<br /> dry them quickly.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you have removed the parts of the plant that you      require - the leaves, stem, root, bark, seeds, or      flowerhead - store them in small cotton or muslin      bags for transportation. Never mix two or more herbs in the      same bag. You'd be amazed how two herbs that looked      entirely different in the field can look confusingly      similar on the kitchen bench!    </p>    <p>      Be careful not to crush or damage the leaves during      transportation (a wire frame placed inside the collecting      bag helps).    </p>        <h3>      Drying and Preserving    </h3>    <p>      Having collected your herbs, it is important that you      prepare them for storage as soon as possible. Every home      herbalist has his or her own techniques and favorite      methods of storing herbs, and some of them are quite      simple. The most popular means of preserving herbs is by      drying. In removing the moisture from the cellular      structure of the plant, you trap the "active principles,"      or therapeutically useful chemicals, inside. Also, the      plant is impervious to mold, disease, and other problems.      Dried herbs can - depending on the species - be      stored for up to five years with no loss of potency.    </p>    <p>      Basically, there are two methods of drying, both of which      have certain advantages and disadvantages. The quicker      - and more common - method is indoor oven      drying. The other method, which some herbalists find      preferable, is outdoor frame-drying.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oven Drying:</strong> The main advantage of oven      drying is the way in which it saves time. Herbs that would      normally take up to six weeks to dry naturally can be dried      within an hour indoors.    </p>    <p>      The herbs should be placed neatly, side by side, on a      clean, dry oven tray. A piece of aluminum foil should be      placed over the tray, with the reflective side facing in.      The foil should then be nipped to the edges of the tray,      leaving a small gap to allow moisture to escape.    </p>    <p>      Place the tray into the oven, which should be set on the      lowest temperature (150FÂ°). Remove the tray every 15      minutes and turn the herbs over to ensure that the moisture      is drawn out evenly from all sides of the plant. If      moisture is drawn out through one side more rapidly then      the other, burning may occur. Do not allow plants to burn      to a dark brown or black color. When this happens, the      potency is destroyed completely and the plant is useless.    </p>    <p>      There are two disadvantages to oven drying. First, it is      extremely easy to over-dry or burn the herbage. Remember,      you are trying to dry the herb, not cook it. When the      leaves or peals crumble gently in your hand without      powdering, and some or all of the original color is intact,      then the plant is dried sufficiently.    </p>    <p>      The second disadvantage of oven-drying is that, for various      reasons, the herbs lose between 1/3 to 1/2 of their      original potency, compared to their outdoor      dried-equivalents which only lose around 1/4.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Frame Drying:</strong> Although this method is more      time-consuming than oven drying, it is often preferred by      experienced herbalists, as the loss of potency is somewhat      less.    </p>    <p>      For frame-drying, you will need a small wooden or metal box      about 3' square, with a glass lie. The base of the frame      should be lined with aluminum foil, leaving a small,      sheltered hole for ventilation. Herbs selected for drying      should be placed on the aluminum foil, and then close the      lid. The plants should be turned once a day until dry.    </p>    <p>      The frame should, of course, be situated in an area that      receives a reasonable amount of sunlight. It should be      absolutely watertight, and all herbs placed in it should be      dried gently with a cloth first. One damp herb placed in      the frame may be sufficient to turn the entire batch moldy.      Frame drying may take anything between three to six weeks.    </p>    <h3>      Storing Your Herbs</h3>      <p>      Having successfully dried your selected herbs, you must now      consider by which method you wish to store them. This is      largely determined by the eventual form in which the herb      is to be administered. Ointments, for instance, are      normally made from finely powdered herbs, while tinctures      are usually made by submerging the whole root or leaves in      alcohol. As a rough guide, I would suggest that the leaves,      bark, and stem are best comminuted (ground), while root,      petals, and seeds are best stored whole. Be sure that your      herbs are thoroughly dried before storage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Comminution:</strong> This can be done by the      traditional method of using a mortar and pestle or by using      an electric grinder. The first method, although slower,      enables you to determine the eventual fineness of the      powder with a great deal more accuracy. But when      comminuting herbs for use in ointments or salves, an      electric grinder gives a greater degree of fineness and      uniformity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Storage:</strong> This is probably the most      important part of the whole procedure. Failure to store      your herbs correctly means that all the time and effort      spent collecting and drying has been wasted.    </p>    <p>      Choose carefully the room in which you will store your      herbs. It should not be damp, cold, or drafty. Do not store      in or near a kitchen, as cooking odors have been known to      permeate the most "impermeable" of containers! I learned my      lesson the hard way: I once opened a "sealed" container of      Lemon Verbena - which normally has an extremely      pleasant aroma - only to be greeted by the smell of      stale cooking oil. That afternoon my herbs were moved to a      cupboard away from the kitchen.    </p>    <p>      It also goes without saying that dried herbs should never      be stored within reach of young children. Remember: They      are potential medicines.    </p>    <p>      Your choice of container is equally important. Some types      are totally unsuitable for the storage of dried herbs.      Metal containers tend to impart a bitter, metallic flavor      and odor to the plants and should never be used. Likewise,      clear glass jars allow sunlight to filter through, and      prolonged exposure to sunlight will inevitably lead to a      loss of potency. Wooden containers can be used      occasionally, but these are also prone to absorbing      moisture.    </p>    <p>      Suitable containers can be ceramic, earthenware, brown      glass, or plastic. Whichever type you use, make sure that      they are intact and airtight. (Some herbalists find that a      small amount of powdered chalk wrapped in tissue paper and      placed in the container aids against dampness.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Labeling:</strong> Failure to label jars correctly      has been the downfall of many a would-be herbalist, because      the consequences can, bluntly speaking, be fatal. Every      container should display a firmly secured label bearing the      following information:    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The Date:</strong></em> After several years of      storage, the potency of dried herbs may deteriorate      severely. Make sure that you know the date on which the      herbs were picked and dried. This will enable you to      determine when your stock needs renewing.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The Name:</strong></em> Always write the Latin,      botanical name of the herb on the label. Write the common      name also for quick reference, but remember that these      "nicknames" can be confusing.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The Method of Drying:</strong></em> As this      affects the potency of the herb, it is vital that you      contain this information on your label. A small sign such      as + may be used to denote those herbs which have been oven      dried, while a sign such as 0 can be used to identify frame      dried herbs.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The Part of the Herb:</strong></em> Always note      the part of the herb that you have stored. Comminuted      roots, bark, and leaves can all look much the same, and as      the various parts of a plant can have different medicinal      virtues, it is important to know which is which.    </p>    <h3>      Making Herbal Medicines</h3>      <p>      In the plant kingdom, every species is, when found within      its natural environment, in a perfect state of chemical      balance. Indeed, if this balance - this symbiotic      relationship with the external environment - did not      exist, the plant could not survive. Unfortunately, this      chemical balance is extremely delicate, and if the natural      constituency of the plant is disturbed in any way that      balance is destroyed.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the difficulty lies in administering a medicinal      herb without destroying that precious balance. Defoliation,      drying, heating, exposure to sunlight over a prolonged      period after picking, and a host of other processes      normally initiate the very thing that should be avoided at      all costs - namely, a loss of potency. Logic tells us      then that if a change in the plant's physiology or      environment causes a loss of potency, the administration of      the herb in its natural state (i.e. raw) must likewise      ensure a maximum potency. It is for this reason that herbs      should, technically speaking, be eaten raw in the same      manner as a vegetable.    </p>    <p>      Consequently, it becomes obvious that the desired method of      ingesting herbal material is also the least practicable.      For this reason, herbalists over the centuries have      developed alternative ways of giving medicines to patients,      and no one can effectively use herbs for medicinal purposes      without these methods.    </p>    <h3>      Extractions</h3>     <p>      Simply speaking, an extraction is any herbal medicine that      has as its basis the extracted fluid or properties of a      plant, but does not contain particles of the actual plant      material itself. There are five major methods of producing      extractions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Infusions:</strong> Sometimes called tisanes,      infusions are the quickest way of producing herbal      medicines. To make a good infusion you will need:    </p>    <p>      1) A small pan. 2) A measuring jug, preferably glass. 3) A      set of household scales. 4) A tea strainer. 5) One ounce of      dried herb for every pint of medicine that you require    </p>    <p>      <strong>Equipment</strong> : The pan should be enamel (or      iron). Never use copper or aluminum pans as they impart a      bitter flavor to the herb, and small particles of these      metals have been known to find their way into the human      digestive system. A good measuring jug is a necessity. It      should be constructed of heat-proof glass, but if this is      not available, a good-quality "plus" polymer.    </p>    <p>      An accurate set of scales is necessary for measuring out      quantities of the dried herb. (Always check that your      scales are properly adjusted before you begin.)    </p>    <p>      The strainer serves a dual purpose. Not only does it carry      out the obvious task of removing plant particles from the      infusion, but it can also be used to increase the strength      of the medicine.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Method</strong> : Pour one pint of cold water into      a pan. Heat the water to boiling point, switch off the heat      and wait for 30 seconds. Then sprinkle the herb into the      water and stir. Never pour boiling water over the dried      herb or add the herb directly to water that is still      boiling, as this destroys the potency. Leave the plant      material in the water for 10 minutes, giving the occasional      stir. Pour the liquid through the strainer into the      container. If a stronger tisane is required, re-pour the      liquid through the plant particles in the strainer two or      three times.    </p>    <p>      (Those who find the bitter taste of some infusions      disagreeable can sweeten them with honey or brown sugar.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Decoctions:</strong> The art of preparing a good      decoction takes minutes to learn and years to master. Made      correctly, they are potent medicines that need to be taken      only in relatively small amounts. Made incorrectly, they      are nothing short of useless.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Method:</strong> Take one ounce of the dried herb      and place in a pan. Add one pint of cold water and bring to      a boil. Turn down the heat and allow the liquid to simmer      down to 1/4 of its original volume. The decoction should      then be strained.    </p>    <p>      Decoctions are particularly valuable when making medicines      from roots or bark, as their active principles cannot      normally be drawn out in sufficient quantities simply by      making an infusion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tinctures:</strong> (Sometimes called macerations.)      Alcohol is much more effective than water for drawing out      the medicinal properties of plants. Because of this, many      herbalists soak fresh or dried herbs in alcohol for      prolonged periods. The resultant mixture is an extremely      potent medicine that need only be administered in small      amounts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Method:</strong> There are various methods used in      the manufacture of tinctures, but the simplest way is to      soak one ounce of the herb in one pint of alcohol for a      period of eight weeks. The container should be shaken daily      for the first four weeks.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAUTION:</strong> <em>Never use wood alcohol or      methanol as this can be a deadly poison.</em>    </p>    <h3>      A WORD OF CAUTION</h3>      <p>      One of the greatest advantages of herbal medicine as a      therapy is that it is - when administered correctly      - completely safe. Unfortunately, some amateur      herbalists have, in their sincere desire to publicize the      beneficial qualities of plant medicines, fostered the      totally erroneous idea that herbal medicines can be      swallowed in a spirit of cavalier abandon without causing      the slightest harm. This notion is both incorrect and      dangerous.    </p>    <p>      Despite the fact that herbal preparations are far safer in      general than orthodox medicines, they must still be used      with discrimination. Some plants are extremely toxic and      can cause serious poisoning or even death.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The golden rules of herbalism</strong>    </p>    <p>      1. Unless you are medically qualified to do so, never treat      anything but minor ailments at home. Always seek      professional advice for serious conditions.    </p>    <p>      2. Even minor ailments that fail to respond to home      treatment should be given the benefit of expert advice.    </p>    <p>      3. Always check the dosage of a homemade herbal preparation      before you take it. Only take large doses under medical      supervision.    </p>    <p>      4. Never use any herb for medicinal purposes unless you      have identified it correctly and are sure it is safe.    </p>    <p>      5. Finally, remember this golden rule of self-medication:      If in doubt, don't!    </p>
