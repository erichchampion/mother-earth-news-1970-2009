        			<h3>     SUNDAY AFTERNOON    </h3>         <h5 id="byline">      by Jim Deacove    </h5>      <p>      Whenever we go to the city and have a picnic in a park, our children head      straight for the sets of metal climbing bars. This year,      for a birthday surprise, I priced a basic set of bars made      by a local welder. He told me that it would cost over $100,      and that a particularly good set would run me well over      $200. If you add to this the cost of transporting one of      those heavy things from town to our farm, you can      understand why metal climbing bars were way out of our      price range.    </p>    <p>      Then, one afternoon, while pruning the orchard and having      to remove two large limbs that broke off an old crab-apple      tree, I thought of making my own climbing set. The children      definitely needed something to exercise their muscles on,      and what would be more natural than a climbing set made out      of trees? Most of the trees that were still alive and      growing were too large for the children, but if I could put      together portions of smaller trees, it might be just right.      It was.    </p>        <p>      I sawed the largest limb into two pieces. I was then able      to hitch a chain to all the big pieces and pull them easily      with our half-ton truck. I sawed off the weak and broken      branches, making sure there were no jagged edges. Then I      tried different combinations of intertwining limbs and      branches until I was satisfied that the whole thing was      stable, pleasing to the eye, and offered an adventure in      climbing.    </p>    <p>      You need to work with at least three pieces -      connecting the mostly large branches works best. I just      nailed the whole thing together. (I was going to bolt it      all, but I found that a few well-laced 3" common nails were      just as good.)    </p>    <p>      Visitors first think we have a wood sculpture in the yard;      then they see the children climbing all over it!    </p>
