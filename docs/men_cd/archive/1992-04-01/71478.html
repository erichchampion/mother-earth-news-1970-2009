                <p>      <strong>LAST LAUGH</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>No Deficit At Home</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Patricia Penton Leimbach    </h5>        <p>      "Hey make up a list of what you earned last year," hollers      my husband from the next room, where he's wind ing up his      six weeks' dalliance with income tax forms. Well, let's      see. What did I earn last year? A skilled homemaker should      be worth at least $3 an hour, and she invests about 12      hours a day. Of course, I wasn't here every day and Sundays      were light. Say 300 days at $36 a day. That's $10,800 to      start with. And then a farmer's wife has "hired man" tasks      to lengthen most of her days. I went to work with my      thinker and my eigth-grade math and I drew up my list.    </p>		    <p>      I laid it on the bookkeeper's desk and left. In a      calculated few moments, there was a roar. "That's not what      I wanted!"    </p>    <p>      "But you asked me what I earned. I thought my estimate was      conservative, considering my education and experience."    </p>    <p>      "Would you please make me up a list of what you actually      got," he said in exasperation.    </p>    <p>      "Ohhh...what I actually got ...Well, that's something      else..."    </p>    <p>      Much later I slipped in and laid my second list on his      desk:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Payment Received for Services      Rendered:</strong><br />      <br />      Sunrise over the valley about 300 times (No failure with      the sun. I was absent a few times)<br />      <br />      Sunset over Scmaltz's barn<br />      <br />      A picture frame of barn siding<br />      <br />      Picnics in the pasture<br />      <br />      Two dogs working a woodchuck hole<br />      <br />      Rain coming across the potatoes in August<br />      <br />      New peas on counter, June 10<br />      <br />      Sweet corn on counter, July 10<br />      <br />      New potatoes on counter, August 10<br />      <br />      A banana cream pie (from scratch) from a son on Sunday      morning<br />      <br />      Swamp buttercups in May<br />      <br />      Rural free delivery<br />      <br />      An oriole in the pear tree<br />      <br />      Hot buttered rum by a hearthfire in a blizzard<br />      <br />      A wrought-iron kettle restored by a son<br />      <br />      Lunch alone with my honey on weekdays<br />      <br />      Sons coming into supper from working with their      father<br />      <br />      A golden ginkgo tree in October<br />      <br />      Little kids in leaf piles<br />      <br />      Impromptu visits with neighbors<br />      <br />      A chipmunk on the back steps<br />      <br />      One perfect coal bin full of wood, coal and a neat stack of      kindling (Beautiful!!)<br />      <br />      Walking down the road on a starry night<br />      <br />      Bare branches against the moon on a winter sky<br />      <br />      Wheat emerging under snow<br />      <br />      More love, support, concrete assistance, and encouragement      than I deserve<br />      <br />      <strong>Total value: Incalculable</strong><br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      And to it I affixed the following note:    </p>    <p>      I found it impossible to assign a value to these things,      and I suppose it's just as well. If the IRS figures a way      to tax our real wealth, we'll be bankrupt. No matter how      you slice it, "Payment Received" exceeds "Amount Earned."    </p>
