        <p class="caption">(6) Shaving upward on left side. Note position of hands, handle. Shave like this to the sideburn and NEVER move blade along its length. (7) Shaving downward on left side with jaw stretched tight and fingers out of the way. (8) Shave right side upward first, then (9) downward just like you shaved left side. Be careful around the mustache, it took a while to grow. The stroke used on the chin is like this one, parallel to the jaw bone. (10) Trim under mustache by holding it up away from the blade and shaving up to it. Again, keep skin as tight as possible. (11) The underside of the chin is done by stretching the head back to tighten the skin and shaving upward against the grain. Finish by sticking out jaw to hold skin and shaving upward under lower lip.</p>
