BOX      2874, BOULDER, COLORADO 80302    </p>         <h3>PART FOUR: HOMEMADE WHEEL DELIVERS OVER 3 HP.</h3>    <p>      Though one of man's oldest prime movers, a water wheel is      still a fascinating piece of machinery. Perhaps this is      because it appears comprehensible at a glance (although an      efficient wheel is actually a product of subtle and      inconspicuous design refinements), and because it seems to      be a way of getting power for nothing. The homemade wheel      described here was especially designed for this series on      harnessing small streams (see MOTHER NO. 13, pages 23-33),      and will reward a careful craftsman by delivering years of      constant service. It's particularly suited for an      installation having a moderate head (25' to 60') and      relatively small flow (.45 to .75 cubic feet per second).      Subsequent installments will describe the con struction of      wheels suited for lesser heads of water and other varied      conditions.    </p>        <p>      As is apparent from the drawings, this is an impulse wheel,      driven by the impulses produced as water strikes revolving      blades or buckets. In a perfectly designed wheel, the water      strikes at high speed, exhausts its energy in driving the      wheel to which the bucket is attached, and then falls free      of the wheel.    </p>    <p>      Known as a Pelton wheel, this type developed from the      "hurdy gurdy", a paddle wheel used in California by the      forty-niners. The hurdy-gurdy was a wheel that rotated in a      vertical plane, had flat vanes fixed around its      circumference, and was driven by the force of water      striking the vanes. It was not an efficient machine, but it      was simple to construct. Then an engineer named Lester      Pelton substituted a cup-shaped, divided bucket for each of      the vanes, and by that step added a high degree of      efficiency to the wheel's other virtues.    </p>    <p>      No single wheel will meet all operating requirements, but      some will perform under a reasonably wide range of      conditions. The following table indicates the r.p.m. and      horsepower output that will be delivered by this wheel      under given conditions of head and flow. The latter is      measured in cubic feet per second:<br />    </p>        <p>      Thus, if a survey of your stream indicates a head and flow      close to these values, this Pelton wheel will fit neatly      into your plans.    </p>        <p>      Strictly speaking a water wheel is an engine powered by      water, just as an automobile engine is powered by gasoline.      The important power-producing elements of the wheel are the      buckets and the nozzle, and considerable care should be      exercised to see that these parts are made correctly. The      nozzle meters the correct amount of water to the wheel, and      forms and directs the jet against the buckets. Both the      inside diameter and the location of the nozzle with respect      to the wheel are very important, since the jet must impinge      upon each bucket at the correct wheel radius or lever arm.      It must also be divided equally by the center ridge of each      bucket.    </p>    <p>      The function of the bucket is to convert the energy of the      jet, represented by its high speed, into mechanical energy      at the wheel shaft. To do this it must slow the water from      its high speed in the jet to practically zero speed when it      drops into the tail water. Maximum efficiency with this      wheel will be obtained if the buckets have the form and      size shown in the drawing. This shape acts to slow the jet      by turning it smoothly through 180 deg. The surface of each      bucket must be as smooth as possible. A mirror finish is      desirable on the inside, and even the back of each bucket      should be ground and polished to minimize spray.    </p>    <p>      Important also is the correct orientation of the bucket to      the jet. When the full jet strikes, the bucket should be      perpendicular to it. Both the nozzle and the buckets will      wear under the action of the high-speed water, at a rate      determined by the silt content and should therefore be made      easily removable for replacement.<br />    </p>    <p>      Above all, buckets must be uniform. If you can get access      to a metal-cutting handsaw, cut the blanks according to a      single pattern. This pattern can be shaped so as to form      the end bevels automatically when the blanks are bent, and      the bending itself can be done in a jig or hammering form.      This jig may be made of a piece of pipe of about 2" outside      diameter mounted in hardwood endplates. Also provide a      holding fixture that will slide in the table groove of the      handsaw to assure that the slots for the end lugs are cut      and spaced uniformly. A holding jig should also be made to      line up the lugs and buckets for welding. On completion,      balance the wheel by laying weld beads along the backs of      any light buckets. Beads should be laid carefully and      ground smooth.    </p>    <p>      Ball bearings may be employed, but are not necessary since      the wheel turns at comparatively low speeds. If the builder      prefers to use plain bearings, it will simplify machining      the shaft, which should present a shoulder to the inside of      the bearing so that the wheel may be positioned. If plain      bearings are employed, babbitted linings are satisfactory,      provided provision is made for proper lubrication.    </p>    <p>      One vital job that the foundation must do is hold the wheel      and the nozzle in correct relative positions. It should be      placed on firm ground or piling so that it will not settle      unevenly, and must, of course, take advantage of all the      head possible. The penstock from the dam should have easy      access to the nozzle, and the tail water easy escape to the      stream. If possible use 4" or larger pipe for the penstock      and lay it out to hold frictional losses to a minimum. The      width of the foundation is such as to allow the water to      fly clear of the buckets. The removable cover over the      upper half of the wheel may fit more closely, since no      water sprays from the buckets through this half of the      revolution.    </p>            <p>      The foundation may be made of such materials as timbers in      a framework, masonry, or concrete, so long as it fulfills      the above requirements. The wheel and the machinery being      driven may then be housed in any suitable, inexpensive      shed.<br />    </p>    <p>      It's not wise to dispense with a gate valve, which is used      to cut off or to throttle the water supply to the wheel.      Since a gate valve cannot be operated rapidly, it is the      best type, eliminating the risk of dangerous water hammer      in the penstock. It is also well suited for throttling      because fine adjustment is obtainable through the long      operating screw. In throttling, the gate valve should be      used together with a tachometer or revolution counter      connected to the wheel shaft to secure the optimum speed      and horsepower for the stream condition and load. Either      fasten a tachometer permanently to the shaft, or keep a      revolution counter handy in the wheel shed.    </p>    <p>      Generally the head and volume of water flowing to the wheel      will remain constant, resulting in a constant output. If      the machinery driven by the wheel has a level power demand      there will be little need for constant adjustment of the      valve.    </p>    <p>      The requisite piping, pipe fittings, steel sheet and rod      bolts and nuts, and gaskets are available at      building-supply houses houses or steel distributors.      Machine screws, lock nuts bearings, and the like may be      purchased from good-sized hardware distrib utors or      mail-order houses.    </p>    <p>      One final point to keep in mind in making your      calculations: head is defined as the vertical distance      between the water surface behind the dam and the tail-water      surface at the wheel. For an impulse wheel, however, which      cannot operate submerged, the available head is measured      from headwater to the center line of the nozzle. As shown      in the construction drawing, there is only 5" difference      between the two definitions, but this can make some      difference in output when working with the moderate heads      for which this wheel is designed.<br />      While many details can be altered, the reader should beware      of any that will affect operating characteristics. Thus      stainless steel buckets and antifriction bearings would      improve performance, involving only some extra work in      building the wheel. Changes in the nozzle diameter, wheel      radius, or effective head, however, should be undertaken      only after careful consideration of the probable effect on      performance.    </p>    <h3>PARTFIVE: BUILDING All OVERSHOT      WHEEL</h3>    <p>      Often seen beside a picturesque rural mill, an overshot      water wheel possesses two excellent      characteristics-considerable mechanical efficiency      and easy maintenance. Many have remained in service for      decades, and now lend a nostalgic charm to their      surroundings.    </p>    <p>      Operated by gravity, the overshot wheel derives its name      from the manner in which water enters the buckets set      around its periphery. Pouring from a flume above the wheel,      the water shoots into buckets on the down-moving side,      overbalancing the empty ones opposite and keeping the wheel      in slow rotation.    </p>    <p>      Since such a wheel may be located near but not actually in      the stream, it offers endless landscaping possibilities for      a country home where a stream with sufficient flow is      available. If a site on dry ground is chosen, the      foundation may be constructed dry and the water led to the      wheel and a tailrace excavated. With very little effort,      the scene may be turned into an attractive garden spot, the      wheel becoming both a landscaping feature and a source of      power.    </p>    <p>      It should be noted, however, that an overshot wheel is      practical only for a small-capacity output. How much power      it will produce depends upon the weight of water the      buckets hold and its radius, or lever arm. Expressed in      another way, the output depends upon the weight of water      transported and the height, or head, through which it falls      while in the buckets. For maximum efficiency, the wheel      must use the weight of the water through as much of the      head as possible. Therefore, the buckets should not spill      or sling water until very near tail water.    </p>        <p>      <em>Power Increases with Width</em><br />    </p>    <p>      Although of simple construction, an overshot wheel is      cumbersome in size. For this reason, before attempting to      build one be certain you have the facilities to move and      lift it into place when completed. Also allow yourself      plenty of working floor space. It must be understood, too,      that such a wheel is a sizeable project and requires a lot      of material and time. Extreme care in cutting and      assembling the parts is not essential, however, because the      wheel, operating at slow speed, need not be accurately      balanced.    </p>    <p>      Accompanying this article are drawings that illustrate the      construction of a small wheel suitable for a water head of      6' 3". The wheel itself has a diameter of 5', leaving a      flume head of 15" to propel the water into the buckets. As      shown in the table at the bottom of page 31, you may build      the wheel to give a power output ranging from 1/2 hp. to 1      hp. at 10 r.p.m. All dimensions remain the same except the      width, the horsepower increasing as this is increased. For      1/2 hp., the wheel should be 15-31/32" wide. For 1 hp., it      should be 31-29/32". Before deciding on the wheel size,      you'll want to make a survey of the power available in the      stream (PSM, April and May '47).    </p>    <p>      Virtually all large wheels are built with wood or steel      arms, as in the drawing below, and have a shroud plate only      around the outer edge, but you may find it simpler and more      satisfactory to build the drum-type wheel described here.      In this case, each shroud plate is a disk of 1/8" sheet      steel. Each disk is braced by a 1/8" sheet steel sole plate      to which it is continuously welded, by the buckets, by one      of the two large diameter 1/4" steel hub flanges to which      it also is continuously welded, and by the long hub itself.    </p>        <p>      <em>Large Sheet Required</em><br />    </p>    <p>      If preferred, the shroud plates may be made of wood. If so,      care should be taken to bolt them securely to the hub      flanges. Bushings pressed into the wood for the bolts will      give the wheel a longer life expectancy.<br />      Sheet steel for the disks may be ordered direct from      several large steel companies in case your local supply      house is unable to furnish it. Ordinarily, such steel comes      in standard 48" widths, so you may have to weld together      two or more sheets to get the required 5' diameter, using      either a butt weld or a backing plate. This will produce      some distortion or ripple, as will the welding on of the      numerous clips required. So long as distortion is local,      however, and the main lines of wheel and shaft remain true,      this will do no harm.    </p>    <p>      After the sheet has been prepared, scribe a 5' circle on it      and cut it with the cutting flame of a gas welding torch.      With ordinary care, this method should give sufficient      accuracy. Vent and drainage holes should be drilled as      indicated around each disk to lessen corrosion with the      drum.<br />      <em>Good Buckets Important</em>The buckets are the most      important element of the wheel. To give maximum efficiency,      they must be formed so that the water enters smoothly at      the top of their travel and remains in them until just      before they reach the bottom. For this reason, the bucket      form indicated on the facing page should be followed      faithfully. Either sheet metal or wood is an acceptable      material, but metal is better suited to cold climates,      since wood is damaged when absorbed water freezes. Because      the buckets are subject to wear from the water and sediment      that it carries along, you may want to install them so they      can be easily replaced.    </p>    <p>      In laying out and making wooden buckets, follow these      steps:    </p>    <p>      Using a common center, strike off two arcs, one with a      21-1/2" radius and the other with a 2' 6" radius. Then draw      a radius line intersecting these arcs.    </p>    <p>      From the point where the radius crosses the inner arc,      measure 2-3/4" farther along the line and mark the point      <em>E</em> .    </p>    <p>      From the point where the radius crosses the outer arc, draw      a chord 10-1/2" long and from the new point where this      intersects the outer arc draw a line to point <em>E</em> .      You now have the inner trace of the bucket.    </p>    <p>      Take a piece of the bucket stock and lay it along the upper      edge of this inner trace, and you have a cross section      through the bucked, Cut your stock accordingly, making the      length equal to <em>B</em> in the table of      dimensions.<em>Steel Buckets Require Jig</em>    </p>    <p>      Steel buckets are only slightly more difficult if you      follow these steps:    </p>    <p>      Using a common center, strike off two arcs on a piece of      plywood, one with a 21-1/2" radius and the other with a 2'      6" radius.    </p>    <p>      Draw a radius line and then a tangent to the inner arc,      making it vertical to the radius. From the point of      tangency, measure 5" along the tangent. Mark this point.    </p>    <p>      Using this mark as a center, strike off an arc with a 5"      radius. This is part of the inner trace of the bucket.    </p>    <p>      At the point where the original radius line (Step 2)      crosses the outer arc, draw a chord 10-1/2" long, and at      point <em>F</em> where this chord intersects the outer arc      draw a new radius line. Also at point <em>F</em> measure      off 15 deg. below the new radius and draw line <em>FG</em>      11-1/2" long.    </p>    <p>      Then, using <em>G</em> as a center, strike an arc with a      11-1/2" radius. This forms the rest of the inner trace of      the bucket.    </p>    <p>      Cut the plywood along this line and along the lines that      form a quarter ellipse. Using this as a pattern, cut      several more quarter ellipses from scrap. Nail these to      stretchers to make a bending jig around which the buckets      may be formed.<br />      <em>Weld Wheel Parts</em><br />      Welding of the various parts of the wheel produces an      exceptionally strong construction. After getting together      or making all the required parts, begin the assembly by      welding four clips to each end of the hub sleeve. Then weld      the required number of clips to the shroud plates for the      sole plate, and weld the shroud plates to the clips on the      hub sleeve. After welding both hub flanges to the shroud      plates and the sleeve with a continuous weld, attach the      sole plate to the clips on the shroud plates with No. 8      self-tapping screws. Also weld the sole plate to the shroud      plates with a continuous weld, and the bucket-support      angles to the sole plate.    </p>    <p>      Attach wooden buckets to the supports with 3/4" No. 10      roundhead wood screws, and then drill holes 2" from center      to center through the shroud plates for 1-3/4" No. 10      roundhead wood screws. If you use steel buckets, rivet or      screw 10 clips to each side of each bucket and attach the      buckets to the angles with No. 8 self-tapping screws. Then      drill holes through the shroud plates in the way of the      clips for the same type of screws.<br />      <em>Lubricate Bearings Well</em><br />      Using locknuts and washers, fasten the hub sleeve to the      shaft with two 3/8" by 4-1/2" bolts, placed at right angles      to each other. Two bearing mountings having 2-3/8"      renewable liners with shoulders should be bolted to the      foundation. Place shims about 1/4"thick under the bearings.    </p>    <p>      Standard bearing mountings, variously called pedestals or      blocks, may be bought complete with wick oiler or cup oil      reservoir and with built-in self-aligning features.      Standard bronze bearing metal liners or inserts likewise      may be bought from any machine component supplier. Babbitt      liners are equally satisfactory.    </p>    <p>      Although the wheel turns slowly, it is heavy and will be      running almost constantly, so good lubrication of the      bearings is essential. To this end, care should be taken to      insure that the bearing liners are finished to the correct      fit. Porous inserts or inserts containing graphite are      excellent for this application, but may cost more than      regular bearing inserts.    </p>    <p>      It is important that the foundation be carried deep enough      so that water falling from the buckets will not undermine      it. Avoid a long flume if possible, in order to keep the      construction as simple as possible. Strengthen it along its      entire length with an exterior frame and support it well      from dam to wheel with pipe uprights.<em>Sluice Governs      Wheel</em>    </p>    <p>      The sluice gate may be located at any convenient place      along the flume. Since it is the governing mechanism of the      wheel, its installation should be anything but slipshod. If      it is installed at an angle as on the following page, water      pressure will keep it at any desired position. If installed      vertically, some mechanism, such as a rack and pinion,      should be provided to keep it in place.    </p>    <p>      Adjust the sluice so that the buckets will run one-quarter      full. This will give a wheel speed of 10 r.p.m. If the      buckets are allowed to run more than one-quarter full, the      efficiency of the wheel will drop for two reasons. Because      of the increased speed, centrifugal force will throw water      from the buckets. They also will begin to spill before      approaching tail water. Although this practice does waste      water, it may be profitably employed during a freshet to      increase the power output, for at such times the excess      water would be wasted anyway.    </p>
