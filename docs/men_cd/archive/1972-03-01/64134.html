                    <p>      If the small family farm is se great that thousands upon      thousands of us want to "get back" to one these days . . .      how come the families who were already on those farms left      their 40 and 80-acre spreads in the first place? Well, the      truth be known, most of those families didn't leave the      land because they wanted to. They were forced off      and-most especially since the end of World War      Two-they've been forced off by a big business-bio      labor-big politics monster known as "agribusiness".    </p>    <p>      Now, agribusiness means a lot of things to a lot of people      but-to the down-home farm family-it has mostly      meant a combination of spiraling costs for the fertilizers.      hybrid seeds, pesticides, inoculations, barns. silos and      ever-bigger row-crop machines they were told they needed to      buy to "be competitive" . . . and plunging prices for those      row-crop harvests they sold as they and their neighbors      did, indeed, become more and more competitive.    </p>    <p>      Thanks to that squeeze, millions of small farmers-the      traditional "backbone of the nation"-have been and      are still being forced to sell out, move to the cities and      try to fit into an alienating world of increasing      congestion, mounting pollution, rising crime and plastic      distractions that they never wanted any part of. And the      big insurance companies, banks, investment organizations      and corporations continue to transform the countryside into      instant suburbs and the kind of factory farms that spew out      the fertilized, sprayed, treated, enhanced, fortified,      processed, enriched, homogenized and preserved foods that      our advertising and marketing establish tells us we love so      dearly. It's a tragic waste of good land and good lives.    </p>    <p>      Sooner or later someone, somewhere, just naturally had to      take a stand against such insane "progress" . . . and that      someone was Earl Shell of Coffeyville, Kansas.      Shell-an expert horticulturalist who once earned a      substantial living as a garden farmer near Topeka,      Kansas-has long known that "you can make more money      with an acre of strawberries than you call with 100 acres      of wheat". It seemed strange to him, then, to watch one      little farmer after another "starve to death oil a tractor"      trying to play the agribusiness game when Earl knew that      those same little farmers could "prosper with a hoe".    </p>    <p>      The irony of the situation particularly galled Shell when      he looked around the nine-county area where he lived in      southeast Kansas' Ozarks region. By the mid-60's that area      was already run down anf spotted with the empty and      deserted houses of what had once been reasonably prosperous      small family homesteads. In 1967, the average farm income      of that section of Kansas was estimated at less than $3,400      and it was obvious that just all extra $1,000 annually      could well make the difference between success and failure      the families that were still trying to hold on. Earl Shell      decided that he'd just dang well help each one of those      families earn that $1,000 ... and maybe an extra $3,000 or      $4,000 to boot!    </p>    <p>      Early in 1968, Earl joined prominent men in the Coffeyville      area and began organizing Farm Products Management, a non-      profit growing and marketing co-op designed to tackle the      problems of southeast Kansas' little farmers with what Earl      and his backers called the "Eight Acre Plan".    </p>    <p>      The Eight Acre Plan is not based on dreamy illusions.      Rather, it's a hard-nosed, practical program designed to      raise-by $3,000 to $5,000 a year-the net income      of any farm family who will plant one acre of strawberries,      two acres of blackberries and raspberries and five acres of      apples or peaches.    </p>    <p>      "The Eight Acre Plan is tailored for our section of the      country," Shell says, "but it should work almost anywhere      with only minor modifications. We recommend an acre of      strawberries because the fruit grows well in the Ozarks      area, its fresh market demand is unlimited and the net      yield per acre on this berry is higher than for any other      fruit or vegetable we know. The varieties we      recommend-Surecrop and Rled Star -produce 5,000      to 12,000 quarts per acre and the grower usually receives      30 cents a quart wholesale strawberries. Figuring      conservatively, a family that follows our directions should      net at least $1,200 a year on this acre.    </p>    <p>      "Red and black raspberries and blackberries wholesale for      double the price of strawberries and demand for them is      also good but their net return per acre is not nearly as      high. Still, such berries will quite easily return their      grower $500 per acre and the average should be a good deal      higher than that. At even the low figure. though, that's      another $1,000 a year for the farms that follow our plan.    </p>    <p>      "The semi-dwarf apple and peach trees planted on the      remaining five acres of the Eight Acre Plan will bear on      the fifth year and, after amortization of all costs, should      net a bare minimum of $1,500 a year from the fifth year on.      Actually, the average should be in the neighborhood of      $3,500 to $5,000 annually and-don't forget-that      orchard automatically increases the value of the land it's      on by $200 to $1,000 an acre."    </p>    <p>      Although Earl Shell knew that his figures were correct, the      debt-ridden farmers he first talked to four years ago      didn't. They were skeptical, "Well, that's an interesting      notion" they'd generally say, "but I believe I'll stick to      my wheat. I never heard of anybody making money with      strawberries around here."    </p>    <p>      "No," Shell would answer, "you haven't . . . because the      people in this area who've tried it in the past have always      attempted to market their produce through roadside stands      or one or two independent grocers. But we're going to      organize to co-op, hire the best marketing specialist we      can find and sell our berries and fruit by the truckload.      Matter of fact, once we're rolling, we'll probably be able      to guarantee you a market for everything you raise before      you even set out a crop."    </p>    <p>      Shell's arguments and promises only brought 21 growers into      FPM's program during the first two years . . . but those 21      soon found that Earl's ideas worked! By late 1970 FPM's      original farmers were happily tallying up thousands of      extra dollars and enthusiastically spreading the word about      the Eight Acre Plan. One-Donald Duff, who'd been      slowly going, under trying to raise cows and soybeans on      640 acres near Thayer. Kansas-said, "For us., it's      the difference between sticking with the farm or giving up.      Now that I know FPM really works, I'm getting in deep.      We've planted 1,500 apple trees and three acres of      berries."    </p>    <p>      The association currently has a membership of 120 and Shell      expects to count over 250 participants in the program by      the end of 1972, "There's a tremendous enthusiasm for the      idea now," he reports. "Most of our people are between 40      and 50 but we're signing up new growers all the way from      retired folks right down to teenagers. Those youngsters are      the ones that really make are happy. We'd like to help them      stay on the farms and there's only one way to do that . . .      see to it that they can make as much money farming as at      anything else. We think we can do it."    </p>    <p>      Right now, FPM is furthering that dream by concentrating on      breaking into the apple market ("We'll change the entire      economic picture down here!"). The association's members      have already, planted 15,000 semi-dwarf trees and will set      out another 25,000 this year. The first harvest from these      quick-developing orchards will come in 1974.    </p>    <p>      By that time, FPM plans to have a network      climate-controlled warehouses in operation. Everyday's      picking of fruit will be driven to the nearest warehouse      each night where experienced fruit handlers will grade,      package and label the apples before loading them into      refrigerated trucks to be shipped to their wholesale      destination. Moving the produce from field or orchard to      the food distributor's warehouse should take no more than      36 hours.    </p>    <p>      Farm Products Management will require financial muscle to      accomplish all of this-and the association's      revolving capital investment fund, into which grower is      expected to put $200-just won't be enough. Ultimately      large loans will be necessary and some help may be      forthcoming from FPM's affiliation with the Ozarks Regional      Commission, a joint federal-state effort to improve the      economic situation in Missouri, in Kansas, Oklahoma and      Arkansas.    </p>    <p>      Earl doesn't regard such government assistsance as charity.      "This is no handout" he declares. "We don't want that. But      there's no getting around the fact that at the point where      we'll have to start buying expensive refrigeration      equipment, we're going to need help. That money isn't a      giveaway . . . it's an investment in the future of this      area.    </p>    <p>      "Farm Products Management, remember, is a non-profit      corporation. Everyone connected with us has to be      dedicated. There isn't a person on the staff who couldn't      be earning more money somewhere else. We're here because we      believe this thing, is going to work . . . and it will!      We're on the way now.    </p>    <p>      "I hope that in 10 years we'll have 10,000 members in this      area alone. By that time, similar groups all over the      country will be following our lead. This can be a terrific      force in our nation,"    </p>    <p>      It certainly can . . . and a force that is long overdue.      Think of it: hundreds of regional growers' associations...      a revival of the old cooperative spirit among small      landholders . . . fresher and more nutritious food for      everyone... bankruptcy for corporate agribusiness . . . and      a reversal of the country-to-city migration. The potential      is mindboggling!    </p>    <p>      Watch MOTHER'S future issues for more news about Earl      Shell, FPM and the Eight Acre Plan.    </p>
