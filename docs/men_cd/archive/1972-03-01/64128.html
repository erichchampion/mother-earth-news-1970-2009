                    <h5 id="byline">by BARBARA THIEL</h5>        <p>      There <em>is</em> an alternative to the sugared,      chemicalized, flavor-enhanced yogurt found in the      supermarket. You can grow your own culture at home -      at a fraction of the cost - in a simple, never-fail      incubator made from two metal cans, an electric cord, a      75-watt bulb and a thermometer!    </p>    <p>      First find two good-sized cans of approximately the same      diameter (three-pound coffee cans work well). Also get an      electric cord with a light socket on one end and a plug on      the other.    </p>    <p>      Now, in the bottom of one of the cans (the smaller one, if      they aren't the same size), punch a hole just large enough      to allow you to thread in the plug of the cord. Pull the      plug all the way through the hole and leave the socket      inside the can. Screw a regular 75-watt bulb (I don't think      the Soft-White type will work as well) into the socket. Put      the other can - bottom down - on top of the      first . . . and you're ready to go. Now for the yogurt.    </p>    <p>      Find a large <em>clean</em> glass jar that will fit      comfortably - with space around its sides -      into the top can. Fill the jar with warm milk (not too hot      . . . 100°-120° Fahrenheit). If you're using      reconstituted (non-instant) powdered milk, add a large can      of evaporated milk to the full jar. Now mix in 2 to 4      heaping tablespoons of the tastiest yogurt you can find      (natural flavor is best but the fruits work too). The more      you use the faster the batch will congeal.    </p>    <p>      Fill the top can of your incubator about half full with      water warm enough to register between 110° and 120°      F. on the thermometer. Set the jar in the can and check to      make sure the water comes up at least even with the yogurt      inside the glass container. In other words, all the yogurt      should be below the level of the warm water outside. Now      cover the top of the jar with a clean cloth, plug in the      cord and put your incubator where it won't be disturbed for      about four hours.    </p>    <p>      The 75-watt bulb should keep the temperature of the water      fairly constant. Anywhere between 100° and 120° F.      is OK, but - just to make sure check the water with      the thermometer every once in a while the first time you      make yogurt.    </p>    <p>      If, for some reason, a 75-watt bulb doesn't maintain the      proper temperature . . . try one a little larger or      smaller, as necessary.    </p>    <p>      After four hours have passed, check the yogurt with a spoon      or by tilting the jar slightly. Gently, though, or the      culture might curdle. If the yogurt hasn't congealed, let      it incubate another half-hour or so and test again (ours      usually takes 4 1/2 hours). When the culture's consistency      is to your liking, put a cover on the jar and pop it into      the refrigerator. Additional incubation makes yogurt      increasingly sour, so incubate yours to taste and stop.      When the culture has cooled, it's all ready to eat.    </p>    <p>      Dig into the yogurt as is, with a little honey and fruit,      with prunes or . . . ? Don't forget to save a few spoonfuls      to start your <em>next</em> batch!    </p>
