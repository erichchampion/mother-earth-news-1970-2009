                    <p>      How can Tom Doyle ("More Plastic Mulch!" in MOTHER NO. 11)      improve the fertility and humus content of his sail year      after year if he leaves his plastic mulch in place for a 10      to 20 year period? Seems to me that he's taking away from      the soil without putting anything back . . . that's not      natural gardening, that's robbery!    </p>    <p>      Give me good ole rotten hay and the leaves from a nearby      town any day.    </p>    <p>      Sally Goldblatt<br />      Honeoye Falls, N. Y.    </p>    <p>      As a gardener, I have some serious reservations about black      plastic mulch, especially a permanent one (TMEN NO. 11). F.      P. Hughes talked about attempting to sterilize some ground      with plastic in order to make a nice lawn, and I'm afraid      it might be possible. Only I doubt that the mulch would      select out dandelions and plantain (eat them, no?). It's      possible you just might wipe out whole subterranean      micro-populations. Soil health depends heavily on all the      tiny beasties that live in it, and we don't know that those      near the surface are not harmed by being constantly in      total darkness with reduced air circulation. Light is      essential to many life processes; we can't just assume that      it's unimportant to soil life (there's a really good      article on light as "nutrient" in the July, 1971 issue of      PREVENTION magazine . . . worth digging up if only for the      questions it raises).    </p>    <p>      Plastic doesn't feed the soil, either, and it makes it hard      for the gardener to do so. Taking without returning equals      depletion (theft, rip-off) I would think, even if the first      years bring fantastic crops. The fact that this black      plastic "works" should by itself be no selling paint to      gardeners concerned about the long-term health of the soil.      Hard pesticides "work." So do chemical fertilizers.    </p>    <p>      I haven't used plastic sheeting in my own garden (I may, in      a little corner . . . but I'm certainly not ready to turn      my lone acre over to it). I'm skeptical about the material      lasting 10 or 20 years in usable size. We put clear six mil      plastic on the side of a drafty house once, and it was      shredded to smitherines the second year. Wind got into pin      holes and worked on it until the plastic was finished . . .      and it ain't cute hanging in the trees. More protected if      flat on the ground, granted, but 10 years . . . ? Seems      that one sharp-toed pooch on a spree could do enough damage      to make a strip of the stuff useless.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, when you finally go to discard the      plastic, it resists. It won't break down in cooperation      with nature, and burning it is a pretty poisonous prospect.    </p>    <p>      I hope we go easy with this new mulch, using it only in      times of special need (say drought, or for tomatoes in an      unusually cold season, etc.) till we're clearer about the      consequences of its wholesale adoption. How do earthworms      dig the environment that black plastic mulch produces?      What's the microbe count in similar soils before mulch,      after black plastic for one year and 10 years? Any      deficiency symptoms in plants after five years, 10 years?      How does nature react after the plastic is removed? Do      things quickly and naturally "green up" or is there a long      recovery period, lean ing the bare soil open to wind and      water erosion? Fish in pond are killed by raising water      temperatures a few degrees . . . how about the effects of      raising soil temperatures slightly over long periods of      time?    </p>    <p>      We need to know if we have here a good earth-loving tool,      just another paving material.    </p>    <p>      Judy Patton<br />      Emmett, Mich    </p>    <p>      I love MOTHER, but would like to take strong exception to      the articles on plastic mulch. Since plastic is absolutely      indestructible, the only excuse I can see for using it in      the garden is if you can get it from a source that was      otherwise going to throw it out. But buy it deliberately? .      . . a thousand times NO!    </p>    <p>      I've achieved excellent weed and Bermuda grass control with      several layers of magazines or newspapers, which cannot be      recycled through industry in my area. Layers of this      material allow moisture to penetrate and, after the first      few days, become packs down and won't tear or blow away.      Furthermore, newspapers decay after awhile and add      nutrients to the soil, which plastics don't (if you use      plastic, seems to me you'd have to plow in organic matter      ter at the end of the growing season). The papers can be      covered with grass clippings, leaves, wood chips, etc. to      make them sightly.    </p>    <p>      The only advantage of plastic over other types of mulch to      be in raising the temperature of the soil (but I wonder if      in a desert climate like mine, the plastic would heat up      the soil a plants TOO much and fry them to death). I've      never tried it, but I understand that the use of flat rocks      will produce the same insulating effect.    </p>    <p>      I don't think that we gardeners who like to call ourselves      c ganic should be buying such things as plastic to use in      our garden We should be setting an example for others to      follow.    </p>    <p>      Katherine Boswell<br />      Las Cruces, N.M.    </p>    <p>      About MOTHER NO. 11's articles on plastic mulch RETRACT,      RETRACT THEM.    </p>    <p>      I worked on a truck farm in Pennsylvania that used only      plastic mulch (six mil). True, it helps retard weed growth,      but it never, ever rots. And the business about 10 to 20      year use is pure crap. Plastic mulch only lasts a season,      unless you plant in the same slits the next year, and then      fertilizer has to be applied very ca: fully or it sits on      the plastic and runs off away from where the roots      are.<br />      <br />      At the end of the season, what with the dead pumpkin viand      a few frosts, it's impossible to pull the stuff up and      dispose it in one piece. It cracks, and bits of plastic      stay in the earth we ended up by burning it in the fall.    </p>    <p>      Laying the sheeting isn't easy either, even with the kind      of we used . . . a tractor-pulled plastic laying machine      that digs furrows and then fills them in. Problem was that      in any wind at all, the plastic wouldn't stay put.    </p>    <p>      As an alternative, I'd recommend straw or sawdust . . .      water can penetrate but weeds can't. If weeds do appear,      they can be pulled and left lying in the garden as added      mulch.    </p>    <p>      Paul Converse    </p>    <p>      Why did MOTHER have articles on plastic mulch in NO. 11?      Plastic is the most unnatural thing ever . . . it never      decomposes and it creates pollution problems. I'm opposed      to plastic mulch.    </p>    <p>      Seth Morgan<br />      Ardsley, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      Sorry to see such a spread on plastic mulches. While they      do have their positive aspects, they're ecologically      expensive to manufacture and impossible to dispose of in      any sound way . . . and there are reasonable alternatives:    </p>    <p>      1. Those who use wood for cooking and heating find      themselves with sheets of bark lying all over the wood      chopping area. A thick mulch of bark should have nearly the      same soil-warming properties as black poly, provide better      aeration and (slowly) add humus to the soil.    </p>    <p>      2. Old newssheet is a fair mulch, if layered thickly, and      will eventually break down into humus.    </p>    <p>      Both materials will add acidity to the soil but this can      counteracted with wood ash . . . a light application goes a      long way.    </p>    <p>      I'm sure other TMEN readers know of good mulches that add      to the environment rather than foul it, Why not put that      information together in an article? But please, MOTHER,      plastics should be avoided as much as possible.    </p>    <p>      J. D. Cuddy<br />      Shevlin, Minn.    </p>    <p>      Re "Plastic Mulch" and "More Plastic Mulch!" I'm very      interested in reading such accounts of other people's      experiments and experiences, and I intend to do my own      experimenting with black poly in hopes of extending my      growing season . . . but I can't imagine any other      advantage to be gained from using it, rather than a deep      organic mulch. The latter is far cheaper, decomposes      completely, adds much to the soil, retains water . . . and      is at least somewhat more appealing to the senses. I've      successfully "sterilized" an area in several different ways      (cardboard, shredded leaves, newspaper) without spending a      cent . . . and my mulch replenished the soil.    </p>    <p>      By the way, at the prices quoted it would cost me $67.50      for enough 1 1/2 mil plastic and $140 for enough six mil to      cover a vegetable garden that only provides for four      adults, one child and, occasionally, a few friends.    </p>    <p>      I reckon that if one had very little space and only enough      onto "plant seeds or seedlings in already made holes and      reap the abundant crop that gets bigger and better each      year", plash mulch might be suitable. As for me, I need      more evidence befog I'll consider investing a large chunk      of to mention my money-in plastic mulch    </p>    <p>      Michael L. Marty<br />      Demon, Texas    </p>    <p>      One of the basic premises of organic gardening is not only      to harvest a plentiful yield with few weeds, but also to      produce fruits and vegetables that are as nutritionally      valuable as possible This can only be accomplished by      replenishing the soil before during, or after every growing      season. I read of no such provision in either article on      plastic mulch.    </p>    <p>      Every crop depletes the soil of certain ingredients and      after period of years, land can get "all worn out", so to      speak. Nutrients must be returned to the soil in the form      of organic mulch, compost or green manure so that plants      can absorb needed nutrients and return them to us.<br />    </p>    <p>      For my part, I'll continue to keep my soil healthy so that      it may keep me healthy.    </p>    <p>      Lil Woods<br />      San Diego, Calif    </p>    <p>      Well, gang, as you'll recall, we <em>said</em> that "we're      still not convinced it's a good idea but there's definitely      a growing trend (among some otherwise conservative organic      gardeners, too)to plastic mulch". Quite frankly, nobody      around here likes the idea either but (1) we've already run      article after article on natural mulches, (2) it's our job      to report on and bring to your attention alternatives      <em>of all kinds</em> and (3) plastic mulches do seem to      work-at least in the short run-for people like      F. P. Hughes and Tom Doyle.    </p>    <p>      Whether the infernal plastic proves out over the long term      or not (and we rather doubt it) remains to be seen . . .      but it <em>is</em> the mark of a rational adult to at least      consider an alien idea. Perhaps if a few more of us set up      test plots where natural versus plastic mulch can be      compared side-by-side over a ten year period, we do away      with plastic in the garden once and for all . . . or get a      pleasant surprise when the godawful stuff surprises us with      desirable results. Either way, and with no malice      aforethought, we have learned something.<br />    </p>    <p>      For our part, we'd say that gardeners who want to blanket      their vegetable patches with a single sheet of something      would be better off to "Carpet Their Gardens" with in cold      rug of natural fibres as suggested by John Krill on pages      48-49 of this issue.- The Editors.    </p>
