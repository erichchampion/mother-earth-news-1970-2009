                    <h3>      THE OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, CHAPTER 4<br />      WATER MANAGEMENT    </h3>    <div class="sidebar">    <h3>      KEN KERN    </h3>    <p>      Ken Kern, author of THE OWNER-BUILT HOME and THE      OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, is an amazing fellow and everyone      interested in decentralist, back-to-the-land, rational      living should know of his work. Back in 1948 he began      collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural      construction materials and techniques. He combed the world      for ideas, tried them and started writing about his      experiments.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's      articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN REVOLUTION.      Ken has also issued a three year series of pieces (called      TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun pit design of his      has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.    </p>    <p>      This series of Ken Kern's work is being taken both from      OWNER-BUILT HOME (already published) and OWNER-BUILT      HOMESTEAD (to be published). To give you advance chapters      of HOMESTEAD as they are written I have to break my      presentation of HOME on an irregular basis for which I      apologize. If you want HOME all at once it's available      right now direct from Ken Kern, Sierra Route, Oakhurst,      California 93844 for $10.00.    </p>    <p>      -MOTHER    </p>    </div>    <p>      A brief presentation of the Hydrologic Cycle was included      in the preceding chapter. My intention was to impress the      reader with an important concept: <em>water is a function      of the land.</em> Like the land, and things which grow on      the land, water too has been badly misused. We may settle      in arid regions where streams flow only during cold,      non-growing seasons. So we have to divert water from stream      channels or impound it behind dams. Then we over-irrigate,      causing nitrate leaching and the establishment of      pathogenic fungi. Commercial fertilizers and poisonous      sprays are then used to counteract these evils. Or we may      farm the rich bottom land-but must first drain the      meadows and valleys of stored water. The tile drainage      systems employed lower the water table and contribute to      down-stream flooding. We may cut or burn forests and native      grass to graze cattle or plow the land. Then soil-depleting      cultivated plants replace native vegetation: tillage      practices leave the land stirred up and exposed to the      ravages of wind and rain. Agriculture then becomes, for the      most part, an occupation dealing with floods and drought,      erosion and infertility, insects and diseased plants.    </p>    <p>      Consequently, as a function of the land, water and water      management become very closely interrelated to soil and the      way in which soil is used. Organisms and plant roots living      in the soil remove <em>oxygen</em> and respire <em>carbon      dioxide.</em> This free movement of carbon dioxide out, and      oxygen into the soil is a first criterion of healthy plant      growth. Standing surface water, for instance, may      contribute to crop damage by impeding this action. Flooded      soil encourages undesirable bacterial transformations: when      soil aeration is poor, plant roots have difficulty in      excreting carbon dioxide, and beneficial aerobic (airborne)      microorganisms cannot function. Anerobic (waterborne)      micro-organisms then take over and reduce valuable nitrates      to toxic nitrite and gaseous nitrogen.    </p>    <p>      A leaching action-caused from excessive rainfall or      irrigation-also contributes to an impoverished      soil-condition by washing essential nitrates through the      soil profile. The effect of percolating water on a soil's      nutrient reserve depends a lot on the structure and texture      of the soil. Heavy (clay type) soils will hold more water      without nutrient leaching. The structural aggregates of      heavy soils retain nutrients as they allow water, to drain      around them.    </p>    <p>      Tillage operations also impede plant growth-mostly      through compaction of the soil. Heavy equipment compaction      reduces oxygen diffusion as well as obstructing root      growth. Contrary to popular opinion, even light tillage      wastes more soil moisture than it saves. As particles of      soil are stirred up by tillage equipment, all sides are      exposed to the air-which permits that much more      moisture to evaporate. No more moisture is available to a      crop which is cultivated than is available to a comparable      crop uncultivated. One despairs at the wasted effort in      "dust mulching": once a dry layer is formed on the surface      of the soil, no amount of hoeing or cultivating can      appreciably reduce the evaporation rate. And the common      practice of lightly cultivating immediately after      irrigation can be even more detrimental to a crop.      Cultivated soils tend to cake and crust on wetting and      drying: few empty pores remain where oxygen can diffuse,      and water is held against drainage. Cultivation destroys      surface "feeder" roots. And for other reasons, too, (which      will be detailed in the following chapter) the Roto Tiller      is seen as the most undesirable piece of equipment employed      on most "organic" homesteads.    </p>    <p>      A proper water management program can be established once      one understands the basic principles of water usage in      relation to the growing plant and in relation to the soil.      When it rains-or when one irrigates-old air is      forced out and new air is pulled into the soil by the      downward water movement. In its passage through the      atmosphere, water absorbs traces of carbon dioxide which      make it slightly acid. Certain minerals are thereby      partially dissolved by this acidity: water acts as a      solvent for the carbon dioxide and oxygen that the plant      obtains from the atmosphere. Water is also the medium      through which the plant obtains nitrogen and mineral      nutrients from the soil to the plant and combines with      nutrients entering plant leaves directly from the air.    </p>    <p>      In a "good" soil (as defined in the following chapter on      Soil Management) water is quickly absorbed. A certain      amount of reserve is held in the soil by a sponge effect      (2/3 saturation is considered an optimum water content of      most soils). Excess water is held in the water table. The      minimum permissible depth of the water table depends upon      the crop being grown: fruit trees, for instance, require a      deeper water table than does grass.    </p>        <p>      The first principle, then, of proper water management is to      increase the subsoil water storage capacity at depths where      it will be free from evaporative losses. Water in subsoil      depths should benefit the plant through a low "capillary"      feeding of the root system. When one realizes that wheat,      beans and peas, for instance, use about 200 pounds of water      for every pound of dry matter produced, one can better      appreciate the importance of this dynamic subsoil water      storage. Again, the amount of water transpired for each      pound of dry matter produced is much less on good soils      than on poor ones.    </p>    <p>      As water transpires from a leaf, it has to absorb heat in      order to vaporize. This is one way by which water regulates      the temperature in a plant. During the middle part of a      sunny day, the photosynthesis process can be reduced by      sprinkling the plants during this hot, midday period.<br />      The cooling effect of midday sprinkling consequently      reduces respiration and increases net photosynthesis. The      time-worn advice about sprinkling only during the cool      evening hours of the day is just one more old-wives'      tale.<br />    </p>    		<p>		It doesn't take a very long farming experience in a    semi-arid region to fully appreciate some basic water    management concepts. For one thing, one should try to control    as many environmental growth factors as possible-so    that water becomes the <em>one</em> limiting factor. Someone    found that the application of manure to unfertile soil    reduced from 500 gallons to 300 gallons of water required to    produce 1 pound of corn. Proper fertilization is essential    for an extensive and vigorous root development-which is    in turn necessary for an effective exploitation of subsoil    moisture. Surface evaporation can be significantly limited by    mulch <em>planting.</em>    </p>		<p>		      More will be said about mulch planting in ensuing chapters,      but to the extent that mulch saves water and soil, it      should be touched upon here. Mulch planting is the planting      of new crops directly in the residue of the previous crop      without prior land preparation. Crop residues left on the      soil through winter helps to conserve water through      absorption, and also in the form of accumulated snow that      would otherwise be blown off.    </p>    <p>      Contour farming is becoming widely used on sloping land.      Planting on the contour naturally reduces the velocity of      water movement: more water is conserved through soil      infiltration and percolation.    </p>    <p>      Crop management practices can become further methods of      controlling environmental growth factors. The earliest safe      planting date should find seed in the ground. This enables      the seedlings to utilize accumulated winter moisture and at      the same time lowers the evapo-transpiration rate. Crop      sequence is also important: shallow rooted row crops like      corn do not fully utilize available soil moisture; deep      rooted crops like grains do. So one is prudent to follow-up      a corn crop with grain or alfalfa-which will benefit      from the soil moisture untapped by the corn.    </p>    <p>      <em>Fallowing</em> is a common farming practice where the      distribution of rainfall is uneven and sparse. The land is      not cultivated, but allowed to store water for use by the      next crop. That is, one crop is grown from moisture      received in 2 years. Fallowing is an inefficient method of      moisture conservation, but does illustrate the extent to      which water can be stored in a heavy soil.    </p>    <p>      It is well-nigh impossible to indicate how much water a      given plant requires during its growing season. For one      thing, soil properties have a great bearing on moisture      retention: the coarser the particle, the less water it will      hold. Sandy soils have a capacity of less than 1-inch of      available water for a foot depth, whereas clay soils retain      more than 3 inches. For a vegetable garden, an equivalent      of 1-inch of rain is considered adequate in a single      downpour: a garden 1/10 acre in size requires 3000 gallons!      Most vegetables require .10 to .20 inches of water a day or      about 3 to 9 inches a month. Research at Kansas Experiment      Station disclosed some interesting facts about irrigation:      wheat seeded in dry soil yielded 5 bushels per acre; where      the soil was wet 1 foot deep, the yield was 9 bushels; soil      wet 2 feet deep yielded 15 bushels; soil wet 3 feet deep      yielded 27 bushels.    </p>    <p>      The competition between plants for available water is      fierce. Small plants, for instance, have little chance for      survival when they are within reach of tree roots. Crop      yields can be increased in very dry seasons by increasing      the distance between rows. This reduces the demand for      water during the early part of the growing season, which      therefore increases the amount of soil water available as      the plant approaches maturity. In cases where land is      plentiful and water scarce, it has been found to be more      efficient to irrigate a large area with a small amount of      water, than it is to irrigate a small area with a small      amount of water. Seven inches of water on 4 acres produces      three times the crop yield of 30 inches applied to 1 acre.      Irrigation is a Pandora's box: its use raises the lid of      many problems. These problems are associated mainly with      soil management: drainage, soil structure, aeration,      leveling, organic matter, mineral deficiency and toxicity,      salt accumulation and general soil infertility. As pointed      out in the previous chapter, water development has subtle      but far-reaching influences: the hydrologic balance can be      easily upset by man tampering with his environment.      Introducing irrigation into a valley is an especially good      example of how this balance can be upset. More      particularly, one's homestead soil and plant population can      be adversely affected-especially in arid regions.      Irrigation water contains salt. Most of the water applied      evaporates-either through the plant or on the soil      surface. The salt remains, and must be washed away into the      subsoil below the root zone, or into drainage canals. About      one-fourth the amount of water used in irrigation is thus      used to wash the salt out of the growing zone. And with the      bath water goes the baby: most irrigated soils suffer      severe nitrogen and phosphate deficiencies caused from the      leaching of plant nutrients.<br />    </p>    		<p>		An accurate prediction of a soil's drainage    requirements thus becomes the first element in selecting land    for irrigation. As previously illustrated, water drainage    through a sandy soil is .more than twice as rapid as through    a heavy, clay soil. Soil depth, degree of land slope, and    regularity of topography also influence irrigation procedure.    Any amount of land leveling can be very expensive. Sandy    soils which erode readily should be limited to low slopes.    Clay and gravelly soils can be irrigated on steeper slopes    without so much danger from erosion.		</p>    <p>      Actual water supply is another, equally important      consideration for the selection of an irrigation method.      Supply should, of course, be adequate and reliable. A      small, constant-flow stream is adaptable to sprinkler      irrigation whereas a large intermittent stream is adaptable      to surface irrigation. To achieve the maximum utilization      of soil and water, deep rooting into the subsoil should be      encouraged. Light irrigations applied frequently will      restrict root penetration and increase the degree of      drought damage when dry periods occur.    </p>    <p>      Soil and water factors favor one or another of six      different methods of irrigation. These can be summarized in      table form:<br />    </p>        <p>      A small farm pond is practically an essential requirement      of every owner-built homestead. As a reservoir, it becomes      ideal for any type of crop-irrigation program. It can be      used for livestock watering, for raising fish, ducks and      geese. The fringe benefits of a farm pond are many: for      recreational uses the pond can function for summer swimming      and winter skating. It also serves as a convenient water      source in case of fire.<br />    </p>    		<p>		Without question there have been more unsuccessful pond    building attempts than successful ones. Reasons for failure    are many and varied. There isn't space here to go into all    the engineering details of small dam construction, but some    of the obvious criteria should at least be mentioned.    </p>		<p>      Keep several things in mind when choosing a pond site.      First, seek a site that offers the maximum amount of      storage area with smallest dam practicable. Ideally the      site will be located at a point higher than the      homestead-for possibilities of gravity-flow      irrigation. A steep-sided valley where the stream runs slow      is ideal: the greater cross sectional rise the shorter the      dam; the flatter the longitudinal section the further      upstream water will be impounded.    </p>    <p>      Second, investigate the geological strata closely. A      concrete dam is a practical consideration where outcropping      of granite or basalt extend across the valley or near the      surface or where a good rock foundation is present. Other      types of loose rock outcroppings along the banks should be      avoided. Sometimes a shallow layer of soil will cover      objectionable gravel and shattered rock. Ideally, for an      earth fill dam, a site having a large percentage of clayey      material with some silt or sand should be chosen. Too much      clay causes cracks when dry and slippage when wet; too much      sand causes seepage percolation.<br />    </p>    		<p>An adequately designed spillway is most important in    farm pond construction. The purpose of the spillway is to    carry away surplus runoff: it may consist of a    mechanical-type control or a drainage ditch planted to some    protective ground cover. This latter type spillway should be    clear of the dam and cut out of solid ground.<br />    Farm pond management is another very much involved    topic-and again will only be briefly touched upon here.    A pond managed for wildlife, fish and recreation should be    fenced. This will protect the spillway, fill and pond-edge    from livestock trampling. A sharp bank should be maintained    around the perimeter of the pond to avoid warm and stagnant    water. Water less than 2 feet deep has little value for fish,    and shallow water encourages mosquito and weed growth.    </p>		<p>      Tree, shrub, and deep-rooted legume growth should be      discouraged from growing on the fill. Trees planted around      the pond should be coniferous varieties-not      broadleafed-to minimize evaporation. A row of      correctly placed conifers will reduce evaporation losses by      sheltering the pond from winds which might otherwise ruffle      the surface of the water. A wave action increases the      evaporation manifold. Wave action and rain action are the      major sources of erosion in a pond.<br />    </p>    		<p>		Erosion from rain may be a fitting subject on which to    end this chapter. Erosion is like pollution: it suggests some    grave mismanagement practice at some distant point of origin.    With erosion, it is the whole system of agri-business which    is at fault. Rains, for instance, are heaviest during that    part of the growing season when row crops are least able to    provide ground cover. This fact suggests a different    practice, one that allows a ground cover <em>and</em> row    crop growth simultaneously. Some far-sighted agriculturalists    found that when <em>weeds</em> were grown with corn, the corn    yield increased.    </p>		<p>      Weeds are not the water robbers that people once imagined      them to be: they are actually conditioners of the soil.      Weed growth can open up the soil and enlarge the feeding      zone of other crops. Crop roots will follow weed roots deep      into the subsoil in search of water.<br />      A proper water management requires that the soil is used      within its capacity. One's homestead may be sectioned into      crop land, pasture, woodlot and wildlife refuge, depending      upon soil structure and depth, movement of water and air      through the soil, land slope, and susceptibility to water      and wind erosion. A complete thesis on soil management is      called for at this time. This will be presented in the      following chapter.<br />      <br />      <em>(The chapter on soil management will be presented in a      later issue of MOTHER.</em> - <em>Ed.)</em>    </p>    <h3>      THE OWNER-BUILT HOME, VOLUME 4, CHAPTER 3<br />      FREE-FORM HOUSE    </h3>    <p>      During World War I architect Gaudi was busy developing a      new curving free-form architecture in Spain; architect      Rudolf Steiner was independently establishing metaphysical      credence to the curving freeforms of his famed Goetheanum      in Dornach, Switzerland. At the close of the war a group of      architecturally disillusioned German designers formed a      discussion group for purposes of exploring the problems of      establishing an improved house. Gaudi and Steiner were      searched out, and a "round-robin" correspondence began      which lasted for some 20 years. Mendelsohn, Kiesler and      Finsterlin continued in their search for an entirely new      free-form building style, but most of the original group      were wooed into the more prosperous International Style.    </p>    <p>      In more recent years a group of younger architects are      building upon what was learned from the German pioneers.      Foremost among these are the Italian, Leonardo Ricci; the      Americans, Paolo Soleri and Bruce Goff; the Brazilian,      Oscar Niemeyer; the Mexican, Juan O'Gorman; and the      Britishers, Hans Hollein and Walter Pichler.    </p>        <p>      There is a great deal about the free-form house that is      applicable to owner-builder construction. This type of      building is not a mere freeflow art form or a return to      nature, but, as Kiesler states, "it derives from living a      life dedicated to fundamentals rather than to mechanized      equipment and interior decoration." The measurements of the      final form and shape of the house are determined by actual      requirements in height, width, and depth of the various      areas designed for eating, sleeping, living and working.      Every defined function can be closed off from other areas      or opened up, making one continuous space. Finsterlin      talked of the New House as being organic: a person inside      such a house would be as inside an organism, wandering from      organ to organ, "the giving and receiving symbiont of a      giant fossil mother body."<br />      Designers of free-form homes feel that there should be a      greater independence from our constantly increasing      automated way of life. By way of architecture they seek to      encourage a more natural way of living. Kiesler talks of      basing his house on simple, healthful and direct ways of      living, where work can also be recreational.    </p>    <p>      One basic difference between the free-form building type      and traditional houses is that the free-form building is      continuous shell, not post and beam construction. The floor      of a free-form room curves at the rim into wall, and the      wall curves uninterrupted into ceiling. Much thought has      gone into the elimination of the flat horizontal plane as      the area of movement for people. The traditional solid and      opaque floor would cut through a free-form room like a      "pathological diaphragm." Glassy, transparent floors were      therefore included in the plan:    </p>    <p>      The bare foot will caress the floor sculptures with every      step, bringing new life to the neglected tactile sense and      enriching the reactions which nowadays reach the level of      our consciousness only as the grossest fragments, instead      of as inconceivable delicate and pure melodies of the      material world by which we are surrounded.-Kiesler.    </p>        <p>      Each sleeping section of a free-form dwelling is designed      as an individual living room. Private baths may be included      in each individual living quarter.    </p>    <p>      There is continuity of structure in a curving free-form      building which makes it more desirable than straight-line      types. Conventional structure is put together from      separate, articulated pieces, whereas free-form is composed      of simple, continuous materials; angles break the flow of      the eye but curves lead smoothly from one surface to      another. There is also a significant structural. advantage      in continuity of structure. Forces applied at any point in      a building structure should be distributed in an equal flow      throughout. Obviously, these forces are less apt to flow at      right angles to one another-which is what we demand      of the standard frame or masonry house.    </p>    <p>      Only the more serious and seasoned owner-builder should      attempt to build a free-form structure-with floor      curving into wall and wall curving into ceiling. To build      thus one must develop a knack for spreading concrete on      curving forms (concrete plaster being the best suited      material for the job). Regular poured concrete is much too      limited because of the necessary straight-edge formwork      required. Plaster, however is a plastic form material that      all but eliminates elaborate formwork. Plaster is applied      to a reinforcement which is itself a form-in the      manner of the sculptor's <em>armature,</em> or      frame-support.<br />    </p>    <p>      Lime is the type of plaster used in the earliest      civilizations. Nowadays hydrated lime is used as a      plasticizing agent, to increase workability of the cement      mortar. Diatomaceous earths and fire-clay (mortar creme)      are better, as they are less harmful to the workman's skin.    </p>    <p>      Gypsum and portland cement are the two most commonly used      binders in plaster work. A type of waterproof cement called      <em>plastic</em> it preferable to common cement, as it      spreads easier.    </p>    <p>      To achieve first quality work, only clean, well-graded      plaster sand should be used. Where available, coarser      aggregate should be used in the base coats. Vermiculite and      perlite aggregates are used where a lightweight, acoustical      treatment is desired.    </p>    <p>      Where plastering is done against a rigid surface, a stucco      netting having large openings should be used so that      plaster will be pushed through to the backing, completely      embedding the metal. A special <em>furring</em> nail is      used to attach reinforcement. It holds the reinforcement      out at least one-fourth inch beyond the backing, permitting      plaster to be forced behind the reinforcement. Expanded      metal lath and gypsum lath are used where there is no      backing. Again, the plaster should completely cover the      mesh.    </p>        <p>      The correct proportioning, mixing, and application of      plaster is essential for quality results. The table      included here will assist the owner-builder in his      selection and use of the common types of plaster. With some      trial-and-error experiences one can soon develop a facility      for spreading plaster. It is also important to buy and      become familiar with the right plastering tools: a high      quality <em>steel trowel</em> for application; a      lightweight <em>hawk</em> for carrying mortar; a <em>wood      float</em> for gliding over the surface, filling voids and      leveling bumps; a <em>darby</em> for preliminary smoothing      and leveling.    </p>    <p>      There are methods of free-form construction other than      plastering over an armature framework. Architect Paolo      Soleri demonstrated one method when he built his 25 ft.      wide by 35 ft. long desert home. A huge mound of sand was      first piled up. The mound was then scored with V-shaped      indentations into which reinforcing bars were placed. Wire      mesh was then laid over the entire mold, after which a      3-inch-thick layer of concrete was poured. When the      concrete was set a small bulldozer was used to excavate the      material under the concrete shell, piling it on either side      of the building. The floor level is 6 feet below ground      level and the concrete roof meets the desert floor on the      two long sides. Both ends open into excavated patios.    </p>    <p>      The final form of Soleri's "earth house" is not unlike      Frank Lloyd Wright's <em>berm-type</em> building, designed      for cooperative homesteads in 1942. Wright pushed dirt up      against the outside walls. Good insulation and protection      from the elements was offered; it was economical      construction in that the outside walls below window sill      level did not have to be finished.    </p>    <p>      Earth forms have also been used in certain types of      lift-slab construction-a technique nicely adapted to      free-form building procedure.    </p>    <p>      In 1956 Lawrence Caster invented a simple method for      building conical dome adobe houses. Experiences in Mexico      demonstrated that anyone with even the most rudimentary      skill in masonry construction can erect this all-adobe      house. (Total cost: 60 working days and $28.64 for      materials.) Carter's <em>positioning machine</em> is      designed to serve as a guide in laying the adobe walls. It      consists of a short arm revolving about a center pole in a      horizontal plane at floor level. From the outer end of this      arm run two parallel longer arms which extend back past the      center pole to the wall on the opposite side. These arms      raise and lower as well as support a shaped wooden guide      against which the adobe blocks are laid. Complete drawings      for building the machine will be sent upon request.    </p>    <p>      In Europe a number of circular masonry houses have been      built. But except for Carter, no one has been sufficiently      dedicated to the circular wall to engineer a system of      construction which would make this type of design entirely      feasible if not more economical than conventional types.    </p>    <p>      One such system of circular wall construction involves the      use of a central pipe and a radius-wire controlling      circumference of the outside walls of the house. I first      experimented with this technique using the Magdiel Form to      build rammed earth, concrete, and stone walls 6 to 24      inches thick. The principle is entirely sound; so long as      the central pipe is set straight and plumb, the walls will      likewise be plumb. A spacing radius-wire is attached from      the form to the central pipe, and as the wall progresses in      height the wire is raised to a new position level with the      form. The lever mechanism of the Magdiel Form permits      immediate release of the form walls.    </p>    <p>      The same technique can be employed in building thin-shell      circular concrete walls. After establishing the vertical      radius pipe, the concrete floor slab is poured, using a      screed board that revolves around the radius pipe. To build      the walls, a 5-inch high by 3-foot long aluminum form is      merely filled with concrete mixture and moved (while the      mixture is still wet) forward to a new position. A      continuous length of barbed wire for reinforcement is used      in each layer, which spirals from foundation to roof. The      form and construction procedure is similar to that of the      Geiger Horizontal Sliding Form (see Page 36, Chapter 2,      Volume II).    </p>        <p>      The circular walls of our (Ken Kern) present house were      built using a 2-inch-thick concrete sliding form. Stone      facing was later applied on th outside portion. The plan      and construction details of this ouse appear in the book,      Go Ahead and Live!    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of      importance)    </p>    <p>      <em>Fantastic Architecture:</em> Ulritch<br />      <em>Ways To A New Style in Architecture:</em> Rudolf      Steiner, 1927.<br />      <em>Soleri House:</em> Architectural Forum Magazine,      February 1961.<br />      <em>Manual of Lathing and Plastering:</em> National Bureau      for Lathing and Plastering, 1960.<br />      <em>Go Ahead and Live!:</em> Mildred Loomis and others,      1965, $4.00, School of Living, Brookvile, Ohio.    </p>
