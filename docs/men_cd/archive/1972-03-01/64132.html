                    <h5 id="byline">      by SUZANNA S. McDONALD    </h5>        <p>      Sea scrounging-for everything from clams and mussels      to crabs to bait, cat food and fertilizer - is both      easy and fun and the booty can be mouthwateringly      delectable. One of my favorite crannies for practicing the      art is a small cove in Maine. The inlet is ringed with red      granite boulders, quiet pine forests, low heaths and dark      bogs and contains bits of masts, hand-hewn beams, ribs and      other weathered remnants of an eighteenth-century merchant      shipwreck.    </p>    <p>      I'm told that - although the ship's passengers      managed to get ashore safely when the vessel ran aground      - many of them then slowly starved to death . . . not      because there was no food available, but because the      passengers were unable to recognize and harvest that food.      They needn't have perished: I know, because I personally      have taken clams, crabs, fish, huckleberries, cranberries      and rose hips from that same cove. I've also noted an      ancient Indian trash pile there that contains an      unbelievable number of clam shells. It stands to reason      that wild foods - abundantly available both before      and after the ship's disaster - must have filled the      bay just as profusely at the time of the wreck.    </p>    <p>      Of course, this one little inlet has not been unusually      blessed with free-for-the-gathering fare. Most coves,      estuaries and bays along the coasts of every large body of      water in the world seem - in their natural state      - to teem with edible life. It's not necessary to      have power boats and super-double-whammy fishing rigs to      harvest that bounty either: simple nets and poles are the      most complicated tools you'll need to practice the art of      the sea scrounge. The following general guide should get      you started.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO BE A SEA SCROUNGE</h3>    <p>      First, let me remind you that just as you don't pick any      old weed or mushroom for your table, you don't pick any old      clam or fish to eat, either. And <em>never, never,      NEVER</em> cook or eat any shellfish that are dead when you      find them . . . if the mollusk doesn't resist your efforts      to open his shell, or if the shell is broken, don't take      any chances with food poisoning. Keep your eyes open when      choosing a scrounging spot and follow these rules:    </p>    <p>      (1) AVOID POLLUTED AREAS. Diseases found in human waste,      such as typhoid and hepatitis, can be carried by shellfish.      Public health boards try to keep polluted beds posted with      warning signs . . . but signs have a way of disappearing.      Check before you take any shellfish.    </p>    <p>      Unposted pollution is another problem. Use your own      judgment, but I never scrounge near heavily traveled      highways or boat marinas where lead from exhaust fumes is      sure to have drifted onto the land and water. I stay far      away from any industrial plant that dumps mercury or other      chemical wastes and I avoid areas where crops are treated      with herbicides and pesticides that wash off the land and      into the sea. Steer clear of oil slicks too, unless you      happen to crave wild foods that taste of petroleum.    </p>    <p>      (2) OBEY LOCAL REGULATIONS. Laws that regulate the harvest      of seafoods were not made to thwart your good life but to      protect it. Restrictions, such as those governing the size      and quantity of clams and crabs that may be gathered, allow      the species a chance to replenish themselves.    </p>    <p>      (3) RESPECT PRIVATE PROPERTY. There's no need to get into a      trespassing hassle. Town docks and beaches are usually open      to the public, although nearby parking areas are sometimes      restricted to residents. If that's the case, park your car      somewhere else, walk in and ask an old-timer where to fish,      clam or crab. Old railroad beds, bridges, wharves and      public land are almost always OK.    </p>    <p>      (4) TAKE ONLY WHAT YOU CAN USE. It's a sad kind of murder      to gather too much seafood . . . and then let it just die      in a pail. All excess live critters should be put back to      survive and propagate.    </p>      <h3>CLAMS AND MUSSELS</h3>    <p>      Clams are dug and mussels are plucked at low tide . . . and      the soft-shell or steamer clam (also called the nannynose      or long clam in some parts) is especially easy to harvest.      The clam-found from North Carolina to Labrador on the      East Coast and from California to Alaska on the      West-digs itself only a few inches into sandy or      muckish mud between the high and low-tide lines. It feeds      itself by making a small access hole (through which it      extends its "neck" to siphon water) to the mud's surface.      This siphon hole is the clam's undoing because, if you      stamp your feet while walking across a good steamer clam      tidal flat, you'll be able to locate every one of the tasty      shellfish by the little squirt of water each sends up as it      retracts its neck.    </p>    <p>      Steamer clams tend to group and, when you've found one,      you've most likely found a lot of them. Check local      regulations to learn how many you may harvest, then grab a      basket and head for the flats. Almost any good digging tool      can be used for gathering steamers but there's a special      clamhook with long, thin prongs that makes the job easier      and is less damaging to the soft shells of this variety.      Foraging a meal-sized mess of nannynoses is generally a      quick and easy task.    </p>    <p>      You can clean the grit and mud from clams by hanging them      off the end of a dock in a wire basket (which will attract      a lot of fish and provide you with some truly superior      angling). You can also soak steamers (but <em>no</em>      <em>other</em> saltwater clam) and fresh water shellfish in      a tub of fresh water to which you've added a handful of      cornmeal. Change the water and add new meal twice a day and      let the long clams clean themselves for 48 hours. Scrub the      clams before you cook them.    </p>    <p>      The most common way to eat steamers is-you guessed      it-steamed. Place a bunch of the soft-shells in a      kettle, cover them with water and boil for about twenty      minutes. Then eat 'em right out of the shell dipped in your      favorite melted-butter sauce. Just flip the clams out,      strip away the papery brown membranes, swirl the delicious      little critters in the butter and pop 'em in your mouth. If      you're one of the queasy uninitiated, have someone else      prepare your first clam and keep your eyes closed until      it's down the hatch. The unaesthetic appearance will be      quickly forgotten once you discover the delectable taste.    </p>    <p>      Soft-shells can also be eaten raw, boiled, fried, baked,      chowdered, curried, spaghettied and stuffed . . . check any      good cookbook or Euell Gibbons' <em>STALKING THE BLUE-EYED      SCALLOP</em> for recipes. You'll have to shuck the clams      for most of these dishes but, with steamers, that's a snap.      Just slip a thin knife into either end of the shell and      sever the adductor muscles. When the shell comes apart, cut      the meat loose and trim off the siphon with scissors. Raw      clams can be juicy, so open them over a bowl to catch the      liquid which can be drunk hot, mixed with tomato juice and      Worcestershire sauce or added to stuffings.    </p>        <p>      Hard clams or quahogs are also found up and down the East      Coast but are harder to spot than steamers since they grow      under three or more feet of water in the muddy bottoms of      inlets and estuaries. Once located, however, this      particular shellfish <em>is</em> usually easy to harvest      because it has a very short siphon (this clam is sometimes      called the littleneck) which forces it to live just beneath      the mud's surface. You can, in fact, gather littlenecks as      the Indians sometimes did . . . by feeling for them with      your toes as you walk in the offshore muck. Hard      clams-just like the soft-shells-tend to be      social creatures and, where you find one, you'll generally      find more.    </p>    <p>      Scrub and carefully inspect the shells of your hard clams      before you eat them. Very small quahogs are called      cherrystones and are delicious raw. Larger hard clams will      open if steamed for 20 minutes and can then be gobbled down      as is or served in any of the dishes suggested for      soft-shell clams.    </p>        <p>      Mussels can also be prepared in the same manner and perhaps      the best of the lot is the very dark-colored blue mussel.      It's found on the East Coast from North Carolina all the      way up to far, far northern Canada and on some parts of the      West Coast. Many other varieties are also edible, but steer      away from the 4-5" straited mussel which ranges from a      brownish to a yellow-greenish color and is disagreeable in      taste.    </p>    <p>      Mussel hunters on the West Coast must contend with a      special problem. Pacific mussels are contaminated during      the warmer months by a poisonous micro-organism which the      shellfish strain from the water while feeding. These      plankton-like little plants are luminescent and-at      the height of their season-lend a sparkling, fiery      glow to wave crests and boat wakes. The danger of      contamination from these creatures is so great that      California forbids the gathering of mussels from May to      October. During the remainder of the year, though, these      West Coast shellfish are just as nourishing and delectable      as their eastern brethren.    </p>    <p>      Mussels are found on wharf pilings at the low-water line or      on rocks just reached by the shallow waters of low tide.      Live, useable mussels will be attached to their roosting      spots by a web of strong, silken black threads called the      byssus. <em>Never take an unattached mussel.</em> Pluck the      good ones and remove their "beards" by pulling the threads      toward the large end of the shells with your thumb and      forefinger.    </p>    <p>      These tough little mollusks are almost impossible to open      raw, but that's no loss because uncooked mussels are pretty      unappetizing. Scrub the shells with steel wool or a wire      brush and steam them for 20 minutes until they open. Serve      with melted-butter sauce.    </p>    <p>      Before we move on to crabbing, I would like to again      emphasize that all shellfish should be scrubbed well and      inspected closely before being cooked or eaten. Immediately      discard any mollusk that doesn't close tightly when handled      or that has a cracked or broken shell. <em>Never cook or      eat a dead clam or mussel.</em>   </p>     <h3>CRABBING</h3>        <p>      Crab catching can be exciting, challenging and a lot of      fun. The best-known East Coast variety is the blue crab      (known in the South as the sea crab). This crustacean is      large (about 6" across), its back is dark green, stomach      white, trim red and legs blue. It frequents muddy shores,      estuaries and the bottoms of bays although the best hunting      is often the channels that cut through salt marshes.    </p>    <p>      Crabs can be difficult to see in the shallows. Their      natural coloring is such an effective camouflage that they      are easily mistaken for just another ripple in the dull      green water. The trick is to keep a picture of the crab in      your mind and search the waters until the image in your      head merges with the real live crab on the bottom.    </p>        <p>      There are three ways to go after the blue: with a net,      baited line or trap. The first is a real sporting      proposition.    </p>    <p>      The crab is a sensitive, alert creature and sneaking up on      one with net in hand requires some doing. Wear sneakers to      protect your feet and proceed with the utmost silence and      caution. When you locate one of the crustaceans, approach      him from the rear (if you can) and scoop him up with a      long, quick sweep. Your scoop has to be faster than his      swim and, chances are, you'll miss. That's when the fun      begins . . . because if you pursue the defiant little      devil, he'll soon turn and offer to fight you with his      dexterous-and dangerous-pincers.    </p>    <p>      Once your crab turns, scoop him into the net or just wave a      stick in front of him. The spunky crustacean will most      probably clamp a claw on the proffered piece of wood and      tenaciously hang on until you can pick him up and dump him      into a box or bag. If you have to handle the ornery little      dickens, grab him only from the rear. A snap from those      pinchers can inflict a jagged and dirty wound that will be      quite painful.    </p>    <p>      The other two crabbing methods aren't nearly as exciting      but are surer bets, especially for the inexperienced      forager. When a weighted line is baited with a fish head      and dropped to the bottom of likely crab waters, the      crustaceans will latch onto the offering just as firmly as      they'll pinch the piece of wood I mentioned earlier. When      they do, haul them up and net them. Increase your haul by      working as many as a dozen of these drop lines at once.      Crab traps work much the same way except that they close up      around the unsuspecting blues when they gather to feast on      the bait fastened in the centers of the snares.    </p>        <p>      Many other crabs make good eating, too. As a matter of      fact, all true crabs are edible . . . but some are so small      that the effort is hardly worthwhile. Most coastal areas of      this country, however, have at least one notably famous      local crab.    </p>    <p>      In New England look for the oval-shaped yellow-brown rock      crab on sandy bottoms in shallow water just below the      low-tide line. You'll also find rock crabs hiding along the      zone between the tides. The Jonah crab, with its brick red      back, yellowish belly and rough carapace favors the open      sandy shores of northeastern waters, too. State laws in the      region forbid non-residents from using crab pots on the      crustaceans but both crabs can be netted or caught on      baited lines quite easily.    </p>    <p>      The best eating on the West Coast is provided by the large      dungeness crab, a reddish-brown member of the      <em>Cancer</em> family that can be taken in traps from the      bottoms of tidal flats and bays, and the South has its      stone and lady crabs.    </p>    <p>      Hard-shelled crabs should be boiled or steamed in sea water      or in fresh water to which some salt and vinegar has been      added. Dump the crustaceans into the boiling liquid and      cook them for ten minutes after the water has come back to      a boil. Just as with lobsters, this is the quickest, most      humane way to kill the hard-shells.    </p>    <p>      Cool, but do not soak, the crabs in cold running water      after they've finished boiling. Break off the claws and      legs and lay them aside. Remove the craw, the devil's      fingers and the abdomen or "key", which is the fleshy part      tucked under the top shell. Break each body into two pieces      along the seam made by the recess from which you removed      the abdomen, crack the legs and claws with a pair of pliers      . . . and you're all set to pick out the meat to use as is      or sauteed, deviled, gumboed or added to salads.    </p>    <p>      The so-called soft-shelled crabs are really just blues that      have moulted out of their shells. Until their new coverings      harden the crabs are sluggish and helpless and can be      picked up without fear. Look for them on the bottom under      large rocks where they sometimes hide.    </p>    <p>      Once the craw (a sac located just behind the eyestalks) and      devil's fingers or lungs (spongy strips found under the      tips of the upper shell) are removed, the entire      soft-shelled crab can be sauteed in butter, broiled or      dipped in egg and bread crumbs and fried. Fried soft-shell      makes a great sandwich on a hard roll spread with      mayonnaise, sprinkled with a little cayenne pepper and      garnished with lettuce or nasturtium leaves.    </p>    <p>      Hard shell or soft, though, remember to always check local      limits and regulations before harvesting crabs and      <em>never cook or eat a dead crustacean.</em>    </p>      <h3>POLE FISHING</h3>    <p>      There's nothing like a simple 10-15 foot bamboo pole for      fishing off docks or in coves, inlets and estuaries . . .      no need to lay out lots of bread for swanky rods, reels and      lures. Tie a hook to your cane pole with 15 feet or so of      line, bait it with a fish head, a worm or some meat and      dangle that hook in the water. It'll do just as well as the      fancy rigs and can be put together, complete with snap-on      bobber, for less than $5.00.    </p>    <p>      A myriad of fishes-including mullet, bluefish, sea      bass, flounder and fluke in the ocean . . . and perch,      black bass, crappie and catfish in the brackish      backwaters-can be caught in sea scrounge territory.      While the sport fisherman might get bigger thrills and tell      bigger tales, the sea scrounger gets better meals for less      money in a shorter time.    </p>    <p>      Some of the best pole fishing can be done from wharves,      expecially around the canneries of New England . . . on      good days you'll take smelt and pollack as fast as you can      get your hook in and out of the water. Bait with whelk foot      or some other tough meat-so you can catch several      fish on the same piece of bait-and set your snap-on      bobber to hold the hook at a depth of 4 to 8 feet.    </p>        <p>      Two more fish that can be found around wharves, as well as      among the rocks along the coast, are the cunner and the      tautog. The cunner is aggressive and hits the hook hard . .      . while the larger tautog is a cautious sneak who darts out      from his hiding place to take a quick nibble at your bait      before scooting back to cover. Fish for both close to the      bottom using a small hook baited with just about anything.    </p>    <p>      These four fish are all very tasty and easy to prepare. Cut      the heads and tails off your smelt, squeeze them from the      tail forward to eviscerate them, and fry in butter. Smelt      are also good if you roll them in egg and bread-crumbs      before tossing them in the pan. The other three are best      filleted: split them down the back on either side of the      dorsal fins and along each side approximately in the      middle, then remove the boneless sections of meat from the      upper halves of the bodies. They can be baked, boiled,      fried or corned.    </p>    <p>      When you latch onto an eel-and every sea scrounge      fisherman will once in a while-don't throw it away in      disgust. Eels are mean, ugly, slimy, hard to clean . . .      and some of the best eating you'll find anywhere. Once      you've landed an eel and removed the hook (for which a hook      disgorger can be a lifesaver), cut its skin all the way      around the body just behind the head and peel it off with a      pair of pliers. Then slit the snakelike fish all the way up      the bottom, take out the intestines and sever the head. The      cleaned eel can be cut into fillets after the meat has been      firmed by a short stay in the refrigerator. Boil, fry,      pickle or use the eel fillets in Bouillabaisse.    </p>      <h3>SEINE FISHING</h3>        <p>      The easiest, quickest way to obtain bait for your pole      fishing, food for your cat, fertilizer for your garden and      sometimes a surprise or two for your supper is by making a      sweep with a seine net. The seine is a relatively      small-meshed oblong net with floats on the long top edge      and weights along the bottom. The short vertical sides of      the rectangle are tied to poles which are used as handles      when pulling the net through the water. Make sure your      seine is at least 3' x 6' . . . the smaller postage stamp      varieties are inefficient and utterly frustrating.    </p>    <p>      Seining is a two-man operation, one person on each pole.      Try to keep the weighted side dragging the bottom for      greatest efficiency. The net must billow out behind you as      you walk along, to form a pocket in which small fish and      other shallowwater denizens can be trapped. Quickly sweep      through an area near the shore, bring the poles together at      the end of the turn and dump your catch on the beach or      into tubs. Sort through the pile of sea life, taking what      you can use and returning the rest to the water.    </p>    <p>      Most of the rewards of seine fishing will be fish one to      five inches long-too small for the table but just      right for bait, cat food and fertilizer-but occasionally      you'll come up with something worth eating. Schools of      deeper-water fish are sometimes driven in close to shore by      storms or predators and we once captured a fine mess of      whiting in our seine.    </p>    <p>      You can purchase a net at fishing supply stores, or make      one from cotton or linen mesh. Use corked plastic bottles      for floats and big fishing sinkers for weights. The poles      can be bought at the lumber yard or found in the      woods.   </p>      <h3>ROUNDING OUT YOUR MEAL</h3>        <p>      EDIBLE SEAWEEDS: Few people consider seaweed when they're      planning dinner, but there are at least six common      varieties that are both nutritious and delicious. Seaweed      has long been appreciated in the Orient and on the islands      of the Pacific . . . and the North American sea scrounge      should also learn to eat the palatable varieties.    </p>    <p>      Look for rockweed clinging to the higher rocks along rough      coastlines. It's great thrown into the pot to steam with      any kind of seafood and contributes a delicate, sweetish      flavor to the finished dish.    </p>    <p>      Tide pools, especially in rocky areas, will provide you      with the other five varieties. The undulating bright green      leaves of sea lettuce make a colorful addition to your      salads if chopped into very small bits while still fresh,      and give you a salty seasoning when dried and powdered.    </p>    <p>      Dulse is a dark red plant with fan or tongue-shaped leaves      and is found attached to rocks, shells and other seaweeds      near the low-water mark. Fresh, the leaves are tough and      rubbery . . . but when dried they become tender,      and-unlike most dried plants-will remain soft      when stored. Use the cured dulse in salads, add it to      chowders and meat loaves or chew it plain-as the      Irish have done for centuriesto take advantage of its      exotic tang.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the best of the seaweeds for cooking is laver. This      tongued or lobed frond with a smooth red, purple or      purplish-brown sheen also grows on rocks, boulders and      pilings near the low-water line. Use it in soups, brown it      in oil seasoned with garlic and ginger root or stuff it as      you would cabbage or grape leaves.    </p>    <p>      Irish moss is the most common of these sea vegetables and      completely carpets the rocky mouths of many tidal pools.      The plant is a very dark olive green, purple or black, 3-6"      high and grows in close, many-branched profusion. Raw, it's      tough . . . dried, it's tougher . . . but boiled, it's      perfectly tender and a wonderful side dish to any seafood      dinner. Usually, though, Irish moss is boiled for 30      minutes and then cooled to give body to soups and to make a      nourishing gelatin.    </p>        <p>      The sixth food-quality seaweed is edible kelp, a 1-10'      long, 3-6" wide olive green or olive brown frond. It can be      distinguished from other kelps by its pronounced mid-rib      and the small, ribless leaves that grow out from its base.      It's these parts that are eaten . . . add the chopped rib      to salads and use the fresh or dried leaves as a vegetable      or in soups, stews and noodle dishes.    </p>    <p>      SEASIDE PLANTS: While you're down at the beach scrounging,      keep an eye out for rose hips, the sweet and vitamin      C-packed fruit of the wild rose. Easily identified as a      rose, the shrubby bush has thorns, saw-tooth-edged oval      leaves and five-petaled mauve or pink flowers. Rose hips      can be eaten just as you pick them, sprinkled with a little      sugar or made into tea, jam or jelly.    </p>    <p>      Orach, or seaside lamb's-quarters, looks almost exactly      like its relative, the common lamb's-quarters or pigweed,      and is just as good in salads or lightly boiled and      buttered. Find orach among the rounded stones above the      water line, sprawled on the ground or growing upright as      high as 5 or 6 feet. Its dark green, scaly-looking leaves      are shaped like arrowheads and will more than take the      place of spinach or chard as a vegetable.    </p>    <p>      The glasswort, which starts off as a patch of small      translucent green shoots and grows into a jointed,      apparently leafless cactus-like plant a few inches high, is      found on clay shores and in salt marshes that are barely      covered by high tides. Another spinach substitute, the      glasswort (or samphire, as it's called by some) is a fine      salad green.    </p>    <p>      Should you come across a collection of fleshy, gray-green      leaves sending up 4-8" spikes of dull greenish flowers,      you've found the goosetongue, a beachcombing version of the      common garden plantain. Goosetongue, which grows along clay      shores over most of the coastline of the U. S. and Canada      and even on the inhospitable-looking rocks of sea bluffs,      can be used in salads or prepared like green beans and      served hot with lots of butter.    </p>        <p>      And if you hanker after a little dessert, gather some beach      plums, a strange relative of the domestic plum and cherry      found on 3-10' high shrubs in the dune sands of the East      and Midwest. The bush is covered with magnificent white      blossoms in the spring and later bears an abundant crop of      red, purple or yellow-orange fruit ranging in size from      one-half to an inch in diameter. The beach plum can be      eaten as picked, made into tart jams and jellies or used in      pies.    </p>    <p>      There are many other edible plants to be found at the      seashore . . . too many to cover here. But there's one      plant the sea scrounge should take care to avoid, because      it's definitely NOT edible: the poison hemlock.    </p>    <p>      If you're tempted to take home a sprig or two of that wild      parsley you found up the hill from the beach, or those wild      carrots (Queen Anne's lace) growing in the field by the Old      Shore Road, be mighty careful. Hemlock is very difficult to      distinguish from either of these plants and a mistake can      be your final undoing. The seeds of the hemlock are deadly      too, and are often confused with caraway, anise and fennel.      It's not really <em>that</em> big a problem (after all, how      many poison hemlock deaths did you hear about last year?)      but forewarned is forearmed.    </p>    <p>      The sea has fed and fascinated people since the beginning      of time and still holds a magical allure for the sailor and      the sportsman. It can hold more than allure for the careful      sea scrounge: the ocean and its shores can be the cheap and      plentiful source of all the delicious food he cares to      gather.    </p>
