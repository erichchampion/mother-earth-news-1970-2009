                <p>      <em>It's a long way from gathering maple sap in      hollowed-out logs and boiling it down outdoors in iron      kettles in 1800 . . . to the monsterous Reverse Osmosis      Concentrator of Maple Sap now being tested by the U.S.      Department of Agriculture. With equipment somewhere in      between these two extremes, a lot of homestead and      medium-to-large commercial operations produce a lot of      maple syrup in this country every year. Commercial setups      generally pump the sap right out of the trees and pipe it      directly into specially-designed refineries these days. . .      but the</em> <em>folks on a number of small homesteads      still earn spending money by gathering maple juice in      buckets and concentrating it over wood fires in homemade      "arches". Sarah Funk is one of those folks and here's how      the Funks do it up in Michigan.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by SARAH FUNK    </h5>            <p>      If you live in the northeastern quarter of this country and      have access to one or more hard maple trees, you've      probably thought about making maple syrup. Well, by all      means, get some equipment and give it a try! Don't let the      fainthearts discourage you with their warnings about      backbreaking labor and long, tedious cooking. Of course      there's some work involved and patience required, but we've      found that good things are worth working for . . . and      sometimes it's that very work which makes good things even      better!    </p>    <p>      There's a joyous sense of accomplishment in producing a      healthful, organic sweetener for your kitchen (one less      item to buy from the supermarket!) and, for sale or barter,      syrup has an advantage over most farm produce: it's not      perishable. We put ours away in the basement and sell most      of it to summer visitors.    </p>    <p>      Whether you plan to make syrup for homestead use only or      hope to sell some for a small income, think the procedure      through both carefully and in advance. Decide how big an      operation you want and secure all necessary equipment      before you begin. Moments are precious once the sap starts      running.    </p>    <p>      If you establish a small commercial venture (as we did),      two main factors will limit the size of your operation: one      is the number of trees available and the other is manpower.    </p>    <p>      Let's consider the trees first. A hard maple, five inches      in diameter, is large enough for one taphole . . . a      smaller tree can be permanently damaged if tapped. <em>(In      THE MAPLE SUGAR BOOK-the definitive work on the      subject-the Nearings say not to tap a tree that is      less than 12 inches thick two feet</em> <em>above ground      level. In addition, Mr. Paul Richards of Chardon, Ohio and      Mr. George Binnig, of Thompson, Ohio-both of whom are      in the maple syrup business-strongly advise against      tapping any tree under 10 inches in diameter and-even      then-prefer waiting until the tree is 12 inches      thick-MOTHER.)</em> A tree twice as large may be      tapped twice, while some old trees are large enough for      three, four or even five tapholes. Don't be tempted to      overtap . . . when in doubt, give the tree a break.    </p>    <p>      The season's yield from each taphole may be roughly      estimated at 20 gallons, although the quality of the sap      declines at the end of the flow and may not be worth      collecting. Remember, of course, that this 20 gallons per      taphole per season is only an approximate figure which will      vary greatly according to location and other factors.    </p>    <p>      Another rule of thumb has it that about 40 gallons of sap      will make one gallon of syrup . . . but the sugar content      of sap is not constant and this figure will also vary.      Combining these two figures, then (with many      qualifications), we arrive at the rough estimate, under      optimum conditions, of one gallon of finished syrup for      every two holes tapped. Optimum conditions are seldom      achieved, however, and we must allow for waste, spillage,      spoilage and accidents. To be realistic, cut the above      estimate in half and plan on one gallon of syrup for every      four tapholes.    </p>    <p>      The other factor to consider in planning your operation is      the number of people who will be available to do the work.      Based on our experience last year (Arthur <em>-</em>      my husband <em>-</em> and I did all the collecting,      cooking and finishing from 150 tapholes), we would suggest      that one person working full-time can handle 100 taps.    </p>    <p>      I'm probably sticking my neck out in making such an      estimate because so much depends on the weather, the      geography of your setup and plain old human nature. But I      do think you'll be on the safe side if you don't undertake      more than 100 tapholes per person during your first      year.    </p>    <h3>BASIC EQUIPMENT</h3>    <p>      Basic equipment for syrup making includes: (1) a brace and      bit, (2) spouts and hooks, (3) collecting buckets and      covers, (4) gathering pails, (5) a collecting tank, (6) a      vehicle if you transport the sap any distance, (7) one or      more holding tanks, (8) a sugarhouse or building where the      sap may be boiled down, (9) the stovelike evaporator or      arch on which the cooking is done, (10) an ample supply of      firewood, (11) a cooking pan, (12) a hydrometer or      thermometer, (13) skimmer, (14) milk can or similar      container for holding the rough boiled syrup, (15) a      finishing pan and stove, (16) felt strainer and (17)      containers for the refined syrup.    </p>    <p>      If the list seems long, don't be discouraged! Most of the      equipment can be improvised or bought secondhand. Run an ad      in the local paper and you may find everything you need      from one source. Here are two maple syrup supply companies      that will be happy to send you their catalogs . . . but by      all means, use them only as a last resort:    </p>    <p>      Sugar Bush Supplies Company<br />Box 1107<br />Lansing, Michigan 48904    </p>    <p>      G.H. Grimm Company, Inc.<br />Rutland, Vermont 05701    </p>    <p>      All containers, spouts, fittings, tanks and buckets which      come into contact with the sap must be of a material      <em>-</em> such as glass, plastic or stainless stee l      <em>-</em> which can be thoroughly cleaned. Metals      which would otherwise rust and contaminate the syrup should      be treated with a lead-free nontoxic paint obtained from a      maple syrup supply house such as the two mentioned above.    </p>    <h3>THE BRACE AND BIT</h3>    <p>      If you don't have a brace and bit for tapping your trees,      you can usually borrow one from anyone who does some      woodworking. Bits from 3/8 to 1/2-inch are used for this      job and I favor the smaller size because it gives a tighter      fit with less chance of leakage on the spouts we use.  </p>      <h3>SPOUTS (SPILES) AND HOOKS</h3>    <p>      Early settlers whittled tapping spouts from wood (some      folks still do) and small boys have fashioned them from tin      can covers . . . but you'll probably be better off buying      than trying to improvise this particular item. As far as I      can ascertain, the manufactured tapping spiles come in only      one size. Each is banded by a metal ring with a hook that      supports the collecting bucket.   </p>      <h3>COLLECTING BUCKETS AND COVERS</h3>     <p>      You'll need one collecting bucket for every taphole      (natcherly) . . . which can run into money. Try contacting      the food processing plants in your area and asking if they      ever discard five-gallon containers of any kind. We found a      canning factory that had discontinued the use of some      square, white, plastic five-gallon cans that were ours for      the taking. I'm not fond of plastic but these buckets cost      us nothing and are light, easy to clean and      rustproof.<br />      Make a small hole in the side of each container, near the      top, and hang the bucket from the hook of one of the      inserted spiles. A bucket this size will <em>usually</em>      hold a day's run of sap but I make no guarantees. On a good      day a good tap in a good tree will produce more than five      gallons. But, since the best syrup is made from the      freshest sap, you'll probably want to empty each collector      can two or three times a day anyway . . . and you'll never      have to worry about overflowing buckets.    </p>    <p>      The collecting containers must be covered to keep out snow,      leaves, dirt and debris. We tried using tinfoil to protect      ours at first, but the idea was a total flop. We finally      devised some satisfactory lids out of scrap lumber by      cutting the wood about two inches larger in each direction      than the top of the bucket On the bottom side of every      cover we nail two strips of wood (if the bucket is square)      or three little blocks (if it's round) to fit just inside      the rim of the bucket and hold the lid in place Then we      cutaway a notch on one side (where the spout will be) to      allow the sap to drip in . . . making sure the notch is      large enough so the sap won't touch wood at any      point.    </p>    <h3>GATHERING PAILS</h3>        <p>      The bought or scavenged dive-gallon containers used for      collector buckets can also be fashioned into gathering      pails by the addition of a bail. These pails are used for      transporting fresh sap from the collector buckets to either      a collector or holding tank and-unless you intend to      sling them from a shoulder yoke-the bails should not      be too long. You may find yourself carrying these pails      through deep snow at times and the task will be much easier      if the containers clear the drifts. Make two pails for each      "tote" person and keep some extras on hand for friends who      drop by to share the fun.     </p>      <h3>THE COLLECTING TANK<br />AND      TRANSPORTING VEHICLE    </h3>    <p>      You won't need a collecting tank if yours is a small,      well-placed sugaring operation where sap can be      hand-carried directly from the tapping buckets to the sugar      shed holding tanks. Few sugar setups are so compact,      however, and most require the hauling of sap in some kind      of receptacle.    </p>        <p>      A collecting tank needn't actually be a tank at all . . .      it can be any sort of container that will hold a day's run      of sap long enough to cart the liquid out of the woods.      I've even heard of one fellow who uses half a dozen milk      cans tied to his tractor.    </p>    <p>      The kind of container you come up with will depend on your      method of transportation. We'd love to haul our sap out of      the forest in a special sleigh behind a team of horses . .      . but we've settled for a less romantic means of      transportation. We use a four-wheel-drive truck with a      200-gallon tank on the back into which we bucket our maple      juice. A tractor or jeep pulling a sled, wagon or trailer      loaded with drums, tanks or five-gallon cans are other      possibilities as long as they can get through the snow and      slush.    </p>    <p>      Whatever your vehicle, make sure the collecting tank or      tanks are securely fastened and covered. Roads in the woods      are bound to be rough, there may even be inclines and a      great deal of sap-unless precautions are      taken-can splash out and be lost.    </p>      <h3>THE HOLDING TANKS</h3>    <p>      As fresh maple sap is collected, it must be stored in a      holding tank or tanks until you have enough juice on hand      to make boiling it worthwhile. The number of these tanks      that you'll need depends on their capacity and the size of      your sugaring operation. Our storage tank (a twin to the      collecting tank we use) holds 200 gallons, which is barely      adequate, and we hope to add a second holding tank of the      same size this year.    </p>    <p>      By the way, our tanks were originally used by local cherry      growers-for transporting fruit. We got them for very      little and I think similar containers are used by cherry      growers in other parts of the country. Ask around and you      may find a bargain tank or two yourself.    </p>        <p>      Place your storage tank adjacent to an outside wall of the      sugarhouse as close as possible to the inlet on the cooking      pan and on a platform that supports the base of the tank      level with the base of the pan. Make an outlet in the      bottom of the holding tank and fit it with a pipe      connection that extends through the sugarhouse wall and      into the inlet on the side of the cooking pan. If the pan      doesn't have an inlet hole in its side, raise the tank a      little higher and extend the feeder pipe over the pan. The      feeder pipe must have a shut-off valve through which the      flow of sap from the tank to the pan can be regulated. If      there are two tanks, hook the second to the first with a      separate shut-off valve between the storage vats.   </p>      <h3>THE SUGARHOUSE</h3>     <p>      Location of the sugarhouse is a strategic matter, whether      you build one from scratch or decide to utilize an existing      building. First, consider the matter of proximity. If the      sugarhouse is in or near the woodlot, it's close to both      the sap and the firewood supply. However, since the boiling      down-or cooking-of maple sap is a      time-consuming process, some folks prefer to locate the      sugar shed near a barn, garage or other building where they      can carry on a second chore while "keeping an eye" on the      cooking.    </p>    <p>      Next, because syrup time precisely coincides with "high      water" time, think about access to your sugar shanty during      muddy weather. Melting snow and spring showers will turn a      seemingly solid piece of ground into an impassable morass.      If you can't locate the boiling house on high ground, at      least try for a spot that's reasonably well drained.    </p>    <p>      If you're blessed with a small knoll in a favorable spot,      on the other hand (or have the means to create one), build      your sugarhouse close by and set up a simple gravity-feed      system from the collecting tank into the storage area. Your      truck or other vehicle can be driven onto the knoll and, by      means of a simple connection, the sap transferred from the      collecting tank to the storage tank without pumping or      bucketing.    </p>    <p>      Finally, consider the availability of water and electricity      to the sugar shed. Though neither, facility is absolutely      essential, they both can come in handy. If I had to select      only one, I'd choose water because it's such a convenience      to be able to wash the sugaring equipment without carrying      it to another building. A ready supply of water is also a      godsend in case of fire or other emergency (more about this      later).    </p>    <p>      Electricity is necessary only if you're ambitious enough to      plan on boiling sugar a lot after dark. Remember, if you do      wire the cooking house, that the building will be filled      with steam which can easily cause a short. Don't mount a      light bulb directly over the pan.    </p>    <p>      The sugarhouse itself is basically only a shelter from the      weather and needn't be elaborate. Ideally, it'll be large      enough to house the arch, a supply of firewood      and-during the offseason-all the buckets and      other equipment. A concrete floor is handy as it furnishes      a ready-made foundation for the evaporator.    </p>    <p>      Don't forget to make provisions for the steam to escape!      Vents near the top of the building-such as the wide      cracks between the upper wall boards on our      sugarhouse-will let moist air out without allowing      cold gusts to blow across and cool the boiling      sap.    </p>    <h3>THE ARCH</h3>    <p>      The arch, or evaporator, is the stovelike structure which      supports the cooking pan and encloses the fire. Many      commercial producers use gas-fired arches nowadays, but we      have a lot of wood available and (after cooking on a wood      range) we feel that a wood-fired evaporator produces sap      with a superior flavor.    </p>    <p>      Prefabbed and assembled metal arches are widely used by      modern commercial maple syrup refiners but you can still      build a do-it-yourself arch out of any fireproof material      on hand: brick, stone, cement block, monolithic concrete      poured in forms or whatever. just remember that the top of      the arch should fit the pan exactly in order to avoid      unnecessary heat loss. Your evaporator is "efficient" if      the sugarhouse doesn't get very warm while you're boiling      sap. This means that all the heat is going where it's      supposed to!    </p>    <p>      The building we chose as our sugar shed had a brick chimney      which we rebuilt and attached our arch to. If you don't      have a chimney and aren't up to building one, a metal      stovepipe will do . . . if it's large (12 to 14 inches in      diameter), runs straight up with no elbows and has a      protective cap on top to keep out rain and birds.    </p>    <p>      Because of the wide variety of materials from which an      evaporator may be built, and because I'm not a skilled      stonemason, I won't attempt to give detailed instructions      for building an arch. Use your ingenuity, your library and      your friends to find out how to work with what you have.      When in doubt, stay simple.    </p>    <p>      Actually, the project isn't that difficult. Arthur, my      husband, had only a sketchy background in concrete work and      I had none at all when we began our arch      and-together-we built a fine, workable one.      Based on that experience, I feel qualified to offer the      following pointers:    </p>    <p>      (1) If your sugar shed doesn't have a concrete floor, begin      construction of the arch by pouring a concrete footing for      it.    </p>    <p>      (2) Be sure you get the right type of sand-with rough      and not "round" grains-when you mix your own cement.      If the proper sand-is not available, buy the more      expensive redi-mix concrete. When you're going to the      trouble of building an arch, you might as well use      materials that'll last.    </p>    <p>      (3) For greatest boiling efficiency, the syrup pan doesn't      sit on top of the arch, it is the top of the arch and the      walls of the evaporator are built up around it. To assure a      proper pan-arch mating, center the pan on the arch and      build a two-inch-high wall of bricks, stone or concrete      around it. Leave spaces in the wall for the pan's inlet and      outlet so that the container can be filled or drained while      in position.<br />      (4) Before you begin construction of the evaporator, mark      out its dimensions on the floor or footing you've built. If      you already have a pan, the length and width of the      container will determine the size of the evaporator (the      pan sits down in the top of this specialized stove so the      outside dimensions of a stone or concrete evaporator built      straight up from the floor will equal the length or width      of the pan plus the desired thickness of the retaining      walls around it).    </p>    <p>      (5) The evaporator needn't be very high. Ours measures 3      1/2 feet, which is just ample for a roaring fire under the      pan. Do remember that the cooking pan does fit right down      into the top of the sugar stove and each inside dimension      of the opening in the top of the arch <em>under the      pan</em> should be about four inches less than the      corresponding dimension of the pan itself.    </p>    <p>      (6) The firepit should occupy only half the space enclosed      by the arch. Fill the remaining area (toward the chimney)      with dirt, rocks or rubble to within three inches of the      bottom of the pan. This makes for more efficient use of      heat.    </p>    <p>      (7) Line the bottom and the sides of the firepit with      bricks made of fire clay instead of regular concrete. Such      bricks are expensive, but they'll prevent the outer      structure from eventually cracking from the heat.    </p>    <p>      (8) The front or end of the evaporator opposite the chimney      needs a firedoor large enough to admit sizable logs. If you      aren't fortunate enough to find such a door in a junkyard,      fashion one from a suitable piece of metal and hang it from      rings mounted in the concrete.    </p>    <p>      (9) If you can find some angle iron, use it to make a frame      about 3/8-inch larger all around than the boiling pan (to      allow for the pan's expansion) and grout the frame into the      top of the stove. The angle iron will protect the concrete      from wear over the years as the pan is inserted and      removed.<br />      (10) Orthodox operations insist that the cooking pan must      sit level. We, however, allow the outlet corner of the flat      container to be just one inch lower than the pan's opposite      corner. This helps the receptacle to drain.<br />      (11) Work slowly and thoughtfully, checking the work with a      level as you proceed. A lot of time and energy can be      wasted tearing down a thoughtless mistake.<br />      (12) Concrete will not cure properly if the temperature      goes below freezing during the first 24 hours after it's      poured. In any case, if at all possible, allow your new      evaporator to "set" two weeks before you use it.    </p>         <h3>FIREWOOD</h3>    <p>            Firewood to fuel the arch is frequently available for the      cutting and hauling. Lots of people (here in Michigan,      anyway) have dead elm trees on their property that they're      glad to get rid of. Sawmills frequently give away slab wood      and hundreds of trees are cut every day and never used on      land "developments" and the right-of-ways for roads and      power lines. You'll soon find, given your choice, that dead      elm is adequate but apple burns longer and beech and maple      hotter.    </p>    <p>      Cut the firewood into lengths that'll fit the firepit of      your arch (logs larger than seven inches in diameter      usually must be split to burn well) and stack      it-under cover if possible-where it will be      handy for the boiling. If your sugarhouse is big enough,      you can even store the wood right inside . . . but the      ventilation must be adequate, in that case, or the steam      from cooking might well make the unused fuel too wet to      burn.   </p>      <h3>THE PAN</h3>     <p>      If at all possible, secure your syrup-boiling pan first and      build the arch to fit it . . . or, if your evaporator is      already con structed, find a competent sheetmetal man and      have him make a pan that exactly fits the arch. You can      estimate the capacity in gallons of a given pan by      multiplying its length times width times depth (in inches)      and dividing by 230 (cubic inches per gallon).    </p>    <p>      Should you acquire, as we did, a pan that has been      previously used for syrup making, you may find that a      whitish tartar residue has built up on the inside of the      container. Don't be dismayed. This is a natural by-product      of the boiling and does no harm. If a pan looks badly      scorched, though, don't buy it because no amount of      scrubbing will make it clean enough to produce a really      high-grade syrup. Don't start with someone else's problems.    </p>    <p>      Our pan is baffled (see diagram). A baffled pan is not      absolutely necessary for cooking syrup, but it does do a      better job than a plain flat pan. The built-in guides, you      see, divide the pan lengthwise into compartments which are      not entirely separated but which feed into each other      through small apertures (letters C, D and E in our example)      at the ends of the baffles. The sap goes into the first      compartment at point A and, as the solution cooks down and      more sap is added, the concentrated solution progressively      moves into compartments 2, 3 and 4. This results in an      ever-increasingly concentrated solution which is, finally,      withdrawn at point E.    </p>    <p>      The boiling pan's inlet and outlet are situated on opposite      sides of the end of the container which sits away from the      chimney. The inlet can be either an opening into the pan or      simply a pipe which extends over the edge of the      receptacle. The outlet is an opening in the side of the      container near the bottom of the fourth compartment. Make      them both of standard plumbing fixtures equipped with      shut-off valves. Be sure to wash these fixtures in hot      soapy water and scrub them inside with a bottle brush, both      before and after use.    </p>        <h3>HYDROMETER OR THERMOMETER</h3>    <p>      To guide you as you cook the sap, you'll need either a      hydrometer (which measures the density of liquids) or a      thermo meter (which measures temperature). Used properly,      either will tell you how thick the bubbling liquid has      become. Commercial operators refer to a special syrup      thermometer which is easy to read at the crucial      temperatures . . . but we manage to get by with an ordinary      candy thermometer and I'm sure you can too.   </p>      <h3>A SKIMMER</h3>     <p>      As the syrup cooks, a foam will form on its surface. This      foam should be skimmed off. Make yourself a skimmer from a      piece of screen wire approximately three by four inches.      Place this screening in a metal frame to keep it rigid and      attach it to a wooden handle long enough to reach across      the width of the pan.    </p>      <h3>THE MILK CAN</h3>     <p>      When the syrup is about half done and ready for finishing      it's very convenient to draw the liquid off into a clean      milk can or any similar container of 5 or 10-gallon      capacity.    </p>      <h3>FINISHING PAN AND STOVE</h3>     <p>      Unless you're going big scale, the kitchen stove will      probably suffice for "finishing" or the final cooking down      of the syrup. A metal washtub (as long as it isn't rusty)      can be scrubbed out to serve as a finishing pan. Last year,      we finished in a washtub on the wood range, which was      satisfying and rustic. But we're aiming for a little more      control this year by building a stainless steel pan to fit      on our kerosene stove.   </p>      <h3>FELT STRAINER</h3>     <p>      The finished syrup must be strained through a heavy felt      bag to remove the residue called sugar "sand" or "niter".      These bags can be purchased from supply houses or made at      home from heavy felt. Each is a pouch about 12 inches long      and 7 inches wide at the top which tapers to a somewhat      narrower bottom. Wash the bags between uses and don't store      them near moth balls.    </p>     <h3>CONTAINERS FOR BOTTLING</h3>     <p>      Maple syrup may be bottled in glass, metal or plastic.      Mason jars are excellent for home use, but are an      extravagance if you plan to sell syrup in them. Perhaps you      can take orders from your potential customers and ask them      to supply their own containers. You might also check out      your neighbors or local recycling operations for usable      glass jars. As a last resort, try restaurants where you can      probably get gallon containers but-be      forewarned-they're almost sure to be plastic. If you      can get rid of the smell of pickles or mayonnaise and if      you can find a way to create an air-tight seal, you can use      such jars . . . but only if.</p>    <h3>GETTIN' READY</h3>     <p>      You should have all this equipment on hand and ready to use      by the middle of March. Wash the buckets and spigots in hot      soapy water and rinse them well. Scrub and thoroughly rinse      the pan and tanks, too . . . then wait for the weather to      break. Warm days and cold nights will start the sap on its      journey up the tree trunks. If there's a maple tree near      your house, make an experimental taphole and watch until      you see liquid oozing. That's your signal to get busy      tapping.    </p>      <h3>TAPPING</h3>     <p>      I've heard of people tapping all kinds of maples and even      non-maples . . . but for best results, we stick to the hard      maple trees. They differ from the soft maple by having a      darker, rougher bark. If in doubt about a tree, look up at      its branches . . . the limbs of the soft maple are light      gray and much smoother than those of the hard maple.    </p>    <p>      There are two advantages to tapping a tree on its south      side: (1) such a tap sometimes yields more sap and (2) the      sun will melt any ice that freezes in a south-facing spout.    </p>    <p>      Try to line the tapholes up with the main "arteries" of the      tree, above large roots or below large limbs. Make each      hole at whatever height feels comfortable and, before      drilling, use a hatchet or knife to smooth off an area on      the trunk for the bucket to hang against.    </p>    <p>      The sap flow is concentrated in the outer two inches of the      tree (not including the bark) so there's no need to drill      deeply. Put a scratch or a piece of tape about two inches      from the end of your bit. Using this as a guide, you'll      drill through the bark and into the wood about one inch,      which is far enough. <em>(In</em> <em>THE MAPLE SUGAR BOOK,      mention is made of a man in the maple syrup business who      has drilled up to six inches deep, though the Nearings      themselves tap only one or two inches deep.      -MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Next, slip the spout through its ring and into the taphole.      The spile should slide in easily at first. Then, as it      widens, the spout will need a gentle tap with a hammer to      firm it into place. Handle the spout carefully and don't      pound it out of shape. When it's firmly in position, hang a      bucket on the hook and add the protective cover (making      sure it doesn't touch the spout at any point).   </p>    <h3>COLLECTING AND STORING</h3>    <p>      Don't expect the sap to run on schedule. Some days there      won't be enough to collect and other days the buckets may      overflow. The fluid runs mainly in the daytime so the late      afternoon is a good time to collect the day's flow.    </p>    <p>      You will sometimes find frozen sap in the collecting      buckets. If there's just a layer of ice lift it off and      discard it, since the ice is mostly water and the sugar      will be left in the unfrozen sap. If the entire contents      are solidified, you might as well discard it and start over      because it's just too awkward to try to handle the big      chunks of ice.    </p>    <p>      Transfer the collected sap to your holding tank or tanks      but, before doing so, make absolutely sure that the      shut-off valve leading from the tanks to the pan is closed.      Otherwise, without realizing what's going on in the      sugarhouse, you could easily fill the pan to overflowing.    </p>    <p>      For a different kind of treat later in the year, set aside      a gallon or two of the fresh maple juice as you're      transferring it to your storage tanks. Take the sap you've      saved into the kitchen, heat it to 160°F, pour the      juice into sterilized jars and seal them. Put the jars away      in your basement or root cellar until a hot summer day . .      . then try them as a light and refreshing drink!    </p>    <p>      Don't plan to store the main body of your sap in the      holding tanks for more than three or four days because the      raw liquid does spoil. This spoilage is the result of      microbial growth which results in an easily recognizable      sour taste. Discard all spoiled or fermented sap. .Don't      try to save it. Even a small amount in a batch of      otherwise-good syrup will affect its flavor and color.    </p>    <p>      Commercial growers store their sap in large underground      tanks lit with blacklight to inhibit these bacteria but the      best a small operator can do is (1) keep his sap cool to      slow down the microorganisms, (2) keep his holding tanks      covered to prevent outside contamination and (3) boil the      sap as soon as possible after collecting it.    </p>    <h3>COOKING</h3>    <p>      Here comes the tricky part: reducing 40 gallons of sap to a      single gallon of silky smooth, clear syrup. You simply      can't be too careful while "boiling down", especially in      the beginning when you're learning exactly how your arch      and pan will work together.    </p>        <p>      A pan full of cold sap takes a long time to heat up, even      over a roaring fire. After the juice begins to boil, it      still may be an hour or two before there's a noticeable      reduction in the volume of the sap. At this point, things      seem to be moving very slowly and you may get tired of      checking the pan so frequently when nothing seems to be      happening.<br />      Don't get careless! After the sap concentrates to a certain      density things happen very quickly, and you may easily      leave the sugarhouse for what seems to be only a few      minutes and return to find a sticky burnt mass bubbling on      the bottom of the pan. If this happens, you may want to      salvage the syrup for yourself, but don't try to "improve"      it by mixing it with more sap. Empty the pan, clean it out      and start over with all kinds of firm resolve to do better      next time. Above all, don't get angry at yourself or anyone      else involved . . . it's all part of the game.    </p>    <p>      Do take every possible precaution against burning the syrup      . . . even a slight scorching will taint its flavor and can      wipe out several days' work. I'm not saying that      <em>you</em> can't use the scorched product, but it      definitely won't be up to standard for selling . . . and,      if you're not careful, you may find yourself with an      overstock of a smoky-looking liquid labeled "home use".    </p>    <p>      Guard against this accidental burning by establishing a      "danger line" depth in the pan (ours is two inches). When      the bubbling syrup solution boils down to the mark, add      more sap from the holding tank (keep a reserve in the      storage vat for just this purpose). If you ever      miscalculate and suddenly find you have no sap on hand with      which to dilute a panful of syrup that's in danger of      burning, quickly thin the boiling solution with water. It's      much more effective to dilute an endangered batch of syrup      with water than to try to bank and diminish the fire.    </p>    <p>      Since wood fires are not easy to control, we found that we      had to start letting ours die down about three hours before      we intended to quit cooking for the day. We only boil sap      during the day, and we try to cook the syrup down halfway      in the large pan . . . that is, for every 20 gallons of sap      run into the pan (rough estimate), we expect to take off      one gallon for finishing. This rough-boiled syrup is then      taken to the house and cooked down by half again to make      syrup of the finished 40 to 1 ratio.<br />      We soon noticed, as we drained off the half-cooked syrup      that a quantity of the sticky liquid stayed in the      sugarhouse boiling pan. Reluctant to waste this "gold", we      at first left it in the pan until the next time we cooked.      That approach didn't last long! We quickly learned that a      fire which looks black and cold in the evening can spring      to life during the night and bun such leftover sap to a      sticky mess by morning.    </p>    <p>      After one such experience, we put a plastic sheet over the      pan at night. Then if the sap started cooking, the steam      collected on the plastic and dropped harmlessly back to      dilute-and thus protect-the syrup once again.      Eventually, though, we dispensed with that idea and now we      just empty the pan completely at the end of each day. We      aren't always sure when we'll cook again and we prefer to      start afresh each time.    </p>    <p>      Every cooking operation will be different, and the general      guides I've given here are just pointers to help you in      setting up yours. Boiling syrup is a process that has its      own rhythm . . you can't rush it or force it, but only      discover and work with it. Above all, approach the task      with love and don't be discouraged.   </p>      <h3>FINISHING</h3>     <p>      Finishing is a delicate process and must be watched      carefully. How do you know when the syrup is done? For your      owe use, you can just boil the sweetener to taste . . . but      if you plan to sell some, the maple syrup should weigh 11      pounds per gallon.    </p>    <p>      Your syrup will have reached that density when it boils at      a Fahrenheit temperature seven degrees above the boiling      temperature of water. That is, both water and sap      boil-at sea level-at 212°F. As sap is      concentrated into syrup, however, its boiling point is      raised by its increasing sugar content. The sweetener is      considered finished (and will weigh 11 pounds a gallon)      when the concentrating sugar has raised the syrup's boiling      point seven Fahrenheit degrees. At sea level, then, when      maple syrup boils at 219°F (212 + 7) . . . it is      finished, standardized syrup.    </p>    <p>      Bear in mind, though, that water does not always boil at      212°F. In general, its boiling point is lowered by one      degree for every 550 feet that it is elevated above sea      level. So, to finish maple syrup properly, you must first      determine the boiling point for water on your own stove . .      . and then add seven degrees to that figure. If you live at      an elevation of 1100 feet, for example, water should boil      on your stove at a temperature of 210°F . . . which      means that your syrup will be finished when. it boils at      217°F (210 + 7).   </p>      <h3>STRAINING</h3>    <p>      Strain the finished syrup through a heavy felt bag while      the liquid is still hot. The process will go a little      faster if you have two of the bags. At that, hang the felt      sacks over a flat pan and be patient. . . the sticky      sweetener will run through quite slowly. If the syrup stops      dripping, it's either too cold or the bags have filled with      sugar sand and need to be cleaned. . .   </p>    <h3>BOTTLING</h3>     <p>      Maple syrup will keep indefinitely if packed properly. When      bottling yours, be especially careful to (1) heat the      liquid to 160°F (2) sterilize all containers and      utensils by immersion in boiling water or-in the case      of plastic-by cleansing in a hot solution of 1/4-cup      Clorox to one quart water and rinsing hi previously boiled      water and (3) seal all containers of syrup airtight. When      the sweetener is stored in tin or plastic receptacles;      squeeze the containers until they just overflow (to force      out all air). The syrup will contract (creating a vacuum)      as it cools.    </p>        <p>      We put our syrup up in recycled glass containers. These are      now getting scarce in large sizes and we may be forced to      use some plastic this year. Of course, commercial      containers are available and you may want to try them. For      our purposes, we saw no reason to invest money in such      bottles and jars . . . money which would have to be added      to the selling price of the product. You may find, as we      did, that customers appreciate a "home grown" look and the      savings that go with it.   </p>      <h3>SELLING</h3>     <p>      Before selling syrup, check with your county agent to find      out what-if any-regulations are imposed by your      state or local authorities. When I inquired, I was referred      to the Foods and Standards Division of the Department of      Agriculture . . . so I wrote the agency a letter, stating      that I wanted to sell syrup and asking about regulations.    </p>    <p>      Some time later, a young man in a suit came to the farm,      told me he was from the Foods and Standards Division and      asked to see our sugarhouse. With some trepidation I led      him across the flooded barnyard to our sugar shed with its      plastic on the windows, cracked concrete floor and a lack      of both water and electricity.    </p>    <p>      "Looks all right to me," he said. "When you start making      syrup just sweep the floor, knock down the birds' nests      and, well, just keep things clean." The young man in a suit      handed me some instruction sheets (which proved to be very      useful), smiled and departed. The pages informed me that a      gallon of syrup should weigh 11 pounds, should be clean and      free from fermentation and free from damage caused by      scorching, buddiness, objectionable flavor or odor.    </p>    <p>      That's all pretty clear except for the word "buddiness" . .      . which is a flavor change that occurs at the end of the      season when the sap is of too poor a quality to make good      syrup. When the finished product starts tasting "buddy",      it's time to wrap up the operation and get on with other      spring projects.    </p>    <p>      Your syrup will probably sell itself if you let the word      get around that it's available. Keep the prices competitive      and sell only your best quality stuff. In our area, syrup      is priced at $7.00 per gallon in the stores, so we charge      $6.00 per gallon . . . which gives both the customer and      ourselves a break. If you can, get an idea ahead of time as      to how people will prefer to buy . . . in pints, quarts or      gallons. Surprisingly, most of ours sells in gallon      quantities but it may go differently in your area.    </p>    <p>      Consider your first year at syrup making a learning      experience and don't plan to clear a whole lot of money on      the operation. Even if the returns from your initial season      are only enough to pay for your equipment, you should still      be able to swing into action the following year at hardly      any additional expense.    </p>    <h3>      COOK WITH IT    </h3>    <p>      It's almost superfluous to tell anyone how to use maple      syrup. The natural sweetener can be poured over pancakes,      cornbread, yogurt or a dish of fruit. It's also great with      baked beans and sweet potatoes or you can stir a spoonful      into hot milk for a breakfast drink.    </p>    <p>      Maple syrup may be substituted for sugar in any recipe by      using one cup of syrup for 1/2-cup of sugar and reducing      the liquid in the recipe by 1/4-cup. We've found that      cookies made with syrup tend to mold if they're stored for      very long but-for sweet breads and cakes (which don't      last long anyway)-we've found maple syrup to be      unsurpassed. Here are a couple of our favorite recipes:    </p>    <h3>MAPLE SYRUP GINGERBREAD</h3>    <p>      1 cup maple syrup<br />      1 cup sour milk (or sour cream or yogurt)<br />      1 egg, beaten<br />      4 tablespoons vegetable oil<br />      2 1/4cups flour (we use whole wheat)<br />      1 3/4 teaspoons baking soda<br />      1 1/2 teaspoons ginger<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />    </p>    <p>      Blend the syrup, milk, oil and egg together. Add the dry      ingredients and stir into a liquid, beating well. Then,      pour the liquid into a greased cake pan and bake it in your      oven at 350° F for 30 to 40 minutes.    </p>    <h3>MAPLE CANDY</h3>    <p>      If you'd like to try some maple candy, here's a recipe that      Arthur put together himself. You may want to cut the batch      in half.    </p>    <p>      1 gallon maple syrup<br />      1 cup sweet cream<br />      1/4 pound butter<br />      nuts (optional)<br />    </p>    <p>      Boil the syrup until it reaches 220° F. Then add the      cream and butter. Stir them in well and continue cooking,      stirring frequently, until the candy reaches the softball      stage. Remove the pan from the fire, set it in cold water      and stir until the mixture starts to thicken. Then add the      nuts and pour the candy into a buttered dish to cool.    </p>    <p>      My mother has suggested that the candy will be creamier if      it's allowed to cool undisturbed at 210°F. but we      haven't tried this so we don't know for sure if the idea      works.    </p>    <p>      Maple candy is so good you may not be able to keep the      family from devouring it all immediately . . . but if you      want to try to sell some, plan on making about five pounds      from each gallon of syrup. If you were to sell this at      $1.50 per pound (which is what we've charged), the total      return would be $7.50. Considering the butter, cream and      nuts that were added, this doesn't really give any      increased return over selling just the plain syrup. Guess      we'd better raise our per-pound price to $1.75 or $2.00!    </p>
