                    <h5 id="byline">      by James E. Churchill    </h5>        <p>      March, in Wisconsin,can be a beauty or a beast. It can be a      time for picking tender greens from the sunny side of field      knolls or it can be a time for spending the best part of      the day shoveling through deep snow. One thing is      practically certain, however . . . March is the time for      sap to run in the maple trees.    </p>    <p>      The equipment required for turning this sap into maple      syrup - good eatin' anytime - is very simple.      All we really need is a brace and bit, a few elderberry      stems, a whittling or paring knife, some lightweight pails      and a few nails.    </p>    <p>      Our bit should drill a hole about 1/2-inch in diameter and      the pails should each hold at least two gallons. Nails 10 d      or larger will suffice for hanging the buckets on the maple      trees and the elderberry stems (for spiles) should be green      wood and not so much larger than the bit that they can't be      quickly shaved to fit the holes we drill. We'll need a fire      for boiling off the sap, of course, and I use the barrel      stove in my garage for this purpose.    </p>    <p>      There's a little trick to making sap spiles out of      elderberry stems and, although I covered the technique in      MOTHER N0. 11, I'll outline it again here.    </p>    <p>      First, find a patch of elderberries <em>(Sambucus      Canadensis)</em> -maybe the same patch you harvested      berries or blossoms from last year-and saw off enough      stems (1/2 inch or larger in diameter) to allow four inches      of length for each spile. Trim off the branches, saw the      stems into four inch lengths and force the white center out      of each piece. This center is a soft pithy material and it      can be pushed out with the right sized rod. It can also be      burned out.    </p>    <p>      Use a wire about the same size as a coat hanger and heated      red-hot to burn the soft core from a spile by picking up      the four-inch length of stem and inserting the hot      wire-gingerly-into one end. Smoke will rise and      you'll feel little resistance as you push the wire      completely through the spile. If it pushes hard, remove the      wire, re-heat it and try again.    </p>    <p>      Burn out the centers of all the sections of elderberry stem      this way. Then take your pocket knife and, near the end of      the spile that will be inserted in the tree, shave away a      flat surface-at an angle-until the center hole      is visible. The spile will be inserted flat-surface-side-up      and will help to guide the sap into the bucket. If you      don't have any elderberries in your area, use metal tubing.      I'm told that bush dwellers in some areas make a tube of      rolled-up birch bark and cut the holes in the trees with a      knife.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, when I have the necessary equipment together      to start tapping, I go out into the woods to a stand of six      large maples that I know. Each tree stands about one foot      in diameter-large enough to be tapped twice, with one      spile on each side of the trunk-and yields from 15 to      30 gallons of sap in a good year.    </p>    <p>      To do the actual tapping I drill a hole into the tree about      chest high. The hole should be deep enough to go through      the bark and into the sap wood-about three inches      total-and should be drilled slanting slightly upward      so that the sap will run down and out.    </p>    <p>      The next step is to insert the spile-which may have      to be trimmed to fit-into the hole. The fit must be      tight to be effective.    </p>        <p>      Now, you <em>can</em> notch the spile and hang your bucket      directly on it but I've found that this method is subject      to accidents . . . so I drive a nail above the spile and      through one corner of a piece of building paper. I then      hang the bucket from the nail and the building paper forms      a roof over the pail so that rainwater, pieces of bark and      other foreign matter-which greatly reduce the quality      of the sap-can't get into the container. Sap is only      3% sugar anyway, and if you dilute that with rainwater you      have a lot of work ahead of you just getting the sap boiled      down. Foreign matter in the syrup will sometimes give it an      off flavor, too.    </p>    <p>      Maple syrup producers in Wisconsin now almost exclusively      use heavy plastic bags for collecting sap. These bags are      sealed around the spite in the trunk for the same reason      that I put the building paper roof over my buckets. A food      forager could likewise use a plastic bag if he had one and      if he didn't have any prejudices against that material. My      philosophy regarding plastic, though, is that I'll use it      if I'm recycling it. I like to think this is turning the      enemy back on himself. I won't, however, become dependent      on it.    </p>    <p>      I dump my sap buckets twice a day and try to boil down the      sap every day. This boiling down is best done in a large      flat pan, can be a very lengthy process and is complete      only when the sap is thick and sweet enough to please your      palate.    </p>    <p>      If you want your syrup to be of the same consistency as is      generally sold, you'll have to boil it until the      temperature rises to seven degrees above the initial      boiling point of the liquid. This, of course, will vary      somewhat, depending on your elevation above sea level.      Here, water boils at 209°F. Therefore, syrup is made at      216°F.    </p>    <p>      When boiling down maple syrup be very careful not to get it      <em>too</em> hot and scorch it or it'll be kinda'      strong-flavored.    </p>    <p>      Scorching is especially a problem during the final few      minutes of the change from syrup into sugar.    </p>    <p>      If you continue to boil your sap after it has reached the      syrup stage, it will eventually granulate into soft sugar.      You'll know when that happens because a little sap taken      from the kettle and cooled will crunch between the teeth.      When it hits this stage, I remove the sap and stir it      constantly until it's cool. This results in a creamy soft      sugar that can be spread like butter or spooned onto      breakfast cereal.    </p>    <p>      Hard sugar is made by further cooking the syrup to the      sugaring stage . . . which is generally designated as      234°F. When you have your sap heated to this      temperature, pour it into molds to cool. The sugar will      harden into the shape of the mold and can thus be formed      into animals, plants or other objects which find a ready      market (especially during the holiday season).    </p>    <p>      Once made, both maple syrup and sugar can be used for many      delicious recipes and either one should be more healthful      and less harmful to the body than white sugar. I've read      that some of the missionaries and early settlers sustained      themselves very well on a diet of just maple syrup and corn      meal. There are also accounts of Indians living on maple      sugar for days at a time and other reports of how Indian      families in this part of the country made large quantities      of sugar and-since they used no salt at      all-sprinkled it on their meat. This was probably      more healthful than our current inclination to salt      everything.    </p>    <p>      I use maple syrup to cover wheat cakes in the morning, put      it on my whole wheat bread and-whenever I have      it-substitute it for white sugar. It also makes a      mighty good syrup for canning fruit. No one has really      appreciated maple syrup or maple sugar, however, until      they've poured or sprinkled it over wild rice on a cold      winter morning with the snow piled deep around the cabin      and the wood stove radiating a gentle heat.    </p>    <p>      Get your chops into this delicious little treat by      sprinkling a cup of wild rice into three cups of lightly      salted boiling water and boiling for 45 minutes or until      the rice is tender . . . then serve it with milk, maple      syrup or maple sugar. (I covered wild rice gathering and      processing in MOTHER NO. 6).    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind that it isn't absolutely necessary to tap      sugar maples to make sweet syrup. Gibbons tells about      tapping all the varieties of maple-even the      sycamore-and Angier says that the Bushmen along the      Peace River tapped birch trees for the syrup they made.    </p>    <p>      If I lived where there were no sugar maples I would      certainly experiment with whatever large deciduous trees      were in my area. You should also be aware that there are      trees that can be tapped for syrup in the Mid-South too . .      . it's not exclusively a product of the North.    </p>    <p>      I personally think the art of sugar-making could be      expanded to a much greater degree than it is . . .      especially in back country areas.    </p>    <p>      Folks who do live in a sugar maple region shouldn't      overlook the possibility that they can make some extra      "bread" from the trees on their homestead. A good-sized      maple may yield a gallon of finished syrup which will find      a ready market at a price of $15. Concentrated further into      sugar, the products of the maple tree are also readily      saleable and are very easy to both store and transport to      distant markets.    </p>    <p>      Maple syrup cooperatives, each of which is really a central      evaporating station for boiling down the syrup, are      operating in some areas. Producers tap the trees, put their      sap in special containers and bring it to the evaporators.      The sap is purchased there after being tested for sugar      content and the producer gets paid everytime he brings in a      load. Since money can be scarce on a homestead this time of      year, many back-to-the-land people should welcome such an      arrangement.    </p>    <p>      By the way, there's a good book for any of you folks who do      want to learn the maple syrup business. It's Helen and      Scott Nearing's, <em>THE MAPLE SUGAR STORY,</em> which I'm      glad to see listed on MOTHER'S BOOKSHELF. This is the book,      back in '58 or '59, that started me thinking of a way out      of the system.    </p>    <p>      Just about the time that maple sugaring winds down for the      season, many green plants will start to send their      succulent stems up through the ground . . . which is very      handy for the food forager who's probably getting a little      tired of winter meat and sprouts. One of the best of these      plants is prickly lettuce ( <em>Lactuca Scariola</em> ).    </p>    <p>      Some botanists say that domestic lettuce was derived from      the prickly lettuce . . . and well it might have been since      "tame" lettuce resembles wild lettuce in about the same way      a domestic fruit resembles its wild counterpart. Our      domestic lettuce is a pale, mild, insipid character which      can't stand competition and must be tended with great care.      Prickly lettuce on the other hand, is often seen elbowing      its way up through strong weeds such as burdock and      thistles. It isn't discouraged by trees either, and I've      seen it growing many times in rich woods . . . especially      under oaks and hickories.    </p>    <p>      Prickly lettuce shoots appear in our area early in April.      The slightly yellowish leaves look and taste like tame      lettuce when very small but later, as the plant matures, it      grows from a leaf-clasped stalk to a height of three or      more feet.    </p>    <p>      In its early stage prickly lettuce looks like a thistle,      especially since its yellow flowers resemble the blossoms      of some Canadian thistles. Close inspection of the plants      will dispel any confusion, however, because the Canadian      thistle has sharp stabbing thorns while the thorns of wild      lettuce are only a mild rasp.    </p>    <p>      Prickly lettuce can be used in many different ways : . . in      mixed salad, with toasted soybeans and with fish, to name      just a few.    </p>    <p>      Mixed salad is prepared by picking two packed cups of      lettuce leaves, about one cup of dandelion crowns and a cup      of watercress. . . if you can find that much. After the      ingredients are gathered, wash them thoroughly and crisp      them in cold water or in the refrigerator. When they're      good and crisp, place all the ingredients in a large bowl      and toss with your favorite salad dressing.    </p>    <p>      Dandelion crowns, by the way, are the white leaf base found      at or below the surface of the ground. They're harvested by      cutting out and saving the section of the plant below the      leaves and above the roots as I mentioned in MOTHER NO. 3.    </p>    <p>      Watercress, the well-known plant from the supermarket, can      also be found growing in most cool, fast-flowing streams.      Harvest watercress by scissoring it off at the top of its      very loosely rooted roots. Pulling it up kills the plant.      See MOTHER N0. 8 for more information on watercress and,      for the present, let's get back to wild lettuce.    </p>    <p>      Wilted lettuce and soybeans makes a good main dish,      especially in the springtime. Grind some soybeans, which      have been soaked overnight and toasted in the oven, into      coarse flour. Heat some bacon grease in a fry pan to the      frying stage and drop washed lettuce leaves in, a few at a      time. Stir the leaves to coat them with bacon grease. As      they wilt down, add more greens until the pan is full or      until you have enough to satisfy your appetite. Continue      stirring until all the leaves are well coated and, just      before removing from the fire, sprinkle ground soybeans      over the wilted greens. Stir slightly, then remove and eat      the combination while it's hot.    </p>    <p>      Something else which is very good and which probably      closely resembles a Chinese dish, is prickly lettuce and      fish. During March and April a number of fish make their      spawning runs up small streams. One of these fish, found in      many areas mostly unprotected by regulations, is the      sucker. I spear and trap all the suckers I can get for      smoked, canned and fried fish and I also use some for      greens and fish. Now suckers, classified as rough fish,      have one disadvantage.. . they're very boney. Since I don't      like fish bones when I eat my greens and fish,    </p>    <p>      I use an old trick to separate out the good meat. This      separating takes a little time but it's worth it.    </p>    <p>      I first skin and clean a large sucker and place it in a      lightly salted pan of water. Next, I put the pan on the      fire and boil the sucker for a few minutes until the meat      will flake off the bones. I remove the fish then, let it      cool and separate the meat from the skeleton with a fork.      It takes close inspection to get rid of all the bones but      the delicious taste makes it worthwhile.    </p>    <p>      When I have a cupful of the meat cleaned, I steam a      colander full of washed wild lettuce greens over a kettle      of water for a few minutes. When the leaves begin to wilt I      mix the fish into the greens, cover the whole thing and let      it steam for about 15 minutes more. I remove the dish from      the fire at that point, possibly add a little soy sauce and      enjoy its tasty goodness while it's hot. Then I sometimes      top this meal off with a little piece of calamus candy.    </p>    <p>      Calamus, or sweet flag, is a tall leafy plant that vaguely      resembles cattail except for leaves that are much narrower      with a more yellowish-green color . . . a marsh full of      calamus is about the same shade of green as a marsh full of      cattails that are starting to dry up.    </p>    <p>      The flowers and seeds of the calamus are borne on a spadix      that projects from the side of the leaf and, strangely      enough, the plant can reproduce either from the roots or      from the seeds . . . possibly because the seeds are      produced only by plants that grow in water all year 'round.      Calamus does grow well in seasonal marshes too (where it      reproduces by extension of the roots) and folks who have a      damp place on their homestead could plant a few of those      roots there and soon have a plentiful supply of a very      useful plant.    </p>    <p>      Sweet flag roots can be dug from their shallow hiding      places beneath the surface of a marsh. I then wash mine      very well, cut them into inch-long pieces and dry them in      the attic for about a week. When the roots are dry, I place      them in a quart jar until I'm ready to use them.    </p>    <p>      Calamus root is used for calamus candy and it's a tasty and      healthful morsel worthy of almost anyone's attention.      Here's my recipe:    </p>    <p>      Dig, wash and peel a good handful of young calamus root.      Cut them into pieces about one inch long, the same as for      the dried roots (which are just as good to use as the      freshly picked ones . . . sweet flag retains its sturdy      flavor for quite some time). Oh yes, it is best to use only      the young root stalks of the calamus as the older,      yellowish ones are too tough and strong-tasting to be      really good.    </p>    <p>      Place the roots in a pressure cooker set at 15 pounds and      cook them for about one hour. Then cool the pressure      cooker, remove the top and drain the water. The roots      should be tender at that point but they may be a little too      strong-flavored to suit your taste. If so, add fresh water      and boil them for five minutes. Drain and repeat the      procedure if necessary. Three changes of water should tame      almost any young root.    </p>    <p>      Don't discard the water you drained from the calamus.      Instead, place it in a clean jar and cover it to keep as      calamus tea. This tea is used for upset or sour stomach and      is usually taken cold with a dash of honey. I can      personally vouch for its capacity for taming flatulence of      the stomach caused by soybeans. As much as I like that      particular dish, I'm glad to have my supply of calamus root      handy when I eat    </p>    <p>      it. At any rate, once the young sweet flag roots have been      cooked until they're tender, I drop them in a sauce pan. I      next cover the calamus with maple syrup and let the roots      simmer for an hour (twice as long won't hurt a thing). When      the mixture has cooled, I enjoy the sweets heartily for      days . . . or until the candy is gone. I'll admit that this      calamus candy does take a little getting used to, but it      never leaves that sour aftertaste in the mouth that comes      from eating chocolates.    </p>        <p>      Candy and tea are not the only products that can be made      from calamus. Along about April when the emerging sweet      flag plant is just a short stalk, you may also want to try      it as a dish of mighty tasty greens. Pick a good quantity      of the stalks, peel away the bitter rind and steam them.      Serve them with vinegar and oil or with a little soy sauce.    </p>    <p>      Now it just happens that early spring finds another plant      (which will complement the sweet flag to form a fresh      salad) growing into its most edible stage . . . and that      plant is sheep sorrel (see MOTHER NO. 9). It's a      low-growing plant with arrow-shaped leaves and is usually      found in sour soil. The tangy vinegar-like taste of sheep      sorrel together with the rather insipid tasting leaves of      the calamus combine to make a scrumptious fresh salad.    </p>    <p>      Pick and chop at least two cupfuls of new sweet flag shoots.      Further pick and chop at least two cups of sheep sorrel.      Toss both plants into a large bowl with a little bacon      grease and two slices of bacon which have been crisply      fried and then crumbled. That's delicious enough to close      on!    </p>
