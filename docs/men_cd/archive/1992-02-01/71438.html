                <h5 id="byline">      By Carl F. Kirkpatrick</h5>           <p>      <strong>This smart-designed recycling/separation      shed/trailer solves all your sorting and storage      troubles!</strong>    </p>        <p>      FOR YEARS I ATTEMPTED TO MAIN-tain a neatish yard-one      without rubbish barrels being my homestead's most-prominent      visual feature. When I kept the barrels outside, lined up      along the side of the garage, they were susceptible to      critters of all sorts, wild and domestic. When inside, they      took up a good deal of my workshop and invited a flow of      traffic into my workspace: rubbish man, tenants, friends,      and relatives. My invention of this recycling/separation      shed cured all my problems, and putting it together was a      fun weekend project to boot.    </p>    <p>      My shed is basically a light trailer designed and modified      to store household rubbish barrels neatly and to easily      transport their separated contents to the recycling center.      Its specialized design holds several trash barrels, covers      them with a single lid, and conceals them from view.<br />      Sure, it's got all the visual charm of a pumphouse, but its      virtues are readily apparent. It saves time in not having      to load and unload the barrels; it also saves money (my      trailer is 15 years old-how much do you pay for      rubbish removal service in a year?).    </p>    <p>      But that's just the beginning. The trailer saves garage      space; it saves the yard's appearance (mine is neatly      painted and parked behind the bushes); it saves one from      having to retrieve windblown cans and lids or being awoken      in the middle of the night by them; and it keeps away      flies, mice, rats, dogs, raccoons, and other pests.    </p>    <h3>Making the Recycling/Separation Shed</h3>   <p>      Start with a trailer-new, used, large, or small. Draw      a floor plan of it on graph paper (do this first, to see if      it will suit your situation). Next, find what's readily      available in barrel sizes. I like to buy the      "indestructible" type: They may be expensive for five or      six, but they're strong, quiet, won't dent or rust, and      will last forever in their protective enclosure. Measure      them at the top and see how many will fit into your trailer      (cut off the molded handles if they're in the way).    </p>    <p>      When that's resolved, note the height of the      barrels-without the covers-and make that the      height of the trailer sides. This is one of the keys for      the success of this project, and what makes it different      from the ordinary rubbish trailer: It seals the tops of the      barrels and provides support for the plywood lid so it      doesn't droop in the middle and collect rainwater.    </p>    <p>      Label the containers on the graph-paper plan, including all      the separating requirements, and keep in mind the order      that the bins are in at the recycling center so you can      drive through smoothly. Also consider which side of the      trailer you want to open, for your convenience at home or      at the recycling center.    </p>        <p>      The 40" X 48" trash-separation<br />      trailer (left) is made from inexpensive materials.<br />      The five bins hold trash, bottles/plastic, scrap,<br />      metal, cans, and newspapers.    </p>    <p>      You can build on any ordinary trailer frame by putting down      a ¾” exterior-plywood floor, then tongue and      groove board sides with stakes to fit the pockets on the      trailer frame. The 5' 8" exterior-plywood top overhangs all      around ¾” beyond the sides. A padlock hasp      makes a good latch to keep the top secure in winds and      during traveling. A bolt-snap is easy to use instead of a      padlock, and is only necessary for travel. To hold the top      open when using, I've always kept a short 2 x 3 inside to      prop it open. (I've never had a problem with this method,      but be careful in high or gusty winds with the lid open.)    </p>    <p>      Because this trailer spends its time outdoors, it does need      two coats of good-quality oil-base porch & deck enamel.      There's no need to paint the interior, but do paint the      underside of the top-it will stay flat and last      longer. Paint it the color of your buildings, camouflage      it, or paint the name of your farm or business on it.      Whatever you do, remember you'll have to look at it for      years.    </p>    <p>      The flat top does not collect water, never being quite on      the level enough to do so. My trailer has a folding leg,      but you can use a box to keep it nearly level when it's      parked. I mow the grass around it, then park it in a      slightly different spot each time so I can mow where it was      before. The lawn never seems to show any wear and tear      because of it. Same in winter-snow gets cleared from      around it, but no special fussing is needed. It's a lot      easier than having to clear around a row of trash barrels.    </p>    <p>      When we had tenants living in our apartment, the      understanding was that I'd haul their trash for free as      long as they complied with the town's separation rules.      This worked very well, and this trailer arrangement (with      six barrels) stored a week's trash for two families. Now      that we no longer have tenants, trips to the recycling      center are two weeks apart or more.    </p>    <p>      The only negative thing about the trailer is getting used      to backing up with it hitched on the car or truck. This is      the worst case scenario in trailerland-having a real      short trailer on a long wheelbase vehicle (just the      opposite of how a trailer truck is set up). The first rule      is to avoid getting into backing-up situations whenever you      can. Second is when you do have to back up, do it very      slowly. Take your time, stop immediately when it's not      going where you want it to, and practice to improve your      skills.    </p>    <p>      And don't be surprised by an occasional compliment. The      advantages of this setup are appreciated by the most      perceptive...after a moment or two of hard scrutiny.    </p>
