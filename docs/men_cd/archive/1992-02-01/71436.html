                <h5 id="byline">      By Flip Heilig</h5>            <p>      <strong>Build and Install a Skylight for Under $10</strong>    </p>        <p>      IN MY TRAVELS IN AND AROUND OUR new home state of New      Hampshire, I've noticed a growing number of skylights and      sky windows. And why not? There are so many advantages to      these skylights that I'm sure everyone would or should want      one or two. Aside from the romantic aspects of watching the      rain or snow fall at night with the stars glowing,      skylights cut down on your use of electricity (in our case,      kerosene) and will help heat your home on sunny days.    </p>    <p>      When I found that most of these molded-plastic. bubble-type      openings cost upwards of $200, I promptly swallowed my gum      and decided to make one of my own design. Too hard for you?      Well, I'm not a very talented person in this department,      but with a sunny afternoon and a little research at the      dump, these portholes in the roof proved to be quite simple      to add to a new or already existing structure. And let's      face it, any home improvement that can actually be done by      the <em>homeowner</em> is an invaluable source of self      esteem, and accomplishing it for almost nothing can only      add to that good feeling.    </p>    <p>      First gather all the materials (most of which can be      scrounged for free) and tools necessary for the job. The      building process will only take about two hours.    </p>    <h3>Materials Needed</h3>    <p>      Old window (from a dump or demolition company)<br />      1" x 4" board cut to the length you need (this is      determined by adding 2" on all<br />      sides of your window and measuring)<br />      2" x 6" board the appropriate length for a window      casing<br />      1" x 2" board to support the window in the casing on all      sides<br />      1" x 6" or 1" x 8" board the length of your window<br />      1 quart roofing tar and a suitable paint brush<br />      4 pieces of lath<br />      1 piece of 6 mil clear plastic at least 10 inches larger      than window on either side<br />      1 pound each eight- and tenpenny common nails<br />      1 box small staples<br />      Scrap roofing (about 2 yards)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tools needed:</strong><br />      hammer<br />      saw<br />      square<br />      pencil    </p>        <h3>Constructing the Skylight</h3>    <p>      When it's time to go to work, be sure to pick a day when      you'll have a few hours of sunshine. (These directions are      for an already existing building, but if you're building a      new home, it's even easier.)<br />      1. Remove all roofing where hole is to be cut.<br />      2. Cut hole in your roof the size of your window. Being on      the lazy side, I used a chain saw, but a hand saw will work      just as well.<br />      3. Measure and cut 2" x 6" board and frame under edge of      hole, making a casing for the window to set in.<br />      4. Measure and cut 1" x 2" boards to fit inside of casing      flush with bottom and nail.<br />      5. Set window in place (and smile because it's startin' to      take shape)<br />      6. Build a frame from the 1" x 4", two inches larger on      all<br />      sides than the hole and nail to roof.<br />      7. Cut 1" x 6" or 1" x 8" to fit inside across middle of      frame. Cut so board tapers to four inches at the ends and      nail in place.<br />      8. Tar and paper around frame on roof.<br />      9. Cover with plastic and staple in place.<br />      10. Nail lath around outside of frame to help secure      plastic.    </p>    <p>      Now enjoy all the warm sunlight shining in through your      roof. In the evening you won't have to light your lamps as      early, which will save you what it cost to build this      economical, practical skylight.<br />    </p>

A heavy plastic wrap will do nicely, but make certain that no moisture can sneak between the frame and the roofing.
