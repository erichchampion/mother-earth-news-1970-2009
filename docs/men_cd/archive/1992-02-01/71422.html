                <h5 id="byline">      By Ronald C. Sawyer    </h5>        <p>      <strong>A New Design For Early Garden Success</strong>    </p>        <p>      ALMOST ANYONE CAN grow a good garden in the summertime. But      what about harvesting crops in the middle of spring, when      your neighbors are just beginning to turn over their own      ground? It's the ability to create an early harvest that      separates the superior gardener from the run of the mill.      Here in upstate New York, where we have frosts as late as      May, I start eating from my garden in mid-April. How is      this possible? A plastic-tunnel cold frame. With      forethought and timely execution, you too can have a garden      earlier than you ever thought possible.    </p>    <h3>      Cold-Frame Design and Construction    </h3>    <p>      Siting the cold frame correctly is essential to success. On      any piece of property there is usually some far warmer      area. This is the one you should seek out for the cold      frame. But a good site alone will not allow most plants to      survive cold nighttime temperatures. For that, you must      create an artificial environment, one that will allow your      seeds to germinate and your plants to prosper.    </p>    <p>      My introduction to such protection occurred when I lived in      Spain many years ago. The government was encouraging small      producers to raise early crops by setting up inexpensive      <em>tuneles de plastico</em> in the late winter. Over the      years I have tried the tunnel and many more elaborate      designs for protection of crops from the early-season cold.      In considering a cold-frame design, you should apply the      following criteria: One, it should be easy to build and      made of standard materials. Two, it should be cheap. Three,      it should be fast to put up and take down. And four, it      should not only keep your plants warm, but it should keep      them from getting too hot.    </p>    <p>      The following design meets all these criteria. The frame      itself is made of 2 x 4s nailed together to make a bed four      feet wide by 24 feet long. It is simply set on top of the      prepared ground and staked down. As the level of the soil      goes up over time, additional 2 x 4s can be toenailed into      the lower layer to make the frame higher.    </p>    <p>      The components of the plastic tunnel cover are also simple.      Go down to your local construction-supply company and have      them cut some eight-foot sections of 3/8” rebar. When      you get home, jam the rebar against something and bend each      section into a modified hooplike shape, because it is      better if the last 14 inches or so of each end is straight      so it can be pushed into the ground easily. (The bending      takes a lot of effort, so borrow a strong friend if you      cannot do it yourself.) Push the hoops into the ground on      the outside of the frame at about 26-inch centers (which      offers enough support to hold a small snow load) and secure      each one to the frame with a couple of nails. Then spread      28 feet of eight-feet-wide plastic over the hoops and the      framed garden, with a four-foot overhang on each end.    </p>    <p>      Secure one of the long sides of the cover by sandwiching      the plastic between some nailer strips and the frame      itself. This side will not have to be removed until the      entire cover is put away after all danger of frost has      passed. The other long side and the ends are arranged for      ventilation, which can be achieved by turning back one of      the long sides (a necessary step anyway when you wish to      work in the garden). This "mobile" side should be secured      to an opening wand, which is made of 1" x 2" overlapping      furring strips that have been clasp-nailed together to make      a continuous length of 24 feet.    </p>    <p>      Again, the plastic should be sandwiched between nailer      strips (scrap lath, screen molding, etc.) and the opening      wand so that the nail heads do not rip through the plastic.      The cold frame can be opened entirely simply by rolling up      the plastic onto the opening wand, which is then placed on      the opposite or fixed side of the frame. But      actually-no matter how hot the weather gets-the      plastic hardly needs to be completely rolled back. Instead,      it can be rolled up halfway, so it is sitting on top of the      hoops, secured by placing the ends of the furring-strip      wand into notched vertical 2 x 4s that have been nailed to      the end of the frame. (The bottom of the notches are at the      same height as the top of the hoops.)    </p>    <p>      End ventilation, which is almost always sufficient, is even      easier. The ends are normally kept loosely rolled in a      spare four-foot wooden piece sitting on the ground. To      ventilate, just unroll the plastic from the piece of wood,      roll it back up on itself, secure it with a clip or stuff      it between the last metal hoop and the vertical support      member. With both ends open you get good cross-ventilation.    </p>    <p>      No matter how high the winds or how fierce the spring rains      and snow, this cold frame sits proudly. Most snow simply      slides off as it falls, and any that attempts to accumulate      soon melts away from the heat radiated by the dark soil      within. Moreover, the whole thing is really cheap,      averaging out at less than $10 per year.    </p>    <h3>      Setting Up and Managing a Cold Frame    </h3>    <p>      I always set up and plant the garden in the second half of      March. Because my soil is so black, it is free of snow and      has thawed out long before the surrounding area. I wait for      one of those unusually warm days that we sometimes get in      this area at the end of the winter when it is a joy to be      working outside. (One March, I went cross-country skiing in      a park just 30 miles from here in the morning and planted      my garden the same afternoon.) With all materials on hand,      I can construct the cold frame and plant the entire garden      in a long afternoon.    </p>    <p>      In my many years of managing the cold frame, I have never      had any trouble with cold damage despite spells of weather      in the teens. Of course, I do not seed or set out any      cold-sensitive plants early in the season. However, I have      persistently experienced two kinds of serious problems that      call for constant vigilance.    </p>        <p>      The first is damage caused by excessive heat. The only time      I feel comfortable with having the tunnel completely sealed      is when nothing has germinated yet. Indeed, the tunnel is a      marvelous seed germinator. But the heat so wonderful for      germination is excessive once the seedlings have emerged. A      cloudless day in the 70s can take the temperature in the      tunnel to 150°F, and the crops you have nursed through      the fierce March weather will wilt, scorch, bake, and      finally perish in the April sun. This has happened to me      more than once. Each year I vow: Never again.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, think ventilation. When in doubt, ventilate. If      you go away on all but the coldest of days, ventilate. End      ventilation is almost always sufficient. The lovely moist      and warm environment can turn to a savage and killing heat      literally in a matter of minutes if the clouds blow away. A      little cold wind on your plants will do small damage      compared to excessive temperatures.    </p>    <p>      The second problem arises from too much organic matter in      the garden. If you are like me, you take pride in the      lovely structure of your soil. But too often my compost is      not quite as broken-down as it should be. Including this      kind of stuff-or worse yet, manure-in a plastic      tunnel garden is a recipe for failure. Fungi thrive in this      kind of environment. The result will be rampant damping off      and other diseases. After having lost several crops to this      problem, I now exercise utmost caution. I keep this garden      a little sparer on organic content than an open-air one. If      there is any indication of weakness in the soil I can      always add a bit of liquid fertilizer, such as fish or      seaweed emulsion.    </p>        <h3>      Irrigation    </h3>    <p>      Setting up a handy irrigation system within the cold frame      is the smartest move I ever made. Trying to water from the      outside with a watering can or hose is always a bit of a      hassle and might involve turning the plastic completely      back at an inopportune time.    </p>    <p>      But a fixed hose is just the right thing. I affix a 50-foot      hose to the top edge of the 2 x 4 frame, beginning on a      long side one foot from the end and finishing a near      circuit of the frame on the other side, one foot from that      end. (That's 23 feet down one side, across the four-foot      end, and back 23 feet on the other side, with a two-foot      tail as a connector.) I then poke holes in the hose with a      pin at regular intervals so that the water squirts directly      into the garden. I have found this set-up far superior to      and certainly much cheaper than any custom-made irrigation      system that I can buy. I seal one end of the irrigation      hose with a cap and connect the other end to a hose which      runs to a faucet.    </p>    <p>      The total cost of this semi-automatic irrigation system is      five bucks. One turn of the faucet and the garden waters      itself. How much water you should apply takes quite a bit      of experience and observation. You do not want to overwater      for the same reason you do not want to have fresh manure in      your frame-it tends to promote fungal growth and      plant disease.    </p>    <p>      <strong>I particularly like to have some fast-growing      things so I can amaze my friends with<br />      garden food when the snow is barely off the      ground.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The day that I plant the garden, I water it heavily and      then seal it shut. Then, no more watering is required at      least until the seeds germinate. After that, watering      depends on the temperature, the robustness of foliage      growth, and the amount of ventilation. Obviously, with no      ventilation, your system is a closed one and should require      almost no additional irrigation. But the moment you      ventilate, you will have to irrigate in order to supply the      rapidly growing plants with the moisture that they need.    </p>    <p>      One other advantage of this system is that the whole thing      stays in place after you have put away the plastic. I have      often thought of adding an automatic or even computerized      timer to regulate the whole system, but have decided      against it. Besides the additional cost, such automation      would begin to make me feel superfluous.    </p>    <h3>      Crops and Crop Rotation    </h3>    <p>      You will select those crops for the cold frame that most      appeal to you and that suit the particular conditions found      under plastic. Because of the limited space available in      the cold frame, you will probably want to plant very      intensively, as in French intensive gardening. This      technique measures its success by what percentage of the      entire bed is a completely covered with foliage at each      moment of the season. I call this "the art of plenitude."    </p>    <p>      I try to plant the entire bed the first day of the season      with a spacing that still allows for a couple more      plantings within the first one. The initial planting      comprises crops that can take some cool weather, mostly      various kinds of greens for cooking or eating in salads.      The second planting is of seeds of warm-weather crops, and      the next one is of seedlings of warm-weather crops. I aim      to get several crops from each bit of space, by rotation,      by planned competition, and by understory/overstory      (sometimes even tri-story) sharing of space. Of course,      there are many crops that I would never think of planting      in the cold frame at all-such as peas, onions,      potatoes, etc.-but instead place directly in the      regular garden.    </p>    <p>      My first planting of greens is a real blessing after a cold      winter because I am a real fresh-vegetable junkie. By about      May 1, I have converted a third of my diet to garden salad      and cooked greens and I try to stay that way until the      following November, long after most people's gardens have      gone kaput. I particularly like to have some fast-growing      things so I can amaze my friends with garden food when the      snow is barely off the ground.    </p>    <p>      There are some standards I plant every year because they      have stood the test of time. The first and fastest is      garden cress, which seems to sprout the moment the seeds      hit the damp earth, and is ready to pick in just a couple      of weeks. Next are radishes, which I broadcast thickly,      thinning some of the greens for immediate consumption and      letting the rest develop into radishes themselves. I have      really come to prefer white radishes during the last few      years and have stopped planting the red ones.    </p>    <p>      Then I plant coriander, having soaked the seeds on my      windowsill for a week. Just by accident I learned that      coriander germinates much better if its tough outer seed      shell is rotted through.    </p>    <p>      Another standard crop is lettuce, which I never go without.      I usually plant most of the year's lettuce early in the      cold frame by broadcasting a mixture of seeds of early      season, mid-season, and late-season lettuce together and      then thinning them quite severely, leaving some head type      to carry me through most of the summer. This year for the      first time I planted a commercially provided "mesclun mix,"      which I harvest frequently by cutting back with a scissors.      I also generally plant what I have come to call "yuppie      greens," such as arugula and radicchio. And finally, I      always plant a lot of spinach, which is deliciously      succulent when grown under plastic.    </p>    <p>      But salad and cooking greens are only part of the      cold-frame garden. Once the soil warms up a bit, I plant      warm-season crops from seed. At one end of the garden I      plant zucchini and on the other end cucumbers. As they      grow, I gradually pick and eat all their competition. When      the plastic is removed, the huge zucchini plants hang way      outside of the frame. At the other end, I train the      cucumbers to a six-foot netted trellis, which uses      remarkably little planting space. As the cucumbers grow      towards the sky, they give a bountiful harvest, much more      than when allowed to lie on the ground.    </p>    <p>      The cold frame also really comes in handy for tomato and      pepper crops. I set out plants four to six weeks earlier      than I would otherwise. Long ago, when I had a one-acre      garden and was selling vegetables on the side, I planted      100 tomato plants. Now I plant just eight, which gives me      more than enough tomatoes wrapped in newspaper in my attic.      I set the tomato plants out at previously marked spots      between rows of greens and harvest the greens as they      compete with the tomatoes. I also support the tomatoes on      six-foot-high wooden trellises and prune them rather      severely. The partial shade made by the trellis is actually      appreciated by the lettuce and a few other understory      greens once the torrid days of July arrive and they are      thinking of going to seed, which for my purposes is nothing      but a betrayal.    </p>    <p>      Finally, I add pepper plants to the cold frame. Peppers do      not do very well in upstate New York; they seem to stand      around for a long time, as if to say, "You know, the nights      ought to be hotter around here if you really want me to      grow." But I've managed to have some success by planting      when the soil is quite warm and by reducing competition to      a minimum. With some prodding, the plants can produce nice      bell, banana, and hot peppers in the second half of August      and the entire month of September. Finally, the cold frame      can also be used for raising a variety of seedlings for the      rest of your garden.    </p>    <p>      I take the plastic tunnel down about June 1, when all      danger of frost is past and the plants want more room      anyway. The plastic should be hosed down, air dried, and      rolled in a black plastic garbage bag, to be stored until      the following year. The other materials should also be      cleaned and put away so that the next spring they will be      ready to go at the drop of a hat. Of course, the frame      itself should be left up permanently. Presumably, one could      reassemble the tunnel for autumn crops, but the garden does      so well without protection at that time of year that I do      not bother.    </p>    <p>      Cold frames have been around for a long time. The one I      have described here is cheap and convenient. If you use it      just one year, it is unlikely you will ever want to garden      again without it.    </p>
