                <h5 id="byline">      By Rink Mann    </h5>    <p><strong>      Going for the Golden Delicious</strong></p>                <p>      <em>The author with his homemade water-pressure-tank<br />      evaporating rig.</em>    </p>    <p>      I SUPPOSE I GOT INVOLVED IN BACK-yard sugarin' the day my      determination to make maple syrup ran smack dab into my      good wife's determination that the boiling down not be done      on the kitchen stove. I must say she has a point. You see,      the main thing about making maple syrup is you have to boil      off about 32 parts of water in the form of steam to end up      with one part of maple syrup. That means that if you're      boiling down a batch some Saturday afternoon on the kitchen      stove and are aiming, say, for three quarts of syrup,      you're going to put about 24 gallons of water into the air      before the boiling's done.    </p>    <p>      Unless you've got one awfully powerful exhaust fan, you'll      end up with water streaming down the walls and enough steam      to impair visibility across the room. And, when things      finally do clear, you're apt to find the wallpaper lying on      the floor. Then, too, even if the batch doesn't boil over,      which it can, the sugar spray from all that furious boiling      gets all over the stove and is harder than blazes to get      off. So, if you want to maintain a measure of domestic      tranquillity, it's best to do your boiling-most of it      anyway-outside, or in a handy garage or shed.    </p>    <p>      Anyway, the day I lost my kitchen privileges was the day I      started figuring out in earnest what equipment I might need      to set up a proper evaporator in a little sugar house. I      was soon up to my eyebrows in catalogs and books on the      time-honored methods used to make maple syrup. This all      made good reading, but the smallest evaporator I could find      was designed to handle up to 35 buckets, producing about 12      gallons of syrup during the season and costing better than      $600. When I figured out the number of buckets I'd need to      collect enough sap to make it worthwhile to run the      evaporator-plus the holding tanks, instruments, and      other gear, not to mention building a small sugar house to      store everything in-I knew I was looking at an      investment well into four figures. It became clear that I'd      have to get into the business of selling syrup just to make      ends meet.    </p>    <p>      I wasn't about to make that kind of commitment to sugarin',      but I was just as determined to make my own syrup-say      three or four gallons a year. I had my own sugar maples,      plenty of firewood, an attraction to maple sugar like a      bear has to honey, and enough Yankee blood in me to take      pride in saving upwards of $56 a gallon in the      process.<br />      So the only solution I could come up with was to improvise.      I scrounged up an old 18" x 24" commercial baking pan,      built a firebox under it out of cement blocks, stuck some      used stovepipe out the back, and produced what I consider      to be a very satisfying batch of golden delicious right out      there in the backyard.</p>      <h3>Planning Ahead</h3>        <p>      With backyard sugarin', one of the things you have to do is      plan ahead. Since the amount and type of equipment you'll      need depends a good deal on the quantity of syrup you're      planning to make, the first thing to decide is just how      greedy you are.</p>    <p>      For demonstration, let's assume you want five gallons of      syrup by the end of the sugarin' season, and      that-because you do have other things to tend to      during the mud season, which is also sugarin'      season-you can only do your boiling on weekends.    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally you wouldn't mistake a white birch for a      maple, nor would you hang a<br />      bucket on a telephone pole-although I've seen that      done to get a rise out of city folks.</em>    </p>        <p>      With that decision out of the way, we can make the      following calculations:    </p>    <p>      For each quart of syrup you'll need one tap hole in a sugar      maple, assuming you collect all the sap and don't spill too      much of it on the way to the evaporator. Thus, for 20      quarts, you're going to have to drill 20 holes, set 20      spouts, and hang 20 buckets.    </p>    <p>      The number of maple trees you'll need depends on their      size. You're not supposed to tap a tree under 10" in      diameter, but you can put two taps in a tree over 18" in      diameter and three in one that's over, say, 28". On a real      big old maple you can hang even more buckets, but when I      see some stately ancient maple fastened with five or six      buckets it makes me think someone's bleeding it to death.      So I try to make do with fewer buckets on more trees. In      any case, getting back to that 20-quart plan, you're going      to need four three-bucket trees, three two-bucket trees,      and a couple of one-bucket trees (or whatever other      combination adds up to 20 taps). Suffice it to say that you      should plan ahead, know what maples you'll need to tap, and      get permission to tap them if they don't belong to you.    </p>    <p>      According to the generally accepted rule of thumb, a      professional wood-fired evaporator will consume a cord of      firewood for each 25 gallons of syrup being made.      Theoretically, therefore, you'd need 1/2 of a cord to      produce your five gallons of syrup, but don't you believe      it. Since you'll probably boil down on four or five      separate weekends during the season and will be using a      homemade evaporator that can hardly match the efficiency of      the professional rigs, you'll probably need half a cord of      good, dry wood to make your syrup.    </p>    <p>      Now, in boiling sap you want a good, roaring fire, not a      slow burner like in your living-room fireplace. It doesn't      make a lot of difference what kind of wood it is just so's      it bums well. (You can and should bum pine and other      softwoods that you wouldn't use in your fireplace: The      pitch just adds to the heat.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, give some forethought as to how you're going to      can and store your golden hoard. You'll want to save up      enough containers during the year to hold whatever amount      you produce-preferably metal cans, although glass      jars with screw-on tops are fine if they don't break when      you pour hot syrup into them.    </p>    <p>      My own choice is to save up coffee cans-the ones that      come with plastic lids for resealing. The two-pound size      holds half a gallon of syrup, so for five gallons you'd      need to save up 10 two-pound coffee cans during the year.      You can buy those lithographed cans made especially for      syrup, but the half-gallon size costs better than $ 1.70      each, and then only if you buy in lots of 100 from the      factory. As I said before, backyard sugarin' is about      finding ways to make and store syrup without spending any      money to speak of.    </p>    <h3>Selecting Your Trees</h3>       <p>      Figuring out what trees to tap, when to tap them, and just      where and how to drill the hole and set the spout are      important parts of backyard sugarin'. If you do these      things carefully, it will increase the amount and quality      of sap you'll get, yield a higher ratio of syrup to sap      (which means less boiling), and may save you a lot of      struggling through deep snow to taps that aren't worth the      effort.    </p>    <p>      Naturally you wouldn't mistake a white birch for a maple,      nor would you hang a bucket on a telephone      pole-although I've seen that done to get a rise out      of city folks. But four different kinds of maple trees      native to the United States, all of which produce spring      sap flows, can be tapped and will produce maple syrup.      These four trees are the Sugar Maple ( <em>acer      saccharum</em> ), also called the Hard Maple by furniture      makers; the Silver (or White or Soft) Maple ( <em>acer      saccharnum</em> ); the Red Maple ( <em>acer rubrum</em> ),      also known as the Swamp Maple; and the Ash-Leafed Maple (      <em>acer negundo</em> ), more popularly known as the Box      Elder.    </p>    <p>      The important fact is that the sap from the Sugar Maple      contains about 3% sugar, whereas the saps from the other      contains half to two-thirds as much. Also, the syrups made      from these other saps are darker and less flavorful, so      confining your sugarin' to Sugar Maples means less boiling      and better syrup.    </p>    <p>      In picking out your trees, assuming you've got more than      enough to give you the taps to meet your production goal,      keep these things in mind:    </p>    <p>      The sap flowers best in healthy trees with an abundance of      branches. Avoid sparsely limbed trees or ones with a lot of      dead branches.    </p>    <p>      Pick trees that will be the easiest to get to come sugarin'      time, when there may be several feet of snow on the ground.      That's why old-timers put them along roads.    </p>    <p>      Since the sap will flow best on warm, above-freezing      nights, pick trees with open southern exposures so that the      warm sun on the trunk of the tree will get things running      as soon as possible each morning.    </p>        <h3>When, How, and Where to Tap</h3>      <p>      Sugarin' time is that special part of late winter (call it      early spring if you will), when the temperature drops below      the freezing point at night but climbs well above freezing      during the day, pushed up by a sun which is now climbing      higher in the sky, getting up earlier in the morning, and      lasting longer in the afternoon. The alternate freezing and      thawing of the slowly disappearing snow gives it a granular      texture, which skiers call corn snow and which they love to      ski on in the warm sun. And the native folk up-country      grumble about "mud season," get all worked up over the      annual Town Meeting, and start tapping trees for their      annual sugarin'.    </p>        <p>      The arguments about just when to tap (combined with sage      observations on the weather and past experiences) can be      just as heated as the politics. If you tap too early and      get an extended cold spell, the taps can dry out and you      may have to re-bore your holes. Or, if you wait too long,      you may miss the first big sap run, which is prized for its      high sugar content and fine quality.    </p>    <p>      I'd say the smart thing to do is to set a spout in one of      your trees fairly early, and when you start getting sap      flow during a day whose weather is fairly typical for that      time of year, go ahead and set the rest of the taps.    </p>    <p>      Here are the things to pay attention to when you select      where to drill the hole and how to set your spout:    </p>    <p>      Use a 7/16” bit to drill the hole. This is the right      size to take the standard metal sap spouts you can buy at      hardware stores in sugarin' country, or a spout made out of      a whittled-down ½” dowel with a hole drilled      down the center.    </p>    <p>      Drill your taphole about 1½” into good wood      (which means maybe 2½” in heavy bark). This      isn't a critical measurement-just be sure you're into      good wood, where the sap flows, and have a hole deep enough      to accommodate your spout. Drill the hole slightly uphill,      so the sap flows outward, and keep turning the drill      forward as you pull the bit out, in order to get as many      shavings as possible out with the bit. (On days when the      sap is flowing, you'll see it running out at you almost      before you can get the spout in.)    </p>    <p>      Set the spout in the hole and send it home with a      <em>light</em> hammer tap (on the front of the metal crest,      if you're using a metal spout). The idea here is to set the      spout snugly so it won't fall out of the tree, yet without      splitting the maple wood above or below the taphole, where      the sap would leak.    </p>    <p>      Remember: If you're standing on top of a four-foot snowbank      when making your tap holes at the beginning of the season,      those taps may be seven feet off the ground near the end of      the season when the snowbank has melted. It's hard to      collect sap from buckets seven feet off the ground.    </p>    <p>      Stop collecting sap and pull your taps when you: a) have      made enough syrup to satisfy your needs; b) have run out of      storage cans and/or your spouse's patience; c) find that      the syrup is getting dark colored (the result of warm or      fermenting sap) or less sweet; and/or d) notice that the      sap has become cloudy or yellowish (although a cold snap      can cause a return of clear sap). There are no specific      rules for pulling your spouts. Don't worry about the holes:      After awhile the sap just quits coming-they'll heal      up by themselves, as they've done for generations.    </p>        <h3>Buckets and Pails</h3>     <p>      Conventional sugarin' calls for 13- or 16-quart sap buckets      made of galvanized steel (English tin in the old days, and      before that wooden buckets). Galvanized buckets come with      either flat or bowed covers to keep out rainwater and      debris, and they have a hole in the upper edge where you      hang the bucket from a small hook that comes with the metal      sap spout. These buckets cost over $7 each (with covers) if      you buy them direct from the manufacturer; more if you have      to buy them locally. Since you're going to get enough sap      from each bucket to make about one quart of syrup,      conventional buckets can be a hefty investment, unless      you're ready to commit yourself to their use over and over      again for many years ahead. Most backyarders get around      this expense by using almost any old container that will      hold sap, from peanut-butter cans to children's beach      pails.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>If you plan to boil sap into syrup on your      backyard rig, the pan it ends up in should<br />      not be too shallow-thus risking scorching after all      that patient work.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the most important developments in the      backyard-sugarin' industry was the advent of the one-gallon      plastic milk bottle, known affectionately hereabouts as the      Idlenot Dairy Low-Fat Sap Bucket (since that happens to be      the dairy that supplies our milk). If you're any sort of      milk-drinking family, you can save up more than enough of      these gallon milk bottles to provide you with all the sap      buckets you'll need.    </p>    <p>      The way you hang one of these low-fat sap buckets is to cut      a hole with a utility knife about ¾” square      just below the collar, under the bottle top, and hang the      bottle with sap spout entering this hole and the bottle set      down over the back of the metal crest on the spout. Leave      the cap on. The bottle will hang there nice as you please,      even in a strong March breeze.    </p>    <h3>Sap Storage</h3>    <p>      Maple sap, like cider or any fruit juice, can spoil, and      care must be taken to keep it as cool as possible and not      to store it too long before boiling it down. Sap which has      "spoiled" has an unclear, slightly milky look, and if      boiled down it will produce a dark syrup. Professional      sugarers generally boil down sap within a day or two of its      collection, if not the same day. If you're a backyarder,      with other things to do during the week and no real desire      to sit up all night tending the evaporator, you'll need to      figure out not only how much storage capacity you'll need      for the sap collected during the week, but also where to      store it with the least chance of spoilage.    </p>    <p>      Returning to the original example of wanting to end up with      five gallons of syrup by the end of the season, and      assuming now that you will fire up your evaporator for one      boil down on each of five successive weekends, count on      producing one gallon each weekend, for which you will need      33 gallons of sap. (This is a reliable ratio for my part of      New Hampshire, but 40 parts could be closer-depending      on the location, weather, time of the season, and other      mysterious factors.) Therefore, you will need at least that      amount of storage, and it would be wise to have 50 gallons      of holding capacity to accommodate heavy sap runs.    </p>    <p>      A couple of plastic or galvanized trash cans make good      holding tanks for an operation of this size, if they can be      spared from their normal duties. Naturally, they should be      cleaned out well, but be careful not to use harsh soaps or      chemicals, which might affect taste. Remember that your sap      will undergo extended boiling, which will take care of      bacteria.    </p>    <h3>Engineering Principles of a Backyard      Evaporator</h3>      <p>      Now that we've disposed of the task of collecting all that      slightly foamy, faintly sweet, and rather colorless-looking      sap, the next order of business is to convert it into that      gooey, mystically sweet, and golden substance called pure      maple syrup. The process involves boiling the sap so that      the water evaporates off in the form of steam, leaving the      sugar behind in the boiling pan. Sounds simple, doesn't it?      And it really is, although at certain stages of the      process, particularly as you're getting your brew close to      being syrup, there can be terrifying moments.    </p>    <p>      In boiling down sap, the idea is to get the job done fast      by maximizing the amount of steam coming off the surface.      You do that in two ways. First, you use an evaporator pan      that's relatively shallow (6" to 8") but with a lot of      area, so as to have a large boiling-surface area relative      to the amount of sap in the pan. Second, you design the      firebox to get as much flame as possible directly on the      bottom of the pan. That means the firebox should be      somewhat shallow as well. And, since the flames tend to be      swept backward toward the flue by the draft (rather than      upwards against the pan), many backyarders build up the      rear bottom of their fireboxes with sand so that the flames      are forced to arch up against the pan-just like with      professional rigs.    </p>    <p>      The firebox is constructed so that the pan (or pans) sits      on the top, supported by the edge of the firebox or so that      the pan can nestle down within it. The reason for nestling      is to hasten the process by protecting the edges of the pan      from the cold breezes. Or, if the pan does sit on top, you      often find a row of bricks, set down along the edge of the      pan to serve the same protective purpose.    </p>    <p>      How big a firebox you'll need depends on how much sap you      want to boil down and how much time you can spare to do the      job:    </p>    <p>      The more sap, the more surface area, the bigger the pan,      and the bigger the firebox you'll need. My own new backyard      evaporator, which has 864 square inches of boiling surface,      seems to produce a consistent one quart of syrup per hour      of boiling time.    </p>    <p>      However, if you plan to boil your sap all the way to syrup      on your backyard rig, the pan it ends up in should not be      so large that your syrup level is too shallow- thus      risking scorching after all that patient work. As an      example, a weekender who plans to end up with one gallon      should probably not use a pan much over 14" x 17", since      his syrup will be only 1" deep in a pan of that size (there      are 231 cubic inches per gallon).    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if he uses an evaporator pan only 14" x      17", and assuming for a moment that my own experience is      reliable, it would take him close to 14 hours to boil down      his 33 gallons of sap.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>The local dump is well worth canvassing, if      they'll let you in to scrounge around.<br />      Scrounging, improvising, modifying: That's what sugarin' is      all about.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      There are two solutions to this dilemma. Our weekender can      use a single large pan to speed up the main boiling and do      his final boiling elsewhere (maybe in the kitchen if the      wife is gone for the day), or he can use two pans atop his      firebox-one, say, 12" x 16". which would give him      some decent depth for the final boiling; and the other 16"      x 24" for boiling fresh sap at the back of the firebox. The      combination would give him 576 square inches of boiling      area, requires a firebox opening of 16" x 36", and gives      him a six-hour boil-down period.    </p>    <p>      I put all this down not to get into an argument over      whether or not you can make a gallon of syrup from 33      gallons of sap in six hours on 576 square inches of      evaporator pans, but rather to show you the kinds of      calculations you have to go through to build a backyard      sugarin' rig to meet your needs. Then, too, you may have to      approach the problem from the opposite direction and size      your rig (and how you use it) to a pan or set of pans that      are already in hand.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, before we get into specific examples of a      backyard evaporator, it's appropriate to discuss how you      might come by a suitable evaporator pan without having to      spend a lot of money.    </p>    <h3>Evaporator Pans</h3>      <p>      If all that talk about needing special-size evaporator pans      is discouraging you, don't let it. Professionally made      pans, with spigots, fluted bottoms and so forth, are      frightfully expensive, but you'll find it surprisingly easy      to pick up secondhand bake pans at hotels or restaurant      auctions that are sized close enough for your needs.    </p>    <p>      My first evaporator pan was an oversize 18" x 24"      commercial lasagna pan that nobody wanted. It was covered      with old lasagna, but after a good cleaning I found I had      an excellent steel pan of old-time quality, and it has      served me well ever since.    </p>    <p>      It's also not very hard to make your own pans out of      galvanized sheet metal. A 14" x 16" pan can be made out of      a 30" x 32" sheet of metal. With corners mitered, folded      around the ends, and locked in place, an evaporator pan      needs no welding and very little cutting. The bending,      particularly working out the corners, takes some doing and      a lot of hammering, and while the heavier gauges of metal      make better pans, it takes a lot more pounding to get them      into shape. The metal for this pan might cost you $5 or $6      in a sheet-metal shop. Experimenting, improvising,      modifying. That's what backyard sugarin' is all about.    </p>        <h3>Building a Homemade Backyard<br /> Evaporator</h3>        <p>      Making your own backyard evaporator is a process of sizing      up what materials you have lying around your place, what      you can scrounge up elsewhere, and putting together      something that will get a lot of hot flames against the      bottom of your evaporator pan with a reasonably efficient      use of firewood and with some degree of fire control.    </p>    <p>      If you somehow happen to be related to a building-supply      dealer, maybe you can get him to give you some "irregular"      cement blocks to build your evaporator out of. Or perhaps a      local plumber might have some discarded water-pressure      tanks out behind his shop. With an emery blade on your      electric saw or a cutting torch, you can make a very      professional-acting (if not looking) evaporator.    </p>    <p>      And with any luck, a heating contractor might have an old      oil-storage tank he'll let you have, which would make up      into a nice firebox, as well as some rusty old      stovepipe-just the ticket for your smokestack.    </p>    <p>      The local dump is well worth canvassing, if they'll still      let you in to scrounge around. I found two very serviceable      water-pressure tanks for myself, a third for a fellow      backyarder, and about eight feet of serviceable 8"      stovepipe for my evaporator. Fifty-gallon drums make good      evaporator fireboxes, and (if you can find reasonably clean      ones) sap storage tanks. I like to think that finding such      items in the local dump and putting them back into useful      service is a very commendable aspect of sugarin'.    </p>    <p>      Each backyard sugarer differs in his production      goals-and therefore in the size evaporator he will      need-and in the materials available to him and in his      skills in making do with what he can get.    </p>            <h3>The Author's Converted Water-Pressure-Tank      Evaporator</h3>      <p>      My own sugarin' rig-which has evolved out of years of      experimentation, observation, and trial and error-is      a resurrected water-pressure tank set up off the ground on      a couple of fieldstones. It has been modified (with a      blowtorch) to accommodate two boiling pans, both fabricated      out of folded sheet metal. The rear pan is a larger,      "primary boil" pan, and the front is a smaller pan for      finishing.    </p>    <p>      The rig is located under a lean-to, made out of small tree      logs stretched between a few large boulders in that area,      and the roof is made out of salvaged sheet-metal roofing. A      length or two of old 8" stovepipe runs from the evaporator      up through the roof, and there is a 90° bend at the top      which can be turned downwind to create a venturi to improve      draft up the chimney.<br />      My storage facility consists of two former fruit-juice      drums from which I ladle the fresh sap directly into the      rear pan.    </p>    <p>      On the northeast side of my lean-to I stack firewood-      mostly broken branches and dead limbs collected from nearby      woods during the year. This helps protect the area from the      cold northeasterly breezes that make nighttime sugarin' a      bit cold.    </p>    <h3>How I Do it-Step by Step</h3>     <p>      A good way to cover the boiling-down process might be to      take you right through it, step by step, using my own      two-pan, converted water-pressure-tank evaporator as an      example. Naturally, you'll run into problems and crises      with a rig of your own design, but I hope that by looking      over my shoulder you'll avoid some of the more obvious      pitfalls and perhaps see an improvement you might care to      pass along to me.    </p>    <p>      Having collected enough sap in the storage drums (about 50      gallons) to insure ending up with no less than six quarts      of syrup in the front pan (to avoid scorching in my      finishing pan), I ladle a good 2" of sap in both pans      before starting the fire. Fresh sap should continue to be      ladled into the back pan to maintain an approximate 2"      level as water is boiled off, and to replace boiling sap      which I ladle up to the front pan to maintain its level.    </p>    <p>      Since the coffee can I use to ladle boiling sap gets a bit      too hot to handle barehanded, I made up a little handle for      it: It's a piece of green birch-a small branch coming      out from a main stem. If you split the branch in toward the      stem, you can slide the can into the split and it will stay      there without fastening. (At least it did for me.)    </p>    <p>      During the boiling you'll notice some scummy-looking foam      building up around the edges of your pans. This is a      natural byproduct of the boiling and should not cause any      alarm. Since it tends to reduce the boiling-surface area,      though, it should be skimmed off from time to time. I use a      kitchen strainer and simply pitch the foam off into the      snow. Any residual foam in the batch will be removed when      you filter your syrup.    </p>    <p>      A good candy thermometer is useful here because, as sap      boils and gradually thickens, its temperature goes up due      to the increased sugar content. Thus, temperature is a good      measurement of the progress toward, and arrival at, the      syrup stage. When it has risen 7°F above the      temperature of boiling water at the same place and time      (get a reading from some boiling water, and add 7° to      that to get the measurement you're looking for), you're      where you want to be.    </p>    <p>      As the boiling proceeds and I continue to ladle boiling sap      from the rear to the front pan, I finally run out of sap,      first in my storage drums and then in the rear pan. Since I      cannot remove the rear pan (doing so would leave a big hole      in the firebox, ruining the draft), I simply shovel snow or      pour water into the back pan when the sap level gets too      low for comfort. The back pan then gives me a handy source      of warm (then hot) water for rinsing my filter felts and      other pieces of equipment.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>But all of a sudden (and I mean sudden), the      foaming bubbles come together and it appears that the<br />      whole batch will boil over.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Never let your pans dry out over the flame. They'll scorch      and be the devil's own to get clean. If a pan is scorched      badly enough, pitch it out. Otherwise, clean it with a      sharp-bladed instrument (putty knife, chisel, or paint      scraper), hot water, a heavy-duty detergent, and a good      scrubber. Some backyard sugarers also recommend adding      white vinegar to the hot water to loosen the burnt sap. In      any event, scrub hard!    </p>    <p>      Keeping an eye on the lowering depth of syrup in the front      pan, the character of the bubbles, and the thermometer, I      begin to let the fire die-maybe push some toward the      back, open the door to let cool air into the firebox, or      even remove an excess log or two. My plan is to get as      close to finished syrup as possible without the batch      boiling over, then ladle and pour it into waiting      half-gallon (two pound) coffee tins.    </p>    <p>      But all of a sudden (and I mean <em>sudden</em> ), the      foaming bubbles in the syrup come together, and the whole      batch starts rising up in the pan, and it appears that it      will boil over-a major crisis in backyard sugarin'.      One solution is to shovel snow directly into the firebox.      It works fine, particularly if you're finished boiling      anyway. Another solution-the time-honored      one-is to touch the surface of the boiling syrup with      a bit of butter on a stick or a piece of bacon. Like oil on      troubled waters, the boiling magically subsides.    </p>    <p>      Finally, I ladle the day's production run into coffee tins,      filtering it as I do so. The syrup has something in it      called niter, which would settle out at the bottom of the      can, make your syrup cloudy, and maybe give it a bitter      taste if not filtered out. In my early sugarin' days I      lined a kitchen strainer with water-resistant paper towels.      They worked fine, but the filtering took forever. So I      acquired a piece of regular filtering felt (available in      most country stores selling sugaring equipment), and I must      say it's far superior to paper toweling. Of course it can      be rinsed out (don't launder it with detergents) and used      over again many times. Before filtering hot syrup through a      felt filter you first have to moisten it with hot water,      and you can rinse it out between pourings to get rid of      accumulated niter.    </p>    <p>      When the syrup level in the front pan gets too low to ladle      conveniently, I simply pick up the whole pan and pour      directly from it. Don't try that too soon. Pouring hot      syrup from a big pan takes some juggling.    </p>    <p>      So now I have six two-pound coffee cans full of red-hot      syrup, and say I'm not exactly sure whether it's      underboiled, just right, or overboiled. What I do is put      the plastic lids on the syrup and head for the kitchen.      There I bring the syrup back up to a boil in a large pot      and check it again carefully with my thermometer and with a      spatula for the aproning effect.    </p>    <p>      To suit my own taste for slightly thicker syrup I make sure      the temperature is high-7°F to 7.5°F over      boiling-water temperature. Dip the spatula in the boiling      syrup and lift it straight up. If the syrup on the spatula      drips off in regular drops, keep boiling. When the drops      begin to hold together and the syrup tends to slide off in      little sheets (or aprons), the batch is ready for canning.      The aproning effect gives you a feeling for the syrup's      consistency, and traditionally it isn't done until it      aprons.    </p>    <h3>Canning and Storage</h3>     <p>      For home packing of syrup I prefer one-pound and two-pound      coffee cans with plastic lids (which come on most coffee      cans these days for resealing). You can save up what you      need during the year, they're very clean (because they've      contained a dry product), and you get a good seal (by using      freezer tape around the plastic top after it is put on).      You can use anything for storing your syrup provided it is      really clean, won't break when you pour hot syrup into it,      and can be sealed. Glass jars with screw-on tops are fine      if the seal in the top is still intact.    </p>    <h3>Musings of a Backyard Sugarer</h3>     <p>      I don't want to get nostalgic or overly philosophical about      sugarin', because it really is a fairly simple,      down-to-earth, and practical procedure which yields a very      useful product that almost everybody enjoys. But I've got      to say that there is something magical about sugarin', and      if you talk with people who make maple syrup, either in a      big commercial evaporator or out in the backyard, you'll      find out there's a lot of agreement on that fact.    </p>    <p>      Maybe it's the time of year-the warm sun climbing      higher into the sky, warming the back after a long winter,      turning the snow into piles of white corn, turning the      brooks from trickles to torrents, starting the maple sap      flowing-a sort of hint of the spring and summer lying      ahead. Maybe it's the drip-drip of sap falling into      buckets, the telltale aroma or the hissing sound of boiling      sap. Maybe it's simply the magic of converting sweet water,      as the Indians used to call it, into delicious golden      syrup. But whatever it is, it's there.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's note: Rink Mann's book, Backyard Sugarin',      from which this is excerpted, expands greatly on the      subject of backyard sugaring.
