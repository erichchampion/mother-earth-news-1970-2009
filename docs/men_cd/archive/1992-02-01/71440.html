                <h5 id="byline">      By Shawna Tracy and Roberta Stauffer    </h5>        <p>      <strong><em>Will freedom from oil dependency happen in our      lifetime?</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      RIGHT NOW, MORE THAN 500 million motor vehicles around the      world are polluting the atmosphere-spewing emissions      equivalent to their weight each year. They foul our air and      poison our rain, and are also a major contributor to the      global-warming effect which is dramatically altering the      world's climate. Americans consume approximately 226      million gallons of gasoline each day. That's 82 billion      gallons each year, 60% of the world's total oil      consumption. And as the crises of the past      year-political and environmental-have shown us,      we need new options.    </p>    <p>      Some answers will be found in a combination of      alternative-fuel vehicles and more-efficient conventional      cars. Technology already exists to power vehicles using      alcohol fuels, electricity, natural gas, propane, and      hydrogen. And vehicles using these propellants are      beginning to show up on the road today in convened fleet      vehicles such as buses, delivery vans, and utility trucks.    </p>    <p>      And as cities like Los Angeles, New York, Denver, Houston,      and Phoenix scramble to comply with the Clean Air Act      legislation, we'll see more fleets-as well as      personal cars-converted in the next few years. Even      more impetus will come from the 1988 Alternative Motor      Fuels Act, intended to increase use of alcohol fuels and      natural gas as energy sources and to spur the production of      vehicles designed to run on them.</p>           <h3>Alcohol Fuels</h3>      <p>      Perhaps the best news about alcohol fuels is that they can      be made from renewable resources such as corn and wood      waste. Researchers are also studying ways to convert      municipal solid waste-especially paper-into an      alcohol fuel.    </p>    <p>      The two most promising alcohol fuels are ethanol and      methanol. Their increased use lessens our dependence on      fossil fuels, and they emit less carbon dioxide and      monoxide and fewer hydrocarbons. The downside is that their      exhaust is not wholly benign: The aldehydes they emit,      including formaldehyde from methanol (a probable human      carcinogen), may require special catalytic converters to      minimize environmental risk.    </p>        <p>      Ethanol is primarily made from corn, though it can be made      from other sources of biomass or from natural gas and crude      oil. The U.S. Department of Energy is focusing its research      on identifying alternative biomass feedstocks for ethanol      since corn is valuable for other uses (and even if the      nation's entire corn harvest were devoted to fuel, it would      supply only 20 percent of our motor-vehicle needs at      current efficiency).    </p>    <p>      Ethanol might now be a new name to some people, since about      8% of the automobile fuel pumped at service stations is      "gasohol"-a gasoline blend containing 10% ethanol.      Between 800 and 850 million gallons of ethanol are produced      in the United States each year, and most of it is blended      with gasoline, though it can be used as a "neat" fuel,      which means "at full strength."<br />      Gasohol is available mainly in the Midwest. You could fill      your car's tank now with the mixture without having to make      any alterations. And only up to $500 worth of adjustments      would have to be made to your car's engine for it to run on      pure ethanol.    </p>    <p>      Methanol, nicknamed "wood alcohol," is most commonly made      from natural gas, though it can be produced from biomass or      coal as well. Approximately 1.4 billion gallons are      produced each year, but only about 530 million gallons, or      38%, are used in fuel applications. (It's primarily used as      a chemical feedstock, extractant, or solvent.)    </p>    <p>      In fuel applications, methanol is used either as a      gasoline-octane enhancer or blended with 15% gasoline to      form a fuel called M85. This fuel is most available in      California and Hawaii-states currently testing      methanol-powered fleets. Converting the rest of the country      to pure methanol would require replacing parts of a car's      fuel tank and distribution system with materials that can      withstand the highly solvent fuel. (Chevron performed tests      on methanol-fueled conventional vehicles and found      decomposing fuel systems and clogged filters.)    </p>    <p>      Practically speaking, the development of alcohol fuels as      alternatives to gasoline is still in its infancy. For them      to make sense environmentally, they should be mass-produced      from a cheap, abundant source of biomass or waste product,      and this segment of the technology remains at the research      stages. Corn is not the ideal feedstock for ethanol, and      large-scale methanol production from fossil fuels would      either mean the eventual importation of natural gas      (continued energy dependence) or increased pollution from      coal production.    </p>    <p>      While research progresses to find economical biomass      feedstocks, we can continue to blend alcohol fuels with      gasoline to reduce emissions and at least lessen our demand      for imported oil. And by the way, it's technically      feasible, if not economical, to produce ethanol or methanol      on a small scale for personal use.    </p>    <h3>Electric Vehicles</h3>    <p>      In this design, a simple, battery-powered electric motor      replaces the complex internal-combustion engine. No exhaust      system pollutes the air. Electric vehicles are on the      market today, and more choices are coming in the next few      years.    </p>    <p>      The future looks bright for electric vehicles. Practically      every major automaker, both foreign and domestic, has some      sort of electric vehicle in the works. The one getting the      most attention is General Motors's Impact-a flashy      two-seater which GM says can go from 0 to 60 mph in eight      seconds and travel 120 miles between charges.    </p>    <p>      GM is also developing an electric van, as are Ford and      Chrysler. Why this seemingly sudden interest in a      century-old technology? California. The country's most      populous state has passed air-quality targets for 1998 that      only the electric vehicle should be able to meet. By that      year, 2% of all new vehicles sold in the state must emit no      air pollutants; by 2003, 10% of all new vehicles sold, or      about 200,000 cars, must meet that standard.    </p>    <p>      Most northeastern states are also expected to pass similar      regulations. As a result, car manufacturers will be      striving to increase the average speed and driving range of      electric vehicles. Cars on the market today can only go an      average of 60 miles at about 35 mph between charges. Higher      speeds and stop-and-go traffic sacrifices driving range,      and recharging (at a standard wall outlet) can take up to      eight hours.    </p>    <p>      The key to making electric cars practical is improved      battery technology. Conventional lead-acid batteries are      the only commercially available ones right now, but new      types such as nickel-iron, nickel-cadmium, sodium-sulfur,      lithium-sulfide, and zinc-air are being developed to      increase the range to 200 miles at a top speed of 70 mph.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Electric cars seem to be a viable solution for      metropolitan areas battling smog. But the<br />      production of electricity is also a major source of      pollution.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      These new batteries are lighter and can store more energy.      They may also last up to 100,000 miles, whereas lead-acid      batteries must be replaced every 20,000 miles at a cost of      $1,500. Each type has its drawbacks, however: Nickel-iron      batteries emit potentially explosive hydrogen gas when      recharging (recharging area must be well-ventilated), and      sodium-sulfur batteries must be kept at extremely high      temperatures (car must be run at least every four days).    </p>    <p>      Another potential solution for short driving ranges is the      electric hybrid vehicle. These contain a small gas engine      that powers a generator to recharge the batteries while the      car is cruising. Such cars could also run on electricity      alone during short trips and to help meet zero-emissions      standards.    </p>    <p>      New cars such as the Impact are expected to cost between      $20.000 and $30,000. A few small companies are now selling      converted electric cars for about $17,000. And you can      purchase do-it-yourself conversion kits for about $7,000.    </p>    <p>      Electric cars seem to be a viable solution for metropolitan      areas battling smog. But this technology isn't totally      pollution-free: Electricity production, especially from      coal, is a major polluter and carbon-dioxide generator.      Renewable energy sources, solar in particular, could at      least augment conventional power production, especially in      sunbelt states like California. Parking lots could be      equipped with solar electric (photovoltaic)      battery-recharging stations, and the cars themselves could      utilize solar panels. Some car ventilation systems are      solar-powered now, but only experimental racing cars are      actually powered by the sun.    </p>    <p>      Other issues needing further attention are crash safety and      the disposal or recycling of spent batteries. Since      batteries contain hazardous materials, both of these issues      are extremely important.    </p>    <h3>Natural-Gas Vehicles</h3>     <p>      Natural gas has become a key contender in the search for      alternative fuels because of its many advantages over      gasoline, including 90% less carbon monoxide and      hydrocarbon emissions, no lead emissions, good cold-start      capability, and smoother operation.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps its greatest advantage is cost. Refueling stations      are selling natural gas for 57 cents per therm, or the      gasoline equivalent of 70 cents per gallon-a savings      of between 30 and 40 cents in most areas.    </p>    <p>      Utilities service most of the 30,000 natural-gas vehicles      operating in the United States today. Most of them are      fleet vehicles supported by their own private refueling      stations. City bus systems, utility company fleets. Postal      Service trucks, and United Parcel Service vans are big      users of natural gas.    </p>    <p>      Of the 308 natural-gas pumps in the United States today,      only a few are open to the public, so there aren't many      personal cars making the switch yet. If your home has      natural gas, you can spend about $3,000 for a unit that      will allow you to refuel in your own backyard. And in      California, Chevron and Pacific Gas & Electric are      installing at least 40 public-refueling stations during      1992.    </p>    <p>      Natural gas is most commonly dispensed in compressed form      (CNG), though it can also be turned into a liquid fuel      (LNG) using high pressure and extreme cold. We'll probably      see more LNG stations in the future because research has      shown that it's more efficient than CNG.    </p>    <p>      Conversion to CNG is relatively simple: It takes less than      a day and costs about $2,000. An aluminum tank is added to      hold the gas, and modifications are made to the fuel      delivery and carburetion systems. Once converted, the car      can run on either gasoline or CNG. Maintenance costs,      however, are lower with CNG use because the fuel doesn't      form sludge, thus keeping the oil, spark plugs, and exhaust      system cleaner.    </p>    <p>      GM trucks built specifically to run on CNG may be on the      market later this year. Production of a CNG-powered Sierra      pickup truck will begin in April, and the company expects      to sell 5,000 of them in 1992. Most sales will be to      utilities in California, Texas, and Colorado, but the      trucks will also be available to the general public.      They'll initially cost between $2,500 and $3,500 more than      their gasoline counterparts.    </p>    <p>      Cars designed to run on CNG will be slower in coming,      mainly because new designs are needed to accommodate the      bulky fuel tank. In converted automobiles, the CNG tank      eats up about half the trunk space. A big tank is needed      because CNG has a lower energy density than gasoline. And      even with the oversize tanks, driving range is only about      150 miles between refills.    </p>    <p>      Natural gas is making inroads into America's transportation      scene mainly because it is cleaner-burning and less      expensive than gasoline. It is still a fossil fuel,      however, so burning it produces carbon dioxide which      contributes to global warming. And though the United States      has an abundance of natural gas right now, we'd have to      import if it became our main transportation fuel.    </p>    <h3>Propane</h3>       <p>      Another fossil fuel-based alternative to gasoline is      liquefied petroleum gas, commonly known as propane. It is a      by-product of natural-gas processing and crude-oil      refining, and like natural gas, it emits less carbon      monoxide and fewer hydrocarbons. It also shares a similar      cost advantage and has a comparable energy density.    </p>    <p>      Propane is more established as an alternative fuel than      natural gas-it's been used this way for 60 years.      Because of its clean-burning properties, it often propels      fork-lifts, stationary engines, and other equipment      operating in enclosed areas. About 350,000 vehicles in the      United States are using it-again, most of them fleet      vehicles. Ten thousand propane retail outlets offer      vehicle-refueling stations, mainly at truckstops, RV      centers, and campgrounds, but not often at regular service      stations. Conoco is the first oil company to begin offering      propane at its service stations, primarily in the Denver      area. The vast majority of propane-powered vehicles are      converted and can also operate on gasoline. The conversion      process is similar to that for natural gas and costs about      as much.    </p>           <p>      Although the United States is one of the world's largest      producers of propane-making about 20 billion gallons      a year- only 2% is used for transportation. The      remainder is used for home heating and to make products      such as pesticides, synthetic fiber, rubber, antifreeze,      and solvents. The demand for it in these non-transportation      areas is probably the major reason it's not getting as much      attention as the other alternative fuels. Also, available      quantities of propane are limited by natural gas and oil      production, since it's a byproduct of these processes.    </p>    <h3>Hydrogen</h3>      <p>      In the 1930s, scientists in England and Germany converted      over 1,000 test vehicles to operate on hydrogen and      hydrogen/gasoline mixtures. Today, NASA uses hydrogen to      fuel space shuttles and rockets.    </p>    <p>      Hydrogen fuel seems ideal because the only by-products of      combustion are water and a manageable amount of nitrogen      oxide. It can be burned in standard internal-combustion      engines, and we appear to have a limitless supply from a      renewable source-water.    </p>    <p>      But if only it were that simple! Since pure hydrogen does      not exist in a natural state, it must be extracted from      other materials. Hydrogen is now produced most economically      from natural gas, and, in the process, as much carbon      dioxide is released as if the natural gas were burned.      Another extraction option is electrolysis, or using an      electric current to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.      This option, while technically sound, isn't economically      feasible at current electricity rates. (And it raises the      question: Why use electricity to create hydrogen when      electricity itself is an emissionless alternative fuel?)    </p>    <p>      Once extracted, hydrogen storage poses further difficulties      because it's a dangerous gas with a low energy density.      It's most commonly stored in metal cylinders in highly      compressed form, but this method isn't practical for      vehicles because the tanks are too heavy and bulky.      Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) has developed a working      prototype using liquid storage: The gas is liquefied at      -423°F and placed in superinsulated vacuum tanks.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the safest method of storage uses metal-hydride      technology. The tank contains combinations of metals (in      powder form) that have a strong attraction to the hydrogen,      actually trapping it in their crystalline structures.      Mercedes-Benz has been researching this technique. However,      an 800-pound tank holds only the equivalent of four gallons      of gasoline. Hydrides using superactivated carbon may      double the storage capacity of this method, but it still      won't provide driving ranges comparable to gasoline.    </p>    <p>      Another option for hydrogen as a transportation fuel is to      use a hydrogen-powered fuel cell to generate electricity to      power the car. A New Jersey company is developing a      prototype of this option, which would make the driving      range of electric cars comparable to that of conventional      vehicles.    </p>    <p>      Large-scale hydrogen use probably won't commence until the      fuel can be produced economically using renewable energy      (solar or wind). A prototype solar-powered hydrogen plant      using water electrolysis is being built in Riverside,      California, and another is near completion in Germany.    </p>    <h3>What the Future Holds</h3>       <p>      It's nice to know there are so many viable options to      gasoline and that the majority of them could be made from      renewable resources. Renewable fuels are important not only      for energy sustainability, but also to slow global warming.      There's no escaping carbon-dioxide emissions when burning      fossil fuels-oil, natural gas, and coal-no      matter how efficient they burn. Carbon dioxide is also      created when methanol and ethanol are produced and burned,      but if they are made from grain or woody materials, the      next crop reabsorbs an equal amount of carbon dioxide, so      there is no net increase to the atmosphere.    </p>    <p>      Though vital to our future, none of these alternatives will      <em>totally</em> replace gasoline, at least not in our      lifetime. The massive infrastructural changes necessary to      totally switch are mind-boggling, and we probably couldn't      make enough of any one option to satisfy our needs.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Shawna Tracy is an information      specialist and Roberta Stauffer is a technical writer for      NATAS, the National Appropriate Technology Assistance      Service.
