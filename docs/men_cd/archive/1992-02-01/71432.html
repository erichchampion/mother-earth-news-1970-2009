            		        <p><strong>      How to turn spare parts into decorative      wind-pointers. </strong></p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Lynden O. Hare    </h5>        <p class="credit">      PHOTOGRAPH Â© LYNDEN O. HARE    </p>    <p>      I'D BEEN IMPRESSED FOR YEARS BY<br />      weather vanes I'd seen around the country. And for years      the large barns on our farms in southern Oregon had gone      undressed, so to speak. So one day I decided to fire up my      welder and build a vane from the junk I had lying around      the ranch. As I have one of the finest collections of junk      in the area-much to the dismay of my wife-I had      and have plenty to choose from.    </p>    <p>      Well, to get to the construction: The first thing to build      was a base that would fit the peak of the barn. The base      was an old piece of 3" angle iron about 4' long with two      pieces of bed-rail angle iron 2' long welded perpendicular      to the center. As our barn is oriented true north and      south, I simply cut out letters for each wind direction      from an old truck hood and welded them to the appropriate      piece of angle iron, according to the way it would sit atop      the barn. I welded two braces to the center of the base to      stabilize and secure it to the roof. It is important that      the base be level so that the center of gravity is      perfectly centered.    </p>    <p>      The next step is to weld or attach an old front-wheel      spindle to the center of the base. This is what the upper      part of the vane will rotate on. A front-wheel spindle and      hub, properly packed with grease, is probably the best set      of bearings you could obtain for this purpose and will last      for years with little or no maintenance. I then cut out the      center of an old wheel that matches the bolt pattern of the      hub. The upper part of the vane will be mounted on this, as      it allows the weather vane to be bolted together into two      parts for ease of installation.    </p>    <p>      Weld a short piece of hollow driveline, with the solid      spline shaft part pointed upward, to the wheel center.      Tack-weld a good secondhand thro-out bearing around the      spline shaft that will carry the wind cups. The bearing      will allow the wind cups to rotate independent of the rest      of the vane. It is important to mount the cups on a ring      that clamps to the bearing, either by bent tabs or bolts,      as welding them to the bearing itself will warp and ruin      it.    </p>    <p>      I made cones out of old water-heater jacket tin and then      welded them to push rods which were in turn welded to the      ring. After I mounted the wind cups assembly to the spline      shaft. I cut a hole in an old moon hubcap and mounted it      over the thro-out bearing to keep out moisture. The bearing      should be well lubricated with a very light grease so it      will rotate with the slightest breeze. Then to the top of      the spline shaft I welded an old low-tempered buzz-saw      blade. (A high-tempered blade will crack when welded on.)      Weld the arrow, which is made out of bed-rail angle iron      and sheet metal from a junk-car body, horizontal to this.      The rooster (or whatever symbol you decide to use) mounted      on the top is fashioned in the same manner. It is important      to mount the vane securely and level so it will rotate      properly. And-as with any type of roof      work-extreme caution should be taken when installing      the vane!    </p>    <p>      Our barn sits right next to the highway that leads to the      Oregon Caves National Monument, and someone is always      stopping to take pictures of the vane. Soon after I put up      the first vane I built, a tourist from Los Angeles rolled      his station wagon into my barnyard and demanded that I take      it down. I asked him what he was talking about. He said,      "Name your price-I want to buy it." Well, I named my      price and now it's somewhere in North Hollywood, blowing in      the Santa Ana wind. Since then, I have sold three or four      and could have sold more.    </p>    <p>      I sold another to a local rancher who raises Black Angus      cattle, and have orders for several more-if I ever      get the time to build them. But anyone with a welder and a      torch can put one together, so I hope to see vanes popping      up on buildings all over the country.    </p>
