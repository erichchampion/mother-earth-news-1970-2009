                <h5 id="byline">      By Louise Riotte    </h5>        <p>      <strong>The A to Z Guide to Companion Planting for      Healthier Plants and Bigger Harvests</strong>    </p>        <p>      THE MAGIC AND MYSTERY OF companion planting has intrigued      and fascinated men for centuries, yet it is a part of the      gardening world that has never been fully explored. Plants      that assist each other in growing well, that repel insects,      or that even repel other plants are all of great practical      use, but we're just beginning to find out why. In the years      to come I hope scientists, gardeners, and farmers      everywhere will work together to make discoveries that will      prove of great value in augmenting the world's food supply.      Already, companion planting has produced insect- and      disease-resistant fruits, grains, and vegetables, and      experiments are being conducted on weed-resistant      varieties.    </p>    <p>      A major enemy of the carrot is the carrot fly, whereas the      leek suffers from the leek moth and the onion fly. Yet when      they live in companionship, the strong and strangely      different smell of the partner plant repels the insects so      well that they do not even attempt to lay their eggs on the      neighbor plant. This is why mixed plantings give better      insect control than a monoculture where many plants of the      same type are planted together in row after row.    </p>    <p>      It's the same with kohlrabi and radishes in their community      life with lettuce. Both are often afflicted by earth flies,      but when the flies get the odor of lettuce they take off.      Even when plants are affected by diseases one can usually      alleviate the situation with a mixed plant culture.    </p>    <p>      All through this article you will find "what to grow with"      and "what <em>not</em> to grow with." Both are equally      important to gardening success. The following suggestions      for companion planting are only a beginning. Your own      experiments will lead you toward many different pathways      and discoveries.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Asparagus</strong> ( <em>Asparagus officinalis</em>      ). Parsley planted alongside asparagus gives added vigor to      both. Asparagus also goes well with basil, which itself is      a good companion for tomatoes. Tomatoes will protect      asparagus against asparagus beetles because they contain a      substance called solanine. But if asparagus beetles are      present in great numbers, they will attract and be      controlled by their natural predators, making spraying      unnecessary. A chemical derived from asparagus juice also      has been found effective on tomato plants as a killer of      nematodes, including the root-knot sting, stubby root, and      meadow varieties.    </p>        <p>      In my garden, I grow asparagus in a long row at one side.      After the spears are harvested in early spring, I plant      tomatoes on either side, and I find that both plants      prosper from the association. Cultivating the tomatoes also      stems weed growth around the asparagus. The asparagus      fronds should not be cut much, if at all, until very late      in the fall, as the roots need this top growth to enable      them to make spears the following spring.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bean</strong> ( <em>Phaselolus and Vicia</em> ).      Many different kinds of beans have been developed, each      with its own life of "good" and "bad" companions. Generally      speaking, however, all will thrive when interplanted with      carrots and cauliflower; carrots especially help the beans      to grow. Beans also grow well with beets as well as      cucumbers and cabbages.    </p>    <p>      A moderate quantity of beans planted with leek and celeriac      will help all, but planted too thickly they have an      inhibiting effect-causing poor growth for all three.      Marigolds in bean rows help repel the Mexican bean beetle.    </p>    <p>      Planting summer savory with green beans improves their      growth and flavor as well as deterring bean beetles. (It is      also good to <em>cook</em> with beans.)    </p>    <p>      Beans are inhibited by any member of the onion      family-garlic, shallots, or chives-and they      also dislike being planted near gladiolus.    </p>    <p>      Broad beans are excellent companions to corn, climbing      diligently up the corn stalks to reach the light. They not      only anchor the corn more firmly, acting as a protection      against the wind, but a heavy vine growth may also act as a      deterrent to raccoons. In addition, beans provide the soil      with nitrogen, which enriches corn growth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bean and Potato</strong> . Bush beans planted with      potatoes protect them against the Colorado potato beetle.      In return, the potatoes protect the bush beans from the      Mexican bean beetle. It is considered best to plant the      beans and potatoes in alternate rows.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bean, Bush</strong> ( <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>      ). Included with bush beans are those known as butter,      green, snap, string, or wax. All will do well if planted      with a moderate amount of celery (about one celery plant to      every six or seven of beans).    </p>    <p>      Bush beans and cucumbers are mutually beneficial. Bush      beans planted with straw berries also help one another,      both advancing more rapidly than if planted alone.    </p>    <p>      One gardener believes that celery is benefited if grown in      a circle so that the lacy, loosely interwoven roots make a      more desirable home for earth-worms and soil microbes.    </p>    <p>      Bush beans will aid corn if planted in alternate rows. They      grow well with summer savory but should never be planted      near fennel. They also dislike onions, as do all beans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bean, Lima</strong> ( <em>Phaselous limensis</em>      ). Nearby locust trees have a good effect on the growth of      lima beans. Other plants give them little or no assistance      in repelling insects. Never cultivate lima beans when they      are wet, because if anthracnose is present, this will cause      it to spread. If the ground has sufficient lime and      phosphorous there will probably be little trouble from      anthracnose and mildew.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bean, Pole</strong> . Like others of the family,      pole beans do well with corn and summer savory but they      also have some pronounced dislikes, such as kohlrabi and      sunflower. Beets do not grow well with them, but radishes      and pole beans seem to derive mutual benefit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bee Balm</strong> ( <em>Monarda</em> ). Improves      both the growth and flavor of tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Beet</strong> ( <em>Beta vulgaris</em> ). Beets      grow well near bush beans, onions, or kohlrabi but are      "turned off by pole beans. Field mustard and charlock also      inhibit the growth of beets. Lettuce and most members of      the cabbage family are "friendly" to them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Broccoli</strong> ( <em>Brassica oeraceae</em> ).      Like all members of the cabbage family, broccoli does well      with such aromatic plants as dill, celery, chamomile. sage.      peppermint, rosemary, and with other vegetables such as      potatoes, beets, and onions. Do not plant it with tomatoes,      pole beans, or strawberries. Use pyrethrum against aphids      but only before the flower buds open.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cabbage</strong> ( <em>Brassicaceae</em> ). The      cabbage family includes not only cabbage but cauliflower,      kale, kohlrabi, broccoli, collards, and Brussels      sprouts-even rutabagas and turnips. While each plant      of this group has been developed in a special way, they are      all pretty much subject to the same likes and dislikes,      insects and diseases. Hyssop, thyme, wormwood, and      southernwood are helpful in repelling the white cabbage      butterfly.    </p>    <p>      All members of this family are greatly helped by aromatic      plants, or those which have many blossoms, such as celery,      dill, chamomile, sage, peppermint, rosemary, onions, and      potatoes.    </p>    <p>      If rabbits dig in your cabbage patch, plant any member of      the onion family alongside them. Or you can dust with      ashes. powdered aloes, or cayenne pepper. Rabbits also shun      dried blood or blood meal.    </p>    <p>      Butterflies themselves aren't harmful and can help      pollinate plants. It is their hatched eggs which as      caterpillars do such damage to the orchard and field crops.      The white cabbage butterfly is perhaps the most      destructive. Herbs will repel them: hyssop, peppermint,      rosemary, sage, thyme, and southernwood.    </p>    <p>      Cabbages dislike strawberries, tomatoes, and pole beans.      All members of the family are heavy feeders and should have      plenty of compost or well-decomposed cow manure worked into      the ground previous to planting. Mulching will help if the      soil has a tendency to dry out in hot weather, and water      should be given if necessary.    </p>    <p>      Cabbage and cauliflower are subject to clubroot. and if      this occurs try planting in new soil in a different pan of      the garden. Rotate cabbage crops every two years.    </p>    <p>      If cabbage or broccoli plants do not head up well, it is a      sign that lime, phosphorus, or potash is needed. Boron      deficiency may cause the heart of the cabbage to die out.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Celery</strong> ( <em>Apium graveolens</em> ).      Celery grows well with leeks, tomatoes, cauliflower, and      cabbage, while bush beans and celery seem to provide mutual      assistance. One gardener believes that celery is      particularly benefited if grown in a circle so that the      lacy, loosely interwoven roots may make a more desirable      home for earthworms and soil microbes. Celery and leeks      both grow well when trenched. Both celery and celeriac are      reported to have a hormone which has an effect similar to      insulin, making them an excellent seasoning for diabetics      or for anyone on a salt-reduced diet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Corn</strong> ( <em>Zea mays</em> ). Sweet corn      does well with potatoes, peas, beans, cucumbers, pumpkin,      and squash. Research has shown that removing corn suckers      is a waste of time as well as being detrimental to the      development of the ears. Peas and beans help corn by      restoring to the soil the nitrogen used up by the corn. Is      there anyone who hasn't heard the story of Indians putting      a fish in every corn hill?    </p>    <p>      MeMelons, squash, pumpkins, and cucumbers like the shade      provided by corn. In turn they benefit the corn, protecting      it from the depredations of raccoons, which do not like to      travel through the thick vines. Similarly, pole beans may      be planted with corn to climb on the stalks. But don't      plant tomatoes near corn, because the tomato worm and corn      earworm are identical.    </p>    <p>      Also of note: An experiment with <em>odorless</em> marigold      showed that when it was planted next to corn the Japanese      beetle did not chew off the corn silks.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cucumber</strong> ( <em>Cucumis sativus</em> ).      Cucumbers apparently are offensive to raccoons, so it's      beneficial to plant it alongside corn. And corn seemingly      protects the cucumbers against the virus that causes wilt.      Thin strips of cucumber will repel ants.    </p>    <p>      Cucumbers also like beans, peas, radishes, and sunflowers,      and-preferring some shade-they will grow well      in young orchards. Sow two or three radishes, but let them      grow as long as they will, even blossoming and going to      seed. Cucumber beetles also may be trapped by filling      shallow containers about three-quarters full of water into      which some cooking oil has been poured.    </p>    <p>      If cucumbers are attacked by nematodes, try a sugar spray.      I boil half a cup of sugar in two cups of water, stirring      until completely dissolved. Let cool and dilute with a      gallon of water. Strange as it seems, sugar kills nematodes      by drying them out. This will also attract      honeybees-insuring pollination and resulting in a      bumper crop of cucumbers-so the spray is worth trying      even if you don't suspect the presence of nematodes.    </p>    <p>      Cucumbers dislike potatoes, while potatoes grown near      cucumbers are more likely to be affected by phytophthora      blight, so keep the two apart.    </p>    <p>      Beneficial fungi are another enemy of nematodes. If you      suspect their presence, build up the humus content of your      soil. A chive spray is helpful for downy mildew on      cucumbers as is a spray made of horsetail.    </p>    <p>      Cucumbers dislike potatoes, while potatoes grown near      cucumbers are more likely to be affected by phytophthora      blight, so keep the two apart. Cucumbers also have a      dislike for aromatic herbs.    </p>    <p>      Plant scientists William Duke, of Cornell, and Alan Putnam,      of Michigan State University, have discovered that certain      cucumber varieties fight weeds by releasing a toxic      substance. This natural process-allelopathy-is      believed to be an inherited trait. Thus, attempts are being      made to incorporate weed resistance into commercial crops      much in the same way as insect and disease resistance is      bred into plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Eggplant</strong> ( <em>Solanum melongena</em> ).      Redroot pigweed makes eggplant more resistant to insect      attack. During dry weather, mulching and irrigation will      help prevent wilt disease. Dry cayenne pepper sprinkled on      plants while still wet with dew will repel caterpillars.      Eggplant growing among green beans will be protected from      the Colorado potato beetle. The beetles like eggplant even      more than potatoes, but they find the beans repellent.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Garlic</strong> ( <em>Allium sativum</em> ). Eldon      L. Reeves and S. V. Amonkar, of the University of      California, discovered garlic to be a powerful destroyer of      mosquitoes, achieving a 100% mortality of five species of      California mosquito larvae by spraying breeding ponds with      a garlic-based oil.    </p>    <p>      Researcher David Greenstock, of the Henry Doubleday      Research Association in England, found that a garlic-oil      emulsion, used as an insecticide, killed 89% of aphids and      95% of onion flies.    </p>    <p>      Here's a recipe for a good garlic spray: Take 3 to 4 ounces      of chopped garlic bulbs and soak in 2 tablespoons of      mineral oil for one day. Add a pint of water in which 1      teaspoon of fish emulsion has been dissolved. Stir well.      Strain the liquid and store in a glass or china container,      as it reacts with metals. Dilute this, starting with 1 part      to 20 parts of water, and use as a spray against your worst      insect pests. If sweet potatoes or other garden plants are      attracting rabbits, try this spray. Rabbits dislike the      smell of fish, too. Garlic sprays are useful in controlling      late blight on tomatoes and potatoes.    </p>    <p>      Garlic grown in a circle around fruit trees is good against      borers. It is beneficial to the growth of vetch, protects      roses, and, when cloves are stored in grain, will repell      grain weevils. All <em>alliums</em> , however, inhibit the      growth of peas and beans. Plant garlic with tomatoes to      protect against red spiders. I have done this for three      successive years, with good results.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kohlrabi</strong> ( <em>Brassicaceae</em> ).      Kohlrabi grown with onion or beets, with aromatic plants,      and, surprisingly, with cucumbers, are mutually beneficial      in part because they occupy different soil strata. Kohlrabi      dislikes strawberries, tomatoes, and pole beans but helps      protect mustard family members.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Leek</strong> ( <em>Allium porrum</em> ). Leek is a      heavy feeder and should be planted in soil well-fertilized      with rotted manure. Leeks are usually sold in the grocery      store (at least where I live) with the roots still      attached. I once bought several bunches and planted them;      they grew well and propagated, and I've had leeks ever      since.    </p>    <p>      Leeks are good plants to grow with celery and onions, and      also are benefited by carrots. Returning the favor, leeks      repel carrot flies.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lettuce:</strong> ( <em>Lactuca saliva</em> ) In      spring I kep a supply of small lettuce plants growing in      cold frames. When I pull every other green onion for table      use I pop in lettuce plants. They will aid the onions, and      the compost in the onion row will still be in good supply      for the lettuce to feed on, while the onion will repel any      rabbits.    </p>    <p>      Lettuce grows well with strawberries, cucumbers, and      carrots, and it has long been considered good to team with      radishes. Radishes grown with lettuce in summer are      particularly succulent.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Okra</strong> ( <em>Hibiscus esculentus</em> ).      This native of the Old-World tropics is grown for its      immature pods, which are called okra or gumbo. It's a      warm-weather plant which grows wherever melons or cucumbers      thrive. I plant two rows, dig a trench between, and cover      it with mulch. On the north side of my okra, I plant a row      of sweet bell peppers and on the south side a row of      eggplant. All are well mulched as the season advances. When      the weather becomes dry in midsummer I lay the hose in the      trench and flood it so that all three companions grow well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Onion</strong> (Allium cepa). Onions and all      members of the cabbage family get along well with each      other. They also like beets, strawberries, tomatoes,      lettuce, summer savory, and chamomile (sparsely), but do      <em>not</em> like peas and beans.    </p>    <p>      Since onion maggots travel from plant to plant when set in      a row, scatter your onion plants throughout the garden.    </p>    <p>      Toxic substances in the pigments of red and yellow onion      skins appear to be associated with disease resistance.      Russian biologist T. A. Tovstole found a water solution of      onion skin-used as a spray three times daily at      five-day intervals-gave an almost 100% mortality of      hemitera, a parasite attacking more than 100 different      species of plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Parsley</strong> ( <em>Petroselinum hortense</em>      ). Parsley mixed with carrot seed helps to repel carrot      flies by its masking aroma. It protects roses against rose      beetles. Planted with tomatoes or asparagus, parsley will      give added vigor to both.    </p>    <p>      Poultry are sometimes turned loose at intervals in parsley      patches where there are many parsley worms, which are the      larvae of the black swallowtail butterfly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Parsnip</strong> ( <em>Pastinuca sativa</em> ) The      parsnip is of ancient culture, but remains a vegetable for      the discerning palate. The parsnips have few insect enemies      and suffer from few diseases, but both the foliage and      roots make a safe insect spray. They are not injured by      freezing and are often left in the ground over winter. The      seeds germinate slowly and unevenly and should not be used      if over a year old.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pea</strong> ( <em>Pisum sativum</em> ). For large      crops, inoculate pea and bean seed with Nitragen (or      similar compound), which is a natural bacterial agent. It      coats the seed, aiding the sprouting seedling. This enables      the plant to more readily form nodules on the roots which      convert nitrogen from the air into a compound the plant can      use.    </p>    <p>      Peas grow well with carrots, turnips, radishes, cucumbers,      corn, beans, and potatoes, as well as many aromatic herbs.      They do not grow well with onions, garlic, and gladiolus.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pumpkin</strong> ( <em>Cucurhita pepo</em> ).      Pumpkins grow well when jimson weed, sometimes called thorn      apple, is in the vicinity. Pumpkins grow well with corn (a      practice followed by Native Americans), yet pumpkins and      potatoes have an inhibiting effect on each other.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Radish</strong> ( <em>Rubus</em> ). If you grow      both red and black raspberries, put a considerable distance      between the two types. The reason for this is that the reds      sometimes carry a disease which does little or no harm to      themselves but may prove near fatal to the blacks. Do not      grow raspberries and blackberries near each other, either.      Potatoes are more susceptible to blight if grown near      raspberries, many gardeners believe.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Spinach</strong> ( <em>Spinacia oleracea</em> ).      Because of its saponin content, spinach is a useful      pre-crop and does well planted with strawberries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Squash</strong> ( <em>Curcubitaceae</em> ). Two or      three icicle radishes planted in each hill will help      prevent insects on squash and on cucumbers. Let the      radishes grow and go to seed. Nasturtiums will repel squash      bugs and so will cigarette ash and other tobacco residue if      placed with the seed when it is planted. Squash planted      either earlier or later than usual often will escape insect      damage. I find fall-planted squash almost entirely      insect-free.    </p>    <p>      Early in the day before the sun is strong, squash stinkbugs      are sluggish, and in the small garden may be picked off.      There are also insect-resistant strains of squash      available.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sweet Potato</strong> ( <em>Ipomea batalas</em> ).      Nemagold sweet potatoes developed by the Oklahoma      Experiment Station have built-in resistance to nematodes.      Sweet potatoes generally have high-energy value, with only      peas and beans yielding more. They have a common      enemy-the fungus disease or wilt called "stem      rot"-which can be controlled with disease-free seed      and by rotating the crop. White hellebore controls a number      of leaf-eating insects.    </p>    <p>      If rabbits bother your sweet-potato patch, spray with a      diluted fish emulsion. (Parks has one called Mer-Made Fish      Emulsion.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tomato</strong> ( <em>Lycopersicon esculentum</em>      ). Tomatoes will protect asparagus against the asparagus      beetle. Since they are tender plants, put tomatoes in      during late spring after the early crop of asparagus spears      has been harvested. Tomatoes and all members of the      <em>Brassica</em> family repel each other and should be      kept apart. Tomatoes protect gooseberries against insects.    </p>    <p>      Tomatoes are compatible with chives, onion, parsley,      marigold, nasturtium, and carrot, and for several years I      have planted garlic bulbs between my tomato plants to      protect them from red spider mites. Though not containing      fungicidal elements, tomatoes will protect roses against      black spot.    </p>        <p>      The active principle of tomato leaves is solanine, a      volatile alkaloid that at one time was used as an      agricultural insecticide. You can create your own      insect-repellent spray for roses by making a solution of      tomato leaves in your vegetable juicer-add 4 or 5      pints of water and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Strain and      spray on roses where it is not convenient to plant tomatoes      as companions. Keep any unused spray refrigerated.    </p>    <p>      Unlike most other vegetables, tomatoes prefer to grow in      the same place year after year, and this is all right      unless you have a disease problem, in which case plant your      tomatoes in a new area. Stinging nettle growing nearby      improves their keeping qualities, and redroot pigweed, in      small quantities, is beneficial, too. Tomatoes are      inhibited by the presence of kohlrabi and fennel.    </p>    <p>      Root excretions of tomatoes have an inhibiting effect on      young apricot trees. Don't plant tomatoes near corn, since      the tomato fruitworm is identical to the corn earworm.      Don't plant near potatoes, either, since tomatoes render      them more susceptible to potato blight.    </p>    <p>      If you smoke, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before      you work in your garden, for tomatoes are susceptible to      diseases transmitted through tobacco.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Turnip/Rutabaga</strong> ( <em>Brassica rapa and      Brassica napobrassica</em> ). An accident revealed that      hairy vetch and turnips are excellent companions. Turnip      seeds became mixed with the vetch a gardener planted, and      they came up as volunteer plants. He found the turnip      greens completely free of the aphids which usually infest      them, apparently because the vetch provided shelter for      ladybugs, which feast on aphids. Elsewhere it has been      found that wood ashes around the base of turnip plants will      control scab.    </p>    <p>      I find peas planted near turnips are mutually benefited.      Turnip and radish seed mixed with clover will bolster the      nitrogen content of the soil. In your crop rotation it is      good to follow the heavy feeders with light feeders such as      turnips and rutabagas.    </p>    <p>      Turnips dislike hedge mustard and knotweed, and should not      be rotated with other members of the cabbage family such as      broccoli or kohlrabi. When synthesized, a naturally      occuring chemical compound in turnips when synthesized is      deadly to aphids, spider mites, houseflies, German      cockroaches, and bean beetles.    </p>    <p>      Rutabagas take much the same culture as turnips but require      a longer growing season.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        DISEASE-AND WEATHER-RESISTANT VEGETABLE VARIETIES      </h3>      <p>        <strong>ASPARAGUS:</strong> <em>Mary Washington</em> ,        rustresistant (Farmers).<br />        <strong>BEAN:</strong> <em>Topcrop, Tendercrop,        Harvester</em> , mosaic-resistant (Twilley Seed Co.).
