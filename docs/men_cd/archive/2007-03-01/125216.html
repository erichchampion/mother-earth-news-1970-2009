        Hardwood flooring has long been a popular choice among homeowners.It's beautiful, easy to clean, and unlike carpet, doesn't harborharmful chemicals, dirt or dust mites that can affect indoor airquality. Properly installed, high-quality hardwood floors can lastfor decades, and even add value to a home.<br /><br />If you're considering a new hardwood floor, but want to stay trueto your earth-friendly ideals, you're in luck ? there's a long listof sustainable hardwood flooring products to choose from. We'veassembled a few to get you started. Keep reading for a list ofcompanies that provide them.<br /><br />?<b>Certified Wood Flooring</b><br />The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is a nonprofit group thatpromotes environmentally responsible forestry practices. Companiescan offer peace of mind to consumers by displaying the FSC's stampof approval, which is awarded by third-party organizations thatensure certain stewardship standards have been met.<br /><br />You don't have to sacrifice your options when you chooseresponsibly. A wide range of flooring woods come with the FSCstamp, including cherry, maple, birch, ash, Douglas fir, oak andmore.<br /><br />?<b>Reclaimed Wood Flooring</b><br />As the name implies, timber salvaged from old buildings, riverbottoms, or even trees removed from urban settings can become yournew hardwood floor. The finished product can have either a like-newor antique appearance, and comes in a variety of lengths andwidths. Availability can be unpredictable, so plan as far inadvance as possible.<br /><br />?<b>Suppressed Wood Flooring</b><br />From time to time, a forest can become overly dense, resulting indisease and fire susceptibility. Small trees in the forest'sunderstory are the casualties of the unavoidable thinning-outprocess, but there's good news: They make excellent hardwoodfloors.<br /><br />?<b>Less Expensive Wood Flooring</b><br />Some softwoods, such as pine or spruce, also make excellentlower-cost floors.
