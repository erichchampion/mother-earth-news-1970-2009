        Thanks to thousands of growers in Chile, Central America, Mexico and the United States, we all enjoy a wide assortment of berries (and prices, depending on the season) throughout the year. What many of us have forgotten in this abundance of choices and availability is the stunning flavor of natural, truly fresh berries. Fresh as in just picked, 10 or two minutes ago, perhaps by your own hand. Once you're reacquainted with these delicious, organic treats, the taste of mass-produced, far-traveling versions pales in comparison.<br /><br />Varieties of wild berries grow all over North America, making berry-picking a fun adventure and savory pleasure any of us can enjoy. As you head out, keep in mind these tips to help you in the hunt and stay smart when recognizing which berries are safe and which to avoid.<br /><br />Check out a good field guide. Two great guides have the same title: <i>Edible Wild Plants, A North American Field Guide</i> by Elias and Dykeman (both Ph.D. botanists) and <i>Edible Wild Plants</i> by Lee Peterson, which includes Lee's excellent line drawings. Regional guides are another important resource. (See John Vivian's article, <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/1999-10-01/Field-Guide-To-Wild-Berries.aspx" target="_blank">Field Guide to Wild Berries,</a> for additional suggestions.)<br /><br />Your best bet is to make the first couple expeditions with an experienced berry-picker from the area. He or she will know where to look, what to look for and what's ok to eat.<br /><br />Berries like plenty of sun for growing and appear from ground level on up to eye level. Often growing in bushes or creepers, even their trees are low-growers. The edges of roads, fields and meadows often sport berries, as well as the interior of naturally occurring meadows and along ponds and river edges. You'll find that most berries are ready in the summer, though some appear in the spring and fall.<br /><br />Just some of the berries found in Central and Eastern North America include blackberries, raspberries, wineberries, dewberries, huckleberries, elderberries, wild cherries, cranberries, serviceberries and barberries, among others. (See <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/1999-10-01/Edible-Wild-Plants.aspx?page=3" target="_blank">Common Wild Berries of Central and Eastern North America</a> for an extended list, as well as picking tips and safety information.)<br /><br />Finally, three important warnings:<br /><br />Always confirm the identity of the berry before you pick or eat anything. Familiarize yourself with a good field guide. This is where a veteran berry-picker becomes an invaluable resource.<br /><br />Don't pick or eat berries from areas where herbicide has recently been used. If a clean line of vegetation is dead, or growing but clearly lagging behind neighboring plants, move on and try the area again next year.<br /><br />Make noise. Bears and other critters love berries, and surprising them could prove unpleasant for both of you.<br /><br />Learn more about berry-picking, field guide resources, types of berries and important related information in <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/1999-10-01/Field-Guide-To-Wild-Berries.aspx" target="_blank">Field Guide to Wild Berries</a> from <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i></a> magazine.<br /><br /><br />
