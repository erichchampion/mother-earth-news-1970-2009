        <p>Almost everyone gets headaches. The good news is that many natural remedies can reduce headache pain and better yet, prevent it.</p><h3>Nutritional Supplements</h3><p>Small clinical trials support the use of three supplements to thwart headache pain: magnesium, riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10.</p><p><strong>Magnesium.</strong> Research shows that intravenous magnesium helps break migraine and cluster headaches (rare, severe and primarily afflict men), particularly in those with low levels of this mineral. Other trials also have shown that oral magnesium may help prevent headaches. Magnesium deficiency is particularly common in women with menstrual migraines. Patients with migraines can take 400 to 600 milligrams a day of magnesium oxide, as this form is effective and inexpensive.</p><p><strong>Riboflavin.</strong> The research on riboflavin is less extensive, but nonetheless encouraging. In an open-label trial (no placebo control group), 400 milligrams a day for six months cut migraine headache frequency in half and decreased medication use. Another study showed that three months of riboflavin led to a 50 percent improvement in almost 60 percent of the volunteers, versus a 15 percent improvement over the people taking a dummy pill.</p><p><strong>Coenzyme Q10.</strong> This a vitaminlike substance participates in mitochondrial energy production. When 42 migraine sufferers took either coenzyme Q10 (100 milligrams three times a day) or a placebo, the supplement significantly reduced the frequency of attacks.</p><h3>Helpful Herbs</h3><p><strong>Feverfew</strong> looks like a tiny daisy and, in fact, comes from the same tribe of plants (Asteraceae). Out of eight studies on feverfew’s ability to prevent migraines, most found some degree of benefit. In a recent, well-designed clinical trial, 170 German patients took a placebo pill or an extract of feverfew for 16 weeks. Those taking feverfew had significantly fewer migraines. Feverfew is usually taken daily to prevent, rather than treat, migraines. If you do take feverfew long-term, know that there have been some reports of rebound headaches upon discontinuing the herb. Herbal experts often recommend tapering off the dose.</p><p><strong>Butterbur</strong> also is a member of the Asteraceae family. Traditionally used to treat spasms in the respiratory and digestive tract, the leaves and rhizomes contain petasin, which relaxes smooth muscle tissue and also inhibits the formation of inflammatory substances called leukotrienes. The plant also contains liver toxins called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), so it’s important to choose a formula that's PA-free. Three clinical trials (including one in children and teens) have shown that this herb, taken preventively, safely and effectively reduces the number of migraines. Benefits become obvious at about four weeks.</p>
