        <p>Ginger is a great remedy for motion sickness and troubled tummies. Cultivated for millennia in the Far East, this useful root was approved by the <a href="http://content.herbalgram.org/ogdenpress/CommissionE/default.asp?p=830" target="_blank">German Commission E</a> to prevent motion sickness and dyspepsia. (Commission E was established by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in the 70s to review herbal remedies.)</p><p>Gingerâ€™s anti-inflammatory properties also have been shown to improve joint pain associated with arthritis. And its blood-thinning properties also may help reduce cholesterol levels by stimulating the secretion of bile and hindering fat absorption, says <a href="http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/syllabus/instructor.htm" target="_blank">James A. Duke</a>, Ph.D., in his book, <em>The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook</em>.</p><p>In <em>The Herbal Drugstore</em>, Linda White, M.D., recommends ingesting ginger in one of the following forms:</p><ul><li>Fresh root</li><li>Teas</li><li>Capsules</li><li>Tablets</li><li>Tinctures</li><li>Liquid extracts</li><li>Candied slices (See our previous <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/issues/motherearthliving/whole_foods/Candied-Ginger_76-1.html" target="_blank">Candied Ginger recipe</a>.)</li></ul><p>Take ginger about half an hour before traveling to prevent motion sickness. Duke recommends taking one 480-milligram standardized supplement twice a day, or 2 to 4 grams of dried ginger up to three times a day. To ease joint stiffness, you can soak a towel in ginger tea and apply it directly to your skin.</p><p>Those with gallbladder disease should avoid using ginger, and it also may interact with anticoagulant drugs. Pregnant women who wish to use it to prevent morning sickness should first check with their health care practitioner.</p><p></p><hr /><h5>Have you used ginger medicinally?
