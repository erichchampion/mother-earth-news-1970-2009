                    <h5 id="byline">by MARY GAYLE FURLOW    </h5>    <p>    <strong>â€¢ PHOTOS BY      BILL FURLOW</strong>    </p>    <p>      Home gardeners in the Rocky Mountains receive plenty of      encouragement to use chemicals. In one recent Denver-area      newspaper alone, I counted no less than <em>ten</em>      recommendations for insecticides, fungicides, pesticides      and sterilant sprays! In addition, the only suggestion our      local money-hungry nursery retailers would hand us when our      giant black walnut tree out front became infested with      aphids was, ". . . spray 'em!" Little wonder my husband and      I fell prey to the old "chemical spray is the only way"      cliche.    </p>    <p>      In desperation, since we didn't want to lose our valuable      nut tree, we finally called a chemical application company      and asked them to come and rescue the black walnut. Mere      toddlers in ecological thinking that we were at the time,      we requested that a "soft" insecticide be used.    </p>    <p>      The tree was sprayed with Malathion, which we were assured      was completely "safe" and would break down within 20 days.      I now realize the spray company probably meant that      Malathion was safe . . . <em>if you</em> and all your      animals wore gas masks. The day after the application my      cat was sick and I looked like a combination case of      measles and chicken pox. Both problems were immediately      diagnosed as allergic reactions to the insecticide.    </p>    <p>      Disgusted, we added the cost of a doctor and a veterinarian      to the $15.00 we had paid for the spraying (for a total      cost of $35.00) . . . and a week later, when a violent      rainstorm washed the Malathion off the tree, the aphids      were back.    </p>    <p>      Our black walnut really suffered that summer and so did we.      We felt sick every time we looked at the tree. Day by day      its branches became droopier and more bare as the ravenous      aphids sucked their way through its leaves. We didn't know      what to do . . . but we were sure we wouldn't spray again.    </p>    <p>      Just as we were about to admit defeat, we heard of a      live-ladybugs-by-mail business in California. Well, anyone      who ever watched insects as a child knows the ladybug is a      predator (aphids top their gourmet list) . . . and here was      a place where we could buy all we needed!    </p>    <p>      It didn't take an adding machine to help us compare costs,      either. The ritualistic application of insecticides totaled      a ridiculous minimum of <em>$15.00</em> <em>a month per      tree</em> (not counting any subsequent expense for doctors      and-maybe-funerals). A whole summer's worth of      friendly, living, <em>natural</em> bug munchers-on      the other hand-would set us back the fantastically      low amount of only $3.00. Like a flash, we sent off our      three bucks for a one-pint container of ladybugs. While      waiting for them to arrive, we learned some interesting      facts about natural-versus-chemical control of undesirable      insects.    </p>    <p>      Heavily quoted government studies have revealed that      contact poisons (such as DDT, Malathion or Parathion) are      100% effective insect controls. Unfortunately, the same      handy government report does not mention that the      much-glorified 100% includes (right along with the bad      bugs) all beneficial pollen-carrying and predatory insects      such as honey bees and ladybugs . . . the productive      bacteria in the soil . . . and, of course, earthworms.    </p>    <p>      A second (and noticeably less quoted) government study      states that natural predatory controls-such as      lovable little ladybugs-will be not less than 75%      effective . . . with none of the harmful side results so      evident after the application of contact poisons.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say; we were more than ready to accept the 75%      odds against our aphids.    </p>    <p>      The ladybugs, neatly contained in a small, sturdy box with      a wire-mesh front, arrived in less than two weeks. That      evening, we carefully released about half of them into the      branches of the walnut tree. The rest we stored in the      refrigerator where, according to instructions packed with      our order, the tiny spotted beetles would keep nearly      indefinitely.    </p>    <p>      The next morning we dashed out to see how our friendly      helpers were doing. A hungry ladybug, we had been told, can      eat 20 aphids a day . . . and ours were obviously hungry!      One or more of the beetles was busily crunching aphids on      every leaf we examined. With a magnifying glass, we could      clearly see the banquet in progress for nearly a week . . .      until the "bad guys" were gone and the tree damage had      stopped. Suddenly, we seldom saw a single aphid      where-just a few days before-the black walnut's      foliage had literally been crawling with them.<br />    </p>    <p>      The ladybugs stayed around that summer and cleaned up the      subsequently hatching aphids, fruitscales, leaf hoppers,      mites and grubs. Our garden and orchard had never been so      pest-free and-as an added bonus-the little      beetles weren't washed away by rainstorms.    </p>    <p>      Now we order ladybugs every year and, according to our      postman (who thinks it's highly amusing), we're no longer      alone. More and more folks in our area are buying the      predatory beetles too . . . which means fewer local      applications of poisonous sprays. There's even a      possibility that we'll be able to stop ordering the      ladybirds altogether in a couple of years since they seem      to be returning to our area each spring after their      winter's sleep.    </p>    <p>      Aphid epidemics are easy to recognize. The leaves of the      trees they infest begin to look transparent as the ground      underneath becomes sticky and shiny from the "honeydew"      which the pests exude. (Many people blame their trees when      they discover this residue on their cars . . . not      realizing that the trees are being attacked.)    </p>    <p>      Now that we know how to control aphids, we watch neighbors'      yards for signs of the insects' damage. As soon as we      discover the plant lice at work, we release (with      permission, of course) a few dozen of our refrigerated      ladybugs.    </p>    <p>      We refer to this as our "free home trial" and are always      amused to see skeptical expressions change to looks of      surprise as the aphid damage stops. At $3.00 for a year's      supply of friendly, good-natured, <em>natural</em> pest      control . .. we can afford to be generous!    </p>

The little nests had returned immediately after a rainstorm washed away the foul-smelling poison . . . so we TOP RIGHT: placed an order with a California company for a half-pint of live ladybugs. The sturdy, well-ventilated container of predator insects arrived via air mail within two weeks. I removed them from the mailbox and stored them in the refrigerator to keep the ladybugs calm until evening. LEFT ABOVE: Toward sundown, I opened the box and placed it in the crotch of the old walnut tree. As dusk fell, I sprinkled the container and surrounding area with water to encourage the ladybugs to crawl out. RIGHT ABOVE: Aroused by the smell of water, the hungry and thirsty ladybirds clambered from the container during the night and spread throughout the branches of the walnut tree.
