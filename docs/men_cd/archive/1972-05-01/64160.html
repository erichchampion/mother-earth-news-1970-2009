                    <h5 id="byline">by FRITZ and MEGHAN BERNARD</h5>    <p>      My wife, Meghan, and I have found that a comfortable house,      sturdy outhouse and woodshed can still be built for      practically nothing here in the continental United States      (as we'll soon relate) . . . but one thing definitely costs      money today and that one thing is land. So we worked two      years at jobs we didn't especially like-Meghan as a      school teacher and myself in construction and other odd      jobs-and bought our own little chunk of earth with      the money we earned. After that, the rest came easy.    </p>    <p>      We chose to settle in northwestern Montana for four      reasons: (1) to get away from hyperactive politics, (2) to      drink sparkling, clear water from a mountain stream, (3) to      breathe clean air and (4) to be part of the beautiful,      snowy, peaceful winters. True, snowmobiles have destroyed      some of that peacefulness . . . but the people who own such      machines must hold a 9-to-5 job to support them and,      therefore, can come up to the mountains on weekends only.      Our paradise is still quiet five days a week . . . and it's      here that we've built a two-room cabin, a woodshed and an      outhouse-all three-for under $215.00.    </p>    <p>      The cabin-except for log beams and log      foundation-is constructed entirely of cull 2 x 4's.      It seems that one of the many sawmills in our region cuts      only this one standard size of lumber and many of the      timbers produced by the still are short, split or have      minor flaws. The culls, which average about seven feet      long, are sold in large bundles for approximately 7      1/2 cents each. By laminating these "seconds", one on top      of another, we found we could build a solid wall four      inches thick that was not weakened by the imperfections in      the individual pieces of lumber.    </p>    <p>      We began our new home last summer by constructing a      foundation of fir log. We could have chosen spruce, balsam,      birch or tamarack just as easily but-of the      four-spruce and balsam rot rapidly once subjected to      dampness . . . and birch is just too beautiful to cut.      Tamarack and fir are both strong and long-lasting and we      picked the latter only because two large fir trees were      near our building site.    </p>    <p>      In addition to being tough and tenacious, fir-we soon      learned-is also extremely heavy. We felled the trees,      cut. them into 20-foot lengths, peeled them and let 'em dry      and lighten in the hot summer sun. Even after seasoning, it      was a threeman job to wrestle each log into place.    </p>    <p>      Foundations should be both level and square . . . no small      feat on our mountainous building site. We placed the      largest logs we had on the downhill side of the slope,      positioned the smaller ones uphill and filled in around      them all until we had the beams anchored firm and true.    </p>    <p>      The best way to level a foundation without expensive tools      is by picking up a new or used length of clear plas tic      hose long enough to react, diagon ally across the structure      you're building. Fill the hose with water and level from      point A (a reference point) to point B by holding one end      of the tubing up at A, allowing the hose to slump in the      middle and moving the B end of the tubing up and down until      the water's height at end A is on the reference mark. Check      and you'll find the water at B at the same level.    </p>    <p>      To square a foundation, measure it diagonally both ways.      When the diagonals are exactly the same length, you can be      sure the structure is absolutely square.    </p>    <p>      Once our 20-foot-long foundation logs were firmly bedded,      we placed 14-foot joists across them at right angles. We      then nailed a floor of 2' x 4's across the joists and      started stacking and nailing the cabin's walls, one on top      of another. It was amazing to see how fast those walls went      up.    </p>    <p>      We placed only one average-size window in the front and one      in each of the cabin's two sides . . . and we've found that      our lighting is inadequate. If we had it to do over, we'd      now figure at least one <em>large</em> window per wall.      Wood (and our house is nothing but) absorbs light and makes      the building much darker inside than one would think.    </p>    <p>      The lower a structure is, the easier it is to heat. We      therefore placed three equally spaced 14-foot log ceiling      beams only 6 1/2 feet off the floor. Again, to save heat,      the roof we built (of 2 x 4's) over laminated 2 x 4 rafters      is very low pitched. So low pitched that we worried the      typical worry that heavy snows might cave in the top of      lodge . . . until we found that excess snow is melted off      the building by escaping heat.    </p>    <p>      We installed durable asphalt roll roofing on our homemade      home, taking care-as a local professional had      instructed us led us-to put a double layer over      building's eaves (where ice may form and tear the covering)      and crown.    </p>    <p>      Our front door, made of 2 x 4 laminated vertically with a      birch limb a handle, is so heavy that we to swing it from      <em>four</em> 9-inch hinges. And folks be sure to move that      monstrous wood stove in <em>before</em> you hang the door .      . . we didn't, and we had to screw all those hinges on      twice.    </p>    <p>      The six by fourteen-foot across the front of our cabin was      built exactly like the cabin itself. We just extended the      building's roof to cover it. In the summer (we faced our      house south to take full advantage of the sun), that porch      becomes a wonderful place to spend the long evenings.      During <em>cold</em> weather, we stack wood on the porch      and our dog lives underneath in a snug home insulated with      straw.    </p>                  <p>      As soon as we had our house and porch up and roofed, we      caulked-or chinked-the walls of the main      structure. We chinked only on the inside (maybe we'll catch      the outside next year) and it took three to four      cases-we lost exact count-of caulking compound      to fill the cracks between the layers of lumber. With that      detail finished, we moved into our new home! It had taken      us 15 days-working from sunrise to sunset-to      build the 20' x 14' cabin and six-foot-wide porch,    </p>    <p>      The first time outside temperatures dipped to 30 below last      winter, we found the cold coming up through the floor of      our brand new house. Straw stuffed under the building and      snow banked completely around its foundation cured the      situation for the rest of the season although a double      floor with insulation between would certainly be a better      permanent solution.    </p>    <p>      While on the subject of frigid weather I should mention      that the lower the mercury dropped last winter, the more we      noticed the draft coming in around our windows. We had      gotten the windows free because they were slightly warped .      . . and I'm afraid we didn't custom-fit our casings to the      bowed sashes quite as tightly as we might have. I recommend      more care with such details.    </p>    <p>      We deviated from our laminated 2 x 4 construction technique      when we built the outbuildings on our homestead. In this      age of concrete floors and aluminum walls, you know, many      farmers are tearing down the old to make way for the new.      We found such a farmer who wanted a chicken barn removed      and we dismantled the structure for the lumber in it. The      jolt gave us enough material to build an outhouse, a      woodshed and the furniture and shelves in our cabin.    </p>    <p>      While putting in the outhouse we began to realize that      anyone digging a hole six feet deep and two-and-a-half feet      square through rock and gravel . . . only wants to do it      once. So we built a casing to fit that hole and prevent it      from collapsing.    </p>    <p>      Our approach to designing the actual privy may be a little      unorthodox . . . but what we did was we measured the toilet      seats and just kind of worked out from there. Backhouses      (being relatively small) don't need foundations in the      sense that larger buildings do . . . so we just built a 2 x      4 frame for ours and embellished the structure with a      generous porch across its front.    </p>    <p>      In addition to supplying us with siding, the barn we tore      down gifted our homestead with a couple of doors, hinges, a      milk can, chicken manure for the garden, two repairable      work harnesses and twelve log rafters. We decided to use a      few of those timbers to make a high peaked roof over our      privy and its porch.    </p>    <p>      With the high roof on the outhouse, we had room for a      ventilating window in front and another on the back of the      building (both are screened to prevent bugs from entering).      The privy door is the original front door from the chicken      barn. And yes, you're right . . . no matter how it's built,      an outhouse is cold in a Montana winter.    </p>    <p>      The third structure we erected on our land was the      woodshed. It was easy . . . no floor or foundation was      needed. We built the frame from the last of the 2 x 4's and      used recycled barn boards for the siding and the roof. The      former back door on the chicken became the door to the wood      and the few dollars we spent for the roll roofing with      which we topped the building was almost our entire expense      for the structure.    </p>    <p>      We designed the woodshed to six cords of firewood plus our      carpentry and gardening tools . . . and since found the      structure hand for drying weeds and flowers, hanging meat,      storing dry goods or whatever.    </p>    <p>      With three snug buildings erected on our land, we thought      our carpentry duties were completed . . . until we noticed      that we owned more possssions than we could fit into a 14'      x 20' cabin. So we made the house ten feet longer by adding      another room directly to the back of the original      structure.    </p>    <p>      The addition was easier said than done in some respects      because there was a slight rise behind the cabin and we had      agreed to build only with the contours of the land. So we      elevated the back room.    </p>    <p>      Once the addition was completed we connected it to the main      house by borrowing a chain saw and cutting a door-size hole      in the back wall of original cabin. The severed stud were      cased in with 2 x 4's (to make neat entry way) and two      steps up the new room were added to the passage.    </p>    <p>      And does our new "split level" work? Probably better than      you'd expect . . . because it contains the element of      separation that is often needed when two people live      together and alone for long, isolated periods.    </p>    <p>      We're kind of pleased with our outhouse and woodshed, too.      For $215 ... we think we've done all right.    </p>
