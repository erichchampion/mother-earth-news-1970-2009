                		<h5 id="byline">by KAE TIENSTRA</h5>         <p>      <em>It's 4</em> <em>A.M.</em> <em>in the deserted stable      area</em> of <em>a large thoroughbred race track. Except      for the monotonous drone of night insects and the      occasional trill of a waking bird, the area is silent.      Then, almost imperceptibly a slowly moving car and trailer      creep between the rows of horse stables. Shadowy figures      move from the trailer to the stables with full bags slung      otter their shoulders like summertime Santas.</em>    </p>    <p>      Despite the early hours, the men described above actually      have an interesting and satisfying "down home" business      going for them. They're delivering fresh-cut clover to the      owners of race horses . . . and a like operation can net      you $1,000-$3,000 for under 400 hours of summer work.    </p>    <p>      The "grass business"-as it was dubbed long agowas      created in 1926 by my father-in-law, John Tienstra. Alone      or in partnership with others, he ran such an operation      each summer until 1965 . . . and every medium to large race      track in the country can support at least one similar      enterprise today.    </p>    <p>      The grass business is not for everybody. It entails ungodly      hours, hard work, threats from bumblebees and lightning      bolts . . . and little glory. Then again, if you like the      idea of being your own boss while you work in rhythm with      Mother Earth, the establishment of your own clover runs      might be just what you're looking for. If there's a race      track within a 50-mile radius of your home or homestead,      you're sitting on a potential grass business . . . and that      potential is growing every year. At one time, prestige      racing (which means big money which means free-spending      owners) was mostly limited to thoroughbreds. Now that the      "big time" racing of standardbreds, Appaloosas, Arabians      and quarter horses is becoming more popular, however, the      demand for fresh-cut-and-delivered clover is showing a      corresponding increase.    </p>        <p>      The basic mechanics of the grass business are much like      those of a milk delivery route. Full bags of purple-topped      clover are dropped off at the stables each morning and      empty bags are picked up. Just as a good milkman makes his      rounds in the cool morning hours, so too does a good grass      man. Glover has a delicate nature and-once      cut-tends to wilt and sour in warm summer      temperatures.    </p>    <p>      Your first step in setting up a grass route is easy: go to      the main office of a race track or tracks, ask for a permit      to deliver fresh feed and explain that you'll be making      your rounds in the early morning. The track officials will      give you a pass and sticker for your vehicle. There may be      a slight charge for this permit but it'll be worth it , . ,      the documents will allow you to travel within the stable      area unhampered by security personnel.    </p>    <p>      Once you've secured access to the track you'll need a      source of fresh clover , . . and, since trainers and owners      are pretty particular about what they feed an expensive      horse, you'll want to be sure your greens are <em>at      least</em> 75% purple-topped clover. Of course the foliage      should be free of insecticides. If you lease a field from a      farmer, emphasize that you'll be selling the fresh feed to      horses and that you want absolutely no chemical fertilizers      or pesticides applied to the land.    </p>    <p>      Mr, Tienstra leased five acres of such clover near the      track he serviced. He only paid for what he actually      harvested and, depending on weather conditions, John      usually handled two cuttings of the fresh greens per acre      per season. His total expenditure was about $500 a year.    </p>    <p>      The equipment you'll need is pretty simple and      straightforward: (A) a car in running condition, (B) twenty      or thirty 100 lb.-size burlap or cotton sacks obtained at      the track, from a feed mill or farmer, (C) a "German"      scythe, preferably with an aluminum handle and a pounded      steel blade, (D) a handmade windrow attachment for the      scythe, (E.) a homemade sack rack which enables one man to      bag clover quickly and efficiently and (F) a route book for      keeping daily records. Once you're sure your new business      is going to pay off, you can invest in a flatbed trailer      and a trailer hitch for your car.    </p>        <p>      Familiarize yourself with the scythe before you make your      first grass run. It'll take a little practice but the tool      has several advantage is over other forms of cutting      clover. First, it's hand operated . . . eliminating even      the slightest possibility of noise or air pollution. By the      way, if you think that noise is a trivial concern, try      operating a Ford tractor and a cutting bar in an      otherwise-deserted clover field at four in the morning.      You'll be amazed at the number of irate law officers you'll      attract.    </p>    <p>      The second advantage a German scythe offers is its economy.      Most agricultural supply centers stock them for under $20.      Check the farm auctions in your area and you're likely to      find one offered for as little as a dollar.    </p>    <p>      And finally, because a scythe is small and compact, it'll      fit in the trunk of any car and is no problem to transport      or store.    </p>    <p>      John Tienstra preferred an aluminum handle-or      math-on his scythe. Such a lightweight snath is less      tiring to use . . , but aluminum scythe handles are      becoming increasingly hard to find and you may have to      settle for a wooden one.    </p>    <p>      The windrow attachment added to the scythe (see Diagrams 1      & 2) is a simple wire device designed to save a lot of      work. It "gathers" the cut greens as you make each swing      with the tool and "unloads" at the end of every swath as      you begin a backswing. In this way, the cut clover is      bunched into a windrow against uncut and still-standing      plants (see Fig. 1).    </p>    <p>      Each man works a scythe differently and there are few      "rules". It is important to keep both feet flat on the      ground, however, and "shuffle" rather than stride forward      as you cut. Also-to avoid stabbing the ground with      the point of the cutting edge-the heel of the blade      must be kept on the ground with the tip pointing slightly      upward. Give yourself a few hours to work with your scythe.      When you're skilled enough to cut a straight 20 foot swath      in foot-high grass, you're probably ready to make your      first grass run.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Tienstra swears that early morning is the only suitable      time to make a run. Aside from the fact-mentioned      earlier-that clover is highly perishable, it's only      before 5 A.M. that a race track's stable area is clear of      horses and people. Soon after five, trainers and owners      start scurrying back and forth and stable boys begin      bringing the horses out for exercise. Finely bred race      horses are a nervous lot and they don't take kindly to      strange cars and trailers creeping past their doors. It's      better to be in, out and gone before the animals start      moving around.    </p>    <p>      The ground rules for your first trip to the      track-made to woo perspective clients-are a      little different, however. Since those clients won't be up      and about before five, you'd better plan to reach each the      stables around 6 o'clock. Cut enough clover in advance to      titillate the horses and their owners (about 15 or 20      sacks) . . . then-preferably without car and      trailer-visit the horse barns with a bag of the dewy      fresh greenery slung nonchalantly over your shoulder.    </p>    <p>      It shouldn't take much talking to convince the man in      charge of each mount that his horse is apt to feel better      and run faster if the animal's diet is enhanced with a      portion of your fresh fodder, Then again, don't be      discouraged if some of the track folks are wary and      suspicious at first. Racing has spawned a complicated      sub-culture which is sometimes difficult for an outsider to      penetrate. Underneath that seemingly tough exterior,      however, most successful owners and trainers are good      businessmen . . . who respect a straight operation and a      good product. Assure them that your clover is cut fresh      each morning (neither owners nor horses have any use for      day-old "specials") and that you'll deliver-rain or      shine-every day of the growing season. Tell them the      hour you plan to be at the stable each morning and when you      expect to collect your earnings. If you then deliver your      bills personally at the end of the month you'll seldom have      problems collecting your fee.    </p>    <p>      Clover is a very rich food and should be administered to      horses sparingly, so your customers won't want to buy much      more than one sack per day for every three horses in their      stable. For years Mr. Tienstra charged $1.00 a bag . . .      but prices have risen. Determine a fair price and stick to      it. No "special deals" to anyone.    </p>    <p>      After an hour of selling, break for a cup of coffee at the      track's cafeteria. The brew may eat the enamel off your      teeth but you'll find much morning business being      transacted at the tables. Watch and listen and you'll      doubtlessly make the acquaintance of more owners and      trainers who'll be interested in doing business with you.    </p>    <p>      After coffee, amble back to your rig (which you should have      taken pains to park in a highly visible spot) and busy      yourself with some of your equipment. If the car or trailer      is laden with bags of clover your activity will attract      attention and-hopefully-more customers.    </p>    <p>      That first morning at the track should be the last real      selling job you have to do. After you've contracted several      stables your best advertisement will be the word-of-mouth      that satisfied customers pass through the race track      grapevine. If you consistently deliver fresh clover at a      reasonable price you'll likely have all the business you      want within a few weeks.    </p>    <p>      In the beginning you may well want to hold the operation      down to a one-man enterprise. As word of your service gets      around, though, you're likely to be tempted to expand the      business in order to fill the increasing demand, Such      expansion is certainly possible, My father-inlaw has made      his clover runs alone and with as many as three other men.      As long as everyone was working toward the same end, the      four-man operation was little more trouble to handle than      when John worked by himself. For sheer practicality,      however, a two-man partnership seems to be nearly ideal for      the grass business.    </p>    <p>      Two men can work harmoniously and effectively and balance      the work load (cutting the right amount of clover for the      number of bags needed at the track and getting the foliage      delivered to the correct stables) evenly.    </p>        <p>      In the field, one partner works as cutter and the other      bags the clover and stacks it in the car trunk or on the      trailer. As the cutter mows the first swath, the bagger      counts his sacks and lays them about six feet apart      alongside the windrowed clover. Then the second man walks      down the row, filling bags on the sack rack (Diagram 3) as      he goes. When the cutter has mowed enough of the foliage,      he may help finish filling and loading the clover.    </p>    <p>      At the track, one man drives the car and marks down      deliveries in a tally book as the other carries full bags      to the stalls and picks up the empties (Fig. 2). Either      partner or both can collect the monthly payments . . . and      that's about it.    </p>    <p>      If you give this business a try I recommend that you remain      as unobtrusive as possible when you make your deliveries.      Although the horses will be stabled when you're there,      they'll still be able to hear your vehicle. Service it      regularly and keep its muffler in good shape. Drive slowly      near the stables and limit your conversation to the inside      of the car. Fire is a constant threat to any barn and      smoking at the track is a bad idea. Bear them in mind that      the people you're doing business with have invested a lot      of time and money (some of which you're pocketing) in their      horses. Don't blow, it. You've got a good thing going.    </p>    <p>      Good in more than just money... . . for this little grass      business has another dimension that can't be measured in      dollars and  cents. The men I've referred to in this article      haven't delivered clover for over five years . . , but the      memory of their summer grass runs is still vivid to each of      them.    </p>        <p>      Perhaps it was the sleepy humor of those early trips to the      field (where a two-cell flashlight slipped under the      cutter's belt was all the light needed or wanted) . . . or      the easy runs in to the track . . . or the mutual effort      needed to accomplish a physically demanding job. Maybe it      was just the basic desire that urban men have to feel dirt      on their hands and sweat on their brows as they braved      lightning bolts and bumblebees to reap the bounties of the      good earth. Whatever . . . it made the grass business an      unforgettable way to earn money.    </p>
