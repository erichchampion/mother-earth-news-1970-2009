        <p>Knowing how to do simple home improvement projects can save a lot of money and leave you feeling quite satisfied. Have you ever lamented in a moment of fix-it frustration, “Oh, I wish I knew how to fix …” or never started a project because you weren’t sure about the steps? Well, there are a variety of useful, inspiring DIY books available from your local library or bookstore.</p><p>Two that stand out are Reader’s Digest’s <i>New Fix-it Yourself Manual</i>, and Julie Sussman and Stephanie Glakas-Tenet’s book <i>Dare to Repair: A Do-It-Herself Guide to Fixing (Almost) Anything in the Home</i>.</p><p>The Reader’s Digest book promises: “How to repair, clean and maintain anything and everything in and around your home.” And the book delivers through detailed illustrations of how to take apart and reglue a frame chair, repair a faucet, disassemble and clean a toaster, tune up a lawnmower engine, and dozens more simple and complex repair projects. The exploded views throughout the book let you “see” the inner workings of the tools and appliances you are repairing.</p><p><i>Dare to Repair</i> is the ultimate in a simple home maintenance reference. Not just a book for single women, the book tells you what tools you need and walks you through how to change a furnace filter, clean the refrigerator coils, choose a screwdriver and unclog drains - many of the common maintenance tasks we all face, whether we rent an apartment or own our home.</p><p>These two books barely scratch the surface of handy how-to/do-it-yourself books. The books mentioned below are full of high-quality color photos and step-by-step instructions to help you through DIY projects, whether you’re a beginner or professional.</p><p><a title="Creative Homeowner" href="http://www.creativehomeowner.com/" target="_blank">Creative Homeowner</a> offers books that will take you through the process of remodeling a kitchen, bathroom, garage or attic; rewiring a house or room; and creating cabinets and shelves.

Norm and his crew have assembled their home remodeling experiences into a number of great DIY books that will help you with home repair, as well as remodeling.</p><p>Two well-known DIY companies, <a title="Home Depot" href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank">Home Depot</a> and <a title="Black & Decker" href="http://www.blackanddeckerbooks.com/" target="_blank">Black & Decker</a>, have developed a series of books that can help anyone manage the maze of repairs and honey-do’s that are part and parcel of home ownership.</p><p>Every week, on the <a title="Do-It-Yourself" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Do-It-Yourself.aspx" target="_blank">Do-It-Yourself</a> page of our Web site, you can see new DIY projects and how-to information to inspire and instruct you.
