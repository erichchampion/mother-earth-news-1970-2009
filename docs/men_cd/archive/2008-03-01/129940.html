        <p>It's easy to get excited about solar and wind power. Choosing to produce your own electricity with <a title="rooftop solar panels" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Renewable-Energy/2006-10-01/Easy-Solar-Power.aspx" target="_blank">rooftop solar panels</a> or a <a title="backyard wind turbine" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Renewable-Energy/2007-06-01/Improved-Wind-Power.aspx" target="_blank">backyard wind turbine</a> is not only a great, sustainable option, but it can save you money, too.</p><p>That’s because tapping these renewable resources instead of fossil fuels reduces greenhouse gases, as well as mining wastes, and many other sources of air and water pollution. And renewable energy from the sun and wind is completely free. Once you purchase the initial system, you don’t have to spend money on the fuel to run it. Those savings add up quickly!</p><p><i>But how much solar and wind energy are available where you live?</i> The fact is that some locations are much sunnier or windier than others. Without a steady supply of either wind or sunshine, generating your own electricity at home may not be a practical option. So how do you find out whether a home solar- or wind-electric system will work for you?</p><h3>One Quick Estimate</h3><p>Fortunately, it's getting easier to learn about renewable energy thanks to handy online calculators and other resources.</p><p>A good place to start is the <a title="MyWatts Estimator" href="http://www.chooserenewables.com/estimator_start.php" target="_blank">MyWatts Estimator</a>. This is a free service provided by <a title="blocked::http://www.chooserenewables.com/" href="http://www.chooserenewables.com/" target="_blank">ChooseRenewables.com</a> (a company that provides the estimates free, but does sell related products and services.) Just type in your location, and you immediately get a map and short summary of the solar and wind resources in your area.</p><p>This is a rough estimate, but it's a good starting place. For example, you can quickly see that your wind power resource is “good,” while your solar power resource is merely “average,” or vice versa.</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>At this point, you might want to look at some of the resources specific to solar or wind. The sites below have much more background information about these options, and they also can help you locate renewable energy professionals in your area who can give you a better estimate of the costs specific to your situation.</p><p><b><i>More Solar Resources:</i></b><i> </i></p><ul><li><a title="blocked::http://findsolar.com/index.php" href="http://findsolar.com/index.php" target="_blank">FindSolar.com</a> is affiliated with the <a title="U.S. Department of Energy" href="http://www.doe.gov/index.htm" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Energy</a> (DOE, the <a title="American Solar Energy Society" href="http://www.ases.org/" target="_blank">American Solar Energy Society</a> and the <a title="Solar Electric Power Association" href="http://www.solarelectricpower.org/" target="_blank">Solar Electric Power Association</a>. It’s a terrific one-stop resource for anyone considering a solar-electric system. To get started, just plug your location and average utility bills into the <a title="Solar Estimator" href="http://findsolar.com/index.php?page=rightforme" target="_blank">Solar Estimator</a>, and it calculates the average cost of a solar-electric system based on the average solar resources in your area, your electricity usage, and any state and local rebates you may qualify for. If you like what you see, you can contact solar installers and distributors in the site’s <a title="blocked::http://findsolar.com/index.php?page=findacontractor" href="http://findsolar.com/index.php?page=findacontractor" target="_blank">directory</a> for more information.

(For example, can your roof support photovoltaic panels? Does your state offer net metering?)<br /></li><li>If you’d like to learn more about the factors that can affect your home’s solar access, you can find much more information on evaluating your solar resources at <a title="blocked::http://www.builditsolar.com/index.htm" href="http://www.builditsolar.com/index.htm" target="_blank">BuilditSolar.com,</a> which has an excellent page of <a title="blocked::http://www.builditsolar.com/SiteSurvey/site_survey.htm" href="http://www.builditsolar.com/SiteSurvey/site_survey.htm" target="_blank">DIY resources.</a></li></ul><p><b><i>More Wind Resources:</i></b><i> </i></p><ul><li>The DOE’s <a title="blocked::http://www.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/windpoweringamerica/state_activities.asp" href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/windpoweringamerica/state_activities.asp" target="_blank">Wind Powering America</a> site can point you to available state and local resources.

But what if you don't? Or what if you decide that a solar or wind system doesn't make sense for you right now?</p><p>You don't have to give up on getting your electricity from renewable sources. Instead, consider buying green power from your utility. More and more utilities are offering consumers the option to buy their electricity from renewable sources, such as large wind farms and hydroelectric projects. You can learn more about green power <a title="here" href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/buying/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Also, there are many other ways to tap renewable energy, other than for electricity - for example for space and water heating. You can check out the dozens of articles on these topics at <a title="www.MotherEarthNews.com" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/" target="_blank">www.MotherEarthNews.com</a> to learn more about solar hot water, passive solar design, and wood and geothermal heat. Enjoy exploring your options!</p>
