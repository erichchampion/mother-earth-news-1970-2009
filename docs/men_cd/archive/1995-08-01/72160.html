                <p>      <strong>GARDEN AND YARD</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Jim Hildreth    </h5>    <p>      The gardening notebook's service as a growing tool ranks      right up there with the spade and trowel. A single sheet of      paper is all that many gardeners need to record the      valuable information of an entire growing season. Was it      the Black Seeded Simpson or Grand Rapids lettuce that      germinated poorly last year? The tomatoes were transplanted      too early and were damaged by cold, but were they set out      the second week of April or the third week? The answer to      those questions and many others are only a glance away when      you use an organized gardening notebook as a tool.    </p>    <p>      I designed my first gardening notebook nearly 15 years ago,      and though the categories of information have changed      through the years, it's always been kept as a single page,      easily read chart. On occasion I've been tempted to make it      more complicated, but found that keeping up with pages of      entries made the whole process a chore. Entering      information must be easy and retrieval even easier.    </p>    <p>      I reserve the top of each chart for information of a      seasonal nature. The year appears large and bold so the eye      keys to it immediately. I also include the dates of the      last and first killing frosts in my garden. Those dates      prove particularly important to people who garden in cooler      valleys, warmer slopes, and other areas where frost dates      veer from the norm of surrounding areas. For example, in an      area where the USDA has determined the first frost date as      September 28th, people gardening on south-facing slopes may      find the frost occurs consistently as early as September      19th. Therefore, recording the last frost and first frost      dates at your location significantly increases the chances      of gardening success.    </p>    <p>      The gardening notebook chart begins with the left-hand      column, "Vegetables." In this column I list the plants that      went into the garden that year including vegetables, herbs,      and ornamentals. To find how long ago a perennial herb such      as oregano was planted I simply scan this column on the      charts from previous years.    </p>    <p>      The "Variety" column names the variety of each plant      listed. This column is a must have when you grow more than      one variety, of a plant. For instance, plants such as COI      -11 and marigolds contain far too many cultivars to      remember which one was planted with great success six or      eight years ago.    </p>    <p>      Another bit of information that may he included in the      variety listing is the company from where the seeds, corms,      tubers, or plants were purchased. That would eliminate all      guesswork when trying to remember the source of a      particular seed or plant variety purchased years ago.    </p>    <p>      The "Seed Age" listing uses little space but provides      plenty of insight into the vitality of the seeds planted.      On the one hand, if t germination is poor the gardener      looks at the chart and easily determines if the seed, are      too old to sprout. On the other hand, the gardener may      quickly decide that age is not a consideration if the seeds      are relatively new. You can then contemplate other factors      such as improper storage overwatering to explain poor      germination.    </p>    <p>      Knowing how many plants of a particular crop were grown      during previous years often proves quite valuable,      especially for the home gardener with limited growing area.      We grew too many spinach plants last year, but how many      were there?    </p>    <p>      Likewise, maybe there was enough room for a few more      broccoli plants but it's difficult to remember if we grew      10 or 12 plants. The "# Planted" column eliminates this      guesswork.    </p>    <p>      The number of days to maturity and days to germination      usually appear on seed packets, and you can use that useful      information on the gardening notebook chart under the      heading "Maturity/ Germination." Knowing the number of days      to maturity for each vegetable is vital to successful      garden planning. A Northern gardener, for example, knows      not to purchase seeds of a melon variety that matures in      120 days because the Northern growing season will end      before the melons ripen. Also, if a grower knows that a      spinach variety matures in 42 days, he or she has a pretty      good idea when the spinach will be harvested and when that      plot will become available for planting a second crop.    </p>    <p>      The days to germination entered on the chart often puts my      mind to rest when dealing with difficult-to-germinate      seeds. If I plant parsley seeds and two weeks later they      haven't sprouted, I don't panic. I look in my gardening      notebook and see they need 18-24 days to germinate. On the      other side, let's say I planted lettuce seeds a week ago      and they haven't sprouted. The info in my gardening      notebook indicates they should have germinated four days      ago. Obviously, there's a problem and I replant that      variety.    </p>    <p>      The "Date Planted" column is for recording the date that      seeds of each plant variety are sown, whether indoors or      outdoors. These dates aid in garden planning by providing      an exact point in time that can later be referenced and      future planting dates tailored to. An obvious application      to such a reference concerns growing tomatoes. Most      gardeners want ripe tomatoes as early as possible, earlier      than the year before. Want to plant tomato seeds a week      earlier than last year? Simply check your gardening      notebook for the exact planting date last year and plant      accordingly.    </p>    <p>      I like to chart when a seed sprouts because knowing that      date generally sets the date for transplanting the seedling      outdoors. Then I can make plans to set the seedlings out at      the best time to avoid the initial, most damaging wave of a      specific insect pest.    </p>    <p>      If the initial emergence of leafminers in my area is May      10th, I try to transplant spinach seedlings as early as      possible in April. That gives them time to establish      themselves well enough to sustain leafminer damage from the      first hatching.    </p>    <p>      The "Date Sprouted" information also serves as a      cross-check when seed viability is in question. New lettuce      seeds that sprouted in three days last year should      germinate in three or four days this year, too. The warning      flag goes up if those seeds show no sign of life after five      days, especially if the date in "Date Sprouted" indicates      trouble.    </p>    <p>      The "Trans." or transplanted column ties in nicely with      info from several of the other headings. Entering      transplanting dates gives a reference point for getting      those tomatoes into the ground two weeks sooner than last      year. If the cold gets them, maybe they'll be transplanted      only a week earlier the following year.    </p>    <p>      The transplanting dates also relate to the sprouting dates.      Did transplanting those spinach seedlings early to miss the      leafminer emergence work? The transplanting date can be      adjusted to better address the pest problem or left alone      if all went smoothly. Either way, results-oriented planning      becomes possible when a gardening notebook is kept.    </p>    <p>      I always receive a feeling of satisfaction when entering a      date in the harvest column. That final entry completes an      informative profile of each plant variety I grew that year.      The profile becomes a gardening archive that can be      referred to during the next few years or decades from now.      It shows how near to or far from the stated maturity date      the actual harvest was gathered. Add the "days to maturity"      printed on the seed packet to the date a variety was      transplanted and compare this projected date to the actual      date the plants were harvested. Sometimes the two dates      jibe nicely. When they don't, we have all winter to figure      out what delayed the harvest.    </p>    <p>      The remainder of the chart is dedicated to "Notes." All      types of pertinent information should be entered here,      limited only by the amount of space given. Damage from      insects, control measures taken, harvest weights, early      flowering, watering schedules, and comments on flavor are      just a sampling of the types of information that may be      entered in the notes section.    </p>		       <p>      CHART DESIGN JAMIE LEO    </p>
