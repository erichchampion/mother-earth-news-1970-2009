                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY VET</strong>    </p>            <p>      <strong>Andrea Looney, DVM, explains how to roost fowl      pests out of the henhouse and off the hens.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Photos By Jon Reis/Photo Link    </p>    <p>      Dear Andrea:    </p>    <p>      I have 45 chickens ranging in age from 10 months to two      years. Last year I sprayed the henhouse once a month with      malathion to keep away lice and mites brought in by      visiting wild birds. I'm not keen on using the malathion.      What are your suggestions?    </p>    <p>      <em><em>-Molly Stanley</em> <em>Address withheld by      request</em></em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Molly:    </p>    <p>      The most common species of mites which infect chickens are      the chicken mite, the northern fowl mite, and the tropical      fowl mite. There are over 40 species of lice that can be      found on poultry. Mites are smaller than lice and while      mites feed on blood alone, most lice can feed on bits of      feather, skin, and blood. Both can cause anemia,      unthriftiness, and even death, especially in young birds.      The chicken mite is particularly serious in warmer parts of      the States. Adult female mites lay eggs within 12-24 hours      of attachment. Some females are so hardy that they can      survive up to 30 weeks or more without food. These mites      can affect turkeys, pigeons, canaries, and several species      of wild birds. Sparrows are thought to transmit the mite.    </p>    <p>      Malathion is an organophosphate, which are among the most      effective pesticides when used correctly. However, chickens      overdosed with malathion may experience muscle tremors and      even seizures, and it goes without saying that people have      become more concerned about the potentially hazardous      effects of pesticides on the food chain.    </p>    <p>      Pyrethrins are also effective pesticides and are considered      a more organic form of miticide since they are derivatives      of the chrysanthemum. Permethrin, a pyrethrin derivative,      can be used to treat both the birds and the house at      concentrations of 0.05 percent. This will prevent mite      infestation for up to eight weeks. The most effective      treatment, however, is routine cleaning and monitoring of      both all incoming birds and the facility itself.    </p>    <p>      First, the litter should be changed on a regular, frequent      schedule. The nest boxes should be sealed yearly with      varnish or paint. Roosts should be treated with      preservative two or three times per year. The house should      be cleaned out and all cracks and crevices steam-cleaned      and treated with a pesticide once the birds are removed.      The building should be closed up tight for an hour or two      following fumigation and then adequately ventilated for an      additional hour before returning the birds. Regular yard or      pasture rotation is essential to the health of any      livestock or poultry.    </p>    <p>      Pesticide treatment of the birds themselves is essential,      especially to the point that the skin is wet. Yet if the      housing is neglected, treatment won't be complete. Checking      and treating the house, feed and egg crates, cases, and      flats along with all your chicken-house clothing and boots      is of great importance. If one area is neglected, it is of      no use to treat the rest. Houses are the most affected, yet      least aggressively treated, areas.    </p>    <p>      Dear Andrea:    </p>    <p>      We own a few Hampshire feeder pigs who have had distorted      snouts since birth. What's the cause of this?    </p>    <p>      <em><em>-Jake McColly Joliet, IL</em></em>    </p><p>Dear Jake:</p>    <p>      Several bacteria are commonly found in the upper air      passages of pigs. These bacteria have special    </p>        <p>      appendages that allow them to firmly attach to cells inside      the nasal cavity. Some bacteria and the toxins that they      produce irritate the nasal cells so much that the nose      tissue is severely damaged. This produces the      mild-to-severe coughing, sneezing, nose rubbing, and      obvious snout distortion for which the disease is known. At      times, black tear streaks can be seen running from the      eyes. In severe cases, the rhinitis, or nasal inflammation,      can result in pneumonia as well.    </p>    <p>      Mild occurrences of this disease-known as atrophic      rhinitis-pose minimal economic consequences to pork      producers, and often do not warrant the expense of      treatment. Severe outbreaks or recurrence of signs however,      require urgent action. To treat this disease requires      strategy. Since the disease is extremely contagious, don't      introduce any new pigs to your herd if you can help it. In      fact, when purchasing, try to buy those pigs vaccinated      against the disease or less severely affected. Injectable      and oral antibiotics in feed and water may help halt      disease progression. One of the most appropriate ways to      treat the disease, however, is to prevent it via reduced      stress. For pigs, this means in particular improved      ventilation, decreased dust, and increased hygiene via more      efficient manure removal.    </p>    <p>      Dear Andrea:    </p>    <p>      I'm a first-year vet student, specializing in large      animals, at University of California. I'm finding that      there are hundreds of causes of lameness in horses. In      fact, there have been books written in volumes on this      subject alone. One day I hope to be an expert, but, until      then, what basic things can I do to prevent and treat      lameness in my horses?    </p>    <p>      <em><em>Jennifer Stuart Davis, CA</em></em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Jennifer:    </p>    <p>      Living arrangements have much to do with injury. Late      summer pastures, once plush, are now filled with flies and      dried mud, cracked and hardened from the sun. Animals      turned out daily are usually not shod, and they may stomp      at flies and run awkwardly on the uneven ground, increasing      the likelihood of hoof bruises and cracks, both of which      invite bacterial infection. Uneven terrain may also bruise      soles and increase the risk of sprain, strain, and      tendinitis.    </p>    <p>      Pay close attention to horses turned out to pasture and      consider having front feet shod during fly season and in      dry weather. Likewise, damp or wet footing found in areas      of flood, swamp, or high humidity can cause a horse's foot      to expand, creating gaps at the white line (junction of      sole and hoof wall). Small pastures with many horses are      usually knee deep in manure at certain points, and bacteria      or parasites thrive here simply waiting for a chance to      invade a damp and injured hoof.    </p>    <p>      Use a hoof pick to clean manure and dirt from the hoof on a      regular basis. Carefully examine the hoof wall and      frog/sole to check for stones or plant matter. Puncture      wounds often appear as black spots which are extremely      sensitive to pressure. To locate an abscess, the      veterinarian will probe the hoof, sole, frog, and heel with      fingers and a hoof tester to find the precise spot of entry      of a penetrating object. The horse will commonly flinch      when it is pressed. Using a sharp hoof knife, a window is      created (usually less than half an inch in diameter) around      the wound or suspect area to allow infection to escape.      This is called "paring out" the wound. Soaking the foot in      warm Epsom salt baths and cleaning with hydro gen peroxide      helps keep this window open from drainage, and kills      bacteria. I am in favor of keeping small wounds un covered,      as ban daging often promotes wicking of material into the      wound and may also prevent proper drainage.    </p>    <p>      Conformation plays an incredibly large part in lameness.      Some horses with flat or thin soles, worn heels, or thin,      weak walls are susceptible to hoof injury. Horses with      upright pasterns-i.e.: not enough angle from heel to hoof,      contracted tendons, or knee deformities-are also      particularly prone to further damage to foot and hoof.      Regular visits from the farrier are important, especially      in horses with conformational faults, as corrective shoeing      is not only protective to the hoof, but can guard against      stress and pain in the rest of the leg and body during      exercise. Check the shoes frequently to see if they are      loose or in need of resetting, which should be done every      812 weeks. If the hoof grows quickly, the shoes can      actually cause harm by forcing an unnatural angle to the      pastern. Lameness so caused is usually temporary and      resolves with new shoes, but can become permanent if left      unattended due to abnormal stresses placed on the rest of      the leg.    </p>    <p>      Proper nutrition plays a great part in prevention of hoof      injuries and lameness. Whether the animal is an elite      athlete or a backyard companion, the types and amounts of      roughage, grains, and vitamins/minerals should be tailored      to exercise/stress needs in order to avoid problems with      either obesity or poor body condition.    </p>    <p>      Especially important in avoiding lameness problems is      assuring adequate levels of electrolytes (sodium, chloride,      potassium, magnesium) thiamine, biotin, selenium, and      vitamins C and E in a horse's diet. Constantly available      fresh water, especially at this time of year, is a must.      Horses fresh from exercise should not be allowed to drink      until adequately cooled down to avoid lameness or muscular,      cardiovascular, and colic (gastrointestinal) problems.    </p>    <p>      Proper exercise is essential. Temperatures in late summer      near 100 degrees or combined with high humidity (greater      than 50 percent) can cause a horse to sweat excessively,      increasing chances of muscle strain, sprain, tying up, heat      prostration, and simple exhaustion. Whatever the exercise,      try to preserve mental and physical condition, offering a      variety of workouts while minimizing the amount of stress      the animal feels. Help cope with seasonal weather extremes      by scheduling heavy workouts early in the day, before the      sun, temperature, humidity, and insect population are at      peak. Check equipment to be sure it fits well and there is      no wear or grime at key contact points. You'd never believe      how much lameness occurs because of faulty harnesses,      saddles, bridles, and other tack. Avoid particularly      difficult maneuvers on uneven ground and allow adequate      warm up before and cooling out after work.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, lameness is likely to crop up again later      in life in any horse with a history of lameness ,      especially if the owner doesn't pay attention to some of      the keys outlined above. Ninety percent of lameness occurs      in the foot and hoof, and a majority of these are found in      the horse's front legs. There's a great deal of truth in      the old statement, "No foot, no horse." Prevention and      sound management on the farm are the key to avoiding      lameness and saving your horse (and you!) from days of      pain, stress, and soreness.    </p>    <p>      Dear Andrea:    </p>    <p>      Our horse has terrible sores over his withers. We use a      saddle pad when exercising him.    </p>    <p>      What else can we do?    </p>    <p>      <em><em>-Paul Tucker Davenport, IA</em></em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Paul:    </p>    <p>      Several factors help create saddle sores, those crusting      blisters located behind the animal's shoulders, on the      withers (between the shoulder blades), and on sides of the      chest. Foremost of the causes of saddle sores is improper      saddling. Some saddles are made to fit only a sawhorse,      never an animal. An ill-fitting saddle, pad, or girth,      coupled with a heavy or awkward rider, and some dirty tack,      can turn the nicest horse into a painful, uncooperative      snide. Saddles are often sold by dealers who do not      understand <em>your</em> horse's anatomy in    </p>        <p>      particular and are anxious to sell the tack, not fit the      animal. Check your saddle carefully to be sure that it's      centered on the withers. Pressure sores over or behind the      withers are often caused by a saddle that is too low on the      back. Sores along the spine itself are often caused by      cheaply made saddles that are nailed together underneath      (with nails still evident) or by saddles with a high arch      that bounce on the spine during exercise.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to brush the back of the animal-even if there      is no time to brush the rest of the horse-prior to saddling      or applying any type of equipment. Likewise after exercise,      it helps immensely to wash the area under and around the      saddle, massaging areas of high contact. The saddle should      be cleaned with soft detergent (Murphy's oil soap) and      leather conditioner on a regular basis. Saddle pads quickly      absorb sweat and debris, and also need to be changed if not      washed frequently.    </p>    <p>      When actually saddling the horse, place the saddle a bit      forward on the withers and slide it back, snugging it into      place with the girth. This will eliminate hair bunching      inappropriately and causing sores. After the girth is      cinched, be sure that there is no fold of skin trapped      underneath it. If necessary, stretch the front legs out one      at a time, as if shaking hands with the animal to pull the      folds smooth.    </p>    <p>      Once a sore has developed, the quickest cure is to give the      horse's back a rest. In fact, if the horse needs to be      ridden, bareback is best. Otherwise, use different forms of      exercise and equipment which will not come near the injured      area. Experimenting with different saddles may help down      the line. But with an open sore, new tack may exacerbate      other painful areas, as the horse has learned to compensate      and shift weight appropriately to move under the painful      tack already. Rest is essential, as is cleanliness. Hot      packing and carefully drying, as well as preventing fly      contamination, will help. Most dressings occlude air which      is conducive to healing the broken skin. You can use a      horse with a saddle sore if you cut a pad so that no part      touches the sore, and place another pad over this one.      However, beware, as this pad arrangement slips easily and      usually causes old sores to worsen and new ones to appear.    </p>    <p>      Dear Andrea:    </p>    <p>      I have a five-year-old mixed terrier/shepherd who limps      very badly and has trouble getting up and standing any      length of time. She can no longer jump on the bed or couch.      What can I do?    </p>    <p>      <em>-Rose M. Jolly Kendall Park, NJ</em>    </p><p>Dear Rose:</p>    <p>      There are a number of problems which affect the back and      hind limbs of dogs, causing them a great deal of pain or      inability to exercise. The first step in diagnosing them      would be through manipulations performed by your      veterinarian. Once you know where the problem      originates-muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments,      nerves-X-rays are probably in order. Your veterinarian may      want to perform more specialized studies such as scans, dye      studies, or muscle activity measurements, to identify the      severity of the problems.    </p>    <h3>      SPLURGE ON A CUSTOM-MADE SADDLE: Too often, saddles are      sold by dealers anxious to just sell the tack, not fit your      horse's anatomy.    </h3>    <p>      In general, many shepherd and shepherd-mix dogs suffer from      a variety of spine, hip, and knee problems. The array of      conditions is so vast that it's difficult to pinpoint a      treatment to fit all. Weight reduction through an      appropriate diet-not simply decreasing the amount of      food-is important in treating most orthopedic problems. The      more weight, the more difficult it is for the animal to      heal appropriately.    </p>    <p>      In addition, pain relievers are often necessary. You can      use aspirin if your dog has had no bleeding and      gastrointestinal problems; dosages vary per specific animal      metabolism and weight. There are many veterinarians who      recommend essential fatty acids for arthritic problems.      These come in many formulations and are extremely      beneficial for dogs with skin, coat, and arthritis      problems. I happen to believe that many of these animals,      regardless of specific arthritic problem, would benefit      from certain joint fluid precursors, or cartilage extracts,      called polysulfated glycosaminoglycans, which can be given      in oral or injectable forms.    </p>    <p>      Exercise should be restricted to short, frequent walks      while repair of injured tissue takes place. Rest is      essential; physical therapy can be performed at home, and      if done correctly, helps the animal "warm up" for limited      exercise or "cool down" appropriately. Several surgical      options have become available, although your vet is best      able to make decisions on whether this is appropriate      treatment.    </p>
