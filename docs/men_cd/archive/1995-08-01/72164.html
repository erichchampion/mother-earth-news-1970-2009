                <p>      <strong>BACK COUNTRY SKILLS</strong>    </p>       <p>      Have you checked prices at the fish market lately?      Fresh-caught swordfish, halibut, salmon, and shrimp of      significant size cost the better part of 10 bucks a pound.      Even once-dirt-cheap ocean whitefish such as fillets of cod      or haddock go for double the price of red meat, and several      times the cost of poultry. And by all reports, prices will      continue to rise. Deep-sea fish stocks around the world      have been decimated by over-harvest, weather changes, and      pollution. And, belatedly-but better late than      never-the U.S. and Canadian government regulators are      reducing the catch further by closing major fishSing      grounds so the huge factory ships with their otter trawls,      drift nets, electronic fish locators, and on-board      flash-freezers don't gobble up the last of the breeding      stocks and make Atlantic cod and Pacific salmon truly      endangered species.    </p>    <p>      However, there is a wild fish resource that's both      self-renewing and so abundant that the lack of exploitation      can be a problem. It is also free for the taking and easy      for anyone to catch.    </p>    <p>      I don't mean "Government Fish": hatchery-raised rainbows,      togue, or lake trout, nor do I mean lunker black bass,      landlocked salmon, or walleyes, tacklebustin' Northern      pike, or muskies. These are all properly deemed      gamefish-a public natural resource that, like ducks,      deer, and other wildlife-is husbanded by sportsmen's groups      such as Ducks Unlimited and B.A.S.S., and managed by      relatively beneficent government agencies for the benefit      of recreational sportsmen ...who willingly underwrite their      friendly Fish & Game wardens, hatcheries, and stocking      programs through license fees, stamps, and taxes on bait      and tackle.    </p>    <p>      I refer to the abundant, easy to catch panfish that are      seldom sought for sport, but are left to kids with cane      poles and bent pins ...if they're fished for at all. An      intermediate link in the freshwater food chain, these      mostly foot-long-or-under species feed on bugs and minnows      and in turn are eaten by bigger game fish, raccoons, fish      eagles ...and by you and me. Indeed, they got the name      "panfish" because they fit so well into a hot frying pan.    </p>    <p>      First come the bottom-dwelling catfish that can be caught      in any water: both the big blue channel cat (that prefer      faster moving rivers and clear lakes and can grow to almost      four feet and 60 pounds in big water) and ordinary mudcats      found in more sluggish waterways, and often called      bullhead, madtom, horned pout, yellerbelly, of whiskers,      and other regional names of gustatory affection. They all      shuck out of their skins into succulent fish sticks that      demand to be blackened with Cajun spices, or pan fried and      served up with hush puppies and Cole slaw Tom Sawyer-style.      Then there are the free-swimming schools of white and      yellow bass and crappie that are best caught in open water      from boats.    </p>           <p>      For shore fishing, the continent hosts more than 30 species      of brightly colored, slab-sided sunfish variously called      rock bass, cracker, pun'kinseed, bluegill, sunny, red-ear,      or green-ear. All of 'em are called bream (pronounced      <em>brem)</em> in the South. One or another can be found in      preternatural abundance along rocky shores, under docks,      overhanging trees, and undercut sod banks. . . and lurking      at the edges of shallow weed beds, under snags, and along      drop-offs in practically every lake, pond, deep puddle,      river, stream, creek, bayou, branch, ditch, slough, swamp,      marsh, bog, and backwater of the land.    </p>    <p>      And then there's the best-eating of all: the      buttery-flavored yellow perch, a midsized member of a      family of long-bodied fish that includes walleyes and the      infamous snail darter. Remember that three-inch-long stream      minnow that became a hero of early environmentalism? Always      thinly distributed, it was problematically branded an      endangered species, and fostered a lawsuit that caught      public attention and halted construction of a TVA dam back      in '77. Subsequent research found that creeks in valleys      all around teemed with snail darters, and they weren't      endangered at all-but by then the media had lost      interest and Congress had quietly exempted that particular      chunk of pork barrel spending from the Endangered Species      Act.    </p>    <h3>      Preliminaries    </h3>    <p>      On the inland waters of every state and province, any      angler over age 16 or so must carry a fishing license ...or      be liable to a fine and confiscation of catch and tackle by      a game warden or local constable. Resident licenses don't      cost much, so take your driver's license or other proof of      residence to the courthouse or a tackle shop and get a      license.    </p>    <p>      Some jurisdictions require you to display the license      conspicuously while fishing so 01' Smokey doesn't have to      get off his/her duff to check licenses. Wearing the license      as a kind of grown-up Boy Scout badge, many hunters and      fishermen get a day-glo orange plastic carrier and display      it on the back of their hats all season long.    </p>    <p>      Kids don't need licenses, and you can save the fee by      taking along a batch of youngsters on every trip. Tell the      Smokey Bears that you're just there to bait hooks and lug      the huge stringer of fish. lust be sure there's only one      fishing pole per kid and no extras.    </p>    <p>      With the license, you should get a brochure of fishing      regulations. Read and follow them. Get a fish-identifying      manual too if you can't tell a coho salmon from a horsehead      sucker. Panfish are so hardy and prolific that there are no      longer any seasonal size or catch limits in most places.      But, if you load up the stringer with eight-inch hatchery      trout when the limit is 12 inches and two per day, your      claim that you thought they were yellow perch won't wash      with Fish & Game.    </p>    <p>      If you are unfamiliar with local waters, get a fishing map      too. Every tackle or bait store and many service stations      and hardware stores carry them. A map will identify      restricted areas so you won't get caught fishing with worms      in a dry-fly-only, catch & release trout stream. On the      positive side, it will locate all the legally fishable      streams, ponds, and impoundments, and indicate whether they      are cold-water bodies containing a relatively few trout or      warm-water that hosts the abundant bass/bluegill/catfish      populations you are after.    </p>    <h3>      Release The Big Ones    </h3>    <p>      Releasing all large-but-not-trophy-sized game fish is      becoming a ritual among knowledgeable anglers. It makes for      better sport in the long run, as fish are too dumb to      remember being caught; and if released unharmed but for a      hook prick in their bony jaw, they can thrill several      sportsmen a season for many years. The big fish are the      better spawners too ...though, any fish that swallows a      hook or otherwise appears to be injured should be kept if      it is legal. (You can't be penalized for catching      out-of-season or too-small fish just for keeping them.)      However, keeping every panfish you catch no matter when      caught or how small is actually recommended by many      authorities. The more small fry removed from a water body,      the more space is available to let the survivors grow      larger. (In other words, runty fish are more often the      result of too many fish in the pond due to too few      predators and too little fishing, rather than overfishing.)      The rule-of-possession for any fisherman is to keep no more      than you plan to eat. But, as we'll see below, with a      production-line cleaning operation and modern flashfreezing      techniques, you can put by as many panfish as you can      harvest.    </p>    <h3>      Equipment    </h3>    <p>      You can spend a small fortune on fishing gear, and many      high-end recreational anglers do. What with a $2,500      split-bamboo flyrod, a wallet of hand-tied flies, licenses,      and stream-fees and a wardrobe of L.L. Bean duds, an      eastern brook trout can cost more per pound than a Ferrari.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the objective of sport fishing is not food. When      it is, your gear requirements are minimal.    </p>    <h3>      Poles    </h3>    <p>      There is much to be said for the traditional "barefoot boy      with cheek..."style cane pole. Every spring you see sheaves      of them-some 12 to 16 feet long poking out of a trash bin      at the back of hardware stores and (for double the price)      at bait shops in fishing country. A long cane pole can      reach well into a pond and most of the way across many a      fiat land river. One problem is hauling those 16foot poles      in today's 12-foot vehicles. For this use, they make cane      poles that break into sections that attach with      ferrules-brass plug-and-sleeve joints. A jointed genuine      bamboo pole, complete with a hank of line, a bobber, and      hook, costs less than $6.    </p>    <p>      It takes no skill and little effort to drown worms with a      cane pole. It is passive fishing, and a good excuse to      escape whatever you need to get away from on a hot summer      afternoon when the fish aren't biting anyway. There are      more reasons than sport or supper to go fishing.    </p>    <p>      If you are experienced with casting reels, fiyrods, or      bail-equipped spinning rigs, use them. But for kids and      novices, the "spincasting" rig is best. Like a spinning      reel, the line is wound around a fixed spindle by a      revolving bail and when cast out, the line just loops off      with little resistance. The whole thing is enclosed, so      snags are harder to get. To cast with a spinning rod you      must hold and release the line with your forefinger. This      takes practice. So does a bait-caster that has a revolving      reel that can over-spin the line being cast out, producing      the famous backlash. In fly fishing you use a weighted line      to cast a tiny fly for great distances-also      snag-prone in any nearby brush, and requiring years of      experience.</p>    <p>Bait shops are fun, but you'll save a good half by    shopping in the fishing department of any mall discounter. A    lightweight, good-quality spin-casting rig-rod, reel and    line-can be had for about $25. I use a lightweight    telescoping rod with an underslung lever-acting spin-casting    reel that cost less than $30 and that works marvelously. Even    the littlest kid will need his/her own rig, and surprisingly    well-made spin-casting rigs sell for about $10. Some Japanese    spinning reels come with a lot of bells and whistles and cost    plenty. For my money, the best spinning reel made is the    original French designed Mitchell at under $35, and to this    day, I can't tell a discount store's carbon fiber rod from a    sporting goods store's best at 10 times the price.</p>    <p>      The one improvement over the low-priced package rod/reel      combos that I recommend is line. They come standard with      six-pound-test monofilament that is liable to be set into      loops on the reel and snarl easily. Better is to peel off      and discard the top 30 feet of mono and replace it with one      of the new braided lines such as Spider Wire. Super-strong,      super-thin and lightweight-but "limp," unlike mono it won't      snarl or break unless you really try. Panfish can't break      it, so the kids can just horse them out of the water.    </p>    <h3>      Natural Baits    </h3>    <p>      Worms are a traditional fish bait and easy to catch.      Six-inch-long pink nightcrawlers burrow around, aerating,      tilling, and enriching the soil in every lawn and garden.      They emerge at night to deposit castings-digested      soil-above ground. They are so helpful in enriching your      soil that you wouldn't want to catch them all if you could.      You can't ...but to lure a few out, water the soil in the      afternoon. Well after dark, put on soft shoes and take a      flashlight and coffee can containing a little moist soil      out to the yard. Walk softly. When you see a crawler half      out of its hole, approach slowly and silently, placing each      foot deliberately without thumping the ground. Grab quick,      hold firmly, and pull gently till it lets go ...or you'll      break it in half.    </p>        <p>      Red (manure) worms are smaller, much more wiggly and      brittle than crawlers, so they're hard to put on a hook.      But, they are well suited to panfish. You'll find them day      or night at the soil-line beneath old manure piles or      compost heaps. An even better source is a year-old pile of      newspapers or (uncomposted) leaves or grass clippings.      You'll often find the bottom few inches of leaves or      clippings or the lower newspaper sheets layered like a      book, with red worms between each layer. Pick out the      larger ones and leave the small ones to grow up.    </p>    <p>      If you raise rabbits or poultry in cages, release a few red      worms in the dropping pile. Scatter leaves, grass      clippings, or garden scraps under the cages from time to      time, mix to aerate, and keep uniformly moist but not wet,      and shortly you'll have a worm farm.    </p>    <p>      For some reason, medium-sized pink worms really like to      hang out under fiat rocks. I collect thin, fiat rocks and      use them for paths and a semi-permanent mulch in and around      the garden. Flipping one over, any time of day or night,      will show where worms have dug their burrows up to the flat      surface ...so the top of the burrow is open once the rock      is removed. And, there are always one or more worms there.      I can harvest each flat rock several times a year. Short      lengths of board collect worms just as well, and sheets of      black plastic mulch work too, as well as bales of old hay.    </p>    <p>      You can buy red worms by mail, but they don't all travel      well. Alabama worms aren't acclimated to Minnesota winters,      and vice versa. It has something to do with the depth they      dig down for winter. I recommend harvesting local stock      from under flat rocks if you want to build up a good worm      herd.    </p>    <p>      To keep worms alive and squirming, punch tiny air holes      through bottoms and around sides of a coffee can and fill      with forest loam, compost, or peat moss. Keep cool, covered      (worms will all crawl out at night if you don't), and moist      but not wet. Scatter cornmeal on top every few days and      worms will live happily between fishing trips.      Incidentally, you will lose more worms but catch more fish      if you hook them just once through the middle and let them      wiggle in the water.    </p>    <p>      Pork rind is a bait made when a hook is stuck through the      front end of a fork-tailed ribbon cut from the skin left      from a chunk of salt pork, fatback, or chunk bacon. Fish      are presumably attracted to the flapping of the rind      through the water, its meaty flavor, and the salt in it. A      good pork rind will last all day. But unless you raise your      own hogs, it's hard to find genuine pigskin these days,      when meat all comes trimmed, precut, and sealed in plastic.    </p>    <p>      You can buy pork rinds in bottles. I make my own      approximation from the skins removed from fish. Catfish      hide is toughest, though flatfish skin will do. I split the      tubular catfish skins, trim fins and heads off all skins,      and lay them flat in a wood-slat box between layers of rock      salt. After a few weeks they shrink and toughen. Moistening      them if they've gotten brittle, I trim them into strips-two      to three inches long and a half-inch to an inch wide and      cut forks into some, divide the ends of others into four or      five strips or leave them intact, depending on shape of the      skin. They will keep forever and regain plasticity if      stored (in a cool place, out of the sun) in loosely covered      jars containing saturated salt solution (dissolve as much      salt as the water will accept). I add red and green food      coloring to the water to make the strips look less like      dead fish skins. I'm convinced that this helps attract      panfish.    </p>    <p>      You can also buy a modern approximation of old-time dough      bait ...a kind of gumdrop-shaped blob ...dyed in dayglo      colors ...imbued with the artificial odor and flavor of      cheese, beef blood, or fish ...and packed in plastic bags.      I make my own by adding a little salt and enough water to a      cup or two of flour to make a stiff dough. If it's      available, I dose the water with meat blood, ripe cheese,      crushed garlic, a bouillon cube, or any other aromatic      edible that comes to hand. Then (just as when making      bread-flouring my hands to keep the dough from sticking) I      knead it until it is stiff and plastic with an oily sheen      on the outside. (This is more kneading than bread      wants-dough overworked like this would bake into a rock.)      Then I roll it out into half-inch-thick sausage-rolls, cut      it into half-inch lengths, and roll these into dough balls.      I flour them well to keep them "unstuck together," and      freeze till the next fishing trip. Its best to use 'em all.      Left in a cupboard, refrigerator-or tackle box dough balls      are easily forgotten and will sprout a variety of colorful      molds that attract neither fish nor fishermen.    </p>    <h3>      Artificial Lures    </h3>    <p>      I have two gigantic tackle boxes holding two spinning rod      and reel combination, several tiny black-gnat dry flies, a      half dozen spinning lures, and assorted hooks, sinkers,      leaders, and floats-which is all the gear that I really      use. The rest, perhaps 30 pounds (at $4 per half ounce      lure), is proof if you need it that fishing tackle is      intended more to attract fishermen than fish.    </p>    <p>      To go panfishing from shore, each fisherperson needs: only      a spin-casting rod and reel with 30 feet of good line and      100 yards of backup in case Moby Dick bites; one each #2      and #4 snelled bait-holder hooks (with a loop-ended length      of clear monofilament attached and barbs on the shank as      well as the tip of the hook); splitshot weights; a      medium-sized bobber/casting float; a yard-long length of      leader with a black-gnat fly at one end and a loop at the      other ...and bait. Take along a live fish basket and a      good-sized landing net with a long handle, some bug dope,      suntan cream, and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich lunch.    </p>    <p>      As indicated elsewhere, go where the fish are when they are      most likely to be biting. Cut off the end foot of line and      tie a loop by doubling over the end and making a granny      knot. Put the loop in the line through the looped end of      the snelled hook, pass the bait and snell through the loop      in the line, pull tight, and you have an unbreakable, but      easily released, square knot. Bait hook, put on one or two      split shot just above loops and a float about a foot      higher, and sling it out where the fish are dimpling the      water. If baits don't work, affix the leader and fly to the      end of the line. Put a casting float about two feet from      the fly and use it to get the fly out to the fish. If      panfish don't take black gnats, they aren't eating      anything.    </p>    <p>      Strike back-jerk lightly to set the hook when the bobber      goes under. If you don't catch a fish by jerking at the      first little bob, wait till the second ...then the third      ...then wait till you get a real strong bob ...then two.      Finally, wait till the fish pulls the bait off a way and      stops. When the bobber starts to move again, strike hard      and be ready for fun because you've caught a black bass and      it may be a lunker. Keep the rod tip up, the line tight,      and let the fish run against the drag to tire it out. Crank      in, let it run, crank in, and so on till you or a helper      can net it.    </p>    <p>      Grasp a really big fish tight by the lower jaw or behind      the gills, remove the hook with pliers, and let it go if      you can bear to. If your eight-year-old hooked it and has      to show it to his friends, big fish make good eating too. A      whole, gutted bass is perfectly wholesome after several      days in the refrigerator (including repeated, if brief,      show-and-tells) or for a month in a water bath in the      freezer.    </p>    <p>      You may have to adjust height of bait off the bottom by      moving the float on the line. You may have to change baits.      You may have to change fishing spots, fishing water,      fishing times. But you will catch fish nearly every time      out. Once in a while you will fill the stringer twice over.    </p>    <h3>      Where to Look    </h3>    <p>      Don't fish were you'd most like to swimdeep, cold lakes and      fast-moving streams with sparkling clear water, clean sandy      bottoms-and few, hard-to-locate, even harder-to-catch      roving (pelagic) fish. Look for panfish water: warm,      shallow, slow moving with a mud,bottom and murky, green      water that supports a lush growth of lily pads and pond      weeds, that teems with turtles and newts and hums and      buzzes and hops and pops on hot days with creepers and      crawlers. Muddy water is tine for catfish that grope the      bottom with barbels on their mouths, but the best fishin'      water for slab-sided fish is dark and clear but rich with      the algae that feed the small fry that feed your quarry.    </p>    <p>      Ponds and coves and backwaters in lakes can be your best      panfish source, especially if they are a good hike from any      road. Casual fishermen tend to wet a line in water they can      see from the car, and sport fishermen go for big water or      fastmoving streams. Farm ponds are good (but get      permission). But, be sure that any fishing water in farm      country is clean of agricultural chemicals. Any dangerously      poisoned water will be posted by the EPA or local      environmental agency, but I don't fish in proximity to any      commercial farmland. A topo map will show you if a pond is      downhill (and downstream) of farm fields or large stock      lots.    </p>    <p>      Look for wide stretches of slow water in rivers-especially      the inside of wide bends where the flow slows to deposit      silt so pond weed and reeds can grow to offer fish some      cover. If your river runs through a small town, fish      upriver or no less than a mile downstream. If it runs      through an industrial city, don't fish downstream at all. I      needn't remind you that, as predators well up in the food      chain, panfish can accumulate chemical pollutants in their      fatty tissues. We've come a long way since every sewer and      factory dumped raw waste into the nearest water body. But      pollutants have sunk deep into the bottom sediments under      many water bodies and fish can be contaminated for decades      after direct pollution has been stopped. Truly dangerous      waters will be posted along popular swimming and fishing      beaches (but not at every country road-crossing). Look for      signs nailed to trees along the waterway.    </p>    <h3>      When To Go    </h3>    <p>      If there is a single rule to successful panfishing, it is      to go when the fish tend to be feeding most actively.      Seasonally, early spring is best-as fish are emerging from      winter's lethargy and fueling up for the breeding season.      But in much of the country, that's when bugs are biting,      weather is raw, and country roads muddy. Next best is the      fall, when the fish are fattening up for winter. Weather is      glorious, with no bugs, good roads, and when chilly      mornings offer a welcome break from the past summer's heat.    </p>    <p>      Weather systems influence fish behavior as much as our own.      They are less cooperative in low pressure, and a gray or      rainy day. Steamy hot days warm the shallows, so they go      deep to find shade. Best is when a low is moving out and a      fresh high pressure system is moving in. Often, I've had      the fish begin biting just as the last rain clouds are      replaced by a bright sun and clearing sky. Also, vice      versa.    </p>    <p>      Most important is time of day. From an hour before sunrise      to an hour after is best. Fish are hungry and moving as      water temperatures and light conditions change. In the heat      of a late-summer day, fishlike sensible people-seek shade,      a ham mock, and a tall drink. They think of feeding again      in the evening-and the next best fishing times are the      hours before and after sunset. I find that night fishing      when the moon is big and bright can be phenomenal.    </p>    <h3>      Where The Fish Are    </h3>    <p>      As Richard Dreyfus's character put it in the movie Jaws,      sharks (and sunfish) are interested in two things: eating      and making little fish. Real food items or clever      imitations are the best bait. Minnows, crayfish, water      nymphs (aquatic larvae of may flies and other insects), and      other "naturals" are best. Minnows are the most consistent      panfish catcher I know of. Don't use bought minnows unless      they come from the water you'll be fishing. Introducing      alien fish species-even minnows-can upset the ecology of a      pond, and it is illegal almost everywhere. You can make or      buy a minnow net (a sort of gauze-covered umbrella). Smear      the center with flour water paste, sink in the water and      pull up after a short wait. You'll need a small bubbler or      a minnow bucket to keep the water aerated.    </p>    <p>      In Jaws, Dreyfus also introduced the notion of      territoriality. Even a bluegill will stake out a little      piece of turf for a feeding zone, a lair, or a nest site,      and will attack any intruders. They prefer to lurk in or      near cover where they can ambush prey or find quick escape      from larger predators. Look for what fishermen call      "structure"-sunken logs or snags, rock piles or beaver      houses especially along the shore. Weed beds are good cover      and fish will lurk along the edges and near clear holes in      the weed bed-the easier to spot prey.    </p>    <p>      Look for drop-offs where bars, flats, or ledges fall off      into deeper water-where the tops of underwater weeds or      light shallows suddenly change to deep water. Fish like to      lurk in the weeds or cruise the edge of the shoal, but have      deep water handy for their own escape from bigger fish that      are cruising the same pattern ...but after them, not      minnows.    </p>    <p>      Sunfish will betray their presence by rising to the surface      to taste most any small critter that falls in the water;      indeed, "terrestrials"-land-dwelling insects, frogs and      such-are a favorite food, especially when they are most      abundant in late summer and early fall. You may see fish      making small dimples in the water. If not, catch a      grasshopper and flick it as far out as you can. Its kicking      should attract any nearby panfish.    </p>    <p>      Sex is a powerful attractant and though many fish stop      eating during the nesting season-you can catch panfish by      passing a lure over their nests. They see it as a danger to      their eggs and attack. Most panfish nest in the spring.      You'll often see the nests just offshore: small dishes in      the bottom where a fish has dug out clay to expose clean      sand to host its eggs.    </p>    <h3>      Cleaning    </h3>    <p>      Keep your catch alive and frisky in a wire mesh,      collapsible fish basket suspended in the eater rather than      hanging from a hole in the lower jaw or by the tender gills      off a cord or wire stringer. Pour water splashily (to      aerate it) into a big pail or garbage can to keep them      alive during the trip home.    </p>    <p>      In the backyard, set up a one- or two person cleaning      production line on a table covered with newspaper that you      can dispose of along with the fish blood and other yuck.    </p>    <p>      You need a very sharp, thin knife; a clipboard-style      cleaning board with a clamp at the top; and for catfish, a      set of fish cleaning or side-cutting pliers and a glove      with metal cleats or sand grains embedded in the palm to      grip the slippery critters.    </p>    <p>      To clean a catfish, bop it hard on the top of its flat head      with the tang of the knife, and cut shallowly just through      the leathery skin all around the head behind the gills. Put      the head in the clamp, cut off fins and tail, and, with the      pliers, loosen skin all around the cut and pull backwards.      It will come off in a sleeve, bringing most of the guts      with it. Snip out any innards remaining in the body cavity      and toss the drumstick in lightly salted water to remove      any muddy flavor. Heads and innards go in a bucket to be      buried (deep) under the corn, Indian style.    </p>    <p>      Don't clean flatfish like my grandfather did-by scaling and      gutting them and forcing you to eat the skin and "tongue"      every bite for bones. Even small fish should be filleted      and skinned, which is really faster than the      gutting/scaling operation. Indeed, you never see the fish's      plumbing at all.    </p>    <p>      Bonk a fish on the head and stick the head in the      cleaner-board clamp. With the filleting knife, cut through      skin and scales in a crescent just behind the gills and      down the back along the backbone to the tail. Insert the      knife into the backbone cut and gently separate the filet      from the bones. Turn the fish on the board and filet the      other side. Discard head, bones, tail, and innards. Clamp      each filet to the board, skin down, and, cutting at a very      shallow angle, slice meat from skin.    </p>    <p>      Wash meat nuggets in fresh water, save skins for fish bait,      and bury heals and the rest under squash hills or the bean      poles. Dig deep, stomp hard on the fill, and don't leave so      much as a dribble of fish yuck on top of the ground, Or      night critters will exhume it.    </p>    <p>      Catfish hunt by tasting the water and are traditionally      caught with smelly bait-the stronger the smell, the      better a bait's reputation ...among fishermen at least. I      like to pre-bait hooks with hunks of meat or fish and leave      them in the sun for a day or two to develop a high odor. In      fact, catfish will eat anything, and will choose worms or a      fresh minnow as often as a smelly bait.    </p>    <h3>      OI' Whiskers    </h3>    <p>      Most catfish lie low during the day and hunt at night.      During the day you can lure them out of hiding with a      strong-smelling bait, but fishing is most effective at      night. If you have a boat you can go "jug fishin'." Save up      plastic milk or juice containers-the one-gallon kind      with handles are best. Cut a length of stout cord long      enough to reach the bottom, and then some. Tie one end to      the handle and fix a hook to the other. Be sure the jug is      watertight and the cap is on to stay. In the evening, crimp      a split shot or two above each hook, bait, and drop floats      along the edge of weed beds. Next morning, row out and      collect dinner.    </p>    <h3>      Extracting Hooks    </h3>        <p>      To get a badly stuck hook out of a fish's gullet, always      carry a set of needle-nosed/side-cutting pliers, available      at any hardware store or (for double the price) at any      sporting goods counter. A good example of the right tool      for the job, the pliers can get hooks out with no harm to      the fish you want to release in cases where yanking or      trying to extract the hook without a tool would kill the      fish and/or get the hook's barbed end stuck in your finger.    </p>    <p>      If a hook does get stuck in your hide deep enough that the      barb is all the way in, there is only one way to remove it      in the field: that's to push it around and out through the      skin. Fortunately, most hooks get caught in fingers and are      easily removed ...but if one snags anywhere near an eye,      get to the nearest emergency room. Any hook buried deep      also requires medical attention-both to remove the hook      with minimal tissue damage and to administer a tetanus shot      for the dangerous puncture wound.    </p>    <p>      Every tackle box should contain a small first aid kit.      First, douse the wound area and protruding shank of the      hook with disinfectant. To remove the hook, hold the stuck      member tight and grab the protruding shank of the hook with      the pliers. Pull the barb back and out as far as you can      (so back-pointing barb pulls against skin) so it is as      shallow in the skin as possible. Then-keeping the arc the      hook-end describes as it moves as tight as you can-rotate      shank around so the barb pushes up, through and out,      necessarily making a new hole through the skin. With the      wire cutters, snip off the barb and rotate the now barbless      hook back out. Encourage the wound to bleed out and it      should heal with no problem. Bandage and forget it.    </p>    <p>      This process sounds gruesome but is routine for experienced      fishermen. I find that kids accept the procedure with teary      bravado when it is explained carefully, when you praise      them for being really brave, get it done quickly, if they      don't have to look till its over, and when the      alternative-an end to the fishing trip and a $250      expedition to an emergency room in town-is explained to      them. The wound will throb for a while, but the pain is      forgotten quickly if the fishing is good. If the wound is      more than barely noticeable the next day-especially if it      is hot, discolored and swollen badly-see a physician.    </p>    <p>      For fishing with small children, I recommend the little      barbless salmon-egg or fly hooks used to give trout an      edge. They don't hold fish as readily as barbs-the kid must      maintain even pressure on the line-but they slip right out      of a small child's finger, or more commonly, his pants or      your shirt or the dog's foolish mouth-when your favorite      three-year-old feeds his worm to Yarpley. Don't laugh, it      happened to me some years back-but with a barbed hook. The      dog in question persisted in attacking porcupines, so was      used to oral-pharyngeal surgery, but your hound may not be      so dumb and could resist hook extraction with full-toothed      canine vigor.    </p>
