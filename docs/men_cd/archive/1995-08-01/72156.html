                <p>      <strong>ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>A Quiet Revolution in Photovoltaic Power      Has Made the Dream of Renewable Energy a      Reality.</strong></strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Michael Potts    </h5>        <p>      John Schaeffer, president of Real Goods of Ukiah, CA, and      his wife<br />      Nancy have just taken a great leap towards electrical      independence<br />      by installing one of the first utility-tied PV systems      featuring new,<br />      high efficiency Midway Labs modules. Midway's story.    </p>        <p>      Perhaps no other endeavor has captivated the 0minds of      MOTHER readers as much as living independently, free of the      indentured servitude of the electrical grid. For nearly      half a century, the photovoltaic cell, generating DC power      solely from the rays of the sun, has represented one of the      best avenues to that independence. At long last,      developments in those renewable energy systems have made it      easier for us to live within our solar income while      maintaining our quality of life ...and without first      obtaining a degree in electrical engineering. As appliance      energy-efficiency continues to improve, better appliances      made more easily available to energy-conscious buyers, and      new equipment for managing homegrown energy (and selling      the excess to the local power company) finally taking the      intimidating learning curve out of system installation, the      dream of decentralized generation is now. Off-the-gridders      are being joined by nations and municipalities in declaring      this to be the year renewable energy becomes the people's      power choice.    </p>        <p>      Can a home PV system, designed to be integrated into and      complement your existing grid power (see diagram at right),      ever pay for itself? Yes, if the utilities agree to pay you      for the excess power you produce at the same rate that they      charge you for their own power. The chart assumes modest to      moderate initial system cost of $6,000, a kilowatt-hour      cost of 13  cents in the first year, and a conservative      annual increase of 5 percent thereafter. For example, a      kilowatt-hour of electricity in 2025, the endpoint of my      projection, would cost 54.3  cents. Batteries for the system      will need to be replaced every 10 years at a cost of about      $1,000, and results in the saw-tooths in the break-even      line.    </p>    <p>      Only a tiny fraction of a percent of American homes-just      over a hundred thousand-are off the electrical grid and      renewably self-sufficient, but that trend is quickly      changing. Programs designed to defrock the electric      priesthood by demystifying electricity, once attended only      by supposed environmental radicals, are now filled to near      capacity by tens of thousands nationwide, who quickly learn      how safe, simple, and rewarding it is to play productively      in the energy game. At the same time, the stakes have never      been higher: Electric rates poise on an uncertain brink,      and no one predicts that they will ever fall again. The      power brokers in this game of redefining our national      energy resources will still be the utilities, but they will      have to transcend their role as primary providers and      eventually come to terms with the fact that power has to      flow from where it is most naturally derived: from our      south facing roofs, seasonal streams, and windy      promontories where it is still free for the taking.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>New Power Sources</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      While awaiting a dramatic breakthrough in power-source      technology, energy hobbyists and others who produce their      own power have been happy to see incremental improvements      in electrical source technology-smaller, quieter,      affordable wind turbines, refined micro-hydro, and enhanced      photovoltaic (PV) systems appearing in the past few months.      Stepwise refinements in PV efficiency, yield, and packaging      have decreased electrical cost per watt of installed      systems-generation, control, and storage-by about a dollar      from over five dollars a watt in 1993 to four dollars and      change today. Systems that might produce a kilowatt-hour of      electricity for 32  cents in 1992 may now produce a      kilowatt-hour for less than 30  cents. Federal neglect for      renewable energy programs continues to be, according to      insiders, the secret strength of the alternative energy      industry. Proudly unsubsidized, we get where we're going      under our own power. Changes in PVs include minor tuning of      module frames, larger cell size (up to six inches from four      inches circa 1990), utilization of more of each cell, new      collection strategies (vertical traces in laser-etched      channels reduce the amount of cell shaded by the trace),      and better antireflective coatings. Silicon, a material      mastered because of transistor technology, remains the best      material for large-scale development, and current      technology approaches the practical limitation of that      material's capabilities. Silicon cells are very good right      now.    </p>    <p>      Current improvement efforts focus more on the way light      gets to the cells than on improving photo-cells themselves.      Higher efficiency cells can be made, but the cost of making      them appears to be irreducible, so the challenge is to make      these cells work harder. By using fresnel lenses and      mirrors to concentrate sunlight as much as three      hundredfold onto small, highly efficient photovoltaic      cells, manufacturers have just begun entering the      marketplace with concentrating modules which promise a      breakthrough in yields, but do add to system complexity.      Concentrators must be pointed squarely at the sun to within      a degree or two to accomplish their light amplification,      which pushes cutting-edge tracker technology to its limit.      Since conventional flat-plane one-sun modules have      encountered problems in their adhesives, coverings, and      substrates when subjected to the stresses of collecting      sunlight over a prolonged period extending to a half      century, we can imagine how these problems will be      compounded by several-hundred-sun modules whose cells      absorb light and heat intensified by two orders of      magnitude. Since production concentrator modules have yet      to see a year in the field, pioneers who are installing      these devices can only hope the problems have been well      solved (see accompanying sidebar).    </p>    <p>      In Europe and Asia, a different strategy is being employed.      In Germany, glass roofs and south-facing curtain walls of      new buildings are now covered with photo-active materials.      In Japan, low efficiency roofing tiles are making building      tops into power farms. Swiss schools are graced with      fanciful sculptures of PVs to introduce children to the      inevitability of renewably harvested electricity. Observers      of the global energy scene worry that America's      fossil-fuel-only policies are hurtling us toward an      inevitable wall.    </p>    <p>      For those wishing to generate some or all of their own      electrical power, an additional source of real excitement      this year centers around new controller-inverters (which      change solar panel-generated 12 or 24 volt DC power into      120 volt AC household current) that make it possible to      plug alternative energy sources directly into the grid and      get paid for our production. Grid-intertie technology has      been available but pricey for at least a decade, but until      recently has not offered a satisfying solution for a small,      self-powered home system. As MOTHER first reported in our      December/January 1994 issue [#141], however, industry      leader Trace was set to introduced their SW 4024 inverter,      a four-kilowatt 24-volt device perfectly suited to home      energy co-generation that promised to revolutionize the      field. Performance of the unit in its debut year has lived      up to expectations. Controlled by a microprocessor, the      4024 has shown itself capable of choreographing all the      entities in a complex hybrid power management scheme, from      PV arrays, wind and micro-hydro generators through battery      charging to control of a backup fossil fuel-fired generator      to keep the system alive. These units incorporate all the      controls we need to be our own utility, allowing small      independent power producers (IPPs) to actually pump excess      power back into the grid. Since most electric meters are      simple electromechanical devices which turn whichever way      the current flows, guerrilla power producers can simply      install one of these units and spin electric meters      backwards without the utility's knowledge. Because of real      dangers to utility workers and the federal fines of up to      $30,000 per incident, we do not recommend this course.    </p>    <p>      On the horizon: smaller and friendlier balance-of-system      components, self-contained renewable power systems,      photoactive shingles for new roofs, and even tiny on-board      inverters that convert direct-current PV electricity into      alternating house current so that modules can be directly      connected to a home's wiring.    </p>    <p>      Some of the most exciting action has been precipitated by      the easy availability of home-scale power management      equipment. PURPA, the Carter-era law, requires utilities to      buy privately generated electricity at "avoided cost." Some      utilities, recognizing that the contribution is small and      perfectly coincident with their peak load requirements,      have adopted a generous "net metering" policy, whereby the      IPP's meter spins in the utility's favor when the customer      consumes electricity, and in the customer's favor during      excess production. Revealing dinosaurian shortsightedness,      most utilities require IPPs to provide two meters, buying      kilowatts for a pittance and selling them next door for      four times as much. Public utility regulators in several      states, including Minnesota and Wisconsin, have ended the      argument by mandating equal metering for small producers.      Fairness probably falls somewhere between, as in the      European models in which utilities pay about 85 percent of      the retail rate to IPPs. This is a favorite issue of mine,      and a great opportunity for exerting pressure on state      regulators.    </p>    <p>      As massive large-scale generation projects become rarer and      more problematic, equitable treatment for local small      independent power producers will become more important in      comprehensive utility planning. Conventional grid engineers      like to point to "problems" of integrating many, small,      independent producers, but others regard these as      opportunities to reform and improve electrical service,      which has declined in reliability in recent years.    </p>    <p>      This winter, along California's windy north coast, a series      of storms felled hundreds of unhealthy exotic trees across      Pacific Gas & Electric's aging and overextended power      lines, plunging 100,000 customers into darkness for as long      as six days. In 1980, such a prolonged outage was      unthinkable, but during this "disaster," PG&E      executives admitted that they and other large Utilities      have reduced crews, laid off dedicated veteran linemen, and      neglected maintenance for economic reasons. "Islanding,"      cited by the same engineers as the greatest danger of      decentralized power generation, can be a problem during      maintenance. In the classic islanding scenario, a small      pocket of homes at the end of a branch line might remain      energized during an outage affecting all their neighbors      because one or more of them had IPP arrangements with the      utility. The utilities must then be able to      dispatch-turn on and off the contributions of small      power producers the same way they dispatch their larger      generation assets in order to bring local lines down for      maintenance. But such a problem is not nearly as complex to      remedy as the utilities would have us believe.    </p>    <p>      The grid, extending right down to the point where house      current is delivered to the ratepayer's buss-bar and      electric meter, is designed to follow the historical      precedent in which all power comes from a few large,      distant, point sources-nuclear, hydro, wind- and PV-farms,      or fossil-fueled plants under the control of the utilities      and their peers. Since electricity cheerfully flows from      wherever it's in surplus to anywhere it's required,      redesign of these systems to accommodate many smaller local      sources is practically trivial, involving no changes to      big-ticket infrastructure like power lines and      transformers, only minor changes to utility switching      equipment. Since utilities across the country already      employ their own renewable systems to energizing sagging      transmission lines, the technology is obviously available.      In fact, simple technological measures can turn the      "danger" of islanding into an opportunity for small      isolated communities to be electrically self-sufficient      during the inevitable grid failures which will become more      common in the future. In my view, the grid, once it becomes      a mechanism for moving power democratically between      sustainable sources and those who need to light the      darkness, will eventually be considered a treasure, not a      liability, by our children, provided reforms to its      structure are begun now.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Planning For Power</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Batteries, the only cost-effective storage technology,      continue to be the weakest link in stand-alone systems.      Proponents of flooded lead-acid batteries, a technology      nearly a century old and as common as the battery in your      car, say that these units are more than adequate, providing      efficient storage with only modest attention. Incremental      improvements are doubtless possible, but since bulk energy      storage is such a small part of the battery market,      manufacturers are only now, with the promise of electric      vehicles on the horizon, beginning research in improved      energy density and deep-cycling longevity.    </p>    <p>      Even utilities, traditionally stolid and conservative      champions of massive power schemes, are getting into the      domestic scale act: In Sacramento, California, the      Municipal Utility District's "Give Us Your Roofs" program      continues to be oversubscribed by homeowners willing to pay      more for sustain ably harvested electricity. Rather than      extending power lines gracelessly across the landscape,      Southern California Edison and other giant utilities are      offering home power systems exactly like the ones that      off-the-gridders have been installing for a decade.    </p>    <p>      Disasters in California, the upper Mississippi, Hawaii, and      Florida have made many homeowners aware that it is nice to      have enough electricity to pump a little water, listen to      emergency bulletins on the radio, and see in the dark. At      the same time, increased availability and simplicity of      small-scale applications for remote water pumping, power      for seasonal cabins and wireless communications, and other      standalone electrical applications are thrusting      photovoltaics into public awareness. By far the largest      proportion of new solar cells manufactured each year go to      power calculators and watches, but more off-the-grid      swimming pool pumps and roommates, attic fans, garden      fountains, pool aerators, cabin electrical systems, and      roadside communications stations have been installed in the      last t? months than in all previous years.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Conservation The Measure of      Success</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Controlling the energy we consume continues to be, for all      of us, the single most productive way to making renewable      energy a reality, and a necessary prerequisite for a      stand-alone power co-generation or a grid-deprived remote      community. In the face of an unprecedented housing crunch      recently, huge and poorly designed retail outlets have      gobbled up Juneau, Alaska's comfortable surplus of sustain      ably generated hydroelectricity, forcing them to increase      their awkward petroleum addiction. In Juneau and elsewhere      across the country, citizens, ratepayers, and power company      officials are wondering how long will it be before we learn      that we must reduce waste before we try to reform      production?    </p>    <p>      And the market is just beginning to respond in force. New      appliances continue to perform better while consuming less      and less energy, enlarging the Conservation Power Plant. If      we follow our energy dollar, starting with our most      outrageously wasteful habits, space heating and cooling,      refrigeration, domestic hot water, and lighting, it becomes      clear that at least half of the power consumed in the home      is virtually wasted on inefficient appliances and      technology. Opportunity for efficiency is abundant: Total      consumption can consistently be reduced by at least that 50      percent mark in most American homes. Windows are commonly      our most wasteful appliances; replacing antique single-pane      glass with high efficiency windows reduces heating and      cooling costs by 50 to 70 percent in almost every climatic      regime. New windows are as much as eight times as resistant      to heat loss as traditional glass.    </p>    <p>      When an appliance is shown to be as blatantly wasteful as      the single-pane window, conscientious energy minders      replace it. Even break-even analysis, a technique usually      resorted to by apologists for petroleum and nuclear      exploitation to explain why nothing should be done, shows      that all costs of rewindowing can be paid back within an      average of three years, with everything considered. Those      who have rewindowed report unexpected rewards: Unusable      space near large windows has been reclaimed, and depressing      window coverings can be abandoned, improving day lighting      and reducing cabin fever. They say that rooms feel bigger,      quieter, more secure. Schemes for community rewindowing are      being tested and perfected in Alaska, Pennsylvania, and      elsewhere. Similarly, improved refrigerators;      solar-assisted instantaneous water heating; halogen task      lighting; and smaller, brighter compact fluorescent bulbs      make conservation ever easier. Not only will the business      of producing more efficient appliances ultimately help      those very appliance manufacturers, but also utilities and      consumers, as they begin to breathe easier, no longer under      the gun of half-century-old technology.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Reinventing the Solar      Panel</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      When the French scientist Edmund Becquerel discovered that      mere sunlight falling on certain materials produced a      steady flow of electricity, the American Revolution was      about 50 years old. His quiet invention of photovoltaics      (PV) drifted through academic halls, virtually      unexperimented with, until the space program began to      gather steam in the early 1950s, and the modern,      silicon-based solar cell was born. That cell, composed of      single crystal silicon and a supporting base of metal or      composite with positive and negative terminals, has since      enjoyed varying, though more substantial government and      private research and development, but the basic design and      that design's overall capabilities haven't really changed      substantially. Manufacturers have managed to make cells and      solar panels, collections of cells on a supporting surface,      a bit more efficient-about two percent more with each      decade-but never has the PV industry experienced the kind      of breakthrough that demands headlines and turns the heads      of those who already have an investment in conventional,      "on the grid" power. This year may bring exactly that brand      of change.    </p>        <p>      In just about the most unlikely place imaginable, the cold      and wind of Chicago, Midway Labs and its seven employees      announced in mid 1994 the design of the PowerSource, a      solar collector which was not only less expensive than      conventional panels to purchase and install, but promised a      20 percent increase in electrical output. After less than a      year on the market, our research has shown that Midway has      indeed managed to do what companies with a hundred times      their research power couldn't: make more efficient PV      available and affordable. But the revolutionary design that      makes the system possible might well be part of an enduring      problem for Midway down the road.    </p>    <p>      Where conventional panels try to maximize efficiency by      encasing larger and/or more numerous cells per panel,      Midway drastically sized down their cells to little more      than one inch square and installed a series of magnifying      glasses over each. The focal point of each cell is      bombarded with light and heat energy equivalent to three      hundred suns, and results in an impressive rate of      efficiency-nearly 18 percent. That is to say, of the 710      watts of light energy striking the panel on a typically      sunny day, you'll get 127 watts of electrical energy out of      the panel. The best efficiency rate that conventional rigid      panels have been able to muster to date is about 14      percent. Midway's four percent improvement achieved in one      effort all the research and improvements in cell efficiency      for the past 20 years. Yet as far reaching as the new      collectors are, they are utterly dependent upon one piece      of technology that conventional systems often do without: a      mechanical way of finding the sun.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>The Tracker's the Thing</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Motorized sun trackers, instruments capable of aiming      panels directly at the sun throughout the course of the      day, are as old as solar cells themselves. Used with      conventional panels, they can boost system output      substantially and easily pay for their $1,000-$2,000      purchase price. Yet they are still merely an avenue of      <em>augmenting</em> <em>power</em> . If you own      conventional panels and your tracker breaks, your power      output will gradually fall off, but continue nonetheless.      PowerSource panels, however, must be aimed exactly at the      sun's center to within one degree in order to achieve      maximum output. If the tracker aims incorrectly by more      than a few degrees, the system shuts down entirely, leaving      your toast half-browned in the process. If your system is a      stand-alone, meaning that you generate all your own power      with no tie to the electrical grid, repairing that tracker      before the stored energy in the battery bank runs out      becomes something of the utmost importance.    </p>        <p>      Midway has tried to do an end run around this problem by      including a tracker with systems that both they and their      distributors sell. Thankfully, these Wattsun FS-III      trackers have an impressive reputation for reliability, but      they do add to system cost, partially negating Midway's      efforts at price reduction. The bottom line varies      according to the size of system purchased (generally, the      bigger the system, the cheaper per watt), so we decided to      go shopping for a very modest system capable of powering a      remote cabin inhabited periodically. We saved nearly $1,000      by picking a 460 watt (4module) array of PowerSource      modules and tracker at $2,859 (taxes not included) over a      450 watt (6-module) array of Siemens PC-4 conventional      panels and the same tracker at $3,979 (taxes also not      included). The system is not complete, however, until a      storage bank of batteries, a DC to AC inverter, a power      controller, and miscellaneous wiring are thrown in, adding      about $2,500 to the price of both systems. A larger system      (800-900 Watts) sufficient to power a family home that      conscientiously watches its power consumption and runs      propane for heat and refrigeration will cost approximately      $3,000 more than both system prices listed above.    </p>    <p>      Does the Midway price savings offset the odd possibility of      being left in the dark for a couple of days by a faulty      tracker? Yes and no. As much as we'd like to believe      otherwise, the process of installing your own electrical      generating system is as much an expression of technological      dependence as independence, right from the beginning. If      you are the type of person who just wants to have a      contractor come and set the whole .thing up while you      admire from afar, depending upon a motor you know nothing      about to move your panels is most definitely a perilous      proposition. But getting hands dirty from the very      beginning will reduce even serious problems to minor      annoyances in the long run, and that is why most dealers      want you to install systems yourself.    </p>    <p>      Though promised for a months, Midway has yet to publish a      more coherent version of its installation instructions. The      current version manages to do what few manuals can emulate,      making the process of assembly read more complicated than      it is. Instead, depend upon the dealers for technical      support until Midway finishes typing. Many will actually      provide a technical advisor for a modest fee. And fight off      that first wave of discouragement when the pieces arrive;      they really can be assembled by any careful person (see      "Northern Exposure" [Feb/Mar 1994, # 142] for a description      of soup-to-nuts system installation by a rank amateur).      Take into account that trackers are typically ground based.      Mounting them on the roof as you would stationary      conventional panels is a possibility, but you'll probably      end up penciling in a loss of about 200-300 square feet of      backyard, as well as the trees that keep it shady.      PowerSource modules are even more insistent upon avoiding      shade than normal ones.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Lingering Questions</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Ask anyone who has bought a new car in its first model      year, and you'll have a key to our concerns and questions      about the PowerSource modules. What quirks and unexpected      surprises can we expect along the way? If everyday wear and      tear on normal PV panels makes their usable life something      in the neighborhood of 20 -30 years, what kind of life can      we expect from a panel subject to such hugely increased      temperatures and resulting stresses? If they break 10 years      into operation, that initial price advantage is going to      seem ...very Yugo-like.    </p>        <p>      Robert Hoffman, vice president for engineering at Midway,      interrupted after the first two questions. "Testing is      ongoing with both the individual components in the module      and the entire module itself, but independent lab tests      have given us a clean bill of health for a 20-plus-year      life on module components. Any module though," he quickly      added, "experiences some minute power output variation over      the course of its life. Some actually increase output, but      most drop by about a few percentage points over the course      of their lifetime."    </p>    <p>      After taking apart one of the modules, the simplicity and      functionality of its design bears Mr. Hoffman out. The heat      extremes in the cell's "eye" do not seem to affect the      overall temperature of the module or its aluminum casing      substantially, so it should last as long as a conventional      housing. The cells are a slightly more complicated matter,      however. Each silicon cell has a metal structure and wires      incorporated into it, but the silicon expands and contracts      at different rates than the metal, and over time, this      difference can crack the cells. Robert assures that the      cells were put through particularly rigorous temperature      tests. Thankfully, a lab's ability to simulate 20 years of      temperature extremes is a lot more reliable than its      ability to simulate 20 years of bike collisions and errant      kickballs.    </p>    <p>      One last longevity question concerns Midway's price goals      over time. Are they expecting to sell for less in 1997 than      today?    </p>    <p>      Talk to almost any dealer and they'll tell you that the      prices of silicon cells and their modules have been      dropping by anywhere from 5 to 15 percent every year for      the past five, and that they expect that decrease to      continue. Hmmm. Let's see. At that rate, we should be      paying nothing for solar panels by 2005. Unfortunately,      their price-reduction mantra makes a interesting statement,      but doesn't hold water. A quick trip back through price      guides of years past indicates that if anything, prices for      a great many industry-leading models have either held      nearly rock solid or were subject to actual <em>increases      in</em> the last five years. Admittedly, we're not taking      inflation into consideration, but you get the point.    </p>    <p>      Our modest recommendation is that you stop holding your      breath until those free-fall price drops arrive. We'll bet      both module and whole system costs for      <em>conventional</em> equipment will remain relatively      stable over the next few years, though a slight reduction      is a possibility. Whatever the outcome, if Midway continues      to make a go of it, their price advantage should hold,      perhaps until the turn of the century. Their one charley      horse is the price of aluminum. Much more aluminum per      module is used in Midway's construction than in      conventional design, and if that particular metal starts to      climb significantly in price, things could get dicey.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Hoffman was quick to point out that Midway is just      beginning to gear up for production, and in no way expects      his prices to hold where they are once the market begins to      take notice. "You've got to remember that we are currently      pricing based on an output of four or five modules a day.      Once we really get going, we are gunning for a module and      tracker cost of $2-3 per Watt in as few as three years,"      That's going to be a tough goal to meet, as their prices as      of June were approximately twice that. Let's see. At that      rate....    </p>        <p>      There's no joy like seeing your<br />      second meter actually selling power back to the utilities.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Trumping the Utilities</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      On average, utilities charge $10 per foot to extend the      electrical grid to new homes. Pockets will have to be even      deeper if you want to bury your lines, an aesthetic option      that typically increases costs by 10-20 percent. The lunacy      of signing such a check when all you are paying for is a      lifetime of bills is something MOTHER has been waging war      against since 1970. Either a conventional or PowerSource      system installation-take your pick-will have already      paid for itself the moment it arrives at your remote home      and begins operating. After that, never paying another      utility bill will just be a permanent reason to smile when      you get up in the morning.    </p>    <p>      But have we finally, at long last, reached the age when      technological improvements, ease of installation, and      affordability combine to make renewable energy practical      for those already paying for their power'? Well, if the      <em>only</em> consideration whatsoever is the bottom      line-not yet. If you buy a Midway system today      sufficient to power your home, install it tomorrow, and      stop paying utility bills next month, you might pay for the      system in 15 years. But one major fluctuation in grid power      prices, one more embargo, and stand-alone solar systems      will be a practical option overnight. And there's no need      to wait even that long to enjoy the benefits of a small      system designed to <em>complement</em> your grid power. For      instance, extending your household grid to pump a distant      well, stock tank, irrigation system, or to power an      electric fence, gate, or perimeter lighting is an expensive      proposition. It is better and more inexpensively done with      a few modules. Keeping those critical appliances working,      even in the midst of a neighborhood blackout, will make you      grateful for the investment ...and sooner than you imagine.    </p>    <p>      <em><em>-Matt Scanlon</em></em>    </p>    <p>      Top    </p>
