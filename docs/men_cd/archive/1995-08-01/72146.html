                <p>      <strong>SEASONS</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>The brightest stars in the constellation accompany      the sun into summer's mythic dog days.</strong>    </p>    <h5>      By Fred Schaaf    </h5>        <p class="caption">      Photo: Michael Lustbader/Photo Researchers; Color      Illustration: Jamie Leo    </p>    <p>      What are the "dog days" (also called the cc canicular      days;' which means the same thing)? Most people know that      they are supposed to be hot and humid days of summer. Some      folks would venture to guess that they occur in August, the      month with the greatest reputation for humidity. And many      people believe that these muggy, sultry days get their name      from the idea that dogs can go mad under such meteo      rological conditions.    </p>    <p>      The truth about the name and the exact timing of the dog      days is far more complex and interesting. The dog days are      actually named after the Dog Star, the brightest star in      the constellation Canis Major-the Big Dog-and      by far brightest star in all the heavens. The Dog Star is      more properly known as Sirius (pronounced like "serious"),      a name from ancient Greek which apparently means some thing      like "scorching." But Sirius is visible in the night sky in      winter. What would it have to do with the dog days of      summer? A star that is in the sky on winter nights is also      in the sky on summer days. Of course, even Sirius is not      bright enough to be spotted readily with the naked eye in      the midst of broad daylight. But ancient skywatchers were      able to figure out that Sirius must be accompanying the sun      across the daytime sky in the summer. And apparently as far      back as hundreds of years before Christ, one explanation of      summer's heat was that brilliant Sirius was adding extra      warmth to that of the sun at this time of year.    </p>    <p>      No one is quite sure which exact dates should mark the      start and end of the dog days. Should the central date of      the period be when the sun is passing due north of Sirius      or when they rise at the same time? The former occurs on      July 2, whatever the observer's latitude-but only in      our part of history. The latter-when the sun and      Sirius rise together depends on your latitude. From 40      degrees north latitude (Philadelphia, Denver, San      Francisco) the sun and Sirius come up together on August 4      and by August 15 Sirius rises a full hour before the sun.      (From 30 degrees, it's about a week earlier.)    </p>    <p>      In light of the complexity of the situation and the      vagueness of how close the sun and Sirius have to be for      them to supposedly combine heat, it's not surprising to      hear that many dates have been suggested for the dog days.      One tradition has them occurring from July 3 to August 11.      But other lore authorities claim they begin later (even as      late as July 30) and the duration claimed for them ranges      from about four to six weeks.    </p>    <h3>      Fantastical Dragonflies    </h3>        <p>      At one time or another, most of us have seen a dragonfly      and marveled at it: hovering or darting near us, it looks      like a brightly colored needle with big whirring wings.      Perhaps we should not be surprised to learn that so      fanciful-looking a creature really does have a strange life      and abilities.    </p>    <p>      Two questions often asked about dragonflies are whether      they bite or sting people and whether they have any      practical benefits for humanity. The answers are No and      Yes. Dragonflies, and their generally smaller, more fragile      relatives the damselflies, can't sting and are not known to      bite people. They do have jaws, however, and they are quite      voracious in their use of them to bite and eat a variety of      other insects-including mosquitoes and flies, which      human beings consider pests. Which of course answers the      second question: Yes, dragonflies are quite beneficial to      us by eliminating large numbers of insects that we find      undesirable. In flight, they actually grab bugs and collect      them in their curve-dunder legs, as if in a bucket.    </p>    <p>      Dragonflies lay eggs near or in the water and in their      early, nymph stages feed on aquatic creatures and breathe      with gills-until the time comes and the adult      dragonfly bursts forth from its shell. You may have noticed      large numbers of dragonflies in August, darting back and      forth over a field after flies and mosquitoes. Is this a      concentration of the dragonflies that live around the      neighborhood? No. These impressive displays of dozens or      hundreds of dragonflies are groups from far away pausing to      feed during migration. Some of the larger kinds of      dragonfly do migrate-not thousands of miles as is      common for birds, but at least hundreds of miles.    </p>    <p>      Dragonflies can be distinguished from damselflies because      they rest with wings outstretched while most damselflies      rest with wings folded. Both varieties have four thin,      transparent, many-veined wings.    </p>    <p>      By far the most common and conspicuous dragonfly is the      green darner. This, fast, green-bodied dragonfly is most      common in the East but can be found almost anywhere in      North America that there is sufficient water.    </p>    <p>      Green darners can have bodies over three inches long and a      wingspan up to about four inches across. But dragonflies      are ancient insects-fossil remains date back to      250-300 million years ago-and some of the early      varieties were enormous. In the fossil record are      dragonflies with two and a half-foot wingspans!    </p>    <h3>      Saturn's Razor-Thin Rings    </h3>    <p>      In August, the rings of Saturn turn      sideways-"edgewise"-to Earth for a second      amazing time. But unlike in May, this time the sunlit face      of them bursts into view and the planet soon after makes      its closest approach of the year.    </p>    <p>      Getting a good view of Saturn's rings these next few months      is tricky (much depends on having a good telescope and a      night of steady atmosphere up on high). But if you like      astronomy at all you should make the effort to see this.      Not for over 40 years will similar views be visible! If you      don't have even a small telescope of your own, seek out the      public night of the nearest planetarium or amateur      astronomy club (a huge listing of planetarium and club      addresses and phone numbers can be found in the September      issue of Sky & <em>Telescope</em> magazine, which      should be available at newsstands and libraries by the time      you read this).    </p>    <p>      What will you see under excellent conditions through a      superb telescope? Until August 10, an oddly flattened      yellow globe with one or two thin dark lines across it (the      darkened, nearly edge-on rings and their shadow).      Then, in the weeks after that date, the rings slowly come      back into light and into enough tilt to become visible      first as a needle, then as a thicker line of light. You may      see moons of Saturn as little star-like beads lining up on      that needle or string of radiance.    </p>
