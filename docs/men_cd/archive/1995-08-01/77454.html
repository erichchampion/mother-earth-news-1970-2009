                <p>      <strong><strong>Maintain a year-round harvest and bountiful      table with both bolt-ans frost-resistant late summer      vegetables.</strong></strong><br />    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Brent Elswick</h5>        <p>      As the seasons change, so do the requirements for keeping      the home garden growing properly. Here in Middle America,      fall is a season to be revered. There is so much to do and      so much can be accomplished that there is no need to      consider this season of spectacular color as merely a short      interim before winter. I can assure you that gardening in      the fall can be just as productive as gardening in spring      and summer. . .and with substantially reduced mosquito      problems!    </p>    <p>      I consider myself a lucky individual to have been properly      trained by my father and uncle in how to garden:, and      harvest in the fall. All of us do our planting and      harvesting near the banks of the Big Sandy River here in      the mountains of eastern Kentucky, and that terrain poses      special challenges. I do realize that most folks will be      gardening in areas that are not as sheltered and likely'      riot as sloping, but fall gardening is easily adaptable to      nearly all situations. Though Dad has been gone for 16      years now, I can still see him walking over the riverbank      with his trusty hoe over his shoulder, ready to do battle      with the various assortment of weeds that persistently made      a nuisance of themselves. I can honestly say Dad never      tired of the constant war he engaged in. He believed      fervently in a "clean" garden-using whatever method it      took. Though hoeing is perhaps not the easiest way to keep      weeds at bay, it is one of the best and most commonly      employed. If you have the resources available to mulch      enough to control weeds, by all means, do it! If not, be      sure to keep a sharp hoe at hand.    </p>    <p>      My Uncle Red is a master gardener and has his garden near      mine over the bank. Though in his mid-80s, Uncle Red's      passion for gardening has never waned with the years. I      wish all my readers could visit his garden and this amazing      man with his trusty shovel at hand. Yes, I did say      <em>shovel!</em> Though he does use a hoe, it is absolutely      amazing how adeptly he cleans his garden with his shovel.      It's not your ordinary model either. It has a serrated      edge. You heard me right-serrated, and he put that edge      there himself, hand-filing every small notch until it was a      formidable weapon. Weeds and soil are no match for this      unique tool.    </p>    <p>      Where do you start? Good question. You start in the summer,      making your plans. Gardening without a master plan is an      invitation to disaster, so we'll begin in August. If you      plan on growing cole crops such as cabbage, broccoli, or      cauliflower, and I suggest you do, those plants need to be      started by mid-to-late summer at the latest. It's likely      you'll have to start your own, because few garden centers      offer plants of those items other than in the spring; the      only exception being the South. You can start your seeds in      flats if you like, but I usually start them right in the      ground, keeping them moist before, during, and after they      sprout.    </p>    <p>      I also like to try a few late tomatoes in the same manner.      It might be a good idea to start the tomato seeds a week or      so before the vegetables mentioned above. Though most will      mature about the same time as the majority of cole crops,      tomatoes do not tolerate frost well and flat out cannot      handle a freeze. On the other hand, most cole crops      actually thrive under cool weather conditions.    </p>    <p>      Photos By Rhonda Simpson<br />    </p>        <h3>      AFTER THE FROST <strong>Most cole crops actually thrive      under cool weather conditions.</strong>    </h3>    <p>      Such seed beds should be prepared by adding copious amounts      of soil builders such as compost, manure, and even peat      moss, which help the soil to retain moisture, even during      the August heat. After the plants are large enough to      transplant to their permanent locations, I like to choose      sites that will receive good drainage and receive proper      sunlight. While cole crops can handle some shade, tomatoes      do better in full sunlight. I know some folks have no      choice and have to make do with a shady area, and that's      okay if that's all you have. Tomatoes will produce in the      shade but not as abundantly.    </p>    <p>      All vegetables respond to rich nutrients and ample      moisture, so fall planted cole crops and tomatoes are no      exception. In addition, care should be taken to select      varieties that are resistant to diseases prevalent in your      area. In my area, it's best to go with yellow resistant      cabbage varieties and VFN resistant tomatoes. That's not to      say non-resistant stand-ups such as Early Jersey Wakefield      cabbage and Marglobe tomato won't give you a crop. They      might, but why settle for "might."    </p>    <p>      What should you choose? I thought you would never ask.      Hands down, the best-tasting cabbage is the aforementioned      Early Jersey Wakefield. If yellows are not a problem, by      all means, grow it-early or late. If yellows decimate your      cabbage patch, you might want to turn to Stonehead. Readily      available, Stonehead offers a solid head that keeps well      and has fine quality. Its name does not do it justice. It's      tender and quite delicious when steamed or sauteed. There      is also a yellow resistant Wakefield type available called      Charleston Wakefield, but it's not often available and its      quality is a shade below Early Jersey. The heads are      pointed like Jersey and larger, and quality is better than      most. Any of the three would be terrific choices. Looking      at tomatoes, I do not know that I could think of a better      choice than the venerable Better Bay or Uncle Red and Uncle      Luke's personal favorite, Super Fantastic VFN. These VFN      resistors do mature a little late, so care must be taken in      variety selection if you live in the far North. You might      then want to turn to something that matures a week or so      earlier, such as Stokes Seeds's Ultra Sweet. It's very      disease resistant and has the incredible "Taste Bud" gene      bred into it. Maturing in just 62 days, it's a terrific      choice.    </p>    <p>      To insure steady growth with fall cabbage and tomatoes, be      sure to keep them well-watered and well-fed. With cabbage,      well-fed means adding lots and lots of manure. If you want      sweet, tender cabbage, just keep the manure coming and      you'll be amazed. Now the tomato is a horse of a different      color. You don't want heavy manure here. It's loaded with      nitrogen, which tends to force tomatoes to leaf production,      rather than fruit production-a definite "no-no"with love      apples.    </p>    <p>      One of my secrets might surprise you. I get my absolutely      best tomatoes when I use Epsom salts. Don't laugh! It      works. Added to the hole at the time the plants are set out      and sprayed on as the season goes on, the salts seem to      give the tomatoes a real boost. Half a cup at planting      time, and that much added to a three gallon sprayer, will      be sufficient, though using more or less can give similar      results.    </p>    <p>      You have to experiment and find out for yourself what works      for you. While adding the salts to your spray, be sure to      include fish emulsion. Together they are a wonderful tonic      for tomatoes, as well as many other veggies.    </p>    <p>      I should add here that it is also a good idea to use the      same techniques for growing fall crops of other coles, as      well as peppers. I will take just a moment or so to      recommend a few varieties for autumn cropping.    </p>    <p>      Johnny's Selected Seeds has a fine line of cole selections.      Their Arcadia is great for fall production. Bred to      tolerate stress of all sorts, Arcadia resists both heat and      cold, making it ideal for fall crops.    </p>    <p>      Though not as heat or cold tolerant as broccoli,      cauliflower can be grown in the fall. There are varieties      more suited for such conditions. One is Johnny's Amazing.      Only available since 1994, Amazing is just that. Plan it      just right, and you can harvest the tender white heads just      ahead of freezing weather.    </p>    <p>      Brussels sprouts have long been a cold weather favorite and      Johnny has a new one that outdoes all the others. Their      Igor is likely the best cold-tolerant high-quality sprout      you'll ever try. Don't even worry about getting a harvest      before cold weather. These tasty little tidbits stay right      on the stalk well into winter before quality is lost.    </p>    <p>      How do you store your bounty? Most cabbage will take frosts      and some light freezes and retain their quality. If      extremely cold weather sets in before your crop is used up,      just select a site easy to get to in winter, pull your      cabbage (roots and all), turn them upside down, and cover      very well with a thick mulch of straw. Just dig down into      the straw after cold weather sets in and you'll have      perfect cabbage for winter use.    </p>    <p>      I wish it were that easy with tomatoes. Not so. It does      take some planning. Of course, you can pick all you want      and bring in before freezing to ripen inside. That can      include nearly all the unripened fruits. Always make sure      there are no blemishes, whether they be bruises or disease.      Either will cause the fruits to rot. I like to lay the      tomatoes in boxes, between layers of newspapers, and place      in a warm room. They will ripen and the boxes have to be      checked from time to time for those getting ripe and for      those showing decay.    </p>    <p>      Coles and tomatoes are only a couple of veggies I like to      concentrate on in the fall. One of my fall favorites is the      leek. Mostly ignored now, the leek was one of the first      cultivated veggies, and for centuries in Europe, highly      prized. I like them because they are nearly care-free.      Anyone who likes onions should give the leek a go.    </p>    <p>      I like to plant in mid- and late summer, keeping the seed      moist until it sprouts. They are best planted half-inch      deep and thinned as they grow, to about six inches apart.      The thinnings can be used as green onions and are quite      tasty. Some like to plant in trenches but not 1.1 just use      a shovel or hoe to hill dirt around as they grow. This      blanches the large edible stems, and in my experience      results in substantially better plants. Be sure to keep      well-watered and use lots of manure or compost. They winter      over quite well here, but a heavy blanket of straw mulch      will insure leeks right into spring in even colder      climates.    </p>    <p>      In the emerald valleys of Pike County, Kentucky, no home      gardener would even consider a fall garden without greens.      It just so happens that the green of choice in this area is      the mustard green. Believe me, a late fall patch of      Southern Giant Curled is a prerequisite, an absolute      essential. Here it is almost heretical to plant any other      variety. Since I like to experiment, I've tried just about      all of them. Admittedly, I like Southern Giant Curled the      best, but I've learned to enjoy others as well, Florida      Broadleaf and Tender green in particular. Florida Broadleaf      is good for warm areas as it does resist bolting, and      Tendergreen is favored by those who like spinach, as the      flavor is similar.    </p>    <p>      For our purpose, however, let's just concentrate on      Southern Giant Curled. Uncle Red grows about the best      greens I've ever seen. They are huge and bursting with that      good old-time mustardy tang. He likes to use his trusty      shovel to turn the soil and flatten it until level. He      works in patches or rows that vary. They are usually about      20 feet long and two or three feet wide. He pours on the      organic matter-whatever at hand-sows thickly, and sets back      and waits for the good eatin' to come. And it does.    </p>    <p>      Last year he also planted a row of Purple Top White Globe      turnips in the same manner. He's not much for turnips but I      am, and I dipped liberally into his patch. You should have      seen the turnips that came on later. Some were larger that      softballs. They were sweet and tender and bursting with      flavor. Sliced thinly, and cooked in a pot with sugar and      butter added, you've got yourself a tongue pleaser for      sure.    </p>    <p>      Of course, other greens do just as well. Some are even more      cold tolerant, and so, better for fall cropping, such as      kale. In our area, greens are generally planted around      August 15th, and it's not unusual to pick greens here until      Thanksgiving. Kale can be picked even longer, even when      snow is on the ground. Cultural requirements are pretty      much the same as for any of the coles or mustards.    </p>    <p>      Not to take anything away from the standard varieties      usually grown, such as Dwarf Blue Curled and Siberian      Improved, the Winterbor is probably the sweetest kale I've      tried. To that, add the fact it is among the cold-hardiest      of all greens and you've got a perfect green for fall      crops.    </p>    <p>      No fall garden would be complete without beets and carrots,      in my opinion. Both are quite versatile and can be sown at      intervals from spring to late summer. Soil requirements are      similar. Both do well in my sandy loam, but can be grown in      most soil types. Beets do well with an addition of lime      when planting, and carrots need a soil nearly free of      stones and rocks. Those can cause poorly shaped roots.    </p>    <p>      There are approximately one zillion varieties of carrots      available now, and a nearly equivalent number of beet      selections to choose from. There are carrots for fresh use      and carrots for canning. There are beets suited for      pickling and beets suited for fresh use, so it's a matter      of choice. As for storing, both are somewhat cold tolerant      (carrots more so) and seem to improve with some fall      frosts. Beets do better stored in damp sand in a cool      basement but carrots will do fine in the garden if heavily      mulched. In some cases, all that is required is a little      soil heaped on top just before hard freeze settles in. Of      course, they are easier to harvest if a nice layer of straw      is added to the top. You'll be amazed at how sweet a carrot      can be when unearthed in December. Storage seems to      increase sweeteners, rather than take it away.    </p>    <p>      I do have a few personal favorites I'd like to mention. As      for carrots, I don't believe you can beat Ed Hume's Ingot.      Nantes types have long been esteemed for their quality and      this is one of the best. This long nantes type has actually      been declared a winner in national taste tests, and should      be tried by folks looking for a good carrot for fall. The      other carrot I favor is offered by D.V. Burrell. Their      Chantenay Royal is a winner. The huge, fat roots are      bursting with flavor and seem to resist cold weather      deterioration far better than most.    </p>    <p>      Beets have long been an English favorite, and Thompson and      Morgan Seeds, the esteemed English firm with a branch in      New Jersey now, has some of the finest varieties available.      Their Rubidus (a Detroit type) all but eliminated bolting      in beets. I also like the fact they can get as big as a      softball and still not get woody. Generally, if a beet      grows larger than a baseball, it's likely to get woody and      fibrous. Not here.    </p>    <p>      Another dandy they offer is Cylinder. My wife loves this      variety because it is long, much like a carrot. This makes      it terrific for slicing. Since almost all of our beets are      used for pickling, ease of slicing is very important.      That's why I very rarely ever have to worry about storing      beets. Nearly all are used for pickled beets, an old      Elswick family favorite. I like to grow both in hilled-up      rows about a foot high. Beets rows are well lined and both      get lots of compost and manure, and they seem to thrive      under such conditions. Watering is important, since rain is      usually scarce at this time of the year. I like to make my      last plantings about the same time as greens are planted,      around August 15 in my area.    </p>    <p>      It is unfortunate that so few folks make a point to plant      vine crops in the fall. It is entirely feasible, especially      now that there are so many really good early maturing      varieties available. That's especially important with      melons, both cantaloupe and watermelon. The vine crop I      most often grow in the fall is the cucumber, which seems to      really thrive in the cooler nights of late summer and early      fall. Remember Uncle Red? Cukes are one of his specialties.      He will not grow a cuke on the ground. He trains them up a      fence where they crop tremendously. While just about any      cuke will climb, his favorite is Burpee's Green Knight.      It's a long burpless type that is especially esteemed for      sweet, tender cukes. Uncle Luke loves to pile aged manure      and compost generously around the plants. You should see      them grow. The same goes for late melons.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, one had to plant honeydews as early as      possible since maturity was so late. Now Pinetree Seeds      offers Early Dew, a super new early-maturing honeydew.      Quality is superb and unlike most honeydews, the fruits      slip from the vine when ripe. Another dandy early      cantaloupe from Pinetree is Fastbreak. Maturing in little      more than two months, it is entirely possible to get a crop      if planted by early August. Same goes for Sugar Baby, a      super early watermelon from Pinetree. Why not give melons a      shot as a fall crop?    </p>    <p>      There are some veggies that do require a long season to      mature, so fall planting isn't feasible. However, some of      those mature so late, storage is necessary in the fall. One      in particular is the sweet potato. While not grown in      nearly as many gardens as other veggies like tomatoes or      sweet corn, sweet potatoes are very popular in my part of      the country. Well-suited to our climate, they produce in      abundance here. Too often, though, finding a place to store      them is a real problem. If you have any space under your      porch or house, you could have the perfect place right      under your nose. Sweet potatoes do fine in a cool, dark      place that doesn't freeze. Most likely the heat from your      house will be all that's needed. Of course, a good      old-fashioned smokehouse would work fine, too.    </p>    <p>      Another late-blooming green that matures late and requires      a suitable storage space is the cushaw. A nook under your      house would be perfect. Hulls on cushaws are so thick, not      much protection from cold is needed. Uncle Red says he'll      often throw a blanket over his cushaws and his squash. If      covered, the cushaw can be stored in a tool house or any      sort of enclosed shed. The same goes for all sorts of      winter squash such as hubbards and butternuts. Fall is a      grand time. Make it a great season in the home garden as      well!<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>SEEDS SOURCES</strong></strong><br />      Pinetree<br />      Box 300<br />      New Gloucester, ME 04260<br />      (207) 926-3400<br />      <br />      Johnny's Selected Seeds<br />      Foss Hill Rd<br />      Albion, ME 04910<br />      (207) 437-9294<br />      <br />      DV Burell<br />      PO Box 150<br />      Rockyford, CO 81067<br />      (719) 254-3318 Burpee<br />      300 Park Ave.<br />      Warminster, PA 18974<br />      (800) 333-5808<br />      <br />      Stokes Seeds<br />      Box 548<br />      Buffalo, NY 14240<br />      (716) 695-6980<br />      <br />      Thompson and Morgan<br />      Box 130<br />      Jackson, NJ 08527<br />      (908) 363-2225    </p>
