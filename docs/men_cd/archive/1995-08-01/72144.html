                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>       <p><strong>Chicken Wire Discourages Horses from Chewing Fence    Poles</strong></p>        <h3>      Bathing Gloves Save Water    </h3>    <p>      Growing up in California, I learned at an early age that      water is precious. The first time I slept over at a      friend's house, her mother asked me why I used a cup of      water to brush my teeth. With the innocence of a      seven-year-old, I asked her why she didn't. Water prudence      is as natural to me as breathing. Beyond installing      aerators on all my faucets, constantly prowling for dreaded      leaks, and using low-flow toilets, I found a relatively      inexpensive and effective aid: bathing gloves. These gloves      are similar in purpose to loofah sponges but they don't      mildew. I now buy less soap and spend less time in the      shower, with no sacrifice of cleanliness. I have found      these gloves in several different national stores, and have      included them in gift baskets for family and friends.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Kate Christiansen</em> <em><br />      Norman, OK</em>    </p>    <h3>      Canning Cakes    </h3>        <p>      My son was away in the service on his nineteenth birthday,      but I sent him a card, a present, and a birthday cake. I      had heard of mailing cakes to servicemen that arrive all in      crumbs, but I devised this method which should be useful to      anyone who wants to mail a homemade cake.    </p>    <p>      The solution is to bake your cake in cans. One-pound coffee      cans with snaptop plastic lids are perfect. Actually, any      reasonably sized can with a nice snap-top lid is great.      Make sure you line the can with waxed paper or aluminum      foil, and pour the batter in to about % level before baking      it in the usual way. Select a solid type of cake such as a      date cake, applesauce pound cake, etc. After the cake is      baked, allow it to cool thoroughly before putting on the      lid (which helps prevent "sweating" and sogginess), then      decorate the outside of the can with gift wrap paper or      colorful scraps of wallpaper. Wrap the whole thing in clear      plastic tied at the top with a ribbon. Pack it in a box and      send it. 1t will arrive safe in one piece and, hopefully,      delicious. But that part is up to you.    </p>    <p>      <em><em>-Kay Haugaard</em> <em><br />      Pasadena, CA</em></em>    </p>    <h3>      Keep Your Horses from Chewing Fences    </h3>        <p>      Many horses chew on wooden fences, especially if they are      confined in a small area. Horses that grow up in large      pastures and have room to roam are not as apt to develop      the wood-chewing habit. But almost every horse that starts      life in a small pen or pasture, corral, or stall will chew      wood, primarily because of boredom. Some horses are such      "beavers" that they can ruin a good fence in a very short      time.    </p>    <p>      Wood preservatives, old motor oil, and foul-tasting      applications used by horse owners to protect fences will      deter some of the chewers, but not all of them. Chemicals      put on fences can be harmful or toxic if a horse does keep      chewing.    </p>    <p>      Another way to protect wooden fencing is to cover it with      small-mesh chicken wire. A net wire fence with a top pole      can be protected from horse's chewing if you cover the top      pole with chicken wire. Cut the chicken wire into strips      the proper size to go along the pole. Staple the wire at      frequent intervals so there are no loose parts or sharp      protrusions. A non-toxic wood preservative such as log oil      can be applied periodically with a brush in spite of the      chicken wire, and the poles will last a long time.    </p>    <p>      Chicken wire is not very expensive, especially when you      consider that a roll will cover a lot of fencing when cut      into the proper-size strips. It can be easily cut with tin      snips. Staples will cost a bit, since it takes quite a few      large ones to secure the wire properly so there will be no      loose portions that the horse can pull at, and no pieces of      chicken wire sticking out. All edges should be tucked      under. You need to use staples that are large enough to      hold securely and never pull out. Your time will be another      cost. But when you weigh these costs against having to      replace poles, boards, or put in new posts and redo      fencing, you'll find that chicken wire is fairly cheap      insurance for guaranteeing much longer life for wooden      fences.    </p>    <p>      <em><em>-Heather Thomas<br />      Salmon, ID</em></em>    </p>    <h3>      Tomato Plants Prefer Hanes    </h3>        <p>      I cut up panty hose into rubber bands and use them to hold      many things together. They never rot like rubber bands, and      they last forever. I use them to hold boxes together, and I      tie my tomatoes up with them. I even cut the panty part to      make large bands to hold my hair when I put on my bathing      cap or to hold my rollers on.    </p>    <p>      <em><em>- Nancy Crawford<br />      Ballston Spa, NY</em></em>    </p>    <h3>      <br />      A Tree Biologist's Advice    </h3>    <p>      I am a tree biologist and I would like to comment on Mitch      Culver's suggestion to use old car tires to hold mulch      around the base of trees (Country Lore, June/July 1995).      It's a resourceful idea, but if we place mulch within six      inches of the trunk, we increase the chances of rodent and      pathogen damage. Rather we suggest you keep mulch at least      six inches away from the trunk, and if staking is      necessary, use broad, belt-like flexible material that will      not injure the bark. You could use the tires to keep weed      eaters away, but you really don't need grass under the      tree.    </p>    <p>      <em><em>-John A.

Once we put the dog out, the skunk smell still      lingered. I remembered talking to a fur buyer once about      how to get rid of skunk odor. I tried it and it worked.      Take a steel pan, put cornmeal in it, and put it on the      stove at a high temperature. As the cornmeal burns, the      skunk odor will disappear.    </p>    <p>      <em><em>-Robert T.
