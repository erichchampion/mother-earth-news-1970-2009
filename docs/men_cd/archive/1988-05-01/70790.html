                <p>      <strong>PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Clever ways to manage the spaces between your      crops.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      <em>By Susan Sides</em>    </h5>        <p>      ©BROWNIE HARRIS    </p>    <p>      <strong>Susan and Franklin Sides (and little Walker) with      the Bearwallow Beds described in the article.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Gardeners often treat their growing areas as almost sacred      soil, while ignoring the earth directly underfoot-the      pathways. We put so much energy into tending our crops and      flowers that the spaces between the beds are mostly      forgotten. But then one day we suddenly realize that we're      forced to spend more time weeding the pathways than the      crops. <em>Or</em> we get fed up with walkways that become      as slick as boiled okra every time it rains. Or we pull      another clump of tough-rooted grass and wonder if there's      any way to keep that aisle cover from invading the      asparagus.    </p>    <p>      Sound familiar? If your paths lead to similar toils and      troubles, it's time you took a better look at just where      you stand in your own garden. Everyone wants      low-maintenance walkways that look good and make getting      around pleasant and efficient. The ideas offered here can      help you have them.    </p>    <p>      One note: Many of my techniques apply better to gardens      with beds (wide growing areas) than to those devoted to row      crops. Another note: Whatever pathway panacea you prefer,      make sure the paths themselves are wide enough to handle      the jobs you need to do. If you can't bring in a garden      cart without crushing your lettuce or can't weed the      tomatoes without sitting on the beans, you need wider paths      (18 inches is narrow, 36 is wide). You may even want to      work out an artful combination of different-sized pathways      to use space most effectively.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dirt Paths</strong>    </p>    <p>      Pathways with unusually poor soil or heavy foot traffic may      sprout so few weeds they can be left as is. (That's rarely      been my luck.) If too many unwanted plants do shoot up, you      can chop them off with a hoe. Better yet, sharpen the edge      of a flat-faced spade, run it just under the soil surface      when the earth isn't wet, and <em>skim off</em> the weeds.      Skimming's not too difficult, and the results are clean      lines with that well-manicured look.    </p>    <p>      If too much rainwater runs into your beds from the      pathways, try working on the aisles once in a while during      the wet season. Push a heavy garden fork about two-thirds      of the way into the soil, and wiggle it to create air      spaces. Repeat the process every six to 12 inches. (Either      that or redesign your garden so pathway rivulets run      through and out of the plot.)    </p>    <p>      Drawbacks: Hoeing or skimming a large garden is      time-consuming and hard on folks with bad backs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mulch</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many gardeners cover their pathways with mulch. Grass      clippings, straw, leaves or sawdust will shade out weeds,      conserve soil moisture and keep walkways high and dry. If      the mulch is thick enough, you can easily pull up any      unwanted growth that does appear. Last year's decomposed      mulch can either be tilled into the garden beds and a new      layer added, or be left in place with a pile of fresh      materials on top.    </p>    <p>      If you mulch with hay, first spread it out in an unused      area and turn it occasionally, so its seeds won't sprout in      your plot. Otherwise, pile it deep in the aisles, and flip      it over in place if some seeds sprout.    </p>    <p>      Other materials that people have used for pathway cover      include cardboard, newspaper, shredded computer printouts,      heavy paper feed sacks and carpet remnants. Commercial      growers use permeable landscape cloth to keep weeds from      growing in perennial areas. It works great on pathways,      too-but gets expensive if you've got a big garden.      All of these materials are usually covered with a layer of      organic matter.    </p>    <p>      A three-inch layer of bark chips or gravel can provide good      cover for permanent pathways, but you'll need to contain      the material with an edge barrier (discussed below) and      replenish it as needed.    </p>    <p>      Drawbacks: Organic mulches may attract and harbor slugs.      Mulch can interfere with hand-or machine-digging of beds      unless it is raked aside or contained by edging. And heavy      winds can wreak havoc on newly applied light mulch      materials.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grass Pathways</strong>    </p>    <p>      Handsome grass pathways help prevent soil erosion, moderate      soil moisture levels and even keep your shoes clean.      Richard Fry (a fine local horticulturist/landscaper)      recommends using a mixture of fescue grass and white clover      in paths. Tall fescues are tough enough to bear heavy foot      traffic, but they need frequent mowing. To reduce mowing      chores, use one of the newer turf fescues that are slower      growing and have finer blades.    </p>    <p>      You can keep the grass from invading your growing beds by      cutting it back with a spade or a half-moon edging tool.      But you'll have less work in the long run if you install a      physical barrier along your borders. It's best, too, to      plant compact plants around the edges of your garden      beds-sprawling ones will spread onto the grass,      making mowing<br />      difficult.    </p>    <p>      Drawbacks: Grass pathways require mowing and will creep      into growing areas if not contained.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sheet Composting</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sheet composting consists of tossing kitchen wastes and      other compost fare into the pathways and covering it all      with a carbon-rich material like leaves or straw.      Earthworms are attracted to the area and help the in-garden      composting process. After a season or two, the pathways are      plowed up and planted. The former growing areas become the      new pathways and get sheet composted themselves. The method      is most often used in sandy or loose soils.    </p>    <p>      Drawbacks: You have to reestablish growing beds every year      or two. And you still have to cope with weeds in pathway      areas that haven't yet been sheet composted.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>People use everything from used tire treads to      old car bumpers.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Solid Pathways</strong>    </p>    <p>      Solid pathways range from simple 1 X 12 boards placed over      the aisles of a postage-stamp-pattern garden to fine bricks      laid in a fancy herringbone pattern. Whatever materials you      use, solid pathways are a good choice for walkways that see      a lot of shoe soles and the tires of many garden machines.      Dug-up stones, slats from shipping pallets, slices cut from      round logs, and salvaged bricks or chunks of flat concrete      are some inexpensive material choices. You might even want      to fashion your own concrete stepping stones. To increase      traction, scratch their tops with a pattern, or embed      gravel or pebbles.    </p>    <p>      Purchased flagstone, bricks and concrete steps carry a      higher price tag and take some skill to lay well. But they      provide solid, lovely walkways. (You may want to use such      costly materials only in your main center path.)    </p>    <p>      Before installing a solid pathway, dig out any weeds and      grass. Once it's set, plant something low and      ground-hugging in the cracks, like creeping thyme or Roman      chamomile, so new weeds can't claim those gaps for      strongholds. Another solution is to lay down an inch of      gravel (quarry fine grade), put in your bricks or whatever,      then fill around them with two more inches of the loose      stone.    </p>    <p>      Drawbacks: If you don't use gravel or a ground cover to      keep down unwanted growth, you may get stuck with some      tedious pathway weeding. Some of the nicest materials for      solid pathways are expensive.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Edgings</strong>    </p>    <p>      At some point, the pathway ends and the growing area      begins. This border is where a good edging can help keep      the gravel out of the greens or the crabgrass away from the      carrots. Edgings are also used around garden perimeters to      separate plot from yard. Just as with pathway materials,      there's a world of choices for bed barriers.    </p>    <p>      • Commercial aluminum or plastic edgings: Richard Fry      says any store-bought edging should be at least four inches      tall and be buried securely so it won't get pushed out by      frost heaves. In fact, Fry suggests installing such thin      edgings in spring or fall. Otherwise, those put in during      summer may develop gaps at their joints when winter comes,      while ones installed in winter may buckle and bend the      following summer. (Richard also praises the metal edging      made by Ryerson Steel Company. He says it's the only edging      he's ever used that stays put, keeps grass out and should      last a lifetime. You can call Ryerson's home office in      Chicago-at 312/762-2121-to find a distributor      near you.)    </p>    <p>      • Landscape timbers: Widely available and attractive,      landscape timbers are treated with chromated copper      arsenate (CCA), a relatively safe preservative that's not      readily absorbed by plant roots. Railroad ties, on the      other hand, have been treated with creosote and possibly      pentachlorophenal. These serious toxins are taken up by      plants. So while landscape timbers make acceptable edgings,      don't use railroad ties near any food plants.    </p>    <p>      • Board borders: These can be made from scrap or      purchased wood and are installed either vertically like      commercial edging (Gardener's Supply, 128 Intervale Rd.,      Burlington, VT 05401, sells handy brackets for this job) or      horizontally. Boards laid flat should be fastened at the      ends and be at least as big as 2 X 4s: The deeper and wider      your boards, the better your control of invasive growth.      And if you lay them so that from ½ inch to a fall      inch of wood extends above ground level, a lawn mower can      do a better job of trimming the pathway grass right next to      the boards.    </p>    <p>      • Concrete blocks: Set them on their sides, and grow      flowers or other attractive plants in the holes. The lime      that leaches from blocks makes them particularly good homes      for many herbs.    </p>    <p>      • Log rounds: One- to two-foot-long log rounds can be      set perpendicularly into the ground for a nice,      rustic-looking barrier. You may want to position a few      horizontally to alter the effect and conserve wood. Log      rounds are available commercially, or you can cut your own.    </p>    <p>      • Rocks: Good size quarry rocks can be used to build      free-standing bed borders, but they need to extend well      into the ground. Rocks are beautiful but hellacious to weed      around. They're also not a solid deterrent to wandering      grass.    </p>    <p>      • Bricks: Bricks are expensive, but beautiful when      laid flat and side by side. They're easy to edge-mow and      can even be laid out in curves.    </p>    <p>      • Creative choices: People have made garden barriers      out of all sorts of things, from used tire treads (cut out      with a saber saw) to old car bumpers. Use your imagination      and think about what's readily available, fits your budget      and would look good in your garden.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>A good edging keeps gravel out of the greens      and crabgrass away from the carrots.</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>My Own Choice</strong>    </p>    <p>      Maybe someday I'll be blessed with a large supply of free      flagstones or bricks along with a large crew of eager      friends to help me lay them in my garden. In the meantime,      though, I'll admit my fondness for "Bearwallow Beds," the      border system my husband, Franklin, and I devised when we      gardened atop nearby Bearwallow Mountain. (See the photo      that leads off this article.) Our main paths were sown in      fescue and white clover and bordered by 2 X 6 cedar boards.      Each 10-foot by 16-foot wooden rectangle housed two      four-foot-wide raised beds, with a one-foot-wide dirt path      between them (see the illustration).    </p>    <p>      The corners are a simple lap joint, mortised halfway      through so the boards lay flush. We drilled a ¾-inch      hole through each corner and hammered a 12-inch length of      ½-inch i.d. (inside diameter) metal conduit through      and into the ground until it was almost flush. The end of      the conduit that was still sticking up was flared outward      to hold the wood down. Then we hammered a 20-inch-long      piece of rebar down through the conduit and into the soil,      leaving six inches of the metal bar sticking aboveground.      We covered that dangerous-looking protrusion with bamboo,      PVC or a section of discarded hose and-presto      change-created a mild-mannered hose roller to allow      us to maneuver our watering hose around, but not over the      beds.    </p>    <p>      On some beds, we added additional 12-inch lengths of rebar      along the sides (spaced two to three feet apart). We could      set half hoops of PVC on these anytime we wanted to cover a      pair of beds with polyethyiene, Reemay or shade cloth.      Bearwallow Beds cost some money up front, but they last for      years, saving countless hours of hand edging. The boards      can be disassembled in the fall and stored indoors to      further lengthen their life or, if necessary, moved to a      new location altogether.    </p>    <p>      Yes, these simple, effective Bearwallow Beds seem to me to      be just about the best possible choice for a vegetable      garden border-that is, if I can't have my bricks and      my bricklayers, too.    </p>
