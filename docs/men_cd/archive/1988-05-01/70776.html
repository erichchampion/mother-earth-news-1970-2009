                    <p>      Cave life in the 20th century    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By David Petersen    </h5>        <p>      <strong>WILDERNESS SKILLS SCHOOLS, PART IV:</strong>    </p>    <p>      The day begins gently, cautiously, the way I like it.    </p>    <p>      I awake on my back on the dusty floor of a shallow      sandstone cave. Opening my eyes I see, high on the sloping      back wall, the faded, crumbling remains of a      pictograph-a small, crude painting made by some      primitive artist who took shelter here centuries before      Christopher Columbus was even so much as a gleam in his      father's eye. The figure is odd, angular, Anasazi.    </p>    <p>      <em>Anasazi</em> -those mysterious early dwellers of      the Four Corners region of the American Southwest. The name      is Navajo and means "the ancient ones," or "the ancient      enemy," and their ghosts pervade these hoodoo canyons yet.      It's the summer of 1987, but the atmosphere here is      Neolithic.    </p>    <p>      Photographer Branson Reynolds and I have come to this      wilderness of sandstone and sage in south-central Utah to      gather photos and experiences for a story on the Boulder      Outdoor Survival School, best known by its acronym, BOSS.    </p>    <p>      From southwestern Colorado we came, crossing into Utah and      over the Colorado River where it bleeds into Lake Powell      just above the Hite Marina. Then up and over and down and      through the rough-hewn splendor of the Burr Trail.    </p>    <p>      This 71 miles of dirt road between Bullfrog and Boulder,      Utah, snakes through such natural wonders as the      Waterpocket Fold and Capital Reef National Monument. Its      ruts and sand traps force one to drive slowly, and, driving      slowly, to see. It's exactly what a road through this rare      and beautiful moonscape should be. Unfortunately, the Burr      Trail is soon to be straightened and      paved-downgraded, as it were; converted to just      another Winnebago freeway.    </p>    <p>      But for now, at least, driving the Burr is still an      adventure: At a place called the Gulch, Branson and I were      stranded for a cold, wet, challenging night when a flash      flood beat us to the low-water bridge by only seconds.    </p>    <p>      The following morning, the floodwaters had receded      sufficiently to allow us to 4X4 across the swollen creek.      Then, while lugging up the far slope, the transmission in      Branson's Jeep began slipping, threatening to leave us      Gulched-up for a second time in less than 24 hours. This      struck us as funny; the joke being: Will we survive long      enough to reach survival school?    </p>    <p>      We persevered and, at tiny Boulder, rendezvoused with nine      fellow students and four instructors at BOOS’s      staging area just below the hilltop ruins of a 700-year-old      Anasazi pueblo. (Permanent headquarters are at Rex-burg,      Idaho.)    </p>        <p>      That first afternoon and evening with BOSS, we were      introduced to making fire with bow drills, learned      something of the revolutionary Halfpenny system for      identifying and interpreting animal tracks, and practiced      using handmade bows and arrows, spears and atlatls. Our      roof for the night was the star-spangled Utah sky.    </p>    <p>      Next morning, the 15 of us crammed into three pickup trucks      for the 30-minute ride to a trailhead in the upper canyon      of the Escalante River. A pleasant hike in, a few      waist-deep river crossings, and here we be.    </p>    <p>      The sun's sharp, bright edge pushes slowly across the sandy      flat below and up toward the open front of my little niche      in this vertical wall of sandstone. From somewhere nearby      comes the flutelike, descending-scale serenade of a canyon      wren. Perfect. Faint in the distance is the constant,      soothing rush of the Escalante River, swollen and muddy      from the recent rains.    </p>    <p>      I sit up in my bed-a single blanket, the powdery duff      of the cave floor for a mattress-and stretch to get      the blood pumping; it will have to do, for the nearest      coffee is more than 20 miles away. I stand and take      inventory of my surroundings: A sand-sage flat stretches      down to the river from the slickrock cliff face at the      bottom of which my rock condo, the smallest of four along      here, is situated. Up and down the riverbanks stand scruffy      rows of giant cotton-woods, their bark hanging gray and      baggy like the skin of very old men, their green leaves      shimmering in the timid morning breeze. Beyond the river,      rounded sandstone hills like off-white elephants rise to      form an undulating horizon. And, above all, the big      Southwestern sky.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Wilderness skills as they should be      taught-in the wilderness.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      I shake out my baggy fatigue trousers to dislodge any      scorpions or other sneaking invaders of the night, tug them      on and pick my way, barefoot, out from the chill shadow of      the cave and into the warm morning sun, placing my tender      twentieth-century feet carefully between angry clumps of      prickly pear cactus. I greet Branson, who chose to sleep      out among the sage last night, then I wander off alone.    </p>    <p>      Soon enough, things begin to happen. From the big cave up      the canyon a way, where most of the rest of the group spent      the night, come the sounds of morning activities... the      harsh squawking of someone working a bow drill, trying to      start a cooking fire the good old hard way... the sharp      <em>clack-clacking</em> of a toolmaker striking stone      against stone . . . laughter.<br />      I return to my sleeping niche for socks, boots and T-shirt,      then go to join the others. On an elevated ledge at the      back of the big cave sits head instructor David Wescott,      his legs crossed yogi-fashion, a pile of shaggy juniper      bark heaped to his front and a coil of hand-twisted rope      growing in his lap.    </p>    <p>      "Uncle Dave" is the school's director and, thus, the BOSS      boss. He stands to about six feet and wears medium-length      dark brown hair and a close-trimmed beard. His demeanor is      serious but easygoing; an unassuming and likable fellow.      Wescott has been at this rope-making task for only an hour      now and already has four feet of half-inch-diameter cordage      for his skilled efforts. This rope isn't as strong as the      much thinner cord another of the instructors showed us how      to braid from yucca fibers a couple of evenings ago, but      it's soft against the skin and more than stout enough to      serve its intended purpose as a tumpline for a wicker pack      basket.<br />      Down on the lower level of the big cave, the student who's      been sawing with the bow drill finally gets smoke, then      flame to kindle her morning fire. She hoots in      delight-this is her first success-and is      congratulated by her companions.    </p>    <p>      I settle down in a quiet corner of the cave to carve a      spoon from cottonwood bark. Yesterday, I'd used my hunting      knife to whittle a fine big spoon, more like a ladle, and      this morning I've determined to shape a second, smaller      utensil, this time using a scalpel-sharp sliver of      fractured river rock as a knife.    </p>    <p>      After a while we all wander out into the sunshine ... to      study animal tracks in the soft sand along the river's edge      (here a mule-deer doe grazed calmly in the night while her      fawn cavorted nearby) ... to check the Paiute and      figure-four deadfalls we set for rodents last evening ...      to gather willow and grass for basket weaving ... to knap      flint. . . to search for wild edible plants. The latter      task proves particularly rewarding.    </p>    <p>      With our instructors' help, we come up with a veritable      Anasazi salad: prickly pear fruit, salsify root, purslane,      squaw berries, holly berries, the chewable ends of      horsetail joint grass, seeds of four-winged saltbush,      unopened buds of evening primrose, cotton-wood cambium,      spectacle pods, leaves of young Russian thistle and the      inner flower petals of Indian paintbrush. We graze on these      goodies as we find them-a grassroots movable feast. A      couple of the more staunchly carnivorous among us even      snack on bugs. (Grasshopper, they report, has a pleasant,      nutty taste. The rest of us take their word for it.)    </p>    <p>      Later in the morning, we all work together to build a      two-person brush survival shelter, or "litter lodge," of      limbs, bark and leaves gathered from downed cottonwoods.      (Construction time, 19 minutes, and I would trust the      structure's efficacy in any weather.)    </p>    <p>      Afterwards, we trail down to the river for a spell of      "noodling." This ancient form of fishing involves wading      along the edges of a stream or lake and reaching up into      holes under roots and overhangs along the banks, or feeling      down into the quiet pockets behind submerged      rocks-probing gently for the scaly form of a resting      fish. If you locate one, you swiftly pin it to the bottom      with one hand, then grasp it by a gill with the other and      hoist it out.    </p>    <p>      In this murky floodwater, noodling is spooky business, and      none too productive. We come up with only one small fish,      which instructor David Holliday guts with a sliver of      chert, then skewers on a willow grill fashioned on the      spot. Thus mounted, the fish will slow-cook over the dying      embers of the morning's fire and serve as the main course      of Holliday's supper. (When we return to camp that evening,      Holliday-who has sworn to eat nothing on this trip      but what he can forage-discovers that the two camp      dogs have pilfered his piscatorial snack. It's sad to see a      grown man almost cry.)    </p>    <p>      At midday we hike up a side canyon to the nearest source of      drinking water-two small, quicksand-banked potholes.      This stuff is the color of good sour-mash whiskey.      ("Water's for drinkin'; Dickel's for sippin'.") Still,      we're told, it's safer than the Escalante River, which is      tainted by that bane to wilderness wayfarers, giardiasis.    </p>    <p>      As I kneel beside the nearest of the twin pools, I startle      a floating horsehair worm-a foot-long, pencil-thin      Nematomorpha. The horsehair's larvae are parasitic on      insects, not mammals. However...    </p>    <p>      When I splash the water with my hand, the sinuous little      creature writhes across the surface like an anorexic water      snake, then dives, disappearing into the gloom. I kneel to      drink, but, thinking of the worm and its invisible progeny,      hesitate.    </p>    <p>      "Just grit your teeth to strain out the big stuff, and      gulp," comes advice from behind me. It's Uncle Dave, who      laughs at this stock BOSS water joke, then swigs from the      container he's brought along for hauling water back to      camp. BOSS groups have been drinking from desert potholes      like these, and worse, for years, he assures me, and only a      very few students have ever gotten sick.    </p>        <p>      A very few. Well, it just takes <em>one</em> if that one is      me. But what the hell, I figure. I'm thirsty; I've been      thirsty for hours now, and, so far as I know, it's either      drink here or go dry I swallow my doubts, dip up a double      palmful and gulp deep of this lukewarm organic soup.    </p>    <p>      A student kneeling at the second pool sinks elbow-deep in      the shallow quicksand but manages to extricate himself      without help. I reflect that this isn't the sort of place      I'd want to come drinking alone. Unless I had to.    </p>    <p>      (Later, I confide to Wescott that I wouldn't mind hiking      farther, a lot farther, to find water with a little less      color and body. The following day, he obliges by leading me      and a handful of like-minded souls up the river about a      mile to a cool, clear spring.)    </p>    <p>      Come evening, we gather in the big cave and boil up a      nourishing stew. Delicious. While we're about it, we use      flour from our ration packs and water carried back from the      potholes to make up a batch of ashcakes for tomorrow's      breakfast. Aptly named, these ashcakes-baked as they      are atop flat stones placed in the ashes of an open fire.    </p>    <p>      After dark, we loaf around the twin fires in the big cave,      working on primitive crafts in the dim, flickering light,      discussing the day's events and what's yet to come. After a      while, I slip off into the darkness and hie to my hole in      the rock and my warm wool blanket.    </p>    <p>      So passes another day of cave life in the twentieth      century, BOSS style.    </p>    <p>      At the backcountry camp of another outdoor school I      attended this past summer, conversation turned to the      competition. When the talk came around to wilderness      <em>survival</em> as opposed to <em>skills</em> schools,      one of the instructors, a man who had attended a month-long      BOSS survival trek, commented, with what sounded like      serious admiration, that "those people at BOSS are so hard      they eat rocks." I doubt it, though I can't swear it isn't      so: BOSS groups do spend a <em>lot</em> of time      <em>breaking</em> rocks (ostensibly to shape primitive      stonecutting tools), and they do have one course advertised      as being for "hard-core rock-biters." But still. . .    </p>    <p>      Although BOSS offers classes of varying difficulty and      duration, the one that has earned them a reputation for      being the toughest of all civilian outdoor survival schools      is their 26-day Wilderness Expedition. According to David      Wescott, "This program is designed for the individual      seeking to test him- or herself physically, mentally and      emotionally. You'll hike hundreds of miles [the average is      200 to 250] and may lose 10 to 20 pounds in weight. The      mental and emotional challenges come in facing and      defeating obstacles and tasks set before you by nature and      your instructors, and in adjusting and learning to live      with nature in a harsh environment."    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>The stock BOSS water joke? "Grit your teeth to      strain out the big stuff."</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Sounds tough, and, according to the alumni and instructors      with whom I have spoken, it is tough-nearly a month      of intense foot travel across some of Utah's rugged and      beautiful canyonlands, carrying a minimum of food, water      and equipment.    </p>    <p>      The 26-day course is divided into five stages. The first      two or three days are called Impact, a rigorous time during      which you hike long and hard, enjoying little food, water      or rest. Welcome to the wilderness.    </p>    <p>      Stage two, Survival, begins upon reaching a predetermined      backcountry base camp and lasts for a full week. During      this time, you manufacture primitive tools and gear and      learn essential survival skills to carry you through the      remainder of the course.    </p>    <p>      Stage three, Group Expedition, involves a re-creation of      the primitive hunter-gatherer lifestyle. During this stage,      the main group (of perhaps 20) breaks up into several      smaller groups, each consisting of a handful of students      and one instructor. Each group then strikes out on a      different route, traveling several miles a day, fishing,      foraging and hunting and trapping rodents and other      non-game species as they go. At a prearranged time and      place, the groups rendezvous.    </p>    <p>      The fourth stage is the most trying for some students and      the most memorable for most. It's called Solo, and requires      you to spend three to five days entirely alone in the      wilderness.    </p>    <p>      The final stage is the Student Expedition, which is similar      to the Group Expedition in that it involves breaking into      small groups that travel different routes, each      accomplishing certain designated tasks en route before it's      time to rendezvous once again. But this time around, the      student groups are on their own, unaccompanied by      instructors.    </p>    <p>      For prospective students who can't afford the time or cost      of a month in the backcountry, or who simply don't feel the      need for such a heavy dose of physical hardship, BOSS      offers a 14-day condensed version of the longer course.    </p>    <p>      And then there's the torturous seven-day Advanced Primitive      Living and Nature Observation trek-the "rock-biter"      ordeal referred to earlier. The premise here is primitive      simplicity itself: no gear, no food, not even a penknife.      You walk into the wilderness with, quite literally, only      the clothes on your back and, for seven days, survive by      wits and gumption. Enrollment in this course is sensibly      restricted to those having previous survival training, and      class size is limited to 12 students (accompanied by two or      more instructors).    </p>    <p>      It was this rock-biter ordeal that Uncle Dave Wescott tried      to lure me into. "It'll be fun," he tempted. "It'll provide      lots of photo opportunities, lots of anecdotes for your      story." All too true, I suspected.    </p>    <p>      Branson and I talked it over one chilly night while camped      in a remote Utah side canyon. Tallying up our      qualifications to participate in such a rigorous ordeal, we      reminded each other of our considerable achievements in the      out-of-doors: There was our previous survival school      experience; our day-to-day he-men, macho lifestyles in the      mountains of Colorado; our middle-age vigor; our openness      to adventure; our fearless disdain of danger and      discomfort. We took all of this into consideration. . . and      told Wescott to look elsewhere for victims. Instead, we      opted for an Advanced Skills clinic.    </p>    <p>      In these seven-day skills clinics, referred to collectively      as SOS ("Sink or Swim"? BOSS isn't saying), the physical      challenge is minimized, with emphasis being placed instead      on developing primitive survival crafts and wilderness      skills in a relaxed and reasonably comfortable outdoor      setting. Rather than hiking across great expanses of      wilderness-starving, freezing, dehydrating,      suffering, <em>surviving</em> -the skills clinics are      stationary (though far from sedentary), conducted at      permanent base camps in Utah's Upper Escalante Canyon      (spring through fall) and Idaho's Snake River Valley      (winter).    </p>    <p>      Although modernism is gently discouraged, SOS students are      allowed to bring knives, backpacks, sleeping bags, water      filters and other contemporary gear (within reason), and      the rations are nutritious and filling, if not fancy.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the courses outlined above, BOSS also offers      12-day Adult Women's Outings, a 14-day Mexico Desert and      Marine Adventure, a seven-day Staff Training Class for      present or aspiring outdoor instructors, and a seven-day      Winter Skills Clinic.    </p>    <p>      While BOSS doesn't give its services away, the primitive,      low-technology nature of most of the courses helps keep      down overhead-and thus tuition-making BOSS a      bargain relative to most other outdoor schools. Here's a      sampling of 1988 course offerings and tuition rates:    </p>    <p>      • 26-day Outdoor Survival Trek-$895 (including      transportation from and return to Provo, Utah)<br />      • 14-day Outdoor Survival Trek-$590<br />      • 14-day Mexico Desert and Marine      Adventure-$875<br />      • 7-day Winter Living Skills Clinic      (Idaho)-$495<br />      • 7-day Basic and Advanced Skills      Clinics-$425<br />      • 7-day Advanced Primitive Living and Nature Awareness      ("rock biters")-$425.    </p>    <p>      College credit can be earned for most BOSS courses, and a      limited amount of tuition assistance is available to      students who can show financial need.<br />      What of the staff?    </p>    <p>      Larry Dean Olsen, the father of modern primitive survival      education and author of the bible of wilderness survival      lore, <em>Outdoor Survival Skills</em> (BYU Press, 1967),      has said of BOSS director David Wescott, "There are few      experts in the area of primitive skills, and Dave is one of      them." Wescott was an early star student of Olsen's, then      went on to develop and teach his own outdoor survival      courses at Brigham Young University and other institutions.    </p>            <p>      Today, Uncle Dave Wescott continues to seek out the      foremost experts in various primitive arts-such as      Dr. James Halfpenny, author of the innovative <em>A Field      Guide to Mammal Tracking in North America</em> (John-son      Books, 1986), and preeminent flint-knapper Errett      Callihan-to study their skills at first hand. More      important, Wescott spends an average of 200 days a year      living primitively in the out-of-doors. The experience      shows.    </p>    <p>      The instructors Wescott hires to assist him are also highly      qualified and varied in their outdoor experience. Like      David Holliday, an incredibly devoted and competent      authority on primitive crafts and wild edible plants and      their uses. When not roaming the Utah backcountry with      BOSS, Holliday conducts special programs in environmental      appreciation for the Tucson, Arizona, public school system.      And there's Mike Ryan, a quiet but likable fellow with      hawkish features, who passes his summers with BOSS in Utah,      and his winters as a hunting guide, horse packer and cowboy      in northern Montana.    </p>    <p>      Would I recommend Boulder Outdoor Survival School to my      friends? To my family? To you?    </p>    <p>      If you're looking for a pampered, catered, Yuppie-style      outdoor experience-no. If you're after      paramilitary-type "survivalist" training-no. If,      however, you wish to learn primitive crafts and      down-to-earth, low-impact outdoor survival skills, or if      you have an itch to test your strength and character (and      strength of character) in a most serious fashion, then      absolutely yes.    </p>    <p>      While BOSS isn't the only competent wilderness survival      school around, it's the oldest, it's the most challenging,      and it teaches wilderness skills as they should be      taught-in the wilderness.    </p>    <p>      For a 1988 course schedule and complete enrollment      information, send a 39 cents stamp to BOSS at P.O.
