                <p>      <strong>FROM A FORMER THIEF:</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Some "inside" tips on home security.<br /></em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">By Charles Young</h5>    <p>      Imagine yourself returning from a pleasant evening at the      movies. You pull into the driveway, happy, as always, to be      home, and walk in the front door. Switching on the light,      you stare in disbelief. No, this can't be right. The living      room is in disarray; the place is a shambles.    </p>    <p>      Your house has been burglarized. <em>A stranger</em> has      invaded your home, sorting through and taking your      possessions, and the odds are that the perpetrator won't be      caught. Nor is it likely that your property will be      recovered.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the chances of your home being broken into      increase every day. Middle-class suburban neighborhoods may      be among the most popular targets for burglars, but no home      is immune.    </p>    <p>      I know. As a former burglar, I did my work in all types of      neighborhoods across the U.S. One week I'd be in      California, the next in Arizona, and then in Florida. It      wasn't unusual for me to pull as many as 15 jobs a week,      then take the goods into another state and sell them before      they had a chance to hit the police "hot sheet," a      regularly updated list of stolen merchandise. For quite a      while I found burglary an easy way to make a living, simply      because the owners of the homes I hit failed to use common      sense. They probably didn't really think themselves immune.      Instead, I imagine most of them just didn't take the time      to consider their vulnerability. After reading this      article, I hope you'll invest the thought necessary to      safeguard your home. Believe me, the repayment, in terms of      both time and heartache spared, can be substantial.    </p>    <p>      <em>Charles Young, convicted after a crosscountry burglary      career spanning two years, will not be eligible for early      release until September 1993.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BURGLARS: A FIELD GUIDE</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are several common types of housebreakers that may,      at this moment, have your home under consideration. Let me      describe some of the more common varieties and a few of      their methods of operation.    </p>        <p>      <strong>TRANSIENT BURGLARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      This was my specialty. A thief of this type travels from      city to city for the purpose of his (or her) work. He      doesn't plan to stay in town for long, a week at most, so      he needs to come up with a list of potential targets      quickly. He'll probably begin with a map of the area, which      he'll narrow down by focusing on subdivisions . . .      particularly those with ritzy names and a golf course and      community pool.    </p>    <p>      Once he's selected a likely development, say a Bedford      Hills or a Bel Air, he'll visit the neighborhood, writing      down names and addresses from mailboxes. A phone book      provides the numbers for the targets. When the time is      right, he'll simply work through the list, seeing which      calls fail to bring an answer. (I've even gone so far as to      have an associate phone a house at a set time when I would      be at the window counting the rings, a sure-fire way to      ascertain that no one was home.) If your neighborhood is      hit more than once over a short period, the odds are a      transient burglar is working the area.    </p>        <p>      <strong>DAYTIME BURGLARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      These guys have to be pretty nervy. Not only does the      daylight housebreaker have to make sure the home is      unoccupied, he also has to avoid attracting the attention      of neighbors. To do this, he'll employ such ruses as posing      as a door-to-door salesman or driving a fake      department-store delivery truck. It's frightening, but      true, that he will probably know a good bit about you and      your habits before breaking in. He'll know how many people      are in the household, how many cars there are (and who      drives them), and when each person leaves and returns. When      he's ready, he'll make a quick call to be sure no one is      unexpectedly home, then park his vehicle nearby, or even      right in your driveway. He'll often gain entry through the      side or back of the house, placing the items he wants near      the front door, since that's the least suspicious exit.    </p>        <p>      <strong>NIGHTTIME BURGLARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      These housebreakers are very concerned about not being      seen. Unlike the daytime burglar, who depends on people      overlooking him, the cat relies on darkness and his ability      to avoid detection. He can often look at a house and      instantly judge if anyone is home, a skill honed while      scanning as many as 1,000 dwellings a week. Many times he      simply walks or drives through a neighborhood looking for      the "right" house. Then, after knocking on the door (and      perhaps looking in a few windows), he'll break in.    </p>        <p>      <strong>PETTY BURGLARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      These are the thieves who'll take anything, whether it can      be easily sold or not. If you find your TV or stereo gone      but your jewelry left behind, you've probably been hit by a      petty burglar, more often than not a kid from your own      neighborhood. Amateurs that they are, petty thieves often      break windows to gain entry.    </p>        <p>      <strong>"PRO" BURGLARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      At the top of his field, the pro can usually work day or      night, and can often bypass an elaborate security system.      Many times he'll actually be hired by jewelers or coin      dealers to steal valuables from their own clients. If      working for hire, he'll usually take only the specific      items he's after. If he's free-lancing, jewelry is his most      common target. He won't ransack a home, won't leave signs      of forced entry; frequently the victim won't even know he's      been robbed until he looks for the stolen item.    </p>
