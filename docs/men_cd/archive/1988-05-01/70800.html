                    <p>      <strong>EATH DIARY</strong>    </p>		<p>      <em>Will Congress come through?<br /></em>    </p>		<h5 id="byline"><em>By Tom Turner</em></h5>        <p>      Election years have a way of distracting politicians from      important legislative decisions, but Congress may      nevertheless come finally to grips with a number of issues      that have been argued over for several years. Two are at      the top of most environmental organizations' agendas.    </p>    <p>      One concerns the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.      This 19.3-million-acre reserve runs from the Arctic Ocean      on the north across the Brooks Range on the south, from the      Canadian border on the east to the oil fields of Prudhoe      Bay on the west. As it did in Prudhoe Bay, oil has made the      ANWR a national issue.    </p>    <p>      Development proponents have asked Congress to open the      refuge to oil drilling. They cite national      security-the vulnerability of the Persian Gulf, for      example-and the need to develop domestic energy      resources. Opponents, who hope to have the refuge legally      protected as wilderness, point to Interior Department      estimates that say there is but a 21% chance of discovering      economic quantities of oil and that even if oil is found it      isn't likely to add significantly to the nation's reserves.      They argue that the wildlife there, notably the 200,000      caribou of the Porcupine River herd, deserve statutory      protection and that even exploring for oil would pose      unacceptable threats. Competing bills have been introduced      in both the House and the Senate. Readers' views on the      matter will be welcomed by senators (Senate Office      Building, Washington, D.C. 20510) and members of Congress      (House Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515).    </p>    <p>      The other hot topic along the Potomac just now is clean      air. The Clean Air Act of 1972 was strengthened      considerably in 1977; now environmentalists want it      expanded to take on acid rain and toxic air pollutants      (which are ignored by existing laws) and to get tougher on      smog-producing ozone. Urban areas were supposed to have      solved their ozone problems by January 31, 1987, but none      have done so. Many, in fact, are farther from the goal than      ever. Again, your elected representatives will welcome your      views on any of these matters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oranges to the Rescue</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Not Man Apart</em> , the journal of the organization      Friends of the Earth, reports that American Telephone and      Telegraph has found some good news for the atmosphere in an      unlikely form: oranges.    </p>    <p>      A great and growing concern among atmospheric scientists is      the deterioration of the ozone shield, an invisible band of      gas that envelops the earth and filters cancer-causing rays      of the sun. The ozone layer has been thinning over the past      several decades, and recently a hole in the shield was      discovered over Antarctica.    </p>    <p>      The cause of the ozone deterioration is not simple      (environmental problems seldom are), but a major factor      contributing to it is chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals      that are used in spray cans, refrigerators, many kinds of      polystyrene foam and for various industrial applications.      CFCs were banned as spray propellants in the U.S. several      years ago, but they are still used for that purpose      overseas and in considerable quantities for other purposes      in the U.S.    </p>    <p>      The AT&T discovery is a solvent known as BIOACT EC-7      that is derived from oranges. It will be used in the      electronics industry, replacing a chlorofluorocarbon known      as CFC-113. BIOACT should cut the U.S. contribution to      ozone depletion by some 7%.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tragedy on Guam</strong>    </p>    <p>      Guam, in the South Pacific, is the site of one of the most      rapid and tragic wildlife catastrophes on record. Some time      within our past generation, a southeast Asian brown tree      snake (or perhaps a few) appeared on the island, probably      by accident and probably as a stowaway on a boat. The snake      soon multiplied, and its offspring have already extirpated      at least three species of birds found nowhere else in the      world. Brown tree snakes are currently threatening to wipe      out several more birds, as well as a unique species of      fruit bat.    </p>    <p>      Enter the U.S. Navy. It recently announced plans to build a      mammoth radar installation-rumored to be part of the      Reagan administration's "Star Wars" program-right in      the middle of an area deemed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife      Service to be essential to the survival and recovery of the      remaining endangered species.<br />      This move would worsen the problem.    </p>    <p>      Members of the Marianas Audubon Society have appealed to      the Navy to modify or cancel the project in order to      preserve the birds and the bats. If the Navy refuses, the      Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund is prepared to take the      matter to court.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Book of the Bimonth</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Stranger in the Forest</em> by Eric Hansen      (Houghton-Mifflin, 1988, $17.95, 264 pages) takes place in      the rain forests of Borneo, which are among the last large      untouched tracts of land on earth. In 1982, Hansen, a      six-foot-six-inch American, determined to cross 600 miles      of Borneo jungle on foot. His charming account of the trip      is by turns funny, moving and highly informative-and      it adds one more view of a world that is rapidly      disappearing in the face of outside forces lusting after      oil, timber and other resources. Most recent accounts of      the plight of the tropical rain forests concentrate on      nonhuman resources. This one introduces us to the humans      native to the jungle, and a delightful lot they are. Great      stuff.    </p>    <p>      <em>Tom Turner, a writer and editor who's worked in the      environmental field for 18 years, is staff writer for the      Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, an independent      environmental law firm that represents many organizations      across the country.
