        TOP, LEFT: Flavorful fish jerky starts with lean-fleshed swimmers such as crappie, bass, or pike. Fillet your catch... carefully cutting the meat from the bones. TOP, RIGHT: Next, scrape the meat away from the skin... using a simple back and forth movement. ABOVE, LEFT: slice the fillets thin and soak the pieces briefly in a marinade of water, seasonings and soy sauce. ABOVE, RIGHT: Dry the delectable delicacies on racks in an oven or dehydrator, or under the summer sun. A covering of cheesecloth or a similar material will help keep outdoor insects away.
