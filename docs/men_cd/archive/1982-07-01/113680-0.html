        <p class="caption">LEFT: After you've scrounged a wooden fruit crate for your live-fish box (these can usually be obtained from grocery stores or roadside markets), discard the container's bottom, brace its edges with scrap lumber, and attach chicken wire or hardware cloth to the carton's underside. Metal staples—hammered in—make secure fasteners. CENTER: Fit the crate with a lid by first nailing one-inch-thick scrap lumber over about half the container. RIGHT: The finished fish box... a floating ""home"" where finny critters will stay fresh and tender until it's time for the fry pan!</p>
