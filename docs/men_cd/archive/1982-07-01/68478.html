                <p>      This flavorful perennial, packed with Vitamin A, lends      itself to some remarkably good eating.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Faith B. Lasher and Daisy Smith    </h5>        <p>      Although rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum) is actually a      vegetable, it's generally used as a fruit. And, unlike most      such sweet edibles, this plant is-in many parts of      North America-kitchen-ready from late spring well      into high summer. (Furthermore, given the untimely frosts      that hit a lot of us in 1982, the outlook for a good      harvest-and thus low prices-for many other      pie-makings is gloomy indeed. Cold-hardy rhubarb, however,      is likely to be in good shape in your own plot and a      bargain on the grocers' shelves!)    </p>    <p>      If you're lucky enough to be able to walk out and gather      the tart stalks from a backyard patch (don't take any under      an inch wide and ten inches long), remember not to cut them      from the plant. Instead, grasp a stalk at its base and      pull, with a slight twisting motion, while gently pressing      down on any tiny new growth to prevent its being plucked up      along with the mature stem. Then, because rhubarb      <em>leaves</em> contain very poisonous oxalic acid, cut      them off . . . together with an inch of stalk.    </p>    <p>      Once you get your harvest to the kitchen, remember that      though all the traditional dishes given here call for      sugar, you can-if you prefer-simply substitute      equal amounts of honey up to one cup. When larger      quantities are called for, reduce the total amount of any      other liquids in the recipe by 1/4 cup per cup of honey      used. (We wouldn't, however, recommend the use of that      particular sugar substitute in the conserve recipe, as the      citrus juices called for are needed for flavoring and      shouldn't be reduced. You might want to try a date sugar,      though.) Also, lower the oven temperature 20° to      30° to prevent over-browning sensitive honey-sweetened      baked goods.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GRANDMOTHER'S RHUBARB PIE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Rhubarb-used either alone or in combination with such      other fruits as apples, strawberries, or      pineapple-makes so delicious a pie that it's known as      "pieplant".    </p>    <p>      To make the basic dessert, combine 4 cups of inch-long      rhubarb chunks, 1-1/2 cups of sugar, 1/3 cup of flour, a      dash of salt, and 1 tablespoon of butter . . . put the      mixture in a pastry-lined pan . . . and cover the filling      with a top crust (slash it in a couple of places to let the      steam escape). Bake the pie for about 45 minutes at 425      °F.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RHUBARB CONSERVE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Squeeze the juice from 3 oranges and 1 lemon, then grind up      the rind of one orange. Combine the liquid and peel with 10      cups of small rhubarb pieces, 8 cups of sugar, and 1-1/2      cups of seedless raisins. Cook the mixture slowly, stirring      often, until it thickens. Then add 1 cup of chopped nuts .      . . remove the pan from the heat . . . pour the conserve      into 6 hot, sterilized pint jars or glasses . . . and seal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OLD-TIME RHUBARB COBBLER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 450°F, then put 4 cups of finely      chopped rhubarb into the bottom of a greased casserole dish      and sprinkle 1 cup of sugar over it. Top the dessert with a      batter made from 1 cup of sour milk, 1/4 cup of butter, 2      eggs, 1/4 teaspoon of soda, 2 cups of flour, and 1/4      teaspoon of salt. Put the dish in the hot oven for 10      minutes . . . then reduce the heat to 350°F, bake the      cobbler another 30 minutes, and serve it warm, crowned with      a dollop of whipped cream.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RHUBARB CRISP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Add 2 tablespoons of flour, 3/4 cup of sugar, and 1 beaten      egg to 3 cups of cut rhubarb . . . and pour it all into a      greased baking dish. Now, combine 4 tablespoons of butter,      1/3 cup of brown sugar (packed), and 2/3 cup of flour. When      the mixture is crumbly, sprinkle it evenly over the      rhubarb. Bake the crisp at 350° for 40 minutes, or      until the rhubarb is tender.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RHUBARB SOUP</strong>    </p>    <p>      First, cook 4 cups of cut-up stalks with 4 cups of water      until the pieces are tender. Now, use a strainer or      electric blender to puree the stewed rhubarb. Add 1      tablespoon of cornstarch and 3/4 cup of sugar, and simmer      the sauce a few minutes . . . until it thickens a bit and      the sugar is dissolved. Cool the soup and serve it chilled,      with a dab of whipped cream on top.    </p>
