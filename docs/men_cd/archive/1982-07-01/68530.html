        <p>Here's a man who combines neighborhood beautification and garden improvement, using...</p><p>"I'll rake your yard, and you can pay me with the load of leaves I collect." That's what Erwin Joergens of Okawville, Illinois tells his neighbors . . . and he means it, too.</p><p>This retired auto mechanic and locally renowned gardener is able to <em>make</em> that generous offer because he can count on the help of his self-propelled wheelbarrow, a vehicle that enables him to motor up and down the street in order to collect leaves from nearby yards . . . and then to transport the autumn harvest to his large vegetable garden for use as mulch. In fact, Mr. Joergens' hauler is even equipped with a platform that allows him to ride along while he steers the "pickup".</p><p>Erwin's motorized mulch-mover (which, he says, took him only about 15 hours to build) incorporates a 3-1/4horsepower Clinton engine, an old rototiller gear case, and a T-shaped handgrip for steering .. . plus side levers that allow him to control the engine and gearbox via chains. And the wheelbarrow cost Mr. Joergens only $30 or so, because most of the parts were discards.</p><p>Since he's been using his new machine, Erwin has found not only that his garden is flourishing thanks to all that good mulch he's able to collect-but also that his relationship with folks in his community is better than ever. After all, who'd pass up an opportunity to have the lawn raked for free?</p>
