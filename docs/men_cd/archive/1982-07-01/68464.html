                <p>      Transform leather scraps into a mini-menagerie... for the      enjoyment of young and old alike!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Barry Vieh    </h5>        <p>      The little leather creatures I make for my daughter have      provided her with hours of playtime fun. I patterned my      creations after some similar animals-which I saw on      display in a gift shop-that had been handmade in      India and were thus pretty costly. However, anyone with a      few basic leatherwork materials and tools (all of which are      available at most craft stores) can easily duplicate my      efforts.    </p>    <p>      Before you begin, you'll need to gather together the      following items: a sharp knife (either a tool especially      made for use on leather, or an X-acto-type knife, or some      other heavy-duty cutting implement) . . . a sturdy,      large-eyed sewing needle <em>...</em> some waxed cotton or      linen thread . . . a rotary punch or an awl . . . leather      dye in a color of your choice, plus cotton cloth to spread      the dye . . . and, finally, the leather itself (five- to      seven-ounce hide holds its shape best).    </p>    <p>      When drawing a pattern, keep in mind that the end product      should be a stylized-rather than a      realistic-representation of the animal. Practice      cutting patterns out of paper and folding them until you      find a shape that works. To begin with, however, you may      want to try one or both of the animals pictured here.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STEP BY STEP</strong>    </p>    <p>      First, enlarge the pattern and cut it from the leather with      the knife. (A separate short strip is used for the tail.)      Now-using the awl or rotary punch-make the      holes indicated by dots on the pattern, both those that      will serve as eyes and those that allow access for the      needle when you're ready to do the stitching.    </p>    <p>      Then saturate the leather in warm water, and-while      it's still wet-spread on the dye with a soft cotton      cloth until the desired color is obtained. (Keep in mind      that leather looks darker when it's damp.)    </p>    <p>      The next step is to sew the tail onto the main piece, as      shown on the pattern. Once that's done, turn the edges      under as indicated, and press them to shape with your thumb      and index finger until they stay folded under by      themselves.    </p>    <p>      After that, it's time to stitch the holes to gether: A      matches up to A, B to B, and so on. If you're making the      giraffe, you'll first need to bring the neck <em>under</em>      the body and through the slit shown in the drawing before      matching up points A and points B. The ears and tail of the      critter should be curled upward.    </p>    <p>      Now, you're ready to shape the animal with your hands. Make      sure the leather is still wet . . . then bellow the body      out for roundness, and bend the ears and face into the      correct positions. To form the elephant's head, you'll have      to fold the leather back-on a line below the      ears-over the body, then bring the face down in      <em>front</em> of the ears. You may want the trunk to curl      up, too.    </p>    <p>      When you've finished primping and molding the animals to      your satisfaction, set them aside to dry overnight. Then,      in the morning-provided your creatures haven't roamed      off in search of a jungle during the dark      hours-you'll have some sturdy, whimsical additions to      your children's toy box . . . or (since there's no reason      youngsters should have all the fun) for grown-up display on      a shelf or desk.    </p>
