                <p>      <strong>The Seasons of the Garden</strong>    </p>    <p>      Midsummer's merciless sun scorches down from the cloudless      skies, and parched plants slowly lower their leaves as the      earth bakes beneath them. When dusk descends and the first      tentative fireflies flicker against the darkening horizon,      water the soil to slake its thirst . . . and resolve that      next year you'll make (and use!) much more moisture-holding      mulch.    </p>            <p>      The rootstocks commonly used to create dwarf apple trees      were developed, over a number of years, in England . . .      first at the East Malling Research Station and later at the      Merton Station (which explains why the prefixes M-or      EM -and MM are used to designate the different      varieties). These rootstocks can all reduce the tree size      (but not the fruit size!) of a variety that's grafted or      budded onto them . . . and they do so by simply limiting      the amount of food that the tree gets. This same factor      induces early bearing (often three or four years sooner      than that of full-sized trees) by reducing the amount of      vegetative growth. It seems that while there's leaf and      limb growing to be done, the apple tree postpones setting      fruit.    </p>    <p>      Depending on what rootstock you select and what apple      variety you're budding, the eventual height of the tree can      range from 6 to 25 feet. You should consider several      factors in choosing one of the five rootstocks generally      available: [1] the amount of land you can devote to apples      and the number of trees you hope to have, [2] the nature      and fertility of your soil, [3] the types of insects and      diseases present, and [4] the vigor of the apple variety      (or varieties) you want to grow. Here's a      listing-arranged in order of dwarfing effect, from      most to least-of a variety of popular rootstocks . .      . and some of their advantages and disadvantages.    </p>    <p>      <strong>M-27</strong> is really sort of a ringer: Although      it's been under development for several years, it isn't yet      available commercially. This superdwarfing rootstock      produces container-sized apple trees that stand a minuscule      4 feet tall. Work is now being done on propagating the      rootstock by tissue culture. When that's a reality,      supplies should increase rapidly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>M-9</strong> has the greatest dwarfing effect of      any widely available rootstock. Trees grafted or budded      onto it will usually grow to about 30% of their normal      size, which means that the M-9 dwarf trees are between 6      and 10 feet tall at maturity. Apples will usually begin to      bear in two or three years, and yield about 60 pounds of      fruit when they're fully grown. You can cram these dwarfs      pretty close, too . . . they're commonly grown on 10- or      12-foot centers. The rootstocks do have some drawbacks,      though. For one thing, they tend to have a weak root system      and to be somewhat brittle, so it's necessary to stake the      trees to keep them from blowing over and perhaps snapping      where they're grafted. (Many professionals bud these trees      high-about 12 inches from the rootstock's original      ground level-so they can be planted deeply for better      anchoring.)    </p>    <p>      Apples budded to M-9 are susceptible to attack by      nematodes, woolly aphids, and fireblight, so think twice      about choosing this rootstock if any of these nasties are      about. On the other hand, M-9 trees are resistant to collar      rot, which means that they'll usually do reasonably well in      wet or clayey soil. (Be sure to clear an area at least 2      feet in diameter when you plant one of these little fellers      . . . mulch to keep weeds and grass from stealing all the      food in the soil . . . and be prepared to irrigate M-9      trees during dry spells.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>M-26</strong> is second to M-9 in dwarfing      capacity. Trees on this rootstock usually grow about 40% of      the standard height, producing dwarfs that range from 8 to      12 feet tall. The M-26 root system is stronger than that of      M-9 (though staking is still necessary). The tree is      hardier, too, and growth is more vigorous . . . especially      in soils with poor fertility. M-26 is susceptible to collar      rot, though (so don't plant it in wet or clayey soil), and      fireblight and woolly aphids are also problems. It's best      to place buds high, and to set out these dwarfs on a 10' X      18' grid    </p>    <p>      <strong>M-7A</strong> (the letter "A" indicates that this      is a virusfree sibling of the original M-7) is a      semi-dwarfing rootstock . . . producing sturdy,      winter-hardy trees that are about 50% of standard size.      These productive, early-bearing, 12- to 15-foot beauties      should each produce over 100 pounds of fruit a year at      maturity. Apples on M7A do well in most soils, even in      clay. The rootstock is susceptible to suckering, but that      tendency can be defeated if you bud high and plant deep.      M-7A's aren't very drought-resistant and are susceptible to      woolly aphids. They should be planted on a 12' X 20' grid.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MM-106</strong> produces trees that are about 60%      of normal size (usually 12 to 18 feet tall). This      early-bearing, drought-tolerant rootstock is excellent for      the naturally smaller, slow-growing spur apple varieties.      M-106 trees are productive, root better than M-7A trees,      and do not sucker. They are vulnerable to collar rot,      though . . . so -once again-keep them away from      wet or clayey soils. And if you're cursed with early autumn      frosts, keep in mind that M-106 trees harden off late and      are thus susceptible to freeze damage. Space these      semidwarfs on a 14' X 22' grid.    </p>    <p>      <strong>M-111</strong> produces the largest apple trees of      our group of rootstocks: They attain about 70% of standard,      or 15 to 22 feet. The roots anchor well, are very      droughttolerant, and do not often sucker. M-111 resists      woolly aphids and collar rot, too, and is good in all types      of soil. Spur-type trees do especially well when grafted to      M-111, but-as is the case with all varieties grafted      to it-will fruit more slowly than they would on any      of the rootstocks above. Allow the big dwarfs an 18' X 24'      spacing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHOOSE WISELY</strong>    </p>    <p>      When you're selecting a rootstock/scion combination,      remember that the strongest varieties should be matched to      the most radically dwarfing rootstocks . . . and that the      better your soil is, the more you need to use a highly      dwarfing root. Among the stronger-growing apples are (in      order of decreasing vigor) Northern Spy, Mutsu, Summer      Rambo, nonspur McIntosh, Empire, Stayman, Red Delicious,      Red York, Greening, Winesap, Beacon, Cortland, and Lodi.      Weak growers (in order of decreasing strength) are Yellow      Delicious, Jonathan, Rome, Macoun, Ida Red, and the spur      varieties.    </p>    <p>      If you're planning to budgraft onto either an apple branch      or an already growing seedling or dwarfing rootstock, you      can do so right away. But if you're ordering one of the      Malling or Malling-Merton rootstocks now, you might have to      plant the youngsters in a nurse bed in the garden for a      year's growing. The dwarfers should, you see, be at      <em>least</em> a quarter-inch in diameter at the point of      the graft. If your delivered pieces are a bit too thin,      simply plant the rootstocks in a protected bed, spacing      them about a foot apart. Then, come next July, you'll have      a supply of vigorous candidates for bud grafting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THEY'RE ROOTING</strong> <strong>FOR YOU</strong>    </p>    <p>      Dwarfing and semidwarfing rootstocks are available from      several sources. Mellingers (Dept. TMEN, 2310 West South      Range, North Lima, Ohio 44452, catalog free) offers M-7 at      five for $7.15, MM-106 at five for $7.75, and M-26 at five      for $9.75. Lee-Land Nursery (Dept. TMEN, Box 223, North      Kingsville, Ohio 44068, catalog free) has M-9 and M-26 for      $1.75 each, while M-7A, MM-106, and MM-111 sell for $1.50      each. Lee-Land also has interstem dwarfing rootstocks,      which unite the strong dwarfing qualities of M-9 with the      sturdy root systems of MM-111 or MM-106. These cost $4.00      each. Southmeadow Fruit Gardens (Dept. TMEN, Lakeside,      Michigan 49116, price and variety list free, encyclopedic      catalog of fruit varieties $8.00 . . . and worth it as a      permanent reference) offers the following in packages of      ten at $15 per package: M-2, M7, M-9, M-26, MM-104, MM106,      and MM-111. Both Mellingers and Lee-Land can supply you      with grafting equipment, including knives and rubber      budding bands.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Orchard ists interested in grafting an      antique apple scion onto a dwarfing rootstock might want to      read the article on page 130 of MOTHER NO. 63. And we think      you'll find the treeplanting center spread in issue 65 to      be a valuable guide. See page 104 to order back      issues.<br />      <br />      Have a Bud    </p>    <p>      The summer months-from mid-July through      August-are the best times to expand your apple      orchard, using a technique known as bud grafting (or      budding). You'll need a rootstock (see the preceding      guide), or an apple branch of about pencil thickness, on      which to make the bud graft . . . and scions, or budsticks      (that is, young branches of the desired variety, cut from      this year's growth and kept constantly moist until used).      You'll also need a razor-sharp blade (an X-acto-brand knife      works well) and a supply of commercially produced rubber      budding bands or budding tape.    </p>    <p>      This particular grafting technique involves inserting a      vegetative bud cut from the apple variety you want to      propagate into a T-shaped flap that's been scored in the      rootstock or branch. The cambium layers of the bud and the      rootstock will grow together, and the apple variety can      begin life on a new understructure.    </p>    <p>      Here's how to do it: First, select a vigorously growing      branch of the apple type you'd like to produce. (If you      want an unusual variety, don't despair . . . you can order      any of 79 different scions sold by the Worcester County      Horticultural Society for only $1.25 each. For a list of      those available, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to      Mrs. Mason, WCHS, Dept. TMEN, 30 Elm Street, Worcester,      Massachusetts 01608.) Cut the branch and remove the leaves      from this budstick, leaving about a quarter-inch of each      leaf stem attached to the stick (they'll make useful      handles). Next, make a T-shaped cut into the bark (but not      into the wood) of the rootstock or branch you'll be      grafting onto. If you're working with rootstock, make the      cut at a point 8 to 12 inches above ground level, so you'll      be able to transplant the grafted tree deep while still      keeping the bud graft 2 inches above the soil (that will      prevent the grafted variety from rooting, which would      short-circuit the rootstock's dwarfing action). The      crossbar of the T-cut should be about 1/2 inch and the      descender about 1 inch long.    </p>    <p>      Now, carefully peel back the bark that's been loosened by      the T-shaped cut, turn to the budstick, and select a large,      healthy bud (they're in the leaf axils) from the center of      the stick. Using your knife, slice off the bud and a      surrounding 3/i4-inch shield of bark. Trim the top of the      bud shield flat, grasp it by the leaf stem, and insert it      into the cut in the rootstock or branch. Make sure that the      trimmed top of the shield butts firmly against the crossbar      of the "T". Then fold the two bark flaps over the shield,      and wrap the graft-above and below the bud-with      budding tape or a rubber budding band, to protect the union      from moving or drying out.    </p>    <p>      If you're lucky, the bud should "take" within two or three      weeks, at which time the tape or band can be removed.      You'll know that you've succeeded if the stem portion      sloughs off while the bud remains fat and healthy. However,      should both stem and bud become puckered and sullen, you'll      have to try again. (It's imperative, though, to keep the      budstick cool and moist between attempts in case you do      need to make another graft.)    </p>    <p>      Don't expect any growth from a new graft during its first      year . . . usually the bud remains dormant until the      following spring. When growth does commence, trim back the      rootstock to 3 or 4 inches above the graft. Later in the      season, when there's been significant growth from the      grafted bud, you can trim the rootstock close to its new      leader.    </p>    <p>      There are two solid advantages to "making" your own apple      trees, using this technique. First, it's inexpensive: You      can graft dwarfed trees for under $4.00 each, even if you      buy both rootstock and scionwood . . . and that's a 50%      saving over the price of most commercial trees. Second, you      can custom-tailor the fruitbearer to your particular needs      . . . that is, you can select the proper rootstock for your      soil conditions and the vigor of the variety you're      growing, and you can determine the approximate height of      the finished tree. You could even make your own 5-in-1      variety, bearing a quintet of antique apples!    </p>    <p>     <strong>Gleanings</strong>    </p>    <p>      If the material about budding in this issue's column has      you raring to go, you're probably a good candidate for      membership in the North American Fruit Explorers (NAFEX), a      group of amateurs (in the best sense of the word) devoted      to exchanging information about growing fruits. You can get      membership information from the treasurer: Ray K. Walker,      Dept. TMEN, Box 711, St. Louis, Missouri 63188. Send a      self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request, please      .... Sterling Publishing continues to issue the superb      Blandford horticultural books from Britain. The latest is      Mervyn Kessell's Rhododendrons and Azaleas (available in      many bookstores for $17.50), with plenty of hints on      cultivation, propagation, and pruning. There are over 60      color photos, too .... Garden Way has published a revised      edition of an old friend, Dick Raymond's Down-to-Earth      Vegetable Gardening Know-How (also found at many      bookstores, for $7.95). The book is stuffed with good      advice, pictures, and tips from readers . . . and the chart      on green manures (pages 82 and 83) alone is worth the price      of admission.    </p>
