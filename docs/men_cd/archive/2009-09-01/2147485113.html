        <p>Fall is here (in the Northern Hemisphere, that is), and as our thoughts turn to the coming colder weather, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has launched a new website and educational campaign to help people be more energy efficient and save on their energy costs this winter.</p><p>Titled “Stay Warm, Save Money,” the campaign focuses on providing simple, cost-effective, energy-saving solutions for individuals and small businesses. The <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/seasonal/" target="_blank">Stay Warm, Save Money website</a> lists no-cost and low-cost energy-savings tips, financial assistance links, long-term solutions for saving energy, and a blog that covers energy-saving topics. You can also find information on performing an energy audit to find out where your home is losing energy - and money!</p><p></p><hr /><h5>Reprinted from <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm" target="_blank">EERE Network News</a>, a free newsletter from the U.S. Department of Energy.</h5>
