                    <h5 id="byline">      by Lorraine Worley    </h5>    <p>      Here's a delicious answer to the question...    </p>        <p>      For a good many years I regretted-but thought      unavoidable-the waste that occurred when I'd have to      cut open (and thus expose to spoilage) a huge pumpkin or      winter squash in order to make a few pies. The dilemma was      solved recently, though, when I came across a recipe for      "pumpkin butter" ... a treat that's both delicious and easy      to store.    </p>    <p>      To make 15 to 17 quarts of the versatile spread, you'll      need 40 pounds of pumpkin or squash (cooked and pureed),      2-1/2 to 3 quarts of honey, 6 tablespoons of cinnamon, 4      teaspoons of nutmeg, and 4 teaspoons of ground cloves.    </p>    <p>      Make sure the fruit is free of dirt, then cut it in half      and scoop out the seeds and the stringy insides. If the      pumpkin or squash you're using has a tough skin, the      easiest way to cook it is to simply bake the two sections      in the oven at 325째F until they're very soft . . . and      then remove the "meat" from the shells with a big spoon.    </p>    <p>      However, if you're going to use a food mill-rather      than a blender-to process the pulp (and,      surprisingly, I've found the hand-operated strainer to be      the more time-efficient device), you may want to cut      soft-skinned varieties in 2" chunks and bake the pieces.      (If you don't have access to an oven, just put the cubes      into your canner-along with an inch or two of      water-and steam them until they're done. My ninequart      canner will hold about 40 pounds if it's packed full. So      I'd estimate that one of the more common seven-quart      canners can be used to hold about 30 pounds of      butter-to-be.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>THICK AND LUSCIOUS</strong>    </p>    <p>      When your pumpkin or squash is fully cooked, puree it      (using either a blender or a food mill, as you prefer), put      the yellow-orange liquid into your canner or a big kettle      (until the container is about half full), and start it      cooking. Pumpkin butter, you'll find, can be prepared in      only an hour or two . . . a fraction of the time required      to process apple butter. When the spread starts to thicken,      add the honey and spices (which will turn the mixture a      golden brown) and taste-test to see whether it pleases your      palate. Now let the sauce simmer-stirring it every so      often to prevent sticking-and when it's thick enough      to support an upright wooden spoon, you're ready to can!    </p>    <p>      After sterilizing the jars for ten minutes and the lids for      five, pack the hot mixture to within one inch of the top of      the containers, seal them, and process the butter for ten      minutes in a boiling water bath.    </p>    <p>      Once your canning's done, you may well wonder just what      you're going to do with 15 to 17 quarts of pumpkin butter!      Well, fear not .. . the delicious spread is incredibly      versatile. Here are a few of my own favorite recipes ...      just to get you started.    </p>    <p>      <strong>YEASTED PUMPKIN BREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Dissolve 1 teaspoon of yeast in 1/4 cup of warm water and      let it stand while you combine 1/4 cup of molasses, 1/4 cup      of honey, and 1/2 cup of melted butter. Next stir in 1-1/2      cups of pumpkin butter, 1/3 cup of water or milk, 1 cup of      whole wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/2      teaspoon of ground cloves. Now add the y east and let the      mixture rise in a warm place for 1 or 2 hours . . . after      which you can work in 2 more cups of whole wheat flour and      1 cup of chopped hazelnuts or walnuts. Finally, spoon the      dough into a greased loaf pan ... let it rise until it      almost doubles in size . .. then bake it at 350째F for 1      hour.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PUMPKIN BUTTER PIE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Combine 1-3/4 cups of pumpkin butter, 1/8 to 1/4 cup of      honey or molasses, 1 cup of milk, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon of      cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves. Then pour the      mixture into an unbaked whole wheat pie crust, and put it      in a 350째F oven until the custard sets (about 65      minutes).    </p>    <p>      <strong>BANANA-PUMPKIN MILKSHAKE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Process 2 cups of pumpkin butter, 1 cup of walnuts, and 2      cups of milk (you might try substituting whipping cream for      part of the milk) in a blender until the nuts are totally      shredded. Add 2 bananas (they're best frozen) and 2 more      cups of milk, and blend the drink thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PUMPKIN BUTTER CAKE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Beat two egg whites until they're stiff. Next, cream 1/2      cup of melted butter and 1 cup of honey together . . . and      stir in 1 cup of pumpkin butter, 2 egg yolks, and 1-1/2      cups of whole wheat flour. Add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, 1      teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 cup (or more) of chopped      walnuts, and 1 cup of raisins. Fold in the egg whites, and      bake the treat for 1 hour at 350째F in a greased and      floured 8" or 9" cakepan.    </p>
