                    <p>      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville,      N.C. 28791    </p>    <p>      If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or less) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"-you      started your venture. Because If your story can be fitted      into an upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES,      you'll receive [1] the warm satisfaction of knowing that      you helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy and      [2] a free two-year new or renewal subscription to THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).    </p>    <p>      When I read "How to Make and Install Your Own Insulation      ... for 5 cents or Less a Square Foot", on page 120 of      MOTHER N0. 48, I immediately began to use the article's      information as a basis for experiments of my own. The story      explained how to make cellulose insulation by grinding up      newspapers with a hammermill . . . an Idea that I was sure      could be turned Into a moneymaking venture!    </p>    <p>      So I purchased a used 100-HP hammermill (for $1,700) and      Invested another $1,800 in a used truck . . . $200 in a      six-cylinder junkyard engine and transmission . . . $400 in      miscellaneous mounting parts and materials ... and $565 in      scrap paper, chemicals, and insulation bags. Then I mounted      the hammermill and the engine on the bed of the truck,      backed the vehicle up to my garage, and blew the building      about four feet deep in cellulose insulation.    </p>    <p>      After I tested the material to be sure that it met      government requirements, I filled a number of sacks with      the padding and transported them-for sale-to      building sites and stores. The bags sold quickly at $3.00      each, and I soon found it necessary to raise the rate to      $3.50 apiece for those that I delivered (an amount that      brought my expenses for paper, chemicals, sacks, gasoline,      and oil down to approximately 20% of my asking price).    </p>    <p>      Initially, I worked at my new enterprise on Saturdays only,      but within three months I was putting in 60 hours a      week-filling 120 bags in that time-and even      that wasn't enough to keep up with orders. Consequently, I      built a sackfilling machine, using a 12-inch-diameter      auger... and upped my bagging production to 100 every 12      hours. At this speed-once I've earned back my initial      investment-I calculate that I'll be capable of      realizing a $20-per-hour profit!    </p>    <p>      Gary L. Weaver<br />      Murfreesboro, Tenn.    </p>        <p>      Not long ago I enthusiastically plunged into a new hobby,      hoping to chase away the winter doldrums . . . and my      sideline has expanded Into a booming bootstrap business!    </p>    <p>      It all started when MOTHER NO. 55 arrived in the mail . . .      which was just about the time that northern breezes began      howling !n earnest around these parts. Well-though      I'm an avid amateur photographer during nine months of the      year-when frostbite weather sets !n for a spell, you      can generally find me (and my camera) idly holed-up by the      blaze of a potbellied woodburner ... and I'm usually      racking my mind for a way to put that leisure time to good      use! So, when I came across the article "Photosketch for      Profit" (on page 72), I figured I'd found the ideal pastime      for a frost-fearing shutterbug like me.    </p>    <p>      The initial "capital" needed to begin my enterprise was      practically nil, since I already had most of the essential      equipment (including a darkroom!) in the basement. In fact,      my sole expenses were for a two-ounce bottle of tincture of      iodine ($2.06), six pens (a mere 6 cents each), and a      penholder (89 cents . . . adding up to a grand total of      $3.31! Thus supplied, I set to work transforming      black-and-white photographs into attractive Ink drawings.    </p>    <p>      At first, I merrily pursued my new craft with out any      intention of making a profit (or even of selling the      sketches at all), but-when I discovered that there      was an eager market for my artwork-I decided to make      the hobby pay its way. My first customers were local      merchants, who asked for a number of drawings on      consignment. And the best part of the "sales" was that      instead of paying cash-the storekeepers agreed to      display sample drawings In their shops in exchange for the      gift of a sketch. Now, thanks to that method of nearly free      advertising, I have more orders than I can keep up with!    </p>    <p>      I sell most of the sketches for prices ranging from $15 to      $30, while a contracted piece brings a minimum of $25. And      a good portion of the fee goes in my pocket, because the      actual cost per drawing is only about $4.00 or $5.00. The      time spent on each piece can be anywhere from 30 minutes to      as much as eight hours, depending on the complexity of the      drawing.    </p>    <p>      Best of all ... I work my own hours, and I couldn't be      happier! During the balmy days of spring, sumnier, and fall      I snap photos to my heart's content . . . and then turn      those shots Into profitable sketches during the cold winter      months. In fact, the only drawback to my home business is      that my wife wants to keep all the pictures to decorate our      house!    </p>    <p>      Terry Dean<br />      Bowling Green, Mo.    </p>    <p>      I was introduced to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> with Issue 20 . .      . at a time when I was just beginning to realize that there      was more to life than a 9-to-5 job. MOTHER gave me a great      deal of encouragement during my "evolving" months, and by      the time issue 31 arrived, I'd Invested most of my working      capital !n some acreage in southern Illinois. My long-term      plan was to start an experimental eco-community whose      members would strive to tread lightly on the planet . . .      but before I could begin working toward such a large-scale      objective, I needed to establish myself In a home-based      enterprise that would support me when my few remaining      funds ran out.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER NO. 28 provided me with my first business idea . . .      in the form of an article entitled "Wildcrafting for Fun      and Profit" (page 32). My woodlands were full of wild      pokeweed that would bring a good price if I could just find      a way to pack up the foraged fare and send it off to the      Chicago Wholesale Vegetable Market. So I rummaged the local      retail marts for discarded crates in which to ship my      20-bushel loads . . . and when the pokeweed season came to      an e nd five weeks later-I'd earned a grand total      $575!    </p>    <p>      Summer was then in full swing, and my second season's      moneymaker was waiting to turn a profit: I'd planted a      garden that was productive enough to fulfill my own needs      and provide me with a salable surplus as well.      Consequently, I hauled my harvest to the local farmers'      markets In my pickup . . . or, on some occasions, I simply      pulled the truck to the side of the road to vend my produce      out of the back of the vehicle. During the growing season I      sold my homegrown edibles one or two days per week, and      made an average profit of $50 every time I went to market.    </p>    <p>      When my warm-weather ventures had supported me through two      seasons, I decided It was time to organize a year-round      source of Income . . . and I settled on a business that was      based on MOTHER's story "A Home Where the Beefalo Roam"      (issue 57, page 82). I've taken only the first few steps      toward the establishment of that enterprise . . . beginning      with the conversion of some of my woodlands Into pasture, a      task that has left me with timber both for fenceposts      (which sell for $1.00 each) and for firewood (priced at $80      a cord).    </p>    <p>      I'm now on the road to <em>Individual self-reli</em>      <em>ance</em> , and-as a result-I can finally      begin to direct some energy toward my original goal: If any      MOTHER-type folks are interested in joining me, there's an      eco-community that's waiting to be built!    </p>    <p>      Wilbur Loyet<br />      Box 55, Rt. 1<br />      Olmsted, III. 62970    </p>    <p>      Christmas is a time when everybody needs some extra cash,      and I'm no exception. But December took me by surprise, a      few years back, and the month was half over before I even      realized it had begun. Needless to say, I was in a panic      ... until I came across a moneymaking idea in THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted) Handbook of Home Business Ideas and Plans.      The article "How to Start Your Own Natural Candy Factory"      held the answer to my prayers: a business that required no      Initial cash outlay, and only a minimum amount of time, to      establish.    </p>    <p>      I decided I should select one seasonal treat that I could      master and sell as my specialty, and peanut brittle became      my choice. The candy-I reasoned-was popular,      deceptively easy to make, and high-priced on the commercial      market.    </p>    <p>      My starting point was a basic peanut brittle recipe, which      I experimented with and revised until I'd perfected the      formula. (Fortunately, I had the necessary utensils-a      candy thermometer, a scale, and so on-as well as some      peanuts and other ingredients already in my pantry.) I      simply wrapped the finished product in waxed paper,      packaged it in brown paper lunch bags, and went out      selling.    </p>    <p>      To my delight, the brittle was an immediate hit: The sales      were clinched by my offer to let each potential customer      sample the treat ... and I returned home with orders      totaling 50 pounds! It took me only a week to make and      deliver that first batch of candy-plus 15 more pounds      that had been requested in the meantime-all in my      spare evenings. And-at $2.00 per pound-the      product brought in a tidy $130 (with only $30 of that      amount required to replace the ingredients I'd used from my      kitchen).    </p>    <p>      All during that holiday season, the orders for peanut      brittle kept pouring !n . . . but I was able to take things      "slow and easy" from then on, because my first week's      profits had already guaranteed me the rare luxury of a      worry-free Christmas!    </p>    <p>      Carla Williams<br />      Brookville, Ohio    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Bootstrap businessfolk will be glad to know      that, in this Issue, MOTHER introduces another column      that's sure to be of interest to entrepreneurs.
