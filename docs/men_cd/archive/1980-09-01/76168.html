                        <p>      As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back <em>in</em> <em>the autumn of      1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over again.    </p>    <p>      And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.    </p>    <p>      Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N. C. 28791. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we all <em>can read      what the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>    <p>      We've been country-living-for the past six      years-in arid New Mexico and have learned a lot about      surviving on the bare minimum. Now, we're ready to move to      a beautiful old Indiana homestead, but we're troubled since      the farm's soil appears worn out (and most likely has been      treated with nitrates and pesticides). We have fantasies of      bringing it back to life with green manure and organic      matter. Will it be possible for us to get a chemical-free      crop within a couple of years? (There's enough cleared land      for us to grow our own hay and grain for animals . . . to      plant a produce field for our consumption and the sale of      vegetables . . . and possibly even to put in a cornfield      for making alcohol fuel!)    </p>    <p>      Our first farm, in Vermont, was completely depleted and      leached out when we bought it . . . the soil wouldn't even      grow good <em>radishes.</em> We brought the earth back to      fine tilth by putting in cover crops (rye, buckwheat,      clover) and turning them under . . . by adding compost . .      . and by cultivating repeatedly. We were able to harvest      fine peas, beans, carrots, lettuce, etc. within two years.    </p>    <p>      Now we're tackling some heavy clay soil in a new garden in      back of our latest stone house. Using the above techniques,      we hope to again have a productive plot within two years.    </p>    <p>      In MOTHER NO. 62, you said you use French-intensive      gardening in "certain sections" of your vegetable patch.      Can you tell me why you use the method in some plots and      don't in others?    </p>    <p>      Also, since you are vegetarians and raise no livestock, do      <em>you</em> grow soybeans for protein? I'd like to know,      too, how many acres you've found it necessary to plant for      food self-sufficiency.    </p>    <p>      We find it convenient to make long conventional rows for      corn, beans, peas, broccoli, cucumbers, cauliflower, and      squash. Our smaller crops-such as carrots, onions,      radishes; lettuce, beets, etc.-are grown in raised      beds, three feet across and of varying lengths.    </p>    <p>      We've not been able to bring soybeans to full ripeness in      our climate, since they need a longer growing season.      However, we buy them dry and <em>do</em> get some of our      protein from the legumes.    </p>    <p>      Our garden has-for the last 25 years-been 100'      X 100' (roughly a quarter acre). It produces sufficient      vegetables to supply most of the food required by five or      six people. We're now starting out on a new, 50' X 50'      garden. And we believe that, using intensively planted      raised beds, we'll be able to grow enough food for two or      three people on this small plot.    </p>    <p>      I've found that being a male has certain advantages when it      comes to living the good life. I'm quite capable, for      example, of hauling and cutting wood for my yearly needs,      plus performing many other homestead chores that require      "male muscle". All of the local women are very dependent on      their masculine counterparts for such things. My question      is: What would you do if Scott were unable to cut the      firewood and so forth? I realize I've no real information      that leads me to assume that <em>he does</em> do this      chore, but most of the women I know would-in such a      situation-have to purchase wood or go back to relying      on oil, gas, or electric heat.    </p>    <p>      Scott <em>does</em> saw, chop, and split all the wood      burned in our kitchen and living room stoves. He also keeps      the woodboxes full (and makes most fires). What do I think      a lone woman would do if such an essential service were not      tended to by someone else? Why, she'd do it      <em>herself,</em> of course. And it <em>would</em> be a big      job . . . but it would be one that could (and would      <em>have</em> to) be done.    </p>    <p>      Homestead living for a single person, whether man      <em>or</em> woman, is a 24-hour occupation and should not      be undertaken lightly. Several single people we know are      attempting to clear their own land, build their own houses,      and make their own gardens. Frankly, we think it's too much      for one person (male <em>or</em> female) to take on alone.    </p>    <p>      Could you give me a good source from which I could purchase      pure Vermont maple syrup?    </p>    <p>      Since we left Vermont 27 years ago (where we hung over      4,000 buckets and made over 1,000 gallons of maple syrup      during our last "sappin' " spring), we've had to buy the      sweet liquid, as there's not a single maple tree on our      wind-swept Maine coast. In our day syrup was sold at a      little over $3.00 a gallon. Now that we have to      <em>buy</em> it, though, the price is between $14 and $20 a      gallon.    </p>    <p>      We <em>have</em> found Richard Garrett (Wellington, Maine      04990) to be a good source for the real thing. His syrup is      homemade, over wood fires on his own place, and he can send      you either the finest Fancy quality, or Number One, or the      blackstrap Number Two, which runs late in the season.    </p>    <p>      You folks are a great inspiration to me, but I have a      question that I can't find the answer to in your      publications.    </p>    <p>      How would you buy acreage in today's market without going      into debt? Land here in Oregon is increasing in price      faster than the inflation rate, and-if it just stayed      even-inflation would still make it seem all but      impossible to save enough money to pay cash for a piece of      property. What advice do you have for young people, without      substantial assets, who want to "live the good life"?    </p>    <p>      Your question is a real stumper. We're lucky enough to have      been born in a previous generation . . . when we had little      cash, but when the dollar <em>was</em> worth 100 cents,      instead of the 10 cents, 9 cents, or 8 cents dollar which      now passes for money. We admit it's difficult for young      people to gather the funds to pay today's outrageously high      real estate prices . . . or even to find a suitable      location that isn't already occupied by "summer folk".    </p>    <p>      Try to locate other like-minded people, who have a little      money ahead, and who will go into the enterprise with you.      Don't go deep into debt for land. Drive up old dirt roads      and find abandoned farmland. Look for acreage selling for      back taxes.    </p>    <p>      You also might take on farm jobs and learn what you can      <em>before</em> buying and settling down. In the meantime,      hunt about and inquire as to what's on the market in the      area you've chosen. When you find the place, you can hasten      the possibility of self-sufficient living with economy and      good management.    </p>    <p>      We encountered plenty of difficulties in the 1930's. You      will find others, not necessarily similar, in the 1980's.      We wish you good luck, patience, and perseverance in your      search for the good life.    </p>
