                    <p>      <strong>by David Lampe</strong>    </p>        <p>      Some wonderful animals could become extinct if steps aren't      taken to...    </p>    <p>      If the animals shown in the accompanying photos were whales      or dolphins, pandas or white tigers, or even blind albino      fish the length of your little finger . . . they might be      protected by law. But the pictured beasts are all examples      of domestic species that have been nudged out of farmyards      by "improved"-which often translates as more      fashionable-breeds . . . to the extent that they've      become endangered. In fact, many of our tame animals face      extinction simply because such creatures have to please the      fickle fancies of humans to survive.    </p>    <p>      Most farmers find they can't afford to go on raising      unpopular-and thus unprofitable-animals, and      zoos won't accept tame species unless the creatures look      exotic. Animal preservation societies ignore our endangered      livestock strains because such beasts aren't wild (although      few would be very tractable pets). So there are no      heart-tugging documentaries ... no boycotts of governments      that approve the slaughter of such livestock ... nor even      "Save the Tamelife!" bumper stickers to bring the cause of      vanishing domestic breeds to public attention.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN IRREPLACEABLE GENE BANK</strong>    </p>    <p>      You may be surprised to know that some farm animals have      actually passed from popularity to extinction in as little      as six years! In this century, for example, more than 20      separate British livestock breeds have ceased to exist . .      . while six species of pigs were allowed to die out in just      20 years.    </p>    <p>      Nor is the problem confined to England alone. Since World      War II, Denmark has-in the name of      progress-systematically killed off all its "obsolete"      livestock, and France was in the process of doing so, too .      . . till some concerned Britons explained the possible      consequences of such acts. Now the French are actually      seeking out endangered tamelife to preserve, as are the      Dutch and Austrians. But many other major agricultural      nations-including our own-are doing nothing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ONE MAN TO THE RESCUE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, a few people are aware of the problem. Joe      Henson, for example, is an English farmer who-with a      partner-grows rye and barley on 2,000 windswept acres      of Oxford University land in the Cotswold Hills. About ten      years ago, Joe found out that his country's Zoological      Society planned to slaughter the ancient livestock kept at      Whipsnade Zoo . . . to feed the institution's lions      and-at the same time-provide more space for      wild animals.    </p>    <p>      Henson-who had for years been fascinated by old      domestic breeds offered to shelter any Whipsnade sheep and      cat tle that the Royal Agricultural Society or Reading      University (Britain's premier agricultural college) hadn't      room for.    </p>    <p>      Since he knew it would be expensive to keep the animals,      Joe created a "farm park", where visitors could pay to      picnic and to peer at historic British livestock. This      enterprise enabled him to gradually gather in more remnants      of old breeds. In fact, today he maintains 8 rare species      of cattle, 12 of sheep, 2 of goats, 4 of pigs, 4 of horses,      and 15 of poultry . . . all in all, the largest such      collection-public or private-in his country.      And Henson, more than any other one person, urged into      existence the Rare Breeds Survival Trust: a unique,      non-profit organization dedicated to finding and preserving      unwanted, endangered domestic breeds.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SEAWEED-EATING SHEEP</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Trust's first major project was the saving of the      Orkney sheep, which is the world's only ovine breed that is      able to thrive on seaweed. Introduced to Scotland by the      Vikings-and common throughout the Highlands until      Bonnie Prince Charlie's defeat-the animals no longer      exist on the island whose name they bear. Almost all the      survivors were found on St. Kilda Island, where they were      isolated from commercial flocks by a stone wall that kept      them on the beaches. But that wall was rumored to be      crumbling, and the shepherds were said to be thinking about      slaughtering the Orkneys to keep their other flocks pure.    </p>    <p>      Joe Henson visited St. Kilda and found the wall intact, but      he thought the rare sheep were no less endangered for all      their well-enclosed security. "If something like      hoof-and-mouth disease had swept the island," he explains,      "all of its animals would have had to be put down ... and      the seaweed eaters would have become extinct."    </p>    <p>      So Joe moved some of the sheep to his farm, where they      learned to eat grass. The first lambs, however, had longer      bones than those of their sires and dams, and Henson      realized that new grazing conditions would radically alter      the beasts' shape over the years. So the Rare Breeds      Survival Trust spent all its initial funding-some      10,000 pounds-to buy an en tire island in the St.      Kilda group and move some of the Orkney sheep onto it.    </p>    <p>      Now that the breed is established not only there, but on      the Cotswold farm <em>and</em> on St. Kilda itself, it      should survive . . . and careful crossbreeding among the      three colonies can probably keep the species' bloodlines      strong. At Henson's farm, some Orkneys are also being      crossed with a related variety, the Flemish Landrace, to      supplement the Orkney gene pool.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STRANGE, BIG, AND BEAUTIFUL</strong>    </p>    <p>      St. Kilda Island once had its own "native" sheep breed,      which was probably another Viking introduction. None      survives on the island, but the animals are still found      elsewhere. Black and multihorned, they are strange enough      in appearance to attract the attention of zookeepers.      Still, only 250 of the animals existed when Henson      assembled a flock at his park.    </p>    <p>      Some beasts of the Soay species-Europe's oldest-known      sheep, which has remained unchanged since Neolithic      times-also survive only on other islands in the St.      Kilda group. Lambs of the breed are, at birth, almost      certainly the world's largest in proportion to their      mother's body weights, and the species may someday be in      demand again. Henson and other Trust members made a point      of assembling several flocks.    </p>    <p>      The prettiest sheep in Britain-without a      doubt-are the Jacobs, said to be the breed in the      Book of Genesis that provided the fleece for Joseph's "coat      of many colors". The British animals descend either from      sheep that swam ashore from the Spanish Armada or from      animals that arrived in the dowries of Continental brides      of English farming gentry centuries ago. After World War      II, the British Wool Marketing Board (a state monopoly) no      longer bought mottled fleece, making the Jacobs suddenly an      endangered breed. Fortunately, the Trust discovered that      several city park departments-as well as a number of      private estates-are keeping Jacobs flocks to use as      "living lawn mowers".    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER ENDANGERED LIVESTOCK</strong>    </p>    <p>      Warwickshire Longhorn cattle-which are almost twins      in appearance to the beasts Neolithic artists painted on      cave walls in France-were, like Jacobs sheep,      believed to be endangered. But the Survival Trust was able      to find several breeders who still raise the Longhorns      (which, incidentally, are among the ancestors of our      "traditional" Texas breed). Although they're considered too      rangy by most modern butcher shops, the "obsolete" cattle      do have an exceptionally high growth rate and will be      wanted-at least as bloodstock-if and when      British housewives again demand leaner beef.    </p>    <p>      Some rare breeds, the Trust discovered, had been neglected      too long: Only one Norfolk Horn ram remained in all the      British Isles, and no ewes. The Norfolk Horns are therefore      considered extinct ... at least in Britain. All that have      been found are some Norfolk-Suffolk and some Norfolk-Manx      Loughtan crosses.    </p>    <p>      In order to prevent another such tragedy, Henson is already      assembling a flock of Southdown sheep . . . a native      English breed rapidly dwindling in its homeland, but still      popular all over the rest of the world. In fact, the      Survival Trust is continually looking abroad for examples      of this and other rare British breeds. Tamworth and      Berkshire pigs, for instance, were so few in number in      Britain that they were becoming hopelessly inbred . . .      until the Trust was able to bring home fresh lines from      Australia.    </p>    <p>      "Recently, we got a letter from a woman in Kenya," Henson      recalls, "whose grandfather, years ago, had taken a flock      of old Scottish Dumpy chickens down there. The family had      kept the flock going, and now it had about 100 hens. She      wanted to know if we were interested in having some. Were      we! Only ten of the birds still existed in Britain, and she      had 100!"    </p>    <p>      Saving endangered poultry, he says, has always been a      problem ... "unless you have something with feathers      growing out of its head and a tail about eight feet long,      which will be of interest to zoos". The average British      bird fancier doesn't favor old utility fowl-like the      Light Sussex, the Utility Rhode Island Red, or the North      Holland Blue-which tend to eat more than do newer      varieties. Therefore, such species are often endangered in      Britain, though some are still numerous abroad . . . and      the Trust, of course, wants to im <em>port</em> enough      birds to keep the rare breeds going.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HELP FROM HOMESTEADERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Interestingly enough, Joe has found that British communal      farmers are also helping to preserve many types of      endangered livestock.    </p>    <p>      "A good number of the 'back to the land' people get in      touch with us," Joe explains. "Often, ten families or so      will get together, buy one of the more ramshackle stately      homes, and produce their own food on about 20 acres. Such      individuals are finding that a lot of the traditional      livestock survive without as much cosseting as      the'improved' breeds require.    </p>    <p>      "These men and women are the kind of people-and there      are many of them in your country too, I believe-who      are attracted to such beasts as the Dexter cow ... the      traditional Irish house cow. Half the size of, say, the      Friesian, it produces half as much milk-or half as      much meat-on less <em>than halt</em> as much food."      [EDITOR'S NOTE: For more <em>information on</em> these      <em>mini-cows,</em> see "The <em>Amazing</em> Irish      Dexters" <em>on</em> page 71 of <em>MOTHER NO</em> . 62 . .      . which is available for $3.00 plus $1.00 <em>shipping and      handling</em> from <em>THE MOTHER EARTH</em> NEWS(restricted),      P.O. Box 70, <em>Henderson</em> ville, North Carolina      28791.]    </p>    <p>      Because of the work of the Survival Trust, a lot of rare      old breeds are being scientifically evaluated for the first      time. Recently; for example, a white Chartley Park      bull-a member of a breed that dates back to Britain's      Roman occupation-was picked at random from a herd and      put on test at the British National Agricultural Center.    </p>    <p>      "It was done largely as a joke," Henson admits. "The animal      was being compared with bulls that had been selected for      growth rate for generations, the best animals that had been      bred that year . . . in short, the nation's top beef bulls.    </p>    <p>      "Amazingly enough, the Chartley calf matched all the      competition for weight gain per day. And not only that,      but-when his excess back fat was X-rayed-the      testers found that the beast had less fat than any other      bull in the test . . . which means that he'd probably      produce more lean meat than any of the others. So now the      Agricultural Center is testing Longhorns, Gloucesters, and      all the other rare breeds.    </p>    <p>      "As a matter of fact, a Longhorn just beat all the modern      breeds for live-weight gain per day . . . and, at the end      of the test, the 'outdated' bull-unlike the more modern      animalshad not yet attained his full growth!"    </p>    <p>      <strong>YOU CAN GET INVOLVED</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Rare Breeds Survival Trust keeps a priority list of      breeds the organization hopes to save. What matters, Joe      says, isn't just the number of survivors, but rather the      number of bloodlines ... the number of viable males . . .      and the animals' geographical distribution.    </p>    <p>      "You might find only 300 of a breed left," he explains,      "but if they're scattered all over the country-and if      there are enough bloodlines-the breed can be      considered secure.    </p>    <p>      "On the other hand, there are 3,000 North Ronaldsay sheep,      yet the breed is considered rare because the beasts are      almost all on one island." Henson has recently installed a      small flock of the animals at his farm park.    </p>    <p>      There are a dozen similar parks in Britain now . . . some      on farms and some on the grounds of stately homes. Six of      these, including Henson's, are approved Trust "Survival      Centers". The Trust also keeps lists of members who are      willing to raise herds or flocks on their land, but not to      open their acreage for public show . . . and the      organization has friends and members all over the      world-people like you-who keep an eye out for      rare livestock.    </p>    <p>      So if you know the location of any groups of "antique" farm      animals-or if you want to join the Trust to encourage      tamelife preservation-write to The Secretary, The      Rare Breed Survival Trust Ltd., Dept. TMEN, c/o The Ark,      Winkleigh, Devon EX 19 8SQ, England ... and please enclose      $1.00 to cover expenses when you request information.    </p>
