        [1] This is the view of Mt. Hood as seen from the back of our cabin. [2] At first we worried about our son's adjustment to wilderness living, but here's happy Jacob playing ""junior road builder"". [3] The deck is down and the walls are going up... and this is just the first day of work on our future home.

[5] For hot showers, we made a temporary setup consisting of an old electric water heater tank in a plastic cover... and it worked!
