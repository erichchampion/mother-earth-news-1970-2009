        Dill Bouquet, which is shorter (and sturdier) than most varieties of the popular cooking, salad, and pickling herb, responds well to winter planting... Lovage, a hardy perennial that produces abundant leaves and stalks that taste similar to celery, is both attractive and useful... Wintertime freezes will help break the dormancy of flat-leaved parsley's seeds and the lively flavored little green will produce an early crop come the following spring... French sorrel (it's related to our commonly foraged sheep sorrel ""weed"") is a tart-tasting early leafing perennial... Hyssop adds a minty flavor to meals and can also be used to form a decorative two-foot-high hedge.... Curly-leaved parsley is another herb that takes well to cold weather sowing.
