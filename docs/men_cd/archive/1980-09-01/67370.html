                <p>      MOTHER's livestock expert provides all the basic know-how      necessary to raise a very valuable-and      popular-homestead animal.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Randy Kidd    </h5>        <p>      You can produce all the milk you'll ever need-for      pennies a gallon-by raising goats. And that homegrown      drink will be fresh, delicious, and exceptionally      healthful. In fact, many folks (including some babies) who      are allergic to cow's milk can readily digest goat      "nectar".    </p>    <p>      (And by the way, the myth that goat's milk has a      disagreeable "off" flavor is simply untrue. If you keep      your equipment clean and quickly chill your nanny's daily      offerings-as you'd have to do to keep <em>any</em>      dairy product tasty-you'll find that goat's milk is      every bit as good as, if not better than, "moo juice".)    </p>    <p>      There are many other advantages to rearing your own goats,      too: Each doe will, every year, produce two or three      youngsters that can be used as replacement stock, butchered      for their tasty meat (called chevon), or sold to other goat      farmers. The animals are excellent browsers that can forage      for much of their own feed. The beautiful hide from      butchered bucks and does can be made into vests and rugs.      Some goats (the mohair varieties) grow luxurious coats of      usable wool each year. The livestock can become great      companions as well as helpful cart pulleys. Goat's milk can      be used to make yogurt and-with a bit of      know-how and practice-delicious butter and      cheese. And finally, every caprine critter you raise will      contribute valuable manure for your vegetable garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RECOGNIZE YOUR MARKET</strong>    </p>    <p>      Goats are often called "poor man's cows", because they're      the most practi cal homestead milkmakers imaginable. A good      dairy cow, it's true, can produce as much as five gallons      of bovine beverage per day . . . more than most households      can use, <em>and</em> she'll eat a heck of a lot of grain      and hay. A goat will average a usable yield of a gallon (or      less) of milk daily, during its annual 305-day lactation      period . . . and will consume a lot less feed while doing      so.    </p>    <p>      Of course, even a <em>gallon</em> of the liquid nutrient is      a lot for many families to consume each and every day, so      you may be tempted to think of turning your goat-raising      hobby into a small home business. If so, it's best that you      forget the idea. As I've explained in previous articles in      this magazine, you should consider your own <em>household      to</em> be the market for almost all your homestead      livestock products. This, "rule" is especially true when      applied too goats . . . because the laws regulating milk      sales in most states make setting up a small caprine dairy      almost impossible. <em>(You can,</em> of course, check your      local county or state health department to find out about      the requirements for milk sales in your area.)    </p>    <p>      There are, however, many ways to use your excess milk      supply. You can make yogurt or cheese, and feed other      livestock with it (chickens and pigs love goat's milk).      It's also possible to use goat cream to make butter, but      let me forewarn you that this process is somewhat difficult      because a nanny's milk has such <em>tiny</em> fat droplets      that, in effect, it's already homogenized. Most folks find      they need a manual or electric cream separator (the units      are available through goat supply houses) to collect usable      quantities of cream.    </p>    <p>      A doe yields more than milk, of course . . . each year      she'll birth from one to three kids. The youngsters      <em>can</em> present the beginning goatkeeper with a      problem because-since they're about the cutest and      most lovable animals on this earth-you may get so      attached to the furry little newcomers that you'll end up      surrounded by <em>hordes of</em> full-grown nannies and      billies.    </p>    <p>      To avoid that problem, you must be prepared to sell or      butcher some of your home-raised goats. Actually, any      <em>female</em> offspring are relatively easy to deal with.      One of your best doelings can be saved to replace its momma      on the milk line when the old gal reaches five or six years      of age . . . and you'll generally find a good market for      your other young does.    </p>    <p>      Buck kids, however, are another matter. In order to ensure      that the best possible male genes go into the makeup of      your future herds, you should save only one out of every      <em>hundred</em> b illies to be a breeding sire. The many      males that <em>don't</em> meet such a rigid standard of      excellence should be castrated when they're less than three      weeks of age and, ultimately, butchered. Since there's      nothing tastier than chevon (its flavor resembles that of      lamb), most folks don't mind at all that about half of      their nanny's kids will be bucks.    </p>    <p>      The meat can be harvested shortly after the males are born      (prepare it much as you would rabbit) or when the      youngsters are weaned at 8 to 12 weeks of age. Then again,      you might want to keep the animals until they reach their      mature weight of 60 pounds . . . at around six months.      (Don't wait any longer, though . . . a goat doesn't grow      much after it reaches maturity.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>KNOW WHAT A NORMAL</strong> <strong>ANIMAL LOOKS      AND FEELS LIKE</strong>    </p>    <p>      When you decide to purchase a herdstarting doe (or two),      you'll immediately be faced with the decision of what breed      to invest in. In the U.S., the five most popular purebred      goats are Toggenburg, French Alpine, Saanen, La Mancha, and      Nubian. (The last two varieties could be called the "Jersey      cows" of goats: Although they give slightly less milk than      do their three "cousins", their product is high in      butterfat.) Any of the five breeds can be successfully      raised in all parts of North America, but in most cases the      best breed for you will be the one that is most common in      your area . . . since their offspring will be the easiest      to sell to other folks.    </p>    <p>      Grade (crossbred) goats will often yield just as much milk      as-or even more than-their purebred sisters do,      and will usually cost less to buy. But the offspring from      such animals will almost never sell at as high a price as      do purebred kids. Therefore, it's probably better to buy a      higher-priced purebred doe at the outset, and then pay      yourself back for that purchase later . . . through the      sale of the kids.    </p>    <p>      Another decision you'll have to make is how <em>old</em> a      goat to buy. (You can judge the age of any horned ruminant      by examining its teeth: A young goat, for example, has a      set of small baby teeth. These are replaced by larger,      adult teeth-at the rate of one pair a year-over      a four-year period.) Kids will be the least expensive      purchases, but they'll also be the riskiest buys, since      only a professional goat breeder can judge whether or not a      spindly-legged youngster will eventually mature into a      high-quality milker.    </p>    <p>      Older nannies are not always the most practical purchases,      either. . . because udder production usually (but      <em>not</em> always) tapers off after an animal is four or      five years old. The best way to be sure of what you're      getting, then, is to purchase a productive two- or      three-year-old doe, even though such premium creatures are,      naturally enough, the most expensive.    </p>    <p>      Regardless of what breed-and what age-your      herd-starter is, you should be absolutely sure you're      buying a <em>normal</em> goat. If you've read my other      livestock articles in MOTHER, you already know that a      healthy critter should be bright-eyed and alert, walk with      an easy-going gait, and have no abscess-indicating lumps on      its body (check especially along the beast's neck, legs,      and udder). And the animal's droppings should be firm      (rather than runny).    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUY THE BEST</strong> <strong>GOAT YOU CAN      FIND</strong>    </p>    <p>      Your first doe will, of course, have a determining      influence on the future herd, so-in addition to      buying a <em>healthy goat</em> - you should take home      only the <em>best</em> specimen you can locate. Now you may      at first find that all goats look pretty much alike to you,      but with a little practice and experience (which can be      most easily obtained by watching from the stands of a local      goat show or county fair), you'll be able to discern the      difference between a topnotch pail filler and an inferior      bottom-of-the-bucket milker.    </p>    <p>      For openers, a smart buyer <em>doesn't</em> mea sure the      quality of a goat by the amount of meat a doe will make, so      don't look for a thick, chunky critter that resembles a      prime steer, pig, or lamb. Instead, buy an animal with      "dairy character" .. . a lean, angular ruminant that's      blessed with plenty of body and udder capacity. A good      place to start inspecting your prospective milker is right      at the animal's midsection. Size up the beast's belly: The      rounder and deeper it is, the better. Next, examine her      chest. If you can lay the flat of your hand between the      doe's front legs, and if two fingers will fit between each      pair of ribs, the goat's heart and lungs have a good amount      of working space.    </p>    <p>      Now, eyeball your doe from the rear. The top of her back      area, from the hips to the shoulders, should resemble a      long triangle. The critter should also be wide at the hip      bones and look broad-bellied enough to "store a barrel full      of feed". Her back limbs should be placed well apart, and      the udder should fill the open space between those legs.      The body of the milk sack should also extend well back      toward the animal's tail, the back face of the udder should      appear to be flat, and its teats should point straight down      (rather than out or in).    </p>    <p>      If all of the foregoing features look good, mosey around to      the side of your prospective purchase and examine the      animal's udder from this new angle. The sack should extend      well forward and fill up most of the flank area. The      "floor" of the udder should, again, appear flat and should      also lie below, or level with, the animal's hocks.      And-when seen from this lateral viewpoint-the      teats should seem to be aimed slightly forward. These      "handles" should also have a size and shape that will just      fit into the palms of your hands.    </p>    <p>      Finally, don't actually <em>buy</em> the goat-no      matter how fine the critter looks-until you've tried      milking her! Some spoiled does are so cantankerous that      they're almost impossible to work with . . . and in a few      others the tubes in the teats (the passages that the milk      squirts through) are so tiny that you'll tucker out your      fingers before you ever milk the nannies dry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CULL THE WORST ANIMALS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The other side of goat purchasing and raising-and one      that every owner must sooner or later face up to-is      culling the herd's least productive animals. Unless you      want to keep an ever-increasing stock of caprine pets, you      should-each year-select the stingiest milkers,      poorest mothers, and least valuable kids (even if one of      them is your favorite animal companion) and add them to a      neighbor's herd or your own dinner table.    </p>    <p>      The gleaning process will hold especially true for male      goats because, as I said before, you should keep only one      out of every 100 young bucks. And how did I pick that      particular number? Well, if you assume that an average buck      can breed 20 does a year for five years and if each of      those mothers bears two kids per litter, one buck can      father 200 offspring, and 100 of those offspring will be      males. It follows that only one-the very best      one-of those young bucks will be needed to replace      his aging sire.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUILD YOUR GOAT H</strong> <strong>OUSE AND FENCING      WELL</strong>    </p>    <p>      When it comes to goat shelter, most caprine caretakers      adhere to the rule of K.I.S.S. "Keep It Simple, Stupid!"      The animals do <em>not</em> need elaborate homes, so any      three-sided shed that'll keep out the wind, rain, or sun      will be adequate. Allow 16 square feet of inside space per      adult goat, and face the structure south to avoid the      prevailing winter winds (while letting in some of that cold      season's sunlight). In addition, plan your shelter's      construction so the shed will be easy to clean.    </p>    <p>      Building <em>fencing for</em> goats, however, is      <em>not</em> a simple undertaking at all ... because the      animals are incredibly skillful escape artists. A      nimble-footed nanny can jump a four-foot-high obstacle,      squiggle through a tiny hole, shove a fencepost with her      head until the pole collapses, and even knock against the      top of a fence wire with her front hoofs until she mashes      the barrier down and can leap out.    </p>    <p>      So unless you're hoping to get even with a neighbor whose      stray cow just punctured your prize pumpkin, enclose your      goat yard as sturdily as possible. One good approach is to      use welded wire-with no more than six inches between      stays-and mount the material on the <em>in</em> side      of firmly placed posts. Be sure the finished fence is at      least 4-1/2 or 5 feet high, and add a hoof-resistant top,      built out of boards, to the enclosure.    </p>    <p>      If you're willing to spend $18 to $22 a section, you'll      find that commercially available 4-1/2' X 16' fence      panels-made out of quarter-inch galvanized      steel-are pretty nearly goatproof. Or you might      construct a three-stranded electric barrier (with the wires      placed 10, 20, and 40 inches above the ground) to contain      your critters. Either of these preventive measures should      effectively keep most of your caprine livestock at home.      Bucks, though, are notorious fence-jumpers ... especially      during breeding season. You'll often need to run an      electric or barbed wire strand above, and ten inches      <em>inside, a</em> five-foot fence to keep the randy      animals from roaming.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FEED THE CRITTERS CORRECTLY</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the most important advantages of goat      raising-for the economy-minded farmsteader-is      that the milkmakers will function perfectly well on      inexpensive hay or foraged food ... with a little grain      thrown in to step up their milk or breeding output.    </p>    <p>      Actually, idle bucks and nonpregnant dry does can be kept      in tiptop shape on goodquality hay or some other forage      crop alone . . . because the ruminants' internal bacteria      can use that food source to produce all the protein,      carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins the goats need. Even      though bucks and does do love their greens, however, they      are not naturally grass-grazers. (So don't buy a billy to      replace your lawn mower . . . the picky chewer will strip      your fruit trees-or a favorite rose bush-before      it starts cutting the grass!)    </p>    <p>      The grain you feed to your goats should be supplied only to      meet the extra protein needs of milk- or kid-producing      animals. A pregnant doe, for instance, will do best if      given a one-pound scoop of grain daily ... and two pounds a      day during the last three weeks of pregnancy. During the      breeding season, a buck can also be given one to two pounds      of grain a day. (Both animals should, of course, also have      access to plenty of good-quality hay or pasture.)    </p>    <p>      The amount of extra protein a <em>milking</em> doe needs      will depend upon how much of the liquid she gives each day      and on the butterfat content of that milk. (A county      extension agent or area dairy farmer can show you how to      determine butterfat levels.) In general, you should feed      the dam one-half pound of grain daily for each pound of 3%      butterfat milk she produces. If the butterfat content is      5.5%, though, you should give the doe three-quarters of a      pound of grain a day per pound of milk. (If you're      caretaking an excellent producer that yields as much as 12      pounds of milk daily ... count your blessings and give that      remarkable nanny all the grain she wants.)    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that any goat's daily dinner won't be      complete unless you've added a few "garnishes" ... namely,      a free choice supply of both table salt and a good mineral      mix (provide both substances in a feed bunk that's      protected from the weather). And one more thing: Please      <em>NEVER</em> forget to keep clean, fresh water available      to your animals at all times.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UNDERSTAND YOUR GOATS' CYCLES</strong>    </p>    <p>      A good understanding of your caprine critters' growth and      breeding patterns will help keep you prepared for all their      annual natural events. You should know, for instance, that      goats can begin their reproductive lives at an early age.      Doelings are mature enough for mating when they're only six      months old (or reach a weight of 60 pounds), which means      that they normally can-and should-be bred      during their first fall. And bucks may reach fertile      maturity by the time they're just three months old.    </p>    <p>      A female goat commences her yearly heat cycles when the      hours of daylight begin to decrease significantly (in most      states, this will occur around August or September). The      doe will be in estrus for one to three days at a time, and      have an 18-to 21-day "rest" between heats. This pattern      will continue (only if the animal's not bred, of course)      through March.    </p>    <p>      Nearly every female goat will let you know when she's in      heat by acting more than normally affectionate toward you,      bleating and crying frequently, continually wagging her      tail, and (perhaps) urinating often. You may also notice      some swelling around the animal's vulva and/or a small      amount of clear or bloody vaginal discharge. (Now and then      you will run across a shy gal that's secretive about her      heat periods, but don't worry ... any <em>buck</em> in the      area will know exactly what's going on.)    </p>    <p>      After a successful mating, the doe will be pregnant for 150      days before she gives birth (or, as most dairy folk say,      "freshens"). The milk flow of a lactating mother will be      strongest during the first two or three months after      delivery, gradually taper off, and finally end around 305      days after it begins.    </p>    <p>      A doe can be rebred for the next year's kid crop while      she's still producing milk from last season's. However, the      animal should definitely be given a two-month vacation      between the end of one milking period and the start of the      next. You can calculate when to begin this dry spell by      counting backward 60 days from the expected birthday of the      next batch of kids .. . or forward 90 days from the      anniversary of the doe's fall breeding. On the determined      day, simply stop milking the female and put her on a      low-calcium, milk-fever-preventing diet. (See the sidebar,      "Preventing Ketosis and Milk Fever in the Pregnant Doe",      which accompanies this article.)    </p>    <p>      The best way to "dry up" a goat is to let the pressure of a      full udder stop further production. So don't-because      you feel sorry for a large-uddered critter-milk the      sack out every so often . . . you'd just be prolonging the      doe's agony.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KEEP ACCURATE AND MEANINGFUL RECORDS</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you've been reading closely so far, you'll understand      how important it is for a goat owner to keep track of      birthdays, breeding dates, heat cycles, and dry periods. In      addition to such bits of record keeping, you should also      list the kinds of medication you use on your      milkers-and the dates you administer the      remedies- <em>and maintain</em> a daily record of      your doe's milk yield throughout her lactation period.      (This last statistic can give you a good idea of what each      doe's offspring should be worth to a prospective buyer.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>CODDLE THE YOUNGSTERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The best way to ensure that each of your goats will have a      long and productive life is to make sure every newborn      starts off on the right hoof. So you should prepare for      "kiddings" by gathering up clean rags, filling a wide-mouth      plastic bottle with tincture of iodine, and making sure      you've plenty of clean bedding on hand.    </p>    <p>      Newborn goat care consists of paying attention to Dr.      Kidd's Three C's: Cleanliness, Cord Care, and Colostrum.      Cleanliness is vital . . . the kid nursery should be well      ventilated (a three-sided, south-facing shed should do      fine) and have a deep bed of absolutely dry and clean      bedding for the young'uns to curl up in. As long as you      maintain such a nest, you will almost never have to provide      any supplemental warmth for the hardy tots . . . in fact,      you should probably avoid doing so. Enclosed, heated sheds      are almost always too damp (if you can feel moisture on the      nursery wall, increase the structure's ventilation or      remove some of its inhabitants) and are ideal breeding      grounds for all sorts of disease-carrying organisms.    </p>    <p>      When the youngsters are born, give each one a vigorous and      stimulating rubdown with a clean rag until the animal is      dry (the nanny can also accomplish this task with her      tongue). Then soak each youngster's navel in iodine by      dipping its cord stub into your tincture-filled bottle,      pressing the container firmly against the kid's belly, and      then turning both goat and bottle upside down.    </p>    <p>      Each babe will also need an early dose of colostrum ...      that special antibody, nutrient, and vitamin loaded milk      that mothers produce for a day or two after birth. (You      might even want to milk out and freeze some colostrum, to      save for any orphaned newborns of future litters.) The      easiest way to make sure the new arrivals get their share      of the precious fluid, of course, would be simply to let      the youngsters nurse. Most goat breeders will start the      little milkers off on a bottle or pail, though, because      suckling kids are difficult to wean (and can be pretty      rough on udders), and nursing mothers tend to produce less      and dry up sooner than dams whose milk is handexpressed.    </p>    <p>      So if you want to promote productivity in your doe,      bottle-feed the kids-right from the start-with      four daily doses of 4 to 6 ounces of milk each. You can      then change to three 8- to 10-ounce diurnal feedings by the      time the youngsters are one week old ... gradually increase      the quantity of milk per serving to 12-14 ounces (again,      fed three times a day)... and start to decrease the amount      per feeding when the youngsters reach eight weeks of age.    </p>    <p>      And don't make the all-too-common mistake of overfeeding      those new kids, or your little slurpers will develop cases      of the runs faster'n you can fetch a pitchfork. Instead,      encourage the young'uns to munch on hay and grain at an      early age by having plenty of the solid foods around for      them to nibble. Rumen development, you see, is stimulated      by eating grain and hay (milk, on the other hand, passes      right by the ruminant chamber of a goat's four stomachs and      goes directly to the last digester, the abomasum), and the      sooner that cud-chewing organ begins its work, the faster      the kids will grow. If you do encourage such a vegetarian      diet, your kids should start sampling grain and greens by      the time they're three or four weeks old . . . and be ready      to be completely weaned when they're from 10 to 14 weeks of      age.    </p>    <p>      There are two other caretaking chores you should be sure to      attend to before your kids are three weeks old: disbudding      elf the young critters, and castrating any males you don't      expect to breed. The horns on <em>baby</em> goats' heads      are mere buttons that can be easily removed, but if you      allow the appendages to grow, you'll end up either with a      horned adult that's a potential menace to other livestock      (and to you), or with an extremely difficult dehorning      chore.    </p>    <p>      To disbud a kid, you first need to get hold of a disbudding      iron (some folks use a caustic <em>bovine</em> d isbudding      paste for this job, but I've seen too many goats' ears and      other hairy parts injured with that substance . . . so in      my opinion, the disbudder is the only way to go). You'll      also need to build or buy an appropriately sized wooden      restraining box that has a porthole for the youngster's      head.    </p>    <p>      Once you've got the kid securely immobilized, heat the      disbudding iron until the searing tool will quickly burn a      black ring in wood and then press the iron over a horn bud      for six seconds . . . rotating the disbudder slightly as      you hold it to ensure good contact with the nodule. Repeat      this process on the first hornlet, and then perform the      same double operation on the other bud . . . to ensure a      total of 10 to 15 seconds burning time on each horn      surface. When you're finished, the seared ring around the      bud will be slick and copper-colored.    </p>    <p>      On the same day that you disbud your kids, you should      castrate the young, nonbreeder bucks. For this procedure,      first disinfect your hands and each animal's scrotum. Then,      using a sterile knife or scalpel blade, slice off the      entire bottom third of the male's testicular sack. Now      grasp each testicle and gently pull it-and its      cord-out until it breaks off. Follow up this surgery      by applying some antibiotic powder (and a protective      dressing during fly season) and administering a dose of      tetanus antitoxin.    </p>    <p>      Most novice goalkeepers will be sorely upset by the kids'      agonized bleatings while the animals are being castrated or      disbudded. Don't let such carrying-on worry you, though,      because immediately after the operations are over, the      youngsters will quietly amble off to look for a tasty patch      of forage to nibble on . . . just as if nothing had ever      happened.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Preventing Ketosis and Milk Fever in the Pregnant      Doe</strong>    </p>    <p>      Not only should a pregnant doe's diet provide enough      protein, energy, minerals, and vitamins to feed both the      dam <em>and</em> her unborn kids, but the animal's menu      should also be carefully managed to help avoid two      relatively common caprine ailments: ketosis and milk fever.    </p>    <p>      Ketosis, or pregnancy toxemia, affects expectant does      shortly before they're due to give birth. A beast so      afflicted may go off its feed, grind its teeth, have a      peculiar odor, and-if the problem is allowed to      progress unchecked-eventually go into convulsions and      die. You can detect the ailment by checking the critter's      urine with a test powder or paper strip available in      drugstores. You should, though, be able to <em>prevent</em>      ketosis from becoming a problem in the first place, by      making sure every expectant doe has a high-energy diet      that's loaded with carbohydrates. Give your pregnant goats      one to two pounds of grain daily (along with their regular      hay or pasture feedings, of course) . . . especially during      the last three weeks before she's due to kid.    </p>    <p>      Milk fewer-on the other hand-occurs most      frequently <em>after</em> a doe gives birth. This disease      may cause restlessness, excitability, and lack of      coordination. Eventually the weakened animal may fail down      and be unable to get back up.    </p>    <p>      This deficiency disease can strike when a goat is using all      the calcium circulating through her bloodstream to make      milk for the offspring. To prevent the problem, give the      milking mother a diet high in calcium <em>and</em> make      sure-beforehand-that the darn will be ready to      utilize the mineral fully. You can accomplish the latter      task by first feeding the goat a diet that's low in the      bone-building nutrient during its two-month dry period.      (Good feeds for this purpose are grass hays-timothy      and prairie, for example-and such grains as corn,      wheat, milo, and oats. Be certain, also, that the animal's      mineral mix contains no calcium.)    </p>    <p>      Then, when the doe freshens, start feeding her a      high-calcium diet that includes <em>legume</em> hays, and      grains such as soybean, cottonseed, and linseed meal. In      that way, not only will the dam have a high level of      calcium in her daily menu, but her body will have been      primed to use every bit of the vital mineral.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HELP YOUR GOATS</strong> <strong>FIGHT THEIR OWN      DISEASES</strong>    </p>    <p>      The old saw, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of      cure", holds especially true for goats. So along with the      proper caretaking discussed in the rest of this article,      you should regularly administer some preventive medical      treatments to your caprine companions.    </p>    <p>      All goats should be given vaccines for tetanus and for      enterotoxemia, or overeating disease (caused by      <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> bacteria, types C and D).      Start your prevention program at the <em>prenatal</em>      stage by treating each expectant mother, for <em>both</em>      diseases, during her last month of pregnancy (use vaccines      that your vet can assure you will not harm the developing      fetuses). Then give both medications to the offspring when      the kids are 8 to 12 weeks old, and again 4 to 6 weeks      later.    </p>    <p>      Adult goats ought to be revaccinated yearly, and a      precautionary dose of tetanus antitoxin is a good safeguard      any time one of your animals gets a deep scratch or has      surgery. (In addition, check with your local veterinarian      to see if there are any other vaccines recommended      <em>specifically</em> for your area.)    </p>    <p>      Internal parasites are another problem you'll have to      fight. In fact, unless you work pretty Banged hard to      eliminate the hidden bandits, they can be the worst      livestock "rustlers" on your farm. You'd be wise to worm      all your goats each spring and fall (or once a month if      you've got a large herd). A local vet can recommend the      best vermicide to use in your location.    </p>    <p>      Goats are also afflicted by such external parasites as lice      and ticks, so you should treat your stock-in the      spring and fall-to control the blood-sucking      varmints. (Rotenone is a good organic duster for this job.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOAT TO IT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Well, you've now read all the basics of caretaking caprine      milkmakers, from choosing your stock to keeping them      disease-free. So if you like goat's milk as much as I      do-and think you'd enjoy sitting next to a nanny in a      straw-smelling barn twice each day while you stroke her      spigots-it's time for you to get a goat for your      barnyard. You'll never find a more agreeable (or more      profitable, when you consider how little the milk will cost      you) companion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOOF TRIMMING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Unless your goats spend a lot of time foraging in hard,      tacky places, each of the animals will need periodic hoof      trimming (otherwise the toe areas can grow-like      unclipped fingernails-and will eventually cripple the      critter). Most owners perform the task about once a month.      The job should take only a few minutes, and can be done      with a sharp packet or roofing knife . . . or even with a      pair of good garden pruning shears.    </p>    <p>      First off, securely restrain the goat (an assistant, or a      sturdy milking stand, can be a big help).      Next-standing with your back to the animal's      rear-lift one of the goat's hind legs. Clean out the      foot, and then start trimming off any curled-under edges or      obviously excess growth. (By the way, suet hoofs are a lot      easier to trim than are dry ones.) After that, carefully      cut thin layers off the bottom surface of the animal's      foot-the toe will probably need more pruning than the      heel-until you begin to approach the pinkish,      blood-filled layers. Check your work by seeing how squarely      the goat can stand, and then repeat the procedure on the      buck or doe's other hind foot.    </p>    <p>      Finish up by crouching along the beast's side and trimming      the goat's front hoofs. (And don't worry if you      accidentally cut a little too deeply and the pad starts to      bleed. Simply apply some pressure with a clean rag to the      injury to help stop the blood flow.)    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: You can learn more about raising goats on      the homestead level from the following resources .    </p>    <p>      [1] Dairy Goats: Breeding, Feeding, Management.
