        If you buy a hybrid before 2006, you can take a $2,000 deduction onyour federal income taxes. Basically, this deduction will reduceyour federal taxable income by $2,000. For hybrids bought afterJan. 1, 2006, the recently enacted energy bill set up tax credits ?ranging from $250 to $3,400, depending on the vehicle's fueleconomy. The credit would go toward your tax liability, the amountyou owe before any withholdings.<br /><br />Over the long term, the credit will be more advantageous to thosewho buy newer hybrid models and less helpful to those who buybetter-selling hybrids such as the Prius. The energy billestablished a complex formula to reduce the credits once anautomaker sells more than 60,000 hybrids after Jan. 1. Hybridbuyers in 14 states also can take advantage of state-levelincentives, including tax credits and exemptions from sales tax.Hybrid buyers in Colorado, for example, are eligible for taxcredits of more than $4,500. There also are nonfinancial incentives? such as being allowed to drive in lanes for high-occupancyvehicles and park without paying meter fees.
