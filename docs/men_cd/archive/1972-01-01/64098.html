    <p>
                <p>      The federal government owns over 765 million acres, or      one-third the total area (2.3 billion acres) of the United      States. About 500 million acres of this federally owned      land is classified as "forest and wildlife" and      approximately 100 million acres of the land so classified      is listed by the government as "commercial forest".    </p>    <p>      The Bureau of Land Management-which is a division of      the Department of the Interior roughly parallel to the      Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture-has      exclusive responsibility for the 60% (460 million acres) of      the federally owned land. While over hald of the BLM's      domain is in Alaska and-like much of the      rest-contains little or no timber, the Bureau of Land      Management does control several million acres of prime      forest in the Pacific Northwest.    </p>    <p>      According to a Department of the Interior organization      chart, BLM land is managed for these multiple uses:    </p>    <p>      fish and wildlife development,<br />      domestic livestock grazing,<br />      outdoor recreation,<br />      occupancy,    </p>    <p>      mineral production,<br />      timber production,<br />      watershed protection,<br />      preservation of public values on public land.    </p>    <p>      WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS DESCRIPTION?    </p>        <p>      <strong>THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT IS PROTECTING (?)      YOUR LAND</strong>    </p>        <p>      The spring of 1970 was a good time for John and Betsy      Morris. They'd just bought a sprawling 761 acres in the the      Windy Peak region of Oregon's Coastal Range, only 40 miles'      drive from Eugene.    </p>    <p>      The young couple's new farm was uncommonly      beautiful-wooded ridges rose steeply from pastures      watered by two forks of a clear, mountain stream-and      much of it was inaccessible except by foot or horseback.    </p>    <p>      John and Betsy had chosen Thornfield Farm partly      <em>because</em> of its seclusion. Refugees from the      city-John had been a department manager for      Montgomery Wards-they'd searched the pacific      Northwest for a quiet, natural setting in which to raise      their small children and launch an organic beef farm.      Thornfield's narrow, Y-shaped valley at the end of the      county road was ideal for both purposes.    </p>    <p>      John and Betsy felt strongly about preserving Thornsfield      Farm's wild beauty and they were pleased that their land      was bounded to the north and east by Bureau of Land      Management holdings. The Bureau of Land Management is the      Department of Interior agency charged with guarding the      public's interests on over 400 million acreas of U.S.      Government land and the adjacent BLM holdings seemed to      promise extra protection from commercial "development".    </p>    <p>      But the Morrises' faith in the benevolence of the BLM was      not to last. Toward the end of July, 1970-little more      than a month after they'd moved to Thornfield-a      neighbor's chance remark led them to the shocking discovery      that the BLM was planning two logging access roads through      their back-county retreat.    </p>    <p>      On August 14, John and Betsy met with the three BLM      officials at the Eugene District Office to learn the      government's intention first-hand. They were shown a map      illustrating the planned access routes. One road was to      climb the ridge behing their house (cutting across their      gravity-fed, surface-water collection system) and then      follow the ridge northeast along their property to      ultimately collect with another BLM road... thus creating a      through logging trail across Thornfield farm. The second      road-unbelievable as it sounds!-was to start      from their driveway, slice between their house and barn,      continue across their South Fork bottomland pasture... and      finally dead-end on BLM land.    </p>    <p>      Naturally-once they'd caught their breath-the      Morrises objected. They were wholeheartedly opposed to the      construction of ANY road through Thornfield Farm, let alone      <em>logging</em> roads. The three BLM      functionaries-Messrs. Von Domelan, Doren and      Schaffer-explained that although there were other      ways to get the Windy Peaks timber out, the proposed roads      were <em>the easiest and cheapest routes for the logging      companies</em> . They said flatly that there was nothing      John and Betsy could do to prevent the roads from being      built.    </p>    <p>      A month later, on September 16, Von Domelan and Doren drove      up unannounced and said they wanted to check the final      points on the road construction maps they had with them.      John refused to let them on the farm when they told him      this was the last step before actual construction began.    </p>    <p>      That's when the big guns were rolled out. Joseph Dose,      BLM's Eugene District Director, sent the Morrises a letter      on October 19, stating that he'd "requested condemnation      action on your property for the right to enter, survey and      mark on-the-ground the location of an easement for forest      access roads, to locate such an easement in relation to      established property corners, and to appraise the market      value of such an easement."    </p>    <p>      On February 25, 1971, and again on March 25, John's brother      David-now a business partner and also living at      Thornfield Farm-traveled to Washington, D.C. to talk      to Oregon Rep. John R. Dellenback and to national BLM      officials. David was told by Messrs. Lynd, Bowen and      Russell of the BLM that ALL responsibility for choosing      logging routes and implementing BLM policies in the Eugune      area lay in the hands of Dose, the district director.      Sorry, but nothing could be done at higher levels.    </p>    <p>      Meantime, the Morrises had hired an attorney, Michael      Schmeer, and Schmeer had written to various BLM officials      reminding them that they were bound by law to comply with      the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Public Law      91-190, 91st Congres, January 1,1970). NEPA specifically      provides that    </p>    <p>      it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal      Government to use all practicable means, consistent with      other essential considerations of national policy, to      improve and coordinated Federal plans, functions, programs,      and resources to the end that the Nation may (1) fulfill      the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the      environment for succeeding generations; (2) assure for all      Americans safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and      culturally pleasing surroundings; (3) attain the widest      range of beneficial uses of the environment without      degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable      and unintended consequences; (4) preserve important      historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national      heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment      which supposrts diveersity and variety of individual      choices...    </p>    <p>      So, when John and Betsy next met with a BLM      representative-on March 22, 1971 with Mr. Zimmerman,      BLM assistant state director in Portland-they weren't      surprised to learn that the BLM was suddenly concerned      about the environment. Zimmerman stressed the "fact" that      the planned road through Thornfield Farm were the most      ecologically sound routes, however, the bureaucrat fell      back on the logging company convenience theme. The through      road would open the Windy Peak region to loggers from the      Eugene area, he said, and the South Fork road was necessary      to "manage" 360 acres of forest in the upper valley.    </p>    <p>      On April 16, David Morris talked to Dose and his area      manager, Bill Bjorge. Dose said that the BLM was      investigating alternate passages and would continue to do      so even after winning access to Thornfield Farm through      court condemnation. Interestingly, Dose admitted that half      of the private property owners across whose land BLM want      to build roads object for reasons similar to the      Morrises'... but added that they all eventually come      around. Wonder why.    </p>    <p>      On May 18, John and Betsy were served notice that the      federal district court had granted the BLM temporary      possession of their farm to conduct all the activities      listed in Dose's letter October 19, 1970. Authority was      also conferred for "the United States of America, acting      through the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of      Interior, its representatives, agents or contractors... to      remove, sell, or otherwise dispose of any tree necessary to      such survey work." Nothing was said of the BLM's      environmental responsibilities or a search for alternate      routes.    </p>    <p>      Included in the court order was a clause informing the      Morrises that their "consent" would "constiture a waiver of      all defenses and objections" to the condemnation. So, of      course, they <em>had</em> to contest the decision. On June      7, 1971 Schmeer submitted an "Answer of Defendants"      and-after some legal maneuvering-a hearing was      set for July 12.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, the Morisses hadn't been idle. They'd prepared a      carefully detailed summary of their struggle with the      BLM-including the bureau's legal obligations under      NEPA-and on June 5 begain mailing it to everyone they      could think of: old friends, relatives, former teachers and      employers, congressmen... <em>anyone!</em>    </p>    <p>      Apparently the Morrises' action had some effect because      when David met with Dose on June 22, the district director      agreed to prepare an "Environmental Impact Statement" ...      as required by NEPA. He promised to accept a      counterstatement from the Morisses and Jean and David      Eastman, Betsy's siter and brother-in-law, who were also      living on Thornfield Farm at the time... and to include it      in his final report to the BLM. This from the man who in      March had told John and Betsy he wouldn't let petitions,      letters or any other form of public opinion sway him!    </p>    <p>      Back at the courthouse,      Schmeer-surprisingly-was able to get the court      order nullified on July 12. The court upheld the Morrises'      defense because, as Schmeer put it, the judge "was      reluctant to permit trees to be cut without some control."      (Makes it pretty obvious who wrote that court order in the      first place, doesn't it?) The assistant U.S. attorney who      was handling the government's side was "somewhat      disturbed", and threatened to take it to the Circuit Court      of Appeals. So far he hasn't.    </p>        <p>      But Schmeer warned John and Betsy that they shouldn't count      on continuing support from the courts. Once the BLM had an      Environmental Impact Statement on file-and providing      it isn't a terribly blatant sham-the court will      probably feel that the bureau has fulfilled its      obligations. Even if the Morrises continue to object,      Schmeer believes, it won't do any good... the court will      grant the BLM a permanent easement for the two logging      roads, and that will be the end of Thornfield Farm.    </p>    <p>      Still, John and Betsy wouldn't give up. They were      discouraged and disillusioned... but they kept on fighting.      On August 2, the residents of Thornfield Farm submitted a      statement to District Director Dose outlining their      objections to the access roads and suggesting several      possible alternatives. About the only reaction they've      gotten to it was the comment from one BLM employee that it      was "kind of emotional, wasn't it?" If you're emotional      about having your home destroyed, apparently your arguments      don't have to be answered.    </p>    <p>      Al Schaffer, one of the Eugene BLM officials the Morrises      first talked to way back August, 1970-remember when      John and Betsy thought being next to BLM land would protect      them from the loggers?-came out to Thornfield in      mid-September. He asked permission for government "experts"      to come on the farm and gather data for the environmental      study... permission which the Morrises readily granted.    </p>    <p>      John and Betsy also recall-with little real      amusement-Schaffer's mentioning how idealistic he was      about our government. The American government is truly      responsive to the individual, he said. A government agency      can't just come in and build a road through someone's      property... it has to go to some trouble first. Funny how      many idealists like that there are nowadays, isn't it?    </p>    <p>      Since that mid-September day, perhaps a dozen men have      visited Thornfield Farm to study various aspects of the      area, water quality, stream bed conditions, fish life,      forestry (of course), geological conditions, and so on. The      Morrises know that those men are not just hiking up into      the hills for a picnic-on occasion John and Betsy has      gone along-but what happens to the information the      "experts" gather is another story that no one will tell the      residents of Thornfield Farm.    </p>    <p>      The BLM has apparently established no timetable for      completing the environmental study. When asked about this,      Schaffer explained that he didn't want a deadline because      he was afraid the people working on the project might      become more concerned about the due date than the job at      hand. He did admit, however, that the basic resource data      wouldn't be completely gathered until spring. At that time      in interdisciplinary team of government experts will      evaluate the field reports and determine what the Windy      Peak area is "best suited for".    </p>    <p>      The recommendation of this team will then be discussed at a      public meeting of local citizens (suppose anyone besides      the Thornfield Farm folks will turn up?), before the matter      passes back into the hands of BLM Eugene District Director      Joe Dose.    </p>    <p>      From everything John and Betsy have been able to learn,      Dose still has the final say. No one in Portland or      Washington, D.C. has even so much as implied that his      decision might be overriden. Which says a lot in itself.      Consider: here we have a government official who is      admittedly basing his decision on what is "convenient" for      logging companies-to the detriment of the residents      of Thornfield Farm (who Dose is charged by law to      protect)-yet his superiors are prepared to      rubber-stamp whatever he does.    </p>        <p>      John and Betsy -needless to say aren't optimistic.      "We don't think that we can sit back now, put the future of      Windy Peak in the BLM's hands and relax. They haven't given      us much cause to trust them. For one thing, they termed      this about-face a 'victory' for us. When we think of a      victory we think of two opposing factions in a battle. Thus      it seems to us that, no matter what all their soil      scientists and fish biologists say, if the roads are not      built the BLM will consider it a defeat."    </p>    <p>      And we all know how our government feels about defeat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A STATEMENT OF THE IMPACT ON THE THORNFIELD      FARM<br />      HUMAN ENVIRONMENT OF TWO BLM FOREST ACCESS ROADS<br />      IF CONSTRUCTED AS PROPOSED</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Excerpted from the statement submitted to Joseph Dose      on August 2, 1971</em>    </p>    <p>      This statement provide detailed response to the National      Environmental Policy Act, Section 102 (C) regarding:    </p>    <p>      (i) THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED ACTION    </p>    <p>      NOISE A diesel truck at 50 feet emits 68 to 99 decibels of      noise. The danger level to humans is placed at 80 decibels.      One may be temporarily deafened by short exposures to 100      to 125 decibles and exposure to anything over 80 decibles      of noise for extended periods of time may cause permanent      deafness.    </p>    <p>      FILTH As we travel our driveway now, we see very little      traces of man's contamination of the land. There is no      litter along the roadside. The nearby trees are fresh and      green. This is in very sharp contrast to public road used      by logging companies. We find most objectionable beer cans      along the roadsides and boughs of trees so heavily laden      with dirt and dust that they droop toward the ground. We      also find objectionable the thought of having our garden,      which supplies most of our food, so contaminated.    </p>    <p>      DANGER With two very small children (22 months and 5      weeks), the danger of living in the midst of logging trucks      is very great. We fail to be pacified by the assurances of      the carefulness of logging company drivers-we see      much too much evidence to the contrary as we travel      Deadwood Creek Road.    </p>    <p>      There is also danger to livestock and pets. There is danger      to any of us walking or driving to our mailbox or barns.      These roads will provide a constant threat to our family's      safety.    </p>    <p>      VIOLATION OF PRIVACY These roads would open our land to      hunters (with added danger to our children and livestock),      fishermen and sightseers, thereby totally destroying the      privacy we have now and value so highly.    </p>    <p>      DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON CHOSEN LIVELIHOOD Should our      seclusion be destroyed, the continuation of our organic      beef operation would be jeopardized, as would be the base      for David Morris's artistic career. The difficulties of      raising uncontaminated beef would be compounded. The added      traffic could bring in pests and diseases which are not      present in our valleys now. The poisonous fumes from such      traffic would contaminate the meat and the excessive noise      would disturb growth patterns, thereby damaging the      well-being of our stock. The beauty, peace and serenity of      our farm which provides the perfect background for      free-lance art work and fine art expression would be      destroyed.    </p>    <p>      (ii)ANY ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS WHICH CANNOT BE      AVOIDED SHOULD THE PROPOSAL BE IMPLEMENTED.    </p>    <p>      Any location of the two proposed roads within our valleys      will have the same essential effect as the presently      proposed route locations. Whether the road up South Fork      Bear Creek goes above John and Betsy's home or below the      barn does not change the insult it imposes upon our style      of life and set of values. The adverse effects described in      (i) above therefore are unavoidable if either route, or      variations on either of them still within our valleys, is      carried out.    </p>    <p>      (iii) ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED ACTION    </p>    <p>      AIR LOGGING At numerous meetings and correspondence with      State and District BLM officials it has been pointed out      that the South Fork Bear Creek road is necessary to service      about 360 acres of timber. We question the economic wisdom      of expending public monies for easement purchases and road      construction to such a limited acreage. We believe such      money would be better spent in developing air logging      technology to a point where such permanent "improvements"      over private lands will no longer be "necessary". This      seems to be a positive alternative, a good investment in      the future of forest management and an idea which the      Department of Defense would receive in a cooperative spirit      considering the pressure they are under to provide civilian      jobs for returning servicemen trained in helicopter      operation under severe conditions.    </p>    <p>      EXPERIMENTAL USES Since the area at the head of the South      Fork Bear Creek road is of limited acreage, contained      within a district watershed and has not yet been enroached      upon by man beyond our farm boundaries (this is also true      of the Main Fork) we suggest other Federal, Regional, State      or local (such as the University of Oregon) agencies might      possibly find these conditions favorabe for research,      control studies or experimental stations involving no need      for heavy equipment access but yielding significant      contribution to man's attempts to undestand his      environment.    </p>    <p>      WILD AREA. A third alternative would to declare this      watershed a wild area, a wilderness preserve to be added to      the much needed wild reserves across the country,      unmolested and free from the marks of man's hands.    </p>    <p>      POSTPONEMENT OF TIMBER EXPLOITATION Finally, if no other      solution can be found, we suggest that at the very least      the 360 acres would be held in its present state until      technology in forest management has a chance to catch up      with the uphill logging problems in the upper reaches of      South Fork Bear Creek.    </p>    <p>      We state forthrightly that we do not recognize as      legitimate nor justified the BLM's inconveniencing our      families' lives, safety and future security so severely in      order to provide a transportation convenience for logging      companies and management crews who hold no personal      investment in maintaining or improving the quality of life      of the environment.    </p>    <p>      ABANDONMENT Because of the above, our first suggested      alternative is the obvious one because from our points of      view; abandon the idea of a through road system altogether,      relying instead entirely on the Greenleaf Creek Road for      access to the Windy Peak area.    </p>    <p>      BUCK CREEK ROAD Our second suggestion, if a through road      system is deemed "essential" is to use the already      established Duck Creek Road and extend it to tie into the      Greenleaf Creek Road.    </p>    <p>      ACCESS THROUGH KELLER PROPERTY The third suggestion, again      if through transportation is all-important, is to ascend to      the ridge from the northwest side across our neighbor, Dan      Keller's land since he is interested in having a BLM road      across his property and we most definitely are not.    </p>    <p>      (iv) THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL SHORT-TERM USES OF      MAN'S ENVIRONMENT AND THE MAINTENANCE OF ENHANCEMENT OF      LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY    </p>    <p>      We wonder if perhaps America's lumber needs and the export      of lumber in order to maintain economic balance in      international trade for, say, the next twenty years might      not be viewed as a short-term issue and the existence of      life on this planet as the vital issue in the "maintenance      of long-term productivity" and what the implications of      such a larger view are on our self-indulgent, high standard      of living in this country.    </p>    <p>      (v) ANY IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENTS OF      RESOURCES WHICH WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE PROPOSED ACTION      SHOULD IT BE IMPLEMENTED    </p>    <p>      We have heard much about sustained yield and modern forest      management techniques, all presented to assure us that care      is being taken to make the most of available forest lands      through intensive management. What we are more concerned      about is the changing of wild country into one large tree      farm operation without careful consideration of what is      being done in the process. We are concerned about what      happens to the wildlife patterns and inter-relationship in      an area as large as yet undisturbed as the Windy Peak area;      about what are the effects of logging operations and road      construction on run-off, stream silting and aquatic life;      about what other kinds of uses of such wild lands as these      might be needed in ten or twenty or fifty years for which      we might better plan this year while it still exist; about      these kinds of things we are concerned and we see no one in      this Federal agency actively and aggressively sharing these      concerns.    </p>
