                    <h5 id="byline">      by JUANITA KEITHLEY SCOTT    </h5>    <p>      Folks on limited budgets should know that they can stretch      their food pennies with a tasty, nutritious combination of      pinto beans and corn. Such a diet is not the marginal bill      of fare you might imagine, either. Rather, as generations      of poor people throughout Mexico and the southwestern      United States have proven, it can supply a fair amount of      the body's daily requirements of vitamins and minerals and      a goodly portion of the necessary proteins.    </p>    <p>      Neither beans nor corn alone, of course, is such a complete      food . . . chiefly because neither is a complete protein.      Beans, however, contain all the essential amino acids but      one (methionine) . . . which just happens to be the amino      acid that corn <em>does</em> have. Together, a mixture of      two parts corn and one part beans is almost equal in      protein quality to fresh milk. Add some fruits and      vegetables to supply the vitamins and minerals that beans      and corn lack and top with some real milk . . . and you've      got a fairly well-balanced diet that is both tasty and very      economical. The further addition of fresh wheat germ and an      occasional egg should round this menu off a lot closer to      nutritionally perfect than the "average" American diet      without raising the total cost too many pennies.    </p>    <p>      Now I'm not recommending that everyone completely switch      from sirloin steaks (or even hamburger) to a morning, noon      and night diet of pinto beans and corn. However, when      money's short or you're trying to save every extra nickle      for the down-payment on that farm, it is nice to know that      a regular substitution of corn and beans for a meat dish      can spin the old budget out by a rather large factor.    </p>    <p>      For instance, in New Mexico-where pinto beans are      dryfarmed in semi-arid fields-they may be purchased      in bulk at minimal cost. Even after the beans are shipped      half-way across the country, they usually sell at a      super-low price of 15-20 cents per pound (less than      10 cents a day per person) that will fit almost anybody's      food budget. <em>(I</em> <em>bought 10 pounds of bulk mixed      beans in West Virginia recently for only 10 cents a      pound.-JS)</em> Dry corn is just as inexpensive . . .      making the combination much more economical than meat, milk      or any other source of protein.    </p>    <p>      The following traditional recipes from the southwestern      section of this country will rapidly introduce you (if you      need an introduction) to both dried corn and pinto beans.    </p>        <h3>BEAN RECIPES</h3>    <p>      Pinto beans, or frijoles as they're called in Mexico, can      be prepared in a variety of mouth-watering ways. They      should always be cooked a long time at a low temperature      (that's the secret of making them tasty). An earthenware      pot is best for this cooking method but a metal kettle can      also be used with success.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PINTO BEANS (FRIJOLES)</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 cups beans<br />      10 cups water (approx.)<br />      4 tablespoons bacon fat or 1 cup diced salt pork<br />      2 garlic cloves, minced<br />      2 teaspoons sugar<br />      2 teaspoons paprika<br />      1 teaspoon chili powder<br />      salt to taste<br />    </p>    <p>      Pick rocks, seed or bad beans from the pintos. Wash and      cover with water and let the beans soak overnight. If the      pintos haven't been soaked, put them over heat, bring to a      boil, cover, turn off heat and let the beans sit for one      hour before continuing with the cooking process. Add sugar      and garlic to the pintos, place them over heat, cover and      simmer.    </p>    <p>      Throw in some bacon fat or a chunk of salt pork after the      beans have cooked at least a half hour and add enough      boiling water during cooking to keep the pintos covered.      Depending on altitude and water softness, the total cooking      time will be three to six hours.    </p>    <p>      Add paprika and chili powder when the pintos are about half      done and, after they've become tender, add salt and cook 15      to 20 minutes or until the seasoning has cooked into the      beans and the juice has slightly thickened.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEAN CAKES</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 cups mashed beans<br />      1 small onion, chopped<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      2 tablespoons cornmeal<br />      1 tablespoon flour<br />      1 teaspoon chili powder<br />    </p>    <p>      Mash beans with a fork and add cornmeal, salt, flour and      chili powder. Stir well. Add the chopped onion and mix      until well blended. If the mixture is too dry, thin it with      bean juice or a small amount of water. Heat a skillet and      grease it with bacon drippings. When the pan is hot, drop      in the bean mixture by the spoonful and mash each cake flat      with a spoon. Brown and serve.    </p>    <p>      <strong>REFRIED BEANS (FRIJOLES REFRITOS)</strong>    </p>    <p>      Melt about three teaspoons of bacon fat for each cup of      leftover beans (the fat keeps the beans from losing their      flavor). Add a little flour and some chopped onions or hot      chili peppers to the pintos and spoon them into the hot      grease. Grated cheese may be melted into the beans just      before they're taken off the fire. Serve piping hot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PINTO BEAN SANDWICH</strong>    </p>    <p>      Pinto bean sandwiches served with tall glasses of iced tea      add zest to any lunch.    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup pinto beans, mashed with fork<br />      1 tablespoon chopped green chili peppers<br />      1 tablespoon chopped or grated onions<br />      1 tablespoon diced celery or dill pickles<br />    </p>    <p>      Add the other ingredients to the mashed beans and spread      the mixture on slices of homemade bread or roll it into a      tortilla. Top with lettuce or mustard greens.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PINTO BEAN SALAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 cups cooked pinto beans, drained<br />      2 green chili peppers, chopped<br />      2 cucumbers, chopped<br />      1/2 cup grated cheese<br />      1/2 small onion, chopped<br />      1/2 cup diced celery<br />      2 medium tomatoes, sliced<br />      salt and pepper to taste<br />    </p>    <p>      Toss with three tablespoons salad oil and serve on lettuce      leaf.    </p>    <h3>CORN RECIPES</h3>    <p>      The corn tortilla, piping hot from the griddle, or a      skillet of bright yellow cornbread-with a platter of      sliced red tomatoes, fresh green onions and a tall glass of      ice cold milk served with that steaming pot of pinto      beans-will round out a luscious, penny-saving meal.      To make the tortilla, you'll first need some lime hominy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LIME HOMINY (NIXTAMAL)</strong></p>    <p>      (Hominy from blue native or concho corn is considered best      for tortillas, but other varieties can be used      successfully.)</p><p> 2 quarts corn<br />      4 heaping tablespoons powdered lime (purchased from the      hardware store)<br />      4 quarts water<br />    </p>    <p>      Dissolve the lime in water and then add the corn. Stir well      and put the mixture in a granite or enameled pan (do not      use a metal container). Place the water-lime-corn mixture      over low heat and cook until the hulls loosen from the      kernels. Remove from heat, drain off the liquid and wash      the corn several times in cold water until all the lime is      removed and the water is clear.    </p>                                   <p>      <strong>LIME HOMINY TORTILLAS (TORTILLAS DE      NIXTAMAL)<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      With lime hominy in hand, you're ready to make tortilla      dough, or masa.    </p>    <p>      Run the hominy through the medium knife of a food chopper      several times. If it's too dry, add a bit of water so the      masa will hold together. Shape the dough into balls the      size of a hen egg, place one end of a damp kitchen towel on      a flat, hard surface, put a ball of masa on it and cover      the dough with the other end of the towel. Flatten the      tortilla with a small board or rolling pin until it's about      1/8inch thick. Or-if you prefer-work the ball      into a large, thin pancake with your hands. Lightly grease      a griddle and cook the tortilla on both sides.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OLD FASHIONED CORNBREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 cups yellow cornmeal<br />      1 cup flour<br />      3 tablespoons bacon drippings<br />      2 eggs<br />      2 tablespoons sugar<br />      1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br />      1 1/2 cups milk<br />      3 teaspoons baking powder    </p>    <p>      Measure cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into      a bowl and stir. Add milk, mix well, add eggs and beat      thoroughly. Stir in the bacon drippings and beat again      until well blended. Melt two tablespoons of fat in a heated      cast iron skillet, pour the batter into the hot pan and      place it in a 400° F. oven. Cook about 40 minutes, or      until the cornbread is lightly browned on top. If thinner,      crustier bread is desired, divide the batter into two      skillets and bake it about 25 minutes.    </p>    <p>      1 cup yellow cornmeal,<br />      1/2 cup flour<br />      2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      2 cups milk<br />      2 eggs<br />      1 can green chili peppers, chopped<br />      1 cup grated cheese<br />      4-5 tablespoons melted butter or bacon drippings<br />      1/2 t easpoon garlic powder (optional)    </p>    <p>      Mix the dry ingredients together, add milk and beat well      Add butter or fat, stir, drop in eggs and beat vigorously      until well blended. Stir in grated cheese, pour the batter      into hot, greased skillet and place the pan in a 325° F      oven. Bake 50 minutes and serve hot.</p>      <p>      <strong>DRIED BEANS AND CORN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Both beans and corn can be dried and kept for long periods      and Kept of time with very little loss of flavor or      nutritional value. Dry ing is a handy method of preserving      the foods because the process reduces 100 pounds of either      to only about 10 pounds    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE DRYER</strong>    </p>    <p>      You can quite quite easily and inexpensively construct a      drying tray or trays to use over your stove or range. Make      the trays whatever size you find handiest by nailing      together rectangular frames of 1/2 X 2-inch wooden strips      and tacking small mesh wire screening across the frames'      bottoms. The tray may be suspended from the ceiling and      used while cooking or-if this is      inconvenient-hung from a framework crane that may be      swung out of the way when not in use.    </p>    <p>      One important point: when drying any kind of food ova an      oil stove, a tin or galvanized sheet should be placed below      the bottom tray to prevent oil fumes from reaching and      penetrating the edibles.    </p>                         <p>      <strong>DRYING BEANS</strong>    </p>    <p>      After the beans have matured and dried on the vine they      should be shelled, placed on the drying racks and heated to      165-180° F. for 10 to 15 minutes. This will destroy any      insect eggs in the beans. If you don't want to build trays,      spread the beans on a flat baking pan and put them in the      oven. The beans are dry enough when they no longer stick      together after you squeeze a few in your hand, or when a      single bean can be pressed without moisture coming to the      surface. Remove the beans from heat and let them      cool.</p>      <p><strong>DRYING CORN</strong></p>    <p>      Dried sweet corn can be used in many delightful and      economical soups, breads, casseroles and stews. Select      freshly gathered ears in the milk stage, ready for table      use. Blanch the corn by wrapping the ears in a piece of      cheesecloth or placing them in a wire basket or similar      porous container, and plunging them into boiling water for      8-12 minutes to set the milk. Blanching gives the corn a      thorough cleaning, removes objectionable flavors and odors,      kills bacteria and softens and loosens the fiber to allow      quicker and more uniform evaporation of moisture during      drying. Do not blanch longer than the prescribed time or      color will be lost, the starch will partially cook to a      paste and-worst of all-some of the valuable      nutrients will dissolve out.    </p>    <p>      After blanching, drain the corn well and slice off the rows      of kernels with a sharp knife. Spread the corn one layer      deep on a drying rack or put it in a pan in a 130° F.      oven. Gradually raise the temperature to 140° F. while      stirring frequently. When the corn is hard and      semi-transparent remove it from the trays and let it      cool.    </p>   <p><strong>STORAGE CONTAINERS</strong></p>    <p>      When the dry beans and corn have cooled, place them in milk      cartons (the wax coating makes these cartons great for      storage) or some other light and insect-proof boxes, bags      or cans. The containers should not be completely air-tight      since the corn and beans must be allowed to "breathe" as      they continue to dry in the      cans.   </p>   <p><strong>CONDITIONING</strong></p>    <p>      Both beans and corn should be conditioned daily for the      first 10-14 days after drying. Keep the containers open and      covered only with clean, dry cloth during this time, and      stir the dried products or pour them from container to      container regularly. When no change in moisture content has      been observed for several days, the food is ready for      permanent storage.   </p>   <p><strong>STORAGE</strong></p>    <p>      After conditioning, the dried corn and beans may be sealed      in the containers and stored for long periods of time if      kept warm, dry, well-ventilated and protected from insects      and rodents. Check the boxes, cans and/or bags from time to      time and-if any dampness is found-remove the      contents, dry them in a warm oven and return the corn and      beans to the containers.   </p>    <p><strong>REVITALIZING DRIED BEANS AND CORN</strong></p>    <p>      Approximately three to five cups of water must be added to      a recipe for every cup of dried corn or beans. Before using      the dried corn, cover it with water and soak the kernels      until they are swollen. Add enough water to cover the      swelled kernels (if necessary), put in a bit of honey or      sugar and bring the corn to a boil. Then turn the heat down      and cook the corn slowly until it's almost tender. Salt,      pepper and butter to taste and finish cooking.    </p>    <p>      Dried corn may also be run through a food chopper and added      to soups at the same time that onions and carrots are      dropped into the boiling water.    </p>    <p>      <em>FAR LEFT: Lime hominy tortillas.
