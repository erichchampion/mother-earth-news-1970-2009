        <p id="byline">Purchase two cards of thumbtacks, enough for eighty-eight keys. Choose tacks with bare metal heads for a loud ricky-tick/harpsichord sound and pick plastic-coated heads for a softer, less metallic tone.</p><p>Now, raise or unhinge the front of the piano to get at the hammers which are oval shape, made of felt and strike the strings. Gently pull a hammer toward you and feel for the spot where it hits home. You should find three grooves or string imprints. Locate the middle groove and push a tack firmly into its center. Press a tack into each hammer and replace the front of the piano.</p><p>Now break out some beer barrel songs or Bach or Scariatti.</p><p>The new sound is louder than the old and the keyboard action may be faster. If your hand falls heavy on the keys, a rousing ricky-tick tone will result. A lighter touch will bring out the delicate strains of a harpsichord and a whisper-light stroke might produce sounds approaching that of a clavichord. Sometimes, if the humidity, the mood, and the music are all just right you may feel like John Sebastian Bach himself at the keyboard of a rosewood harpsichord in a vast Baroque music hall.</p><p>If you get tired of the new sound you'll find that the tacks come out easily . . . but save them just in case you again get the urge to transport your playing back in time.</p>
