                      <h5 id="byline">by JOHN D. CUDDY:</h5>            <p>      Is the money you've been saving for a place in the country      burning a hole in your bankbook because you can't seem to      find a farm that you can afford? Well, maybe you should      take a look at northern Minnesota . . . where good land      still sells for under $50 an acre.    </p>    <p>      My wife and I started our search for acreage in Oregon and      northern California, but soon discovered that prices there      were sky-high on everything but the largest tracts. So we      sent away for the Strout and United real estate catalogs      and-after reading them carefully-decided there      were only four areas of the United States where land fell      within our reach . . . the Deep South, Appalachia, northern      New England and the upper Midwest.    </p>    <p>      After hashing over the pro's and con's of homesteading in      each region, we agreed to take a closer look at Minnesota      and Wisconsin and-once again-turned to the      experts by writing United and requesting a survey of the      farms available there. Since we were planning to visit      relatives in Minnesota anyway, we asked that the      information be mailed to that address.    </p>    <p>      When we arrived at our relatives' place, we found a stack      of folders waiting for us. Of the 200 or so properties      described, about 20 seemed especially appealing and the      majority of those interesting tracts were in northern      Minnesota. We were soon back in the car and heading north.    </p>    <p>      We talked to several realtors in Bimidji and thought we      were asking a lot when we told them we wanted an old farm      of about 100 acres, fairly isolated and available for a      down payment of less than $1,500. To our happy surprise,      several of the agents had something to offer!    </p>    <p>      The first place we looked at was really nice: 120 acres,      mostly wooded, with a small cabin and a shallow well for      $4,900 ($1,500 down). The second farm we were shown was      even more beautiful: 159 acres, six-room house, two sheds,      a deep well and mostly open land for $5,900 ($1,500 down).      We were ready to buy but resolved to look further to see if      there were any better deals around. There were . . . and      still are!    </p>    <p>      We checked with real estate agents all over northern      Minnesota and found-in just one week!-eight old      farms of from 80 to 160 acres. Each place had at least some      useable buildings and they ranged in price from $6,000 down      to a low of $3,500! Terms of sale were usually one-fourth      down with five years to pay the balance. And, as an added      and unexpected extra, most of the realtors we dealt with      were very upfront and helpful.    </p>    <p>      While we were in the market for a farm we looked into the      Tax Forfeit Land Sales . . . and found even better prices      on unimproved land. County tax assessors in Minnesota      generally have two lists of tax-due property. One describes      acreage which will be offered in the coming auction and for      which you must bid, in person, at the sale. The other (and      you may have to as,. for this one) catalogs land not sold      at previous auctions as which you can purchase at any      time.<br />    </p>    <p>      Each parcel of back-tax land is listed by range, township      and section. With this information (and a little help from      the assessor) you can locate the property on the county map      or in the more-detailed plat book. Ask if aerial      photographs are available . . . they sometimes are and can      give you a very specific idea of the topography of the area      in which a parcel lies.    </p>    <p>      The list of tax land also gives the exact acreage of each      property and the appraised value of its land, timber and      any buildings left by former owners. This appraised      value-land plus timber plus buildings-is the      minimum price you may pay for any parcel. If you buy at      auction you may have to spend more for a choice tract but      if you find something on the "old" list that you like, you      can get a real bargain.    </p>    <p>      At least my wife and I did! An old farm-120 acres      unused for ten years-with a seven room house, ten      stall barn, separate hay barn, chicken coop, old      schoolhouse, deep well, 45 acres of open fields and 75 of      woodland. We paid $2,000 down and hold a six-year contract      on the remaining $3,000. That figures out to around $42 an      acre... with all the buildings thrown in free.    </p>    <p>      Sound good? Believe me, it is! So don't just sit there . .      , some beautiful old farm may be just waiting up here in      Minnesota for you to come and claim it.    </p>
