                    <h5 id="byline">      by Janet Knickerbocker    </h5>        <p>      My first attempts at cheese-making were less than      successful, to say the least. The first batch I made was      simply terrible. My dear husband tried, bravely, to eat it.      I finally threw it out to the chickens, who eyed it      suspiciously and left it for dead. I think a poor possum      finally finished it off.    </p>    <p>      We learn through trial and error, and now I turn out a      mighty fine cheese. Two favorite, easy recipes follow.    </p>    <p>      Cheesemaking is now routine when the goats are producing      milk. I make extra and freeze it for the winter. You can      also freeze the milk in plastic gallon jugs. The curd made      from the frozen milk isn't as solid, but it's nice to be      able to make a fresh cheese when the goats are dry. Thaw      and shake well to redistribute the cream. Then make cheese      as usual.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Sources for Cheesemaking    </h3>    <p>      The following catalogs offer rennet and other cheese-making      supplies.

You'll need      plastic cheese molds. (See "Tips" below.)<br />    </p>    <p>      To 1 1/2 gallons of whole goat milk, add 1 cup buttermilk.      Let this stand at room temperature (70 degrees) for 2 hours      to ripen. Heat milk slowly to 86 degrees. Dissolve one-half      tablet rennet in 1/2 cup lukewarm water. Gently stir into      milk and let rest until curd is formed and begins to      separate from whey (liquid). Using a slotted spoon, scoop      large curds into molds, filling the molds to the top.      Sprinkle 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt over each and set to drain      on rack.    </p>    <p>      The next day the cheese will have shrunk to half the size      of the mold. If it's firm and holds its shape it's ready to      remove from the mold. Gently slide knife blade around edge      of mold to remove cheese. Set each cake on a rack to drain      further. After a bit of a rind has formed (several hours),      powder some salt in a blender and rub on outside of cheese.      After it has aged to desired flavor (two to five days in a      cool place), cover and place in refrigerator. It will keep      for about a week.    </p>    <p>      <em>Serving ideas:</em> Crumble and mix with some garlic      salt, minced onions or fresh chives, and serve on crackers      or crusty French bread. I also like it in salads or as a      topping for baked potatoes.<br />    </p>    <h3>      MILD CHEDDAR    </h3>    <p>      This cheese is wonderful grated and used to top homemade      pizzas. It's also a tasty topping for burgers.    </p>    <p>      To 1 gallon whole goat milk add 1/2 cup buttermilk and let      stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Heat milk very      slowly to 86 degrees, then add one-half tablet rennet      dissolved in M cup lukewarm water. Cover kettle and let sit      about 45 minutes, during which time curd will form. Cut the      curd, slowly slicing large curds with knife. Do not drain      whey. Start heating slowly to 102 degrees. Stir      occasionally for even heating and to prevent scorching.      Remove from heat and immediately pour curds into colander      lined with cheesecloth. Drain briefly. Gently roll curds      back and forth in cloth to drain off excess whey. (Whey can      be saved and fed to pigs. They love it.) Salt curds with      about 1 1/2 teaspoons salt or to your taste.    </p>    <p>      To drain and mold the cheese: Gather up corners of      cheesecloth and tie with string. Hang on cabinet knob over      a bowl, and by morning most of the whey will have drained      off. This cheese will not keep as long as a pressed cheese,      so use within two to three days or freeze it. Freezing will      change its consistency, but the cheese is fine for grating      when partially thawed.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tips:</strong> If you don't have a dairy      thermometer, 86 degrees feels lukewarm to the touch, and      102 degrees is very hot but still tolerable.    </p>    <p>      You can buy cheese molds or make your own from inexpensive,      16-ounce plastic tumblers. Perforate each tumbler by      running a hot 10-penny nail through the bottom and up the      sides in a random pattern. The more small holes, the better      the whey drains. Rinse out cups before you use them to wash      away any plastic residue.    </p>
