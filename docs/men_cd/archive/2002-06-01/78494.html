        <p>I was going back through some of my old issues of <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> and came across an article about making wire-mesh tomato towers. I remember glossing over the article since I have employed these for the last eight years. I did want, however, to share something I just started doing these last few years. I wanted to extend my growing season a few more weeks but didn't want to spend a lot of extra cash. I then had the idea to open my tomato towers, lay them down lengthwise over prepared beds (6 feet long by 2 feet wide) and use plastic sheeting (cut into the appropriate lengths) to make the best little greenhouses in Kansas. I was able to add three weeks to my growing season by using these minigreenhouses.</p><p><strong>FATHER PAUL AGIOPAVLITES</strong><br />Wichita, Kansas</p><p><em>For more on this very idea, see "Wire Mesh in the Garden," Page 96-MOTHER</em></p>
