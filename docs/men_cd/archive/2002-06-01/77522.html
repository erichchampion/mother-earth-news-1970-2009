                		 <p><strong>      Cooking with The Sun</strong>    </p>		    <p>      For solar ovens, cooking conditions couldn't be better than      during the summer months. Not only does cooking with      sunshine mean lower energy costs and cooler temperatures      indoors, but many solar oven champions say food simply      tastes better.    </p>    <p>      Practically anything you can cook in a conventional oven      can be made with a solar cooker. Solar ovens follow a      method similar to slow cookers, so food doesn't bum or dry      out. On a clear day, temperatures in a solar oven can reach      300 degrees. Cooking times depend on what goes in the pot.      Eggs, rice, vegetables, fish and chicken can take as little      as one to two hours on a sunny day. The same conditions can      also cook potatoes, bread, beans and most meat within four      hours. Large roasts, soups and stews take the longest at      five to eight hours. Even a cloudy day has solar cooking      potential, as long as there's at least 20 minutes of sun      per hour.    </p>    <p>      Solar ovens come in three models. The most common are box      cookers ($200 and up, pictured at right), which trap heat      using an angled reflective surface, such as a mirror,      aluminum foil or Mylar, and a dark, metal tray bottom. One      downside of the box cooker is having to adjust the box's      position during long cooking times. The concave reflectors      of a parabolic oven cook food twice as fast as a box      cooker, but the high price tag ($700) and potential for      bums and blindness from the directed rays make them      impractical for home use. Panel cookers ($20) combine      elements of both models. These ovens concentrate light      using flat instead of concave reflectors while an oven      roasting bag placed around a black pot acts as the heat      trap. At $20, panel cookers are much more affordable than      box cookers or parabolic cookers.    </p>    <p>      You can buy box or panel solar ovens from several U.S.      manufacturers or build your own. Solar Cookers      International, a nonprofit group in Sacramento, has a      comprehensive solar cooking Web site, including detailed      instructions for both models. The address is      www.solarcooking.org .    </p>    <p>      <em>-Julie Monahan</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>More Great Ideas on Good Living</strong>    </p>    <p>      A magazine promoting the "nourishment of soil, soul and      society" ought to be right up most <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      readers' alley. So we recommend you take a look at the      beautiful and satisfying <em>Resurgence magazine,</em>      founded 35 years ago by Satish Kumar, a former Jain monk.    </p>    <p>      <em>Resurgence thoughtfully</em> investigates renewable      energy, ecological economics, the endangered environment      and other ideas on the cutting edge of current thinking.      Promoting creativity, ecology, spirituality and frugality,      <em>Resurgence argues</em> for politics with principle and      science with a soul in beautifully illustrated articles by      some of the world's leading writers, such as Jeremy Rifkin,      Vandana Shiva and Wendell Berry. Subscriptions are $50 for      surface mail ($62 for airmail) and are available at      www.resurgence.org or by mail at <em>Resurgence;</em>      Rocksea Farmhouse; St. Mabyn, Bodmin; Cornwall PL30 BR,      UK.<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Resurgence has</em> teamed with the Omega Institute for      Holistic Studies to offer a series of annual conferences      where visionaries, authors and activists can come together      to renew their vision and inspire each other. The second      annual Resurgence conference will be held September 5-8 on      the Omega campus near Rhinebeck, New York.    </p>    <p>      Speakers include Thomas Moore, best-selling author of Care      <em>of</em> the Soul, Rituals <em>of</em> the      <em>Imagination and</em> Soul Mates; Paul Hawken, author of      Natural Capitalism, The Next Economy and The Ecology      <em>of</em> Commerce; Juliet Schor, author of The      <em>Overworked American</em> and The Overspent American;      Cathrine Sneed, founder and director of The Garden Project,      a program providing job and life training for former      prisoners; Frances Moore Lappe, author of Diet for a Small      Planet and her new book, Hope's <em>Edge: The</em> Next      Diet for a Small Planet (See Page 44); and author, inventor      and entrepreneur Gunter Pauli, founder and director of the      nonprofit Geneva-based Zero Emissions Research Initiatives.    </p>    <p>      For information, visit www.eomega.org or call (800)      944-1001.    </p>    <p>      - K.

Compton    </p>    <p>      Agritourism:<br />      Profit from your lifestyle    </p>        <p>      From Maine to Illinois, buses filled with schoolchildren      and conventioneers visit farms to pick a bunch of lavender,      go maple sugaring, harvest a personalized pumpkin, pet baby      animals or take a picture of grandchildren running through      a corn maze. It's called agritourism, and it is providing      an alternative source of income for many families. The work      is often seasonal and varies depending on what the farm or      ranch has to offer tourists.    </p>    <p>      New York State provides advertising and promotion of      agritourism along the 500-mile St. Lawrence Seaway Trail.      Some Northeast farmers offer bed and breakfast      accommodations for skiers or hikers. The western    </p>    <p>      United States with its vast mountain ranges and rugged      natural scenery specializes in ranching, camping, trail      rides, hunting and fishing, large animals and the      chuckwagon.    </p>        <p>      After surveying Texas farm entertainment opportunities,      Texas A&M University converted pan of its 2,700-acre      ranch near Alice, Texas. Dubbed LaCopita Ranch, it's the      first university-connected facility for training landowners      and managers for agri-tourism. According to Miles Phillips,      the program includes economic training and preparation for      jobs on ranches where the owners may want to develop an      ecotourism enterprise, but not manage it themselves.    </p>    <p>      LaCopita Ranch started offering tours this spring. Hiking      through native "South Texas mixed brush," tourists see      white-tailed deer, javelina, bobwhite quail, doves and      numerous nongame species. LaCopita plans half-day guided      tours of the ranch for groups, as well as overnight stays      for groups and individuals, with bunkhouse accommodations,      a short guided program and free time to explore the ranch      by bicycle or on foot, and a chance to hear country music      nearby.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Katherine Adam</em>    </p>    <p>      Resources:    </p>        <p>      E ntertainment Farming and Agritourism    </p>    <p>      www.attra.org/attra-pub/entertainment.html<br />      (800) 346-9140    </p>    <p>      Miles Phillips, Extension Ecotourism<br />      Specialist at LaCopita Ranch    </p>    <p>      mdphillips@ag.tamu.edu<br />      agfacts.tamu.edu/-mphillips<br />      (361)265-9203    </p>    <p>      The Farm & Ranch Recreation Handbook    </p>    <p>      uwadmnweb.uwyo.edu/RanchRecr    </p>    <p>      The MAiZE, corn maze makers    </p>    <p>      2361 S.

Few survive. Direct      hits are not the only danger however. In open terrain,      nearby strikes also can electrocute. But it is possible to      survive unscathed-by following a special rule.    </p>    <p>      The best way to avoid lightning is to take shelter. But      sometimes we're caught in open terrain by sudden lightning,      with no safe haven in sight. Most of us are tempted to hit      the dirt. Of course, being a tall target is bad, but      electricity flowing horizontally from head to foot on a      person lying on the ground can be lethal.    </p>    <p>      Your best bet for survival: Crouching way down with feet      together and hands off the ground. Sound a little weird      (and awkward)? The answer is in the physics.    </p>    <p>      When a wandering cow is killed by nearby lightning (which      strikes the ground or a lone tree), <em>ground current</em>      traveling from the strike point is usually blamed. The main      culprit is voltage: the electrical force that causes ground      current to flow. Current is merely electrons bumping each      other along an electrical path. The higher the voltage, the      greater the current flow.    </p>    <p>      Lightning striking earth is the result of a stormy      sky-which electrifies clouds with many million volts.      When a bolt of lightning hits the ground or trees, the bolt      sends current from the strike point (or tree base) out over      a sizeable circular area. This happens because the bolt      distributes a very high voltage across that      surface-but just for an instant. (Close to the      strike, that can be many thousands of volts per square      foot!) Cows roaming the area (especially those facing      directly in line with the strike point) receive a lethal      jolt between their widely separated legs.    </p>    <p>      For anyone standing near a lightning strike, the distance      between their feet is also critical. Humans might appear      safer than cattle-yet 600 or 800 volts flowing      between soggy shoes is just like stepping on the third rail      of an electric railway!    </p>    <p>      During a thunderstorm, nobody should be in open terrain or      under lone trees. A lone tree is the tallest electrical      path in an area and, if struck, a tremendous voltage fans      out from the tree's base. For a golfer near the strike,      with feet 10 inches apart, it could be curtains. (Going      into dense woods is somewhat better; inside an automobile      is best.)    </p>    <p>      If you can't get to shelter, make yourself as small as      possible and limit the amount of area you cover. So don't      lie down or stand up. Become a ball instead.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Walter S. Andariese</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fuel</strong> <strong>from Straw</strong>    </p>    <p>      Ethanol fuel was hailed as the savior of both farm country      and the environment-in 1992. Since its introduction,      ethanol hasn't exactly stolen the renewable energy      spotlight.    </p>    <p>      The problem isn't performance: Ethanol does burn cleaner      than petroleum products. For environmentalists, the problem      lies with production.    </p>    <p>      Mostly made from corn, ethanol production eats up a good      deal of fuel. U.S. cornfields are addicted to oil: oil for      pesticides, oil for fertilizers, oil for planting and oil      for harvesting. All that oil use takes a little of the      shine off ethanol's clean record.    </p>    <p>      But corn isn't the end-all and be-all of alcohol fuels. The      logen Corporation of Ottawa, Ontario, has developed a      process that produces ethanol from much less      energy-intensive sources, such as wood chips and straw. The      process is very similar to ethanol production from      corn-or, for that matter, alcohol made for human      consumption.    </p>    <p>      Logen's demonstration plant went online earlier this year.      The plant turns straw from nearby wheat and barley fields      into ethanol that is then sold to local reblenders. The      plant is currently the only one of its kind in the world,      although logen is looking for places to expand, including      the Canadian prairie, U.S. Midwest and the United Kingdom.    </p>    <p>      For more information, go to logen's Web site at      www.logen.ca.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Sarah Beth Cavanah</em>    </p>
