    <meta name="description" content="June/July 2002 | Whether your property is one acre or several hundred, sloping or flat, crowded with brush orcompletely forested, you can still raise dairy goats for milk. Two goats will produce enough quality fresh milk—with each doe averaging 3 quarts a day for 10 months—to feed your family all year. Add a few more goats and youll have enough milk for making cheese, yogurt or even ice cream. By Kris Wetherbee" />

        Great brush managers, goats thrive on hilly terrain and feed on leaves and twigs.
