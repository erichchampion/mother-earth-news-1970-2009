                    <h5 id="byline">      by Carol Mack    </h5>        <p>      Edited by Carol Mack    </p>    <h3>      Maritime Canada and New England    </h3>    <p>      June is time to eat big salads. Gather early summer flowers      like violets, yarrow and red clover to dry for teas and for      tincturing. Harvest culinary and medicinal herbs like lemon      balm, mint, French tarragon, summer savory and basil before      they go to seed. Eat lots of fresh vegetables and soak up      the summer heat. The ground has finally warmed enough to      safely set out tender pepper, melon and squash seedlings,      as well as any gourd seedlings. Plant green beans, summer      lettuces, more oriental greens, broccoli raab and      late-season brassicas. Late carrots can be planted now that      the first hatch of carrot fly has passed. The empty      greenhouse is a great place to start perennials for fall      transplanting. July brings the first tender      broccoli-so green, so buttery-and those early      tomatoes: It's starting to feel like heaven. Fall plantings      of shell peas must be in the ground before July 10 to get a      good crop. Soak the peas for three to four hours before      planting and keep well watered. Choose your coolest      location for best results. Open ground can be cover-cropped      with buckwheat, oats or any crop that meets your      soil-fertility and weed-control needs.    </p>    <h3>      Mid-Atlantic    </h3>    <p>      As the June heat sets in, plant successions of corn, beans,      cucumbers and summer squash every week. Lettuce lovers, to      keep the salads coning try planting some 'Sweet Valentine'      and 'Slobolt' in a fertile place with afternoon shade.      Peas, brassicas, cucumbers and summer squash should be      harvested every other day, not every third. Plant late      potatoes. Weed any time you can. Mulch the rest of the      time. In early July, try running chickens in your old      brassicas for two weeks to control harlequin bugs. Harvest      potatoes when the tops die down. Midmonth, stop planting      sweet corn and start your fall brassicas, lettuce, Chinese      greens, leeks and green onions in flats. To know if your      tomatoes are truly ripe, take a big bite of one. If the      juice drips from your elbows before you swallow, it's ripe.      If you get a ripe tomato by the beginning of July, you did      well.    </p>    <h3>      Southern Interior    </h3>    <p>      Summer is upon us, and like many gardeners you're      undoubtedly proudly reviewing your growing efforts on a      daily basis. Don't become complacent-find ways to      keep the beautiful and tasty treats going into the fall.      Plant a second crop of tomatoes in June to keep these      summer favorites available into the cooler months. Start      cool-season veggies like cabbage, collards, carrots and      cauliflower in July for a fantastic fall harvest. These      months are also a great time to pay some attention to your      favorite herbs. Harvest or pinch back the buds to encourage      some new growth. The flavor of some herbs will change if      they are allowed to flower. To dry herbs, simply tie small      bundles with rubber bands and hang in an airy spot until      leaves are crisp. (Finish in warm oven if weather is      humid.)    </p>    <h3>      Gulf Coast    </h3>    <p>      As heat-sensitive vegetables stop producing, consider      devoting some space to a green-manure cover crop. Southern      peas work especially well, since they add soil nitrogen,      suppress nematodes and still deliver a crop. Disease and      insect problems are at their peak when the heat is most      intense. Watch for problems and control them before they      spread: Remember the adage about the best safeguard being      the gardener's shadow. Pets such as aphids and white flies      can be controlled with a soap and oil solution of 2 1/2      tablespoons liquid dish soap and 2 1/2 tablespoons      vegetable oil to 1 gallon of water. Remember to test on a      small patch first for plant sensitivity and avoid spraying      during the heat of the day. By mid June it is time to start      seed for fall bell pepper and tomato transplants. Plant      palm trees now. In late July, start brassicas for the fall      garden.    </p>    <h3>      Central/Midwest    </h3>    <p>      Diligence pays off! You would be surprised at how      effectively hand-removal of pest insects and sick      vegetation prevents damaging infestations. Other defensive      measures include mulching to avoid soilborne diseases      spread by water splash, spacing plants for good air      circulation and watering early in the day-overnight      moisture provides a breeding ground for pests.    </p>    <p>      Weed regularly through July. Plant successive crops of      warm-season vegetables through early June, then switch to      cool-weather crops in July for a fall garden. Remember to      seed or plant some flowers. These will encourage bees and      other beneficials to visit, plus they're beautiful to have      in your garden.    </p>    <h3>      North Central and Rockies    </h3>        <p>      June means warm-season vegetables, including green beans,      corn, cucumber, pepper, squash and tomato. The production      of warm-season vegetables in climates where temperatures      can dip below freezing at any time requires constant      vigilance. If the plants freeze, they die. This requirement      has been relaxed somewhat with the advent of new protection      technologies. Spun-fiber row covers, insulating tipis and      automatically opening cold frames offer gardeners freedom      from having to stay close enough to their gardens to      prepare for unexpected cold weather, without the commitment      and expense of erecting a greenhouse. These products also      help hasten the harvest, especially in areas where cool      nighttime temperatures slow plant growth. Early July is      time to start many cool-season fall crops including kale.      In harsh, high-altitude gardens, kale is one of the most      dependable sources for vitamins and minerals. Frost      improves its rich flavor, and the tasty leaves can be      harvested fresh and green under winter snow.    </p>    <h3>      Pacific Northwest    </h3>    <p>      Warm-weather plants are in and established. Now is the      perfect time to take a break from weeding and start the      winter garden. In June and July? Yes, we are fortunate to      be able to reap a bounty of food all winter in this region,      but the key is starting seeds in summer. By choosing      varieties with different days-to-maturity ratings, you can      even harvest food in the fall, winter and early spring, all      from one seeding. (Just remember to add extra time to those      numbers to compensate for shorter days and slower growth in      the fall.) As a bonus, insects tend to leave winter gardens      alone, and there's no need to water once the rain starts.      Those are points to ponder in summer's heat and drought.      Most cool-weather crops are suitable, but check regional      seed catalogs for specific winter-garden varieties and      growing instructions.    </p>    <h3>      Southwest    </h3>    <p>      This time of year brings to mind the old song "Summertime"      (when the living is easy). Sweet corn, green beans and      peppers are starting to ripen. Mulch does double duty by      reducing weeding and conserving water-always a      consideration in this arid area. Sow a second crop of the      quick-maturing vegetables that love summer heat and a late      crop of sweet basil to put away as pesto for fall and      winter. The kids might like to try planting peanuts, which      need a lot of heat to grow. Luffa sponges are fun to plant      now, too, and by autumn you will have sponges that will      make your skin tingle!    </p>    <p>      Our thanks to the following for their contributions to the      Almanac: <strong>Roberta Bailey, FEDCO Seeds,</strong>      Waterville, Maine; <strong>Cricket Rakita, Southern      Exposure Seed Exchange</strong> , Mineral, Virginia;      <strong>Connie DamByl, William Dam Seeds,</strong> Dundas,      Ontario; <strong>Matt Barthel, Seed Savers      Exchange</strong> , Decorah, Iowa; <strong>Bill McDorman,      Seeds Trust/High Altitude Gardens,</strong> Hailey, Idaho;      <strong>Josh Kirschenbaum, Territorial Seed      Company</strong> , Cottage Grove, Oregon; <strong>Rose      Marie Nichols McGee, Nichols Garden Nursery</strong> ,      Albany, Oregon; <strong>Craig and Sue Dremann, Redwood City      Seed Co.</strong> , Redwood City, California; <strong>Dean      Lollis, Park Seed Co.</strong> , Greenwood, South Carolina.    </p>
