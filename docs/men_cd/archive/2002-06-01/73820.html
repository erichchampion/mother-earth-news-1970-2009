                    <h3>(or you can call them green soybeans) </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      by John Navazio: Photos by David Cavagnaro    </h5>        <p>It isn't often we discover a truly new      crop for our vegetable gardens. Asians have been enjoying      edamame ("ed-ah-mah-may"), sometimes called "green      vegetable soybeans," for many years. But this nutritious      and delicious crop is still unknown to most American      gardeners. As soon as you taste the sweet, nutty,      melt-in-your-mouth flavor of edamame, I predict you, too,      will become a devotee of this wholesome, easy-to-grow      vegetable.<br />  </p>    <p>      Edamame soybeans are different varieties than the types      grown as a dry field crop for making tofu, soybean oil or      other soy products. Edamame varieties are harvested while      they are still green, before the pods dry, much like      shelling peas. I first tried edamame at a Japanese      restaurant, where it was served as an appetizer in the      traditional style. The beans came to our table in a large      bowl, piping hot, looking exquisite in their emerald green      pods. I was with two Japanese friends, who taught me the      proper etiquette for eating edamame from the pod. They      showed me how to hold the pod lengthways near my lips and      then pinch the outer edge of the pod, pressing the beans      against the inner seam to split it so the beans popped      neatly into my mouth. Eating them from the shell in a      common bowl is a time-honored tradition that enhances the      pleasures of social interactions with friends. You can also      shell them before you serve them, or add them to stir-fry      or other dishes.    </p>    <p>      There's another excellent reason to give edamame a try this      summer. Many of us are eating more soy foods than ever      before as we learn about the health benefits of this      nutritious food. Aside from being a great source of quality      protein and vitamin E, soy foods contain isoflavones, which      seem to play a role in reducing the risk of heart attack,      osteoporosis, breast cancer and prostate cancer.    </p>        <h3>      GROWING GREEN BEANS    </h3>    <p>      Edamame does well in many different soil types, but make      sure the spot is well drained with plenty of mature compost      worked in. Soybeans are a warm-season crop, so plant the      seeds when it's time to transplant tomatoes, or when the      soil is at least 60 degrees. Sow eight to 10 seeds per foot      in the row, at a depth of 1 to 1 1/2 inches. Edamame plants      can get rather bushy, so space your rows at least 2 to 2      1/2 feet apart. All soybeans, including edamame, are      legumes that host beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria on      their roots. To take advantage of this natural nitrogen      production, you can dust your seeds before planting with a      bacterial inoculant for soybeans (available from most seed      catalogs that offer edamame.)<br />    </p>    <p>      Some Japanese farmers transplant this valuable crop from      the greenhouse. To do this, be sure to grow the seedlings      in separate pots and carefully transplant them after      hardening off the plants.    </p>    <p>      Make sure your edamame bed gets full sun and give the      plants the same amount of water you give peas or beans.      Once the plants start yielding harvestable pods, keep the      beans picked on schedule, not missing any. Remember the      plant's goal is to reproduce, and they won't continue      yielding if you allow them to make seed.    </p>    <h3>      WHEN DO YOU PICK?    </h3>    <p>      Harvesting edamame pods for fresh eating is like picking      peas for shelling. The first sign your crop is close to      harvest is the swelling of the pods. Once this starts it's      a good idea to check your plants every couple of days to      monitor their progress. This is important because they can      quickly over ripen and become starchy. When the beans are      fully formed and almost touching each other within the      pods, open a few of the plumpest pods to see if the beans      are fully formed, and taste a few of them raw. They should      be mildly sweet and tender without any starchiness.    </p>    <p>      Iowa gardener David Cavagnaro says, "There's a very narrow      harvest window, and you really have to pay attention to get      the maximum tenderness and sweetness from your crop." Never      let the pods turn yellow, a sure sign the beans inside are      getting starchy and past their prime.    </p>        <h3>      COOKING OR FREEZING YOUR CROP    </h3>    <p>      So now you've got a crop of edamame coming in, and you're      finding out just how many pods those couple of rows you      planted can produce. If there are more ripe pods than you      can use fresh, the best way to preserve them at their peak      of perfection is to freeze. Freezing edamame is almost as      easy as cooking them to eat on the spot. All you do is wash      them, then cook and freeze right in the pod.    </p>    <p>      For freezing, put the pods into lightly sated, boiling      water, aril instead of cooking them for five to six minutes      as you would when you plan to eat them fresh, reduce the      cooking time to three to four minutes. When they're done,      lift the pods from the boiling water and put them into a      basin of ice water. This will stop the cooking process.      Once all the pods are chilled, lift them from the water and      pat the excess water with a clean kitchen towel. Next place      them into plastic freezer bags, press the excess air out      and pop them into the freezer. When you want a taste of      summer, just take a bag out of the freezer, pour the      contents straight into a pot of boiling water and cook for      only two to three minutes.    </p>        <h3>      BEST VARIETIES FOR THE GARDEN    </h3>    <p>      To evaluate the edamame varieties now offered in seed      catalogs, I enlisted the help of two astute gardeners in      other parts of the country, gardener and photographer David      Cavagnaro in Decorah, Iowa, and C.R. Lawn, a seeds person      in Canaan, Maine, to augment my plantings in Bellingham,      Washington. Together we tested the same five varieties: two      stalwarts, 'Envy' and 'Butterbeans,' from Johnny's Selected      Seeds in Albion, Maine; two Japanese newcomers to the      United States, 'Sayamusume' and 'Misono Green,' from      Territorial Seeds in Cottage Grove, Oregon; and the variety      'Shirofumi' from Fedco Seeds in Waterville, Maine. The      three of us planted these five edamame varieties during the      last week of May in our respective locations, and we all      enjoyed enough warmth and sunshine to get our crops off to      a running start.    </p>    <p>      By the middle of August in Iowa and Maine, and early      September in Washington, we were all picking and grinning      as we discovered just how delicious homegrown edamame can      be. We all agreed a good edamame variety had to have a      sweet, buttery flavor with a tender, but slightly crunchy      texture. But there is another important attribute of good      flavor. C.R. Lawn summed it up best: "There's a nutty      flavor that I look for in edamame. It's the nuttiness that      gives body to the flavor."    </p>    <p>      For earliness, there were two clear winners, 'Envy' and      'Shirofumi.' For an early harvest, 'Shirofurni' had the      sweetest, most tender beans; it got rave reviews in all      locations. But 'Envy' shouldn't be counted out. 'Envy,'      which is touted as a first early variety, was easily 10      days earlier than 'Shirofumi' for me in cool, coastal      Washington State. In the hotter summers of Iowa and Maine      (yes, Maine can have hot weather!), it wasn't significantly      earlier than 'Shirofurmi.' While 'Envy' wasn't as sweet as      other edamame varieties, it did have a robust, nutty      flavor, which coupled with its earliness should earn it a      spot in any short-season garden.    </p>        <p>      'Sayamusume' received the real honors for flavor. It took a      little longer to mature but was well worth the wait.      'Sayamusume' was about a week later in maturity than the      other varieties in Iowa and Maine. Another edamame      connoisseur, Steve Peters of Seeds of Change in Santa Fe,      New Mexico, says, 'Sayamusume' is everything you want in      edamame: It's plump, tender, sweet, with a buttery flavor,      and it's consistent from pod to pod."    </p>    <p>      David Cavagnaro recognizes another plus for gardeners who      "shell out" their edamame for cooking: "Both 'Sayamusume'      and 'Shirofumi' have big pods with big seeds, which makes      then easier to shell than the other varieties."    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Edamame<br />      Seed sources    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Jhonny's Selected Seeds<br /></strong> (207)      437-4301 <em>www.johnnyseeds.com</em> 'Envy,' 'Butterbeans'    </p>    <p>      <strong>Territorial Seed Co.</strong><br />      (541) 942-9547 <em>www.territorialseed.com</em>      'Sayamusume,' 'Misono Green'    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fedco*</strong><br />      (207) 873-733 <em>www.fedcoseeds.com</em> 'Shirofumi'    </p>    <p>      *Fedco is the only U.S. supplier of "Shirofumi,' but its      deadline for 2002 orders has passed.    </p>		</div>        <p>      'Butterbeans' was the real surprise in this test. Since      'Butterbeans' is derived from a cross between an American      soybean and a Japanese edamarne, I suspected its flavor and      quality wouldn't match the other purebred edamame      varieties. However, it did well in all locations, with a      harvest window just behind 'Envy' and 'Shirofumi,' and a      buttery, sweet flavor almost as good as 'Shirofumi.'    </p>    <p>      'Misono Green' received less praise than the others, as its      flavor was on the bland side and it wasn't early. It did,      however, yield well, setting quite a few pods.    </p>    <h3>      GROWING FOR YOUR REGION    </h3>    <p>      Regionally, there were differences in these varieties'      reaction to the environment. 'Envy' and 'Butterbeans'      seemed to perform best in more northerly locations, with      'Envy' showing its early advantage in the cool coastal      Washington summer. In trials performed in New Mexico by      Seeds of Change. 'Envy' produced few harvestable pods and      had yellowing leaves on spindly plants. Jeff McCormick of      Garden Medicinals in Earlysville, Virginia, tried growing      'Butterbeans' a few years ago only to find an unappealing      discoloration of the beans in the green-shell stage.    </p>    <p>      Margaret Crow, a homesteader near Southwest Ranches,      Florida, plants her edamame in August or September for a      winter crop and has had great success with 'Butterbeans,'      demonstrating how a variety from another region can work if      planted at the right time of year. However, she also grows      'Envy' under this regimen and its yields are still poor.    </p>    <p>      As always, the best advice is to grow at least a couple of      different varieties in your garden and scrutinize the      results. Obviously, a variety like 'Sayamusume,' which      performed superbly in Maine, Iowa, Washington and New      Mexico, should do well in most locations.    </p>    <p>      When he's not snacking on edamame, independent plant      breeder John Navazio trains seed growers and develops      improved vegetable varieties for organic growing at his new      company, SEEDS (Sustainable Education for the Ethical      Development of Seeds), in Iowa City, Iowa.    </p>
