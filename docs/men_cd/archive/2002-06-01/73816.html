                    <h5>By Brook Elliot </h5>        <p>      <strong>Wow!" a recent visitor exclaimed. "Those are pretty      enough to grow in a flower garden." She was right. With its      elegant hibiscus-like flowers and spiky pods, okra is as      showy as any edible plant can be. The tall plants look      great in the garden, and the dried seed pods are often used      in floral arrangements. The young pods are the part you      eat; they have a tender, chewy texture and earthy green      taste.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Call it <em>gumbo, bamya, lady's fingers,</em> <em>bhindi,      quingombo</em> or a half-dozen other names, okra is an      annual vegetable usually thought of as a Southern plant.      Reflecting its host of common names, okra even has two      scientific names: Abelmoschus esculentus and Hibiscus      esculentus.    </p>    <p>      A basic ingredient in the Cajun dish fil√© gumbo,      okra is actually much more versatile. It can be breaded and      fried, steamed, baked, grilled, stir-fried, pickled, or      used in numerous soups and stews.    </p>    <p>      Originating in Africa, okra is thought to have been brought      to America by slaves, along with that other Southern      staple, cowpeas (aka black-eyed peas). In colonial days it      was more universally popular than now and was being sold in      Philadelphia markets as early as 1781. In his classic 1863      book, <em>Field and Garden Vegetables of America,</em>      Fearing Burr lists four varieties, which indicates okra was      a widespread market crop by the middle of the 19th century.      As recently as 1998, there were 43 varieties being offered      by commercial seed houses, according to the Seed Savers      Exchange's <em>Garden Seed Inventory.</em>    </p>    <p>      Depending on variety, okra grows from 2 feet to as much as      10 feet tall, and usually produces green pods and yellow      flowers with purple centers. But there are many variations      on this theme, including plants whose stems, foliage and      pods range from burgundy to scarlet. My favorite is an      heirloom variety called 'Betty's White,' which produces      ivory flowers with claret centers and white to very      pale-green pods.    </p>    <p>      As the plant matures, a single flower forms in the crotch      between branches and the stems of leaves. These flowers      last only one day and are immediately followed by pods.      Unharvested, the pods can grow as long as 10 inches. Okra      prefers hot weather, but it's a misconception that it      requires a very long growing season. Some varieties will      begin forming pods just 50 to 60 days after planting. If      your hot summer season is short, be sure to use one of      these early-yielding varieties, such as 'Annie Oakley,'      'Dwarf Green Long Pod,' 'Blondie,' 'Burgundy' or 'Clemson      Spineless.' Once the plants start setting pods, they will      continue doing so until frost.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Hot Pickled Okra    </h3>    <p>      3 1/2 pounds small okra pods    </p>    <p>      4 cloves garlic<br />      2 small hot peppers, halved<br />      3 cups water<br />      3 cups vinegar<br />      1/3 cup canning salt<br />      2 teaspoons dill seed    </p>    <p>      Pack okra firmly into four clean pint jars. Put a garlic      clove and half-pepper in each jar. Combine water, vinegar,      salt and dill. Bring to a boil. Pour hot liquid over okra,      leaving 1/4-inch head space. Remove air bubbles. Adjust      caps. Process 15 minutes in water bath.    </p>		</div>    <p>      Okra will grow in any well-drained garden soil in full sun.      The soil should be worked 8 to 10 inches deep to promote      strong root growth, and compost or organic fertilizer      should be worked in. Most okra growers sow seeds directly      in the garden. Plant the seeds an inch deep and 2 inches      apart, in rows 3 feet apart, a few weeks after all danger      of frost has passed. Once sprouted, the plants should be      thinned to about 15 inches. Alternatively, plant three to      five seeds in hills 15 inches apart. When the plants are 3      or 4 inches tall, thin the hills to the single strongest      plant in each hill.    </p>    <p>      Contrary to conventional wisdom, okra can be started      indoors. I start it in flats, then repot the young shoots      into newspaper pots. These in turn are transplanted after      all frost danger has passed, being careful to not disturb      the roots. Growers in short-season climes might consider      this technique to assure a crop.    </p>    <p>      Okra should be cultivated to keep weeds down. Hand pull any      weeds very close to the stems to avoid damaging roots. The      plants produce strong stems, and staking is usually not      needed. Okra is fairly drought tolerant, and watering every      seven to 10 days is more than adequate.    </p>    <h3>      HARVESTING AND PRESERVING    </h3>        <p>      Okra pods should be picked when they are 2 to 3 inches      long. (Larger pods will be tough and fibrous.) Often this      means harvesting every two days to assure tender pods. Some      okra varieties have short, hairy bristles that can cause      itchiness and a possible rash, so wear gloves when      harvesting the pods. (These hairs lose their prickliness      when cooked.) Pods keep well in the fridge for up to three      days. After that they start to discolor and deteriorate      rapidly.    </p>    <p>      Three to four plants produce more than enough okra for the      average family. Excess pods can be frozen, or you can make      okra pickles. (See "Hot Pickled Okra," at left) To freeze,      just blanch the whole pods in boiling water for three to      four minutes. then immediately cool them in an ice water      hath. Freeze them in plastic bags, squeezing out as much      air as possible before sealing.    </p>    		    <p>      To save seed from okra, let a few pods on each plant go      unharvested. They'll grow large, then start to dry. If      possible let them dry fully on the plants. If not, once the      drying has started, take them indoors and let them dry      thoroughly. Even fully mature green pods can be dried      indoors. The seeds shell easily from the dried pods.    </p>    <p>      Although okra flowers are perfect and self-pollinating, the      showy blooms are very attractive to bees, and different      varieties readily cross-pollinate. To guarantee seed      purity, varieties should be separated by at least one mile,      or other isolation techniques-such as bagging      individual flowers-should be used. When stored under      ideal conditions, okra seed will remain viable for about      five years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Okra</strong> <strong>Seed Sources:</strong> Park      Seed, (800) 845-3369, <em>www.park.seed.com</em> ; Southern      Exposure Seed Exchange, (540) 8949480,      <em>www.southernexposure.com</em> .    </p>
