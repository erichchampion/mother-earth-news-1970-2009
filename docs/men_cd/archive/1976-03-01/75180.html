                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Independence on a 5-Acre Farm    </h2>         <p>        Copyright © 1973 by John and Sally Seymour,        Introduction copyright © 1973 by Schocken Books,        Inc.      </p>      <p>        Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Two years ago, when there        were NO currently relevant small-scale-farming        introductory handbooks available, many of us welcomed the        publication of Richard Langer's Grow It! with open arms.        Now that we're all older and more experienced, however,        some folks find it increasingly easy to criticize that        breakthrough beginner's guide (see the <em>Feedback</em>        sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24 and 25).      </p>      <p>        Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is just        as important (probably more so) now as Grow It! was two        years ago . . . and which may well come up for its share        of criticism in another 24 months or so.<br />        <br />        Be that as it may, John and Sally Seymour's record of 18        successful years on a shirttail-sized homestead in        England is important now and should offer welcome        encouragement to today's back-to-the-landers . . . both        real and imaginary. I started serializing the book in my        No. 25 issue and I'm sure that many readers will want a        personal copy for their home libraries.-MOTHER.      </p>      <h3>        STORAGE OF VEGETABLES      </h3>      <p>        <em>It Is very hard to imagine, Indeed, what anyone        should want ice for, in a country like this, except for        clodpole boys to slide upon, and to drown cockneys In        skiting-time.</em>      </p>      <p><strong>        WILLIAM COBBETT      </strong></p>      <p>        From which remark one gathers that Cobbett would not have        been a great exponent of the deep freeze. We have a deep        freeze now, but personally I think it is a misuse of this        instrument to use it for the storage of vegetables. The        reason for this is that, in the British Isles at least,        it is possible to have good fresh vegetables from the        garden all the year round, and it is far better to "enjoy        the fruits of the earth in their season" than to try and        prolong the seasons of vegetables by freezing them into        some horrible mush in plastic bags in a freezer. The        reason why asparagus tastes so marvellous when you first        get your teeth into it late in April or early in May,        when you have just begun to get sick of spring cabbage,        is that you have not tasted it for eleven months. If you        had it every few days out of a deep freeze it would be        old hat-there would be no freshness about it. This        applies to peas, too, which I am told "freeze well";        fresh they are a great gastronomic experience (if they        are garden peas-not blue bullets from the greengrocers),        and it is a crime to keep nibbling peas all winter, thus        doing yourself out of the great treat of eating them in        the summer time when they come ripe as a fresh        experience. I am not talking about dried peas, which are        an entirely different kettle of fish.      </p>      <h3>        RUNNER BEANS      </h3>      <p>        People freeze runner beans. They are crazy in their        heads. I have eaten frozen runner beans and they are not        a patch on salted ones. Runner beans are things you can        quite justifiably store, because if you have planted them        properly you will have such a glut of them that you will        eventually get tired of them, and they store so cheaply        and easily. Pick them when they are young and green (not        old and stringy), slice them (we do it with a little bean        slicer that screws on the table), lay them in layers in a        big crock with 1 lb. salt to 3 lbs. beans and pack tight        to exclude air. When the crock is full cover it up. If        they go bad 'you have not put enough salt in them. When        you want runner beans, some time in the winter when the        weather is foul and you don't feel like going out into        the snow to pick Brussels sprouts, pull a handful out of        the salt, wash under the tap for an hour and then boil.        You can hardly tell the difference between salted runners        and fresh. I know this goes against the "fruits of the        earth in their season" philosophy, but I think an        exception should be made in the case of runner beans. It        is good always to have some green vegetables available no        matter what the weather.      </p>      <h3>        ROOT VEGETABLES      </h3>      <p>        Root vegetables of course should be stored, for the idea        of the swollen root (or stem as it is in some cases) is        just that-to store the summer's goodness for the        winter time. We have discussed clamping under potatoes,        but I will recapitulate it here. Pile any root vegetable        in a long pyramidal heap, cover the heap well with straw        or bracken (a foot thick at least), cover that with earth        which you pat on hard with a spade. Leave straw sticking        out at the bottom about every two yards to let air in,        and little straw chimneys sticking out of the ridge at        the top every two yards to let the air out. Most roots        don't like frost, and the clamp protects them from it. If        you have a good dry root cellar, or really frost-proof        outbuilding, you might use them instead: less work than        clamping. Potatoes don't like light (it makes them green        and inedible). Parsnips don't mind frost-in fact        they taste better after having been frosted: leave them        out where they grow and dig them as you want them. A        disadvantage of the root cellar or indoor store is that        you can get a build-up, after a year or two, of spores        which attack the roots you keep there. Clamps avoid this        trouble, and personally I prefer them.      </p>      <h3>        DRIED PEAS, BEANS OR PULSES      </h3>            <p>        These must be properly harvested. They must be allowed to        ripen absolutely in the haulm, gently pulled, left in the        sun and wind for some time, turned occasionally, then, if        you have the room, hung up in bunches from the roof of a        shed. If you don't have room like this to spare, and have        a lot of peas or beans, make a rick of them and keep the        rain out. Thresh with a flail and keep in dry bins or        crocks. Soak for at least twelve hours before cooking,        and add a little milk to the water when boiling.      </p>      <h3>        ONIONS      </h3>      <p>        Onions should also be properly harvested. When they are        quite ripe it is a good plan to bend their tops over for        a week or so. Then lift them out of the ground and lay        them on their sides, bottoms to the sun, for a week or        two, turning them occasionally. The best way to store        them is to hang them in strings, which is quite simple        just hang four strands of bailer or binder twine down        from a hook, and plait the short tops you have left on        your onions in to the strings-weave them in like        the warp and weft of a cloth. Nothing looks nicer than a        dozen or so fat strings of onions hung under the eaves of        your house on the southern side, or else hung in an airy        shed, or a big kitchen. To pickle onions: soak in brine        for three days, wash, dry and put in boiling vinegar.      </p>      <h3>        CELERY      </h3>      <p>        Celery is better when it's had a frost on it, and is that        valuable thing-a winter fresh vegetable. Leave it        in the garden, well earthed up, and eat it sparingly.        Like peas and Brussels sprouts you will never have        enough. In very severe weather cover the rows with straw        or bracken.      </p>      <h3>        TOMATOES      </h3>      <p>        Tomatoes can be bottled when ripe, made into chutney        green, or each one wrapped separately in tissue paper and        put in a drawer. Some can be laid, green, on a        window-sill to ripen, but they'll probably go rotten like        this. We used to lay them in draper's wadding, in        drawers, not touching each other. If you live in a hot        country, like Spain, you can hang them, ripe, in bunches        in the sun. They'll shrivel up and keep good. I think we        should experiment in England with doing the same thing        with artificial heat. Spanish dried tomatoes have a        marvellous flavour. When picking tomatoes for dry-storing        leave the stems on and do not bruise. To bottle tomatoes,        wash in cold water, place in bottles, fill bottle with        brine made with 1/2 oz. salt to 1 quart water. Put the        screwtops on the bottles but do not screw them tight        because, obviously, the steam must escape or the bottles        will burst. Place the bottles in a large kettle of cold        water, with the water covering the tops, and bring slowly        to 190° F. (88° C.) Keep it there for half an        hour. Remove bottles from water and screw tops tight        immediately. Another way is to scald the tomatoes first        in boiling water for ten seconds, pull them out and drop        them in cold water then you can remove the skins. Pack        the fruit tightly into the jars with no added liquid, but        if you add a teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful        of sugar to each pound of fruit it is said to improve the        flavour. Then heat an sea[ the jars as for tomatoes in        brine.      </p>      <h3>        BOTTLING      </h3>      <p>        I will here say a word or two about bottling in general.        We have always used kilner jars, which are proprietory        jars with screw tops holding down a glass disk on a        rubber ring. The rubber rings need renewing occasionally        (every few years-or as soon as they stretch) and        the metal parts of the tops should be well rubbed with        vaseline before you use them, otherwise they will rust.        Store rubber in the dark. There are other proprietory        bottling jars: they all have one thing in common: they        cost money. Our forebears used to preserve things by        putting them in stoneware jars, or pottery jars, or old        glass jars, sterilizing by boiling as we do, then sealing        by running hot fat, hot wax or other air-excluding        substance over the material to be bottled. The principle        of bottling is simply this. You destroy all the        micro-organisms which might cause decay by heating them,        while the material is still sterile; then you seal it        from the air so that no more micro-organisms can get in.        Canning is the modern industrialized way of doing the        same thing.      </p>      <p>        For bottling it is very good to have a bottling boiler,        which has a false bottom to stop the glass jars from        standing directly over the source of the heat, and a hole        in the lid for a thermometer. You can buy a special        bottling thermometer. If you haven't got a thermometer        you can achieve the same result by filling your bottles        with hot syrup or brine, plunging them into hot water,        heating until the water is simmering and keeping it        simmering for half an hour. The idea, though, of the        thermometer method is so that you do not have to heat the        stuff you are bottling more than absolutely necessary to        sterilize it, for over-heating kills the flavour, and,        with that, the vitamins. If you haven't got a bottling        boiler any old receptacle will do, provided that it is        deep enough for you to be able to stand the bottles on a        metal plate or grid or something (even a thick cloth)        just to keep their bottoms from touching the source of        heat.<br />      </p>      <p>        If you grow outdoor tomatoes most of them won't get ripe.        Such of these, as are not blighted, as you don't think        will ripen in drawers, make chutney of:      </p>      <p>        Take 1 lb. of green tomatoes, cut them up; chop up half a        pound of onions, put in 1 oz. of salt, 2 teaspoons of        cayenne pepper, 1-1/4 pints of vinegar, 3/4 lb. brown        sugar or honey, 1/2 lb. raisins; simmer in a saucepan        until it goes thick. Bottle hot in hot sterilized jars,        and you don't need to heat the jars again . Don't cover        with metal covers or the vinegar will eat the metal.        Greaseproof paper is good enough to cover chutney, like        jam.      </p>      <p>        It is well worth going to some trouble to preserve        tomatoes. If you can grow a few tomato plants in the        greenhouse, and some out of doors, you will have fresh        tomatoes for a good many months of the summer and autumn,        but after this you must have them preserved. Tomatoes        make all the difference to good cooking, and, further,        they are the third richest source of vitamin C that we        have available (black currant being the highest, lemon        next).      </p>      <p>        Another use for surplus tomatoes is tomato juice. To make        this you simmer the tomatoes and then rub the pulp of        them through a fine sieve. Add to it 1/2 pint water, 1        oz. sugar, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1/2 teaspoonful pepper.        Bring to boil immediately (you must not leave it in the        air or it will go brown), pour into hot bottles, stand        for ten minutes in boiling water and seal.      </p>      <h3>        FRUITS      </h3>            <p>        Other things well worth bottling, particularly if you        have children in your community, include blackcurrants,        blackberries, raspberries and their kin, gooseberries.        Put into bottles, fill bottles with a syrup of 8 oz.        sugar to 1 pint water, boiled and then cooled, put on        caps lightly, place bottles in bottling boiler, fill with        cold water over the tops of the bottles, bring slowly to        165° F. (74° C.) and keep there for ten minutes.        Haul the bottles out and tighten tops hard immediately.        And here is a tip about tightening tops of bottles. After        the bottles have cooled, unscrew the metal tops and pick        the bottles up by the glass discs. If there is a proper        seal there will be a vacuum inside and you can do this.        If the glass tops come off then you must boil and seal        again-you haven't got an airtight seal. After        testing, if successful, replace the metal screw-top and        screw on hard. Shove the bottle in a shelf and forget it        until the darkness of the winter. It is very satisfying        to walk into your larder and see shelf after shelf of        bottled fruit in the early part of the winter:        particularly if you know you have got a Jersey cow or two        to milk and will have plenty of rich cream to go with        it.<br />      </p>      <p>        Soft fruit freezes quite well, and if you have a deep        freeze you will probably find yourself using it to        preserve your soft fruit and not going to the trouble of        bottling. Pack in polythene bags of course.      </p>      <p>        People bottle all sorts of other things, like apples, but        personally I think it is a waste of time.<br />      </p>      <p>        Apples, if they are keepers, should be laid out on clean        shelves (no spores from last year's fungus to decay        them), on paper if you like, not touching each other, in        an even temperature well above freezing and with        ventilation. They should thus keep the winter through. If        you have doubts about them dry some apple rings. Slice        your apples into discs, core them and thread them on a        string, dry them at from 120° to 150° F. (50°        to 65° C.) for five hours, hang them in the cool for        twelve hours, then pack in cardboard boxes and store in a        dry place. If you don't want them to go brown put in the        fumes of burning sulphur for ten minutes before you dry        them.      </p>      <p>        Pears can be quartered and put in brine of 1 oz. salt to        1 gallon water for a minute (this stops them        discoloring-you can't use sulphur with pears because it        spoils the flavour). Dry the quarters on trays starting        at 100° F. (38° C.) raising to 150° F.        (66° C.) for five hours.<br />      </p>      <p>        Prunes can be made of any plum or damson, and they are a        rich source of vitamin A. Dip the plums into a lye made        of I oz. caustic soda in a gallon of water for a few        minutes. This softens the skins. Wash very well in cold        water, dry on trays over your stove at 120° F.        (50° C.) raising to 160° F. (71° C.) very        gradually or the plums will burst. Keep in heat for two        days. Soak prunes in water for 12 hours before using.      </p>      <p>        Any fruit juice can be made (if you have small babies to        think about) by boiling fruit for half an hour, then        strain juice through strainer, let it stand for a day,        boil it for half an hour again, skim, add 1 lb. sugar per        gallon of juice, boil again, skim again, pour hot into        hot sterile bottles, stand bottles in boiling water for        ten minutes, seal. Blackcurrant is very good like this.      </p>      <h3>        MUSHROOMS      </h3>      <p>        Mushrooms are marvellous dried. Thread on strings and        hang over stove, 120° F. (50° C.) is right, until        dry. They are best crumbled up to a, powder and stored in        airtight jars or cans. Marvellous for flavouring soups or        stews.      </p>      <p>        All herbs can be dried. Pick just before they flower and        hang in bunches near your stove.      </p>      <h3>        CHUTNEYS      </h3>      <p>        Chutneys can be made of nearly anything. The principle is        simmer your fruit or vegetable together with onions and        spices (the more spices the merrier in my opinion and        onions are essential) in vinegar. When it has boiled down        to a thick goo bottle and cover with greaseproof paper.        You don't need recipes of 2/3 oz. of this and 3/4 oz. of        that if you just use common sense. Of course you need        salt and pepper.      </p>      <h3>        PICKLING      </h3>            <p>        To pickle anything cut it up, lay it in salt for a day,        rinse and cover with cold vinegar. Gherkins are well        worth pickling. Leave these in a brine of 1 lb. salt to 1        gallon of water for at least three days (weeks if you        like), pull them out of the brine and drain, pour hot        spiced vinegar over them, cover and leave for 24 hours,        drain vinegar off, boil it again and pour it over the        gherkins. Do this twice if you like-it improves the        colour. Bottle and store.      </p>      <p>        To pickle onions leave in brine of 1 lb. salt to 1 gallon        water (don't skin the onions first) for at least 24 hours        months if you like-the longer the better. Drain, put in        jars, fill with cold spiced vinegar.      </p>      <h3>FREEZING OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES</h3>      <p>        You can freeze tomato juice or other fruit juice by        pouring it into cartons, putting it in the freezer until        solid, taking out of the cartons as small blocks of ice,        putting in plastic bags and back into the freezer.      </p>            <p>        All vegetables, if you must freeze them, plunge into        boiling water first, bring the water back to boil and        boil for three minutes, plunge into cold water, drain,        pack in plastic bags, seal bags, label, and freeze.      </p>      <p>        Soft fruit you can put straight into plastic bags, seal,        freeze; except gooseberries, which you should crush,        sprinkle with 1 lb. sugar to 3 lbs. fruit, bag and        freeze.      </p>      <h3>        SAUERKRAUT      </h3>      <p>        If you live in a land where no greens grow in the winter        time because it is deep in snow, make sauerkraut. This is        done by fermenting shredded cabbage sprinkled with salt        in deep bins until you want it, which is done this        way:<br />      </p>      <p>        Rub clean the inside of a wooden tub (crock would do)        with vinegar. Line it with cabbage leaves. Shred 12 lbs.        cabage, mix with 8 oz. salt, pack in tight, cover with        whole cabbage leaves, stir occasionally for first three        weeks and then leave covered until you want it. To cook        it, drain, put in boiling water and boil for 2 hours.      </p>      <h3>        SWEET CORN      </h3>      <p>        Sweet corn: boil well on the cob, dry cobs in slow oven        overnight, break kernels off cob, store in closed jars.        Sweet corn will freeze well too-take it off the cob        of course and stow in bags.      </p>      <p>        We lived for eight years in Suffolk without a deep        freeze, and we lived very well indeed. We hardly ever        bought any food and we never felt the lack of anything.        We bottled a lot, made jam a lot, dried a lot. We were        never short of vegetables nor of fruit. The only        difference now that we have got a deep freeze, as far as        vegetables and fruit are concerned, is that we freeze        soft fruit and fruit juice and don't bottle them. I have        a feeling that they were nicer when we bottled them.      </p>
