                        <p>      January 27, 1976 was a momentous day in history for the      staff here at THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) ... because at      around two in the afternoon, the heat came on in our      editorial offices. Not just any heat, mind you. Solar heat.    </p>    <p>      A thick cloud cover and day-long drizzle kept the outside      temperature that afternoon to a -mere 40 degrees Fahrenheit      ... yet enough thermal energy had accumulated in our      system's water storage tanks to provide honest-to-goodness      warmth for 1,600 square feet of office space. It was enough      to make a natural gas salesman cry.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's experiment in solar heating began last July, when      four Georgia Tech students made some preliminary      calculations that led to the design and construction of the      30 solar collectors that presently adorn MOTHER's roof. By      the following season, other talented folks-such as      engineer Joe Lane, carpenter Bob Pace, and all-'round handy      guy Dennis Burkholder-were brought in on the project,      and to ensure the success of MOTHER's efforts, a      Jacksonville, Florida engineering firm was eventually      retained for consultation.    </p>    <p>      The upshot of seven months' hard work-and many weeks      of waiting for parts-is that MOTHER now has: [1] 30      collectors, each measuring three feet by eight feet, facing      magnetic south on the roof, [2] four 550-gallon water      storage tanks in the basement which are maintained at 110      degrees or more whenever the system is in daytime      operation, and [3] plumbing connecting collectors, tanks,      and the forced-air heating ducts that lead to the      magazine's editorial department.    </p>    <p>      We won't go into a long, detailed explanation here of just      how the system functions- <em>that</em> you can read      in the very next issue of MOTHER, we promise-but we      <em>do</em> want our readers to know that the system is      completed and really works.    </p>    <p>      Now MOTHER (like so many homes and businesses these days)      is on her way to being less dependent on outside sources of      energy . . . sources which are, at best, destined to be a      mere "flash" in history's pan when compared to Ole Sol's      steady blaze.-KT.    </p>
