                    <h5 id="byline">      by BETH JACOBS    </h5>        <p>      <strong>Does the idea of having your very own auto wrecking      business turn you off? If so-and ladies, please pay      particular attention! - you'll want to learn why a      45-year-old California woman with three children became an      authority on Detroit's old clunkers . . . and how she uses      her knowledge to turn piles of "junk" into heaps of $$$.      Nope, there aren't any tricks involved, and you don't even      have to be a mechanic to duplicate her success.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Four years ago, when I was 45, my husband left me with      three children . . . and the beginnings of a wrecking yard.      At the time I hardly knew an automobile starter from a      generator (let alone whether any particular part was Ford,      General Motors, or Chrysler). Nor was I especially fond of      my business address: a short, unpaved, muddy, rutted lane      that dead-ended at a sewer plant and a hog farm and      which-ironically enough-was named Eden Road.    </p>    <p>      Today BJ's Auto Wreckers inventories 100 old cars on a      quarter acre of land and the enterprise is thriving so      vigorously that I now call the lane my "Garden of Eden      Road".    </p>    <p>      What's more, if I (a mere woman) can successfully operate a      wrecking yard-and make $1,000 a month doing      it-you can too. All you'll really need is a hunk of      ground on the outskirts of what currently passes for      civilization, and a bare minimum of mechanical ability. Add      the first to the second, throw in about $2,500 for the used      salvage equipment described in this article, top with a few      dollars of working capital . . . and you'll be ready to      start recycling America's Number One Product: The      Automobile.    </p>    <p>      And, although not everyone sees it this way, I believe that      mine is a worthy calling in the present age of economy and      ecology. By recycling parts from old junkers that have      already expired into younger junkers that are still      running, I know that I'm both [1] helping other people      stretch limited dollars and [2] somewhat lessening our      society's need for the copper, steel, aluminum, etc., that      goes into new cars. To think that I'm paid well for doing      such meritorious work!    </p>    <h3>      BUT FIRST, THE RED TAPE!    </h3>    <p>      If you'd like to give my calling a try, don't-for      gosh's sake-shout your intentions to the world . . .      not, at least, until you've planned your strategy for doing      battle with the various governmental agencies that issue      the multitude of permits you'll need. Auto salvage yards      are as necessary in our country as sunshine is to the      nation's crops . . . but authorities balk at issuing a new      wrecking yard permit until its prospective owner has jumped      through more than his or her share of hoops.    </p>    <p>      Start by checking your local municipal zoning code to      determine whether or not an "auto junkyard" is a permitted      use of Your property. If your town has no such ordinances      or an ordinance which carries no restrictions against this      use, you've cleared your first hurdle. <em>(A note of      caution: Salvage yards are generally prohibited by most      urban and suburban codes or, if allowed, are frequently      heavily restricted and regulated. Careful investigation at      this point in the founding of your new business can save      you time and money later. If you start the salvage      operation without proper zoning clearance, you could soon      find yourself defending a municipal court action or forced      to seek a variance-which you might not      receive-in the zoning code. Either course of action      could be expensive and time consuming.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Once you're squared away with your city (probably by      promising that your operation eventually will be screened      quite discreetly by a solid, ten-foot-high fence), you'll      be ready tot contact the appropriate state authorities. Try      to learn exactly whom to approach, how to go about it,      etc., from another auto wrecker in your state before you      begin. If no one will help you, though, the Department of      Motor Vehicles is a good place to start.<br />    </p>    <p>      Here in California, all salvage yards are licensed to      disassemble old automobiles by the Department of Motor      Vehicles. I'm also required to send a notice of acquisition      to the D.M.V. within 72 hours every time I acquire a      vehicle. (One copy of this notice goes to the highway      patrol and another to the justice department to notify      their computer systems that the car or truck in question is      off the road.) In most cases, I'm home free of additional      red tape on that particular vehicle as I strip it and sell      the individual parts to a number of customers over the next      few years. In the rare cases when I sell the whole car or      truck, however, the deal must be accompanied by some      paperwork run through D.M.V. which identifies the vehicle      as "reclaimed junk". (This involves various official      inspections and certificates.)    </p>    <p>      If this all sounds like too much trouble, please bear in      mind that California (where I operate) and Nevada probably      have the stiffest D.M.V. laws in the country. Missouri,      Iowa, and Illinois for instance-do not require      acquisition notices at all, although they do expect a      salvage yard to keep on file signed ownership certificates      or bills of sale for all vehicles in stock. As far as I      know, any state you live in will require you to have a      D.M.V. dismantler's license . . . but, from there, every      state has its own way of doing business. Don't guess about      yours. Get the straight dope from the proper      authorities.<br />    </p>    <p>      And don't let the "paperwork blizzard" I've just described      get you down. Once you've shoveled through this initial      snowbank of rules and regulations, the rest-setting      up a profitable auto recycling yard on a relatively small      amount of capital-is easy.    </p>    <h3>      FINANCING: WHERE WILL THE START-UP DOLLARS COME FROM?    </h3>    <p>      It's not easy to get bank financing for a salvage yard. At      least it wasn't for me. I asked for minority business loan      privileges as a lady wrecker . . . and was refused. So I      borrowed a small grubstake from a relative, bought a few      junked cars, towed in some freebies, sold some parts,      acquired more cars, and was soon on my way. True grit and      determination are probably the most important "financial"      capital you can have.    </p>    <h3>      QUALIFIED HELP . . . OR GROW-YOUR-OWN LABOR?    </h3>    <p>      The funds my children and I had in the beginning were so      meager that there was never any question of hiring      "qualified" help to assist us in the operation of our yard.      We just pitched in and did everything ourselves.    </p>    <p>      The kids have been great, even though mechanics and auto      wrecking have never been especially interesting to any of      them. The boys work before and after school towing in      wrecks, taking off parts, cutting up junkers, and loading      scrap iron. Even Suzanne, who has another job, works behind      the counter on Saturdays. Pulling together this way, the      family made a good living last year. I see no reason why      yours couldn't do the same.    </p>    <h3>      THE INDISPENSABLE GUIDE    </h3>    <p>      I consider the <em>Hollander Parts Interchange</em>      absolutely mandatory for anyone trying to make a living in      the auto salvage business. This series of reference books      lists the parts from one car-engine, brake drums,      springs, axles, drive lines, etc.-that will fit      another model of the same-or, in some cases, a      different brand of automobile. The used battery you have in      stock may not be from exactly the same make and model of      vehicle that your potential customer owns, in other words,      but you can still make a sale if you know that it'll fit      the car in need. Each volume in this invaluable series      covers a ten-year period and is available for about $46.00      from Hollander, P.O. Box 272, Eldon, Missouri 65026.    </p>    <h3>      EQUIPMENT: YOU WON'T NEED A LOT    </h3>    <p>      [1] A tow truck, of course, is absolutely essential for      hauling in the clunkers that will be your stock in trade.      The ideal is a brand-new factory-built job . . . say a 440      Holmes with single boom crane, tow sling, front push      bumper, dolly set, full light package, jumper box, vacuum      brake lock, and tow adapter for the newer cars that have      fiberglass front ends. Such a rig-from Fruehauf, Holmes, or      Weld-Built also costs a minimum of $4,100, which was      entirely out of our reach. So we did what a lot of the      operators of smaller junkyards do: We cobbled together a      tow truck. And so can you.    </p>    <p>      Take an old three-quarter-ton or a ton truck with dual rear      wheels and mount an A-frame, power winch, power takeoff,      cables, and safety straps on its back. A look around almost      any wrecking yard will turn up one or two similar homemade      beauties and give you all the ideas you'll need for      designing your own.<br />    </p>    <p>      [2] It's also hard to run a salvage yard without a loader      or boom truck. This is simply the big brother of the tow      truck-built on a short wheelbase-with an      extended (upward) A-frame for its hoist. The rig is used in      the yard to lift engines out of junkers and move otherwise      immobile car bodies from one spot to another.    </p>    <p>      Some wreckers keep an old forklift around as their boom      truck . . . which is OK if the machine is capable of      raising five tons to a height of 16 feet, is maneuverable      in a small space, and is kept on level and solid terrain.      Sink one of those babies in the mud, though, and it'll stay      there until spring. (Forklifts <em>are</em> available at a      reasonable price, however. I scouted government and private      heavy equipment liquidation sales and found several      suitable for junkyard work starting as low as $2,500.)    </p>    <p>      We inherited our loader from an old-time junkie and it can      best be described as "jerry-built". The winch, at the time      we got the highly modified Chevy truck, was raised and      lowered by the low and reverse gears of an old Rambler      automobile transmission . . . which vibrated so much that      it split its case once a month. As soon as we could get      enough working capital together, we had a heavy equipment      repair shop replace the defective unit with a surplus power      winch.<br />    </p>    <p>      We also had to reanchor the whole boom assembly to the old      truck once after trying to lift a '56 Caddie in the yard.      During that abortive attempt, the heavy diamond-plated      steel rear decking of the boom peeled off like a sardine      can lid and the A-frame crashed into the loader's cab. We      now have extra safety cables on this "workhorse" and warily      regard the boom truck as the "wild stallion" we know it can      be.    </p>    <p>      [3] A cutting or burning torch-for hacking car bodies      into scrap or reaching parts made inaccessible by an      accident-is another mandatory piece of salvage yard      equipment. You can operate yours on either oxygen-acetylene      or oxygen-propane (whichever is less expensive in your      area) . . . but I do suggest 50 feet of hose and portable      bottles. For even greater mobility, attach the cutting      tanks to the side of your loader's boom or mount them in      any old car that you can drive right up to the jobs you      want to do.    </p>    <p>      [4] You'll also need a certain amount of mechanic's tools,      although there's no need to go overboard here. Either of my      sons can remove just about any American car part with what      he carries in his hip pockets: two screwdrivers, a ratchet      handle, an extension for the ratchet, a nine-sixteenths and      a half-inch socket, and a pair of slipjoint pliers.      Additional odds and ends can include a battery charger,      floor jack, welder, compressor, a few power tools . . .      make up your own list.<br />    </p>    <p>      My personal opinion is that-unless your local zoning      ordinance absolutely forces you to, erect that solid,      ten-foot-high fence I mentioned earlier-you should be      able to completely assemble all the tools and equipment      you'll need (if, that is, you build rather than buy the tow      and boom trucks) for the $2,500 that a used forklift alone      can cost. I speak from experience.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO FIND YOUR ORIGINAL "MERCHANDISE"    </h3>    <p>      If you're-like many modern American families, you already      have the seeds-a couple of wheezing or completely      inoperative jalopies-for a salvage yard sitting out      behind the house someplace. And if you don't, a sizable      number of people in your town do. Ask around. I'd always      heard that the big male topic of conversation at the local      pubs and garages was sex but, since becoming a lady      wrecker, I know better: It's cars! Mention that you're      starting a wrecking business, and folks will tell you where      to find an incredible number of junks. All yours for the      hauling. Granted, you can't be choosy on these deals . . .      but they'll sustain you until you have a grubstake and know      what you can sell.    </p>    <h3>      LATER (AND GREATER) ACQUISITIONS    </h3>    <p>      As you build your business, your clientele's needs and      wants will guide the selection of your purchases. BJ's, for      instance, borders East Oakland and my customers are poorer      people trying to keep their old second and third hand      chariots together. I deal in older cars, then, for very      good reasons.<br />    </p>    <p>      Many of the clunkers I tow in are abandoned in Alameda (a      Navy town) by sailors who buy ancient junkers, drive 'em      while in port . . . and then sometimes just leave the      vehicles on the street when they ship out. If such an owner      abandons a car in this manner, I frequently do the      necessary paperwork for a lien sale (if the jalopy is worth      more than $200) or secure a police bill of sale (if the      heap's value is estimated at less than two bills).    </p>    <p>      Most late model and near-new wrecks are bought by salvage      yards through bids to insurance companies.      <em>Occasionally,</em> I'll spring for one of these deals      to fill a particular customer order. Generally, however, I      can't afford to tie up that much money in a single      automobile.    </p>    <p>      The wreckers who go for these later model, big buck deals      usually tell me that it doesn't pay to fool with the old      clunkers I handle, since it takes just as much labor to      remove a '58 Buick fender and sell it for $15.00 as it does      to make the same transaction on a '75 for four times that      amount. Maybe so. But the guys who talk like that usually      have more operating capital than I do and one or more      full-time mechanics on the payroll. By keeping my overhead      down, I net enough on the $15.00 deals to make it worth my      while . . . and I don't have $50,000 or $100,000 tied up to      do it.<br />    </p>    <p>      Besides, I'm assuming that any MOTHER reader interested in      setting up a salvage yard will probably be forced by      circumstances (a tight budget) to go about it somewhat the      way I did. I'm also assuming that the typical reader of      this magazine would prefer to deal with my kind of small      family business . . . or with the little wrecker outside      Paris, Idaho (where we once got an emergency water pump for      our old Ford) . . . or with the tiny yard in Crescent,      Oregon (that happened to have an axle for my '59 Chevy when      I needed it most).    </p>    <p>      These operations are more like Red Cross rescue units than      wrecking yards. They gather up the countryside's junkers      and enclose them in fenced areas behind small garages . . .      where a fellow native can come in with his own tools and      get the engine, transmission, rear end, or axle he needs.      Then, when a traveler breaks down in their territory, the      wreckers dispatch their tow trucks and bring in the      distressed. Sometimes they have just the part the wayfarer      needs and he or she is soon on his or her way again.      Occasionally the dealer patches up one of his "better" cars      and trades it for the disabled vehicle plus a little cash.      At worst, the stranded motorist spends a day or two in the      shade of the garage while his or her machine's missing part      is sent in from the outside world. I tell you, I can grow      absolutely lyrical about the contributions that      family-owned and -operated salvage yards make to our      society!    </p>    <h3>      BRANCHING OUT IS POSSIBLE    </h3>    <p>      You might find it both interesting and profitable to expand      your operation to handle farm machinery. On a cross-country      trip I made through Texas and Colorado in 1973, in fact, I      saw the hulks of tractors, combines, and cultivators mixed      in with the automobiles and trucks in a number of wrecking      yards. Collecting and recycling such equipment could be a      valuable service for back-to-the-landers and homesteaders      in your area. <em>(I know of several salvage yards in      Indiana and other farming states that handle nothing but      tractors, combines, etc.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <h3>      AND DON'T FORGET YOUR OTHER SOURCES OF CASH!    </h3>    <p>      Of course, no matter how narrow or wide a field you decide      to serve, the recycled parts and occasional complete      vehicle you sell should never account for all the money you      take in. You'll also have out and out salvage to sell too.      I've received $35.00 a ton for car bodies delivered to      Pacific State Steel Mill . . . and I didn't even have to      strip off the upholstery (only remove the tires, including      spare, and cut the straps on the gas tank) to get it. The      price for bodies, as well as Number One and Number Two      scrap iron fluctuates monthly, as you might have imagined,      and the smart dealers stockpile during times of low rates      and sell when the offers are high.    </p>    <p>      There are also dollars in non-ferrous items. I know one      old-time junkman who carries a magnet in his pocket and      whose "gold" is everything the magnet <em>won't</em> pick      up: pot metal such as car door handles, lead from      batteries, aluminum, brass, and copper. (When copper sold      for 68 cents a pound a few months ago, we had to padlock      our scrap radiators at night to protect them from      thieves.)<br />    </p>    <p>      Then again, the biggest fortune of all is still waiting to      be made in the junk business: Just discover a way to      recycle rubber tires (they don't rust or decompose) and      you'll be set for life. Despite the experiments now taking      place in which the old casings are shredded up for road      paving, nobody has yet devised the way to get rid of North      America's millions upon millions of discarded tires. I pay      25 cents each to have mine hauled to a dump . . . and they      aren't wanted even there.    </p>    <h3>      A FINAL WORD ON PRICING    </h3>    <p>      Used auto, truck, and other parts sell for various figures      in various parts of the country. Prices can even span a      considerable range for the same item from one dealer to      another operating out of the same town. This is because no      two salvage yards have the same land, equipment, labor, and      other factors to calculate into their overhead. No two      yards do the same amount of business, compete for exactly      the same market, specialize in the same selection of parts,      or have the same amount and variety of stock on hand. About      the only ironclad rule I can give you is that, in general,      rural operators almost always have lower overhead and      charge less-part for part-than their urban      counterparts.    </p>    <p>      Whenever I'm setting a price for an item, I personally put      the most weight on only two factors: [1] what I paid for      the part or the wreck it came out of and [2] what the      demand for the piece happens to be at the time. Although I      do find myself haggling over price on occasion, my "feel"      for the business generally makes the figure I ask stick the      first time I ask it.<br />    </p>    <p>      In the last analysis, of course, this "feel"-which I      can't really teach you in an article-is your most      important stock in trade. Learn or develop it as rapidly as      you can. You'll never really know how much you can afford      to pay for a wreck until you have a good idea of how many      of its parts you can sell and what price you'lI get for      them.    </p>    <h3>      AND A FINAL, FINAL WORD    </h3>    <p>      This has been only a spit-in-the-eye account of how almost      anyone in the United States can set up and operate an      automobile salvage yard. I didn't tell you about the seven      days a week of the hardest damned work you can imagine . .      . or the greasy, busted knuckles you'll get removing a      transmission . . . or the customer who trades one old part      for another and expects a new car guarantee.<br />    </p>    <p>      Nor did I mention the Auto Wrecking Gods . . . who      advertise acres and acres of late model cars and million      dollar inventories . . . who have special jitneys for      hauling customers out to see parts . . . and whose offices      are equipped with special hotlines to other dealers just in      case you need a part that the yard you visited doesn't have      in stock. That's not what this article has been about.    </p>    <p>      This article is simply my testimonial that      anyone-even a gal with three children and no      husband-can still start an auto wrecking business,      one of the last unfranchised enterprises left in America,      on little more than desperation and raw guts. And can, if      he (or she) doesn't mind working and skinning his (or her)      knuckles to the bone, make a decent living ($1,000 a      month). Just ask me. I know from firsthand (first knuckle!)      experience.    </p>
