United States      agriculture is particularly indebted to the trading of farm      labor, a practice as helpful in these years of the family      farm's struggle to survive soaring wages and wavering farm      indices as it was in frontier times when county neighbors      traded labor to clear fields, raise barns and cabins, and      trade the use of plows and oxen.    </p>    <p>      Barter has been one of the principal expedients for      operating United States agriculture. It is one of the great      hopes for keeping it going. It has made possible the      introduction of many great crops of fruits, berries,      grains, and vegetables. It offers present-day means for      introducing future garden and berry crops and for a great      expansion of community markets where surplus produce can be      traded directly for many Kinds of surplus merchandise.    </p>    <p>      The tillable roots of barter grow deep; in our language      they reach back to the ox-powered days of Piers the      Plowman, or perhaps farther. Farming and barter fit      together well because both are essentially specific and      personalized. This has been proved by many farm people in      many places. The most effective advancer of farm barter I      have known is Evelyn Harris, sometimes known as the barter      lady of the Chesapeake Shores.    </p>    <p>      The gallant story began almost a third of a century ago      when Mrs. Harris found herself with a thousand-acre farm,      five young children, and the prospect of a devastating      depression which was already settling on the 500-acre fruit      farm which the Harrises had inherited and worked very hard      to operate. Following her husband's death, Evelyn found      herself the sole support of her five children, plus four      families of good neighbors who had intermittently "helped      out" on the Harris farm. All were counting on "Miz Evey"      for "cash money" wages and, even more importantly, for      sorghum, flour and meal, cured pork, fresh eggs, veal and      mutton, and other staff-of-life factors. Mrs. Harris set      out to barter her way through. In one way or another she      succeeded. Tax paying provided the first motivation. In the      inevitable manner, her taxes came due-even while farm      prices continued to fall apart.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Harris journeyed to the county seat for a      heart-to-heart talk with the tax collector. The tax      collector had no talk to offer beyond reiterating that the      taxes were due and had to be paid. With persistence the      young widow pointed out that she simply could not spare the      last of her operative cash for paying taxes and therefore      requested permission to pay them in farm produce.      Eventually the collector referred her to the county judge.      The county judge was likewise confused. However, after      lengthy reflection the dignitary recalled that the county      road builders were in need of locust posts for building      roadside guard rails. The Harris farm had many acres of      tall young locusts. The county required about five thousand      "rounds" of the long-lasting posts and would pay      thirty-five  cents apiece.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Harris took on the assignment. She employed county      neighbors to fell the young locusts and cut the slender      trunks into poles of specified dimensions. Since two      thousand of the trees were required to fill the order for      guard posts, the choppers were obliged to clear away some      of the vast clutter of discarded tops and branches so that      the county trucks could get in. The sale of five thousand      locust guard posts paid haulage and choppers' wages and      netted about $1,600 in cash, enough to pay the abhorrent      taxes for three years. Even more valuably, it opened the      way for a great and winning game of barter.    </p>    <p>      Tops and unused limbs of the young locusts make superior      fuel wood. Mrs. Harris had neighbors who were eager to      clear up the tops and take pay in farm-raised foods, of      which the Harris farm still had an abundance. They chopped      and stacked about a hundred cords of locust tops and limbs.      Using her husband's truck, the barter lady began trading      locust firewood for needed groceries. Next she began paying      doctor and dentist bills with the same harvest. She next      succeeded in swapping the cordwood for needed bakery      products and for bus travel to and from the town high      school for her two older children.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Harris set out to expand her farm barter further. For      several years the Harrises had been growing, harvesting,      and feeding several hundred bushels of corn to livestock      and poultry. Following the old American extravagance, the      corn cobs had been wasted. The Barter Lady knew from      experience that corn cobs are excellent kindling and one of      the best fuels for broiling fires. She carried the      knowledge to town, and the local barber volunteered to      credit her with a dozen haircuts for her young sons in      return for a truckload of clean corn cobs delivered to his      woodshed.    </p>    <p>      Her next move was to pay for beauty-parlor services with      home-raised frying chickens. In a nearby town she met a      garage and filling-station owner whose hobby was raising      baking chickens. The garage keeper wished to have setting      eggs and newly hatched chicks and was eager to swap      gasoline, motor oil, and mechanic's services for them. Mrs.      Harris happily provided her share of the barter from home      sources. She next located a grain-mill operator who agreed      to swap ten barrels of well-milled flour for fifty bushels      of her wheat, also to grind her corn to meal on shares.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Harris, an accomplished pianist, for several years had      been contributing music for the farm women's club to which      she belonged. The club director asked if she would be      willing to take part in the club's convention in Baltimore,      all expenses provided in return for playing the piano. The      Barter Lady accepted happily, bartering about six hours of      musicianship for a much-enjoyed four-day vacation in the      big city. Next, she swapped home-raised roasting chickens      with a coastal steamship line for a vacation cruise for her      family.<br />    </p>    <p>      The Harrises suffered some rather serious surgery bills and      found that, while most merchandise became cheaper as farm      prices fell, surgery fees stood fixed. A local dentist      accepted fresh fruits, fine berries, native fowl, and      farm-fresh eggs in payment for dental services for the      entire family But the surgeon kept sending bills for the      two appendectomies until the Barter Lady learned that he      cherished one thing above all others-an old-fashioned      week-long fishing vacation. Mrs. Harris offered to supply a      simple but enticing fishing vacation, complete with      homecooked meals, live minnows, crayfish, night crawlers,      catalpa worms, red worms, grasshoppers, and moral      encouragement in settlement of the surgery. The surgeon      eagerly accepted, proved himself an ideal house guest as      well as an able fisherman, and marked the operations paid      in full.<br />    </p>    <p>      Again the Barter Lady had to meet her taxes. This time she      permitted county and state highway crews to dredge and load      out sand and gravel from some of her acres which front on      Chesapeake Bay. Her taxes were met, and in celebration she      tried a variant of barter. She traded a standing walnut      tree as down payment on a piano. When wool prices tumbled      to less than half the usual farm-door low, she had her wool      clip milled into finished warm cloth. She personally shaped      the cloth into sample-measure double blankets, crib      blankets, and auto robes, all warmer, softer, and more      generously sized than those sold in stores. She then      bartered the homemade woolen goods for school books, shoes,      suits, dresses, and other family needs. The strategy here      was especially fine. Nobody wanted shorn wool. But when it      was changed to warm cloth, many were eager to swap for it.    </p>    <p>      The Barter Lady's progress showed other helpful aspects.      For one, she was able to keep her swapping activities close      to home; in great part on home premises, as when neighbors      came with offers to help harvest the fruit crops on shares      or to "work out" the price of a fat pig or a bred ewe or a      baby beef. She effected about a third of her barters in      nearby towns and villages, where she was able to swap with      maximum control for goods and services required directly by      her family, her farm, or herself.    </p>    <p>      Presently the Barter Lady began using the mails to advance      her swapping. Reading is her favorite hobby, and the      scarcity of cash had greatly reduced her supply of books      and magazines. Evelyn began writing letters to the      circulation managers of her favorite magazines, suggesting      that she be permitted to pay for the subscriptions in      apples. They were not ordinary apples; they were her very      special, personally selected greenings, winesaps, and other      honest-to-goodness eating apples, home-raised, home      harvested, and especially stored to supply what most apples      lack nowadays-flavor. She promptly discovered that      most magazine circulation managers have a liking for good      eating apples. Practically every letter brought a gracious      answer and an enthusiastic acceptance of the swap offer.    </p>    <p>      So Mrs. Harris favored one of the well-known book clubs      with a letter suggesting that she be permitted to pay for a      year's selection of books with two bushels of Nancy Hall      sweet potatoes and eight fat, home-dressed roasting      chickens, the latter to be shipped air express at the      expense of the recipient. The book club promptly answered,      "Indeed," and scribbled the post script "delighted."    </p>    <p>      Thus through the years Evelyn Harris used well-planned      barter to raise her family, keep up the productiveness of a      fine farm, help neighbors, and make good friends. One of      her most admirable accomplishments has been the use of farm      barter to demonstrate the distinctive quality of      home-raised foods. As any observant consumer knows, the      real food value of harvests never can be gauged competently      just by the gallon or pound or price tag. Food is life and      the principal cost of living. Nutrition and flavor, which      are frequently as one, are the real measures of food      values. Yet the continual hurry-scurry marketing of farm      crops takes appallingly little account of flavor or      nutritive worth.<br />    </p>    <p>      Tragically, too, the prevailing direction in crop genetics      and grading is toward volume of yield; much more frequently      than not, maturity and honest ripeness are either evaded or      faked. The great bulk of our fruits, our favorite berries,      tomatoes, or food vegetables are harvested far ahead of      actual ripeness; oranges almost invariably are dyed;      commercial pack tomatoes are picked completely green and      permitted to turn pink in storage. Chemical preservatives      and coloring afflict a high percentage of the meats and      meat products we consume. Too frequently potatoes, carrots,      beets, and green vegetables are taken off soils long since      changed to pits of chemical fertilizers; they cannot      possibly taste good or approach complete nutrition. As a      rule, commercial apple crops are no longer bred,      propagated, or sprayed to taste like apples. Too much of      our fowl, eggs, dairy products, beef, and pork taste like      what they preponderantly are, viz., the outputs of      livestock factories rather than creatures born in sunlit      fields, pastures, and feeding pens. We are the number-one      farming nation of the earth and we spend more for food per      capita than any other nation. And while paying for the most      expensive food consumed in any comparably populated area of      earth, we endure much of the worst-flavored and least      nutritious harvests eaten by man.    </p>    <p>      The paradox here is not wholly unavoidable. Barter can be      made one of the more consistent remedies. Evelyn Harris and      many other devoted farmers have long since demonstrated as      much. Because it is direct, personalized, and comparatively      slow motioned, barter is the best facility for respecting      and gaining from the flavor and nutritive values of      harvests. Farming has kept at least the living roots of      personalized trade, abetted by personalized integrity of      production. For these roots, barter serves as the living,      life-sustaining soil.    </p>
