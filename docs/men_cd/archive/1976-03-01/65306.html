                        <h5 id="byline">      by DONALD L. CAIRL    </h5>    <p>      OK, we've heard all the jokes about electric cars not      having long enough extension cords, and listened to      so-called authorities who pooh-pooh battery-powered      commuter vehicles as "impractical". But down in the Lone      Star State there's a man who's taken all the jibes in      stride . . . and come up with a truly viable means of      converting any standard economy car-Vega, Volkswagen,      Pinto, etc.-to electric power.    </p>    <p>      Robert G. Bucy started four years ago with an old Renault      (junkyard variety). The first thing he did was to take out      the car's engine-along with associated hardware, such      as the radiator, muffler, gas tank, and so on-but he      left in the transmission and kept the flywheel. Next, Bucy      went looking for a suitable heavy-duty electric motor . . .      and found just what he needed in a 36-volt 200 ampere unit      from a forklift. To provide power for the rig, Bob rounded      up 16 used golf cart batteries of the 6-volt, 190-ampere      hour type.    </p>    <p>      After laying plywood down in the trunk and under the hood      to hold the batteries (each of which weighs a hefty 60      pounds) Bucy then mated the motor to the salvaged flywheel,      welded up some engine mount brackets, bolted things      together, and in no time was driving the only      electric-powered Renault in Dallas. (Or for that matter,      all of Texas!)    </p>    <p>      Bucy's downright proud of his little automotive creation .      . . because, among other reasons, it's <em>truly      road-worthy.</em> "Most electric cars are actually golf      carts with bodies molded to resemble an auto," Bucy      maintains. "But with my Lectric Kar you have full      suspension, gears, a clutch, and standard brakes."<br />    </p>    <p>      How does the Bucy Kar perform? Well, it won't "burn out" at      a stoplight, and the vehicle's range is limited to 30 miles      at present . . . but the machine can cruise at up to 50 mph      and it will carry Bob to work at a total fuel cost of only      1/2 cent per mile. With a 10-hp motor that's nearly always      being run at capacity, the Lectric Kar is comparable in      efficiency to a motorcycle (hence doesn't cost as much to      operate as even the "ordinary" piston powered version of      the same car).    </p>    <p>      Now, about that "fuel" . . . isn't it true that when you      plug into your power company's lines to charge something      like Lectric Kar's set of batteries, you may be tapping      energy from a plant 100 miles away that's spewing smoke      into the air? "True," says Bucy, "but electrical generating      plants today pollute the atmosphere approximately 100 times      <em>less</em> per unit horsepower than the      internal-combustion-engine vehicles which are causing      nearly 70% of America's air pollution."    </p>    <p>      With a Lectric Kar, then, you'll not only save bundles of      money on gasoline- <em>and</em> lessen your impact on      the environment-but you'll never again need to buy or      change motor oil, antifreeze, spark plugs, fan belts, or      any of a hundred other items that are required to keep a      Detroit iron running.    </p>    <p>      Bucy says that the Lectric Kar conversion costs $400 to      $800 and is something "the average do-it-yourselfer can      handle". Maybe, maybe not. You may need a machinist's help      to fit the flywheel to the forklift motor and, if you don't      weld, you'll have to find someone who does when it comes      time to fabricate your vehicle's new engine mounts.      However, these are things you can pay someone else to do      (using the money you receive from the sale of your      Renault's, VW's, or whatever's old engine).<br />    </p>    <p>      Want to get started on your own Lectric Kar? If so,      conversion plans (not fancy, but they'll tell you what you      need to know) are available from Robert Bucy, 8191 Hunnicut      Rd., Dallas, Tex. 75218 for $22.50 a set. Tell him "MOTHER      sent you".    </p>
