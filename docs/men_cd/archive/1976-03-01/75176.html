                    <p>      <strong>IS IT A STEAK . . . OR A FAKE?</strong> You may not      be able to tell any longer, now that the U.S. Food and Drug      Administration has ruled that manufacturers are no longer      required to identify synthetic foods as "imitation".      Stephen McNamara, an attorney for the FDA (which,      incidentally, was set up <em>to protect the consumer)</em>      said in a recent statement that "Labeling food as an      imitation has had a bad impact on selling because people      think it's inferior."    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHO'S DESTROYING OUR WILDERNESS SYSTEM?</strong>      No, it's not industry, big business, or hordes of      mobile-home tourists: It's the millions of "ecology minded"      backpackers who've not yet learned to adjust their camping      and hiking habits to the severely increased demand for      backwoods recreation. The U.S. Forest Service says the      situation is critical . . . so remember: Don't travel in      large parties . . . don't build fires (even with dead,      fallen wood) unless absolutely necessary . . . avoid using      major trails . . . <em>and pack your trash and your own      waste out.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHICH CAME FIRST: THE CHICKEN, THE EGG . . . OR THE      EXPERTS?</strong> Well, it all started a few decades back      when someone hatched the idea of "supercharging" chickens      with drugs so they'd produce more eggs. The result, of      course, is today's abundant supermarket supply of Grade A      paper-shelled ping-pong balls. But never fear. Researchers      at the Texas Agriculture Extension Service have been      working on the problem, and have come up with yet another      "improvement". They're now experimenting with a special      shell-toughening formula made just for modem poultry:      commercial chicken feed . . . laced with cement.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FUMBLE-FINGERED FOLKS WHO WANT TO BUILD THEIR OWN      LOW-COST HOME</strong> might want to look into an      inexpensive, bolt together"instant house" called      "Hexadome". We haven't seen the structure ourselves, but      the manufacturer (Hexadome, Box 2351, La Mesa, Calif.      92041) says the plywood unit comes shipped in kit form (24      triangles, two trapezoids, and all necessary hardware) . .      . can be assembled weather tight in just a few days (using      little more than a wrench) . . . and costs just $2,500. The      company will send you a brochure on their product in      exchange for a stamped, self-addressed business-size      envelope.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A RECENT STUDY ON CHILDBIRTH,</strong> prepared for      The American Public Health Association by a team from      Stanford University, says that mothers whose babies are      delivered at home by midwives have fewer complications and      healthier infants than those who deliver in a hospital. The      research indicates that the sitting or squatting positions      commonly adapted during domestic deliveries . . . the      absence of drugs . . . and the relaxed atmosphere of      familiar surroundings make childbirth easier and safer for      all involved.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOLKS LIVING IN ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF      HOUSING</strong> -domes, inflatables, sod structures,      or others-might want to get in touch with a young      movie-maker named Tom Schroeppel. The American Film      Institute has given Tom a grant to put together a half-hour      reel on the subject . . . and lie's looking for as many      "New Age" builders as he can find. You can reach him at 241      S. Royal Poinciana, Miami Springs, Fla. 33166, (305)      885-4997.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ESKIMOS WHO'VE SWITCHED FROM DOGSLEDS TO      SNOWMOBILES</strong> are learning an all-too-expensive      lesson on the "benefits" of modem-day transportation. A      recent issue of <em>Audubon</em> magazine reports that a      survey of 3,770 Eskimos in the Northwest Territories of      Canada showed that 33 percent of adult males-in fact,      83 percent of the men in one Baffin Island village-suffered      from impaired hearing that could be directly attributed to      long hours of high-speed hunting behind the wheels of those      noisy, gas-guzzling machines.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN EXPERIMENT AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF      TECHNOLOGY</strong> involving the substitution of methanol      (wood alcohol) for gasoline in 200 automobiles came to a      halt shortly after Exxon Corporation donated $500,000 to      the school, according to a report in <em>Science</em>      magazine. University officials admit that Exxon bad been      opposed to the study . . . but deny any connection between      Exxon's "gift" and the decision to can the experiment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SAUDI ARABIA'S PRINCE MUHAMMAD FAISAL</strong> is      reportedly considering a plan to tow icebergs from the      South Pole to the Red Sea in order to increase his      country's supply of drinking water. The      geothermal/meteorological impact of such a maneuver is not      known at present.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PACKAGING IS ON THE INCREASE</strong> according to      government statistics. The Environmental Protection Agency      estimates that in 1971 the packaging industry accounted for      <em>half</em> of all paper usage, three-quarters of total      glass production, 14% of aluminum, and 8% of plastic output      in this country. From 195 8 to 197 1, the total consumption      of packaging materials increased by nearly 71%.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO RENOVATE A RUN-DOWN HOUSE</strong> is the      subject of a recent USDA booklet, <em>New Life For Old      Dwellings.</em> The 99-page manual tells-with words,      photos, and diagrams-both how to appraise an old      structure to see if it can be salvaged, and how to      rehabilitate it once you've made up your mind to move in.      Copies of the book are available for $1.70 each from the      Government Printing Office, 7 10 North Capitol St.,      Washington, D.C. 20402.<br />    </p>
