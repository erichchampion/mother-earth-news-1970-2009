                    <p>      This page contains excerpts from issues of <em>The American      Agriculturist</em> dated 1891.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Raising Be" Lettuce In Summer.-</strong>      James Leech , Allegheny Co., Pa., desires info ton about      manure for lettuce. In or experience there to nothing      better than ordinary barnyard manure, but, no matter what      kind of manure to used, it is difficult to raise good,      solid heads in hot and dry weather. A good deal depends on      the kind of lettuce planted. The best heads we have ever      been able to raise In summer were of the Damon lettuce.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Keeping Jer usalem Artichokes.</strong> -W.      H. Shaw, St. Francois Co., Me.: Jerusalem artichokes may be      wintered in the same manner as potatoes. The *color they we      kept without freezing the better they will come out In the      spring. If It is a small quantity that Is to be kept, it Is      better to put them in a frost-proof caller, in a barrel or      box, and cover them with dry soil or sand.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Incubators.</strong> -B. S. X., Park City,      Utah, desires to know whether a woman can manage an      Incubator alone, providing she has already some experience      in raising chickens. Incubators can be managed by any      Intelligent adult, but of course there will be something to      learn at first. All the Incubators advertised In the      AMERICAN AGRICULTURIST are reliable, differing only in      preference and claims of manufactures.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Vineyardist.</strong> -S. Rankin, Cincinnati.      O.: You may now use the word 'I vineyardist " for one who      works In or takes cam of a vineyard without few that some      one may tell Von that it to not recognized by our      lexicographers for it has at last found a place In a      dictionary. The late edition of Websters ,"International"      admits it, and all cultivators of the grape should rejoice      over the recognition of a good English word which has been      in common use In this country for newly or quite half a      century. As horticulturists and agriculturlate we may be      thankful for small favors, and hope that our lexicographers      will not forget us In future editions of their great      lexicons.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chickens Dying.-</strong> Miss M. D. X.,      Hampshire Co., X. The fact that only those given liberty      were affected Indicates a probability of the hens being      poisoned in some manner, especially if you or your      neighbors have carelessly allowed Paris green to be placed      where they mold reach It. Or, If not, they way be crop      bound from eating dried grass, Induced by their liberty and      lack of green food.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Feeding Turnips</strong> .-Dairyman,      Northampton Co., Pa.: You cannot feed turnips to milch come      without affecting the Asivor of the butter and giving it a      turnipy taste. It will make little or no differ once      whether the turnips we fed before or after milking, with or      without salt the scent of the turnips will pass Into the      milk veins and milk. Furthermore. If turnips, cabbages, and      similar strong scented vegetables are cut up and fed to      other animals In the same ham or stable where milch cows we      standing, the very air breathed by the milch cows will be      laden with the strong odor, and this will taint the milk.      Pare and fresh air in just as Important as pure and nearly      inodorous food for cows In order that they should give the      best quality of milk for butter making. There are no doubt,      sows which are not so susceptible to the effect of poor and      strongly wanted food as others but they and not, as a rule,      animals that give the richest milk.<br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>What Horses Sell Best?</strong> -J. Y.      Gedney, Mitchell CO., Iowa, desires to know what kind of      horses sell best. This doubtless refers to horses for all      purposes. There are many good horses brought from Iowa to      New York State. Speed will not be noticed. Horses having      the following form will always sell: A good sized bony      head, full, kind eye' pricked ears, good crest, oblique      shoulders, short on back, long oil belly, somewhat arched      at coupling well ribbed up, heavy boned, short, flat legs,      compact, blocky, active, good tempered, and a good walker.      Also he should have size and weight, say from 1,000 pounds      upward.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grubs Eating Strawberries.-</strong> Edward      R. Hastings, Middlesex Co., Mass., writes us: There is one      good point in favor of nitrate soda that I have not seen      noticed. I have used it in small quantities for a number of      years. In applying large quantities of manure to      strawberries I was troubled by muck worms (the larvae of      the May beetle) eating the plants. A heavy application of      nitrate of soda seemed to keep them away from a bed to      which I applied it. We applied a heavy dressing of nitrate      of soda last year to early cab bages. It made the cabbages      grow rapidly but it had no apparent effect on the grubs      which attacked the roots or stems of some of the plants.      But we think it sometimes cheeks the ravages of the onion      maggots. Probably because It makes the plants grow so      rapidly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fowls Eating Salt.</strong> - R. L. Spencer,      Monmouth Co., N. J.: The symptoms of fowls having eaten      salt would be excessive thirst, convulsions, mouth open      constantly, resulting in death in a few hours, according to      the quantity of "It eaten.    </p>        <h3>      THE PERKINS'<br />      Wind Mill    </h3>    <p>      Is the Strongest and Best Self. Regulating Wind Mill made.      Full instructions for erecting sent with the first mill.      All Wind Mills warranted. For Circulars and Prices address.      The Perkins' Wind Mill & Ax Co. Agents wanted.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Beat Use of Muck.</strong> -Willard Agans      Herkimer Co., N. Y., ham a muck swamp which is well      drained, and desires information In regard to making it the      most available as a fertilizer. The most profitable use to      which muck can be lint Is to use it as an absorbent In the      stable or barnyard. Mild winter days afford all excellent      opportunity for digging and carting muck to places where it      can be easily handled for these purposes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Enormous Vegetables From Washington</strong>      -Isaac Cathcart, Snohomish Co., Wash., has raised an      Early Rose potato weighing five pounds four ounces. Robert      T. Flynn, Kitsap Co., Wash:, 'as raised a turnip weighing      twenty pounds and measuring thirty-six Inches in      circumference. The above specimens have been forwarded to      New York for exhibition.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Selection of Breeds of Fowls.</strong> -M. T.      Waters. Hamilton Co., 0., proposes to start in the business      of raising poultry with a few pure Leghorns for the      production of eggs, and Light Brahmas or Plymouth Rocks for      rearing chickens. This selection of breeds and proposed      method should lead to success, it good management and care      are given.    </p>    <p>      <strong>French Method of Fattening Fowls.</strong>      -Subscriber: The method of the French is to fatten      fowls by confining them in coops or stalls, an attendant      inserting a tube In the throat and the crop is filled by      forcing food down the throat. In other words, the food is      "pumped" down the fowl. The food Is mostly carbonaceous,      ground grain and milk predominating.    </p>        <p>      <strong>"Phosphates" for Garden Crops</strong> -S. K.      Green, Monroe Co., X. X., writes: "I run a garden farm and      have four acres of asparagus, three acres early cabbage,      four acres unions, strawberries, etc., and us all the      manure I can get. I have tried phosphate, but don't see      much good from It." Our own experience confirms this      statement so far as the crops named are concerned. With the      exception of lettuce and turnips, we think the average      "phosphates" we not rich enough In nitrogen to show any      marked effect on garden crops. In buying fertilizers, the      gardener and fruit - grower should either buy the      phosphate, potash and nitrogen separately and do his own      mixing, or he should buy a brand of fertilizer that      contains a liberal percentage of nitrogen-say five or six      per cent of soluble or readily available nitrogen.    </p>        <p>      This Instrument Containing 22 NOTES (6 MORE than is      contained in any other like instrument) is unequalled for      durability, power, and sweetness of tone.
