               <p><strong>ADDENDUM TO:</strong></p>            <h5 id="byline">     by ROBERT WADE    </h5>    <h3>      MECHANICAL INSTALLATION    </h3>    <p>      In the "Installation Procedures" on page 78 of MOTHER NO.      37 I've outlined how to erect a sip manually. However, some      signs can be too heavy or too tall to work with in this      manner . . . in which case you'll need some additional      mechanical help, perhaps in the form of a winch or a      come-along. Such devices will enable you to take on a much      larger sign than you can handle manually.    </p>    <p>      If, however, the installation job still staggers your      imagination, get a crane. In most areas, cranes are      available-with operator-for thirty-five dollars an      hour. All travel time is included in the bill, though,      so-depending upon how far the crane must trek to      reach the installation site-a typical tab for such      help can run from fifty to one hundred dollars. To avoid      unnecessary overtime charges, be sure to do your      site-preparation homework before such a piece of equipment      arrives. If the crane has to wait around while you assemble      the sign to its posts, you'll be billed for the delay . . .      and that can run into lots a bucks.    </p>    <p>      Likewise, you may wish to send for a concrete truck to come      and drop any "mud" you need into the appropriate postholes.      The usual minimum order of concrete is one yard (that is,      one cubic yard) and it's doubtful that you're gonna have      any use for anywhere near that much. But you'll have to pay      for the minimum anyway . . . about thirty dollars      delivered. Here again, coordinate delivery of the concrete      so that you'll be ready to pour when it arrives, because      the driver's not going to sit around while you dig the      holes.    </p>    <p>      Assembly of your sign to its supports will have to be done      on the installation site, unless you have access to a      flatbed truck or trailer large enough to transport the      completely fabricated unit. If you're going to move the      sign around much during transport or installation, it's a      good idea to cradle or support it temporarily on 2 X 4's      held in place by double headed nails (which are easy to      remove after installation).    </p>    <p>      When you dig the postholes, place a straight 2 X 4 directly      between the two excavations and check with a level to make      sure you're measuring to the same depth for both holes.      When the 2 X 4 is level, you're ready to slip a measuring      tape down inside the holes and check their depths . . .      which should, as mentioned, be the same.    </p>    <p>      Before you begin, take a saw or axe and shape the bottom      end of each signpost into a point so that it can be wiggled      into final position more easily.    </p>    <p>      When the sip is upright, have the crane-or your      assistants-hold it in place while you "sight it up"      by eye and with your level on at least two sides of each      post. If the whole assembly isn't absolutely vertical both      "fore and aft" and "left and right", throw a little dirt      into the bottom of one of the holes. Then tilt and adjust      the uprights using a sledge and a steel prybar until      everything lines up straight. Next pound bracing stakes in      deeply with a sledge, and nail supporting 2 X 4's between      the signposts and the brace stakes. And, finally, double      check to make sure everything is perfectly level and      straight before you permanently spike the main uprights to      their braces . . . many customers are very exacting in      their demand for a level and square sign.    </p>    <p>      And while you're running checks on all the uprights, don't      forget to run a level check on a few of the assembled sip's      horizontal surfaces. If it has been constructed properly,      using a builder's square-and if the foregoing      procedures were followed-the sign will be rigid and      square before and after final assembly and installation.    </p>    <p>      Avoid the use of flimsy sign components. Signposts that are      made of two pieces nailed or glued together lengthwise I      find particularly offensive. A joint in the middle of one      of the main supports weakens the whole structure. The      integrity of these uprights can be threatened also if you      cut their notches too deep when fitting cross-members to      them.    </p>    <p>      If the sign support structure is overbuilt to begin with,      additional decorative thicknesses may be added to the      posts, providing the cross sections of the main supports      measure four inches by six inches or thicker.    </p>    <h3>      MORE TIPS ON INSTALLATION    </h3>    <p>      If you intend to do very many installations, you should      obtain a 50-pound (or heavier) steel bar with a pointed tip      on one end. This implement can then be used to bust through      most asphalt or concrete, should you run into such      obstructions where you wish to dig your holes. (Special      concrete-cutting bits may also be used to weaken the      material . . . just drill several holes across the chunk      you want to break off and then hit it with your steel bar.)      Be certain that the concrete you're smashing is not a      municipal water or drain pipe, and please, find out the      location of all utility lines before you start your      excavations. Even then, dig carefully to avoid breakage.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, some locales require that you carry insurance      to guard against any tragedy caused by your sign's      collapse. This is worth looking into.    </p>    <p>      You won't-unless local ordinance requires-need      to use concrete at all to secure your signposts if you sink      the support posts to a depth equal to one-third the total      length of the uprights. Of course, if the posts are to      raise the sign ten feet above the ground and you use this      rule of thumb, you'll need holes that are five feet deep.      Obviously, such excavations are out of the question using a      conventional posthole digger.    </p>    <p>      It's plain to see that the business of installing signs can      turn into involved (and dirty) work. If you don't feel      qualified, leave this or any other phase of the sign      business to experts, or at least to someone with knowledge      of the work to be done. If you do decide to do your own      installations, charge plenty for it. Anywhere from one to      two hundred dollars may be necessary, not counting the cost      of the posts.    </p>    <h3>      THE IDEAL WORKSHOP    </h3>        <p>      Something I should have stressed sufficiently before is the      necessity for a well-organized and complete workshop. Here      I'm talking about all the areas of the shop including wood      supply, hardware, paint, and tools.    </p>    <p>      If you can afford it, lay in a good stock of the sizes and      grades of wood you'll need most consistently. Frequently,      you can get excellent buys if you offer your local      lumberyard a lump-sum price on wood that's not selling. The      dealer may be anxious to get the materials off his hands.    </p>    <p>      Good buys can also be had by watching the local paper or      shopper. This applies to all tools and supplies. You'll      find that running to the store every time you need a little      wood, a brush, or a bolt will soon cost you more in gas and      time than you could ever have imagined . . . not to mention      the ton in annoyance. As soon as possible, try to establish      an account with a wholesale lumber company. You'll have to      purchase a considerable quantity of wood-two hundred      dollars' worth, at least-but you'll find that      wholesale lumber only costs about half of what your      friendly retailer charges.    </p>    <p>      A well-organized shop eventually means good lighting,      heating, and bench power tools at your disposal. Bench      tools are fairly inexpensive if purchased used. If you buy      anything "previously owned". be sure you can find a model      number or other identification for ordering replacement      parts before you hand over your dough. Also, be sure that      the tool is in good repair.    </p>    <p>      Make the seller demonstrate the item and explain any      irregularities to your satisfaction.    </p>    <p>      Is the machine heavy duty enough for your needs? A      three-horse-power thickness planer (not a jointer-planer)      can only remove the fuzz from a plank. To make the board      perfectly smooth, it'll probably take two passes with this      machine . . . in other words, twice the time.    </p>    <p>      The small table on the typical four-inch jointer/planer      will probably prove too short to accommodate long boards      without allowing the plank to fall down due to lack of      support under its far end. You can remedy this if you add      an accurately measured table extension-to hold up long      boards-to the far end of the planer. However, if you had      purchased a planer six inches wide or wider, you'd likely      not need a table extension due to the longer table that      comes with such a machine.    </p>    <p>      One tool that is truly wonderful is a band saw, and even a      small one will do to begin with. It cuts with tremendous      speed and accuracy-even when tracing intricate      shapes-and is twice the machine that a heavy duty      sabre saw is, if you use a sharp blade and read up on how      to operate it. (Innumerable books have been written on this      and other power tools . . . you'll find them extremely      helpful.)    </p>    <p>      You'll find with time that these bench tools make you      increasingly dependent upon them . . . and rightly so, as      they are marvelously efficient machines.    </p>    <h3>      WHADDAYA WAITING FOR?    </h3>    <p>      The foregoing article and this addendum form a very      thorough outline of the subject of wood sign building and      carving. Only your experience will fill in the blanks, as      it'd take a whole book-on which I'm working-to      fully detail the processes involved in making a business of      this type thrive. At any rate, though, this information      should be sufficient to get you started . . . whether you      want a full-scale sign-making enterprise, or just the      opportunity to make a few simple nameplates, billboards,      and professional shingles for yourself or your friends.    </p>    <h3>      CORRECTIONS FOR THE ORIGINAL TWO-PART ARTICLE    </h3>    <p>      Under the subhead of "Gold Leaf" on page 79 of Issue No.      36, an obvious contradiction appears in the last sentence.      The sentence should read: "Use a gold paint only if the      customer insists, and then only after warning him."    </p>    <p>      In Fig. 12 of Issue No. 36, the caption under the      illustration of the mallet should read: "Mallet for carving      is usually made of extremely hard wood, such as lignum      vitae."    </p>
