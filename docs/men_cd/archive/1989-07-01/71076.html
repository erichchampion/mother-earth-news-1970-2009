                <p>      ENVIRONMENTALISM AND SPIRITUALITY PART IV    </p>                <h5 id="byline">      by Pat Stone    </h5>    <p>      <strong>IT HAPPENED WHILE HANNAH WAS</strong> driving      Albert, David, Colt and Claude, four Belgian draft horses      that were pulling both the hay baler and the flatbed      loading wagon. I was behind on the wagon, grabbing the      blocks of fresh May hay the gas-powered baler churned out      and stacking them in a 3-33-2-1 pattern.    </p>    <p>      Suddenly Hannah stopped the team, jumped out, walked into      the mow of cut hay just ahead and gently picked up two      immature Savannah sparrows. She carried them out of harm's      way, setting them in a timothy field that wasn't going to      be cut for at least two weeks (until the young bobolinks      nesting in it were fully fledged).    </p>    <p>      I rested, wiping sweat and marveling at this Amishwoman's      concern for two baby birds. Then I looked back toward the      barn and saw 10-year-old Samuel driving the family's      peculiar 65-horse John Deere tractor, with its little      pneumatic tires up front, but uninflated, bolted-on rubber      ones in back. He was bringing out my next empty wagon. Yes,      that's when it happened-when I got my first clue into      understanding the riddles of Amish culture.    </p>    <p>      <em>The Amish are the answer to a question,</em> I      realized. All the odd, apparent contradictions I was      witnessing were part of an overall cultural solution to a      broad, basic problem. A horse-drawn gasoline engine? A      tractor with two different types of tires, which hauled      things to and from the field but did no work in the field?      The fact that I could see the farmer next door loading all      his hay loose and then baling it-with an identical      gasoline baler-only after it was in his barn? Somehow      these things were all answers to the same question.    </p>    <p>      <em>What was the question?</em>    </p>    <p>      Ah, <em>that's</em> what I still had to figure out.    </p>    <p>      Three days earlier, I had driven to the Yoder place in      Amish-populated Elkhart County, Indiana. I was nervous.      True, Amos Yoder had invited me to visit him at his 65-acre      dairy farm. But everything I saw as I got closer, from the      horse droppings on the highway to the plain black carriages      filled with faces that looked none too happy to see another      <em>English</em> (Amish call outsiders English in reference      to America's primary language), made me feel out of place.    </p>    <p>      Then I drove up the driveway of the immaculate Yoder farm      (lawn trim and green, barns and home clean and white), got      out, met Amos and was introduced to Hannah, his wife.      Hannah, short and sturdy, scanned me with eyes at once      cordial and cautious. I hardly noticed; I was staring at      her clothes. Not the plain, blue dress, the triangular      shawl pinned to an apron, the simple white devotional cap.      I'd expected all that. No, it was her shoes. She was      wearing Sears' sneakers with Velcro fasteners!    </p>    <p>      Clearly, everything wasn't going to be quite as different      as I'd anticipated. And somehow that was reassuring. It      made this whole new world I had just entered seem less      strange.    </p>        <p>      Indeed, that was one of the main lessons I learned on my      visit: Amish people are, well, just people. That may not      sound like much of a discovery, but the more I'd read about      them, the more I'd learned how different they are from most      Americans-how they have deliberately set themselves apart,      based on biblical dictums to not be "part of this world,"      but rather to be a "peculiar people." Once among them,      though, I was struck as much by what we shared as by what      we didn't.    </p>    <p>      Hannah greeted me, wearing a plain, blue dress, white      devotional cap- and Sears' Velcro sneakers!    </p>    <p>      Their kids sure acted like mine. When I dropped a bit of      meat at the dinner table, 10-year-old Samuel (a      cherub-faced scamp) was as quick to crack, "A swing and a      miss!" as my own nine-year-old son could ever be. Cute,      wire-thin, eight-year-old Katie was as willing to debate      who should feed the pet fox as my Jesse is to haggle over      feeding our dog. Solemn Marsha, the 13-year-old, could      demonstrate the moodiness of adolescent angst as well as      any teenager I know. Lovely Ruth, the 18-year-old, though      normally calm and peaceful, would argue forcefully with her      mom over the best choice of glasses for serving milkshakes      at her volleyball party. (A riddle: How does an Amish      family fix chocolate milkshakes? By mixing vanilla ice      cream, milk and Nestle's Quik . . . with a hand eggbeater!)      And the oldest offspring, 20-year-old Jonathan, had a      strong hankering to play softball on the first day of      haying. (That's how I got the job of loading the wagon.)    </p>    <p>      The parents, too, were "just plain folk." Hannah had a      reputation for spunkiness. Indeed, Amos said that's what      first caught his eye: She stuck her tongue out at him.      (Hannah: "What was I supposed to do? A bunch of boys I      don't know riding by in a car. I was 13!") Amos, meanwhile,      showed a particular fondness for food. However, he denied      that his love for farm cooking contributed to a slight      midriff bulge. "Our good well water has too many calories,"      he claimed.    </p>    <p>      The Yoders are all fine, warm people, and I came to value      their friendship. The only reason I've perhaps "told      stories on them" here in print is to emphasize Amish      humanness. Remember such qualities, because, by necessity,      the rest of this piece will focus mainly on the      <em>differences</em> between their culture and mainstream      American society.    </p>    <p>      Ironically, I was poignantly reminded of those differences      the last night of my visit. As a thank-you treat, I      took the family out to dinner, escorting them in my Avis      sedan to a burger joint in a nearby town. As soon as I      entered that restaurant with an Amish family, I felt an      electricity of separateness-like a black man on the white      side of Selma. Nothing overt, just a feeling in the air. We      all pigged out on such delicacies as peanut butter      milkshakes and bacon double cheeseburgers (and even ordered      a couple of take-out custards for the grandparents back      home). Then the waitress brought the check. Or, rather,      checks: She gave one to Amos and a separate one to me.    </p>    <p>      So, on to differences. The Yoders, like other Old Order      Amish, dress in a plain, carefully prescribed manner, from      the full beards (but shaved mustaches) and broad-brimmed      hats of the men to the long, solid-toned dresses and      devotional caps of the women. They drive black, horse-drawn      carriages, not cars. They have no electricity or personal      telephones. No radios, TVs or musical instruments. They      speak a separate language, Pennsylvania Dutch (actually,      <em>Dietsch</em> , their term for German). However, they      very courteously spoke English-even to each      other-whenever I was present.    </p>    <p>      Still, their home isn't as stark as it may sound. It holds      many modern conveniences: a propane (and therefore      wonderfully silent) refrigerator, white-gas reading lights,      indoor plumbing with hot and cold running water even a      basement washing machine powered by a small Honda      lawn-mower engine. ("The women love the little Hondas,"      Amos said. "They're so easy to start.") So the family has      many basic conveniences normally provided by electricity.    </p>    <p>      Likewise, when they want to make a phone call, they can      walk down the road to a shared neighborhood phone (kept in      a locked homebuilt booth). If they need to get somewhere a      good distance away, they can hire a car and driver to take      them there.    </p>    <p>      <em>More of these apparent cultural      contradictions-those puzzling answers to that still      undefined question.</em>    </p>    <p>      To help figure it all out, I turned to Amish history and      literature. This Protestant religious group was formed in      the 16th century in Switzerland. Their most visible early      distinction was their belief in the baptism of informed      adults-not of infants. (Hence, their original name      was the <em>Anabaptists</em> , or rebaptizers.) Eventually      they split into two groups, the Amish (after Jacob Amman)      and the Mennonites (after Menno Simons). Today there are at      least 13 degrees of Amishness or Mennoniteness. The most      liberal drive cars and dress like other Americans. The most      conservative don't even have iceboxes. Yoder's family is      part of a typical Old Order (fairly conservative) branch.    </p>    <p>      The central principle of Amish creed and culture is      <em>gelassenheit</em> , a word meaning self-surrender, or      submission to God's will. In contrast to the "I believe,      therefore I am saved" credo of evangelistic Christianity,      the Amish believe that the basis of redemption is the      practice of <em>gelassenheit</em> , dying to one's self.      And how does one do that? First, by not asserting oneself.      As Amos told me, "The word 'proud' is anathema to the      Amish." (For this reason, the Yoders asked me to take no      photographs of them and to change their names in this      article.) Wearing similar clothes and living prescribed      lifestyles both help check prideful individuality. The      second way to practice <em>gelassenheit</em> is to work on      building community. The more everyone helps others and      builds a loving brotherhood, the more they all surrender      self and better live out their Christian ideals.    </p>    <p>      To this end, the Amish have a very carefully laid out set      of rules to follow-the <em>Ordnung</em> -which      is defined by scriptural texts and by community consensus.      Church members who violate the <em>Ordnung</em> and won't      heed warnings to stop are, again by congregational      consensus, put under the Meidung, the ban. Members cannot      socialize or do business with such shunned ones until they      repent. (The community will, however, help them out if the      need arises.)    </p>    <p>      Thus, the Amish don't have a Sunday only religion but try      to closely follow and live by the Scriptures in everything      they do. Following passages in the New Testament, they      don't "conform to the ways of the world" but live in a      separate manner, not letting themselves become "yoked" to      unbelievers. They don't swear oaths, and they are      passivists.    </p>    <p>      And here I found the question I was looking for. From the      Amish point of view it is, <em>How do you create an entire      community dedicated to God and not to the world?</em> All      the puzzling cultural answers I had observed followed from      their solution to that problem: by making decisions as a      community. If individuals had complete freedom to make      their own cultural choices, the overall community values      would inevitably erode. (Someone would get a car, TV or      other product of mainstream culture, and eventually others      would follow suit.) Yet new decisions have to be made. The      culture must be able to adapt as needed for survival, to      adjust to the outside world without getting swallowed up by      it. So every local Amish congregation can, by consensus,      modify the <em>Ordnung</em> when necessary.    </p>    <p>      Further, each decision has a rationale behind it. So it's      OK to make outgoing calls on a community phone but not to      have one in your home? Yes, because the only people you can      call on a community phone are English (not other Amish), so      the phones will be used only for necessary business. You      can't own a car but can hire a driver? Then if you need a      car for an exceptional reason (perhaps to get a relative to      a hospital), you can arrange for one, but your normal      visiting circle will still be limited to your community of      nearby neighbors. You can't have electricity but can have      some normally electric appliances? That way, you won't be      yoked to the unbeliever via a power line-and won't get      engulfed by all the electrical doodads of mainstream      consumer culture. You can use a tractor for hauling (or for      stationary power when running such tools as a grinder) but      not for field work? That way, your farm will stay small      (horses can work only so much land), and you won't swallow      up your neighbors'. The tractor has pneumatic tires up      front (to save wear on the engine) but lugged ones in back      (which can't be used on state roads and so keep you from      using it for transportation). Even the puzzling fact that      Yoder uses his baler in the field but his neighbor does so      only in the barn comes clear. The neighbor belongs to a      different local church, and his congregation made a      different ruling on the best way to limit gasoline-powered      farm machinery.    </p>    <p>      Ultimately, no matter where the Amish draw their cultural      lines, there will be places along the boundary that appear      contradictory. The point, though, is <em>drawing a line at      all</em> : using values to make cultural choices.    </p>    <p>      Reframe the same question from another point of view and      this spiritual query becomes a very important environmental      one: How do you control technology instead of having it      control you? As Kentucky farmer-essayist Wendell Berry has      written, "The Amish are the truest geniuses of technology,      for they understand the necessity of limiting it, and they      know <em>how</em> to limit it."    </p>    <p>      Mainstream American culture has never dared address the      possibility of choosing between which new technologies will      have positive environmental impacts and which won't. If      someone invents it-from an electric hair dryer to the      nuclear bomb-we use it. Occasionally, after a choice      has already caused great damage, we ban or limit it (RIP,      DDT). But have we ever shown the cultural foresight or      courage to close the door on a possibility beforehand?    </p>    <p>      The Amish are thus not a backward, antiquated culture (as      the thriving English tourist industries portray them) but a      traditional-modern hybrid that is fully aware of the      outside world and chooses carefully from its offerings.      Amish children are not kept ignorant of the lures and      luxuries of the outside world. Indeed, some teenage Amish      experiment with driving, drinking and more. (Jonathan told      me of some Amish boys who "like to sow their wild oats,      then pray for a crop failure.") They then feel that they      know enough of both worlds to, when mature, make their own      choices. And not all of them remain Amish: for instance,      only two of Hannah's six siblings had.    </p>    <p>      The archetypal example of the difference between Amish and      mainstream American thinking is agriculture. Conventional      farms are often chemical addicts, with soil that gets high      (yields) on drugs (chemical fertilizers and pesticides).      The agribusiness credo: Bigger is better. So what if      topsoil erodes by the truckload? If ever-increasing water      usage drains eons-old aquifers? If family farmers and farm      communities become extinct?    </p>    <p>      Now, look at the Yoder farm. Amos uses four-year crop      rotation on his fields; corn to oats to wheat to hay. This      rotation provides rich soil fertility (no chemical      fertilizers) and keeps down weeds (almost no herbicides)      and harmful insects (no insecticides). Yoder, along with      most of his farming neighbors, is thus, while not entirely      organic, a low-chemical farmer. He has low expenses, too;      he grows much of his own fuel-the hay and grain for      his draft horses.    </p>        <p>      Those horses provide other benefits. For instance, they      don't compact the soil the way tractors do. Amish farmers      who buy tractored farms find that the soil doesn't loosen      back up until after three years of farming with horses. And      Oberlin College researchers found that the Amish      horse-worked farmland absorbs and holds almost seven times      more water than conventional no-till fields.    </p>    <p>      True, a diversified, low-chemical livestock-and-crops farm      requires more labor per acre than do today's monoculture      spreads. But that's not a problem for the Amish, because      they are successful breeders of the most vital farm crop of      all: future farmers. The children in their typically large      families all learn to help-little Katie was right out there      at 5:30 in the morning washing and stripping udders.      Children quit their Amish schools after the eighth grade      and work on the family farm until they marry. And many of      the children do stay in farming when they mature. Both      Jonathan and Ruth planned to.    </p>    <p>      Likewise, Amish farmers help each other out. They join      together to thrash each other's wheat or to get in a sick      neighbor's hay. The community as a whole esteems farming as      the most valued occupation; they feel that being close to      the land is being close to God. (Amos, opening a screen      door to let a bumblebee out, said, "You can feel the      Creator in nature. You see his handiwork.")    </p>    <p>      Indeed, the real backbone of Amish agriculture is religion.      Wendell Berry calls it "Christian agriculture, formed upon      the understanding that it is sinful for people to misuse or      destroy what they did not make." John Hostetler, author of      Amish Society, points out that "soil has a spiritual      significance for the Amish because God created it in the      Garden of Eden. Man's first duty is to dress the garden, to      till it and manage it as a good steward. Second, man is to      keep the garden, protect it from exploitation." And Yoder      told me, at once both lightly and earnestly, "It helps you      act ecologically if you know you're going to hell if you      don't."    </p>    <p>      What does all this mean to the larger American society? For      one thing, that small-scale family farming <em>can</em>      still work. Yoder grosses over $40,000 from 65 tillable      acres, working steadily but by no means fanatically: I saw      him take two naps in one day. Likewise, the Amish as a      whole are doing fine. Their population in the U.S. has      tripled (to 100,000) in the last 35 years. So chemical      agribiz, with its environmentally destructive side effects,      is not the only way to go.    </p>        <p>      The Amish also demonstrate-in vivid, day-today living-the      premise upon which this four-part series has been based:      that spiritual motivation can, indeed, lead to positive      ecological acts.    </p>    <p>      Amish society isn't perfect. It is legalistic and      restrictive. Internal differences have often caused      disruptive divisions. And the difficulty of becoming, and      <em>living</em> , Amish eliminates the possibility that      their culture will ever spread widely.    </p>    <p>      But a backward tourist attraction? An agricultural      anachronism? A bizarre religious cult? Rather, people of      any faith can appreciate the ways the Amish, in all aspects      of life, try to <em>live</em> their belief.      Environmentalists should study the way the Amish work with      nature, and the way these people include humans as a part      of that relationship. (One Amish farmer-who in one      day counted more than 1,800 young birds within 200 feet of      his house-notes, "On this type of farm we enhance the      land for wildlife rather than being detrimental.") And      anyone interested in the conjunction of environmentalism      and spirituality should admire the way that, more than any      other contemporary culture in America, the Amish have      joined the two.    </p>
