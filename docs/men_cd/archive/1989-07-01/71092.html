                <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S HANDBOOK</strong>    </p>        <p>      How to make sure the land you're about to buy isn't a      "water wasteland."    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Les and Carol Scher    </h5>    <p>      <strong>MOST PEOPLE BUY LAND IN THE</strong> spring and      early summer when creeks are full, springwater is bursting      from the hills and the meadows are green. In late August      and September, the early buyer is often shocked to find      that all of his water has dried up. If you have lived      primarily in urban areas where water has always been just a      turn of the tap away, you don't realize the work and      expense involved in bringing water where you want it. Just      to get running water into your house might involve      installing a generator, pump, pipeline, holding tank and      well. You might see land with a beautiful creek and not      realize that it is too far away from the nicest building      site to be of any value.    </p>    <p>      If there is no water visible on the land, you will be told      that everyone in the area uses wells and that if you dig      deep enough you will find water. The facts are that not all      land has underground water, finding any is often difficult      and drilling a well is expensive. A big creek or a good      well on a neighboring property does not mean there is water      on your land. Do not be fooled by such misconceptions.    </p>    <h3>Water Sources</h3>    <p>      Water sources are either on the surface or underground.      Surface waters include rivers, streams, creeks, ponds,      springs and cisterns.    </p>    <p>      Water is trapped underground in two types of areas: in      aquifers, loose water-bearing materials such as gravel,      sand and clay; or in consolidated water-bearing rocks,      notably limestone, basalt and sandstone. In many cases,      surface water sources are excellent for irrigation,      livestock, fire fighting, ponds and other uses, but cannot      be utilized for drinking. Therefore, a well is often a      necessity regardless of the presence of surface water.    </p>    <p>      <em>Rivers, streams and creeks.</em> Rivers, streams and      creeks differ primarily in size and length. Rivers are      large watercourses, which are often navigable and public.      You may find that you have to share your river with      motorboats, water-skiers and swimmers.    </p>    <p>      Streams and creeks are much smaller than rivers and often      do not flow continuously throughout the dry season,      especially in the arid West. The only way you can tell if      your stream or creek will flow year-round is to see it      flowing during the driest part of the summer, usually      August or September. Don't accept the word of a real-estate      agent that a creek never goes dry. If a creek is your only      year-round source of water, your activities will be limited      by the amount of water in it during its lowest period.    </p>    <p>      Check with the local farm advisor, health department or      U.S. Geological Survey office to see if the stream has ever      been gauged, or measured. Talk to other people who live      along the creek or stream to see what their experience has      been.    </p>    <p>      <em>Ponds.</em> You might be lucky and find a parcel of      land with a pond on it. If you do, find out the source of      the water that feeds it. If a creek or spring feeds the      pond, make sure the flow is sufficient to keep the pond      full year-round. If the pond is a good one, it is worth the      extra money you will pay for the land.    </p>    <p>      It is much more likely a real-estate agent will show you a      possible "pond site" rather than a pond. He might show you      some springs or creeks that could be used to feed a      man-made pond and tell you that the site has already been      researched. Never assume a pond can be built unless a      reliable source, such as a geologist, your local farm      advisor or a Soil Conservation Service agent, investigates      the site and determines its feasibility as a pond site.      Building a pond requires heavy-duty equipment, expensive      building materials and possibly a system to divert water to      the pond from a water source.    </p>    <p>      <em>Springs.</em> In many areas, springs are the primary      source of water. A spring occurs where water seeps to the      surface from a crack in the rock formation or where a road      cuts through a water vein. Artesian wells are like springs,      except that the water is forced up by underground pressure.      Often a spring will be only a tiny trickle of water coming      out of a hillside. Don't underestimate its value until you      measure its rate of flow. If a spring produces one gallon      of water a minute, which looks like a trickle, it produces      1,440 gallons every 24 hours. If you have a large holding      tank to collect the water as it flows to the surface, this      amount could support a small homestead. When you are      looking at land with springs, take along a gallon jar, and      measure the flow per minute using a watch with a second      hand. Multiply this amount by 60 to get the flow per hour,      then multiply that result by 24 to get the flow per day. Of      course, you will have to see the spring during the driest      part of the year to be certain that the flow is still      sufficient for your needs.    </p>    <p>      <em>Cisterns.</em> Cisterns are large circular or      rectangular storage tanks either completely open at the top      to collect rainwater or open only enough to allow a pipe to      enter and bring in water from roofs or fields. They are      made of cement, wood or metal. The collected water is      rarely used for drinking due to the possibility of      contamination. However, it can be used for swimming and      irrigation.    </p>    <p>      <em>Wells.</em> Eighty percent of rural water in the United      States comes from underground sources and is pumped to the      surface through wells. Underground water, or groundwater,      is preferred for drinking because it is purer than surface      water. Groundwater can be brought up at any point and thus      obtained close to where you need to use it. Because surface      water flows away swiftly and is subject to tremendous      evaporation, the fluctuation in a stream or creek varies      more than the steady supply of groundwater. The primary      difficulty with a well is the high cost of digging, casing      and sealing it and the necessity for a pump to bring the      water to the surface.    </p>        <p>      There are several different types of wells. The oldest is      the dug well (Fig. 1). Usually three to four feet in      diameter, it is dug with a pick and shovel to a maximum      depth of 50 feet. These wells are dangerous and painstaking      to dig, and they often go dry because they are so shallow.      Their main advantage is the large storage area, but this      permits contamination more easily than other wells because      of seepage through the well walls and from the large      opening on top. Dug wells are probably more common in      Canada these days than in the United States.    </p>    <p>      <em>Bored</em> wells are similar to dug wells except that      they are often deeper and smaller in diameter. An auger      bucket, either power- or hand-operated, is used to dig      these wells, which often run to 100 feet and are cased all      along the inside wall. The bored well is practically      obsolete today because of the more efficient driven and      drilled wells.    </p>    <p>      <em>Jetted</em> <em>or hydraulic</em> wells can be drilled      only in soft, sandy soils such as those found in some      coastal areas. The well is drilled by applying a      high-pressure stream of water that cuts through the earth      and washes it out of the hole. As this is done, a 1      1/2-inch pointed jetting tool is shoved down into the loose      sand as far as it will go, and when it stops the well is      complete. This method is useless if rock or clay is      reached.    </p>    <p>      To produce a churn, spud or percussion-tool well, a large      chisel-shaped bit is pounded into the ground over and over      again by lifting it high into the air and dropping it. With      each fall, the bit digs deeper into the ground. During this      process, water is poured into the developing hole to      transform the loosened dirt into mud, which is then drawn      out of the hole. It takes a long time to drill a well in      this manner, but it is still effectively done by commercial      drillers.    </p>        <p>      Drilled wells are the most common kind of wells being used      today. The drill has a sharp cutting bit on the end, and      the shaft is hollow. As the drill turns into the earth,      water is forced down into the drill stem, and the pressure      of the water sends the cut dirt and rock to the top of the      hole. As the drill goes deeper into the ground, additional      sections of stem are screwed on to increase the length of      the drill. (See Fig. 2.)    </p>    <p>      A <em>driven</em> well is usually cheaper to construct than      a drilled well. Pipe sections several feet long are screwed      together with a sharp well point and screen on one end. The      pointed end is pounded into the ground until it reaches      below the water-table level and a sufficient amount of      water can enter the well through the screen. The ground      must be quite soft to take a driven well, since hard rock      and clay cannot be penetrated. The depth is limited to a      maximum of 50 feet, and only a small flow of water will be      attained. As with all wells, a driven well may be cut into      the earth either horizontally or vertically. (See Fig. 3.)    </p>        <p>      If you look at land that has a well on it, you should ask      the seller to show you any records he has indicating the      amount of water pumped at various times of the year.      Examine his pumping setup to see if it is in good      condition. Does it need a new pump or motor? Ask him to      start up his pump and watch it operate for a few hours.      Does the well need to be dug deeper to get a larger flow to      meet your intended needs? Remember that the depth and size      of a well do not necessarily coincide with its capacity to      yield water.    </p>    <p>      Ask the seller what brand of pump he is using and what its      capacity is. How old is the equipment, and when was it      installed? Who drilled the well? Go to the well driller,      and ask to see the drilling log or driller's report to read      what information he has regarding the quality of the well      and its capacity. Sometimes a driller will not show you      this document without the owner's permission. If the seller      will not grant you permission to inspect the report, you      should be suspicious of the quality of the well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A drilled well can go to 1,000 feet, at a cost of      $15 per foot!</strong>    </p>    <h3>Well-Drilling Costs</h3>    <p>      The cost of drilling a new well is based on the depth of      the well in feet, the toughness of the earth, and the      accessibility to the area. The usual cost for drilling into      hard rock under normal conditions is $10 to $20 a foot,      although this figure could vary greatly depending on the      area and the competition among drillers. If you reach water      before hitting rock, the price is usually cut in half. A      drilled well can go to a depth of 1,000 feet. You can find      out the normal well depth in your area from the local well      driller and thus estimate the approximate cost to you. In      our area, wells are between 150 and 300 feet deep. At $15      per foot, a well can cost from $2,250 to $4,500.      Drilled-well construction includes lining the inside of the      well with a steel or plastic casing to protect it from      contamination and collapse, and pouring a concrete or grout      seal around the top.    </p>    <p>      It's important to remember that there is always a chance      you will not hit water. No driller is going to guarantee      water when he starts drilling. He just tells you his price      per foot and then drills until he hits water or you can't      afford to pay for another foot. You can pay several      thousand dollars for a dry hole, and that is one of the      biggest risks of buying country land. Even in areas where      water is plentiful, drilling is successful only about 85%      of the time. The people representing the other 15% are      simply out of luck and money. You must be certain there is      water before you buy.    </p>    <h3>Evaluating Underground Water</h3>    <p>      <em><br /></em> Ninety percent of all water beneath the      surface of the ground occurs in the top 200 feet, and the      average depth of all domestic water wells in the United      States is slightly less than 50 feet.    </p>    <p>      Groundwater exists only in the area called the <em>zone of      saturation</em> . This is the area beneath the ground in      which all the openings and pores in the soil, sand, gravel      or rock are filled with water. Developing a well involves      drilling a hole into the zone of saturation, which allows      water to drain by gravity from the saturated earth into the      well, where it is pumped up to the surface and replaced by      other water flowing toward the well. The rate at which this      new water moves into the well, called the recharge rate,      determines the amount that can be withdrawn at any one      time. Thus you will want to know not only if there is      underground water present but also its quantity and rate of      flow. The total groundwater in an area is replenished every      year by new precipitation, which controls the amount of      water present in the zone of saturation. It is estimated      that 95% of the total fresh water available is groundwater.    </p>    <p>      One method used to locate underground water is to find      those plants, called phreatophytes, that exist only when      their root systems can reach the water table. (The name      <em>phreatophyte</em> is derived from two Greek words      meaning "well plant.") Some phreatophytes indicate not only      the presence of groundwater but also the quality and      approximate depth of the water below the surface. For      instance, in arid regions willows or cottonwood trees, as      well as elderberry shrubs (Fig. 4) and rabbit-brush (Fig.      5), usually mean that good water is available within 10 to      20 feet of the surface. Some species of birch, maple,      sycamore, alder, bay and live oak also indicate groundwater      at shallow depths. Mesquite (Fig. 6) suggests good water      within 10 to 50 feet of the surface, and black greasewood      (Fig. 7) indicates mineralized water within 10 to 40 feet.    </p>        <p>      Unfortunately, the value of such plants as indicators is      reduced in humid regions where there is an abundance of      water in the soil. Each area of the country has its own      phreatophytes. Your local well driller, farm advisor,      agriculture experiment station or other advisory agency      will know the ones to look for in your area.    </p>    <p>      Another ancient method still used to find water is      <em>witching</em> , or <em>dowsing</em> , with a divining      stick or rod. As far back as the sixteenth century, farmers      walked across their land carrying a forked branch in front      of them waiting for it to point down to the ground over a      water source. A forked or straight twig from a peach,      willow, hickory, dogwood or cherry tree is the most common      tool used by diviners. The twig is held between both hands      facing out and up and is supposed to roll down or spin      around when held over water. Almost every rural area has      its well known diviners. Some work for free, and others      charge a fee for their divining services. Some claim to be      able to tell which way the water flows and how deep it is      by the movement of the divining rod. However, the U.S.      Geological Survey has concluded that not one scientifically      conducted experiment using water witches to locate optimal      sites for water-well location has ever yielded conclusive,      reproducible support for water witches' claims. I would not      buy land solely on the basis of their findings, but they      might confirm some other appraisals made by a well digger      or farm advisor.    </p>    <p>      <strong>In farming communities,</strong> <strong>nitrates      from fertilizers may pollute the groundwater.</strong>    </p>    <h3>Is the Water Drinkable?</h3>    <p>      If water is declared potable by the county health      department, it is safe to drink. The safety is determined      by examining the water at your source and the conditions      around it. You will probably not be surprised to know that      animal manure and soil bacteria are usually harmful to a      water supply. Human sewage and poisonous sprays are the      primary causes of contaminated water.    </p>    <p>      In heavily fertilized areas, such as farming communities,      nitrates from decomposed ammonia fertilizer infiltrate the      groundwater and pollute it. Nitrate-rich water leads to a      serious disease in infants known as blue babies      (methemoglobinemia).    </p>    <p>      Animal feedlots provide a huge volume of waste compared      with their size. For example, a 10-acre feedlot with 1,000      head of cattle produces waste equivalent to that of a town      of 6,000 people. If you are considering buying in a farming      or livestock area, always have the available drinking water      tested before you purchase property there.    </p>    <p>      If you are looking at land that is in a floodplain, and if      there are several other homes in that floodplain that use      septic tanks and wells, it is very possible that the      effluent from the septic tanks will pollute the      groundwater. Check with the local health officials to see      if there are periodic outbreaks of hepatitis due to an      increase in coliform bacteria during times of high water.    </p>    <p>      Drinking or smelling water will tell you nothing about its      portability, since even clear, good-tasting water may be      contaminated. However, your local county health or      sanitation department will gladly conduct a free or      inexpensive water analysis for you. A health inspector will      come out to collect the sample and to examine the source      and surrounding area.    </p>    <p>      The basic water test includes a coliform bacterial count,      which reflects the amount of human and other      warm-blooded-animal excreta in it. If you want a more      complete mineral and bacterial analysis, which is not      usually necessary, you will have to pay to have it done by      a commercial laboratory.    </p>    <p>      I recommend that you always get the basic water test done,      no matter what the history of the drinking water on the      land. The family living there may have been drinking the      water for 50 years, but pollution can occur virtually      overnight.    </p>    <p>      You might also want to check the surrounding area for other      forms of groundwater pollution, especially if there are any      industries located in your area. More and more we are      finding that toxic substances have been improperly stored      and are leaking into the groundwater.    </p>    <h3>The Water Supply System</h3>    <p>      If you are looking at undeveloped land, you must determine      its suitability for a water supply system. The water supply      system is the means by which you get the water from its      source to your house, garden, trees, fields and animals.      The standard equipment includes pipe or hose, one or more      holding tanks, a pump house and various pieces of hardware      such as valves and faucets. If you are looking at land that      already has a developed water system, you will want to know      if it was well designed and built and if it is still      working properly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A bath can consume as much as 40 gallons, a shower,      30.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Setting up a new system can cost thousands of dollars.      Before you buy land, estimate the costs required to develop      a new water system or repair an existing one. If the      expense is beyond your means, do not purchase the land.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gravity-Flow System.</strong> The cheapest and      easiest way to bring water where you need it is by using      the force of gravity. To do this the water source must be      higher in elevation than the place to which you want to      bring the water, so that when you lay your hose or pipe the      water will flow freely of its own accord to the lower      point. However, because air is lighter than water, the hose      between the two points must drop steadily downhill, or air      bubbles will collect in the high spots of the hose and slow      down or stop the flow of water. If you cannot avoid laying      the hose over a high spot, you can prevent air from      entering it by putting in valves for bleeding the lines or      by keeping both ends of the hose constantly submerged in      water.    </p>    <p>      If a hill is situated above a building site but you cannot      find a spring or other water source in it, you might      consider drilling a horizontal well into the side of the      hill to get water to flow without using a pump. Ask a well      driller to appraise the possibility of finding water this      way on land you might buy.    </p>    <p>      The only materials needed to set up a gravity-flow water      system are a holding tank, which might be a spring box,      lake, pond or dammed-up portion of a creek; the necessary      pipe or hose; storage tanks; and various valves, faucets      and other hardware. This system is the cheapest and easiest      to maintain because no pump is necessary.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Siphon System.</strong> The siphon system is      similar to the gravity-flow system in that the source must      be higher than the point to which you eventually want to      bring the water. However, any rise in the ground that is      higher than the source requires siphoning to get the water      to flow over it. This is done by sucking the water up over      the rise and far enough down the other side so that it      begins to flow of its own accord. As long as you don't lose      the siphon, the water will continue to flow. Every time the      siphon is broken by air getting into the hose, you must      suck the water to get it going again. You can use the same      methods to prevent air from entering the hose as you would      use in the gravity-flow system. The difference between      these two systems is that in a pure gravity-flow system,      none of the high spots in the hose are higher than the      source, so no sucking is required to start the system.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pump System.</strong> Unless you are fortunate      enough to have a source positioned so that the water will      flow by a gravity or siphon system, you will need a pump.      The most common pump used for shallow wells and      surface-water sources is the gasoline-powered centrifugal      pump which sucks water up and pushes it out with great      force. A two-horsepower pump of this type can suck the      water to a height of only about 20 feet. However, if you      can place the pump at the source, say along a stream or      pond, it can push the water several hundred feet up a bank      or hill.    </p>    <p>      If your source of water is a deep well, you will need an      electric pump. The one-horsepower electric jet pump can      suck up water from a maximum depth of 110 feet. However,      the electric submersible well pump is more commonly used      today. It is a long cylindrical pump that is placed at the      bottom of the well, and it can push water up 450 feet. A      one-horsepower submersible pump can push 10.2 gallons of      water per minute up from 220 feet down.    </p>    <p>      Since these pumps require electricity, you will have to      either bring it in or supply it by means of a generator.      The most common generators are powered by gasoline or      diesel fuel. There are also wind generators that look like      windmills, and they produce electricity that recharges a      set of storage batteries. If wind conditions are suitable,      you can run an electric pump using this system without the      noise and pollution of a gas or diesel generator. You can      also use a windmill to pump water directly from a source      straight down, like a well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Holding Tanks.</strong> Unless you have a lake,      pond or other large natural body of water situated higher      than your homestead area, you will need at least one      holding tank in your water system to keep a large quantity      of water available. The greater your water needs, the      larger the tank will have to be. If you want to irrigate an      orchard and garden or grazing fields for your animals, you      will need a large tank. For instance, if you plan to have a      half-acre garden, it will require the equivalent of one      inch of rain, or about 11,350 gallons, every 10 days. If      you want to water once every five days, you will need a      tank that holds at least 5,675 gallons just to water your      garden once.    </p>    <p>      If there is a holding tank on the land, determine its      capacity to be sure it is large enough for your intended      needs. To figure out the volume in cubic feet of a      cylindrical tank, multiply the area of the base in feet by      its height in feet. (The formula is 3.1416 x r 2 x h, where      r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the      tank.) The volume in cubic feet of a square or rectangular      tank is figured by multiplying the length times the width      times the height in feet. Once you get the volume in cubic      feet, you have to transform the result into gallons.To do      this, multiply the number of cubic feet by 7.4805, which is      the number of gallons in one cubic foot. For example,      assume you have a cylindrical tank with the following      dimensions: The height is 10 feet, and the diameter of the      base is 12 feet. Thus the radius is six feet. Plugging      these numbers into the formula, we get 3.1416 x 6 2 x      10=3.1416 x 36 x 10 = 3.1416 x 360 = 1,130.98 cubic feet.      To translate this figure into gallons of water, multiply      1,130.98 x 7.4805 = 8,460.30 gallons.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ideally, you'll have</strong> <strong>a water      supply guarantee in the Contract of Sale.</strong>    </p>    <h3>Buyer Beware</h3>    <p>      Your land can have the most beautiful view in the world,      but without water it is basically useless. Never buy land      without a written guarantee that a year-round source of      water exists that is sufficient to meet your needs. If the      water dries up after you buy the property, the seller will      be liable for a breach of this warranty.    </p>    <p>      If a visible water source exists on the land, include a      clause in the Contract of Sale such as this one: "The      Seller warrants and represents that as of the close of      escrow the property will include a spring, well, creek or      other water supply with a year-round output of at      least_____gallons per_____."<br />    </p>    <p>      If no water source presently exists on the land, you'll      want to have at least a test drilling and preferably a      completed, productive well drilled before, not after, you      finalize your purchase. The ideal situation is to have the      seller pay to drill the well, by including a clause in the      Contract of Sale such as this: "The Seller shall make a      diligent effort to locate and develop a year-round adequate      water supply for the buyer's needs on the property. If      necessary, the Seller shall drill a well to a maximum depth      of________. The water supply must have a year-round output      of at least'________ per minute. If the Seller cannot      locate and develop an adequate water supply, then this      agreement shall be terminated immediately, and all funds      deposited and paid by the Buyer shall be returned      immediately, and the Buyer shall suffer no further      liability under this agreement."    </p>    <p>      If he locates a good water supply, he can add the price of      the well to the purchase price. If he cannot locate water,      you will not have to proceed with the purchase. If the      seller resists such a condition, you can offer a compromise      by agreeing to pay for half the drilling costs even if no      water is found on the land. You should not agree to pay the      entire cost if no water is found since, if you do, you      could spend a few thousand dollars drilling a dry well on      land you do not own.    </p>    <p>      Remember: Water is essential; without it, land is virtually      worthless. Always take the time to examine property      thoroughly for water sources, and carefully evaluate its      potential for adequate water systems. Get a written      guarantee that a dependable and adequate water supply      exists. Then, and only then, you can proceed to purchase      the land, confident that your homestead's water needs will      be met.    </p>    <p>      Editor's Note: This article is excerpted from Finding and      Buying Your Place in the Country, by Les and Carol Scher, a      book long considered the most comprehensive and      authoritative guide to purchasing rural property.
