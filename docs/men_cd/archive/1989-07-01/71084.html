                    <h5 id="byline">      by CAROL TAYLOR    </h5>        <p>      <strong>L</strong> ET'S FACE IT: GOURMET backpacking is an      oxymoron. When you're bereft of running water, four-burner      stove, refrigerator and Cuisinart, when everything you eat      and everything you cook with must be carried on your back      for miles, you make some compromises with taste and      nutrition. Fresh tomatoes may taste better than sun-dried,      but they weigh a ton and turn to pulp in a backpack. Rolled      oats may provide more fiber than instant ones, but the      latter require only that you add boiling water to your      Sierra cup-no stirring over a stove that gulps the      fuel you've packed in, no pot to clean. On a cold dawn with      10 miles of trail in front of you, these things matter.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you don't have to subsist on hardtack and jerky,      either.    </p>    <h3>Function, Not Form</h3>    <p>      It's partly a matter of definition. If you shop for      "camping food," you're limited to an outdoor store's      collection of freeze-dried dinners. You'll eat better if      you fill your pack with food that meets a few basic      criteria, however it's labeled and wherever you find it:      outdoor store, supermarket, deli, natural foods store,      ethnic market or your own pantry and garden.    </p>    <p>      <em>1. Lightweight.</em> Weight is one reason backpackers      obsess about dehydrated food; water is heavy. Compare a cup      of dry milk powder to an equivalent quart of milk.    </p>    <p>      The standard goal is to carry two pounds of food per person      per day. Clearly, the longer the trip, the more critical      the weight of the food-and the      containers-becomes. Short treks allow a few fresh      vegetables and small cans.    </p>    <p>      <em>2. Nutritious.</em> Even moderate backpacking is      strenuous work, raising your daily nutritional needs by a      good 1,000 calories. Really tough going requires more.      Although many hikers eat more than usual and still return      home minus a few pounds, the wilderness is a good place to      have your wits about you and a bad place to diet. Feeling      weak and dragged out will dull your judgment and your      enjoyment.    </p>    <p>      <em>3. Quick, tasty and easy to prepare.</em> Come evening,      you're gonna be tired and hungry. And with only a      one-burner camping stove, the number of pans always      matters.    </p>    <p>      <em>4. Long keeping.</em> A frozen steak in a zip-top bag      will thaw in your backpack in time for dinner the first      night. Frozen precooked chicken will keep in the cool      center of your pack for the second evening. After that,      you'll need food that requires no refrigeration-which      is the other advantage of dried food.    </p>    <h3>Breakfast</h3>        <p>      When breakfast is hurried, perhaps eaten in the dark      because a long, hard hike looms ahead, quick and easy foods      are mandatory: commercial or homemade granola bars, filling      cold cereal or, perhaps most satisfying, quick hot      cereal-individual packets of instant oatmeal or any      of the quick-cooking cereals on the market. Dried fruit,      either straight from the bag or soaked in water overnight,      and the best tea, freeze-dried coffee or cocoa mix on the      market round out the meal.    </p>    <p>      Then again, there's no reason not to have smoked salmon and      bagels, if you prefer.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hearty Camp Cereal.</em> At home, combine 1/3 cup quick      oats, 1 tablespoon wheat germ, 2 teaspoons toasted      sunflower seeds, 2 tablespoons dried fruit (raisins,      snipped apricots, chopped dates, banana chips, etc.), 1      teaspoon brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and dry milk      equal to 1 cup reconstituted. Pack in plastic bags. In      camp, place cereal in cup or bowl, cover with boiling      water, and stir until soft.    </p>    <p>      On leisurely mornings, unpack your envelopes of      just-add-water pancake mix-flavors range from      blueberry to buckwheat-and a tiny bottle of syrup or      jam. In fact, any baking mix, made into a thinnish batter,      can be cooked in pancake form: muffin mix (a kaleidoscope      of flavors), coffee cake, corn bread, even gingerbread      (also good for an evening dessert). Make one large pancake      in your skillet, and then slice it into wedges.    </p>    <h3>Lunch</h3>    <p>      Although some hikers unpack their stove and prepare a hot      lunch, most just rummage around in their backpacks.    </p>    <p>      <em>Cheese.</em> Calorie dense, protein rich, long keeping,      cheese is an ideal travel food: Swiss, Gouda, Edam,      Havarti, Monterey Jack. And freshly ground Parmesan or      Romano jazzes up a bland dinner.    </p>    <p>      <em>Nut butters and crackers.</em> No one knows why hikers      can eat peanut butter and crackers day after day with      continued serenity, but they can. Still, you might as well      branch out; take cashew or almond butter as well. Crackers      must be sturdy (a backpack rivals a blender at turning      saltines into crumbs), but there's still a dizzying array      of hearty, whole-grain choices.    </p>    <p>      <em>Sausage.</em> Dry, dense sausages-salami, pepperoni,      beef sticks, Thuringer, summer sausage, Spanish      chorizo-keep well, taste wonderful at high noon and      enliven a dinner of pasta or rice.    </p>    <p>      <em>Compact breads.</em> The sturdier kinds travel well:      dense "cocktail" breads (pumpernickel and rye), English      muffins, bagels, tortillas and pitas.    </p>    <p>      <em>Fresh foods.</em> Unless your trip is so long that you      can't afford one extra ounce, do take along a few hardy      fruits and vegetables: carrots, celery, cucumbers, fennel,      apples, kiwi.    </p>    <h3>Dinner</h3>    <p>      Hot soup staves off hunger until the main meal is ready,      helps fill the hiker's prodigious need for liquids and      soothes the soul. These days, dried soups in packable foil      envelopes line the supermarket shelves: tomato basil,      minestrone, asparagus, cauliflower, hot and sour, mushroom,      vegetable, French onion. Most require only water and two      minutes' cooking time. Repackage those that call for milk:      Pour the mix in a plastic bag, and add the equivalent      amount of dry milk powder; then stir in boiling water at      the campsite.    </p>    <p>      Traditionally, the main course is a one-dish meal based on      complex carbohydrates, with added protein and seasonings.      Food manufacturers can help. Markets stock various      quick-cooking boxed dinners composed of a starch (rice,      pasta, couscous) and dried additions such as cheese,      vegetables and sauce-everything from macaroni and      cheese to noodles Stroganoff, from Creole rice to tabbouleh      salad. Add some of your luncheon cheese or sausage, or some      canned meat or fish, and you've got a quick and easy meal.      Or you can carry your own rice and pasta and season it with      one of the dry sauce mixes available. Most require only      water; some need milk (add dry milk and repackage). Choose      from curry, pepper, mushroom, white, hunter, Newburg,      hollandaise, lemon dill, b√©arnaise, gravy (brown,      chicken, turkey), clam, pesto and Alfredo.    </p>    <p>      Or you can wing it. Take along a few starches, some      portable protein and your favorite seasonings, and toss      them in the pot with a practiced hand. Some of the great      cuisines of the world-Italian, Spanish, Mexican,      Middle Eastern-are based on exactly this principle,      and their rice and pasta dishes can be transported into the      wilderness in recognizable form.    </p>    <p>      You might pack along:    </p>    <p>      <em>Starches:</em> rice (quick white or brown); pasta      (whole-wheat or vegetable spaghetti or macaroni, egg or      ramen noodles); grains (couscous, bulgur, quick barley).    </p>    <p>      Protein: In addition to the cheese and sausage you're      carrying, try smoked fish, chipped beef, canned fish (tuna,      clams, shrimp, oysters, sardines, crab), canned meats      (boned chicken, turkey, corned beef) and, yes, jerky.    </p>    <p>      <em>Seasonings:</em> If you're inclined toward Mexican and      Spanish meals, take dried tomatoes, tomato paste (more      condensed and thus lighter than sauce; pack it in a plastic      tube available at outdoor stores), fresh garlic, onion      flakes, herbs-cumin, coriander, saffron, dried red chilies,      dried green chilies, all packed in tiny plastic bags singly      or in combination-pine nuts, dried shrimp, chorizo      (small and spicy sausages, available at Latin markets) and      packets of chicken-broth-and-seasoning mix.    </p>    <p>      If your tastes run to the Italian, try tomato paste, grated      Parmesan or Romano, fresh garlic, dried mushrooms, shallots      (compact substitutes for both onion and garlic), dried      tomatoes, olive oil. (Liquids carry well in plastic bottles      from outdoor stores or in 35-mm film canisters.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Extras:</em> Tuck some of your favorite flourishes into      empty corners of your backpack: herbs and spices-dry      mustard, thyme, curry powder, cinnamon/nutmeg -soy sauce,      sherry, vermouth, honey, Worcestershire, brandy (for      soaking the dried fruit).    </p>    <p>      Clearly, the possibilities are infinite-including these two      modest examples.    </p>    <p>      <em>Mexican One-Step.</em> Measure quick-cooking rice and      water into the pan. Then toss in a packet of      chicken-flavored broth and seasoning, some dried tomatoes,      a little tomato paste, some cumin, onion flakes, dried      chilies and sliced chorizo or other sausage. If you're      tired of sausage, use a can of chicken, crab, clams or      shrimp. Stir, and simmer until done. Pasta Alfredo. Boil      pasta in water until almost done.    </p>    <p>      Drain, and remove pasta from the pan. Add a little water to      the pan, sprinkle in some dry milk and ample amounts of      grated Parmesan and Swiss cheese cut into small chunks.      Stir carefully over a low flame until the cheese melts as      much as it's likely to. Return the pasta to the pot, and      stir until coated and hot. Sprinkle with black pepper, and      serve. Note: As soon as you empty the pot, fill it with      water and put it on to heat.    </p>    <p>      Otherwise, it will be a humdinger to clean.    </p>    <p>      For a wealth of information and ideas about camp cooking      see June Fleming's    </p>    <p>      The Well-Fed Backpacker    </p>    <p>      (Random House, 1986, $6.95).    </p>
