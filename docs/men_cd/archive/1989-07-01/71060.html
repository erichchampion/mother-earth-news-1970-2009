            <p><strong>TO YOUR      HEALTH</strong></p>			       <p>"Eating on the run" may be      more unhealthy than was previously thought.</p><p> Lyme is on the      rise, and it can be carried by fleas on pets.    </p>        <p>      Recent research has made that old adage, You are what you      eat, seem to be much more than a tired clich√©. Here      are just a few items from the food front (as well as the      latest update on Lyme disease), as reported by the editors      of American Health, a magazine that stays on top of the      latest in medical research, separates fad from fact and      helps you preserve and improve life's most precious gift      your good health.    </p>        <h3>The Eat-More Diet</h3><p>Can you actually lower      your cholesterol level without giving up red meat, dairy      foods or eggs? "Yes," says Rita Dougherty, R.D., of the      USDA's Western Human Nutrition Research Center in San      Francisco. Chances are that you'll lose weight, too, while      getting more vitamins and minerals than ever before.</p><p>For 40      days, seven men with an average blood cholesterol of 218      and an average blood pressure of 135/85 (both higher than      ideal) were allowed to eat the same number of calories as      they normally did, but instead of getting between 40 and      44% of those calories from fat and downing an average of      600 mg of cholesterol a day, they got only 25% of the      calories from fat and only 300 mg of cholesterol. To      accomplish this, fat was trimmed from all meats, skin was      removed from all fowl, margarine replaced butter, skim milk      replaced whole, and vegetable oil was used instead of      animal cooking fats. Since carbohydrates and proteins have      less than half the calories of fat, the men ate more food      to keep calories the same, but it was in the form of      grains, vegetables and fruits. By the end of the study,      their average blood cholesterol dropped to 185 and average      blood pressure to 124/79.</p><h3>A Cup of      Infertility</h3><p>A study recently completed by the      National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences      indicates that women who consume more than one cup of      coffee daily (or its caffeine equivalent) are only half as      likely to get pregnant per menstrual cycle as those who      drink less. The good news is, the effects may be quickly      reversed. Only caffeine consumed during the three months      before the study began was found to be a factor in its      results.</p><p> Dr. Allen Wilcox, the epidemiologist who headed      the study, noted that genetic differences in metabolizing      caffeine could also lead to differences in susceptibility:      "There were women in our study who were very heavy caffeine      drinkers and yet conceived right away." Other women, he      says, might be adversely affected by far smaller amounts.      His advice? "If a woman has been trying to get pregnant for      several months, she ought to know that scientists have      noted some connection between caffeine and fertility. Then      she should make her own judgment."    </p>    <h3>      Tofu for Tummies    </h3>    <p>      In preliminary studies at the Veterans Administration      Medical Center in Dallas, researchers have found that when      healthy people eat soy protein, they produce 30 to 40% less      stomach acid than when they eat the same amount of beef      protein. It's too early to tell whether this effect holds      true for a real world mixed meal, but the results are      intriguing enough to encourage the scientists to continue      their work.    </p>    <h3>      Good Vibes, Good Digestion    </h3>    <p>      When it comes to digestion, how you eat may be almost as      important as what you eat. And that should concern us,      because poor digestion may lead to a wide range of      maladies, from ulcers to diverticulitis to colon cancer.</p><p>      Dental professor and nutritionist Donald R. Morse of the      Temple University School of Dentistry in Philadelphia has      found that the best digestion can be achieved by coupling      deep relaxation with thorough chewing, and that "eating on      the run" may be even more unhealthy than was previously      realized. In his studies, not only did digestion occur more      rapidly during relaxation periods, but greater amounts of      the sugar maltose (produced when a complex carbohydrate is      broken down during chewing) were present at those times.      Chewing for a full minute also increased maltose levels      more than chewing for 20 seconds, but not as dramatically      as did deep relaxation.</p><p> "The digestion that occurs in the      mouth is a good barometer for the digestive process going      on in the rest of the body," explains Morse. "After all, it      all starts in the mouth, chemically and mechanically."    </p>    <h3>      Osteoporosis Breakthrough    </h3>    <p>      For the first time there's evidence that an experimental      drug treatment can actually build new bone mass and halt      the progress of spinal osteoporosis. Approximately 5      million Americans suffer with this form of osteoporosis,      which thins the bones in the spine and causes crush      fractures and stooped posture.</p><p>The new drug      therapy-calcium citrate and a time-release version of      sodium fluoride-was tested in a government-funded study      headed by Dr. Charles Pak of the University of Texas      Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. According to Dr.      Pak, the treatment restored lost bone mass at rates of up      to 6% a year and reduced dramatically the tiny spinal      fractures that plague those suffering from this condition.</p><p>      If all goes well, he says, the slow-release drug will win      the approval of the Food and Drug Administration within the      next two years.    </p>    <h3>      Smoker's "High"    </h3>    <p>      If you're a smoker, another way to lower your cholesterol      level is to quit. Researchers at the American Health      Foundation have found that every cigarette raises total      cholesterol half a point on the average. People of all ages      (excluding postmenopausal women) who smoke 30 cigarettes a      day have cholesterol levels 15 to 20 points higher than      nonsmokers. (Hormone shifts after menopause normally raise      cholesterol levels in postmenopausal women, including      nonsmokers, so researchers couldn't make firm conclusions      for that group.)</p><p> Precisely how cigarette smoking alters      cholesterol levels is as yet unclear, but smoking may alter      levels of sex hormones that have an effect on serum      cholesterol. However, if you give up tobacco, levels soon      come down.    </p>    <h3>      The Latest on Lyme Disease    </h3>    <p>      And it's not good! Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria,      responsible for Lyme, are on the rise in humans and animals      and are becoming an international problem. This disease,      which starts out with flulike symptoms, but which can lead      to arthritis, serious nerve and heart damage and even      miscarriage and birth defects, is currently reported in 43      states even in some in which the white-tailed deer (and the      Ixodes dammini ticks they carry) never roam. Among the      animals now shown to harbor Lyme bacteria are raccoons,      opossums, dogs, rabbits, horses, cattle, migrating birds      and even mosquitoes and flies. (The white-footed mouse has      long been implicated as a tick carrier, and at least one      person in Texas and another in Wisconsin may have been      infected by bites from cat carried fleas.)</p><p>Some wildlife      biologists are thought to have contracted the disease after      coming in contact with the blood of slain deer that      harbored Lyme bacteria, and it's possible that owners of      horses or cows could become infected by inadvertent contact      with the animals' urine. (One study of Wisconsin dairy      farmers found that 46% had been exposed to Lyme, while a      study of dogs in Suffolk County, New York, found that 65%      had been exposed to Lyme bacteria-and fleas that bite      infected pets can ultimately pass the organism on to      people.)</p><p>In California, more than 400 people have      contracted Lyme disease, apparently after having been      bitten by another type of tick, Ixodes pacificus, found on      birds, lizards, rodents and other mammals. Investigators      say there's also evidence that both biting flies and      mosquitoes are spreading Lyme disease in Europe.</p><p>What's      more, you can have contracted Lyme disease without ever      getting the typical bull's-eye rash, so be alert for      chills, fever and other flulike symptoms. Weeks or even      months after becoming infected, some people experience      severe headaches, muscle pain, facial paralysis, abnormal      heart rhythms and inflammation of the heart wall and      surrounding sac. To know for sure if the disease is      present, you need a blood test that detects an antibody to      the Lyme bacterium. The test is notoriously inaccurate      during the first few weeks after infection, so you might      need a retest; learning the results, however, can take      days. Fast, accurate assays are still in the works.</p><p>Lyme      disease, if caught early, is often easily cured with      antibiotics. Later on, treatment might require massive      doses of intravenous antibiotics. Even then, a small number      of patients don't respond to treatment, possibly because      the bacteria are able to hide in nerve cells and perhaps      able to enter a dormant stage.</p><p>For prevention, wear      long-sleeved shirts and long pants (tucked into socks) when      in wooded areas and, afterwards, check for pinpoint specks      on clothes (ticks show up best on white). In a high-risk      area, consider using an insect repellent that contains DEET      <em>(N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide)</em> on clothes and      exposed areas, especially arms and hands. (Make sure it      contains no more than 50% DEET for adults and 20% for      children, and use it sparingly for only a day or two at a      time.) Immediately remove any ticks on your skin with      sharp-pointed tweezers. Grab as close to the skin as      possible, and pull straight out. Treat tick bites with a      topical antiseptic, and watch, for the next few weeks, for      signs of Lyme. Make sure outside pets have flea and tick      collars, and inspect animals after outings. Also, avoid any      animal's blood, urine and feces (good advice in general),      especially if you have a cut, scratch, sore or other open      wound.    </p>
