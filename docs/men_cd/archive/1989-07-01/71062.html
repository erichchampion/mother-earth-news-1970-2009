            		<p>				<strong>KITCHEN      GARDEN</strong>		</p>		        <p class="caption">      Nutrition in crispy pods.    </p>		<h5 id="byline">      By Sara Pacher    </h5>        <p><strong>      MANY YOUNG CHILDREN</strong> learn to dread the same parental      liturgy: "Eat your beans; they're good for you." But that      wasn't the case with my two-year-old son. Nothing made him      happier than a plastic cup stuffed with whole cooked beans.      Clutching the container to his chest, he'd set off on his      little adventures, munching bean pods as if they were      pretzel sticks.</p><p> And I couldn't have been more pleased with      his choice of snack, because, even when cooked, both green      and yellow (or wax) beans are extremely low in fat and      contain wholesome amounts of potassium and vitamins A, B 1      B 2 and C, as well as some phosphorus, calcium and iron.      Along with nutrition comes culinary versatility. Snap      beans, whose flavor complements that of many other      homegrown vegetables, can be transformed into salads,      soups, stews and a multitude of side dishes and casseroles.    </p>        <p>      Beans are, in fact, the third most commonly grown garden      vegetable in the United States, outranked only by tomatoes      and peppers. And no wonder! They thrive in nearly every      section of the country, tolerate soils that range from      sandy to clay, and produce an abundant crop in around 50      days. Finally, bean plants-with their butterflylike      blossoms in shades of red, pink or white-are downright      pretty. When early explorers first returned home with these      natives of Central and South America, Europeans used them      not as food crops but as ornamentals.</p><p>All beans-as      well as many other plants, including peas-belong to the      Leguminosae family. An important benefit of legumes is      nitrogen fixation: Bacteria in the root nodules of most      legumes convert nitrogen in the air into a form usable by      the plants. If the roots are left in the ground after the      tops are removed (or plowed under), the nitrogen also      enriches the soil.</p><h3>What to Plant</h3>        <p>      Snap beans <em>(Phaseolus      vulgaris)</em> are known by various other names: green      beans, wax beans, haricots verts and string beans, although      the last term is not nearly as accurate as it was prior to      the development of a stringless variety in the 1890s. Such      beans should be picked while they are still very tender,      and their name comes from the sound made by the crisp pods      as they are taken from the vine or broken. The young beans      require a minimum of cooking and are often served whole.</p><p>      Snap beans are available either as bush varieties, to be      planted in rows or beds, or as pole beans, whose twining      vines require support in the form of poles, strings, wires      or trellises. Though the bean quality is the same, bush      beans make a faster start, grow for a shorter period, and      are harvested sooner than poles. However, while the pole      beans are slower to mature, they produce a heavy crop in a      limited space and also bear, longer, so they are ideal for      a small garden. All snap beans are grown as annuals in this      country.</p><p>Many people use the term <em>runner bean</em> to      mean any pole bean, but the runner is a different species,      being wider and somewhat "fuzzy," and requiring cooler      growing conditions. Runners need to be cooked much longer      than young snap beans, and therefore are good for simmering      in casseroles.</p><p> Snap beans (and runners) are thus grown for      their pods. Raised for the actual bean are shell      beans-lima, broad (or fava), red kidney, navy, soy      and other dried beans-but they deserve an article all      their own and will be covered in a future issue.</p><p>But even      limiting a list to snap beans leaves literally hundreds of      varieties to choose from. Medium green Top-crop (49 days)      and light green Bountiful (47 days; a good choice for      canning) are among the early bush beans. Rich green Blue      Lake (56 days), whose six-to seven-inch pods are perfect      for canning and freezing, is a longtime favorite. Breeders      have used this variety to create a large number of      dependable Blue Lake hybrids, and all such Blue      Lakes-along with Astro (53 days), Contender (53      days), Tender green (57 days), Tendercrop (53 days; good      for cooking whole) and Greencrop (50 days; with six-inch      pods popular for French slicing)-are available as      bush types that are resistant to bean mosaic virus, a      common bean disease.</p><p>Disease-resistant pole beans include      McCaslan (65 days) and a climbing version of Blue Lake (65      days). Though lacking this protection, other popular pole      bean varieties are Kentucky Wonder (65 days), Kentucky      Wonder Wax (68 days) and the heavily yielding Romano (66      days), which produces tender, meaty beans until frost.      Another bean that's well worth cultivating despite its lack      of disease resistance (and its unruly growth habits) is the      old-fashioned white half runner so favored by gardeners in      the Southeast. It bears a bit later than other beans and      isn't the easiest variety to grow, but if a crop is      successful, the plants, when picked regularly, produce      abundantly for weeks, and the "beany-tasting" pods remain      extremely flavorful when canned or frozen. Most half      runners require some support, but not as much as regular      pole beans. For a more exotic variety, try the yard-long      bean, whose rampant vines can produce three-foot-long pods,      though they taste best at a tender 12 to 15 inches.</p><p>Since      beans are self-pollinating, two cultivars can be grown side      by side without much danger of cross-pollination. However,      if you're a seed saver, you should probably separate      different varieties by at least 50 feet, with a barrier      crop between.    </p>    <h3>      How to Grow    </h3>    <p>      Two things are essential to produce an optimum crop of snap      beans: a sheltered, sunny spot and well-drained soil. If      the earth is too soggy or too cold, the bean seeds will rot      in the ground. Wait to plant, therefore, until the soil and      the air (even the nights) warm up. Prior to that, fork in a      medium amount of powdery compost and aged manure, but go      easy on any soil amendments that contain a lot of nitrogen,      as an excess produces leaves instead of blossoms and beans.      A bean patch planted in fertile loam probably won't need      additional fertilizer. Ideally, the soil should be just      slightly acid, having a pH range of between 6 and 7.      Lighten heavy clay by working in peat, coarse sand or extra      compost.</p><p>Since most bush varieties produce the bulk of      their crop over a two-week period, you can insure a      continual harvest by staggering plantings at two-week      intervals until around 60 days before fall's first killing      frost. Roughly speaking, two ounces of seed will grow about      20 to 25 pounds of beans. Ten bushbean plants per person      should provide an excess to freeze or can.</p><p>Once the soil      has warmed up, sow single seeds of bush beans two inches      apart in rows two feet apart (three feet if you plan to      cultivate with a garden tiller). Drop a few at the end of      the row, and transplant the resultant seedlings into spaces      where seeds don't germinate. (Some people soak their beans      overnight before planting, but this can cause them to      crack. And some gardeners dust the seeds with an inoculant      powder when planting in a new site, but this isn't      absolutely necessary.) Place the seeds approximately one      inch deep in heavy soil; one and one-half inches deep in      light soil. Increase the depth about one-half inch for      summer plantings, but don't plant so deep that the sprouts      can't push up through the earth.</p><p>It's said that beans      thrive when grown near carrots and cauliflower but are      stunted by garlic and onions. Potatoes and beans are a      classic combination, as each repels the pests that attack      the other. Lettuce intercropped with beans helps protect      the young plants, but harvest this "nurse" crop as soon as      the beans are growing well. You may also have to support      tall bush types with brushy twigs if they're exposed to      winds.</p><p>In colder regions, it might be late May before      cold-sensitive pole beans can be planted. Longer growing      seasons, however, can often support two crops. To determine      whether this is possible in your area, take the number of      days to maturity for a particular variety, and count back      from the fall frost date, adding a week or so for good      measure.</p><p>Single rows of pole beans should be spaced three      to four feet apart, with double rows spaced 12 inches      apart. Sow the seeds two inches deep and 10 inches apart.      Or plant them in hills spaced three to five feet apart,      sowing the seeds at least 10 inches apart. Don't plant too      thickly, since crowded vines are subject to rust disease.      Put in supports at the time of planting or as soon as the      first two leaves of the seedlings open.</p><p>There are several      popular methods of supporting pole beans. Complete coverage      of these is given in "High-Rise Plantings" on page 84. My      favorite method is to lash 10 poles together at the top,      fan them out, and stick them firmly in the ground. This      bean "tipi" is ideal when space is limited, and it also      makes a fine playhouse for children. Half runners are often      interplanted with corn, utilizing the stalks for support      while replenishing some of the nitrogen that corn takes out      of the soil.</p><p>It's very important to keep weeds out of the      rows and from between the plants, but be careful not to      injure the beans' roots when hoeing. Also, pull the soil up      toward the rows, not away from them. Once the pods have      formed, gently remove any weeds by hand, and never      cultivate or harvest beans when the plants are wet from dew      or rain, because this can spread diseases.</p><p>Keep the soil      moist until the beans have germinated (about seven days for      bush beans and eight to 14 days for pole beans). Water      deeply at least once a week if there's no rain. And while      moisture is necessary if the blossoms are to set, keep in      mind that a hard hose spray can knock off both blossoms and      small pods. Once the soil is warm and well watered, mulch      to keep down weeds and conserve moisture.</p><h3>What to      Watch For</h3><p> As you've probably gathered by now,      beans are subject to a number of diseases. Many can be      avoided by buying disease-free seeds and disease-resistant      varieties, by rotating the crop every one to two years and      by spacing plants far enough apart to provide good      aeration. Should a disease attack, destroy the infected      plant immediately, don't touch other plants with unwashed      hands or clippers, and don't sow beans in that area of the      garden again for at least five years. Here are some common      diseases you should watch out for:</p><p><em>Anthracnose</em> , a      fungus disease brought on by cool, wet summers, causes      black, egg-shaped, sunken cankers on the plants' pods,      stems and seeds, and the leaves may show black marks on the      veins. Buy resistant varieties, and don't spread the spores      by handling the plants when wet.</p><p><em>Bacterial blight</em>      is prevalent in warm, humid areas and commonly starts with      large brown blotches on the leaves. The foliage may fall      off, eventually killing the plant.</p><p><em>Mosaic,</em> usually      caused by a virus that lives in the seed, spreads from      diseased plants to healthy ones. It first yellows the      leaves and eventually will stunt growth. Buy resistant      varieties.</p><p><em>Rust,</em> which leads to rust-colored,      greatly weakened plants, generally occurs late in the      season. Avoid it by spacing the plants to allow for air      circulation.</p><p><em>Downy mildew</em> attacks beans grown in      foggy areas.</p><p><em>Root rot</em> occurs in soggy soil.</p><p>Many      types of destructive insects can be repelled by planting      savory, nasturtiums and French or African marigolds near      the bean patch. Some, such as aphids and spider mites, can      be discouraged with garlic or soap sprays, sticky traps,      diatomaceous earth and wood ashes. (As mentioned, hard hose      sprays, which are an effective deterrent, might knock of      blossoms and young pods.) Bean crops in some eastern      sections of the country and in the Southwest are plagued by      the Mexican bean beetle, which in its adult state is tan      with black spots on its wings and resembles the beneficial      ladybug. Its one third-inch-long larvae are yellow,      spiny-looking but soft-bodied grubs. Check the plants daily      for these pests and immediately squash any you find. Also,      check under each leaf for little clusters of yellow eggs,      and destroy them before they hatch and the hungry larvae go      to work. To reduce the bean-beetle problem in your own      garden, find out when the heaviest outbreaks are likely to      occur, and try to plant at a time that will avoid them. You      can also alternate rows of potatoes and bush beans to      reduce the beetle populations on both crops. Assassin bugs      and the tiny wasp <em>Pediobius foveolatus</em> prey on the      bean beetle. As a last resort, use rotenone or pyrethrum      for serious infestations.</p><h3>How to Harvest and      Store</h3><p>If green-bean pods are allowed to ripen so      that the beans inside are fully formed, the plants stop      producing and soon die, so pick the beans when they are      young and tender and have a crispy snap. Because beans      mature so quickly, check on them almost every day. Harvest      bush beans by snapping them off with thumbnail and fingers      on the meaty part under the calyx. Scissors can be used on      pole beans and bush-type runner beans. In either case, be      gentle, because yanking off the pods can uproot the plant.      Cut off and discard, too, any overly mature beans you may      have overlooked in the dense foliage.</p><p>Green beans taste      best if served the day they're picked, which is one of the      best reasons for putting in a bean patch in the first      place. They also retain much of that fresh, homegrown      flavor when processed right from the garden into the      freezer. The usual method is to blanch the clean, prepared      vegetables in boiling water for three minutes, cool them      immediately in cold water, drain them, pack them into      containers (leaving headroom), and seal and freeze them.      However, a friend of ours simply fills her containers with      raw beans, covers them with cold water and freezes them      immediately. She swears they taste fresh-picked if they're      used within three or four months.</p><p>To can beans, cover      washed, prepared beans with boiling water; boil them from      three to five minutes, and pack them loosely in hot jars.      Add salt (optional), and cover the beans with boiling      cooking liquid, leaving one-half inch of headroom. Adjust      the lids, and process the jars at 10 pounds of pressure; 20      minutes for pints and 25 minutes for quarts. Complete the      seals if necessary. Generally, it takes about two-thirds to      one pound of beans per pint. Or, put another way, one      bushel of beans (some 30 pounds) will make 30 to 45 pints.</p><p>      And to avoid that old complaint of "beans, again?" offer      variation by preserving the beans whole, in julienne strips      or cut both straight across and on a slant in various      lengths. Always remove the stem end from beans, but the      blossom end can be left on or not.</p><p>If, after canning and      freezing, you still have beans left over, you might try      making old-fashioned "leather britches." Use a large-eyed      needle to string fresh snap beans on white crochet thread.      Hang them in full sun for two or three days until they're      dry, then remove the thread, and spread the beans in a      single layer on cookie sheets. Place them in a warm oven      for about five minutes, then store the beans in glass jars.      To cook the beans, break them, wash them, and soak them      overnight in water. Pour off the soaking water, add more,      bring the beans to a boil, and simmer them for several      hours until they're tender.    </p>
