            <p><strong>PET CORNERS</strong></p>        <p>      <em>Your pet's hair may even betray it, becoming gray and      brittle.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Randy Kidd, D.V.M    </h5>		<p><strong>EVERY YEAR I GET MORE AND MORE</strong> aware of the aging    process. I'm now wearing bifocals, my joints tend to creak a    mite when I first rise from a chair, and when the grandsons    want to wrestle I'd usually just as soon read to them from    Mother Goose.</p>    <p>      Dogs and cats (and other pets) go through the same sort of      changes as they age. And because a pet's life span is so      much shorter than yours and mine, an animal can seem      literally to age before our eyes.    </p>    <p>      There's no way that I or my pets can halt our aging; we've      all been genetically programmed to live a certain number of      years, give or take a few. What we can do, however, is      improve the quality of the time we've got.    </p>    <p>      As an animal ages, all its body systems tend to lose their      strength, suppleness and efficiency. But some organs and      body parts in particular develop problems that warrant      special attention.    </p>    <h3>      The Kidneys</h3>     <p>      The kidneys are a pair of crucial organs that are greatly      affected by the aging process, especially in dogs. Kidney      functional lossto some degree or other-is the price      your dog will almost surely pay for growing old.    </p>    <p>      One of the first signs that the kidney isn't behaving up to      par is when a dog drinks more fluids to help his kidneys      function-and when, as a result, he spends lots of      time with his leg lifted at the fire hydrant. If it is      allowed to progress, chronic kidney disease can lead to      severe physical problems, uremia and even death.    </p>    <p>      The problem that comes along with kidney functional loss is      that other parts of the body are affected as well. For      example, the kidneys help regulate the amount of mineral      that's deposited in the bones. With severe kidney      dysfunction, a dog's bones may become rubberlike-a      syndrome often referred to as "rubber jaw."    </p>    <p>      Other body functions, such as red-bloodcell production and      body-salt regulation, are also controlled by the kidneys.      So loss of any amount of functional kidney can create an      extreme hardship on the aging animal.    </p>    <p>      Keeping your pet's kidneys healthy, then, is one of your      primary tasks. Keep plenty of fresh water where your pet      can easily get to it-and expect that you may have to      revert to some of the puppy-training tactics you used years      ago. More frequent outings will be necessary to give Pooch      a chance to pass off the excess wastes. And it might be a      good idea to put down layers of paper somewhere near your      pet's bed to catch the nighttime dribbles.    </p>    <p>      It's been shown that excess dietary protein can actually      harm an animal's kidneys. To avoid this, plan a diet that      has a decreased amount of high-quality protein. In addition      to protein's potential for harm, the mineral      phosphorus-in excess amounts-can cause      demineralization, or softening, of the bones. Dietary      intake of phosphorus should therefore be limited.    </p>    <p>      There are specially prepared, low-protein and      low-phosphorus diets that are commercially available. Check      with your veterinarian for recommendations.    </p>    <h3>      "Old Man Joints"</h3>    <p>      When a pup playfully romps around the yard, it does so on      joints that are perfectly smooth and flexible. As your pet      ages, however, "normal" wear and tear may cause those      smooth joint surfaces to erode and eventually roughen.      (These painful changes are, of course, greatly accelerated      if the pup or kitty has had an accident that affects a      joint, or if it has spent a lifetime walking on legs that      are structurally abnormal.)    </p>    <p>      As you can well imagine, every time those eroded joint      surfaces are flexed, the one roughened surface rubbing      against the other can cause a considerable amount of ouch!      This type of pain is usually the kind that wears off as      Pooch "warms out of it." That is, after Pooch takes a few      reluctant first steps, the initial pain gradually      diminishes, and he begins to walk normally.    </p>    <p>      There is some evidence that in humans much of our joint      damage due to age can be avoided by maintaining a moderate      exercise program throughout our lifetime. It's been my      observation that this is generally true in pets      also-animals that are kept reasonably active don't      come down later on with joint ailments.    </p>    <p>      So keep your dog feeling like a puppy throughout the dozen      or so years he'll be with you. Take him on a 20- to      30-minute walk at least four or five times a week. As he      ages he'll undoubtedly be less and less apt to take off for      far-flung romps. That's perfectly OK. Let the old geezer      decide how hard he wants to exercise. But for his health's      sake, make sure he gets that exercise.    </p>    <p>      If the old man seems to be in pain, try a daily dose of      aspirin. Maintenance aspirin dosage in dogs is 25 to 35      mg/kg of body weight every eight hours. Translated, this      means about one adult aspirin (325 mg) per 20 to 30 pounds      of average-sized pooch, three times a day. Baby aspirin (81      mg per tablet) can be used for the smaller critters, with      appropriate dosage based on body weight.    </p>    <h3>      Dental Care</h3>    <p>      Although dogs and cats are not immune to tooth decay,      cavities are not nearly as prevalent in them as they are in      our sweets-loving children. However, dental calculus (a      buildup of crusty, mineral material on the surfaces of the      teeth) is often a severe problem, especially in the      elderly. Excessive calculus can cause infection and      eventual tooth loss and can even be life-threatening when      untreated.    </p>    <p>      If your pet has nasty breath, chances are good he already      has dental calculus. Ol' Rotten Mouth needs a professional      tooth cleaning and scaling, best performed while he's under      an anesthetic. See your vet.    </p>    <p>      Dogs and cats that are fed dry or kibbled foods are less      likely to develop calculus. An occasional doggie bone also      acts as a fair tooth cleaner. But to really do an effective      job of tooth care, get out the toothbrush. There are      toothbrushes and toothpastes specially made for pets, which      will help eliminate calculus.    </p>    <p>      It's amazing to me just how quickly (admittedly after a few      training sessions) most pets come to appreciate their daily      tooth cleaning. I've had folks tell me that Pooch will find      and fetch the toothbrush when it's time for the daily      brushing.    </p>    <h3>      Eyes, Ears, Nose and Tongue</h3>    <p>      Just as I've had to learn to live with my bifocals, so too      will a pet-and his human family-have to learn      to live with sense organs that are gradually losing their      abilities. Older dogs and cats simply don't see as well as      they once did, and they'll probably need a louder shout to      bring 'em home from the back forty. As a pet's sense of      smell and taste gradually diminish, so too may his      appetite.    </p>    <p>      An animal that can't see or hear up to par may react      suddenly to quick movements or noises; work and play around      the old man quietly and slowly. Expect a little      crotchetiness; you and I will probably feel the same way      when we're a little older. And try to make any changes as      gradual as possiblechanges in diet, for example, or in your      daily exercise routine.    </p>    <h3>      The Rest of the Story</h3>    <p>      While it may seem that some of your pet's body parts are      aging faster than others, remember that all systems are      undergoing change. The overall mass of cells of the brain      gradually decreases (which may explain why it is that when      Rufus and I now go into a room, neither of us can remember      why we are there). Muscle mass also tends to decrease with      age, and the belly may become more like a paunch.    </p>    <p>      Heart failure is not uncommon in the older pet, and tumors      of the skin, lungs and other parts of the body can      accumulate with age. Specific diseases, such as diabetes      and prostatitis, are more prevalent with each passing year.      Even a pet's hair betrays him, gradually taking on the      silver hues that announce to the world his senior      citizenship.    </p>    <p>      That's the bad news; the good news is that we can slow or      halt many of these changes. Consistent exercise-in      moderation-is a potent fighter of the "normal"      ravages of aging. Proper nutrition helps each and every      body part, generating a healthy, well-oiled machine that      may not last forever, but that will certainly go its share      of the miles.    </p>    <p>      And finally, the love that comes from a family that      cares-truly cares-is like a gentle and lasting      heart massage, giving a pet every reason to feel his best,      do his best and last his longest.    </p>
