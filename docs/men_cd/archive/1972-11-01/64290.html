                    <p>      OK, homesteaders . . . here's the second installment of      Morton Salt's superior booklet, A COMPLETE GUIDE TO HOME      MEAT CURING. MOTHER NO. 17 told you how to butcher, halve      and chill a hog. This section takes you most of the way      through curing the pork that results.    </p>    <p>      We'll be serializing more from the Morton Salt handbook in      future issues . . . but we still advise you to drop $1.25      into the mail and add the manual to your farmstead      bookshelf right now. It's packed with valuable information      on butchering, cutting up and curing pork, beef, veal,      lamb, poultry and wild game. Get your copy from Morton Salt      Company, P.O. Box 355, Argo, Illinois 60501.    </p>    <p>      Again, our special thanks to Murray J. Pearthree, Morton      Salt Regional Sales Manager, for granting us written      permission to reprint from the booklet.    </p>           <p>      It pays to do a neat job of butchering ang trimming    </p>    <p>      The black guide lines in the picture show where the      different cuts should be made for cutting up the carcass.      Well trimmed meat cures out better and with less waste. The      principal cuts are ham, loin, bacon, shoulder. and jowl.      All of the other pieces can be classified as trimmings.    </p>                        <p>      There is both pride and pleasure in unwrapping a neatly      trimmed ham, shoulder, or bacon side months after the meat      is cured. By doing a neat job of trimming all of the small      extra pieces can be used to greater advantage for sausage,      head cheese, scrapple, etc. than if they were left on the      larger cuts where they would dry up in the cure and be of      little value.    </p>    <h3>      CUTTING AND SALTING WARM MEAT OFTEN CAUSES BONE SOURING    </h3>    <p>      Meat should not be cut up and put in cure until it is      thoroughly chilled. Bone souring is often the result of      meat being improperly chilled or from the application of      salt on warm meat. It is often believed that meat should be      trimmed and salted as soon as butchering is completed or it      will not take the salt properly. Nothing could be further      frorn the facts than this, because actual harm instead of      good can easily be done by salting warm meat.    </p>    <p>      When salt is applied on warm meat it helps hold the animal      heat in and this heat, along with moisture, gases, and a      little blood that is usually in the joints, makes an ideal      combination to start bone taint which in a short time may      cause souring and spoilage. Meat spoilage can result from a      number of causes. If the hogs arc hot and excited when      butchered, the meat will be in a feverish condition, making      it much easier for souring to start before the meat can      take the cure. If a good bleed is not obtained, the excess      blood around the joints can easily cause souring to begin.      If a good chill is not obtained, the natural bacteria in      the rneat multiples faster than the cure can take hold. If      salt is applied on warm meat. this can cause souring to      start by helping hold the animal heat in the meat instead      of allowing it to escape.    </p>    <p>      Start cutting up the carcass at the shoulder, sawing      through the third and fourth ribs at right angles to the      back. Each side has 14 ribs.    </p>    <p>      Complete the cut with the knife and turn the shoulder over      and cut off the jowl at a point where the backbone ends,      which is in line with the wrinkle of the neck.    </p>        <p>      Trim some of the cheek meat from the jowl and flatten it      out with the broad side of a cleaver or hatchet and square      it up by trimming with a knife. The trimmed jowl is known      as a "bacon square" and can be cured and used the same as      bacon, or used for seasoning with boiled foods.    </p>        <p>      Remove the neck bone from the shoulder, leaving very little      meat on the bone. Trim up the shoulder and cut off the      shank. This is the "long cut" method of trimming and will      give you the maximum of cured meat from the shoulder. Shank      is sawed off above knee joint.    </p>    <h3>      LONG CUT SHOULDER READY FOR CURING    </h3>            <p>      Where smaller cured cuts are desired, the shoulder can be      divided between the smallest part of the blade bone,      producing a picnic shoulder and butt. The picnic shoulder      will cure out quicker than the long cut method and makes a      convenient, handy size shoulder for small families. When      the shoulder is separated into picnic and butt the clear      plate, which is the covering of fat on the top of the      shoulder butt, is trimmed off. This fat may be cured for      seasoning or used for lard. The lean portion is known as      the "Boston" butt and can be cured or used for sausage.      When neatly trimmed up the picnic shoulder has the      appearance of a small ham.    </p>    <p>      To take off the ham, saw on a line at right angles to the      hind shank and at a point about three finger widths .in      font of the aitch bone. Finish the cut with the knife and      start shaping the ham by curving the cut on the belly side.    </p>    <p>      To remove the tail bone slip the knife under the tail bone      and continue the cut along the bone, keeping the knife as      flat as possible.    </p>    <p>      If the hams were faced when the carcass was hung up to      chill, each ham will now require comparatively little      trimming. When the tail bone is removed, the hams should be      smoothed up and all loose pieces of meat trimmed off and      put in sausage. If these corners and loose pieces are left      on the hams, they will dry up in the cure, having little      food value, and the hams will be less attractive. Hams that      are neatly trimmed cure better and are easier to wrap.    </p>                <p>      If hams are exceptionally fat, and if too much fat is      objectionable, the hams can be skinned. This is done by      leaving a collar of skin around one-third of the ham at the      shank end. The balance of the fat is trimmed off leaving      about Y4 inch of fat over the lean. Skinned hams do not      keep as well as hams that are not skinned and for that      reason skinning is not recommended as a general practice.      After hams are trimmed, saw off the shanks just below the      button of the hock.    </p>    <p>      To separate the loin from from the belly the ribs are sawed      across at their greatest curvature. This is about 1/3 the      distance from the top of the backbone to the bottom part of      the belly edge. Make this cut so as to include the      tenderloin with the loin. After the ribs are sawed through,      finish the cut with the knife completely separating the      belly side from the loin. Lay the belly on the table shin      side up and smooth out the wrinkles as well as possible      with the palm of the hand. A few sharp blows from the broad      side of a cleaver or hatchet will help loosen the spare      ribs from the belly.    </p>                <p>      Now turn the belly skin side down and trim out the ribs.      Start this cut by loosening the neck bone at the top of the      ribs and keep the knife as flat as possible to avoid      gouging the bacon. pull the ribs upward as the cut is made      and trim as close to the ribs as you can. The cartilaginous      ends or "buttons" of the lower ribs are left on the bacon.    </p>                    <p>      <br />      Square up the bacon by trimming the lower edge first to a      straight line. All of the "seeds," the mammary glands along      the lower edge, should be trimmed out of choice bacon. Next      trim the top on a line parallel to the lower edge until a      good streak of lean appears and then square both ends      enough to reach an attractive lean streak. Frequently there      is an uneven space at the fn end of the bacon, which is      known as the bacon brisket. This may be cured or used for      sausage or hard.    </p>                <h3>      TRIMMING TENDERLOIN FROM THE LOIN    </h3>    <p>      The tenderloin is the small lean muscle which lies      underneath the backbone in the rear of the loin. It is one      of the most popular of all pork cuts to be used      fresh.<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>      FRENCHING TENDERLOIN    </h3>        <p>      It is generally prepared by cutting across into pieces      about 1 1/2" thick and Frenching. This is done by placing      the pieces of tenderloin on end on a strip of parchment or      waxed paper and folding the paper over the top of the meat.      The meat is then struck a sharp blow with the flat side of      a cleaver, flattening it out. The paper keeps the meat from      sticking to the table or the cleaver. These delightful      morsels cannot be equalled for tenderness by any rather      pork cut.    </p>    <h3>      REMOVING FAT BACK    </h3>            <p>      After taking out the tenderloin, remove fat back from the      loin by placing the loin skin side down; set the knife      about one fourth inch under the lean or muscle meat, and      make a full length cut. Reverse the loin and make the same      cut from the other side. This separates the fat back from      the loin. The fat lack may be used for lard or may be cured      out and used for seasoning when cooking. The remaining fat      on the loin should be smoothed up to where it is not over      one fourth inch in thickness. The loin is one of the      choicest cuts of the carcass and you will note it is made      possible by center splitting down the middle of the      backbone instead of cutting along each side of the      backbone. One of the most practical ways to use the loin is      to cure it as Canadian style bacon or grind it rip for      making sausage.    </p>    <p>      After trimming the loin, cut up the other one hall of the      carcass starting with the shoulder and finishing with the      loin.    </p>    <p>      It pays to do a neat job of cutting and trimming. You will      get a uniform cure and your meat will have a better flavor      and a more appetizing appearance.    </p>    <p>      For Quality Meat remember these important points:    </p>    <p>      1. Select thrifty hogs of medium weight, 8 to 10 months      old.<br />      2. Keep hogs in a small pen 24 hours before      butchering-give them plenty of fresh water, but no      feed.<br />      3, Sticking is the best method of killing-it is the      most practical and most humane.<br />      4. Get a thorough bleed-cleanliness in dressing and a      quick, efficient chill.<br />      5. Do a neat job of cutting up the carcass and trimming the      pieces. Do not over-cure or under-cure the meat. Curing      directions on following pages.    </p>    <p>      <em>To</em> <em>produce the highest quality cured meat it      is important that every step- the selection of the      live animal, the butchering and the curing be handled with      the utmost care and attention.</em><br />    </p>    <h3>      INTRODUCTION TO MEAT CURING    </h3>    <p>      <em>The purpose in curing meat is to convert live hogs or      other meat animals that are thrifty and in good condition      into high quality cured meat products to keep for future      use.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>The following points are of real importance in      turning out high quality cured meat:</strong>    </p>    <p>      1. Be sure that the hogs or other meat animals are quiet      and in proper condition when butchered or otherwise the      meat may be feverish before it is ever put in cure.    </p>    <p>      2. Handle the job of butchering, bleeding, and cleaning      efficiently and promptly because the natural bacterial      action that causes decomposition and spoilage sets in      immediately after the animal is killed.    </p>    <p>      3. See that the meat is chilled as quickly and as      thoroughly as possible. Thorough chilling of meat arrests      the natural bacterial action and holds it in check until      the curing ingredients have a chance to offset further      bacteria multiplication.    </p>    <p>      4. Do a good job of trimming and curing, and test the meat      while it is in cure. Use high quality curing ingredients      that are especially prepared for the purpose.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5. In general, all meat should be cured at      temperatures between 38 and 44 degrees Fahrenheit. Lower      temperatures slow the curing process, while higher      temperatures can cause spoiling.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      ONLY TWO CURING METHOD:    </h3>    <p>      There are only two major methods of curing meat; the Dry      Cure and the Brine or Sweet Pickle Cure.    </p>    <p>      The Dry Cure is the method most generally used, especially      for the heavier cuts such as hams, shoulders, and bacon.      The Sweet Pickle Cure is more generally used for the      smaller pieces. Either the Dry or Sweet Pickle Cure is      good. The method used is a matter of personal preference.    </p>    <p>      Morton Sugar Cure and Morton Tender-Quick may be used for      either Cure.    </p>    <h3>      SALT ALONE CANNOT PRODUCE HIGHEST QUALITY MEAT    </h3>    <p>      The highest quality cured meat cannot be turned out when      salt alone is used, because salt alone hardens the muscle      fibres and tends to make the meat oversalty and dry.    </p>    <p>      To produce quality cured meat other ingredients must be      blended with the salt in the correct proportions, and when      this is done the cure is then termed the "Dry Sugar Cure"      if used in dry form, or the "Sweet Pickle Cure" when used      in the brine form.    </p>    <p>      Morton Sugar Cure contains salt, sugar, saltpetre, black      and red pepper. a combination of spices. It is available in      two forms: without smoke and with natural hickory smoke      flavor. This makes it a complete sugar-curing salt, and a      complete product of this kind produces the highest quality      meat.    </p>    <h3>      CAREFULLY BLENDED INGREDIENTS FOR QUALITY AND SAFETY    </h3>    <p>      Salt is the basic curing ingredient for meat, but to      produce product it is necessary to blend the other      ingredients with the salt. The sugar tends to retard the      hardening action of the salt and gives a more pleasing,      milder flavor to the meat. The peppers and spices give a      delicious balance to the flavor and improve the keeping      qualities after the cure is completed. The saltpetre      strikes in ahead of the salt and helps bring out and retain      the rich, cherry red color so desirable in cured meats. The      natural hickory smoke flavor imparts the flavoring      properties of wood smoke to the meat while it is curing.      This method of curing and flavoring at the same time saves      extra work-does the job safer and adds new delicious      flavor to the meat.    </p>    <p>      Morton's perfectly blended Sugar Cure makes the practical      cure for applying on the outside of the meat. In addition      to applying Sugar Cure on the outside of the meat a better      and more uniform job of curing can be done if the meat is      pumped along the bone and at the joints when it is put in      cure. Morton Tender-Quick is the ideal product to use for      making the pumping pickle.    </p>    <p>      Tender-Quick is a special cure perfected for the purpose of      pumping along the bone area in hams and shoulders, for      pumping extra large bacon, and for making into a pickle for      curing the smaller pieces.    </p>    <p>      Tender-Quick consists of the highest grade meat salt and a      combination of super-quality curing ingredients so      accurately proportioned and so perfectly blended that it      produces a fast cure, improves flavor, makes meat more      tender, and prevents over-saltiness.    </p>    <h3>      A QUICKER CURE    </h3>    <p>      The natural bacteria that are always present in the blood      and tissues of live hogs begin to multiply as soon as the      hog is butchered.    </p>    <p>      It is important to get a good bleed and a good chill as      soon as possible after the hogs are butchered to help hold      this natural bacterial action in check until the curing      ingredients have had time to penetrate into the fibres of      the meat and set up curing action. A good job of chilling      arrests the bacterial action long enough to give the salt      and curing ingredients an opportunity to strike in and      start the cure. In large pieces of meat, such as hams and      shoulders, the bone joints are always the danger spots      because bacterial action develops fastest around the bone      area. If the meat is not properly bled the many small      tendons, ligaments and tiny muscles form a convenient place      for the collection of blood. If the meat is not properly      chilled out, gases and interior animal heat will be      retained. When the cure is appled on the outside of the      meat, it must work entirely through the thick meaty      portions of the hams and shoulders and into the bone area      before the natural bacterial action can be arrested around      the hones and joints, and it is in this area that the      natural bacteria multiply the fastest and can most quickly      cause bone taint.    </p>    <p>      <strong>That is why the easiest, quickest, and safest way      to cure hams and shoulders is to pump a pickle made with      Tender-Quick along the bone area and apply Sugar Cure in      the regular way to cure from the outside toward the      center.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      MORTON'S "COMBINATION" CURE    </h3>    <p>      Using Morton Sugar Cure and Tender-Quick in this manner is      termed the "Combination" cure. TenderQuick cures from the      inside bone area outward and Sugar Cure strikes in from the      outside.    </p>    <p>      Tender-Quick makes a perfect pumping pickle. The only      practical way to apply the TenderQuick pickle along the      bones and at the joints is to dissolve TenderQuick in      water, making a pickle which can be drawn up into a Morton      Meat Pump and then injected into the meat along the bone.      The water used for making the pickle should be boiled first      and allowed to cool.    </p>    <p>      The Tender-Quick pickle, when pumped into the meat, starts      curing around the bone area immediately. It does not make      the meat over-salty, and helps eliminate bone taint.    </p>    <p>      As soon as the Tender-Quick pickle has been pumped along      the bones, Sugar Cure can be applied on the. outside of the      meat in the regular manner. By using this combination cure      the cure starts both inside and outside at the same time.      The hams and shoulders will be delicately pink, delicious      in flavor, and perfectly and uniformly cured throughout,      The bone area will be just as well cured as the balance of      the ham and there will be no over or under-cured spots.      It's the cure itself that makes fine hams and bacon.    </p>    <p>      Morton Sugar Cure and Tender Quick contain everything      necessary for perfect curing everything necessary for      perfect curing.    </p>    <h3>      PUMPING MEAT    </h3>    <p>      <em>The purpose of pumping meat is to get the curing      ingredients distributed throughout</em> <em>the interior of      the meat in order that curing can begin or, the inside and      cure outward same time that curing begins the outside and      works inward.</em> <em><br /></em><br />      Cure meat from the inside out at the same time, it is      curing; from the outside in. You will get a quicker, more      uniform and milder cure with no, over-cured or under-cured      spots-no bone taint. Every bit of the meat will be      thoroughly cured, mild and delicious in flavor.<br />    </p>    <p>      Pumping meat is one of the best safeguards against bone      taint and bone souring, and especially if the meat were      insufficiently chilled or frozen before being put in cure.      Pumping meal insures a more uniform cure. It is advisable      to pump hams and shoulders next to the bone, as well as      large bacon. Pieces such as tongues, dried beef, corned      beef, Canadian style bacon etc. can all be improved in      mildness and uniformity of cure when pumped.    </p>    <h3>      START CURING AT THE BONE    </h3>    <p>      It require much longer for the curing salt to penetrate      into hams and shoulders and set up enough curing action      around the bone if the salt is applied only on the outside      of the meat. The bone area is the danger zone when curing      meat and if the meat around the bones, which is made up of      small ligaments, muscles, and connecting tissue, is not      thoroughly cured. The whole ham or shoulder is inferior in      quality and flavor.    </p>    <p>      Tender-Quick contains salt and a combination of quality      curing ingredients that make it especially suitable for      pumping meat. When mixed with water, Tender-Quick goes into      solution easily, and, when pumped into the meat, penetrates      quickly and uniformly into the meat tissues surrounding the      bone.    </p>    <p>      <em>After the meat has been chilled and cut up, lightly rub      the pieces with Morton Sugar Cure and place skin side down      on a tilted table to drain for some 6 to 12 hours. Use      about</em> <em>1</em> <em>lb. for each 100 lbs.</em> <em>of      meat. This</em> <em>light application of the sugar-curing      Salt will draw the first flush of blood and water from the      meat.</em>    </p>    <h3>      CURING    </h3>    <p>      After the meat is drained, make a Tender-Quick pumping      pickle for pumping the large pieces.    </p>    <p>      To make the pickle, use water that has previously been      boiled and cooled, and mix TenderQuick with the water,      stirring until it dissolves.    </p>    <p>      For curing meat that is to be kept for varying lengths of      time the following ratio of water and Tender-Quick should      be used:    </p>    <p>      2 lbs. of Tender-Quick to 3 quarts of water for meat that      is to be carried over the summer or for meat that is to be      kept 8 months to a year before being used.    </p>    <p>      2 lbs. of Tender-Quick per gallon of water for meat that is      to be kept for only 3 to 6 months.    </p>    <p>      The amount of Tender-Quick pumping pickle to use is 1 to 1      1/2 oz. of pickle per pound of meat. For ready reference      the following shows the amounts of Tender-Quick for making      a full strength pumping pickle which is to be used fear      curing meat that is kept 8 to 12 months:    </p>    <p>      2 lbs. of Tender-Quick to 3 quarts of water will make 96      oz. of pumping pickle.    </p>    <p>      4 lbs. of Tender-Quick to 1 1/2 gallons of water will make      192 oz. of pumping pickle.    </p>    <p>      8 lbs. of Tender-Quick to 3 gallons of water will make 384      oz. of pumping pickle.    </p>    <p>      The Morton meat pump holds 4 oz. of pickle. The needle of      the pump is hollow and has a number of holes in it.      Submerge the entire needle of the pump in the pickle and      pull up on the handle to draw the pump full of pickle. When      first drawing up the pickle before starting to pump meat,      work the handle back and forth a few times to get the      barrel full of pickle without air pockets. For the most      sanitary job the pump needle should be dipped in boiling      water before it is used. and while pumping meat do not      touch the needle with the hands or lay it down. When the      pump is not in use, let it stand needle end down in the jar      or crock that contains the pickle.    </p>    <h3>      PUMPING MEAT    </h3>    <p>      Draw the pump full of pickle and insert the pump needle its      full length into the meat and push with a slow even      pressure on the pump handle to inject the pickle. As the      pickle is forced into the meat around the bone, gradually      draw the pump toward you in order to distribute the pickle      as evenly as possible along the bone.    </p>        <p>      Pumping meat is simple and anyone can do a good job. The      aim is to get the pickle distributed as uniformly as      possible along the bone area. Each pumpful of pickle is      called a stroke, and after the stroke is completed and the      needle withdrawn there will be a tendency for a small      amount of the pickle to run out of the meat. Pinch the      needle hole together with the thumb and fore finger for a      few seconds after the needle is withdrawn.    </p>    <p>      While the pickle is being injected, the meat around the      needle bulges a little, which is all right, but always use      a slow even stroke when injecting the pickle.    </p>    <p>      For hams and shoulders that weigh 10 to 15 lbs. use 3 to 4      pumpfuls of pickle, which will be 12 to 16 oz. For hams and      shoulders that weigh 15 to 25 lbs. Use 5 to 6 pumpfuls,      which would be 20 to 24 oz. Always have the meat pump full      of pickle to prevent air pockets.    </p>        <p>      The X-ray diagrarns of a ham and shoulder show the bone      structure and the lines show how and where the needle of      the meat pump should be inserted for making the five      different pumping strokes for large hams and shoulders. For      small hams or shoulders eliminates strokes Nos. 4 and 5.    </p>    <p>      For pumping bacon insert the needle in the fat part of the      heavy bacon and pump about 1 to 1 1/2 oz. of pickle per      pound of meat. The needle can be inserted around the edges      and at the ends to distribute the pickle uniformly.    </p>    <h3>      APPLYING THE SUGAR-CURE    </h3>        <p>      After the pieces have been pumped, apply Morton Sugar Cure,      using 5 to 6 lbs. for each 100 lbs. of meat. The first step      is to work the Cure around the bones, especially well at      the hock and knee joints, working in as much Cure as the      skin covering will hold and push it well down. Then rub the      Cure in well all over the meat, using a slow kneading      motion. Apply the Sugar Cure on both flesh and skin sides.      After the Cure has been rubbed over all of the pieces, pack      the meat in a convenient place for curing.    </p>            <p>      Meat can be packed in a box or barrel or on a table. Before      the pack is started, sprinkle a little Cure over the bottom      of the box and over the pieces as they are packed. The      heaviest pieces should be at the bottom and the lighter      ones on top. Do not pack the meat over three feet deep.      Keep the curing box clear of the ground; bore a few holes      in the bottom to let the bloody water drain out.    </p>    <p>      In mild weather cover the box with a cloth to prevent flies      from getting at the meat. In very cold weather the meat      should be covered to keep it from freezing. Meat that is      allowed to freeze, either before or after it is put in      cure, will never make as nice a finished product as if it      had not been frozen. When meat freezes. the moisture in the      small cells and fibres expands and bursts the meat tissues,      which lowers the quality of the finished product. If your      meat does freeze, remember that while it is frozen it will      not take the Cure, therefore, no curing action can take      place so long as the meat remains frozen. The action      virtually stops when the inside temperature of the meat      gets below 34°. The ideal meat curing temperature is      between 38° and 40° and the nearer this temperature      the meat can be kept while it is in cure, the nicer the      finished product will be. If, due to unusual circumstances      meat freezes while it is being chilled, it should be thawed      out to about 38° and put in cure. Meat that was frozen      when chilling, or frozen while in the cure should be given      extra care and attention, and should be used up as soon as      practicable after coming from the cure.    </p>    <h3>      SECOND APPLICATION OF SUGAR-CURE    </h3>    <p>      After the meat has been in the pack four or five days,      break the pack and give a second application of Sugar Cure,      using about 2 or 3 lbs per 100 lbs. of meat. Then repack      the meat in a different position.    </p>    <p>      If a real mild cure is desired, do not give the second      application to bacon or small pieces. Also the meat is to      be used shortly after it comes the cure, the total amount      of Sugar Cure used per 100 lbs. of meat can be reduced in      proportion. Where meat is to be kept from one curing season      to the next, it is necessary to give it a heavier      cure-for to 6 lbs. of Sugar Cure per 100 lbs. of meat      is enough for a mild cure-8 to 9 lbs. for a full      cure.    </p>    <p>      For hams and shoulders to have the best flavor they should      season out after the cure for some 30 to 60 days before      being used, and even longer is preferable. Bacon should      season out 10 to 15 days before being used.    </p>    <p>      The amount of Cure to use for 100 lbs. of meat will vary      with different sections of the country and with individual      preferences. It does not take as much salt to cure meat in      high; dry altitude as it does in more humid sections. These      points must be adjusted, depending on individual      preferences, climatic conditions and length of time meat is      to be kept.    </p>    <p>      Fresh meat is a perishable product and to turn live hogs      into quality hams and bacon calls for proper care and      attention in doing all parts of the job. There are a number      of factors that enter into butchering and curing that have      a definite part in turning out quality meat. It is very      important not to get the hogs excited or overheated when      butchering, If a thorough bleed and a good chill are not      obtained, souring can easily start before the meat is put      in cure. Regardless of the kind of curing salt used, it is      necessary to do a good job of butchering, bleeding. and      chilling.    </p>    <h3>      OVERHAULING THE MEAT    </h3>    <p>      While the meat is in cure. the pack should be broken and      the meat overhauled once for smaller pieces and twice for      heavier ones. These overhauling periods should be some      seven to ten days apart and the Cure should be rubbed on      any bare spots.    </p>    <h3>      LENGTH OF TIME IN CURE    </h3>    <p>      Meat should remain in cure about 2 days per pound for hams      and shoulders and about 1 1/2 days per pound for smaller      pieces. For example, a 10 lb. ham should cure 20 days; a 20      lb. ham 40 days; a 10 lb. side of bacon 15 days. Different      size pieces should cure in proportion to their weight.      Weather conditions help control the length of time meat      should cure for best results. It requires longer for meat      to take the Cure in real cold weather than in milder      weather. Much home cured meat has become over-salty by      being left in the cure entirely too long. On the other      hand, meat that is taken out of the cure too soon when the      weather remains cold may be only partially cured, because      meat will not take the Cure when the temperature of the      meat goes much below 34°.    </p>    <h3>      WASH MEAT WHEN TAKEN FROM CURE    </h3>    <p>      After meat wines from cure, wash it in luke warm water. Let      smaller pieces soak 30 to 40 minutes and larger ones about      an hour. Use a stiff bristle brush to scrub off collected      grease and salt. Then hang the meat and let it drain until      dry. Do not wrap meat until it is thoroughly dry. In damp      weather it is advisable to hang the meat in a warm room or      build a small fire to get it dry. This will help prevent      mold after the meat is wrapped.    </p>    <h3>      WRAPPING AND SACKING MEAT    </h3>    <p>      If meat is left exposed to the air, slow oxidation of the      fat takes place which causes rancidness, a darkened color,      and strong flavor. Proper wrapping prevents most of this      trouble and is also one of the best methods of keeping out      skippers and other insects. Place a piece of muslin or      cheesecloth (cornmeal or flour sacks) on the table and wrap      each piece separately. Then wrap in layers of heavy paper      and place in strong paper bags. Tie bag tops so insects      cannot enter, and hang away. When hung, the pieces should      be separated enough not to touch and should be away from      walls to keep insects, mice, or rats from reaching the      meat. Meat should be hung in a dark, cool, well-ventilated      place.    </p>    <h3>      SWEET PICKLE CURE    </h3>    <p>      After pumping, rub with Sugar Cure, using about 3 lbs. of      salt per 100 Ibs. of meat, and pack the meat skin side down      in a well scalded crock or barrel, placing the larger      pieces on the bottom and the smaller ones on top. The top      layer of meat should be placed skin side up. After the meat      is placed in the barrel, mix a curing brine, using 7 Ibs.      of Sugar Gure with each 5 gallons of water, stirring it      well until the salt is dissolved. The water should have      previously been boiled and allowed to cool. Pour this      curing brine over the meat until the pack begins to shift      or float. This shifting permits the brine to come in      contact with all parts of the meat. Place a clean stone or      other weight on top of the meat and pour in enough      additional curing brine to fully cover the meat. The weight      should be heavy enough to hold the meat below the brine.    </p>    <p>      After the meat has been in the sweet pickle brine about 5      days, remove the meat and brine and repack each piece of      meat in a different position, again weighting it down, and      pour the brine back over it. Overhaul in this manner every      ten days during the balance of the curing period    </p>    <p>      Bacon should cure about 2 days per pound and hams and      shoulders about 3 days per pound. For example, a 10 lb.      side of bacon should cure 20 days and a 15 lb. ham 45 days.      The ideal curing temperature for the sweet pickle cure is      38° and both the meat and pickle should be at this      temperature when put in cure and this temperature held      where possible.    </p>    <p>      If the weather turns mild, watch the brine closely and if      it becomes ropy the meat should be taken out and washed and      the brine boiled and skimmed, or new brine made if the      pickle gets exceptionally ropy.    </p>    <p>      If a new brine is made. it should not be as strong as the      original brine, but its strength should be in proportion to      the length of time the meat has been in cure. For example,      if the meat has been in cure about one-half the proper      length of time, only enough salt should be used to make the      new brine about one-half strength.    </p>    <p>      When the curing time is completed, take out the meat, wash      each piece, and let it dry thoroughly and wrap. See      directions for washing, drying, and wrapping.    </p>    <h3>      WHY MEAT SHOULD BE OVERHAULED    </h3>    <p>      It is important to overhaul by shifting the position of the      pieces of meat and getting the curing pickle remixed while      the meat is curing.    </p>    <p>      There are always spots where the meat is in very close      contact and the pickle cannot penetrate between the pieces      as readily as it should. By overhauling and changing the      position of these pieces the pickle is allowed to come in      uniform contact with all the parts of the meat.    </p>    <p>      When the position of the pieces is changed during      overhauling, the pickle should be stirred up or poured out      of the container and poured back. When pickle is left      standing undisturbed, it becomes uneven, which causes the      density of the curing ingredients in ratio to the water to      be much heavier in one place than another. Removing the      meat and pouring out the pickle, then repacking the pieces      in a different position and pouring the pickle back over      them thoroughly remixes the pickle so that cell parts have      the same density. This allows the pickle to come in uniform      contact with any spots of the meat that may have been      pressed too lightly together.    </p>    <p>      The water used for making the curing pickle should be      perfectly pure. Bacteria and inorganic life, often present      in water, do no harm when the water is used for general      purposes, but they are harmful when the water is used for      curing meat. In order to be sure that the water is pure, it      is always advisable to boil the water and let it cool      before using it to make a curing pickle.    </p>
