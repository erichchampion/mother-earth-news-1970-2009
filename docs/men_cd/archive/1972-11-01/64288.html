    <p>
                    <p>      Home-smoked, mahogany-colored bacon, plump juicy hams,      fresh spicy sausage and snowy lard are mostly nostalgic      memories in this country today . . . but there's no reason      why the time-honored art of curing and smoking meat can't      be revived by the modern homesteader. As a matter of fact,      there's a couple of very good reasons why it should be.    </p>    <p>      In this age of antibiotics, hormones, overcrowded feedlots,      preservatives and quick-cure methods, producing one's own      is practically the only way to be assured of quality meat.      Furthermore, raising a hog is a project especially suited      to the small or beginning farmer because (1) the capital      investment is low, (2) the project is short term and (3)      the family garden can provide a substantial amount of      high-quality food in the pig's diet at negligible cost.    </p>    <p>      Last summer my husband, Arthur, and I undertook the project      of raising and butchering two hogs . . . one for ourselves      and one for a friend. We rendered the lard, made sausage,      cured and smoked bacon and hams . . . all with reasonable      success on the initial try. Our experience should offer      encouragement to anyone else contemplating such an      undertaking for the first time.    </p>    <h3>ONE PIG OR TWO</h3>    <p>      First of all, should you raise one pig or two? The fact is      that a lone hog doesn't grow well at all (he likes to have      company) . . . while today's average family probably      doesn't eat more than one pig in a year. So what's to do?    </p>    <p>      There are at least two ways out of this dilemma. One is to      find a friend who would like to raise his own porker but      has no place to do it. Offer to raise a second pig for your      comrade who will, in turn, bear his share of the cost and      help with the butchering. It will be no more trouble for      you to raise two hogs than one, the pigs will have each      other for company and you'll be doing someone a favor      besides!    </p>    <p>      A second alternative is to raise and butcher two pigs, one      for home consumption and one to sell. Although all states      have laws regarding the butchering and selling of meat      (check with the nearest slaughterhouse), I believe      that-in general practice-no one bothers the      small farmer who raises for himself and sells to his      friends. <em>(A</em> <em>third alternative, of course, is      the raising of one or more "extra" hogs for sale on the      hoof on the open market. With the competition from      commercial pig "factories" what it is today, however, this      is no real alternative at all-Editor.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Should you have doubts about the feasibility of selling      home-butchered meat, find out before you start how many of      your friends and neighbors would be interested in buying      fresh pork next fall. If your experience is anything like      ours, you'll find so many people hankering for real      farm-raised meat that your pig will be "all 'et" before      it's even raised!<br />    </p>    <p>      Although fresh pork does not command a large price, you      should be able to get back as much as you put into the pig      you sell, plus a little extra to offset the cost of the one      you keep for yourself. Furthermore, if you'd like to      receive double the price for your product, you can do so by      curing and smoking some of the meat before you offer it for      sale. I think I'm safe in promising that you'll have no      difficulty in selling your home-smoked bacon and hams. With      such an investment of time and labor (the cost is minimal)      your sales might offset the entire cos of raising the hogs,      and your winter's supply of pork would be free!    </p>    <p>      Let me state, however, that there are no guarantees in this      business and I'm not suggesting that this is a "sure, easy      way to get cheap food". Consider the following before you      start: (1) raising a healthy animal demands a certain      amount of daily care and attention; (2) butchering is not a      particularly pleasant task; (3) the meat must be cured over      an extended period of time; and (4) it must be smoked and      stored properly to insure its keeping qualities.    </p>    <p>      Then again, common sense and a little patience are the only      basic requirements for being a successful hog-raiser and      butcherer. If you like doing things for yourself and want      to start depending on your own hands, this is a good place      to start.    </p>    <h3>FIRST, BUY THE PIG(S)</h3>    <p>      In farm communities, young pigs are usually offered for      sale in the newspapers throughout the spring and summer      months. If you don't find any listed in the papers, ask      around at farm supply stores or drop in on a stock sale . .      . but DON'T go dashing out to buy your pig with the first      twinge of spring fever. To begin with your garden isn't      even planted, much less ready to feed a porker . . . and if      you buy too early you'll find yourself with an expensive      overgrown pet by August or September.    </p>    <p>      There are three things you should know before you buy.      First, pigs are weaned and sold when they're eight weeks      old. (Don't buy pigs weaned at six weeks 'cause they won't      be as healthy.) Secondly, it is generally agreed that a pig      should be butchered when he's six months old; if you feed      him beyond this age you'll only be putting money into him      that you won't get back. Third, unless you have access to a      walk-in cooler, you can't butcher until frosty weather      arrives. The temperature must be down to between 30°      and 40° Fahrenheit so the meat can hang and cool after      butchering.    </p>    <p>      With this information, it's not very hard to decide when to      buy . . . just subtract four months from the time that you      can plan on near-freezing weather in your neck of the      woods. Here in Michigan we butcher at the end of November      so we buy our pigs in late July. Conveniently, the garden      is just starting to produce some surplus at that time of      the summer and it provides more as the pigs grow bigger and      hungrier.    </p>    <h3>WHAT BREED WILL IT BE?</h3>    <p>      The following breeds are popular as lean-meat producers and      shouldn't be hard to find: Yorkshire, Duroc-Jersey,      Berkshire, Hampshire, Poland-China, Chester White and      Tamworth. Ask for either sows (females) or barrows      (castrated males), because the meat from a boar      (uncastrated male) has a very unpleasant odor and taste. If      you have a choice, select the huskiest looking animals of      the litter . . . the ones that have short legs and plump      looking hams. You'll need a wooden crate or box to      transport them in because a pig doesn't handle like other      animals (you can't put a collar around his neck and lead      him where you want him to go).    </p>    <h3>GENERAL CARE AND HOUSING</h3>    <p>      It's been said many times and I'll say it again: the pig is      not a dirty animal. It <em>is</em> his nature to root (he      eats roots, seeds and nuts, and gets necessary minerals      from the soil) and-if confined in a small      space-he will root in his own manure. But this is not      by choice. Provide your pig with plenty of good, clean      rootin' by giving him as large an area of fresh sod as you      can afford to fence, put the pigpen in a different spot      each year . . . and he'll stay clean.    </p>    <p>      Since pigs will root an area free from quack grass in a      season you might wish to confine your animals in a future      garden plot where they can till the soil and fertilize it      for you at the same time! The pig fence need not be high      (three feet is tall enough) but it must be of woven wire      and anchored at the bottom with boards or logs. Pigs don't      go over fences but they do go under.    </p>    <p>      Most literature on housing for swine suggests a floorless,      portable house which can be moved to different parts of the      pen as manure accumulates in one area. The house can be      built of scrap lumber or tin, and five feet square is an      adequate size for two young hogs. In the summer, the      structure will provide shade for the pigs' nearly hairless      bodies (which are susceptible to sunburn). If you give the      hogs straw during the winter, the animals will keep warm in      their house by digging a nest and lining it with the      bedding.    </p>    <p>      Supply your porkers with a large enough space in which to      root, and you won't need to worry about them getting out of      their pen. Some people put rings in their pigs' noses to      keep them from rooting, but this deprives the animal of an      important part of his diet. Good clean rootin' is essential      to Porky's health . . . along with a constant supply of      clean drinking water, fresh air and the opportunity to      exercise. When the weather turns cold, you can help keep      your hogs comfortable by warming their drinking water or      liquid food. With these simple needs fulfilled and an      adequate diet, your pigs should be a happy, healthy part of      the homestead family.    </p>    <h3>FEED</h3>    <p>      A farmer who raises hogs strictly for profit will feed them      the cheapest food he can get. This frequently includes      stale white bread and large amounts of corn. When raising      hogs for your own consumption, however, you'll surely be      more careful of what they eat because the meat you produce      can't be of any better quality than the feed that went into      it. If you're aware of food quality, then you know that      "organically" grown feed produces the highest quality meat      of all. Unfortunately, "organic" feed is not usually      available except to the farmer who raises it himself. So,      until you're set up to produce your own you will have to      use judgment in selecting the best feed available.    </p>    <p>      We did not buy any packaged, prepared hog food for our      animals because such mixtures are expensive and almost sure      to contain antibiotics and other additives. Instead, we      bought grain at the Farm Bureau and had it mixed and ground      to our specifications . . . it wasn't organic, but it      wasn't full of expensive chemicals, either. We turned down      white bread from a bakery, sour milk from a dairy and a      crib full of dried-up corn of uncertain age. We accepted      milk and household garbage from our neighbors, but didn't      try to get any from restaurants.    </p>    <p>      What you feed your hogs will depend on what's available      where you live and your ability to evaluate it. Don't be      afraid to ask questions and-if you tell someone      (politely) that his garbage isn't good enough for your      pigs-it might set him to thinking a little.    </p>    <p>      In selecting food for your hogs, remember that they're      omnivorous. That is, they both like and need (just like      humans!) a widely varied diet in order to receive all the      vitamins, minerals and protein that they require. The      following list is by no means exhaustive but will give you      an idea of some of the things that are good for pigs to      eat.    </p>    <p>      (1) CORN, GRAIN AND MINERAL SALT. The grain may be fed      whole but several varieties are usually mixed and ground      together. Corn is good but should not be used exclusively,      soybeans are essential for their high protein content and      rye is favored by many farmers in this area. Here is a      suggested mixture:    </p>        <p>      We fed this grain ration twice a day and added cracked corn      when the hogs got older. Whenever the pigs looked like they      were putting on too much weight, we stopped feeding the      extra corn for a while.    </p>    <p>      (2) FRUIT, VEGETABLES AND GREENS. If your garden is      unsprayed you can feel especially good about feeding the      pea vines, cabbage leaves, squash, cucumbers and melons to      your hogs. (They're sure to like the greens and their      favorite forage-pigweed [also called      lamb's-quarters]-is good eating for people as well as      hogs. If you've never had any, pick a mess of the young,      tender weeds this spring, clip off the roots and cook the      whole plant as you would spinach.) Canning time will      produce a bounty of peelings, core and pits for the pigs to      eat.    </p>    <p>      (3) MILK. Very good for pigs if you're lucky enough to have      a cow that produces a lot. For our piggers, milk came in      three forms: they got all the whey from my cheese making;      they received soured milk from a neighbor with a dairy      herd; and they were fed reconstituted powdered milk. The      whey and powdered milk were mixed with the hogs' grain      ration to make a "soup", but they preferred to eat the      clabbered, sour milk ungarnished.    </p>    <p>      (4) ALFALFA HAY. This growth food is rich in nitrogen,      which is an important constituent of protein. Our pigs      liked the hay so much that they rolled around in the forage      before they got down to the business of eating it.    </p>    <p>      (5) PASTURE. Good pasture can supply from 20 to 300 of a      pig's feed requirements, and one acre can feed twenty      100-lb. hogs. If you want to plant a pasture try alfalfa,      clover and rape . . . or a mixture of rape and oats.    </p>    <h3>BUTCHERING</h3>    <p>      If you have a tendency to grow sentimental toward your hogs      and postpone their butchering, remind yourself      that-by the time the porkers are six months      old-they'll be eating like mad and most of the garden      goodies will be gone. Butchering becomes a matter of      economic necessity to anyone who's not wealthy enough to      support such a hungry pet. If you still feel too      softhearted toward the pigs, or simply don't have the time      to undertake such a large job, a slaughterhouse will do the      work for you (for a reasonable fee) and return each animal      in two impersonal-looking halves which will be a little      easier for you to deal with.    </p>    <p>      If, however, you do intend to butcher your hogs-and      you've never slaughtered a large animal before-by all      means get some knowledge, experience or help (preferably      all three) before you begin. You can get the experience by      volunteering to help a friend or neighbor with his      butchering . . . and you might obtain some help by seeking      out a man fairly skilled in the art and offering him a      portion of meat in exchange for his services. If neither of      these avenues is open, go to the nearest slaughterhouse and      ask the owner if you may come and watch on his next hog      butchering day. Observe carefully, learn all you can and      ask the meat inspector to tell you how to check the glands      on the hog for TB or other disease. <em>(EDITORS NOTE: You      should also see pages 79-82 in MOTHER NO. 17, the article      immediately following this piece and the next two MOTHERS      for a serialized version of Morton Salt's excellent how-to      book on butchering.)</em>    </p>    <h3>SOME SPARE PARTS</h3>    <p>      When the old-timers slaughtered a hog, they utilized every      portion that was useful or edible . . . including the tripe      (intestines), head and feet. I'll have to confess that      Arthur and I have not yet made headcheese, pickled pigs'      feet or boiled tripe. Still I'm sure that these dishes can      be tasty as well as nutritional, and for the sake of      completeness I am including three recipes gleaned from old      books, but not supplemented by any experience on my part:    </p>    <h3>HEADCHEESE</h3>    <p>      Clean and scrape the hog's head and wash thoroughly. Thrust      a hot poker into ears and nostrils. Cover the head with      slightly salted water, add bay leaf and onion and simmer      for several hours until the meat falls from the bones.      Drain meat, pick it from the bones, shred it and season      with salt, pepper, sage and thyme. Pack the meat tightly      into a bowl or crock, add a small amount of the liquid in      which it was cooked, place a cover on top and weight the      cover down. Let stand for three days in a cold place while      the headcheese solidifies, then slice and serve cold like      luncheon meat.    </p>    <h3>PICKLED PIG'S FEET OR SOUSE</h3>    <p>      Scrape and wash the pig's feet, soak them in cold water far      two hours, wash and scrape again, then split the feet      lengthwise. Cook the hocks in salted water flavored with      vinegar, onion, sage, peppercorns and a few cloves. When      done, pack the feet in small crocks, and cover with the      water in which they were cooked. This liquid will form a      gelatinous mass. Place a lid on the crock and keep in a      cold place until needed for the table.    </p>    <h3>TRIPE</h3>    <p>      Tripe should be soaked for several hours for several then      scraped clean put into salted water and simmered for two or      three hour until it becomes jelly-like. Drain off the      liquid and set it aside for later use. Put a tablespoon of      butter into a saucepan. When the butter is hot add a      teaspoonful of flour and cook a few minutes, but do not      brown. Then slowly add one cup of milk and stir the mixture      until smooth. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, a dash of pepper and      1/2 teaspoon onion juice, then add one cup of boiled tripe      and stir until the tripe is heated. Serve immediately.    </p>    <p>      <em>THE NATURAL FOODS COOKBOOK</em> by Beatrice Trum Hunter      has several additional recipes for tripe.    </p>    <p>      Other portions of the hog that are more common to today's      table-but still might be unfamiliar to some-are      the heart, liver, kidneys and tongue. These organ meats are      extremely rich in nutrients, especially the B vitamins, and      should be eaten as fresh as possible for maximum food      value.    </p>    <p>      The simplest way to prepare liver, heart and kidneys is to      slice the meat and fry it with onions. The tongue must be      boiled first, then chilled in cold water so that the skin      may be peeled off: after that it can be eaten plain or made      into hash with onions and potatoes. For a variety of      recipes using these organ meats, I will again refer you to      <em>THE NATURAL FOODS</em> <em>COOKBOOK.</em>    </p>    <h3>RENDERING LARD</h3>    <p>      The fatty pieces which cling to the intestines, ribs and      other parts of a hog may be rendered into lard. Before the      availability of vegetable oils, this lard served the family      for baking (it makes a beautiful, snowy pie crust), frying,      preserving food and soap making. It was also a barter stock      in trade. Whatever you intend to do with yours, however,      the first step-which removes excess moisture and      prevents spoilage-is called rendering. The operation      is usually done outside because of the odor it produces:    </p>    <p>      Wash and chill the fat trimmings and cut them into small      chunks. Then place the pieces in a heavy kettle (but do not      fill it full) and cook slowly at 210-212°F, while      stirring to prevent sticking. The temperature will rise as      the water evaporates, but do not let it go higher than      255°F. As the water evaporates, brown cracklings will      begin to float. Remove them . . . otherwise they'll sink to      the bottom and burn. The lard will be done when the steam      ceases to rise. If the lard is intended for consumption,      strain it through cheesecloth; if not, place it directly      into clean crocks. Cover and store in a cool, dry place.    </p>    <p>      Not too many years ago, the "cracklings" from the lard were      a highly prized delicacy. I remember crunching on      them-hot and crispy from the oven-myself.      People didn't worry about cholesterol then, and they      probably had no reason to, since they got a lot of      exercise. If you want to try cracklings, they can be eaten      plain, mixed with flour and made into biscuits or mixed      with cornmeal and made into Pennsylvania Dutch scrapple.    </p>    <h3>      PARTS OF A HOG    </h3>        <p>      1.

Head    </p>    <h3>SAUSAGE</h3>    <p>      Besides the fatty pieces that you've rendered into lard,      there will be-after the cutting up-a number of      "trimmings". Rejoice, for these small pieces of meat that      don't seem to belong anywhere are the stuff that sausage is      made of.    </p>    <p>      The following instructions are for making sausage patties      rather than the link sausages (which require packing the      meat into cases made from the pig's intestines). As far as      I can see, the sausage patties taste every bit as good and      they're a whole lot easier to prepare.    </p>    <p>      First cut the meat that is to be used into chunks small      enough to fit into the meat grinder. The recommended      proportions are two parts lean meat to one part fat, but      you don't need to follow that formula slavishly. Just use      what you have. Then, for each pound of meat add one      teaspoon salt, one teaspoon ground pepper and one teaspoon      ground sage. This is the basic seasoning for sausage and is      usually quite satisfactory, though you might want to      experiment by adding some savory, allspice, cloves, ginger      or sugar. The first time you make sausage it might be a      good idea to try only a half-pound. After this is ground,      you can fry some, taste it and then add either more meat or      more seasonings to suit your taste.    </p>    <p>      Run the meat through the grinder twice to pulverize it and      mix in the spices. That's all there is to it! Shape the      meat into patties, wrap each one in wax paper (so there's a      double layer between) and put them in the freezer. To      preserve sausage without freezing, place the patties in      sterilized jars or crocks, and pour half an inch of lard      over them. The lard excludes the air and-as long as the      coating isn't broken and the crocks are kept cool-the      sausage should keep indefinitely.    </p>    <h3>SCRAPPLE</h3>    <p>      Scrapple, it would seem, can be made from just about any      part of the hog that one might choose. Some use cracklings      and others neck bones as the major ingredient. We make ours      from sausage the way that Arthur's father used to do back      in New York State. The following recipe was reconstructed      from memory and the measurements are approximate.    </p>    <p>      First cook one cup of rolled oats in enough water (about 2      cups) to make a thick porridge. Then do the same thing with      a cup of cornmeal. Now mix these two cereals, add a pound      of sausage and some more sausage seasoning. Pack the      mixture into a bowl or crock, chill until firm, cut into      slices and fry thoroughly. Serve the scrapple plain or      dripping with maple syrup!    </p>    <h3>CUTTING UP</h3>    <p>      Now that we've disposed of the various small parts of the      hog, let's get back to those two huge chunks of pork that      are hanging out in the cold. The accompanying diagrams (see      Figures 1 and 2) show two ways of looking at a hog, and      should help the novice understand what cut of meat comes      from where. I will not attempt to give detailed      instructions for cutting up the meat, because this will      depend largely upon how you want to use it. <em>(EDITOR'S      NOTE: See Morton Salt book installment following this      article.)</em>    </p>    <h3>CURING</h3>    <p>      There are two methods of curing to consider: the dry cure      in which the salt mixture is rubbed on the meat, and the      wet cure where the meat is immersed in brine. Some people      prefer the dry method because it requires less handling of      the meat. We like a wet cure because we think it offers      more insurance against insect damage and spoilage. Some      folks do larger cuts by the dry cure method and use a wet      cure on smaller pieces of meat.    </p>    <p>      Regardless of which method you use, first weigh each piece      to be cured, rub it with fine salt and allow the meat to      drain, flesh side down, for 6 to 12 hours. Then proceed:    </p>    <h3>DRY CURE</h3>    <p>      For each 100 pounds of meat use:    </p>    <p>      6-8 lbs. of salt (use the greater amount in warm      weather)<br />      2-2 1/2 lbs. brown sugar, molasses or syrup<br />      2 ounces saltpeter (available from drugstore or meat      packing plant)<br />      5 ounces black pepper, ground<br />      optional: sage, savory or pickling spices or . . .    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Do NOT omit the saltpeter from this      recipe!</strong><br /></em>    </p>    <p>      Mix the ingredients well and rub the mixture over all the      surfaces of the meat . . . then pack the pork in a barrel,      tight wooden box or crock. The heavier pieces should be      placed on the bottom, with the bacon and smaller chunks on      top. After about three days, take the meat out and repack      it to insure complete contact with the cure. Leave the pork      until the cure is completed . . . this will take two days      for each pound that each piece weighs. Thus, a 10-pound ham      will take 20 days in cure while a 4-pound piece of bacon      will be finished in only 8 days. The liquid formed from the      meat juices will aid in curing the heavier pieces.    </p>    <h3>WET CURE</h3>    <p>      For each 100 lbs. of meat use:    </p>    <p>      9-10 lbs. of medium grain salt (use more salt in warm      weather)<br />      2-2 1/2 lbs, brown sugar or 4 lbs. unsulphured molasses or      maple syrup<br />      2 ounces saltpeter<br />      4-4 1/2 gallons of water    </p>    <p>      First note the weight of each piece of pork and add the      figures to get the total number of pounds of meat so that      you can make up the required amount of brine. Pack the pork      into crocks and fill them with water. Then remove the meat,      pour the water into a kettle, add the preserving      ingredients and mix up the curing brine. Ideally, this      brine should be prepared a day ahead to insure its complete      dissolution. Then the meat is packed in the      crocks-with the largest cuts on the bottom-and      covered with the brine.    </p>    <p>      Our instructions said to top each container with a hardwood      cover and weight it down with a stone . . . but we didn't      have any such lids so we laid a length of 2 by 4 across the      top of every crock, weighted it down and wedged bottles      between the beam and the chunks of pork in order to keep      the meat submerged. Obviously, such an arrangement needs to      be checked frequently since the meat mustn't be allowed to      rise out of the brine. It's a good idea to pour the      solution off about once a week, take the meat out and      repack it in a different position.    </p>    <p>      Try to keep the crocks cool but not cold because, in spite      of the large quantity of salt it contains, this solution      will freeze if the temperature drops low enough. I'm not      sure how cold it got in our spare room last year when the      outside temperature fell to zero and below . . . but our      brine froze and we had to move the crocks into the kitchen.    </p>    <p>      If the brine becomes "ropy"-which means that a scurry      forms on its top-empty the crocks, wash them out and      wash the meat thoroughly. It's then best to repack the pork      in fresh brine but-if this isn't possible-you can      salvage the original solution by boiling (but not burning!)      it and skimming off the impurities.    </p>    <p>      The large pieces, like the hams, will require four days in      cure for each pound of meat . . . thus a 20-pound ham will      take 80 days! (Country living builds patience.)    </p>    <p>      The smaller pieces, like bacon, need only three days in      cure per pound . . . so a five-pound piece of bacon will be      ready in 15 days. Make yourself a chart showing when each      chunk a meat should come out and post it on the wall      somewhere. Sow every piece of pork in clean water for half      an hour when it's taken out of the brine and - if by      chance a chunk has cured too long - leave it an extra      three minutes in the water for each day overtime in cure.    </p>    <p>      If your pieces of meat are all of different sizes, you may      find yourself taking each one out at a different time. We      tried to group ours by leaving some pieces in a few days      extra and soaking them to compensate for the overcure. This      way, we could smoke several pieces of meat at a time.    </p>    <h3>SMOKED MEAT</h3>    <p>      In order to smoke meat, one must either have a smokehouse      or-as we do-access to a neighbor's. The      building we use is made of wood, about three feet deep by      five feet wide and eight feet high at the center of its      peaked roof. A metal shield is propped against the back      wall, a fire built on the dirt floor and the smoke allowed      to escape under the eaves and through the shingled roof.    </p>    <p>      Most of the instructions and plans for building smokehouses      feature a fire pit removed from the smokehouse itself . . .      possibly for safety and efficiency. But all the smokehouses      that I've ever seen in use have been the simple walk-in      wooden buildings like the one owned by our neighbor. It's      probably matter of individual taste. In building your      smokehouse, don't be too concerned with providing vents      through which the smoke can escape. The purpose is to hold      the smoke in . . . it'll find its own way out.    </p>    <p>      Figure 3 shows a smoker-suitable for small quantities      of meat-made from a barrel, placed on an incline and      connected to a cement fire pit by means of a buried metal      pipe.    </p>    <p>      For larger quantities and/or frequent use, a larger      smokehouse is in order. Figure 4 shows such a design set      over a pit and connected by a trench to a fire pit dug in      the ground. The trench and fire pit are covered with sheet      metal and the building has a false bottom - bored      with holes for the smoke to pass through - about a      foot above ground level.    </p>    <p>      These instructions and diagrams will give you an idea of      what can be done . . . combine them, improvise and see what      you can come up with. As a finishing touch, be sure to add      poles-either of metal or green wood-from which      to hang the meat.    </p>    <p>      Remember that the principle in smoking is to allow the      pyroligneous acid in the smoke to permeate and slightly dry      the meat without cooking it. The longer and more slowly a      piece of meat is smoked, the longer it will keep. If the      meat is overheated, it will soften and fall into the fire;      if it's scorched, it'll harden, crack and turn rancid. The      ideal temperature for smoking is between 110 and 120°      F.    </p>    <p>      Armed with this information and with your smokehouse in      order, you're ready to proceed. (We assume your meat has      been properly cured, taken out on time, soaked and washed.      You may want to wrap it in cheesecloth to keep off the      soot, but this is not essential.)    </p>    <p>      Pass either a string or wire through the meat and form a      loop around the pole. Hams should be hung with the heavier      side up and the hock hanging down to retain the flavorful      juices. The pieces of meat should not touch one another so      that the smoke can circulate freely to all parts. Check      each chunk for pieces that are "folded over" in a way that      would prevent smoke penetration.    </p>    <p>      Use chips, sawdust and small pieces of wood for the fire. .      . keeping in mind that it's smoke you're after, not heat.      Apple, hickory, beech, sassafras, maple and other fruit and      nut woods are all suitable. <em>Do not use resinous      woods.</em> We got a lot of different advice about smoking:      some people say to smoke constantly, others say smoke every      second day. So we did it the way that was most convenient      for us . . . we kept the fire going during the day and let      it go out at night.    </p>    <p>      There are widely differing opinions-ranging from 2      days up to 10 weeks!-on how long meat should be      smoked. Again we relied on our own judgment and that of our      neighbor, who pronounced the bacon finished at the end of      the third day and the hams on the fifth. The only      criterion, apparently, is appearance . . . properly smoked      meat should have from a light to dark mahogany color all      over. The darker the color, the longer the meat will keep.    </p>    <p>      By the time you've tended the smokehouse for several days,      your mouth will surely be watering for some of that      well-earned meat. . . and it's probably extraneous to tell      you that the bacon and hams should "season" for another 30      to 60 days to insure the best flavor. No doubt you'll start      eating your product immediately . . . but for the pieces      that you <em>can't</em> eat right away, here's how to go      about storing them:    </p>    <p>      Optimal storage conditions are cool (43°F) and dry.      This will discourage one of the main problems, which is      insects, because they don't like dryness. For added      protection, you can either (1) wrap the meat in cheesecloth      or similar material, followed by layers of newspaper, and      store in heavy paper bags, tied at the top or (2) wrap the      meat in muslin and bury it in boxes containing ashes      retrieved from the smoking. The ashes are supposed to      increase the smoky flavor and this last method sounds like      a good way to put away a ham until Easter time!    </p>
