                    <h5 id="byline">      By SHIRLEY PARENTEAU    </h5>        <p>      A few years ago my teen-age son, David, became interested      in antique bottles when the highway department dug through      an area used as a dump by the settlers of a nearby city.      Collectors who learned of the discovery turned out in      droves and that field was churned and sifted and dug      through until it looked like a battleground. Glassware came      from the dirt in every variety and color. There were      drugstore jars with names and emblems forming a raised      design . . . graceful wine bottles and tiny opium vials . .      . "punkinseed" whiskey flasks and odd-shaped food and      cosmetic containers. All were old and, when David pointed      out that all were valuable to collectors, our whole family      became interested.    </p>    <p>      Soon afterward, my parents bought an old home in the Oregon      Cascades. When we helped them rototill the back yard for a      garden, every churned-up furrow brought to light bits of      glass, old bottles and even little porcelain dolls. We      checked and, sure enough, collectors again were more than      willing to buy our finds.    </p>    <h3>COLLECTABLES ARE BIG BUSINESS</h3>    <p>      The fascination in collecting anything old seems to grow      stronger and appeal to more people every year, all across      the country. You can profit, even establish a homestead      business, by finding these buried riches and selling them      to the folks who want them.    </p>        <h3>BOTTLES ARE WHERE YOU FIND THEM</h3>    <p>      You don't have to live on an old homestead to take part in      this treasure hunt either, as long as you can get      permission to explore and dig on private property. When      you're biking or hiking, watch for signs of old homesteads,      lumber camps, mining towns, railroad stations . . . any      place where people gathered and left trash behind. All are      potential treasure troves.    </p>    <p>      Coins and watches sometimes slipped through wooden      sidewalks and floors. Children played with silver spoons      and left them buried. Banks were few and unreliable, so      many people hid their savings . . . then sometimes forgot      or were unable to return for the cache. And everywhere,      empty bottles were tossed aside . . . where they still wait      for you to find them.    </p>    <p>      Go over these sites with a sharp eye. Watch for bottles,      glass insulators, iron toys, buttons, stamps, license      plates, old checks, spoons, campaign buttons, even barbed      wire. Anything old will attract a buyer.    </p>    <p>      Early homesteaders usually had no central dump. They tossed      their bottles and other trash under the house, into      streams, along fences, down ravines or into the outhouse.    </p>    <p>      A metal detector is helpful, but not essential, for      locating such refuse today. Just imagine yourself in the      shoes of the original settler and look for the most likely      dump site. Some trash may still be above ground so watch      for broken crockery, amethyst-colored glass and      rusting tin cans with soldered-instead of modern      rolledseams.    </p>    <p>      A few bottle hunters use long metal rods to locate buried      items but you should go easy if you try such a probe. Old      glass breaks with little effort and it's a heart-sinking      feeling to find you've knocked a chunk from a valuable      bottle.    </p>    <p>      When you discover a dump, it's best to use a hand      trowel-or even a table knife-to safely loosen      the bottles you find from the packed soil. Take along a box      and plenty of newspapers to wrap around the glassware you      unearth.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, to be absolutely sure to get permission      before treasure hunting on any land, occupied or not. Then      check attics and basements, door and window frames, under      the main building, barn and outhouse . . . and find that      dump!    </p>        <h3>BOTTLES</h3>    <p>      The value of old bottles and jars depends on condition and      scarcity. Containers common on one coast will often be rare      on the other. Favorites that bring the highest prices from      collectors are historical flasks, bitters, whiskey and      poison bottles. More common and less valuable are medicine,      condiment and cosmetic containers, Mason jars and ink      wells. A Jim Beam centennial whiskey bottle, for instance,      can sell for $60 or more while drugstore      bottles-which may bring as little as      50 cents-seem to average from $3 to $10.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO IDENTIFY A VALUABLE BOTTLE</h3>    <p>      <strong>MOLD SEAM LINES:</strong> On newer, machine-made      glassware, the seam line runs all the way to the top. On      older bottles, the lip was applied after the container was      removed from the mold and the seam stops at the lip.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PONTIL MARKS:</strong> Many hand-blown bottles will      have a small, jagged spot on the bottom. These were caused      by a steel rod called a <em>pontil</em> which was used to      remove the container from the blowpipe, then broken away.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COLOR:</strong> Sunlight turns old glass a      beautiful amethyst, adding to its value. Minerals in the      ground may cause rainbow coloring called opalization. This      can be beautiful, but may detract from the value and is      nearly impossible to remove.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IMPERFECTIONS:</strong> Old glass often shows      bubbles, crooked necks, uneven thickness of bottoms or neck      edges and so on. Value increases with the number of      imperfections.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RAISED LETTERING AND DESIGNS:</strong> These      increase the value and the appeal of old bottles.    </p>    <h3>INSULATORS</h3>    <p>      Telephone and telegraph wires have been strung from glass      insulators-to prevent current leakage-almost      from the time the wires were invented (telegraph insulators      date back to 1844 or 1845, and telephone insulators to      1876).    </p>    <p>      Like bottles, glass insulators come in a variety of colors      and shapes. You may find them in blue, deep green, or      aqua-green glass, sun-colored amethyst, white milk glass      and-if you're lucky-even in carnival or      cranberry glass.    </p>    <p>      The bell-shaped glasses were molded in a variety of sizes      and shapes. Some have inner "skirts", while others have      just the outer bell. Some feature sharp or rounded      drop-points on the bottom-meant to cause moisture to      drip to the ground instead of seeping inside the      glass-and others have smooth bottoms.    </p>    <p>      The value of insulators-like bottles-depends on      age, scarcity, color and beauty. Values range from $2 or $3      for the more common insulators to the rare types that bring      $25, $35 or more.    </p>    <p>      You're not likely to find these insulators in dumps because      they were usually dropped along the lines when they were      replaced. In many cases, the entire wire was abandoned and      the insulators are still on the old unused lines along      poles or buildings.    </p>    <h3>BARBED WIRE</h3>    <p>      Joseph Glidden, an Illinois settler, first saw the need for      lightweight fencing and-with his wife's      help-used a farm kitchen coffee mill to fasten bits      of twisted metal to a long strand of wire.<br />    </p>    <p>      The use of barbed wire then grew rapidly and the fencing      played a bloody role in the cattleman-farmer range wars      which raged throughout the late 1800's. Today, the history      and many variations of the fencing fascinate collectors who      buy 18-inch "sticks" of the old wire.    </p>    <p>      Over 800 different patents of barbed wire have been      recorded. There are variations in the twist, the barb, the      way of attaching the barb, the number of barbs per foot and      so on. Some wires look like rick-rack. Others have points      soldered on. There are round barbs with jagged edges and      barbs that are twisted around the main strand.    </p>    <p>      Barbed wire variations seem endless and collectors are      eager to add to the specimens they own. Sticks of the more      common patterns sell for 50 cents each, while rare      varieties bring as much as $100.    </p>    <p>      Barbed Wire Collector's Associations have been formed in at      least nine states. Membership runs into the hundreds, with      regularly scheduled exhibitions and swapping meets.    </p>    <h3>WHERE TO SELL YOUR FINDS</h3>    <p>      Hundreds of junk and antique dealers across the country      handle bottles and other collectables. You'll find them      listed in phone books under <em>ANTIQUES</em> -      <em>DEALERS.</em> Keep in mind, though, that-while      dealers buy more at a time-private collectors will      pay more for individual items.    </p>    <p>      You can reach those private collectors with newspaper ads      and garage sales of your antiques. Flea markets-where      you can usually rent a table for about $5-are      excellent places to sell your treasures.    </p>    <p>      A number of antique collectors' magazines carry ads for      people who wish to buy or sell a multitude of items. One of      the most helpful is SPINNING WHEEL, a publication which      carries monthly lists of flea markets and antique shows      scheduled across the country . . . as well as a selection      of antique dealers, their addresses and their areas of      interest.    </p>    <p>      SPINNING WHEEL also contains an extensive "Antiques      Shopping Center" for both buyers and sellers. The May '72      Buying Column Ads placed by individual collectors and      dealers included such wanted items as old political      documents, military medals, mechanical banks, old books,      unusual fruit jars, campaign buttons, glass paperweights,      old coins, railroad items, insulators, Coca-Cola trays and      old beer cans.    </p>    <p>      If your library doesn't carry the magazine, you can order a      single copy, postpaid, for 75 cents from SPINNING WHEEL,      Exchange Place, Hanover, Pa. 17331.    </p>    <p>      Your library may have a copy of A.T. Evans' <em>TREASURE      HUNTER'S YEARBOOK.</em> In addition to treasure hunt      stories and hints, each copy of this annual carries a      bottle club directory and the 1970-71 issue lists names and      addresses of 96 bottle clubs located in nearly every state      including Hawaii. Another section in the Evans annual lists      names and addresses (and, sometimes, meeting places and      times) for 30 treasure clubs. The yearbook is available for      $4 from Eureka Press, P.O. Box 1215, Odessa, Texas 79760.    </p>    <h3>ONE FINAL TIP</h3>    <p>      Scenic checks, so popular with banks today, have spawned a      new group of collectors. If your hunting turns up any old      checks, you can learn their value by contacting the Check      Collectors Round Table, P.O. Box 27112, Cincinnati, Ohio      45227.    </p>        <h3>editor's note</h3>    <p>      When I first read this piece I thought it was a nice little      idea but that no one could really expect to make more than      pin money dealing in old bottles. Then I remembered a      genial young con man who-when I met him a couple      years back-was making almost his entire living with      these collectables.    </p>    <p>      What this guy had done, see, was move into a tumbledown      garage in a little town in upstate New York. And that      garage-which had closed as a business probably 30 or      40 years before-had a back room stacked full of      canisters and jugs and vials and jars and bottles of      ancient polish, wax, liniment, carb cleaner and Lord knows      what all. About once every two months our hero put three or      four bushel baskets of his booty in the trunk of his car,      drove to Dayton, Ohio to visit his folks . . . and unloaded      the old glassware for enough to cover living expenses until      the next trip.    </p>    <p>      And where did the "con man" part come in? Well, as I      recall, the young man in question seemed to grease his      sales by visiting a different antique shop on every journey      . . . and then sort of letting on to the owner that he had      spent years collecting the bottles in question and that      there weren't really any more where they had come from. I      can't say that I endorse this mild deception, though . . .      and, the way old bottles are selling nowadays, it isn't      necessary anyway.-J.S.    </p>
