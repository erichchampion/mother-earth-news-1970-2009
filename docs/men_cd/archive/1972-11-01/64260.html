                    <p>      SPECIAL NOTE: <em>GROW IT!</em> is a big book and even if a      chunk this size were to be run in issue after issue after      issue of MOTHER, it would take over two years to put the      complete volume in your hands. If you haven't got two years      to play around with, we recommend that you truck on down to      your nearest book store and shell out $8.95 for your very      own copy of <em>GROW IT!</em> That way, Richard Langer will      be happy, Saturday Review Press will be happy . . . and      we're betting that you'll be happy too. It's a darn good      book.    </p>    <p>      At last! For the first time since the HAVE-MORE Plan was      published way back in the 1940's, a fellow named Richard W.      Langer has come up with a 365-page book that really      introduces a beginner to small-scale farming. Wanna raise      your own fruit, nuts, berries, vegetables, grain, chickens,      pigs, ducks, geese and honeybees? GROW IT! tells you how to      get started, we like it, and here's another chapter from      the book.    </p>    <p>      EXTRA SPECIAL NOTE: All material here reprinted from      <em>GROW IT!</em> Copyright © 1972 by Richard W.      Langer.    </p>            <p>      <em>If I could play on Homer's lyre<br />      And wing with true poetic fire<br />      To what great theme Would 1 aspire?<br />      Barnyard manure!</em>    </p>    <p>      -Alfred Vivian    </p>    <p>      Everything on a farm doesn't smell like roses. On the other      hand, manure is nowhere near as odoriferous as the average      city dweller thinks, and a well-made compost heap doesn't      smell at all. Your farm needs both.    </p>    <p>      Almost from the time man first began domesticating farm      animals, barnyard manure - the livestock's excretions      mixed with bedding material - was used as a      fertilizer to increase the yield of his crops. Some ancient      agrarian civilizations, such as the Mayan, never went into      animal husbandry on a large scale. It is now hypothesized      that many once-great cultures were destroyed not by war,      but by the exhaustion of the land surrounding their cities.      The local agriculture could no longer support the urban      population. All for the want of manure the fabled cities      fell? Quite likely.    </p>    <p>      Agriculturalists used to believe that plants literally      "ate" the soil. But with the birth of Justus von Liebig in      1803, the seed of radical change was planted in      agriculture. Liebig's contributions to civilization were      many and diverse, ranging from baking powder to chloroform.      Among the discoveries backed by his chemical laboratory was      the fact that plants merely extract certain substances from      the soil, specifically, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash.    </p>    <p>      From Liebig's new theory there were several corollaries to      be drawn, and the nineteenth-century assault on traditional      agriculture was soon in full sway. If you added enough of      the right chemicals, you could even grow a bumper crop in      candor, for that matter, in a water solution. The chemical      industry rose to the challenge, and Malthus's dragon was      slain. There would be food enough for everyone.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, as with all radical theories that presume to      save the world by sweeping away the entirety of man's past      endeavors, chemical fertilization and its adjunct,      insecticides, did. not turn out to be the panacea expected.      Kept in its place, not all chemical agriculture is      necessarily evil. But by overshad owing developments in the      other areas of agricultural research, test- tube farming      has done enough damage so that it could well take another      century to reclaim once bountiful farmlands from their      artificially imposed fallowness. And the damage done by the      insecticides in the long run will prove to far outweigh the      good.    </p>    <p>      What happened was that chemical fertilizers alone were      suddenly deemed the essential ingredients of agriculture.      No heed was paid any longer to the tilth, or physical      quality of the soil. What did the soil matter? Just add      more chemicals if your corn wasn't growing and everything      would be all right. The only problem was, as more and more      chemicals were added over the years, the organic quality of      the soil was lost. Once friable, rich earth turned into      hardpan. The essential chemical ingredients were there all      right . . . the high crop yields weren't. The reason?      Simple. You can't grow abundance on macadam.    </p>    <p>      Finally, in the past couple of decades agriculturalists      rediscovered soil-good, natural, organic earth, the way it      used to be, and the natural cycle that nourished it. For      instance, when you feed your goat hay, you're feeding it      plants that took their nutrients from the soil. But the      goat doesn't use all the nutrients in the plants. Save the      manure and return it to the field, and you're returning      nutrients the soil can use to feed the plants to feed the      goat . . . . . Manuring, trash mulching, and plowing under      cover crops are all ways of restoring the natural organic      balance of the earth.    </p>    <p>      With that in mind, you'll no doubt use your manure rather      than let it rot behind the barn. But you also want the best      manure possible - yes, even the manure on your farm      can be improved - and that takes a bit of planning.    </p>    <h3>BARNYARD MANURE:</h3>    <p>      GETTING QUALITY MANURE<br />    </p>    <p>      The kind of manure you get from your farm your animals      depends partly on the kind of livestock you have and what      they've beer eating. Animals on a good diet will make      better manure. This is why it's so important to think of      the farm as an organic whole, a small closed system      operating on a cycle of its own. Every improvement you make      at one point in the cycle will improve the following parts      of the cycle. Feeding your stock the best will result in      not only better meat, milk, or eggs, but better manure as      well, which when spread on the fields will give better,      more nourishing crops, which in turn . . , and on and on.      But break into the cycle negatively - skimp on the      feed, or let the manure go to waste - and you      introduce a declining spiral of quality into your      homestead.    </p>    <p>      In general, the quality of manure increases with the amount      of protein in the animals' diet. More protein means      higher-quality manure. This is the reason why horses, whose      diet is strong on grain, produce one of the most valued      manures.    </p>    <p>      Exceptions to this general rule are young animals, busy      growing, and their mothers, busy making milk. They won't      produce quite as nutritious manure as the rest of a herd      even on the same good diet, because both lactation and body      development use up larger quantities of calcium, phosphoric      acid, and nitrogen. Technical considerations like these      can't always be taken into account, obviously. If you're      raising goats for milk, you want the milk . . . the manure      is a by-product. You're not going to stop breeding the doe      just to improve the manure. You'll simply plan on using      more manure per acre during lactation than when the goat is      in its dry period. If you buy manure, on the other hand,      and are given a choice between that from dairy cows and      that from beef cows being fattened, you'll want to choose      the latter.    </p>    <p>      Buying or bartering for manure is not something one      normally thinks of in the city. In fact, it's not something      many chemical farmers would consider either. But it makes a      lot of sense. If you look at your farm as the closed      circuit it essentially is, you can see how bringing in      manure from outside is adding quality. Whoever sells it to      you is actually giving up a very valuable part of his land.      Up to 80 percent of all the nutrients gathered by farm      animals in foraging is expelled in their manure - the      body can utilize only so much of the overall nourishment it      receives. So letting manure go to waste is almost like      strip-mining your farm.    </p>    <p>      Manure can lose nutrient value while still in the barn if      precautions are not taken. As much as a fourth of livestock      urine is lost because of floor leakage, considerably more,      needless to say, in old barns with drains to remove the      urine to cesspools "out back". A tight cement floor helps      retain it. So does good bedding such as dry oat straw.      Check the bedding twice a day. Gauge how much you spread      out and how much it absorbed. What you want to strive for      is balance: enough bedding to absorb all the urine and keep      the animals clean, but not so much that the sheer amount of      it gets out of hand, making the resulting manure mostly      straw. Bedding contributes important nutrients of its own      to the all-over manure. However, too much of it, or rough      bedding such as cornstalks, may stay on top of a field long      after it's spread, rather than breaking down into humus.      When you're cutting your next hay crop later in the year,      the old bedding will be mixed with the new hay, and you'll      end up with a poor-quality crop. Also, of course, using      more bedding than you really need is a waste.    </p>    <p>      STORING THE MANURE <strong><br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Without proper care manure quickly loses many of its      beneficial qualities. Nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash      are lost through leaching, fermentation, and oxidation.      These processes can't be entirely prevented, but with      careful storage and protection the nutrient losses can be      kept to a minimum. Ideally, spreading manure (except      chicken) on the land and working it in immediately is the      best preventative. The thing that militates against the      small-scale farmer here is that in all probability he won't      be keeping enough livestock to produce a quantity of manure      sufficient to make immediate spreading worthwhile, except      maybe in the vegetable garden. So he must build up his      supply, from his own barn and/or his neighbor's. In either      case, he'll want to know it's kept well.    </p>    <p>      The richer the manure, the more rapidly it will lose its      value if not carefully stored. Proper storage means      protection from the elements. The old way of piling      droppings out back in scattered dumps is definitely out. If      you must store the manure in the open, it should be      collected in one heap, on a slightly concave concrete or      hard-packed clay floor to minimize liquid loss. Pile it      high, pack it tightly, and make the sides steep. Dent the      top a little, forming a depression to collect rainwater.      This will prevent the rain from eroding down the sides and      washing away nutrients. At the same time, it will keep the      manure moist. In dry, windy weather you'll have to wet down      the heap somewhat to prevent burning, or overdrying of the      manure. With overdrying, it turns white, indicating there      has been considerable nitrogen loss and even some shrinkage      of organic quantity.    </p>    <p>      The best way to store manure is in covered concrete pits.      Again, the manure should be packed tightly and moistened      when necessary. Thus cosily stored, manure will keep well      for months. The pit has the additional advantage that it      can be used for the production of rotted manure if you      happen to have a bumper crop of manure around sometime.      Rotted manure is simply aged manure, usually that which has      been stored over four to six months. The rotting reduces      the total weight of the manure by almost half, but since      the weight is lost much more rapidly than the nutrients,      well-rotted manure is still good manure, merely in more      concentrated form. This means less of a load to haul, and      some farmers with plenty of manure around prefer to work      with it rotted. Also, in the case of some plants, fresh      manure will cause fertilizer burn. To avoid this,      well-rotted, or aged, manure is used instead.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPREADING THE MANURE</strong> <strong><br />      </strong>    </p>    <p>      If you've stored manure well, it can be spread on the      fields at your convenience. Often this means you'll be      spreading it in the wintertime, when other work to be done      on the farm is at its nadir of the yearly cycle. Spreading      manure in winter is fine, so long as the fields aren't      covered too deeply with snow, since that would leave the      manure exposed to weathering.    </p>    <p>      A manure spreader can cover in two hours a field that would      take you two months with a shovel and wheelbarrow. So it's      a real necessity. You can pick up an old out-of-date model      very reasonably at a local farm auction that will still      serve the small farm well. Till such time as you can buy      one of your own, borrow your neighbor's. If you're buying      or bartering manure from him, usually you'll find he will      also help you spread it. Or perhaps you can have your      spreading done by what's known as a "custom man". The      custom man has been a rural tradition ever since modern      labor-saving devices came to the farm. In most small-farm      areas you find farmers with more machinery than their      neighbors who want to maximize the utilization of their      equipment and thus will offer to use it on their neighbors'      land for pay.    </p>    <p>      The amount of manure to apply to your fields varies with      the crops you plant. Truck crops may need thirty tons or      more per acre. With hay crops, one ton per acre will      produce a good increase in yield, two tons will almost      double the yield, three tons will do even better. But there      can be too much of a good thing. If you apply eight or ten      tons of manure per acre of hay, the nitrogen concentration      may become high enough to cause lodging. That is to say,      too much nitrogen weakens grass stalks, and the hay mats      down to the ground, making it difficult, if not impossible,      to harvest. Lodged hay, whether caused by excess nitrogen,      a heavy rain, or hail, is not a total loss, since it can be      turned over as green manure. But it was a hay crop you were      after. Four to five tons of manure per acre per crop is a      good average for most soil conditions. Find out what your      neighbors are spreading - especially the one with a      farm you admire - and what they think of your      acreage. They won't be able to give you absolute figures to      rely on, but between their ideas and those of your county      agent or local agricultural experiment station you'll begin      to have a feel for what's needed.    </p>    <p>      All right then, you may be thinking, if it's going to take      tons of manure to fertilize the fields, it's hopelessly out      of the question. After all, you were planning on a couple      of pigs and goats, or maybe just a few chickens. They'd get      you nowhere. Or would they? Four growing pigs will give you      almost twelve tons of liquid and solid manure a year. Three      goats will give you four tons, thirty chickens two tons.      The combined amount of manure from even relatively little      livestock is often enough for the acreage in actual use on      a small farm.    </p>    <h3>GREEN MANURE:</h3>    <p>      Not all manure comes from animals. Manure is anything that      through its decay introduces organic matter and nutrient,      into the soil in compensation for that removed by crops,      live stock, and the elements. Green manure, a crop raised      for the express purpose of being plowed under, is as much a      fertilize as barnyard manure . . . it's just a different      kind. Plowing under returns the organic matter of the crop      to the soil. In the case of legumes, the most desirable      green manure crops, the soil is given additional nitrogen      as well. Most plants get their nitrogen from the soil, but      legumes, with the aid of certain specific bacteria, have      the ability to extract nitrogen from the air.    </p>    <p>      Green manure is a work-saver as well as a fertilizer. A      large part of the organic material derived from green      manure is in the form of decaying roots. Alfalfa roots, for      instance, grow four or five feet deep into the soil. When      the plants are turned over, the roots break down, or      decompose, into organic matter at their tips as well as      their tops. So water retention and soil quality improve all      the way down. To plow those four or five feet deep      yourself, you'd have to use dynamite. It's literally been      done.    </p>    <p>      The amount of organic matter retained by the soil is      obviously not equal to the total volume of green manure      plowed under. For one thing, as the crop breaks down, it      shrinks. In addition, during decay some of it disappears      into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Then again, how much      organic matter is retained depends in part on the initial      quality of the soil Loamy and clay soil will retain more      than sand. Temperature is also an important factor. During      hot weather more of the potential organic soil-builder is      lost in the form of carbon dioxide than in cool weather.      The worst possible combination is sandy soil and tropical      heat.    </p>    <p>      Green manuring will not convert your acreage into a wonder      field over one winter. Very little permanent organic matter      is added to the soil by plowing under. Even with the best      of conditions it may take almost half a century to double      the organic matter in the soil. But done wherever possible      every year, green manuring will prevent the deterioration      of soil quality while improving it enough to increase the      yield of the cash crop you plant next on the field by      anywhere from 10 percent to 100 percent. A cash crop,      incidentally, isn't necessarily one you sell for cash. It's      simply a crop that's grown to be used rather than turned      over into the field.    </p>    <p>      Organic matter in the soil is as much a <em>process</em> as      it is a substance. That is, the decay of matter is as      important as the material itself, for it is this process of      decay that releases the nutrients. The different stages of      decomposition give the soil different qualities. If a green      manure crop plowed under remained as whole dead plants in      the ground, the soil would resemble caked clay with hollows      and layers of straw. Not conducive to good crops. It is the      slow blending of decaying matter, the moisture it retains,      and the organic material that give the soil the desired      quality. The decay of the organic material continues till      there is nothing left. If no new organic matter is      introduced, only the claylike quality of the soil remains      - or the dustlike quality, as it loses its ability to      hold sufficient moisture. This is why organic matter must      be continuously returned to the earth. And why it takes so      long to build rich soil. For even as you turn over your      green manure crop, you're planning what to sow as a cash      crop on the same field the same year, a crop that, were man      not farming, would also have remained to nourish the soil.    </p>    <p>      Both grasses and legumes can be used for green manure.      Legumes, however, are preferable because they add nitrogen      to the soil as well as organic matter.    </p>    <p>      <em>Inoculation.</em> Legumes must be inoculated before      being planted. When I was a kid I thought someone sat      around the old seed company with a hypodermic needle giving      each little seed an injection. That isn't quite the case.      Legume inoculation is done with the suitable culture of      single-celled bacteria for the specific seed involved, but      on bushels of seed at a time, not individually. The      bacteria for clover won't work on alfalfa, or even sweet      clover. And don't let the word "bacteria" scare you. If the      clover variety won't touch the alfalfa, what do you think      the chances of its liking you are? Nil.    </p>            <p>      Inoculation refers to exposing the seeds to the bacteria,      using commercially available cultures, so each seed becomes      coated. The seeds must be inoculated the same day they are      to be planted, as the bacteria die when out of soil. A      culture usually comes in one-bushel size - a plastic      baggie with about a cupful of what looks like black soot.      Mix with water according to the accompanying instructions,      toss into a seed inoculator, or a homemade barrel version,      with a batch of seeds, and crank like old-fashioned ice      cream until the seeds and inoculating culture are well      mixed.    </p>    <p>      A field itself can be inoculated through previous plant      growth. For instance, soil upon which inoculated soybeans      have once grown will retain the bacteria long enough to      inoculate a subsequent crop of soybeans even if sown a year      later. The same holds true for most legumes.    </p>    <p>      Inoculation is not a preventative against anything. It's a      booster. When you want a solution to crystallize,      introducing a few ready-made crystals speeds up the      process. The same kind of thing is true of inoculation of      legumes. You supply nitrogen-fixing bacteria. As the plant      develops roots, the bacteria enter the root hairs,      immediately forming nodules that become regular little      nitrogen factories. The plant supplies the bacteria with      nutrients, the bacteria supply the plant with nitrogen. A      very productive symbiotic relationship that might still      have developed had the inoculation not taken place, but to      a much lesser extent and, in the case of a field where that      specific crop had never grown, perhaps not at all.<br />    </p>    <h3>CROPS FOR GREEN MANURE:</h3>    <p>      LEGUMES<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Sweet Clover.</em> First on your list, especially if      you have bees. One of the hardiest of the clovers, this one      comes predominantly in biennial form. Will do well in any      part of the country where rainfall exceeds eighteen inches,      well cycled throughout the year. It can be grown on most      types of soil as long as there has been adequate liming.      For the bees' honey harvest, let the crop stand till after      the blossom stage before you plow.    </p>    <p>      <em>Ladino Clover.</em> This clover is a rapid-growing      perennial two or three times the size of common clover. It      does best in the temperate climate of the northeastern      states, but is also grown in the Corn Belt. It does not      make good hay . . . however, it is excellent for turning      over.    </p>    <p>      <em>Alfalfa.</em> A deep-rooted perennial grown throughout      the United States. It fares particularly well in the      Midwest and Far West. Most soils will do, but extreme      sandiness, clayeyness, or poor drainage will inhibit growth      considerably. Good for green manure and hay. But the seeds      tend to be expensive.    </p>    <p>      <em>Trefoil.</em> Comes in two varieties, bird's-foot and      big trefoil, both native to Europe. Best adapted to a      temperate climate, it is grown chiefly in the northern half      of the United States, but can be cultivated anywhere. Big      trefoil is the hardier of the two, so moisture-hardy, in      fact, it can thrive under semiswamp conditions.    </p>    <p>      NONLEGUMES<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Rye.</em> Your first choice of the nonlegumes. Because      of its hardiness, rye is an excellent winter crop. That is      to say, you can plant it in fall, at which time it will      take root. Winter growth will be minimal but the crop will      have a real head start come spring. You can plow under a      winter rye crop as green manure before your regular spring      planting. Soil requirements for rye are not stringent. Can      be grown in any part of the country.    </p>    <p>      <em>Redtop.</em> The most widely adaptable cultivated grass      in the United States. Grows well in all parts of the      country except the extreme Southwest. Sometimes called      "herd's grass" in the South. Timothy, on the other hand, is      sometimes called "herd's grass" in the North. Same herd,      different grass.    </p>    <p>      <em>Timothy.</em> The most important hay grass in the      States, despite the fact that it is usually grown only      north of the thirty-sixth latitude. A perennial grass      growing in bunches, it will not grow in dry sandy soil,      needing heavy earth and an abundance of moisture.    </p>    <p>      PLOWING UNDER <strong><br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Your green manure crop must be turned over at least two      weeks - better yet, three weeks - before      planting a cash crop on the same field. Otherwise its      initial stages of decay will inhibit seed germination of      the new crop and prevent plant growth. After two to three      weeks, however, the decaying process will have progressed      to the point where the soil is ready to nourish newly sown      seeds. During warm weather, complete decomposition of the      green manure usually occurs in about six weeks. Disc      harrowing the plants two or three times before plowing them      under helps speed things along. Cut up, the plants will      decay more rapidly.    </p>    <h3>COMPOST</h3>    <p>      Your vegetable garden, like your fields, needs both animal      and green manure. But plowed-under green manure doesn't      really pay here, except as a winter crop to keep the land      from lying bare. Plowing under is best left to your larger      acreage of field crops. If you have a big vegetable garden      - that is, you've gone commercial and are growing      vegetables for market - you don't want to waste a      cash crop by growing green manure instead. If you have just      a small garden for your family, and maybe a roadside stand      on the side, the dimensions of the plot won't be large      enough to warrant the work of harrowing and plowing under.      Then what? Your soil still needs organic material.    </p>    <p>      Composting is the ideal solution. You make your garden's      own green manure in a compost pile, using all the excess      vegetable matter on your farm - for instance, spoiled      hay, plant tops from the garden, the straw from your wheat      harvest, leaves from your orchard. When it's properly aged,      spread it on the garden as you would animal manure. And      lest you think that because you have a pile of decaying      vegetable matter next to your garden the smell will be      overpowering - it won't. A well-constructed compost      pile doesn't smell at all.    </p>    <p>      Composting is a natural soil-building process that began      with the first plants on earth and has gone on ever since.      Leaves falling, ground cover wilting, trees felled,      deceased animals and insects decaying, all that once lived      gave up its life to the earth. Layers upon layers rotted      - not dust unto dust, but life into new life, for      from the decay new plants rose, feeding new insects and      animals in turn, all in an endless cycle. The compost heap      is nothing but an intensification of this natural process.      In a good compost heap decay-causing bacteria have an      almost ideal environment to multiply like gangbusters.      Hyperactive, these bacteria break down the raw material of      the compost so quickly that odors have no chance to      develop.    </p>    <h3>INGREDIENTS FOR THE COMPOST PILE</h3>    <p>      What's the best material to use for composting? just about      anything organic. The more variety, the better, because      some trace elements (those of which only the minutest      quantities are needed for plant growth) may be found in a      weed more than anywhere else, or in a type of hay, or      brewer's waste, or what have you. By mixing as many      different things (organic, of course) into the compost pile      as you have available, you can only help insure that the      compost becomes more nourishing. Some of the more common      ingredients are leaves fresh or old, hay, sawdust, wood      ashes, garbage, nut shells, garden trimmings, manufacturing      scraps such as dried blood, leather bits, sewage sludge,      coffee and cocoa hulls, feathers. If it once lived, it can      be reincarnated as a plant in your garden. But remember,      some animal manure should be added to each pile for its      nitrogen content. Chicken manure is excellent. If you have      no livestock when you first start, tankage, bone meal,      sewage sludge or dried blood available commercially can be      substituted for the manure. If this gives you the idea that      when you slaughter an animal you should add the blood to      your compost pile - that's right. And when you're      through eating, add the ground meat bones from the table.      Use everything on the farm for something. Waste is just      that: waste. The city cliff dweller has forgotten that      garbage is an integral part of life, <em>not</em> something      to throw away.    </p>    <h3>NO SHRED METHOD</h3>    <p>      The speediest composting is achieved by shredding the      materials used. They need not be ground up, but the smaller      the particle size, the more rapid the process. A fallen      hardwood tree in the forest may take a century to decay      into humus. If that tree had been reduced to sawdust and      mixed into a good compost heap, it would have yielded rich      humus in less than a month. It's the same difference as      that between putting a sugar lump and putting a spoonful of      fine granulated sugar into your coffee.    </p>    <p>      If you can't get a shredder right away, however, you can      still build an excellent compost heap that will yield humus      in three to four months. A compost cage will help the      process along and is easy to build.    </p>    <p>      Make the cage of wire screening so the compost can breathe.      You'll be depending on aerobic action. (Anaerobic      composting is not recommended for the small-scale operation      since it takes more equipment for the best results.) For      the same reason, the cage should be no more than five feet      square. Any larger, and the center of the pile won't get      enough air. You can make it as high as you want, but from      the point of view of labor, five feet is about as high as      you'll want to go. You'll also want to make the cage in two      L sections so you can unhook the sides for easy moving.    </p>        <p>      A cage isn't absolutely necessary for composting. But      besides the esthetics of a neat stack of compost as opposed      to a heap, it has two very real advantages. For one thing,      the edges of the pile are kept from blowing away. Sudden      heavy winds can scatter a heap all over the yard. Of      course, it will keep decaying wherever it lands, but that's      not what you're aiming for. A more important contribution      of the cage is that the sides of the pile are kept      perfectly vertical. This prevents rain from leaching away      many of the nutrients. Leaching can be minimized even more      with shredding.    </p>    <p>      Floor your compost cage with half a foot of leaves, plant      waste from your garden, spoiled hay, or garbage (organic,      of course . . . no cans, for instance). Top this with a      couple of inches of manure or used bedding from the barn,      then about an inch of humus from your last compost heap if      you have it, good bacteria-rich topsoil if you haven't.      Unless you need particularly acid compost, for blueberries      or the like, the final layer should be a thin sheet of      ashes, granite dust, finely ground limestone rock or      phosphate rock, to give the heap good mineral balance.      Water the layer down, but don't compress it. Remember, the      center of the pile has to breathe.    </p>    <p>      After you've watered down your first batch of ingredients,      build a second layer onto it, again starting with half a      foot of organic material and progressing from there. Keep      adding layers till you reach the top of your cage. You      should have plenty of organic material around even with      only two or three acres of land. However, if you can't fill      the cage all in one day, you can add to it as you go along.    </p>    <p>      The very top of your bin of compost material should be      slightly concave so that a depression forms to catch      rainwater. Even so, you'll have to check regularly to see      that the pile stays moist. Should it begin to dry out, wet      it down again.    </p>    <p>      A few days after completing your compost pile, you'll      notice it shrinking, or settling. At its center the      temperature is now reaching 150°F, so if you have any      ideas about introducing earthworms to speed things up,      forget it . . . they'd only end up being baked. Compost      piles using only plant material, as opposed to ones to      which manure has been added, can be used in conjunction      with earthworms to make compost, but it's a slower process.    </p>    <p>      After two weeks of brewing, your compost is ready for a      stir. Unhook the two sections of the cage and move it so      that it stands empty next to the pile, which by now is      holding its own shape. With a pitchfork peel off the top      layer of the pile and toss it into the bottom of the cage.      Then strip down the sides of the pile, about half a foot      thick, and toss them in. The center of the pile decays the      most quickly, so by making the outside the inside as you      turn the pile, you get more even decay. Now, layer by      layer, add the rest of the old pile to the new one in the      cage.    </p>    <p>      Turn the pile again the same way after another three weeks,      and a third time two weeks after that. In twelve weeks it's      well-done.    </p>    <h3>SHREDDING METHOD</h3>    <p>      Shredding your compost material speeds up the process of      decay to such a degree that this method is often called      "two-week" or "fourteen-day" composting. And it really      works that quickly.    </p>    <p>      Compost ingredients shredded before stacking decompose more      rapidly for three reasons. First, although the original      amount of material you're working with is the same, its      total surface area is greatly increased. A piece of paper,      for instance, has six sides. Tear it in half and the two      pieces of paper together have twelve sides. Tear the two      again and . . . . . The multiplication of surface areas in      shredding is phenomenal, and the surface area is where the      decay-breeding bacteria live and work. This brings us to      the second advantage of shredding. Small shreds let more      air into a pile through the spaces between the solid      material. More air means more bacteria can sustain      themselves in their job of breaking down the compost. The      third advantage is more moisture penetration, which also      boosts the bacteria population.    </p>    <p>      Shredding compost saves the farmer work. You'll need a      shredder, of course, but it's not the major investment some      other farm equipment is.    </p>    <p>      By shredding the material before composting, with the      subsequent increased bacterial action, you don't have to      carefully build up layers of the various materials in your      compost cage. Just shred the stuff, dump it in, and wet it      down. Add a bit of humus on top of the pile to insure the      introduction of bacteria - like a yeast cake to      dough.    </p>    <p>      By the third day your compost heap should have begun to      heat up. You can use a thermometer to test the inside of      the pile, but why bother? Just stick your hand into it a      ways. Thus you can check to be sure it's moist as well as      warm. If it isn't warm, slide the cage off and turn the      pile over into it, adding more nitrogenous material      throughout. This is rarely necessary if you've added a good      quantity to begin with.    </p>    <p>      Assuming the heap began heating on schedule, on the fourth      day it should be turned. Moisten it down again after      upending it. Be sure not to get it too wet, however. You      don't want excess water to leach out nutrients and drain      them off into the soil. It's not a bad idea to have your      compost cage set on a sheet of plastic or a cement slab as      an additional precaution against leaching.    </p>    <p>      The compost pile should be turned again on the seventh and      on the tenth day. Moisten as necessary to keep it damp      throughout. If all this turning sounds like a lot of work      - it isn't. Shredded material is light and fluffy.      You may not think you're tossing around pillows, but it      won't break your back either.    </p>    <p>      By the fourteenth or fifteenth day your compost will be      ready enough to apply on your garden. It will be rich;      dark, and crumbly. Not as fine as pure humus, which is the      next stage in organic decomposition, but fine to use. If      you want potting-soil quality, let the pile age another one      to three weeks.    </p>    <p>      But, you say, I intend to have a big vegetable garden.      Certainly a pile of leaves and chicken droppings won't      supply me with enough compost fertilizer. Well, let's see.      Suppose you had a five-foot-square compost heap and piled      it five feet high . . . that's a hundred and twenty-five      cubic feet. The finished compost will have a volume of      around ninety cubic feet. That's almost two tons' worth by      weight. If you keep composting, spring, summer, and fall      - say, for six months or so - by the end of      this period you'll have made eight bins of compost. The      total yield in good, high-quality humus will be over      fifteen tons. Fifteen tons of humus a year will fertilize      the soil in a very large vegetable garden and still give      you some left over for the orchard and berry bushes.    </p>    <p>      As an interesting aside on what composting may hold for the      future farm and self-sufficiency, anaerobic manure      digesters have been designed that turn manure into humus.      They operate in an airtight chamber, and as the manure      breaks down, the liberated methane is piped off into a      storage tank. From there it goes to the kitchen stove as      cooking fuel. You can heat the house, generate electricity,      cook your dinner, and still have organic fertilizer for      your fields. There are actually some of these devices in      use in Europe.    </p>    <p>      One English chicken farmer carries the process even further      by having a chicken-manure digester in his car and a      storage tank for the methane produced by the anaerobic      action. He runs his pollution-free engine on the methane.      Detroit would never buy the idea, however. A      1000-chickenpower Cadillac doesn't have the'right sales      appeal.    </p>    <h3>LIME</h3>    <p>      Like most sound agricultural practices, liming the soil was      the custom thousands of years ago, particularly in ancient      China. It did not become a general farming practice in the      United States, however, until the twentieth century. This      was partly due to the fact that the New World's soil was      virgin, and thus not in need of lime. Why bother when      things grew as well here without lime as in the Old Country      with it? But again, it was discovered that soil is not an      endless reservoir, that it must be replenished. Today most      farmers use lime on their fields, particularly in regions      of heavy rainfall where it is easily leached away.    </p>    <p>      The amount of lime needed by the land varies considerably      from region to region. Find a neighbor whose crops you      admire and chat with him. Almost everyone loves to give      advice. You don't have to take it word for word, but it      will give you a good foundation for comparison.    </p>    <p>      The principal functions of lime in the soil are correcting      soil acidity and supplying calcium as a plant nutrient.      Soil that is too acidic does not readily give up its      nutrients to plants . . . lime helps liberate those      nutrients. If other soil conditions are good, the failure      of such lime-loving crops as clover and alfalfa may      indicate the need for liming your land. Of course, it's      preferable to avoid the acidity rather than find out about      it through crop failure. To this end, making a practice of      liming all crops, particularly the legumes -      excepting only the real acid-lovers like berries, radishes,      watermelons, and potatoes - forestalls frustration.    </p>    <p>      <em>The pH Factor.</em> The degrees on a thermometer      indicate temperature. On a warm spring day you can tell      it's in the 70's. . . you're familiar enough with that form      of measurement to guess pretty accurately within what range      the temperature falls. There's no more mystery behind pH.      It's simply a scale, like that for checking temperature,      upon which to measure the acidity/alkalinity of a      substance. In the same way that you can guess the      temperature, a farmer with experience supposedly can taste      and feel and look at a handful of soil to determine      approximately what the pH is and what crops will grow well      in it. As a beginner, you'll need a pH-testing kit.    </p>		    <p>      The pH scale runs from the extreme acid of zero to the      extreme alkaline of 14. Conveniently located in the middle      is 7, which is neutral. The full range of zero to 14      includes much too extreme acid/alkaline conditions for most      plants. Agricultural land usually ranges from a pH of 4 to      one of 8, with most fruits and vegetables doing best in      slightly acid 6.5 to neutral 7 soil, and legumes doing      better in 7 to 7.5 soil.    </p>    <p>      <em>Soil Testing.</em> There's nothing wrong with the old      tried and true method of tasting the soil to see if it's      sweet and alkaline or sour and acidic . . . except that it      doesn't give you an accurate pH reading, and unless you've      eaten a lot of dirt and know what flavor you're after, it's      going to taste, well, like earth.    </p>    <p>      You can still test the soil yourself, however, without      having an educated tongue. Either with a specially prepared      piece of tape, a variant of litmus paper, that when      moistened and pressed into your soil changes color, or with      a more accurate soiltesting kit containing reagents that      will also tell you the nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium      condition of your soil. A third alternative is to send a      sample of your soil to a laboratory. Your county agent or      local agricultural experiment station can either do it for      you or refer you to someone who can. This takes time,      however, and can be costly. You're probably well enough off      with a soil-testing kit unless you seem to have real      problem soil.    </p>    <h3>FORMS OF LIME</h3>    <p>      In order for limestone to dissolve, it must be crushed.      Obviously, you can't put a one-ton block of it in the      center of a field and expect it to dissolve like a sugar      cube. But even thumb-sized pieces aren't small enough to      use unless you're prepared to wait fifty or sixty years.    </p>    <p>      Lime for most soils is best applied in the form of ground      limestone, at the rate of one ton per acre per year. Ground      limestone does not break down immediately. It thus      minimizes the dangers of overliming. The ground limestone      acts very much like the twenty-four-hour cold capsule that      releases its medication slowly over a period of time, only      in the case of lime it's a twelve-month capsule.    </p>    <p>      Lime can be applied in various other forms, including      quicklime and hydrated lime. However, quicklime, as its      name implies, works quickly - often too quickly,      burning your plants. Hydrated lime won't burn your plants,      but it is so water-soluble that one good rain will wash it      deeper into the soil than the plants can reach. Stick with      ground limestone, or equivalents such as ground seashells      or marl.    </p>    <p>      To give the farmer an idea of how quickly the limestone      will activate, it is sold by screening size. That is to      say, it is sifted through various-sized screen sieves, then      graded. The screen size will indicate the size of the      largest particles. Of course, many smaller sizes will also      slip through, even pieces only 1/1000th of an inch in      diameter or smaller. This limestone dust dissolves first,      the larger pieces progressively later, thus maintaining the      proper pH condition of the soil over a long period of time.      Its overall period of effectiveness will be subject to such      variables as types of crops grown and their effect on the      soil.    </p>    <p>      The largest limestone particles passing through a 20-mesh      screen won't begin to affect the soil for over a year and a      half. Those passing through a 100-mesh - the larger      the mesh number, the smaller the particles - will      react almost immediately upon being spread on the. ground.      Since the finer the limestone must be ground the more      expensive it is, you'll want to use the largest possible      particles that will be effective on your land. In most      cases, 20-mesh ground limestone will suit your soil fine.      Remember, the screen size indicates only the largest      particles in the batch. There will be plenty of dustlike      material in it as well.    </p>    <h3>SPREADING THE LIME</h3>    <p>      Limestone is best broadcast on newly plowed land and then      worked in with a disc or a spring-tooth harrow. You will      want to both plow and harrow anyhow, to prepare a good      seedbed, so you only have to remember to lime in between      the two steps. This general rule is not inviolable. Lime      can be spread any time of the year that the field permits.      Some farmers spread it before plowing, simply because that      happens to be a convenient time for them. Others may spread      it on top of winter grains after seeding, for the same      reason. But the best is still the plow-lime-harrow-plant      sequence.    </p>    <p>      How often you lime depends on the crop you plant. In the      case of clover or alfalfa, both lime-lovers, some farmers      lime lightly before each crop. On the whole, however, one      liming a year, a ton of ground limestone per acre, should      suffice. Follow the guidelines suggested by your soil test      results.    </p>    <p>      The beauty of natural farming is that it's pretty hard to      fertilize wrong. It's true that too much animal manure and      lime can decrease your crop yield somewhat. The yield for      one season might fall below expectations, but the      long-range effects aren't destructive. On the other hand,      chemical fertilizers and particularly chemical insecticides      can literally lay the land barren if used excessively, and      when they finally do wash away, not only is the organic      quality of the soil they were used on destroyed, but also      the chemicals continue their destruction all along the      ecological path they follow, through your neighbor's land      and watershed, the streams, the rivers, even in small part      the ocean. Chemical farming helps destroy the world. With      natural farming you'll help build a better one.    </p>
