                    <h5 id="byline">      by TOM RUSSELL    </h5>    <p>      Up here in Wisconsin, other far northern states and Canada,      it's not unusual for four feet of snow to cover the ground      in February.    </p>    <p>      At that time of the year, snowshoes are the only workable      means of cross-country transportation and it's really a      trip to strap on a pair, walk four miles through the woods,      observe lots of wildlife . . . and never see another person      or a road.    </p>    <p>      The only trouble (for me, at least) is that snowshoes cost      about $40 and, last January, I didn't have $10-let      alone $40-for such gear. I decided to make my own      from natural materials and labored through several tries to      construct a fancy bent-wood pair. All such attempts failed,      however, since our area has no ash trees (and ash is the      only wood that really takes and holds the proper curves      when steamed and bent into snowshoe frames).    </p>    <p>      Eventually I gave up trying to build for pretty and decided      I'd just build for stout by making my snowshoes from      whatever creek saplings and string I had on hand, The      finished gear you see in the pictures with this article      cost me only one day's labor. It won't win any beauty      contests, that's for sure, but it does keep me on top of      the snow.    </p>                    <p>      The frames of my down-home footwear are long, fairly      straight sticks that are not too crooked, about as thick as      your thumb at the small, not much bigger on the other end      and four to five feet long (choose the longer lengths for      taller people). Try to take your framing members from spots      in which the saplings are obvious ly growing too thickly      and cut sticks that are springy enough to bend somewhat      without breaking.    </p>    <p>      Cut the three longest saplings to the length of the      shortest, trim all four (Fig. A) so they'll fit together      (Fig. B) and bind the sticks (Fig. C).    </p>    <p>      Next cut four 1" x 2" spreader bars eight to ten inches      long and insert them between the long saplings as shown in      Fig. D. Then string up the frames so they hold together and      look as pretty as you can make 'em (Photo 1). As an      experiment, I strung one of mine with nylon seine twine and      the other with heavy cotton string. So far both have held      up well, even on trips over crusty snow.    </p>    <p>      Make a rope bridle large enough to accommodate a boot toe      across each snowshoe. The binding should be placed ahead of      the shoe's center of balance so that the toe of the      contrivance is picked up as you raise and move your foot      forward. Fasten the snowshoe to your foot with a loop of      rope long enough to go around your ankle and hook (with a      bent nail or whatever) back into the bridle as shown in      Photo 2. It's a good idea to add some nylon, rope, rawhide      or fabric reinforcement to each snowshoe where your boot      rests.    </p>    <p>      That's it! You're ready to go. Just don't forget to pack      along a geodetic survey map and compass on those long      overland treks. The north woods look altogether different      when they're waist-deep in snow . . . and a good      outdoorsman always figures on finding his way back home      again before he even leaves the cabin.    </p>

The extra twigs on either side of the boot were added to strenghten the main frame.

Note how the webbing is interwoven to reduce slipping from side to side where the cords cross. It is important to keep string taut while weaving so that the tension is evenly distributed throughout the shoe.
