                        <p>      Mother has been compared so many times to the early farm      publications, that we've gone back to some 1882 AMERICAN      AGRICULTURISTs, 1892 FARM AND HOMEs and 1906 FARM AND      FIRESIDEs to make a few comparisons. Yes, sure enough.      Those old periodicals were mainly crammed full of      how-to-articles and letters from their readers just like      MOTHER... with all the ads stuck off in the back just like      MOTHER. Matter of fact, we felt so much at home rummaging      around in those "outdated" farm papers that we decided to      bring you the best of what we found. Here then, are four      pages of mostly good ideas... a few "just for fun" tips...      and some great old ads from the past.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Suggestions for the Season.<br /></strong>    </p>        <p>     <strong>The Close of the Year.</strong> <strong><br />      </strong>    </p>    <p>      December is the first month of winter and the last of the      year. It is a most fitting time for taking an "account of      stock." Storekeepers and businessmen know the importance of      this work. The goods are overhauled and an exact list of      all the articles, with their value, is made out; and from      this, with the expenditures, the balance for the year is      obtained. The farmer should do the same thing with his farm      property, that he may also know how much he has made or      lost during the year. The task is not a great one, as the      sheep, horses, implements, grain, etc., can be catalogued      rapidly, and when it is done there is a feeling of      satisfaction that more than pays for the trouble. It may be      somewhat difficult to estimate accurately some of the      items, as for example the amount of labor expended upon a      crop still upon the ground. A system of farm accounts kept      from week to week will aid greatly in all such cases.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Filter for Cistern.</strong><br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>BY GRUNDY, CHRISTIAN CO., ILL.</strong>    </p>        <p>      While visiting a friend last year, I was surprised to find      that he was compelled to use cistern water for alt      purposes. In answer to my inquiries, he stated that no well      water was to be had in that section short of one hundred      feet, and then the quality was such that no one could use      it. Springs were unknown. Three miles distant was a creek      to which all live stock was driven, when cisterns and ponds      failed. The water in the house cistern was simply      abominable, caused by keeping the spout turned on, and      running in every drop that felt on the house. At his      earnest solicitation, I constructed a filter for his      cistern, of which I give a sketch. He recently informed me      that it works like a charm and that his neighbors are all      using it. Figure 1 allows the filter. It is a large barrel      with one end knocked out. At the bottom is a layer of fine      charcoal, <em>d</em> . Above this is a layer of fine      gravel, <em>c</em> ; over this is a layer of coarse gravel,      <em>b</em> on the top of the barrel is a thin strainer, a,      held in place by a hoop which fits over the barrel. The      cloth is depressed in the center as seen In the cut. This      strainer catches all leaves and coarse dirt, and should be      cleaned after every shower. Some use a wire strainer of      very- fine mesh, but the cloth answers the purpose very      well. The filtered water flows through a hole, <em>e</em> .      Into this hole a metal tube a foot or more long, punched      full of holes, and covered with wire netting, is inserted.      Six inches below the top is another hole, s; which is      fitted with a short pipe as seen is figure 2.    </p>        <p>      During a heavy shower the overflow runs out of this hole,      and into a spout provided for it. Figure 2 shows the      general arrangement of the entire apparatus. The barrel has      a small shed built ever it, to protect it from the sun and      weather. This shed should open at one end, so the barrel      can be taken out at any time. The top is movable to allow      the strainer to be cleaned. The lower section of the      water-spout should be loose, so that it may be moved up or      down, end turned. In figure 2 the elbow rests on a block,      or bracket, and the water flows through a hole in the cover      of the shed, into the barrel. When the cistern is full, the      elbow is turned, and drops down to a block, and throws the      water into the spout to be carried away, or into a " wash      water" cistern nearby. The above arrangement may be      modified to suit different circumstances and places. When      rain water is used exclusively for cooking and drinking, it      is best to have a cistern for it alone, and a separate one      for wash water. At the beginning of a storm, it is well to      lot the rain wash the roof for an hour or two, before the      stream is allowed to enter the cistern. This is especially      necessary where pigeons and outer birds collect upon the      roots, as well us to wash off accumulated dust.    </p>        <p>      <strong>WINTER RATIONS FOR POULTRY.</strong>    </p>    <p>      As staple food, nothing is better and nothing is so cheap      as good Indian corn, and one meal a day may safely be of      this grain, either ground or whole. Grinding is of less      consequence for poultry than for the larger animals, as      every bird carries a complete mill for this purpose, and      puts in a new run of stones as often as it can get to the      ground. A variety of grain is always acceptable; wheat      screenings, buckwheat, oats, and rye, the last rather      sparingly. Cooked food is highly relished-potatoes or      turnips, boiled and mashed with Indian meal, scalded and      fed warm, especially on frosty mornings. Fowls are very      fond of vegetables, eaten raw, and if-sugar-beets or      mangels or turnips are put within reach, they will help      themselves. For an appetizer, nothing is better than      cabbage or the tops o£ turnips. Hens never tire of      cabbage, and a good supply for winter should always be laid      in. Animal food in some shape must be furnished, if you      want plenty of eggs, Shore farmers can get fish offal from      the markets, clams from the banks, or minnows from the      ditches. Skimmed milk is always in order, and meat scraps      front fat trying establishments, sold in large cakes, and      placed where the hens have free access to them, are a cheap      and excellent food for laying poultry.    </p>    		    <p>     <strong>Secure the Ice Crop.</strong>    </p>    <p>      When there is good solid ice six inches thick the work of      filling the ice house should not be delayed. There are so      many risks to run in waiting for thicker ice, that it is      much better to gather the crop at the very first      opportunity. If snow comes while the ice to being formed,      it should be removed while it is fresh; this may be done      with a snow-push or a short and a heavy stable broom; and      on a large scale with a snow plow and scraper. Icemen who      harvest many thousand tons, have a complete outfit of      labor-saving tools for their work. The farmer, with only a      small house, holding 25 to 30 tons, needs a common      cross-cut saw with one han dle removed. A splitting bar may      be made of a largo chisel with along handle. A pike for      handling the ice cakes while they are in the water, is very      convenient, and can be made by any blacksmith at a trilling      expense. Ice-tongs are not essential; but are so handy and      cheap, that it usually pays to be provided with them. The      ice to be cut is first lined by using a hatchet or axe      along a straight-edge board; after sawing, the strips are      cut into squares by first making a deep groove, and      afterwards using the splitting chisel. Ice is heavy and      difficult to handle, and advantage should be taken of the      ease with which it slides aver smooth surfaces. Loading the      sled or wagon from the pond or river, is usually the      hardest labor of the ice harvest. This can be made      comparatively easy in many places, by drawing the ice      blocks up an inclined shute made of planks with narrow      edges of boards. A number of blocks of lee doing placed in      a line at the submerged end of the shute, a spike is forced      into the rear one, and with the team attached to the spike,      the whole row is slid up into the box of the sled or      wagon.    </p>        <p>      <strong>LOADING ICE EASILY.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Mr. "C. G. T.," Dutchess Co., N. Y., sends us a sketch of a      method of loading ice, here illustrated, and writes :      Whenever ice must be hauled on sleds, the following method      of loading will save a great deal of heavy lifting. A pole      of sufficient length to reach the bottom of the pond is      firmly set through a hole cut in the ice. At a suitable      hight, a chain with a loop at the end is fastened; through      this loop another pole is passed, which acts as a lever. At      one end of this lever the ice-tongs are attached with a      rope or chain. A canal is cut, the ice blocks floated up to      it, when they may be hoisted from the water directly into      the sled.    </p>    <h3>      Winter Care of Livestock    </h3>    <p>      There are a few general rules for the care of live stock in      winter, which are of universal application:    </p>    <p>      <em>First.</em> -They should lie dry, whether bedded      or not, A dry floor is far better than wet bedding. Spar or      slat floors, through which urine will quickly pass, and      which give the animals a lever standing place, are      especially to be advised. A good degree of comfort may be      had oil such floors, but a full supply of dry      litter-straw, leaves, swamp bay, etc.-certainly      makes all kinds of stock more comfortable.    </p>    <p>      <em>Second.</em> -Shelter saves fodder, wherever      lumber can be easily obtained, to a degree which few      practical men are aware of. The warmer the stables are, the      better, except perhaps for sheep. But with close, warm      stables, it is essential that the manure heap should be      where it will not contaminate the air, and that there      should be perfect ventilation so arranged as not to cause      drafts of air.    </p>    <p>      <em>Third.</em> -As to feed. This should be given      with the utmost regularity and uniformity-never more      than will be all eaten up long before the next feeding      time. Then the animals have an appetite for their food, so      that coarse fodder may be first given, to be followed with      better, and by grain in some form, if this be a part of the      daily ration. This is no doubt the most economical system,      securing the least waste and best digestion of all kinds of      fodder used in the ordinary way.    </p>    <p>      <em>Fourth.</em> -Grooming and care of the animals      are a most valuable means of keeping them in health as well      as of saving feed. The skin of an animal existing in a      state of nature is washed by every shower, brushed and      carded by every bush, licked by its mates, rubbed by the      ground in rolling, and in various ways kept free from      accumulations of its own exfoliations, from the stoppage of      its pores by sweat, and from its own inherent dirt. A      healthy skin means warmth, health, life, and vigor, other      things being about right, and we can secure this in horses      and cattle only by grooming. A straw brush, made by      twisting up a thick rope of straw until it becomes very      hard and is inclined to kink, than doubling it and twisting      it into a stiff mass a foot to 18 inches long perhaps, with      the ends tucked and fastened, will do a deal of rubbing      before it goes to pieces, and is for purposes of friction,      rubbing off mud, etc., better than any other brush. Clean      skills are just as important for cows as for horses, and      the use of the brush is recommended in the cattle stalls.    </p>        <p>      <em>Fifth</em> . -Sunshine. Fresh air and sunshine      are health-giving and invigorating principles and not one      of our living dependents should be without them. In the      thorough ventilation recommended, good air has been      provided for, nevertheless all well fed animals enjoy and      air the better for air breathed out of doors even on our      coldest days and a sun-bath of an hour or two is of the      highest value. Stables should be constructed with reference      to sunlight, and long narrow wings for stables, both for      horses and cattle, have in this particular a great      advantage over basement stables under the whole barn, as      the former may have windows for the admission of sunlight      and air throughout their entire length.<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Sixth</em> -Give all animals free access to salt.      With plenty of feed, horses and sheep will stand any degree      of dry cold incident to the climate of the United States      and Canada. Neat cattle need more protection, and it is      really cruel to expose them unprotected to winter weather.      Swine need thoroughly warm dry quarters to winter and will      hardly survive exposure such as other domestic animals will      bear perfectly well. So with poultry-while turkeys      will bear the severest storms and cold roosting in the most      exposed positions, fowls seek shelter either of thick      evergreens or houses and ducks and geese the protection of      the manure pile or the hay stack. In sheltering all animals      and poultry, which we do from motives of economy, it is      well to bear in mind their natural instincts, that those      which need it most are best protected.    </p>        <p>     <strong>When to Apply Manure.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The common practice is to cart the manure from the barnyard      once a year; usually fit the spring. In this way the      hauling is done, when other work is pressing, and while the      ground is soft. It is better to draw out the manure exposed      in open yards, as it accumulates, and drop it in heaps in      the fields where it is to be used. With the best facilities      for keeping the manure-that is , with a      barn-cellar-there is less loss in keeping it under      cover, and when well rotted, apply it to the ground just at      the tuna time when it will be of the most benefit to the      crop. Manure is considered as so much capital used in      growing the crop, and bears interest only as it is used by      the plants. If beets or turnips need the most manure in      midsummer, it is economy to apply it then, provided there      is the proper facility for making, storing, and turning out      this valuable fertilizer every month in the year. Grass      lands can make use of manure at dearly all times, and upon      these it may be spread in winter with economy of labor and      excellent results.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Getting Ready for Spring</strong>    </p>    <p>      A light and warm work-shop is a good investment. Men and      boys cannot be expected to do much work if their fingers      are numbed with cold, but if a suitable place and proper      facilities are provided, the stormy days of winter may be      turned to good account. Among the needed preparations for      spring is putting the implements in good order. Not merely      the mowers and other costly implements, but even the hoe      and spade will do better work it, property ground. All iron      and steel tools and parts of machines call be readily      preserved from rust by the use of a mixture of lard and      rosin, melted together (an ounce of rosin to a pound of      lard), and stirred while cooling. This may be applied by      means of a rag, or better, a swab, made by winding a bit of      cloth around the end of a stick. Only a light coating is      needed, and this is more readily applied if the article be      warm. If the wood-work of machines was originally painted,      it is well to repaint when necessary, but if it was merely      oiled, use linseed oil again. For wood that has not been      painted or oiled crude petroleum, (several applications to      saturate the wood,) is an excellent preservative. Where      there are massy small tools, such as the trowels, hand      forks, etc., it is well to paint a portion of the handles      bright red. Such affairs are quite apt to be left where      last used, or dropped in going from place to place. The red      makes them very conspicuous, and will often save much      hunting. Besides repairing, various garden conveniences may      be made. Markers of various widths are useful, though it is      quite as convenient to have a marker so arranged that it      will serve for several distances. The head of the marker      should be a piece of scantling, and the teeth of hard wood.      Placing one row of teeth nine inches apart, and the teeth      of the other row a foot apart, will allow, by the use of      every mark, or every other one, rows at four different      distances to be made-9, 12, and 24 inches. A good      wooden reel for the garden line is much more useful than      the poorly made iron ones so often sold. It is well to have      ready the boxes for raising plants from seeds, either in      the house or in the hot-bed . Those for the window may be a      foot wide, three inches deep, and of a length corresponding      to the width of the window frame. Those for use in the      hot-beds are most cheaply made from the boxes in which      starch, soap, and other articles are purchased. These can      be bought when empty at a low price and by cutting them in      halves two may be made from each, the cover forming the      bottom of one of them. Boxes without either top or bottom      with mosquito netting tacked on in place of the cover are      of great service in keeping insects from melon or other      vines.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE COW OF THE FUTURE AND HER OUTFIT.</strong>    </p>        <p>       <strong>A Subscription Fraud-Look out for Him</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of our subscribers at St. Thomas, Canada, writes us      that a good looking man (they are always good looking and      well dressed) with a wooden leg, is taking subscriptions      for various newspapers and giving receipts for the same,      signing the name of the firm or party publishing the paper.      He is the worst kind of a swindler, besides being a forger,      as this parties whose receipts were used by him say that      the signature is a forgery and that they employ no      wooden-legged men or thieves in their business. Another      Correspondent    </p>    <p>      writes us that he sent in response to a glowing New York      City advertisement, $5 to pay for some of the goods      advertised therein. He never. received the goods, and      wished us to look the parties up and, get his money for      him. He sent us an order on them for the amount, but he      might as well have sent us a Deed for "Lots in the Moon,"      as we should have about as good a prospect of finding them,      as of finding the firm he would have us look for.      Moral-Avoid all the flashy advertisements you see, as      they are only a net spread to catch the unwary.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Still Another</strong>    </p>    <p>      complaint comes from Glens Falls in the State, and encloses      an advertisement of a would-be Gent's Furnishing House      situated (or supposed to be) in the immediate neighborhood      of this office. We would say to our friend that it is only      an old swindle under a new name. There is no such store as      the company advertise, and any one who sends to this man,      whose name begins with R and is spelled with four      syllables, $9 for six shirts and expects to receive them,      will die of old age before they arrive.    </p>        <p>     <strong>Corn Oysters</strong>    </p>    <p>      To six good-sized ears of corn add three well-beaten eggs,      one tablespoonful of cream and one of flour; salt and      pepper to taste, fry in butter and serve hot.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Posts Lifted by Frost</strong>    </p>        <p class="caption">      Fig. 1 - POST LIFTED BY FROST.    </p>    <p>      The curious expansion of water freezing, and of soils      filled with water, has a telling effect upon fence posts      standing in damp ground. The top soil around a fence post,      if dry, or only slightly moist, does not affect the post      during winter. But if the particles of soil are saturated      with water, on freezing the whole expands an eighth; so      that, when frozen eight inches deep, the post is lifted an      inch out of the lower unfrozen soil. If the frost      penetrates sixteen inches, the post rises two inches. When      the frost leaves, and the surface soil sinks back, the post      remains two inches out of the ground. A few freezings of      the surface will thus inevitably throw the post out so far      as to render it useless, unless it is driven down every      spring before the open space left at its bottom is filled      by soil washed in. For this reason it is advisable to make      the extreme lower ends of fence and other posts a little      tapering, or at least to clip off the bottom corners so      that they can be driven down more easily when lifted. We      will say now in advance, that all fence and other posts      should be examined early every spring, and those at all      lifted be driven back with a beetle or sledge hammer. A      stitch in time will save nine, here. On naturally dry, or      drained land, the above trouble will not be experienced,      except at places where water flows through them from a      higher to a lower level, thus keeping them wet, or very      damp.    </p>    <p>       <strong>Destroying Stone Fence Walls.</strong>    </p>        <p>      When these stand on water-saturated soil, the expansion by      cold, if uniform on both sides, does not affect them. But      almost invariably, epecially if running in any direction      but north and south, and often then the soil under them      will be more frozen or sooner thawed on one side than on      the other, and thus they will be thrown out of      perpendicular, and more or less disturbed. Only four inches      of frozen wet ground under one side of a stone wall, and      none under the other, will lift the frozen side half an      inch, or enough to tilt five inches to one side the top of      a wall five feet high and two feet thick at the      bottom-enough to greatly disturb it, and ultimately      throw it down. A wall set down two or three feet deep in      the ground will be similarly affected, if water stands      around its base. There are two remedies. One is to run a      drain under or near the wall, deep enough to carry off all      standing water about it, below the freezing point. The      other is, to raise the earth into a ridge before the wall      is built, high enough to have it always dry. This is      readily done by successive plowings, turning the furrows to      the center of where the wall is to stand. The saving of      foundation stone will far more than cover the cost of      raising the ridge; and the fence will not need to be so      high if standing on such a ridge, as animals will not jump      it so well when they must spring from ground rising in      front of them.    </p>    <p>       <strong>Leaves and Dry Dirt </strong>    </p>    <p>      Lay in a supply of leaves and dry dirt before the cold      season opens and the ground is frozen. The fowls will have      to remain during a large portion of their time in the      poultry-house in the winter, and will require materials      for, the dust bath. For, this purpose there is nothing      superior to coal-ashes, but they must be sifted twice,      first to remove this coarse materials, and next through a      fine sieve, in order that only the finer portions may be      used. A dust bath should be composed of dust (not coarse      dirt), in order that the hens may throw it well into their      feathers. Dry dirt is always plentiful, and should be      placed under shelter, especially if, there is air      insufficient supply of ashes. Wood-ashes should not be used      for the dust bath, as they contain potash and irritate the      skin. Leaves are the best of all materials for the floor,      as they not only induce the hens to scratch, but to a      certain extent prevent draughts of air on, the floor.    </p>        <p>     <strong>A Frost Proof Cellar.</strong>    </p>        <p>      A good cellar for storing roofs, etc,, that is frost proof      in winter, and cool in summer, maybe constructed as      follows: The ground should be excavated for four feet, and      walls of stone built, with an arching of brick to cover the      whole. An air space is left between the bricks and the      earth above them. This is made by laying scantling      lengthwise of the roof, and covering them with boards or      plank well battened. This secures a non-conducting air      space, which prevents the passage of moisture from the      outside. A ventilator in each gable end of the cellar,      provides for a circulation of air, and the escape of any      moisture that might otherwise collect on the surface of the      boards. There should be a sash or trap door in the      ventilator shaft, that may be opened or closed by means of      a cord and weight, which hang down in the cellar. In hot,      summer weather it may be necessary to provide some shade      over the ventilators. A cross section of such a cellar is      shown in the engraving.    </p>    <p>       <strong>Controlling Broody Hens</strong>    </p>    <p>      If it is desirable to prevent broody hens from incubating      at this season, it can be done with but little difficulty.      Simply provide a coop, raised a few inches from the floor,      the coop to have a bottom made of slats, so as to allow of      free circulation of air under the hen. A broody hen's      efforts are directed to warming her eggs. She does not      relish cold draughts underneath her body, and soon leaves      the coop in disgust. This method is humane and efficacious.      In other words the hen must feel the accumulating warmth of      the nest or, coop in order to remain at her work.    </p>        <p>       <strong>TO GET RID OF RATS.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Everybody has a method of getting rid of rats, and all are      good at times. To the farmer and poultry keeper these      rodents are a terrible nuisance and means of loss. They      will capture a half-grown chicken before your eyes and      escape with him be fore you can do anything. It is very      hard to trap them because they won't go near the traps      after one or two have been caught. Many do not know that      spread ing a square yard of thin cloth over the trap will      deceive them. Place the bait on the pan of the trap, but on      top of the cloth. It rats cannot be driven out of the      building, poison in some form will kill many. Rough on Rats      is sure death,but is dange ous and must be kept away, from      poultry and all other stock. Precipitated carbonate of      baryta, which is a poisonous, heavy, white powder, devoid      of taste and smell, has been tried and proved very      effective. Mix with four times its weight of barley meal,      make a stiff paste with water, and introduce small pellets      of it into the rat holes. The smallest quantity proves      fatal, and it seems to immediately paralyze the hind      quarters, so the rat will not get away and the where he      could be eaten by domestic animals and prove fatal to them.      It has been proved that neither pigeons nor fowls will      touch the paste. Rats may be also killed by feeding them      regularly in one place and then a few days substitute dry      plaster of parts and a little meal for the regular food.      Have a pail of water where they can drink and the plaster      of parts will harden inside and kill them. Whether or not a      method is cruel is hardly to be considered inthis      connection, and we give this for what it is worth: Catch      several rate without injuring them and put them in a tight      cage. Do not feed them anything and they will eat each      other, until all but one are eaten, and he may then be let      loose. He has now such a love for a cannibal diet that he      will soon eat every rat on the place. Rats may also be      scared away by catching one or two, covering them with tar      and feathers, and letting them go, or by putting a leather      collar and small bell on the neck, or painting them with      phosphorus. They will run after the others, and all leave      the building for good. Cover the floor near their holes      with caustic potassa; they will get sore feet, and licking      their feet will get sore mouths. A spry cat or dog will      generally see that these rodents keep out of the way.    </p>        <p>     <strong>TO PREPARE AN ASPARAGUS BED.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The preparation of an asparagus bed should be made with      more care than for most vegetables as it is to be a      permanent crop. The ground should be thoroughly drained,      naturally or artificially, and preferably of a rather light      sandy loam. This should be trenched and a heavy coat of      well-rotted manure applied. Either one or two-year-old      plants are set, which may be raised from seed or bought of      nurserymen. Set in rows not less than 4 ft apart, 6 is      better, and 3 ft in the row. Set the roots from 4 to 6 in      below the surface so as to cultivate over the crowns. The      beds will last longer and stand drouth better when set      deep. The plane may be set in either spring or fall. If in      the spring, as soon as the ground is dry enough to work;      and if in the fall as soon as plants can be obtained, which      is usually early in October. Fall setting where posssible      is preferable for the roots have the chance to form and      start earlier the next spring.    </p>        <p>      <strong>To Winter Celery Successfully</strong> out of doors      it should be banked to the very tips, the earth being kept      away from the upper part of the celery by boards. Over the      top a trough or boards may be nailed to keep off the rain.      This roof should be heavily covered with coarse strawy      manure. This will keep it safely until Christmas and during      the severe weather later; if litter be placed above this it      will probably keep till spring. Frequent inspection will      dictate whether still greater protection will be required.      With a very large quantity of celery for market, a trench 1      ft wide and 18 in to 2 ft deep may be dug. Tile may be      placed in the bottom and the celery packed closely together      in the trench. It should then be walled up as previously      described and covered with an inverted trough of hoards.    </p>    <p>      A celery house is in use in many places. It is little more      than a roof on the ground, the object being to have the      roofers near the top of the celery as possible. The celery      is packed in rows; with paths between through which the      attendant may occasionally crawl to inspect it. The      greatest danger will be from keeping it too warm and      inducing rotting. There will be no danger of too much      ventilation in the mildest weather. Whatever the roof is      composted of it should be tight, as water dripping through      upon the crop will surely rot it. It is not necessary to      put up the celery until late in the season. [Hollister      Sage, Fairfield CO., Ct.]    </p>        <p>      <strong>How to Peel</strong><strong>Tomatoes.</strong>      Nearly all cook books say, "pour boiling water over ripe      tomatoes and then skin them," and at least 99 In every 100      persons attempt to peel theta in this manner, and      consequently do it with much difficulty and very      imperfectly. This is the proper way to peel tomatoes: Cover      them with boiling water half a minute, then lay them in      cold water till these are perfectly cold, when the skin can      be slipped off without difficulty leaving the tomatoes      unbroken and as firm as before they were scolded.    </p>
