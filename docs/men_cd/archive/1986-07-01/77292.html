            <p>      <strong>From Mother No. 75</strong>    </p>            <p>      Perk up your palate with these light (yet satisfying!)      single-dish meals.    </p>        <p>      Right now, most garden plots are fairly bursting with      mouthwatering vegetables . . . and a lot of that produce      will find its way to the dinner table in large, colorful      salads. But straight-fromthe-garden edibles aren't the only      "raw materials" that can be used to make memorable salads.      You can also create tasty cold dishes from cooked grains,      pasta, beans, or marinated cooked vegetables.    </p>    <p>      The nourishing-and filling-"alternative" salads      featured here should be prepared well in advance and      refrigerated until serving time to allow their flavors to      blend and mature. Each dish is based on nutritious, natural      foods and-when served with homemade bread-makes      an appealing, lightweight supper on those steamy summer      days when no one feels much like cooking a hot meal-      <em>or</em> like eating one.			</p>      <h3>Tabouli    </h3>    <p>      Among chilled grain salads, <em>tabouli</em> -which      you'll also see spelled a number of other ways-is      probably the most "exotic." This spicy dish isn't a staple      of most Westerners' diets, but it is a great Lebanese      favorite . . . and the traditional formula can easily be      varied to suit individual tastes.    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup of raw bulgur wheat<br />      3 medium-sized tomatoes, chopped<br />      1 cup of minced fresh parsley<br />      1/3 cup of diced scallions<br />      1/2 cup of lemon juice<br />      1/2 cup of sesame or olive oil<br />      2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh (or 2 teaspoons of      dried) mint<br />      1 teaspoon of sea salt<br />      Pinch of cayenne pepper    </p>    <p>      Combine all the ingredients and marinate them in the      refrigerator for about 6 hours. Then adjust the seasonings      to taste, and serve the tabouli on a thick bed of lettuce      leaves or sprouts. (As an alternative, you could chop up      the greens and toss them in with the salad . . . pile the      whole mixture on a platter . . . garnish it with black      olives and sprigs of parsley . . . and let four hungry      people scoop it up-Middle Eastern style-with      whole lettuce leaves.)    </p>    <h3>      Balkan Rice Salad    </h3>    <p>      2 medium-sized zucchini squash, cubed and steamed<br />      1 cup of thinly sliced onion<br />      1/2 cup of chopped pimientos<br />      1 large clove of garlic, pressed<br />      1/3 cup of sesame or olive oil<br />      3 tablespoons of vinegar<br />      2 tablespoons of soy sauce    </p>    <p>      Marinate the foregoing ingredients and chill them for at      least 4 hours. Meanwhile, you can prepare the rest of the      salad, as follows.    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons of butter<br />      1 small onion, minced<br />      1 cup of raw brown rice or millet<br />      2 cups of water (3 cups if using millet)<br />      3 tablespoons of soy sauce<br />      1 tablespoon of catsup<br />      1 teaspoon of curry powder    </p>    <p>      Saut√© the onion in the butter before adding the      grain, water, and seasonings. Next, cover the pan and let      it simmer for about 45 minutes . . . after which you can      stir in the marinated mixture and these garnishes:    </p>    <p>      1 large green pepper, chopped<br />      1/2 cup of sliced green olives<br />      1/2 cup of sliced black olives<br />      2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley    </p>    <p>      Season the rice salad to taste and chill it thoroughly.      This hearty cold dish will easily feed six people when it's      arranged on a bed of greens and surrounded with sprouts and      lemon wedges. You can even stuff the leftovers into pita      bread pockets for the following day's lunch!    </p>    <h3>      Cucumber-Yogurt Salad    </h3>    <p>      3 cucumbers<br />      1/2 cup of plain yogurt<br />      3 tablespoons of mayonnaise<br />      1 tablespoon of fresh (or 1-1/2 teaspoons of dried)      dillweed<br />      1/2 teaspoon of celery seed<br />      1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder<br />      1/4 teaspoon of sea salt<br />      Pinch of cayenne pepper<br />      Sesame seeds    </p>    <p>      Slice the cucumbers very thin . . . combine them with the      rest of the ingredients . . . and let the salad marinate in      the refrigerator until it's well chilled. Sprinkle it with      toasted sesame seeds just before serving. This tangy,      refreshing dish will perk up a dinner for four.    </p>    <h3>      Cold Broccoli Salad    </h3>    <p>      1 bunch of fresh broccoli, cut in chunks (about 4 cups) and      steamed<br />      2 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />      2 heaping tablespoons of minced scallions<br />      1 cup of sliced mushrooms<br />      1 clove of garlic, pressed<br />      1 teaspoon of soy sauce<br />      1/2 cup of dry white wine<br />      3/4 cup of soy mayo, yogurt, or sour cream    </p>    <p>      Drizzle the lemon juice over the steamed broccoli and set      it aside to cool. Then, in a saucepan over medium heat,      simmer the rest of the vegetables in the wine and soy sauce      for a few minutes. Add the broccoli before stirring in the      mayonnaise ... refrigerate the dish for about 2 hours . . .      and serve it to four to six broccoli lovers. (This salad      will be especially attractive if you decorate it with      cherry tomatoes and avocado cubes.)    </p>    <h3>      Marinated Bean and Vegetable Salad    </h3>    <p>      2 cups of cooked green beans<br />      2 cups of cooked pinto or kidney beans 11/2 cups of cooked      chickpeas (garbanzo beans)<br />      8 ounces of canned artichoke hearts, quartered      (optional)<br />      1 cup of fresh green peas, either raw or very lightly      steamed<br />      1 cup of diced carrots, lightly steamed<br />      1/2 cup of sliced ripe olives<br />      1/3 cup of chopped scallions<br />      1/3 cup of diced green pepper<br />      1/2 cup of chopped pimientos<br />      1/4 cup of minced fresh parsley<br />      1 tablespoon of chopped fresh (or 1-1/2 teaspoons of dried)      chives    </p>    <p>      Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl, then add the      following dressing:    </p>    <p>      1 cup of sesame or olive oil<br />      1/2 cup of cider vinegar<br />      2 tablespoons of honey<br />      1 or 2 cloves of garlic, pressed<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons of herb seasoning salt<br />      1 teaspoon of basil<br />      Pinch of cayenne pepper    </p>    <p>      Cover the bowl and let the mixture      marinate-chilled-for at least 6 hours, stirring      it occasionally. This recipe makes a lot of piquant,      filling salad . . . so feel free to gather six or eight      friends to help you eat it!    </p>    <h3>      Chilled Pasta Salad    </h3>    <p>      1-1/2 cups of cooked and drained macaroni or noodles<br />      1 stalk of celery, sliced<br />      1 small carrot, grated<br />      2 tablespoons of minced parsley<br />      1 tablespoon of chopped scallions<br />      1/4 cup of diced green pepper (optional)<br />      1/4 cup of alfalfa sprouts (optional)    </p>    <p>      Mix the pasta and vegetables together, and toss them with      your favorite cream dressing . . . or make a distinctive      sauce from the following ingredients:    </p>    <p>      1 cup of instant (or 2/3 cup of noninstant) milk      powder<br />      1/2 cup of plain yogurt<br />      2 teaspoons of cider vinegar<br />      1/2 teaspoon of soy sauce<br />      1 teaspoon of basil<br />      1/2 teaspoon of thyme<br />      1/4 teaspoon of oregano<br />      1/2 teaspoon of sea salt<br />      Pinch of cayenne pepper    </p>    <p>      Chill the salad until you're ready to eat it (at least 2      hours), then serve it, on lettuce leaf beds, to four or      five diners.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, a summer supper doesn't have to be heavy      and hot . . . nor must it necessarily be a simple bowl of      fresh vegetables and greens. Once you've tried one (or      more) of these nutritious one-dish meals, we think you'll      agree that "alternative" salads are the "hottest" coolers      going in warm-weather cookery!    </p>
