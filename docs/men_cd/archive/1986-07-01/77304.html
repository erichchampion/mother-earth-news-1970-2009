            <p><strong>      From Mother No. 84</strong>    </p>    		<p>      Do you drink enough?</p>    <h5 id="byline">By Philip Collins, D.H.Sc., M.P.H.    </h5>        <p>      A number of years ago, the Swiss put together a fine      mountain-climbing team, hopping it would be the first to      scale Mount Everest. Many months went into the group's      preparation because of the tremendous demands that would be      made upon human energy in the effort to reach the top of      the world. Unfortunately, despite all that careful      planning, the Swiss team had to abandon the attempt because      of sheer exhaustion, not realizing that a source of relief      was covering the ground all around them.    </p>    <p>      A year or so later, when a group of British climbers      undertook the same challenge, their team physician, Sir      John Hunt, remembered that the Swiss had consumed only two      cups of water per day during their assault on the mountain.      Dr. Hunt recommended that the U.K. team carry additional      snow-melting equipment, since he believed that the climbers      would function better if they drank more water. He felt      that when working in the thin, chill air, people lose a lot      of water not only through perspiration, but also through      respiration, because the air entering the lungs has to be      humidified as it's brought nearer to body temperature.      Therefore, the doctor in sisted that each Brit ish      participant drink a mini mum of 12 cups of water daily.      That team, headed by Sir Edmund Hillary, followed his      advice and became the first expedition to plant its flag on      the summit of the world's highest peak.    </p>    <h3>      Little-Known Scientific Facts    </h3>    <p>      In order to further examine Dr. Hunt's theory about how      water consumption affected endurance, a Harvard      physiologist, G.C. Pitts, tested groups of male ath letes      by putting them on treadmills timed at 3-1/2 miles per      hour.    </p>    <p>      The subjects in the first group were given no water at all      and were asked to walk until they were so fatigued that      they could go no farther. These athletes lasted about 3-1/2      hours. Their temperatures rose rapidly during the test      period and, in the exhaustion phase, finally reached an      average of above 102Â° F.    </p>    <p>      The members of the second group were allowed to drink as      much as they desired, and their temperatures didn't rise      nearly as rapidly. However, after approximately six hours      of exercise on the treadmill, as the men reached      exhaustion, their body heat zoomed up.    </p>    <p>      Finally, Dr. Pitts chose a third group and carefully      calibrated their water losses, replacing the exact amount      of water lost (about one cup every 15 minutes) while the      men were exercising. As a result, though they stayed on the      treadmill seven hours, the test subjects did <em>not</em>      experience a drastic rise in temperature nor did they reach      exhaustion. In fact, when asked how they felt, they replied      that they could go as long as the doctor wanted them to!    </p>    <h3>      "But I Don't Feel Thirsty!"    </h3>    <p>      Several conclusions can be reached from these experiments.      The first is that thirst isn't necessarily a good indicator      of the body's need for water. You must, in general, drink      more liquid than your thirst seems to call for. Second,      there's a close relationship between water consumption and      fatigue. Third, water appears to have a significant effect      upon the regulation of body temperature. And fourth, a more      active person is in greater need of water because of the      dehydrating effects of perspiration and rapid breathing.    </p>    <p>      You may wonder how to tell when you're not getting enough      water. Well, there are a number of clinical signs to watch      for. In America, for example, many adults and children are      afflicted with constipation. (It's estimated that the      laxative business takes in some $200 million each year.)      This bowel dysfunction is often one of the first signs that      your water intake is inadequate. Because the rest of the      body has a higher priority for water, the intestinal tract      can be shortchanged, and the result is hard stools.      Unfortunately, few people heed this warning. Instead, folks      typically head for the drugstore to buy medication that      forces the rest of the system to return water from its own      limited supply to the intestinal tract. Of course, such a      "cure" is only temporary and actually compounds the      problem.    </p>    <p>      Yet another easily recognized symptom is dark yellow urine.      Our kidneys are equipped with millions of filtering units      to remove impurities and return the purified fluid to the      bloodstream. Since filtration is the organ's first      priority, it will continue its job even if this means      producing a very highly concentrated urine. Over a long      period of time this can lead to the development of kidney      stones, urinary tract infections, and other bladder      problems.    </p>    <p>      "Dry mouth," caused by decreased salivary gland function,      can also result from low water intake. On the other hand, a      person who drinks enough water seems not to need much      during meals, since his or her saliva glands are operating      properly.    </p>    <p>      When you realize that 60% to 70% of your total body weight      is made up of water, it's not too difficult to understand      that nearly every function of the body happens in a more or      less liquid medium. In fact, without the amazing recycling      operation of the kidneys, you'd have to drink approximately      2,500 gallons (or 40,000 cupfuls) of water every day!    </p>    <p>      So you have a choice to make: You can get water by      recycling it, so to speak, which overrefines a limited      supply through the body's filters, or you can consume more      fresh water. If you take the first route, you risk actually      increasing the impurities in your body by not giving it an      adequate amount of diluting liquid. In fact, when a person      becomes dehydrated, he or she loses moisture from all of      the body's cells. This in turn allows the by-products of      cell metabolism to build up and can slow the operation of,      or actually poison, the cells.    </p>    <h3>      How Much Is Enough?    </h3>    <p>      Generally speaking, the average person loses at least two      cups of water daily through the respiratory process.      Another two cups are emitted through perspiration, even      when no significant amount of physical work is carried on,      and the intestines and kidneys together lose a total of      about six cups during the day. So if you add it all      together, you come up with a total loss of ten cups (and      that's not counting any excess lost through perspiration      during exercise).    </p>    <p>      Next, consider where the body gets its fluids . . . or      better still, where it <em>should</em> get them. Because      most food contains a large amount of water, you obtain      approximately 3-1/2 cups from what is eaten over the course      of a day. Interestingly, the body's metabolism itself is      another source; as it makes and uses energy, one of its      daily byproducts is about half a cup of water.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, taking into account the approximately four cups      provided by food and metabolism, and the ten cups lost, the      average person needs to drink six to eight cups of water      daily just to keep functioning well. This requirement      changes, of course, according to the environment and the      type and quantity of food you eat. A person spending a hot      day mowing the lawn would obviously require more liquid      than someone relaxing in the shade, and a marathon runner      may drink as much as a cup of water for every 15 minutes of      running.    </p>    <p>      The body cannot economize on water. Because temperature      control has a very high priority in the body's operation,      the human system will dehydrate itself in the struggle to      keep cool. It's been reported that such fluid losses can      actually reach two quarts a day in very hot climates, and      people have been known to lose as much as 15 quarts in 24      hours. In fact, perspiration continues to provide cooling      even when a person is dying of thirst in the desert!    </p>    <p>      Most of us will never experience such drastic fluid loss,      but the more rapidly you lose water, the more quickly you      need to replace it if you're to continue to function      without becoming fatigued.    </p>    <p>      Water intake is also related to the amount of food you eat.      Research has shown that an adult needs approximately one      cubic centimeter of water for each calorie consumed. So if      you consume 2,000 calories a day, you should drink 2,000 cc      (roughly & 8-1/2 cups) of water.    </p>    <p>      If you don't know how many calories you're averaging daily,      you can estimate your need for liquid by dividing your      ideal weight by two, which will indicate the number of      ounces of water you should be drinking. To find out how      many <em>cups</em> you need, divide this quotient by eight.      For example, a fit person weighing 150 pounds would come up      with a calculation of 75 ounces, or 9 to 9-1/2 cups. If,      however, you weigh 160 pounds but <em>should</em> be 30      pounds lighter, you'd compute your water needs using that      "should be" figure.    </p>    <p>      Now that you know how much water you need, the next      question is <em>when</em> you should drink it. It's usually      best to replace liquid as your body eliminates it. In other      words, there's no point in getting up in the morning and      downing your eight cups all at once. Your kidneys would      soon eliminate this excess, and it wouldn't be available      when you needed it later in the day. However, after a      night's sleep, your body is somewhat dehydrated, so you      should start replacing water by drinking about two cups at      least 15 minutes before you have breakfast. Once you've had      your morning meal, wait a couple of hours to make sure your      food has left your stomach, and then have another two cups.      Drink two or three more throughout the afternoon, and have      one or two after supper. This adds up to a total of seven      or more cups of water during the course of your day.    </p>    <p>      Two things are likely to happen if you follow this regimen.      First, your thirst will be quenched. Second, not only will      you replace the fluids your body needs, but you'll do so      with a liquid that may be more healthful than that which      you normally imbibe.    </p>    <h3>      Bad Habits    </h3>    <p>      Let's take a look at some of America's most popular      beverages. The first is coffee, which eight out of ten      adults consume at an average of 3-1/2 cups a day. That may      not sound like a lot, but it accounts for about 76% of the      nearly 34 million pounds of caffeine Americans consume      annually, and that drug has an interesting effect on the      body. Obviously, it acts as a stimulant. It causes the      adrenal glands above the kidneys to pour out two very      powerful chemicals: epinephrine and norepinephrine. Those,      in turn, cause a rise in blood pressure, constricting blood      vessels and giving one a feeling of increased mental acuity      and physical ability. However, this stimulation is      short-lived, so people who drink the brew habitually need a      coffee break in the midmorning and again in midafternoon to      keep them going throughout the day.    </p>    <p>      To avoid this, some people turn to decaffeinated coffee.      While it's true that this beverage has had most of the      caffeine removed, that process doesn't have any effect on      the caffeols that account for coffee's flavor and aroma.      And, unfortunately, these fragrant oils irritate the      stomach lining, causing it to produce excess amounts of      hydrochloric acid, which can play a prominent role in the      development of stomach ulcers.    </p>    <p>      Yet another popular beverage is the carbonated soft drink,      which usually is composed of water, sugar, and artificial      colorings and flavorings. It has little or no nutritional      value and may even have stimulants (including caffeine) in      it. Yet Americans consume <em>millions of gallons</em> of      these liquids every <em>week.</em>    </p>    <p>      A third fluid many of us drink (to our detriment) is      alcohol. Most research indicates that if liquor is drunk in      moderation, it isn't harmful. However, consider the recent      study done at the University of Florida's College of      Medicine. Researchers gave one group of men, ranging in age      from their 20s to their mid-60s, plain orange juice before      bedtime, while another group drank a shot of vodka. When      the research staff followed the reactions of these men      throughout their sleeping hours, it was found that those      who drank alcohol had a significant increase in disturbed      breathing during the night (some even stopped breathing for      as long as ten seconds). The study also determined that      these normal, healthy, asymptomatic men experienced a      decrease in the oxygen-carrying ability of their blood.    </p>    <p>      Drinking fruit juices isn't always the best alternative,      either. When the fibers and pulp, which play a vital role      in the digestion of fruit, are removed, the concentration      of natural sugars is increased. These are then absorbed      much more rapidly by the body. Since this can be a problem      for anyone with a prediabetic or diabetic condition, it's      generally best to eat the whole fruit rather than drink its      juice.    </p>    <h3>      The Ultimate Thirst Quencher    </h3>    <p>      If you increase your water intake, you'll probably decrease      your consumption of the other beverages that so often crowd      out this life-sustaining liquid. "But water just doesn't      appeal to me at all," you may complain. Well, remember that      appetites can be changed. Although it's been said that it      takes 39 days of continual practice to develop a new habit,      the process may get easier as that period goes on, and      eventually you'll reach a point where you actually      <em>crave</em> water. In fact, people who have become      accustomed to having their bodies well hydrated sometimes      find that they become thirsty much more frequently than      before. Just as their bodies once adjusted to being given      <em>little</em> water, they have adjusted to an increased      supply.    </p>    <p>      To help you attain the goal of proper water consumption,      make up a chart and tabulate the number of cups you drink      upon arising, throughout the morning, during the afternoon,      and in the evening. The following general rules may help      you achieve a healthful regimen.    </p>    <p>      First, don't drink any water within 15 minutes before      eating. Second, give your stomach up to an hour and a half      after meals to digest most of your food undiluted by water;      mealtime is not the time to take in large amounts of      liquid. (Milk is the only beverage that serves as an      exception to this rule, since it becomes a semisolid in the      stomach.)    </p>    <p>      As you do your day's work, put a cup of water in front of      you. When it's emptied, fill it up again. You'll be      astonished at how much you toss off without any difficulty.      Make it a habit to stop and refresh yourself every time you      pass a drinking fountain. Or try putting a pitcher      containing your estimated daily requirement of water in the      refrigerator, and periodically have a glass until it's used      up.    </p>    <p>      Initially, you may find yourself visiting the rest room      more frequently than you have in the past. There's nothing      wrong with this. Don't worry that you'll wear out your      kidneys! With an adequate supply of water, they'll actually      have a much easier time functioning normally.    </p>    <p>      Finally, try to be patient with yourself. It does take time      for the body to adapt. It also takes time to learn a new      habit. <em>This</em> one, however, is <em>good</em> for      you!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: This article was adapted from a six part      seminar developed by Dr. Philip Collins, a health      consultant for Carolina Health Care.
