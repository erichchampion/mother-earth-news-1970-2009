            		<p>      <strong>From Mother No. 82</strong>    </p>          <p>      The memory of a childhood paddle wheel helped this      inventive gardener get water to his plants!</p>      <h5 id="byline">By Richard N. McCray</h5>    <p>      I got my first taste of waterwheels at the age of five,      when my great-grandfather McDowell made me a toy paddle      turbine to run under the spring-fed spigot at the back of      the house. Today, some 65 years later, I've applied the      principles of that early lesson to building a full-sized      undershot wheel that provides me with every drop of water I      need to supply my thirsty garden throughout the entire      growing season.    </p>    <p>      My vegetable plot, you see, is quite a distance from the      house and its plumbing. True, the garden is located not far      from a small perennial mountain stream that forms the      southern boundary of our property . . . but that "crick"      runs a good 8' or so <em>below</em> my patch!    </p>    <p>      Now I certainly don't have an aversion to honest work, but      the drudgery of using a hand pump to fill a washtub,      lugging the sloshing vessel around, and repeating this      operation at least six times <em>every time I</em> wanted      to water my garden forced me to look for a less      labor-intensive means of getting the job done. Naturally,      that first waterwheel in my life came to mind, so I set      about researching the design and operation of functional      "paddle pumps" in hopes of building one at my site that'd      handle my watering chores with a minimum of maintenance.    </p>    <h3>      Early Planning Paid Off    </h3>    <p>      Because there was only about 4" of fall in the part of the      stream bordering our land, an overshot wheel was out of the      question. Unfortunately, I had little luck digging up      specific information on <em>undershot</em> wheels, so I had      to use common sense-and a by-guess-and-by-golly      approach-to make my project a success.    </p>    <p>      Early in the game I decided that an allwood wheel would be      too expensive and time-consuming to assemble. So,      considering the fact that an undershot design uses      <em>paddles</em> rather than the intricate buckets of an      overshot apparatus, I figured I'd search for a metal-spoked      wheel about 4' or 5' in diameter and simply fasten some      plywood paddles with 1'-square blades to it.    </p>    <p>      I started by roughly calculating what I had to work with in      the way of water. The creek usually runs about 2" deep at      an 8' width. To create a weir that would direct the flow      toward the center of the stream (thus enhancing its depth      and velocity when at normal levels) but still withstand the      punishment of occasional deluges, I piled rocks in the      creek until the center channel was 16" wide and the      water-normally-was about 8" deep .. .      dimensions that I thought would be about right for the size      of wheel I had in mind.    </p>    <p>      Then, to get an idea of the water's force within the      channel, I held a foot-wide board in that sluiceway and      used a small scale to determine the stream's "push" on the      piece of wood . . . a force of about 7-1/2 pounds.    </p>    <p>      Next, I calculated the velocity of the water. I laid two      long poles across the creek, 10' apart, and floated several      sticks on the surface while I timed their progress. The      average figure-4 seconds to cover the 10'      distance-was then multiplied by 15 to arrive at 150'      per minute.    </p>    <p>      Now comes the <em>fancy</em> part: I'd found a 4      1/2'-diameter, 16-spoke metal wheel from an old hay rake      and figured out a way to mount a 12" X 12" paddle to the      rim at each spoke (I'll tell you just how I did that later      in this article). To establish the estimated rotational      speed of the completed wheel, then, I just added the 27"      radius of its steel rim to the distance from that rim to      the 8" <em>centerline</em> of the water's force on the      paddles, and came up with a lever arm of 35".    </p>    <p>      The old formula C = 2¶r gave me an overall      circumference of 220", or 18.3'. Using the flow rate of 150      feet per minute through the weir channel, I      calculated-by dividing 150 by 18.3-that the      whole shebang would theoretically turn at about 8      revolutions per minute (RPM). Of course, knowing from      experience that theory tends to be more optimistic than      reality, I cut that estimate in half to account for      slippage and friction after the wheel and pump were      installed. (As it turned out, the wheel's actual speed      averages just over 5 RPM!)    </p>    <p>      At this point I knew approximately how fast the wheel would      rotate, but I still had to deduce how much torque it would      provide in order to size my pump properly. A scaled-down      sketch of the side view showed that with one paddle dipping      8" into the water, the adjacent paddles would each be      submerged 4", which would be equivalent to having two      paddles fully in the water at any given time, each      furnishing a 71/2pound force from the current. By      multiplying the 35" lever arm by the 15pound force from the      two paddles, I arrived at 525 inch-pounds-or about 44      foot-pounds-of torque available to power the pump.    </p>    <p>      Armed with the numbers I'd worked out, I could now decide      just how I was going to mount the wheel so it would      function under various flow conditions . . . and work out a      pump design that'd be compatible with the arrangement I      would finally settle on.    </p>    <h3>      Getting the Right Frame in Mind    </h3>    <p>      Since the normally shallow creek would get several feet      deep during a flood, I was a good bit concerned about      <em>protecting</em> my water pumper. Consequently, I      decided to set the wheel up on a frame so it'd swing with      the stronger currents . . . rather than holding fast and      trying to buck them.    </p>    <p>      To make the frame's pilings, I took two 4' lengths of      1-1/4" galvanized pipe, slashcut one end of each, and then      threaded the remaining ends. Next, after capping the      threads, I drove one pointed stub down into the ground on      the creek bank and the other into the streambed itself so      that the pipes were in line with the weir channel and far      enough apart to accommodate the wheel and the swinging      carriage I had in mind.    </p>    <p>      That done, I removed the pipe caps and threaded a union to      the end of each pile, then fastened a short nipple and a      90° elbow to the post on the bank. I had about 12' of      1-1/4" pipe available to use for the cross-support, so I      threaded one end of that section into the elbow and held      the other end aloft-temporarily-on a tall      wooden X frame. After checking with a level to make sure      that the cross-pipe was horizontal, I used a plumb bob to      determine where to cut it so it'd line up with the vertical      post in the creek bed. Then I threaded that end, installed      another elbow, and joined the horizontal conduit to the bed      mount with a pipe of appropriate length. (I also clamped a      1/4" steel cable to the corner of this framework and      fastened its other end to an anchor driven into the bank      upstream . . . as extra insurance to prevent the force of      the water from buckling the structure.)    </p>    <p>      My next task was to build the swinging carriage that would      support the wheel and keep it in line. I started by welding      the two 6' lengths of 1/8" X 2" X 2" angle iron that would      hold the wheel <em>perpendicularly to</em> one side of a 5'      piece of 1/8" X 1" X 2" channel iron so that they were      centered, about 20" apart, and parallel to one another.      Next, I cut a 40" section of angle iron, scrounged up a      5/8" X 19" piece of steel rod, and used both those chunks      as braces between the channel and the angle iron.    </p>    <p>      Then-using the groove in the channel iron-I      hung the carriage from my 1-1/4" pipe framework and welded      a couple of 1/2" X 1" X 3" tabs to the channel opposite      each 6' parallel arm so that I could run 3/8" X 3" bolts      through the pieces to create a sort of hinge. (A U-bolt      later fastened to the pipe at each end of the carriage      hanger keeps the chassis from shifting <em>sideways</em>      when the wheel's in operation.) And, to provide a place to      mount my pump-one that would also swing with the      carriage-I bolted a 1/4" X 8" X 8" plate to the angle      iron arm nearest the garden.    </p>    <h3>      Wheeling and Dealing    </h3>        <p>      The wheel was my next concern, and I tackled that problem      by first enlarging its center hole to 1-3/8" in diameter .      . . tapping the oiling orifice for 1/8" pipe and installing      a grease fitting ... and drilling-then      threading-a 1/2" setscrew hole in the center of the      hub. A 1-3/8" X 30" cold-rolled shaft served as an axle,      and I decided to make my own bearings out of white oak      instead of purchasing conventional steel rollers . . .      which might seize after repeated floodings. To do this, I      bored a 1-7/16" hole through the cores of two 3" X 4" X 4"      blocks, and then drilled 5/16" mounting holes through the      shoulders, centered and perpendicular to the large bores.      After sawing both blocks in half-"splitting" the axle      holes in two-I cut grease channels and a feed into      each bearing. Next, I temporarily mounted the wheel and      axle assembly, within the bearings, to the 6' angle iron      swing arms . . . taking into account the necessary      clearance for the 12" paddles.    </p>    <p>      Since I knew I wanted the working ends of the paddles to      measure 12" X 12", I extended their length to 2' to provide      enough surface area for a sturdy mount. I used a piece of      scrap 1/4" plywood to make my first 12" X 24" blade, which      I trimmed to the shape shown in the photos and then slotted      and drilled so it'd slip over the wheel rim and rest      against a spoke.    </p>    <p>      Once I was satisfied that the shape and mounting      arrangement would be satisfactory, I made up a sturdy      sheet-aluminum template and used it to mark out my 16      paddles on two slabs of 1/2" X 4' X 8' marine plywood. By      nailing four cutout blanks together, and drilling and      sawing holes and rim slots as a group, I found that I could      place those openings quite accurately. And after all the      blades were cut, I covered them with several coats of deck      paint for extra protection against the water.    </p>    <p>      To fasten the paddles to the rim, I used a pair of 1/4" X      1-3/8" U-bolts at each spoke, and to strengthen the wood at      the slotted part of the blades, I made up a total of 32      aluminum strips measuring 1/8" X 2" X 4-7/8", which I      bolted over the slots in pairs with 3/16" X 1-1/4" brass      machine screws. (The sections of plywood removed when the      slots were cut were shortened, put back in, and used to      <em>center</em> the aluminum bridges.)    </p>    <h3>      Different Strokes . . .    </h3>    <p>      Now that the wheel and framing were completed, I felt I'd      really accomplished something . . . but I still had to      figure out <em>-and</em> construct-a pump      that'd work with my setup. To keep things simple, I set my      sights on a single-acting pump (which creates suction and      pressure on one side of the piston only) so I wouldn't have      to provide a packing gland for the piston rod. At the same      time, I figured I'd mount its cylinder on a swivel, thus      eliminating the need for a connecting rod and guides.    </p>    <p>      But the question of how much displacement I could have      still remained. I knew the length of the pump mechanism      would be limited to 42" (the distance from the wheel's axle      center to the upper frame member). So I finally settled on      a 9" throw for my crank, which meant that my piston would      travel 18" . . . and that the two parts together would take      up 27" overall. This would leave 15" for the pump fittings      and swivel bracket, a working space I could easily live      with.    </p>    <p>      Choosing the cylinder bore proved to be a compromise      between what I wanted and what was available in standard      hardware. A quick wheel-force diagram showed me that the      15-pound force acting on my paddles at 35" from the      centerline on the shaft-and <em>then</em> transferred      through a 9" crank-would amount to 35 divided by 9      (or 3.88), multiplied by 15 . . . a healthy 58.3 pounds of      force.    </p>    <p>      Dividing this number by the area of the piston (I decided      on a 2" Schedule 40 PVC pipe cylinder, so its      cross-sectional area-using good ol' ¶r 2      -was 3.14 square inches) gave me the available      pressure of the pump (18.6 pounds per square inch). From      there, since I knew that it took 0.43 psi to raise water      one foot in height, I could calculate the total head the      pump would deliver (43.25 feet . . . plenty for my      purposes) by simple division.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, with all my "unknowns" known, it was easy for      me to calculate that, guessing my wheel speed at 4 RPM, the      2" X 18" pipe pump could deliver roughly 13,565 cubic      inches, or 58 gallons, per hour . . . which would amount to      almost 1,400 gallons a day!    </p>    <p>      Acquiring the pump's components was simply a matter of      going to the local hardware and plumbing supply store and      picking out the parts I needed. My cylinder was just an 18"      length of 2" Schedule 40 PVC pipe, equipped at one end with      a 2" slip-to-pipe female adapter and at the other with the      same type of fitting terminated in a male thread. I screwed      the latter end into the common of a 2" galvanized T, then      bushed the T's other two ends down to 1/2". On the intake      end, I used a short nipple to a 1/2" swing check valve.      Then I concentrated on creating the piston parts.    </p>    <p>      The piston rod, a 5/8" X 26" stainless steel shaft,      required a bit of machine work, since it had to be threaded      at each end. One tip just needed a 5/8-11 thread 1-3/4"      long, but the other had to be cut down to a 1/2" diameter      for a distance of 1". A 5/8"-long 1/2-13 thread was added      to this stub . . . which left a 3/8" length of      <em>smooth</em> surface between the threads and the step to      the rod's 5/8" diameter.    </p>    <p>      With this done, I drilled a 21/32" hole directly in the      center of a 2" galvanized pipe plug, then slipped the      piston rod through that opening so its 1/2" end was on the      same side as the pipe threads. A couple of body      washers-with 1/2" center bores and 15/8" outside      diameters-made excellent buttresses after I curved      their edges slightly with a file and sandwiched two      2"-diameter leather piston cups between them. A 1/2" nut      and a cotter pin held this homemade piston in place on the      end of the shaft, and to alleviate the effects of water on      the leather, I soaked the parts in neat's-foot oil before      slipping the piston in place and threading the pipe plug to      the cylinder's plastic adapter. (The leather plunger will      slide home much more easily if you carefully taper the end      of the cylinder's bore with a file.)    </p>    <p>      The connector at the opposite end of the piston rod was      just a 1" X 1" X 3" block of steel drilled and tapped 1"      deep at one end to match the rod, and cross-drilled at its      other end to a 17/32" diameter. The wheel crank-a      3/8" X 2" X 11" piece of flat steel-was drilled out      on a 9" center to join the 1-3/8" axle and the connector,      and I welded a 1-9/16" length of 1-1/4" pipe to the      large-holed end, and a 3/4" piece of 1"-diameter      cold-rolled rod (tapped for 1/2-13 thread) to the other, to      serve as crank collars.    </p>    <p>      Once I'd fabricated those metal parts, I constructed the      swivel bracket that would hold the pump in place. That      involved trimming out a 6" X 8" piece of 1/8" steel plate,      welding two 1/4" X 3" X 3" X 3" angle iron sections to one      end of this platform so that the lips were aligned with the      plate's sides, and drilling a 1/2" hole 1" from the end of      the plate at the butt joint of the two angles.    </p>    <p>      To mount the pump to the bracket, I drilled a 7/8" hole      that was centered and 2" from the baseplate through each of      the upright angle iron lips and let the 1/2" pipe nipples      on the T serve as fastening pins. I then pinioned the      swivel bracket to the 8" X 8" mounting plate on the wheel      carriage, using a 1/2" X 1-1/2" bolt, two nuts, and a      cotter pin.    </p>    <p>      Having come this far, I breathed easy: The rest was just a      matter of fitting and finetuning. To check the wheel's      lateral play, I cut a section of 1-1/4" Schedule 40 pipe      into three lengths (3", 4-11/32", and 4-19/32"), and used      two as spacers <em>between</em> the wheel hub and the      bearing blocks and the third as a keeper collar on the end      of the shaft opposite the pump. Also, I placed 21/4"      outside diameter flat thrust washers between the pipes and      the wooden parts, tightened the hub's 1/2" setscrew, and      locked the collars to the main shaft with 3/8" X 2" machine      bolts.    </p>    <p>      Then I fit the crank to its end of the shaft (securing it      by-once more-using the technique of tightening      a bolt run through a hole drilled in the axle) and fastened      its other end to the piston-rod connector with a 1/2" X 3"      bolt and a lock nut. (I'll tell you now, if you try a      similar project yourself, be sure to employ some form of      locking mechanism-whether it's cotter pins or a      thread seal ant-on all your fasteners, or you'll be      retightening them on a regular basis!)    </p>    <p>      Before I set the wheel into the water, I had to finish up      the plumbing. On the suction side, I just ran a 6' length      of heavy-walled plastic hose that terminated at an adapter      and a 3/4" foot valve submerged in the water. To protect      the pump from foreign matter, I wrapped the intake with      aluminum screening . . . and later made up a      gravity-operated sand trap-from some 2" Schedule 40      PVC pipe, a T, a 90° elbow, and a bit of woven filter      packing-which I placed in line between the foot valve      and the pump to catch and settle out the debris.    </p>    <p>      On the pressure side (the one with the swing check valve),      I installed a 1/2" nipple and T to the check and threaded a      small pressure gauge into one of the T's ports. I then ran      my supply hose to the garden area and terminated it in a      garden-hose fitting and another T . . . which I plan to put      to use later on when I can get around to installing a      pressurized holding tank and a small, decorative fountain.    </p>    <p>      Finally, I filled the wheel hub with grease to keep it from      rusting to the shaft, ran plastic oil lines to the oaken      bearings, and let the machine down into the water.    </p>    <h3>      Success at Last    </h3>    <p>      You've probably guessed that my waterwheel performed just      as I expected it to. But it really surprised me the first      time the water level in the stream increased to a foot or      so. Then the wheel turned at a very respectable 11 RPM and      could have delivered 3,875 gallons of H 2 0 to my garden in      the course of a day. The only real problem I've experienced      with my highly competent water pusher is the occasional      "logjamming" that occurs when debris is carried downstream      in high waters, and I solved the worst of that easily      enough by driving lengths of closely spaced pipe into the      creek bed upstream of the machinery.    </p>    <p>      So after waiting 65 years, I finally built a useful version      of my great-grandpa McDowell's toy waterwheel. With a total      investment of about $250 in the project and a lush crop of      vegetables as a result, I can't complain about the many      (enjoyable) hours of spare time it took me to bring my      childhood fancy to reality.    </p>    <p>      Waterwheel Illustration    </p>
