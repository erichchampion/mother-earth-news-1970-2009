            		<p>      From Mother No. 84    </p>		<p>      Marshall Price's "Basement-Built"</p>              <p>      A low-investment windplant that's a backyard tinkerer's      dream    </p>        <p>      "Dunkirk Man Builds Windmill at Modest Investment; Cuts His      Utility Bill." That headline, followed by a short article,      ran in the August 1, 1978, edition of western New York's      Dunkirk-Fredonia <em>Evening Observer.</em> Hardly      earth-shattering news, but it did stick in the memory of      MOTHER's editors . . . one of whom paid a visit to Mr.      Price at his home on the shores of Lake Erie.    </p>    <p>      And what our staffer saw there was yet another example of      commonsense <em>appropriate</em> technology: Mr. Price, a      typewriter repairman by trade and a part-time machinist and      welder, had pieced together-for about $300-a      wind-driven electrical generator . . . one that has      supplied much of his home's electrical needs since Mother's      Day of 1976!    </p>    <h3>      Make Do, and Make It Work    </h3>    <p>      Marshall's story really began after the Price family built      their lakeside residence nearly 18 years ago. The constant      breeze blowing off the water served as an everpresent      reminder that free energy was going begging . . . but it      wasn't until Mr. Price started collecting information on      wind machines, and ran across "a little red book on      homemade energy" <em>(THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> Handbook of      Homemade Power),</em> that he finally found the answer to      the problem that had been keeping him from building his own      plant: the need for information concerning the design and      fabrication of the all-important wooden blades. Once he'd      uncovered that technique, the rest, for the most part, was      a matter of locating junkyard parts and fitting them      together so they'd be compatible with one another and with      the nature of the lakeside breezes.    </p>    <p>      "One thing about the wind here," he told us, "it's darned      unpredictable. It can be blowing nicely at a steady 18      miles per hour, and then all of a sudden it whips up to 30      knots without so much as a how do you do. On top of that,      it changes direction just as erratically . . . and that can      play the devil with your equipment. A 12' rotor spinning at      200 RPM or so has tremendous inertia, and doesn't take      easily to being reoriented."    </p>    <p>      It was critical, then, that Marshall Price plan for these      contingencies before beginning the construction of his      plant. He first scrounged a Delco ambulance alternator that      was capable of delivering 147 amps at about 15 volts . . .      which figures out to be over 2,000 watts in a very strong      breeze. After reconditioning this component, the      do-it-yourselfer started working on a governor system      that'd allow his three 6' blades to feather-that is,      pivot on their mounts-when wind speeds got      dangerously high. (When feathered, the blades are less      effective as airfoils, and thus keep the rotor's RPM within      safe limits.)    </p>    <p>      The hub-mounted control setup Price came up with is similar      to the type Marcellus Jacobs used on his well-known wind      machines. "I'd read stories about Jacobs, and I wanted to      know how his governor worked. I finally located a copy of a      drawing from an old service manual, studied it, and then      built my own version. It acts on centrifugal force and uses      lead weights, linkages, and springs to control the blades'      pitch. I knew I wanted a top speed of about 230 RPM on the      power shaft, so I just used the trial-and-error method to      set up the governor correctly. During the winter I made a      little testing stand in the basement and mounted the hub on      it . . . then I drove the unit with a belt connected to my      walking tractor's engine, took RPM readings off the hub      using a tachometer, and experimented with the governor      until I got it right. I've been using it ever since, and,      by gosh, it works!"    </p>    <p>      Of course, if it's to generate usable electricity, the      alternator must spin a good deal faster than 230 RPM, so      Marshall set about making a gearbox that would step up the      generator's speed considerably. To accomplish this, he just      welded a housing out of 1/4" plate and mounted two salvaged      Chevrolet gearsets inside. The 8.2-to-1 ratio thus created      means that for every one turn the power shaft on the hub      makes, the alternator shaft spins 8.2 times . . . or about      1,800 RPM in near-gale (36 mph) winds.    </p>    <p>      The power shaft itself was recycled from an old Datsun. "I      bought the whole car for $10, then sold the body to a      junkyard for $15. That left me with the entire drivetrain      <em>and</em> a profit of $5.00. I stripped out the swing      arms from the independent rear suspension, used one for the      windplant-bearings and all-and kept the other as a      spare."    </p>    <p>      Having taken care of governing the high-speed performance      of his generator, Mr. Price had to consider control at low      RPM, as well. He used a centrifugally activated      microswitch-snitched from an electric typewriter-to      energize the alternator's field windings when the shaft      speed reached approximately 750 RPM. Translated into wind      velocity, that means that the generator doesn't start      charging until the breezes reach 7 or 8 mph. Below that      speed, the alternator is ineffective anyway, so there's      little use in allowing battery power to drain into the      field circuit at such times.    </p>    <p>      Finally, to protect his equipment from the inevitable heavy      blows that occur periodically, Marshall hinged and "loaded"      the windplant's tail frame so it could be folded parallel      to the plane of the blades when necessary. A small cable      winch mounted at the base of the tower keeps the tail      perpendicular to the rotor path under normal conditions,      making maximum use of the wind . . . but when that cable is      released, the vane swings to one side, presenting the tips,      rather than the faces, of the blades to the breeze so the      rotor can't overspin.    </p>    <p>      This method of restraint is commonly used in upwind      machines, but in this case, Mr. Price again took a tip from      the Jacobs design and set the tail springs so they'd shut      <em>down</em> the windplant if the cable broke, rather than      open it to the full force of a storm. Marshall points out      that he can take advantage of his machine even in strong      winds, simply by unwinding the winch partially and allowing      his blades to face the breeze at an angle, so they'll spill      off a good deal of wind and yet continue to turn rapidly      enough to generate power.    </p>		<h3>Handmade Redwood Blades</h3>    <p>      A knack for scrounging, coupled with the ability to      understand the potential of each junk component, aided      Price immeasurably in bringing his project to completion.      But he knew from the start that he'd have to fashion the      wooden blades from scratch.    </p>    <p>      "I went and handpicked three straight-grain redwood 2 X 8s      from the lumberyard, then cut and shaped them according to      the specifications in the homemade power book. Because      windplant blades are driven by the wind-they don't      drive into it themselves as an aircraft propeller      does-their contour must differ from that of a      standard propeller to work correctly. After I'd formed and      sanded the wood, I protected it with fiberglass resin and      matting-coating it evenly to maintain proper balance      at speed-then roughed up the glass lightly and gave      each blade another coat.    </p>    <p>      "Now those redwood airfoils aren't just bolted to the hub .      . . each spar coming off the governor pinions is      7/8"-diameter coldrolled steel, and extends a full 20" into      a socket that's been bored into the blade. Furthermore,      these internal spines are pinned through the wooden      shoulders, and I've also got them sandwiched on the outside      with 6" X 6" metal plates. This way, I can have my      feathering feature as a governor, and still feel      comfortable about the integrity of those redwood blades at      higher wind speeds."    </p>		<h3>The Chain's Weak Link</h3>    <p>      After fabricating the blades and working out the best      method of mounting them, Marshall had only to erect a tower      and place the plant atop it. Since the source of wind is      generally from the lakeside quadrants and doesn't suffer      interference from trees or hills, it wasn't necessary for      Mr. Price to build a fancy lolly pivot or to rely upon      altitude to catch the best breezes. He simply sank a length      of well casing into a concrete footer, leaving about 18' of      the casing exposed. Then he mounted the generator and      gearbox on a frame and set that into the tower so it would      pivot on a vertical axis. Double-aught copper cables      (purchased at scrap prices from the local power company),      given plenty of slack to allow for yaw, carry generated      current to the battery bank.    </p>    <p>      Energy storage is, according to Price, the weak link in his      system. "There's absolutely no problem at all in      <em>making</em> the power . . . that's the easy part. But      decent storage-something that's affordable and can still      take the abuse of constant charge and discharge-is      darned hard to come by."    </p>    <p>      Marshall wanted [1] a system that would allow him to be      somewhat independent of the power companies, and [2] one      that would be working even when the wind wasn't. As his      setup stands now, the outsized alternator generates      alternating current, which is rectified to direct current      through diodes, then stored in a mixed grill of batteries      composed of 2- and 6-volt cell blocks. That bank is wired      in a series-parallel circuit to achieve 12 volts total, and      that power is fed through a stand-alone inverter that      converts the storable DC back into AC, for use throughout      most of the house.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Price doesn't use a voltage regulator on his system,      because the batteries-when they're      depleted-require a good three days of steady wind to      even approach the overcharging point. In fact, he simply      uses his appliances as indicators of his storage bank's      state of charge: "I can tell by the way the lights bum. If      they're too bright, I know I'm getting more than 13 volts      instead of my usual 12.5, so I have to shut down the plant.      On the other hand, if the batteries are low, the picture on      my color TV gets distorted-in the upper right-hand corner,      and that tells me it's time to crank the tail out straight      again. A few years back, we had a nine-day spell without      any appreciable breeze, and the cells were able to handle      that, so I'm not too worried about my storage capacity."    </p>    <p>      Of course, batteries <em>do</em> lose their effectiveness.      But Price stresses the importance of maintaining a      cost-effective approach to these essential pieces of      equipment. He cites as an example an offer that was made to      him some time ago: "A fellow had three huge Pullman car      batteries that he wanted $3,700 for. Now if I'd invested      that amount of money at 10% interest, it would have paid my      power bill for quite a few years to come, so those Pullman      units weren't a good buy. It's better to get a number of      smaller batteries, pay maybe $25 apiece for them, and use      them to the bitter end. They might not last as long, but at      that price I could afford to replace them."    </p>		<h3>A Sound Investment</h3>    <p>      Has Marshall Price's investment-of both dollars and      time-been reasonably rewarded? Interestingly enough,      he admits that, at first, his main objective was simply to      have one wind-powered light source over his reading chair.      Then, as he made improvements in his plant and added more      lights, he boosted his storage capacity as well.      Eventually, seeing that the generator easily kept abreast      of his power usage, he installed the inverter and then tied      other appliances into the line. Today, everything in his      household is powered by the wind, save for the dishwasher,      the washing machine, and the refrigerator . . . and the      cost of operating (and enjoying) those      induction-motor-equipped conveniences usually doesn't      exceed $20 per month.    </p>    <p>      In summary, Marshall Price is an example of someone      who-with the help of his welding and metal-shop      skills-turned several hundred dollars' worth of      scrapyard parts into the equivalent of a      <em>several-thousand-</em> dollar investment . . . one that      demands little more than an annual checkup and a      batteryrecruiting effort every so many years. It doesn't      take a very sharp pencil to make sense of economics like      that . . . because this <em>Price is right!</em>    </p>    <h3>      One Step at a Time    </h3>            <p>      It's not difficult to imagine that many stand in awe of      Marshall Price for taking on such a formidable project and      seeing it through to completion. But even Mr. Price, as a      veteran tinkerer, approached his goal systematically, using      the most basic means at his disposal. If Marshall's success      story has you itching to try your hand at a wind energy      project of your own-but you don't know where to      begin-here are three approaches. The one you choose      will depend upon how comfortable you are with your shop      skills.    </p>    <p>      The simplest' and least expensive project is MOTHER's Red      Baron trainer-a 70-watt wind machine which our      staffers developed as an entry-level undertaking that would      cost less than $100 to build. It'll provide its builder      with some valuable experience and usable electric energy,      and can also serve as a monitor for a proposed wind site.      Six pages of detailed, step-by-step plans and photos are      published in the article beginning on page 96 of MOTHER N0.      92.    </p>    <p>      A more sophisticated windplant (but one that's not much      more difficult to build) was featured in issue 93. Dubbed      the Blue Max, the 350-watt wind generator is a reliable      power producer that can be built for as little as $200. It,      like the trainer model, uses off-the-shelf plumbing      fittings as frame components, so assembly is almost a      cut-and-paste operation. Because there's more detail work      involved with this machine, we put together a set of      construction plans (in addition to providing information in      the five-page published article). They're available at a      cost of $10.00, plus $1.50 shipping and handling, by      writing to Blue Max, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> PLANS, P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, NC 28793.    </p>    <p>      Finally, if you feel confident about tackling an advanced      workshop project, Marshall Price has cooperated with      MOTHER's staffers in producing a plans package that details      his 2,000-watt wind machine. The package costs $15.00, plus      $1.50 to cover shipping and handling, and is available from      the address above; please specify Price windplant when you      order.    </p>
