               <p><strong>      From MOTHER NO. 58.</strong>    </p>        <h3>      Chickens & Pickin's    </h3>    <p>      It's bug-picking season, so a lot of conscientious      gardeners will be pouring kerosene into old tomato cans and      dropping in all the Japanese beetles, bean weevils, potato      bugs, cucumber beetles . . . and other assorted nasties      that they can get their mitts on. But at least one backyard      grower-Charles Rice of Highland, New York-will      carry a bit of salad oil in his bug can instead of the      traditional kerosene.    </p>    <p>      Charles says that the cooking liquid will immobilize hungry      veggivores as well as the lamplighting fluid does. Better      yet, though-when his task is finished-he'll      have super-protein-rich hors d'oeuvres to feed to his      chickens!    </p>        <h3>      Anti-Ants    </h3>        <p>      If ants invade your kitchen, attach flypaper-sticky      side out-along the bottom of your cabinets (or around      table legs) to form an impenetrable barrier. By the time      you have to change your adhesive sheets, the social little      insects will probably realize they're not wanted . . . and      move on to happier hunting grounds.    </p>    <p>      From MOTHER'S Almanac, 1982.    </p>    <h3>      Free Mulch    </h3>    <p>      "Want some excellent-and <em>free-</em> garden      mulch?" asks Jackson, Ohio's George W. Clark. "Then keep      your eye on the weather during haying season. A good      rainstorm will probably ruin any bales that farmers leave      in their fields. And chances are, the weather cursed folks      will give the drenched hay to you . . . just for the effort      of hauling it away."    </p>    <p>      From MOTHER'S Almanac, 1982.    </p>    <h3>      Make a Mint    </h3>    <p>      Gourmet mint vinegar is easy to make at home. Simply wash      one good handful of fresh mint leaves, shake well, and      bruise them with a mortar and pestle or wooden potato      masher. Pack the leaves in a glass jar and add one quart of      distilled white or pure apple cider vinegar. Cover the      container tightly, and let the mixture stand a good two      weeks. Strain and bottle the elixir (you may want to add a      few drops of green vegetable coloring).    </p>    <p>      If fresh mint is not available, use three tablespoons of      the herb's dried leaves and bring the vinegar to a boil      before pouring it over them.    </p>    <p>      This vinegar is excellent with lamb, good in fruit salad      dressings, and-believe it or not-delicious      frozen into cubes and added to iced drinks.    </p>    <p>      From MOTHER'S Almanac, 1982.    </p>    <h3>      Pickin's Cream Ice    </h3>    <p>      Debi Carr has come up with a nifty way for home-style ice      cream makers to save a bit of trouble and expense. Most      folks, you see, search for a safe place to dump their      usedand salt-laden-ice solution every time they      finish churning . . . but this Spring Valley, California,      lass simply puts her used slush in plastic containers and      refreezes it. The brine solution won't turn completely      solid-and will need some stirring before you can use      it again-but it sure will freeze that next batch of      homemade dessert!    </p>    <p>      From MOTHER NO. 64.    </p>    <h3>      Covering Cauliflowers    </h3>    <p>      You can keep your cauliflower's heads white this summer by      stretching old panty hose legs over them, writes Vicki      Eastwood of Centerville, Kansas. First, neatly overlap the      foliage to cover the developing head . . . then slip on the      stocking and secure it to the stem.    </p>    <p>      What's more, Ruth Baird of Lancaster, Massachusetts,      suggests using the same trick to shield ripening      <em>sunflowers</em> so that the seeds aren't attacked by      hungry birds.    </p>    <p>      From MOTHER NO. 71.    </p>    <h3>      Egg Test    </h3>    <p>      Now that it's summer, some of you will be letting your      chickens out to roam now and again. That's what Minden,      Nebraska's Mary Anne Carlson did . . . but she soon      realized that her hens weren't particular about where they      stopped to lay eggs! Now whenever Mary Anne runs across a      nest somewhere, she tests the eggs for freshness by placing      them in a bucket of water. Any that float to the top are      bad and should be destroyed. Those that stand on one end,      or don't lie flat and "relaxed," are over three days old      and-although still all right for cooking or      baking-probably shouldn't be sold. The rest, she      says, are "farm-fresh"!    </p>    <p>      From MOTHER NO. 76.    </p>    <h3>      A Sharp Trick    </h3>    <p>      "Don't give up on that old, dull vegetable peeler," writes      Dixie McCullough of Mari posa, California. "Try trading it      with a left-handed (or right-handed if you're a southpaw)      friend whose own peeler has lost its verve. After all,      opposite-handed people use opposite sides of the      implement!"    </p>    <p>      From MOTHER'S Almanac, 1982.    </p>    <h3>      Putting Up the Produce    </h3>    <p>      OK folks, we know that your gardens are probably yielding      so much produce that the broccoli needs dinner reservations      . . . and your green beans have to wait in line just to get      into the kitchen! So we're going to share some helpful      food-storing lore from our readers.    </p>    <p>      [1] Sheri Bickel of Fayetteville, Arkansas, blanches      bushel-basket quantities of greens, corn, or string beans      at one time. She simply throws the food loads in her      dishwasher, sets the control on scald (don't add detergent,      <em>please!),</em> and lets the hot water cycle get her      veggies ready for preserving. "They turn out great!" Sheri      says.    </p>    <p>      [2] Think that's something? Well, Sharon Griggs can      cold-pack process three or four canner loads of tomatoes .      . . in one pot! This Dowagiac, Michigan, native takes one      of those old-fashioned elliptical wash boilers (not a tin      washtub), lines the bottom with old towels, sets it over      two burners on her stove, puts in lots of water and filled      jars . . . and starts cooking!    </p>    <p>      Sharon also freezes huge quantities of edibles-using      only a few store-bought containers-by taking the      solidly iced food blocks out of their soft plastic freezer      boxes and storing all the "cubes" of one kind together in      big plastic bags. She can then reuse the expensive      containers over and over again.    </p>    <p>      [3] It looks like Valerie Hannay of Van Buren, Arkansas,      has discovered the perfect storage container for half-quart      food jars: liquor boxes! The cardboard packages that fifths      of booze are shipped in (free for the asking at any alcohol      outlet) have built-in, pint-sized dividers.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, down-home, timetested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday life.
