            		<p>      <strong>From Mother No. 94</strong>    </p>            <p>      Here's how to get a sometimes confusing job done as      efficiently (and effectively) as possible.</p>			<h5 id="byline"> By Susan Glaese</h5>         <p>      At this very moment, somewhere on our vast planet, it's      raining. But at MOTHER's EcoVillage garden, we're in the      middle of a typical summer dry spell . . . so I've been      busy soaking the bases of our tomato plants with a watering      wand.    </p>    <p>      Most of us-with the twist of a spigot-can turn      a garden hose into an umbilical cord linking us to vast      (yet <em>not</em> inexhaustible) underground rivers. And      since many of us don't need to worry about the availability      of water, being blessed with adequate supplies, we can      often afford, instead, to fret about <em>when</em> to water      . . . <em>how much</em> moisture to put down . . . what      <em>implements</em> and <em>techniques</em> are most      appropriate to use . . . and how to <em>conserve</em> as      much water as possible while still nurturing the crops.    </p>    <p>      These are the concerns we'll address in this article. But      first, let's review some fundamentals about . . .    </p>    <h3>      Soil and Water    </h3>    <p>      Water provides more than just <em>liquid</em> to a plant;      it's also the medium that enables nutrients and minerals to      enter the roots. (Roots don't digest dirt-they're not      "woody earthworms"-but instead obtain their nutrients      only in solution.) What's more, through the process of      photosynthesis, some of water's hydrogen is split off to      become a constituent of the carbohydrate compounds that      make up most of the body tissue of growing plants.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly, water also enables plant roots to obtain      nutrients that are beyond their physical reach. At varying      depths below our feet lies the water table. Above that is      soil containing minute, air-filled vestibules. When enough      moisture surrounds each soil particle to create a      continuous film from roots to water table, plants can, by      capillary action, draw water and thus food from places far      beneath their roots. (When this happens, the soil is said      to have reached field capacity.)    </p>    <p>      If, on hot summer days, the crops use more water than is      replaced, dry air spaces are created within the soil, and      the bridge to the water table is broken. Conversely, if a      real downpour hits and the air spaces become flooded to the      point of <em>excluding oxy</em> gen altogether, plants can      literally drown-because roots must have air      available, as well as water.    </p>    <p>      Whether or not <em>your</em> garden soil will retain water      well without becoming oversaturated is determined, for the      most part, by its structure. But don't feel that you must      live with the type of soil that's currently in your plot.      The great equalizer, compost, can help improve any ground      that has trouble properly absorbing <em>or</em> retaining      water.    </p>    <p>      Take sandy soils, for instance. They often have large      spaces between their particles that allow for excellent      drainage-if there is existing moisture in the soil.      If, however, as might be the case in an extremely sandy      soil, those spaces are completely filled with air, they can      actually become a <em>barrier</em> to water penetration.      Rain will be able to penetrate no deeper than the first few      inches, so even though the garden has gotten a good      soaking, deeper levels will remain bone-dry. When that      happens, plant roots tend to seek out only the upper few      inches of soil and will thus be quite susceptible to heat      and moisture loss.    </p>    <p>      Compost added to such a sandy soil will act as a      moisture-retaining wick. It should be incorporated      deeply-say, six to eight inches-so it will also      help attract roots downward.    </p>    <p>      Silty soil acts in much the same way. Its powdery,      flourlike texture can let water slip right through . . .      just as the soil itself would sift through your open      fingers. In the process, that water will quickly leach      nutrients from your plants. Here again, compost will give      your plot a better waterretaining capacity.    </p>    <p>      Clay soils have another problem: They have so few air      spaces that they're too <em>easily flooded</em> by water. A      sticky, slimy, wet clay soil can easily drown roots. The      addition of as much organic matter as possible is a def      inite must in order to lighten the soil to allow plant      roots more room to breathe. At the Eco-Village, we turn in      at least an inch of compost (and preferably more) before      planting any crop in our clay-heavy beds.    </p>    <p>      Turning under green manure (or cover) crops is often      another good way to add more humus to the soil. Our own      clay plot, however, doesn't have sufficient belowground air      to stimulate the needed decomposition of turned-under      crops, so we actually cut down most of the green matter and      compost it before working it in.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, adding <em>sand</em> to clayey <em>soil      is not</em> supposed to help its texture-the clay      allegedly "swallows" it up! As an old gardening maxim puts      it: Put clay in sand, money in the hand; put sand in clay,      throw money away. But when we finally tested this adage      last summer by working about an inch of sharp creek sand      into a few beds along with their compost allotment, the      sand did make a noticeable improvement in both texture and      drainage.    </p>    <h3>      When to Water    </h3>    <p>      Early mornings and evenings are almost magical times in      every garden. The low rays of the sun impart a certain aura      to leaves and fruit that's lacking in the harsh light and      heat of midday. And, as chance would have it, those are      also the best times of day to water.    </p>    <p>      Here at the Eco-Village, we water our established beds a      few hours before dusk, when the day's work is behind us and      the tranquillity of early evening is descending. The soil,      heated throughout the day, will warm the water as it      percolates downward, making the liquid less chilling (and      stressful) to the plants. Furthermore, watering in the      early evening allows time for the foliage to dry before      nightfall-preventing the sustained dampness that      favors the spread of fungi and mildews. In addition, plants      do much of their actual growing at night (employing the      stored products of photosynthesis), so they can well use a      late-day boost to their aqueous reserves. And evening is      generally a time of reduced wind and cooler      temperatures-so water added then will be less likely      to evaporate (an important conservation consideration).    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you find that you spend most of your time in      the garden during morning hours, you can water then      instead. While doing so may not provide quite as many      advantages as does early-evening watering, at least it      avoids the hazards of adding water in the heat of the day      (which can seriously stress plants) or at nightfall (which      encourages disease). It also provides the earth with a      deep, long drink early on that can help bring your plants      through the coming hot afternoon.    </p>    <p>      Do remember one thing, though: It's never a good idea to      work in your garden when the plants are wet (whether from      rainfall or overhead watering). You can easily damage crops      at such a time or-worse-spread disease.      (Carrots, tomatoes, beans, and squash are especially      vulnerable to handspread disease.)    </p>    <h3>      How Often and How Much    </h3>    <p>      Just as you may choose between two generally preferred      times to water, there are also two schools of thought on      how <em>often</em> to water. <em>Daily light</em> watering      regularly replenishes the water that growth and evaporation      use up. This way, the soil's water "arteries" remain intact      and reach deep into the ground. And <em>occasional      deep</em> watering accomplishes the same goal by      periodically drenching the soil thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      Choose whichever technique you prefer-just DON'T go      with <em>occasional light</em> watering. Such half hearted      efforts will keep only the top inch or two of soil moist .      . . coaxing roots to grow only near the surface; where they      can readily dry out.    </p>    <p>      To make sure you're watering enough-whether you go      for the daily-light or the occasional-deep method-get      a trowel, a soil tube, or an auger, and after you've      watered, dig down about a foot to see just how deep your      added moisture is penetrating. This is a very important      learning step. With time, you'll develop a feel for how to      keep the soil at its optimum saturation level. But until      you gain such expertise, digging to see what's really      happening underground is the way to go (and learn).    </p>    <p>      The first time or two you check, you may well discover that      you've been watering too shallowly. Many people make that      mistake, failing to realize that it can take three-quarters      of an hour to <em>fully</em> water one 10' X 10' plot!      Indeed, the average garden needs about one inch of rain or      irrigation per week . . . which figures out to about 62      gallons per 100 square feet. If you provide that much in      one weekly watering, it should soak the ground to a depth      of about one foot. (Dig and see!)    </p>    <p>      Of course, most times, natural rainfall will provide some      of that moisture, and you'll only have to make up the      difference. You can estimate the amount of natural      precipitation you've received by following your local      weather reports, by putting a large can in the garden and      measuring how deep the water in it is after each rain,      or-if you like precision-by making your own      rain gauge from a funnel and cylindrical tube. For the last      method, use a funnel with steep sides, and set it where      it's not exposed to ground splashings or heavy winds (about      a foot off the ground is good). You can also add a thin      film of oil to the cylinder to reduce evaporation losses.      To determine the number of inches of rainwater in the      cylinder that will equal one inch of rainfall, divide the      squared radius of the funnel by the squared radius of the      cylinder. Thus, if your funnel has a three-inch radius and      your collecting tube a one-inch radius, every nine (3 3 = 1      2 ) inches of water collected in the cylinder will equal      one inch of rainfall.    </p>    <p>      What about droopy leaves? Won't they tell you that you need      to water? Well, not <em>necessarily.</em> Plants often wilt      some on a hot summer day as a way of shutting down their      systems to <em>conserve</em> moisture. If you water at that      time, you can shock the flowers and vegetables and cause      more harm than good. (In fact, if you overhead-water on      such occasions, the plants may actually <em>lose</em>      moisture; the leaves will give up internal liquid to try to      balance the perceived atmospheric humidity and end up worse      off.)    </p>    <p>      Instead, look for signs of wilting during morning and      evening hours. If the leaves are drooping then, it's almost      a sure sign that your plants need water-and fast!      (One exception: Plants can also wilt if their roots are so      wet that they're flooded. A quick trowel-in-the-dirt will      determine the true cause if you have any doubts.) Remember,      though, that some waxy-leaved plants, such as cabbage,      onions, and garlic, don't show water stress as clearly as      others. On the other hand, peas, celery, spinach, and      lettuce are very susceptible to drought conditions and will      let you know in no uncertain terms!    </p>    <h3>      Tools    </h3>    <p>      A quality garden hose is the heart of any watering system.      A hose that will resist its inborn urge to kink and cut off      flow is all but priceless. So don't skimp on this      purchase-you'll never regret it. Standard diameters      are 1/2", 5/8", and 3/4". The larger the diameter, of      course, the greater the flow. (By the way, if you garden      with raised beds, you can set rebar posts-with bamboo      or PVC collars-at the corners of your growing areas .      . . and the posts will conveniently steer your hose      <em>around</em> the beds!)    </p>    <p>      A watering wand is a hose attachment that consists of along      tube with a rose nozzle at the end. It's kind to your back,      allowing you to stand upright while gently but thoroughly      soaking the soil at ground level. The wand is just the      thing for ground-watering melons, squashes, tomatoes, and      other plants susceptible to leaf molds and fungi. It's also      an efficient water user, since it places the liquid right      where you want it, rather than spraying it all through the      air and garden. We use ours frequently.    </p>    <p>      There are other common hose attachments for hand-held      watering, including the fireman-type nozzle, the spray gun,      and fan sprayers. All of these can be useful, but you do      have to stand there and hold them . . . which takes time      and increases the likelihood that you may skimp on      watering. To make your operation a bit more automated, use      a rotary or oscillating sprinkler. (The latter is generally      easier to use, since most of us lay out our gardens in      rectangularnot circular-patterns.) Sprinklers won't ap ply      water entirely evenly, however, and they need to be moved      periodically to prevent spot-flooding and runoff problems.      (You can buy automatic timers to shut them off after      specified periods.) A good source for sprinklers and other      hose attachments is Smith & Hawken, 25 Corte Madera,      Mill Valley, CA 94941.    </p>    <p>      Sprinklers have other drawbacks. They waste a lot of water,      both by evaporative loss and by wetting pathways-and      weeds-as much as crops. They can increase salt      buildup in your soil or on your plants (do your crops'      leaves have a powdery residue on them or a burned-edge      look?). And they wet the leaves of your disease-susceptible      crops.    </p>    <p>      The most water-efficient, automated system around is drip      irrigation-invented when an Israeli engineer by the      name of Symcha Blass spotted the beneficial effects of a      leaky spigot on the growth of a nearby tree. Drip      irrigation systems today come in two types: plastic hoses      with small valves-called emitters-spaced every      couple of feet, and microporous plastic pipes that weep      liquid along their entire length. Both systems use from      one-third to one-half less water than do overhead watering      methods . . . put the liquid right at your crops' roots . .      . and help increase yields by reducing the stress of      extreme fluctuations in moisture levels. Indeed, tests at      Ohio State University have shown that peppers and      cantaloupes grown with drip irrigation and black plastic      mulch produced more than twice the yield of those grown      without those two aids.    </p>    <p>      Drip systems do have some possible drawbacks. Their      openings can clog (to avoid that, put an appropriate filter      in your waterline). They can start to break down after      prolonged exposure to sunlight (that won't happen if you      keep the line just underground). And they must be moved      whenever you're going to do any serious cultivation.    </p>    <p>      Their biggest disadvantage, at least for people with larger      gardens, is cost . . . around $15 to $30 per hundred feet      of tubing. Perhaps the best way to deal with that      consideration is to buy a small "starter" drip system and      try it out for a season so you can evaluate its      effectiveness. Indeed, we intend to assess the merits of a      number of such systems this summer at the Eco-Village.      We'll tell you what we find out! <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: And we      did! Our article "Ooze Who</em> <em>in Drip      Irrigation"-just last issue-compared</em>      <em>six beginning drip kits.]</em>    </p>    <h3>      Water Conservation    </h3>    <p>      Many times, <em>conserving</em> water will be as important      as getting some to your crops. Particularly during July or      August dry spells, you'll want to make sure your garden      <em>uses</em> and <em>loses</em> as little water as      possible.    </p>    <p>      In a row garden, one of the easiest ways to cut water      demand is to plant three to five rows close together and      thereby reduce wasted (and watered) pathway space. Of      course, gardening in raised beds will save even more space.      Since such beds incorporate a greater depth of loosened      soil, they also absorb water better than row plantings do.      In addition, raised-bed gardening frequently incorporates      the art of spacing plants so that their mature leaves just      touch-thus creating a "living mulch" that further      blocks evaporation and conserves moisture.    </p>    <p>      Combine raised beds, living mulch, <em>and</em>      double-digging (to loosen the soil as deep as possible),      and you'll have a highly efficient water-conserving garden:      John Jeavons' Ecology Action group in Willitts, California,      has obtained excellent yields of vegetables using these      biodynamic/French intensive techniques and      <em>one-eighth</em> the water of conventional gardening!    </p>    <p>      While you obviously want to establish your garden away from      the drip line of trees (their roots practically      <em>inhale</em> water), those large plants do have their      place as windbreaks. Much more water is lost to evaporation      from wind than most of us realize. So you'd do well to      utilize any available trees, houses, hedges, or fences to      slow down the drying effects of hot summer breezes.    </p>    <p>      Mulching with dry materials such as hay, straw, wood chips,      or even black-and-white newspaper pages most definitely      helps protect bare soil from evaporative water loss. Keep      in mind, though, that you shouldn't mulch too early in the      growing year, or the covering will retard the warming of      your soil. Also, carbon-laden mulches do tie up nitrogen      while they're decomposing, so you should be sure that      heavily mulched soil has ample nitrogen. (Fish emulsion,      blood meal, cottonseed meal, and well-aged manure are some      good nitrogen supplements.)    </p>    <h3>      The Fundamental Point    </h3>        <p>      Finally, always remember that while expensive irrigation      systems or conservation strategies <em>will</em> help you      save water, the most significant way to conserve moisture      is to make soil improvement your top priority. A humus-rich      soil-created by using lots of compost and cover      crops-will hold the water it gets while still      allowing for aeration. Indeed, the soil should be our first      concern in all aspects of farming and gardening, because      nurturing the diverse life it sustains is the strongest      step we can take toward growing healthy plants.    </p>    <h3>      A Few Water-Saving Tricks    </h3>    <p>      There are plenty of small-scale steps you can take to make      efficient use of garden water. Here are four no-cost tricks      you might try:    </p>    <p>      1. Don't stake plants. Let your tomatoes, beans, and other      climbers sprawl (on clean, dry mulch), or else grow bush      varieties. By doing so, you'll expose less leaf area to the      drying effects of sun and wind.    </p>    <p>      2. Grow some vegetables in partly shaded areas. Lettuce,      parsley, peas, cabbages, and broccoli-among      others-can do quite well on just five hours of direct      summer sunlight a day. Fine netting shades crops well.    </p>    <p>      3. Punch small holes in the bottoms of large cans or      plastic milk jugs, set the containers next to thirsty      plants, and then fill them with water.    </p>    <p>      4. Hill up the sides of raised beds to create basins that      will trap and hold as much rainwater as possible.    </p>
