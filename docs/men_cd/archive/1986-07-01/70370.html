            		<p>      From Mother No. 95    </p>        <p>      Among both hunters and amateur naturalists, the squirrels      (family Sciuridae) make up one of the most popular groups      of wild creatures on this continent. These little animals      are highly adaptable, and most species have proven able to      survive, and even thrive, in areas where human destruction      of habitat has long since eliminated less opportunistic      mammals. They can be seen dancing limb to limb in city      parks and on wilderness hillsides from coast to coast,      and-being a very diverse bunch-include not only      the <em>tree</em> squirrels, but also such seemingly      dissimilar animals as chipmunks, woodchucks (or      groundhogs), flying squirrels, prairie dogs, marmots, and      ground squirrels.    </p>    <p>      Still, to most of us, <em>squirrel</em> means one of the      bushy-tailed tree dwellers. (In fact, the family name      translates as "shade tail.") These are the squirrels most      commonly admired by students of nature and most often      transformed into tasty meals by hunters.    </p>    <p>      Whether your chosen activity is observation or pursuit,      your success and satisfaction will be increased if you take      the time to learn about your quarry. So, to add to the fun      you'll find in squirrel watching <em>or</em> hunting, we've      prepared the following guide to the more common tree      squirrels of North America.    </p>
