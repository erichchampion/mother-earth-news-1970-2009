                <p>      SEASONS OF THE GARDEN    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      BY Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>    <p>      SHELTER FROM THE WIND CAN LEAD to big improvements in      garden yields and quality. And not just for row crops in      the Great Plains-your own back-yard plot can benefit from      properly designed windbreaks. Some crops that produce      better when out of the breeze include strawberries (earlier      ripening and higher yields), raspberries (higher yields due      to production of more canes), watermelons (improved fruit      quality because of less wind whipping, sand abrasion and      leaf drying), tomatoes (increased early yield      due-apparently-to higher temperatures), potatoes (earlier      maturing), snap beans and okra.    </p>    <p>      For a back-yard garden, the most important effect of a good      windbreak is an enhanced microclimate, with increased      humidity and temperature. Here are some design guidelines      from experts at the first International Symposium on      Windbreak Technology:    </p>    <p>      1. Living windbreaks (trees, shrubs or both) are      inexpensive to plant and maintain but don't give full      protection for at least a few years. Constructed windbreaks      offer "instant" protection-but at a higher price.    </p>    <p>      2. Orient windbreaks at right angles to the prevailing wind      direction(s) or as close to that as possible. Plantings      along west and north property lines are common (but beware      of blocking cool summer breezes). Avoid plantings on the      south side-you don't want to shade the garden. A windbreak      should be at least as long as the garden it's protecting.      And don't put a windbreak on the top of a ridge; it may      increase leeward turbulence. Put it a little downhill on      the windward slope.    </p>    <p>      3. Protection distance is proportional to windbreak height.      Typically, crop yields and quality are most improved at      distances between three and six times the barrier's height.      However, crops close to a living windbreak (less than its      height away) are likely to have <em>reduced</em> yields,      due to competition for water, nutrients and light.    </p>    <p>      4.Moderately dense (50% to 80%) windbreaks work best.      (Low-density ones don't slow the wind enough; high-density      ones create excess leeward turbulence.) Single-row living      windbreaks are adequate but are susceptible to gapping when      individual plants die. Consult your local Soil Conservation      Service for specific species suggestions (columnar-form      trees generally work well). Recommended spacings range from      five to eight feet for shrubs and small trees and from six      to 21 feet for larger trees, with the narrower spacings      more appropriate for single-row plantings and the wider      spacings for multi-row barriers.    </p>    <h3>Research Briefs</h3>    <p>      <strong>Killer mosses?</strong> A scientist with the      National Center for Atmospheric Research has discovered      that mosses can kill trees by generating organic acids that      make toxic soil aluminum more available to the trees'      roots. Acid rain appears to aid growth of the tree-killing      mosses.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Are praying mantises really "good guys"?</strong>      Probably not, according to some biocontrol experts. After      all, while mantises devour many pest insects, they're just      as happy to chow down on beneficial ones. Another drawback      to importing their egg cases is you won't get many of what      you worked (or paid) for: The little prayers have a high      mortality rate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ahhh, ions!</strong> Those desk-top air ionizers      may or may not promote human health-but they definitely      help some plants. Rumanian researchers report that tomato      seedlings exposed to ionized air grow taller and have      larger stems and more leaves than un-ioned ones.      <strong>Shine on, harvest grapes</strong> . Korean      scientists report that grapevines mulched with silver      reflective film grow faster and produce more highly colored      grapes (with higher concentrations of soluble solids) that      ripen earlier than unmulched vines.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Really worn-out soil!</strong> Agronomists recently      examined a New Mexico site that was cultivated by Native      Americans between A.D. 1000 and 1050, then abandoned. After      almost 1,000 years the cultivated soil was <em>still</em>      compacted, low in organic matter and plant nutrients      (especially nitrogen) and highly erodible. So it really is      true: You <em>can</em> wear out soil for a millennium.      Please be good to your great-great- greatgrandchildren's      soil.    </p>    <h3>Gleanings</h3>    <p>      The Gardenview computer program (for IBM compatibles with      EGA or VGA; from Mindsun, R.D. 2, Box 710, Andover, NJ      07821) shows garden landscapes in up to 136 colors (from      almost any perspective) through the seasons, with      accurately changing color patterns.... <em>Speedy</em>      soil-testing by mail is offered by Freedom Soil Lab, P.O.
