    <p>
                    <p>      Since offering a piece of land for sale, I've received      scores of letters from sincere, good people who want to      live simple, natural lives in the seclusion and beauty of a      wild forest area. I agree with these folks' motives, and      wish them all possible luck. . . but the tone of their      correspondence reveals so much unrealistic wishful thinking      that I doubt their chance of success.    </p>    <p>      For that reason, I would like to offer some facts for all      potential homesteaders to consider before they actually buy      property and try to make a go of rural living. Although      what I have to suggest relates specifically to the Ozarks      of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, I think most of      it is relevant to any genuine "deep country" area.    </p>    <p>      The Ozarks is (or are) a beautiful wild region of several      hundred square miles . . . mainly a land of low rolling      hills covered with oaks and other types of trees. Summers      are hot, winters are mild and short, and spring and fall      are wonderful. Relatively few people live in the district.      Towns are small and far apart, farms tend to be limited in      cultivated area, and the majority of land holdings are just      virgin forest, left idle and untouched for the most part.      This is, in fact, one of the last sections of real      "country" left in the U.S.    </p>    <p>      If you have a well-established source of income apart from      the Ozarks (and are so constituted that you can thrive on      solitude or the company of interesting guests from      "outside"), you can live among our hills in peace and      beauty . . . as close to nature as anyone could wish. But      if you must rely on making money within the area-by      selling craft items or garden produce, or by working full      or part time-it's extremely unlikely that you'll make      a go of homesteading in this or any other genuine "deep      country" location. The advantages of suburbia simply don't      coexist with true wilderness. In fact, it's their absence      that gives such a region its character.    </p>    <p>      In most cases it's a myth that a person can settle in the      depths of the country and maintain himself there. . .      unless he or she is willing to devote him or her self to      continual hard work, with little time to enjoy life or      pursue whatever mental and cultural pleasures he or she      favors. Only the rich can lead full, beautiful lives in a      really wild area. Most others are enslaved to endless      drudgery and penny-pinching. Think hard and realistically      before you make the leap.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, if you have children and genuinely love them,      don't cripple their minds by subjecting them to the low      level of "education" that prevails in such parts. The      public schools naturally reflect the attitudes of the local      voters . . . who are for the most part ignorant, want to      stay that way, and have no use for ideas brought in from      "outside" by upstart city folk. (Incidentally, how you look      has little effect on your acceptance. If you dress well,      you're a city dude and therefore suspect. If you have long      hair and want to live simply, you're a hippie and even less      welcome.)    </p>    <p>      Since few progressive people are moving into the portion of      the Ozarks I'm referring to, alternative schools are almost      non-existent and are not likely to be established because      of lack of interest. Do you want your children to be      decently taught, and to come under the influence of other      youngsters at least no more ignorant and savage than they      are themselves? Then spare them the stunting effect of      deep-country residence, with its non-education and warping      social contacts.    </p>    <p>      Actually, it's quite possible that none of this information      will be of genuine value to you, because there's almost no      acreage available in the Ozarks (unless you want promoters'      "vacation properties" close to tourist attractions and the      like). Few of the present owners are interested in selling      off part of their land . . . and good places, with woods, a      meadow, and a reliable year-round spring and/or stream,      have seldom come on the market during the past several      years.    </p>    <p>      In the event that you do find what seems to be a real dream      property, go much farther than checking out the title and      other facts about the parcel itself. Look at the whole area      relative to schools and services, moneymaking      possibilities, and the availability of whatever supplies      you must have. Lacking both local earnings and a steady      income from elsewhere, you could very easily lose your land      and all the money, work, and love you've put into it.    </p>    <p>      If you're beguiled by the thought of cheap land and low      taxes, remember that such conditions result from lack of      conveniences, job or other income opportunities, good      educational facilities, and satisfactory social      experiences. And as soon as you find some or all of the      above, you're back in the high rent district with stiff      taxes, stifling building restrictions, soaring land costs,      noise, dirt, and pollution. You can't have it any other      way.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if the dream of living in unspoiled      country means enough to you that you're willing to do      whatever is required to make it come true, find your place      but stay in an area where you can make a living . . .      paying off the land and visiting it whenever possible. When      the homestead is paid for, and when you have several      thousand in the bank-far more than enough to buy all      the materials and equipment you must have, and to cover      your living expenses for at least two years-then move      to the property and give rural life your best try. Your      chances of success on the homestead will be immensely      better under such a plan. And if you <em>can't</em> make      it, at least the land is yours and won't be lost through      inability to meet the payments. You can still take another      try at farming later, or sell the acreage (perhaps at a      profit).    </p>    <p>      To try to buy land while living on it and attempting to      make money from local sources is begging for disaster. A      few have succeeded-just enough to lure the starryeyed      dreamers-but most don't. Be cautious about the whole      idea, for a costly and painful experience can result if you      ignore the realities of such a venture. Don't leap into      deep-country life (in the Ozarks or anywhere else) without      knowing the total range of facts as they relate to your      needs and abilities.    </p>
