                    <p>      <em>"Poppy George" Plitt graduated from college with a      degree in agriculture in 1932. During the years that      followed he made a good many friends and a name for himself      (as a gentleman, inventor, and executive) in the field of      bird and animal husbandry and care. At various points in      his career, Mr. Plitt served as Director of Nutritional      Research and Field Services for two of the East's larger      grain mills. He is also the originator of Pride of the      Valley Wild Bird Food and Kleen Kitty cat litter. Mr. Plitt      now raises and trains standardbred horses and keeps a wide      variety of other birds and animals on a New York farm.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Poppy George" is now sharing his experience by giving      MOTHER's readers down-to-earth advice on the care and      feeding of homestead livestock. Ouestions should be mailed      to Mr. George Plitt, Happiness Hills Farms, RD 3, Addison,      N. Y. 14801.</em>    </p>    <p>      QUESTION: My wife and I are buying some acreage in the      northern "neck" of Virginia and expect to move there      sometime this year. We like the area very much . . . except      for the ticks, which have bothered us a great deal on      several occasions. I seem to be allergic to their bites and      react to each one with weeks of severe itching. My Virginia      friends tell me they have a lot of tick problems with their      dogs and other animals. Do you know of any non-toxic      repellent for these pests, or any way to remove one after      it becomes attached (without causing its head to remain in      the skin)?    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: Ticks can be a royal pain in the neck (and in other      places too) for both animals and people. My experience with      repelling the creatures has given no consistent results . .      . but I <em>have</em> had fabulous luck with removing them      from animals and humans-myself included-by      means of a drop or two of oil of camphor applied directly      on each intruder with a medicine dropper. You'll find that      the oil kills the tick, which usually comes out intact      (head and all). Please <em>do not pull</em> off the pests      once they're attached, because the head breaks loose and      severe itching and infection often follow.    </p>    <p>      QUESTION: Poppy, I have a goat, a calf, and a cow . . .      and, since I'm without a fenced pasture, I must stake the      animals out to graze and tie them when they're inside my      "barn". The goat and calf chew the rope ties, break loose,      and get into trouble. Chains are so expensive that I just      can't afford them now. What solution can you suggest?    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: If you're feeding your stock baled hay fastened      with twine-not wire-ties, save the string . . .      or you may be able to get a supply from a local farmer with      a large operation. He'll probably be glad to give you the      ties gratis, since they're a headache to dispose of. Take 6      to 12 strands, attach them to a snap (with a swivel), and      braid them into a rope. You can make the rope as long as      you wish. Then fasten a piece of wire to the end opposite      the snap and use the metal to pull the cord through a      length of old rubber or plastic hose (half-inch or larger      in diameter). This makes a durable, long-lasting tie for      indoor or outdoor use. If you're handy, incidentally, you      can use the 12-strand braid to fabricate halters for      calves, cows, horses, or goats.    </p>        <p>      QUESTION: I have a few dairy goats and a cow. Must they be      fed different diets?    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: Cattle and dairy goats <em>can</em> thrive on      basically the same rations. For instance, both can handle      roughage feeds such as pasture, silage, hay, sugar beets,      and many other root crops (besides most garden refuse      that's free of chemical residues). Milk production,      however, does require a diet containing 12 to 14 percent      crude protein. Quality alfalfa hay is excellent for both      animals, and a good grain ration should be fed by the      following rule of thumb: one pound of grain for each three      pounds of milk produced. This allowance should be divided      between morning and evening feedings.    </p>       <h3>AROUND THE HOMESTEAD</h3>    <p>      Successful animal husbandry depends in part on a knowledge      of disease and its management. If you're on your toes, you      can spot sickness in its initial stages . . . when you have      the best chance of dealing with it successfully. In future      issues I intend to describe some simple signs that indicate      when livestock or poultry are going out of condition. Let's      start with the following note on illness in calves.    </p>    <p>      I recommend that you invest a dollar or two in a veterinary      thermometer and take the rectal temperature of any animal      that doesn't look "just right". Do this at the first      indication of ill health. I affix a short bit of string to      the glass eyelet at the top of the instrument and tie the      other end to a spring-type wooden clothespin. After      inserting the bulb, I clip the pin to a portion of the      patient's tail. This is a very useful addition in case of a      restless beast or one that expels the thermometer or knocks      it out of your hand.    </p>    <p>      A calf's normal temperature can and does vary from 100°      to 101° F. An excited youngster can give a reading of      102° to 102-1/2° F. In my experience, a temperature      over 103° means trouble. Pneumonia cases of long      duration may produce a lingering fever in the      102°-103° range. A drop below 99° usually      indicates that the animal is not responding to your      treatment and is going to leave you.    </p>    <p>      I use aspirin to get a sick calf's temperature down. An      alcohol sponge bath is also helpful, but the patient should      be rubbed briskly at the same time, covered promptly with a      blanket, and kept in a draft-free area if possible.    </p>
