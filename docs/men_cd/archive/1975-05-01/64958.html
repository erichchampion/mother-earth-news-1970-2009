                    <p>      My husband, Ross, and I have been collecting information on      companion planting for use in our own garden. During this      research, we've found many pointers in various works, but      no extensive, easy-to-use listing of each crop's      preferences . . . so we'd like to share with you the guide      we've drawn up for ourselves.    </p>    <p>      Our list was compiled while reading and taking notes on      Beatrice Trum Hunter's <em>Gardening Without Poisons</em>      (second edition 1972, Houghton Mifflin Company, $6.95 hard      cover, $1.25 paperback) . . . which we highly recommend for      further information. We've also used hints from other      sources, including articles in <em>Organic Gardening and      Farming</em> magazine, and have been greatly encouraged by      <em>The Organic Way to Plant Protection</em> from Rodale      Press.    </p>    <p>      You'll note that many of the companions cited in the list      are intended as pest repellents. It's true that healthy      plants, growing in fertile, humus-rich soil, are much less      attractive to insects than less sturdy specimens. All the      same, if you're just beginning to build up your land (as we      are), you don't have to stand by helplessly and watch your      crops devoured: You can beautify your garden with certain      flowers and herbs which tend to ward off intruders. Just be      sure to plant the companions early, so they'll be fairly      good-sized and maybe even blooming by the time the      vegetables sprout. If you're not fighting a particular      pest, you can simply choose a few favorites from the      "generally helpful" group to scatter in and around your      garden plot.    </p>    <p>      As a rule, it's advisable to separate vegetables that      attract the same harmful insects. (We've included some      warnings to this effect in the list.) There are cases,      though, where it's expedient to lure the pests away from a      main crop to feed on a "trap crop" nearby . . . and we've      noted a few such examples.    </p>    <p>      You'll also see that some pairings are recommended as      "mutually beneficial" and it's wise to arrange your      planting accordingly (by alternating rows of beans and      potatoes, for instance, and sprinkling radish seed among      the lettuce). Just what makes these relationships work      isn't known in some cases . . . but there's no doubt that      certain combinations have turned out well for many      experienced gardeners, and the fruits of their experiments      can help you make your plot a thriving, harmonious      community.    </p>
