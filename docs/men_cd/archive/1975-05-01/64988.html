    <p>
                       <p>      Land is land . . . or so it seems when you look out over      the countryside. Often, though, subsistence or      non-subsistence on a farm or rural commune depends on a      factor you can't see at all: the quality of a tract's      soils. There's a world of difference between gardens that      yield good crops willingly, without fertilizers, and those      that grow only poverty grass . . . between drainage fields      that can absorb human wastes and those that send them      bubbling back to the surface . . . between pleasant roads      and driveways and those that turn to chunky peanut butter      in the spring or after a heavy rain.    </p>    <p>      Drainage, acidity (which is closely related to fertility),      soil texture and structure, stoniness, slope, presence of      hardpan layers . . . all these characteristics      can-and should-determine how man uses the land.      <em>Looking</em> at a property reveals none of those      important features. But then, it doesn't have to.    </p>    <p>      Prospective buyers of acreage in rural areas are sometimes      pleasantly startled to discover that easily accessible      soils information exists for almost every piece of farmable      property in the U.S. For over 70 years the U.S. Soil      Conservation Service (SCS) has been measuring and mapping      such data, tract by tract, throughout the country. By the      end of 1972, 43 percent of the U.S. had been covered . . .      with most of the uncharted area being federal forest and      western rangelands.    </p>    <p>      Much of the information thus gathered has been published in      the form of county soil surveys. Each directory in this      series contains maps showing what soils are found on all      the land in a given county, and descriptions of every      type's unique characteristics. If such a guide is available      for the area that interests you, it can be obtained free      from the local office of the Soil Conservation Service      (look under "U.S. Government" in the telephone directory).    </p>    <p>      Let's take a hypothetical example to show how the survey      can help you size up rural property. Suppose you're looking      for a place of your own-with a woodlot and maybe a      pond-where you can do some subsistence farming: keep      a few animals, plant a garden, raise enough crops for      livestock feed and home use. You're driving around Tompkins      County, New York (you like the area) . . . and you have      with you a copy of the Tompkins County Soil Survey.    </p>    <p>      The survey's general soils map tells you that the best      agricultural lands are found in the northern part of the      county. These tracts are expensive, however, since they're      already in intensive use by large, highly mechanized      operations. So you're looking at some of the poorer      properties (they're cheaper, and you don't intend to run a      large modern farm anyhow). Still, there's "poor" acreage      and worse acreage . . . and you do want to be able to grow      <em>some</em> crops.    </p>        <p>      You're particularly interested in four farms (see Fig. 1).      Each is for sale at a price you can afford, and each has      some feature that especially appeals to you . . . an old      orchard, or the style of the farmhouse, or a stream running      through the property. But what about the soils?    </p>    <p>      Fig. 2 shows the same farms with the soils units drawn in      and labeled as they would be on the detailed maps in the      survey. You'll see, for example, that Farm No. 4 has a lot      of acreage marked VbB. The first two letters are a code for      the soil type's name . . . in this case, Volusia. The third      letter-which can range from A to F-refers to      the class of slopes found in the mapping unit. Those marked      "B" on Farm No. 4 are gentle inclines of 2 to 5 percent.      <em>(The code system formerly used on soils maps varied      among counties, but is now in the process of being made      uniform throughout the U.S. -MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Now, using the soil survey and the map in Fig. 2, you can      evaluate the soils on the four farms. Those of Property No.      1 are predominantly Bath (Ba) . . . and, says the survey,      very strongly acid, which means that fertility would be low      unless you limed the tract. Since the slopes are marked      "C", you know that plowing them will be tricky and you'll      have to protect against erosion.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, Bath soils are well drained. You can      plow them early in the season, and underground water on a      tract of Bath soils is readily available to crops grown in      the permeable earth. This feature also means at least      moderate suitability for septic tank systems. Most of the      dirt road running by the property is on ground of the same      type . . . and again, the good drainage should be      appreciated in the spring.    </p>        <p>      Some Lordstown (Ln) soils are also found on the tract,      but-since these are on D and E slopes-they're      too steep for tilling and should remain in forest.    </p>    <p>      Farm No. 2 has predominantly Mardin (Ma) soils. . . not      quite as acid as the Bath type, and therefore a little more      fertile. Also, since about half the land is on B slopes,      plowing on this property would be somewhat easier and      erosion less of a problem.    </p>    <p>      Mardin soils, however, are only moderately well drained and      are underlain by a <em>fragipan</em> . . . a hardpan layer      close to the surface that impedes downward drainage as      effectively as bedrock. Spring plowing would therefore be      delayed, and septic tanks-even with large filter      fields-would sometimes not function properly. The      road (also on Mardin soils) would most likely be gooey in      the spring or during wet weather.    </p>    <p>      Lordstown (Ln) soils predominate on Farm No. 3. Like those      of the Bath type, they are strongly acid . . . good for      blueberries and perhaps hay, but giving poor yields of row      crops.    </p>    <p>      Lordstown soils are well drained and have no fragipan, but      generally form in only thin layers over bedrock. This      impedes downward drainage and makes for stony fields.      Spring plowing would again be delayed, and some crops that      require the development of deep root systems could be      difficult to grow. The closeness of the surface to bedrock      also means that your sewage effluent wouldn't percolate      down very far and could contaminate ponds, springs, and      wells.    </p>    <p>      The soils of Farm No. 4 are mainly Volusia (Vb). These are      only slightly less acid than the Bath and Lordstown types      and would still require a lot of lime to produce decent      crop yields.    </p>    <p>      The slopes on this farm are marked as B . . . not bad. But      wait a minute! Volusia soils, says the survey, are filled      with stones-some large-and if you wanted to      work the land with old-fashioned equipment, you'd have to      be prepared for trouble.    </p>    <p>      Even more serious than stoniness, however, is the bad      drainage. Volusia soils have a strong fragipan . . . which      means that you wouldn't be able to plow until late in the      season because of waterlogged earth (and also that roads      and driveways would likely turn soft in wet weather).      During dry periods, the roots of plants will be unable to      penetrate the fragipan to get water . . . so drought can      also be a problem.    </p>    <p>      Well, then, which farm do you choose? The soils on all four      properties have some limitations. The Volusia and Lordstown      types on Nos. 3 and 4, however, are clearly poorer than the      Baths and Mardins on the other two tracts. Between these      two, my choice would be No. 1. Although the Mardin soils of      No. 2 are more fertile and on gentler slopes, the good      drainage of the Bath soils can simplify many aspects of      rural life: plowing, septic systems, and road maintenance.      Their acidity is high but can be corrected by liming, which      is much cheaper than tile-draining poorly drained land.    </p>    <p>      I hope I've convinced you by this time that a soil survey      can give you a great deal of valuable information about an      area or specific property you're considering (or about a      place you already own). But what if the particular handbook      you need is still unfinished? It's true that surveys have      not yet been published for some counties (such studies      often take 20 years and cost over a million dollars to      complete). Nevertheless, the data are on file in the local      SCS offices and elsewhere, and are available to the public.    </p>    <p>      If your county's survey is not yet in print, the Soil      Conservation Service officials will show you the      unpublished maps and aerial photos and will help you      interpret them. And if the area you're interested in hasn't      even been mapped in recent years, the same experts can      direct you to old charts containing information which is      usually still useful. (The essentials certainly haven't      changed significantly in the last 50 years. . . and there's      hardly a county in the U.S. for which no soils data exist.)    </p>    <p>      An SCS representative, however, can do more than merely      distribute maps and printed material: He can-and      will-talk to you. A soils scientist once told me that      specialists in his field so rarely encounter a person who      is aware of soil differences that they'll "talk the arm      off" anyone who does show an interest . . . and in my      experience this is true.    </p>    <p>      Soil conservationists have had extensive field experience      and innumerable contacts with farmers and other rural      landowners in their areas. Accordingly, they can provide      unique insights into what you can do with the land and      where you might attempt to do it. Very often, in fact,      they'll be familiar with a specific property that interests      you.    </p>    <p>      Another good man to speak to is your county agent (who can      be located by looking in the telephone directory under      County Offices, Cooperative Extension Association). These      officials also distribute soil surveys, and most of them      are intimately familiar with the limits which the various      local soil types impose on farming and rural living. If      conventional agriculture is ailing or dead in the area      you're investigating, the county agent can tell you why . .      . and he can probably advise you whether or not the same      reasons would likely defeat your own plans for the land.    </p>    <p>      Another source of soils information is the county planning      board. This body gets its data from the SCS, and-if      your contacts with the soil conservationist and the county      agent were fruitful-you won't have to make the      additional visit... not for the same purpose anyway.    </p>    <p>      You may, however, want to call on the county planning board      for various other information . . . on sewage and water      facilities, the location of school districts, building and      health regulations, taxes, and areas where future      development is likely to occur. That last point can be      important. When you choose your rural loophole out of      modern living, you want to be sure it's not in the path of      some superhighway the planning board has slated to be built      five years or so later.    </p>    <p>      In closing, I suppose I should admit that I myself didn't      practice what I now preach. When my wife and I bought our      rural propert-yan old farmhouse with six      acres-I knew nothing about the soils on the tract. We      took the place because we liked the house and the isolation      and the fruit trees. We had no intention of doing any      farming . . . and that was just as well, since I know now      that the land is unsuitable for the growing of all but a      few specialized crops.    </p>    <p>      We have some friends who are attempting a commune nearby,      and they also are largely prevented from farming by the      soils on their property. Both they and we live on roads      that drastically shorten the lifespan of the cars that try      to plow through the goo each spring. About all my septic      system is good for is to fertilize the raspberry bushes      that grow near it. (I haven't asked the commune folks how      well their outhouses work.)    </p>    <p>      The fact is that we each have our own idea of what we want      from the land and what we think we'll be able to do for the      earth in return. If I had it to do over, I'd still purchase      the place I live on: The old house and the isolation and      the fruit trees compensate for the road and the septic      system. My friends on the commune would still buy their      tract because the seclusion is adequate trade-off for the      limitations they have to cope with. But then, neither we      nor they are trying to make a living from the land. If we      were, the shortcomings of the soils on our acreage would      suddenly become harsh and immediate realities. For persons      who are trying to approach self-sufficiency, to ignore      soils differences in choosing rural property is to court      disaster.    </p>
