        7 1/2 hp might seem very small, but all units are not used al the time. The load is staggered between alternator and air compressor. The air compressor has an output of 3.5 cu. ft. per minute. It only runs about 20% of the time, leaving just the alternator for the engine to power the remaining 80%. The waste heat generated by this rig is ""free"", so to speak, since it represents no load on the engine. (The air compresor is an old York refrigeration compressor.)
