                    <p>      <strong>MERRIE OLDE ENGLAND AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO      BE</strong> and the gluttonous spread of "civilization" is      putting a definite damper on the traditional "country      squire" way of life. Fox hunters, for example, have had a      dastardly time keeping their traditional prey out of      freeways, residential areas, shopping centers, and      crop-planted agribiz land. As a result, a pack of fifty      baying foxhounds and a whole slew of galloping,      tally-ho-ing riders recently chased Andrew Baird-a      company executive executive turned modern-day substitute      "fox"-through the dwindling fields and forests near      London for a full three and a half hours. Has it really      come to this?    </p>    <p>      <strong>OUR ECONOMIC CAN OF WORMS IS A BOON TO SOME      BUSINESSES</strong> ... one of which is Ivan Rayworth Jr.'s      Worm .. Ranch in Torrance, California. Rayworth maintains a      breeding stock of no less than 24,300,000 of the squiggly      creatures, and says his sales are getting better as the      economy gets worse. Why? Because there are plenty of      unemployed folks with enough time to go fishing these days      . . . and lots more people are gardening-and using      worms to improve their soil-than ever before Hmmm . .      . could there be a market for the little rascals in your      area?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NEARLY NINE MILLION ACRES OF UNFARMED LAND</strong>      was indiscriminately plowed up last year by American      agribusiness . . . all, apparently, in the name of      "relieving" the world food shortage. The Soil Conservation      Service of the United States Department of Agriculture      estimates that less than half of the newly tilled acreage      is being farmed with adequate erosion controls, . and      that-as a result-60 million tons of topsoil      were irreversibly lost from virgin land in 1974.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"THOSE BLASTED WATER HYACINTHS"</strong> that      plague Southern States by clogging boatways and snagging      fishermen's favorite lures may prove to be one of the most      efficient water pollutant filters known. Studies show that      two and one-half acres of the rapid-growth plants can      remove considerable amounts of cadmium, nickel, carbolic      acid, nitrogen, and phosphate at relatively fast rate . . .      and when harvested, can be processed to produce 2.5 million      cubic feet of usable bio-gas.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE DIXIE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY IS SINKING FAST</strong>      according to a recent article in <em>The National      Fisherman.</em> Skyrocketing fuel costs-and inflation      in general-have put such a pinch on profits that      employers are unable to raise wages in line with the cost      of living. As a result, hundreds of workers are quitting      their jobs and signing up for a higher-paying occupation:      welfare    </p>    <p>      <strong>DEMANDS FOR WATER IN THE WEST</strong> are getting      out of hand as all kinds of energy-development schemes for      the area-coal liquefaction, nuclear power plants,      shale oil extraction, hydroelectric production, and a bevy      of other "solutions" to the energy crisis-are      "running dry" for lack of the quantities of H 2 0 required      to pull them off. As a result, private corporations,      agribusiness concerns, and the Western States themselves      are madly scrambling for water rights, devising intricate      plots for diverting rivers from one area to another, and      talking of "modifying" the weather to bring more      precipitation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION?</strong> It's a landmark      year, folks: 1975 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of      this country's credit card industry. Yep. Way back in 1950,      Diner's Club-the original plastic pass to instant      consumption-signed up its first 200 members. Today, more      than 65 million credit cards are in use. Should we sing      happy birthday, or have a moment of silence?    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUY THOSE CANNING SUPPLIES NOW, FOLKS</strong> . .      . from all indications, manufacturers of jars, caps, and      lids won't be ate . to keep up with demand again this      summer. Sales in the industry have doubled, tripled, and      even quadrupled over the past <em>four</em> years . . , but      raw materials shortages-coupled with rising costs and      an uncertain economy-have apparently hampered efforts      efforts to keep productivity in line with the skyrocketing      demand.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UNDERSEA STORAGE OF SURPLUS GRAIN AND FISH</strong>      could make a significant dent in the world food shortage,      according study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration. The report suggests that fish-which      keep well in the presence of high pressure and low      temperature-could be stored underwater in areas close      to where they're caught, and that wheat and barley and the      like could be submerged in shallow lakes for protection. At      present, rodent and bird damage causes a 30 to 50% loss of      the total United States grain harvest... and over half of      all caught fish are of marginal quality by the time they      reach shore.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A GIANT LEAP FOR . . . LITTER?</strong> Evel      Knievel' Knievel's Snake River Canyan jump and the mobs of      people that attended the one-day event left nearly 100,000      aluminum pop-top cans behind.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EVEN IF YOU CAN'T BREATHE THE AIR</strong> in a few      more years, you'll be able to remove your gas masks, peer      through the smog, and see Alden M. Townsend's      pollution-resistant red maples swaying merrily in the      thermally disturbed breeze. Townsend-a botanical      geneticist for the ARS Shade Tree and Ornamental Plant      Laboratory-has apparently accepted grimy air as a      foregone conclusion, and is now busily working to develop a      breed of trees that can survive in such an atmosphere.      Let's see: You put the cart in front, and then the horse .      . . and . . .    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE 1975 MOUNT WASHINGTON ALTERNATIVE VEHICLE      REGATTA</strong> begins at noon on Sunday, June 15 and      concludes Friday evening, June 20th. The event-as      much a get-together as a contest-is centered around      performance evaluations (not speed) of alternative vehicles      climbing and descending the famed Mt. Washington Auto Road      in New Hampshire's White Mountain National Forest. If you'd      like to enter your non-polluting, motor-driven vehicle,      write Mt. Washington Trophy, P.O. Box 634, South Windsor,      Conn. 06075 or call (203) 289-6852 for more information.    </p>
