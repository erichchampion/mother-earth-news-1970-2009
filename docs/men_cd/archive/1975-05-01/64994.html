                          <div class="sidebar"><h3>HARRY HILL</h3>    <p>      First of all, let me introduce myself: I'm currently      employed as an instructor at Western Nebraska Technical      College in Sidney, Nebraska, where I teach courses in      industrial welding and a class in farm welding for local      farmers and ranchers. Prior to my present job, I worked six      years as a welder and welding technician. I'm also a member      of the American Welding Society I think, therefore, that      I'm qualified to comment on two articles in MOTHER NO. 31:      ."Homestead Welding" by John Wells -and "How to Make Money      With a Welding Route" by Henry L. Far r.    </p>    <p>      I was glad to note the two authors' enthusiasm for their      subject . . . but, while the articles gave some useful      information, they also contained errors which could be      dangerous (or at least make the job more difficult than it      need be).    </p>    <p>      Although Mr. Farr does an excellent job of pointing out the      need for welding repair services and the business potential      for qualified persons, he apparently lacks a thorough      knowledge of the trade. (He puts his foot in his mouth, for      instance, whey; he calls brazing rod "copper rod".) He also      tells of cutting a hot water tank an the wrong direction,      and of misunderstanding other simple directions. A person      who welds for income ought to know his work well enough not      to make such basic mistake at the expense of the public.    </p>    <p>      As an instructor, I must disagree with the same author's      remarks on the process of learning to weld. For example, he      says, "It's necessary to study and practice for many hours      to get the right flames . . . . " In two years of teaching      I haven't se;,: anyone take more than a few minutes to do      so. It's <em>after</em> you get the right flame that the      difficulty and hard work begin.    </p>    <p>      Elsewhere, Mr. Farr calls welding "easy" and "quickly      learned'". The truth is that this craft-like many      others-is easy to do but hard to do well.    </p>    <p>      Welding is beautiful work. It takes concentration, manual      dexterity, rhythm, and understanding. The laws of the      universe that govern the behavior of metal are written in a      skilled workman's mind and body, so that he instinctively      does the right thing at the right instant.    </p>    <p>      A welder worthy of the name is a person of integrity, who      bears in mind that poor work can result in loss of property      and life. Imagine the breaking of a band repair on a      boiler, trailer hitch, or moving piece of machinery! A good      weld shows real love and concern for one's fellow human      beings. This occupation can, in fact, be a way of giving      your energies to build a better world. Although its      techniques have been perfected as part of an industrial      society, there's no reason why they can't be a constructive      tool in a lifestyle based on agriculture.    </p>    <p>      We do need more welders-as Mr. Farr pointed      out-but they should be good craftsmen who have spent      a few years studying under. an experienced person before      going out on their w own. The best way I know to learn      welding as a trade is throws through one of our country's      many vocational schools . . . or, if you can't go that      route, in a shop where you can be trained on the job.    </p>    <p>      I must now comment on some of the statements in John Wells'      article. First, on pp. 39-40: " . . . the oxygen valve is      then pressed to produce a blast of gas which literally      blows away the molten metal." This is not how the cutting      process works. When steel is red hot, it oxidizes at a very      rapid rate. The precisely directed blast of oxygen from the      cutting torch "burns" the steel in its path, leaving a cut      that can be smoother and cleaner than one made by a saw.    </p>    <p>      On page 40: "Welding is carried out at various pressures      according to the work to be done. For steel 1/8" to 3/8"      thick usually run the acetylene to the hose at about 7 to      10 psi (pounds per square inch). The oxygen is held at      about 25 to sir psi, since an oxygen-acetylene ratio of      between three to one and five to one is the general rule."    </p>    <p>      This description confuses welding (a process of joining two      pieces of metal) and cutting, which are done with totally      different torches. In welding, the oxygen-acetylene ratio      with a neutral flame is one to one. In oxyacetylene      cutting, the ratio of consumption depends on the tip size      and the thickness of metal being cut and may vary from      three to one to ten to one,    </p>    <p>      In either technique, the pressure setting depends on the      size of the tip (the removable portion of the torch closest      to the flame) and on its manufacturer. To find the corrrect      tip size and pressure setting for a given job, consult the      instruction manual for your equipment. If you don't have      one, write the maker (such guides are usually sent free on      request).    </p>    <p>      In the next paragraph-after telling how to set the      pressure-the author says: "Then open the valves on      the gas containers until the regulators' tank pressure      gauges register 'medium'." This is not a recommended      procedure and could be very dangerous. The acetylene or      fuel container valve should be opened one-quarter to      one-half turn . . . so that if the hose breaks or any      emergency arises, the gas can be shut off with one quick      movement.    </p>    <p>      The oxygen container's valve is a double seating type and      should be opened all the way, for the following reason: The      pressure in a full cylinder of oxygen is 2,200 psi at      70° (as compared to about 1,600 psi in a shotgun barrel      at the moment of firing). If the tank's orifice is not      fully open, the force of the escaping gas can bend the      valve stem and ruin the valve.    </p>    <p>      In the last paragraph on page 40, Wells advises the reader      to open first the oxygen valve and then the acetylene valve      when lighting the torch. The standard and recommended      procedure is to open arid light the acetylene and then to      open the oxygen.    </p>    <p>      On page 41, concerning the operation of the cutting torch:      "The torch is best kept at an angle of about 60° to the      work, with the tip pointing in the direction <em>of</em>      travel." This method may be of help if you're using a tip      size too large for the metal being cut. With the proper tip      size, the torch is held at an angle of 90° to the work.    </p>    <p>      In general, the directions for arc welding are inaccurate      and too sketchy to learn from. I'll mention just a couple      of points with which I disagree. On page 41, in his      description of the safety helmet used in this process,      Wells says that the hood lens should be "at least a No.      12". Actually, the shade of the lens depends on the welder      and the type of job being done. It normally varies from No.      10 to No. 12, with No, 11 most common.    </p>    <p>      Also, the chart showing rod size and amperage setting is      misleading. If you try to use an electrode 3/16" or larger      on a home welding machine, you'll probably blow a lot of      fuses . . . because the large electrodes draw more amps      than most residences or farms are serviced for. The chart      also implies that large electrodes are needed to weld      thicker metal. This is not so. A 1/8" electrode can handle      almost any job that's likely to arise, although you may      have to make several passes.    </p>    <p>      Welding is, of course, too complex a subject to be more      than touched on in a magazine article. For MOTHER's readers      who would like to learn welding for their own purposes, I'd      recommend taking a night class at a local high school or      community college. If that's not possible, get books from      welding equipment manufacturers. Such works are less      expensive than those from publishing houses, and their      authors are generally more in touch with practical      applications of the craft.    </p>    <p>      One good source of study material is the James F. Lincoln      Arc Welding Foundation, P.O. Box 3035, Cleveland, Ohio      44117. This organization publishes <em>Arc Welding      Instructions for the Beginner</em> by H.A. Sosnin (a very      understandable book with explicit, clear instructions) and      <em>Arc Welding Lessons for School and Farm Shop</em> by      Harold L. Kugler (which contains direct applications to      farm use arid other hard-to-find information). Each of      these manuals costs $2.00.    </p>    <p>      The Union Carbide Corporation, Linde Division, 270 Park      Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017 publishes two excellent books on      oxyacetylene processes: <em>Oxy-Acetylene Welding, Brazing,      and Cutting for</em> the <em>Beginner ($2</em> .50) and      <em>The Oxy-Acetylene Hand</em> boo,k ($6.75). These prices      are for individual orders and include handling and shipping      costs.    </p>     <h3>PETER ROBINSON</h3>    <p>      I have some feedback on the article "Homestead Welding" in      MOTHER NO. 31.    </p>    <p>      [1] First, the author omitted a very important safety      consideration (and one that's riot obvious to the      inexperienced): It's imperative to wear eye protection when      chipping the slag off a weld. The slag is a glassy material      that can come flying off at high velocity, and is also very      hot for some time after its formation. Any splinter that      flew into the eye would cause permanent damage.    </p>    <p>      [2] The valves on the cylinders containing the oxygen and      acetylene are opened slowly and all the way.    </p>    <p>      [3] Mr. Wells describes the procedure for lighting an      injector-type torch, not tile more common equal pressure      torch. In the latter case one normally opens the acetylene      valve, lights the torch, and then opens and adjusts the      oxygen.    </p>    <p>      [4] A horizontal flat weld is also done with the electrode      pointing back toward the start of the work.    </p>    <p>      The above information is based on my own experience of 20      years of part-time welding, and was confirmed by two      friends, each with over 40 years' experience as a full-time      professional welder.    </p>    <p>      <em>(It's interesting to</em> note that these two      <em>feedbacks-in an effort to "set the record      straight"-disagree with</em> each other on a very important      point. <em>Which is it, fellows? Do you open the      acetylene</em> valve <em>all</em> the way as      <em>recommended by</em> Mr. <em>Robinson</em> or      <em>only</em> partway as stated <em>by Mr.      Hill?-MOTHER.)</em></p></div>
