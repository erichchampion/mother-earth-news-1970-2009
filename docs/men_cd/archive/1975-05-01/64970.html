                   <h2 id="subtitle">      SPECIAL<br />      MINI-DAIRY SECTION    </h2>        <p>      For most newcomers to the land-provided they're not      the very strictest of vegetarians-the homestead dream      includes at least one placidly grazing dairy animal. Just      <em>what</em> animal, though, is a matter of personal      preference. In the U.S., Canada, and most of Europe, the      usual options are cows and goats . . . and each has its      vigorous partisans. If you're not violently prejudiced one      way or the. other, it's best to make the choice rationally      on the basis of your own circumstances and the nature of      the beasts in question.    </p>    <p>      Cows, for instance, are basically grass eaters and require      good pasture in summer and plentiful hay through the      winter, with some grain as a supplement. If your homestead      is blessed with lush meadows, Bossy will thrive. On the      other hand, if what you have to offer is rough terrain and      brush-grown hillsides, a herd of goats will clamber and      browse happily on your place (and help control the      undergrowth while they feed). They can't produce milk on      twigs alone, though, and will need additional rations of      hay, vegetables, and grain.    </p>    <p>      There are many other pros and cons . . . mostly questions      of cost versus productivity. A good cow will require a      fairly large initial investment (in many areas, $300 and up      for an established milker) and will need more food and more      elaborate shelter than a goat . . . but she'll also produce      much larger quantities of milk (several gallons a day) and      her calves will be valuable regardless of sex (steers of      even the dairy breeds will provide large quantities of      high-quality protein for home use).    </p>    <p>      While a doe's production is much smaller than a      cow's-an average is two to three quarts daily over a      10-month season-always remember that you can keep      about five goats for the cost of one cow and that goats'      milk can often be tolerated by people who are allergic to      cows' milk. Nanny is also given to multiple births, which      means that your herd will increase quickly (and also that      you'll have to dispose of numerous male kids. . . not an      easy decision, since they're among the most charming of      young animals. Chevon, however, is good food if you can      bring yourself to do the slaughtering.)    </p>    <p>      Two more points to consider before you commit yourself to      any milch animal: [1] The price of a home milk supply is      getting out to the barn faithfully twice a day-come      hell, high water, childbirth, double pneumonia, or legal      holidays-to milk and otherwise tend your beasts. [2]      Robert Frost was right . . . good fences really do make      good neighbors. If you have stock, you're responsible for      controlling them. Goats are notorious escape artists and a      frisky heifer is none too easy to keep in the home pasture.    </p>    <p>      If you <em>do</em> make the commitment, there are several      good sources of information on goatkeeping . . . including      the following:    </p>    <p>      <em>Dairy Goat Journal</em> (monthly magazine), P.O. Box      1908, Scottsdale, Ariz. 85252 (one year subscription $5.00,      three-year $14.00)    </p>    <p>      <em>Aids to Goatkeeping</em> by Cori A. Leach (8th edition,      $10.00 from <em>Dairy Goat Journal</em> )    </p>    <p>      <em>Starting Right with Milk Goats</em> by Helen Walsh,      $3.00 from Garden Way Publishing, Charlotte, Vt. 05445 (or      from MOTHER'S Bookshelf)    </p>    <p>      American Dairy Goat Association, Spindale, N.C. 28160.      (There are also various regional dairy goat associations      and local goalkeepers' clubs through which you can meet      experienced persons from your own area. Important: Ask such      an individual to recommend a veterinarian who has a good      working knowledge of goats. Do this in advance,      <em>before</em> you need the vet's services.)    </p>    <p>      Advice on the care of a family cow is harder to come by,      since most dairy publications are oriented to the large      operation. One good, detailed description of homestead      cowkeeping and dairy management, however, is found in Carla      Emery's <em>Old Fashioned Recipe Book,</em> Kendrick, Idaho      83537 ($12.95 including postage). You might also send for      USDA Leaflet No. 536, <em>Keeping a</em> Cow, from the      Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,      Washington, D.C. 20402 (current price is available on      request). And then, of course, there's the excellent      article, "The One-Cow Family Meets the One-Family Cow", in      MOTHER NO. 15 and "The Miniature Dairy" section in MOTHER      NO. 2.    </p>    <p>      Finally, you'll find a good selection of animal husbandry      and dairy supplies-including specialized goat      items-in the catalog of American Supply House, P.O.      Box 1114, Columbia, Mo. 65201.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">    by J. Micheal Thompson    </h5>     <p>      The milk cow shifts around the calving stall and eyes us      with some exasperation. She'd just as soon we left. But we      stay standing at the other end of the barn where we won't      annoy her too much, smelling the good sweet smell of green      hay and healthy animals. Through the gloom we see that she      has dropped her calf, and we hurry forward to look at it.    </p>    <p>      There on the clean straw lies a wet little creature, weak      and spangled with tissue and blood. It lifts its head, its      ears back, and lets out a small blat. We can see that its      nose and mouth are clear, so we stand and watch. The cow      has turned to find out what in the world happened back      there, and-intensely interested-she stretches      her head out to the calf. Then she utters the peculiar soft      moo kept only for this occasion: the bovine equivalent of      an old woman's "Oh, isn't that sweet!" She reaches out her      long, rough tongue to begin the grooming which will warm      and strengthen her new baby.    </p>    <p>      "So what's the problem?" you say. "Let's all go back to      bed."    </p>    <p>      The problem is that that calf represents centuries of      severely selective breeding. For generations, man has bred      a highproduction milk cow to the son of a high-production      milk cow . . . and repeated that process until we now have      milk machines known as dairy cattle. And something happened      to the calves along the way: They lost the ability to      survive on their own.    </p>    <p>      While the beef calf can get on well outside with its      mother, the dairy calf is more prone to disease. . . and in      any case can't be left with its mother for more than a day.      She produces far more milk than the baby needs, and the      overfed youngster will soon be sick with scours (diarrhea).      Nevertheless, the little creature is a valuable animal and      worth the extra attention it requires.    </p>    <p>      My husband has the iodine dip ready and enters the calving      stall. The cow, who knows him well, lets him admire her new      baby. By this time the calf is trying to stand, with the      mother's tongue alternately helping it up and knocking it      down. My husband checks to be sure the newcomer's nose and      mouth are clear, raises the baby to its feet, discovers      that it's a heifer (female), covers the navel cord with      iodine dip to prevent infection, and heads the critter in      the direction of its first meal.    </p>    <p>      Ideally a calf should suck within fifteen minutes after      birth, but many healthy babies aren't ready for an hour or      an hour and a half. If the youngster hasn't fed in that      time, help it to the teat and squirt a little milk into its      mouth until it begins to nurse.    </p>    <p>      Occasionally a first-time heifer won't claim her offspring.      When this happens, sprinkle a little grain on the calf. The      cow should lick up the feed and then go ahead with the      normal grooming. If she refuses to do so, rub the calf      vigorously with an old turkish towel or a clean burlap bag.      Be energetic about it . . . this procedure dries and warms      the little animal and helps its circulation.    </p>    <p>      Once in a while, a new mother may refuse to let her calf      near her (some will even kick at their young). In that      case, put Ma in a stanchion and the baby in a clean, dry      calf stall. Milk the cow, put one quart of the warm fluid      in a nipple bottle and do the feeding yourself.      Congratulations! You have just become a mother.    </p>    <p>      If a fresh cow claims her calf you may leave them together      in the calving stall for one day, after which the youngster      must be put where it can't suck. (Dairymen separate the two      as soon as possible after birth and absolutely by the third      day.) The cow will be happiest if she can see her      offspring, but won't suffer if this arrangement isn't      possible. Some, in fact, are upset by the responsibilities      of motherhood and show relief when the baby disappears.      We've never seen a cow mourn, but we've always kept more      than one and it's possible that the herd instinct overcomes      the maternal urge.    </p>    <p>      For the first six milkings after the birth of her calf, a      cow yields a substance called colostrum instead of milk.      This highly nutritious food is rich in antibodies which      help the young animal fight off the many diseases and      infections to which it's prone. Now you know why it's so      important for the baby to have its first meal soon after      birth. Without colostrum, in fact, the calf won't survive.    </p>    <p>      In the past, excess colostrum was fed to chickens or pigs .      . . or just dumped. <em>(Or, in northern Europe, eaten      by</em> <em>humans. See MOTHER NO. 23.-MOTHER.)</em>      Today, dairymen are saving the surplus and feeding it until      it's gone.    </p>    <p>      Here's how to store colostrum: For the first three days      after a calf's birth, put one and a half quarts from each      of its mother's milkings-morning and      evening-into a clean pail, nipple bucket, or bottle      and feed the baby. All excess milk should be poured into a      clean milk can, a garbage pail with a tight-fitting cover,      or any container which can be kept sanitary. When the      collection has soured, it's referred to as "pickled      colostrum" and is the absolute best food for calves      available anywhere. Young animals started on it maintain      fine coats, are much less prone to pneumonia, are almost      free of simple scours, are vigorous, and grow well. This is      understandable, since colostrum is a completely natural      diet. (No food alone can prevent illness in newborn calves,      of course, if the babies are neglected.)    </p>    <p>      Begin to feed pickled colostrum when the new calf is three      days old. Stir the sour milk well and measure three cups of      the thick fluid into the same amount of hot water. Mix and      feed the warm ration to the calf twice a day. (Large      youngsters may be given up to two quarts at a time.) When      the colostrum begins to run out-or if you've bought a      calf to raise-you'll have to decide whether to finish      the animal on whole milk, skim milk, or commercial dry milk      replacer.    </p>    <p>      At about ten days of age the calf should be offered a      little dairy grain mix and green leafy hay. Put the feed in      a clean grain box and replenish it as the baby eats the      mixture. In fine, warm weather, calves as young as one week      can be put out on clean pasture where they'll soon be      nibbling a little grass (and thriving on the sun and fresh      air).    </p>    <p>      At one month of age, larger breed salves (Holstein and      Brown Swiss) should be getting four quarts of milk daily,      0.7 pounds of grain, and 0.2 pounds of hay. They may be      weaned at six weeks if they're doing well. Smaller calves,      such as Jerseys and Guernseys, need three quarts of milk a      day, 0.3 pounds of grain and 0.2 pounds of hay. They're fed      milk until seven or eight weeks of age and thrive on      <em>less</em> rather than more per feeding (never more than      a quart and a half at a time).    </p>    <p>      Sometime before weaning a calf you'll probably want to      teach it to drink from a bucket. This isn't difficult if      you remember that the critter has a natural tendency to      butt its mother's bag to make her milk flow more quickly.      It also has a natural tendency to butt the milk pail . . .      so hold tight, or you'll end up with a bucket hat.    </p>    <p>      Put the milk ration in a clean pail. Back the calf's rump      into a corner, straddle its back-facing      forward-and hold the animal firmly between your legs.      Grasp the milk bucket by the far rim with your left hand.      Put the middle finger of your right hand into the critter's      mouth (it won't bite) with your palm over its nose. When      the baby begins to suck hard, lower its mouth into the      liquid and-once it's taking the milk      well-slowly remove your finger.    </p>    <p>      Some calves learn the first time, others take a week or      more to get the hang of it. A youngster that declines to      drink won't be hurt by missing one feeding and will learn      more easily when hungry. Occasionally one will refuse to      suck your finger and will have to be fed with a nipple pail      or bottle for the duration. Whatever, every utensil used to      feed calves must be washed and sanitized after each use.    </p>    <p>      Until they're weaned, the animals should be tied or stalled      separately to prevent the spread of disease or infection.      This also facilitates feeding and prevents the young ones      from learning to suck one another.    </p>    <p>      Maybe you're thinking that this feeding business sounds      like a lot of trouble when you have a perfectly good cow      handy. So OK. In spite of what I've just said, some people      do let their calves nurse, with satisfactory results. I      never do so myself, however, because I can't tell how much      milk the young one is getting . . . but if you want to try,      the accepted procedure is to let the baby suck out one      quarter of the mother's supply and no more. Good luck.    </p>    <p>      Shelter is simpler than feeding, but just as important.      Calves must be kept dry and out of drafts. Although they      can stand a lot of cold, temperatures far below freezing      are hard for them to cope with because too much of their      energy must go to keeping warm. If you haven't enough      livestock to keep your barn comfortable, wall off a small      area where a few animals can keep each other warm . . . or      start to build your herd with small calves during the warm      months.    </p>    <p>      Then again, a satisfactory draft-free calf stall can be      made of two 4 X 8 sheets of plywood. Just build a 3' X 5'      bottomless box raised several inches on legs of scrap      lumber, and place enough bedding inside directly on the      barn floor to reach up to-and overlap-the lower      edges of the four plywood walls.    </p>    <p>      The best method of bedding, we've found, is to start with      an ample layer and let the material build up under the      calf. Fork out the manure daily and add clean straw or      whatever . . . and the baby will soon have a clean, warm,      well-drained bed up off the floor. When a calf is moved,      clean out and sanitize the stall before putting down fresh      bedding for the next one.    </p>    <p>      Simple preventive measures like those I've been describing      are the best medicine for your animals. Observe common      sanitary procedures in everyday handling, intensify those      procedures if disease breaks out in your barn, and you'll      be able to raise most of your calves. If any of our own      herd are really sick, though, we use antibiotics to help      them fight off the infection. It's worth the expense: A      healthy two-year-old springing heifer (one that's about to      calve) will sell for over $500 anywhere in Wisconsin today,      and a dairy bull will fill our freezer for a long time with      meat as good as or better than most we can buy. A dead      calf, on the other hand, is of no use to anyone.    </p>    <p>      If you give your baby too much milk, or if it gets loose      and nurses, it may develop simple scours (a foul-smelling,      pasty bowel discharge). Skip one of the calf's meals, then      resume feeding the baby half as much of the formula as it      received before it got sick. You can also dissolve      one-quarter cup of pure rennet in the milk-one-half      cup may be necessary in severe cases-or give the      youngster a dose of Pepto-Bismol or Kaopectate. When simple      scours is brought on by unclean utensils, drafts, etc.,      correct the cause and treat the condition as described . .      . but watch much more closely for signs of infection which      may require antibiotics. (Medicines and syringes are      available at farm supply stores everywhere and should be      kept on hand at all times when you're raising calves.)    </p>    <p>      A calf weakened by scours is apt to develop other      illnesses. When a scoury youngster stands with its head      slightly drooping, its ears back, its rump slightly tucked,      and its tail drawn under, that's a sick animal. Watch it      closely for signs of pneumonia: sneezing, coughing,      wheezing, difficult breathing and/or nasal discharge. If      any of these symptoms appear, immediately inject      antibiotics as per the directions on the bottle. Blood in      the discharge may mean bloody scours, a very serious      infectious disease which also requires antibiotic      treatment.    </p>    <p>      If you intend to sell your heifers or your milk, by all      means have female calves vaccinated for Bang's disease      between the fourth and eighth month of age. Many farmers      won't buy an animal unless it's protected against this      condition, which is transmitted to humans as undulant      fever.    </p>    <p>      When the vet comes by to vaccinate a new batch of babies,      we also have her castrate our bull calves. It's a quick,      painless, bloodless procedure when done with a crimper      (which destroys the semen channels without cutting). If      you're inclined to keep an uncastrated male, remember that      the vicious beasts of storyland weren't the beef bulls we      see so often. They were dairy bulls . . . and dairy bulls      are still by far the more dangerous (Jerseys being the      worst of all).    </p>    <p>      Once your male calf is a steer, however, you can keep him      safely while he grows into a source of excellent eating.      The only obvious difference of dairy cattle meat from that      of beef cattle is the color of the fat in the Channel      Island breeds. The jersey's fat is cream-colored rather      than white, and that of the Golden Guernsey is definitely      yellow. This in no way affects the flavor or the quality of      the meat.    </p>    <p>      Is raising a dairy calf worth all the trouble? Yes! And not      just for the future meat and/or milk it represents. A      healthy baby romping around a sweet, clean pasture is a      sight you won't soon forget. The sleek coat that glistens      in the sun, the clear eyes, the funloving, affectionate      nature are all part of the "extra dividends" you'll get in      return for the proper care of your newborn calf.    </p>
