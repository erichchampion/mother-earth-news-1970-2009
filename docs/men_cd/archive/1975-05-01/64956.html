                        <h5 id="byline">      by james b. dekorne    </h5>    <p>      Most of us who have returned to the land within the past      few years are products of the cities and suburbs. As such,      we've had little or no previous experience with the      everyday realities of homestead living.    </p>    <p>      The skills and know-how which were accepted as an      ordinary part of rural life a hundred years ago, therefore,      must-for the most part-be relearned today through      books or periodicals such as the one you're now reading.      Unfortunately, however, if one delves very deeply into just      about any subject he is likely to come across some      contradictions. There are, in other words, many more ways      than one to skin a cat . . . and, if my experience is any      indication, there must be at least a hundred ways to skin a      hog.    </p>    <p>      We bought an eight-week-old pig last April for $25.00 (the      going local price). At the time we were blissfully ignorant      of the many different opinions about proper hog culture . .      . which was probably to our advantage, since we managed to      raise our Shirley Pearl to a happy, healthy 250 pounds      without being confused with the "facts". It wasn't until I      began researching this article that I became fully aware of      the many schools of thought-most of which conflict      with each other-on raising pigs. Maybe you're aware      of these honest differences of opinion, maybe not. Still,      if you think you can stand yet <em>another</em> point of      view, I'd like to tell you of our experiences with      homestead pork production.    </p>    <p>      In MOTHER NO. 18, on page 70, Sarah Funk tells us, <em>"The      fact is that a lone hog doesn't grow well at all (he likes      to have company). "</em> This opinion is echoed, in even      stronger terms, by John Seymour in MOTHER NO. 29; " <em>I      will personally have no part in suggesting to anybody that      they should buy one [pig]. I have made the point that the      husbandman is a benevolent ruler and not a tyrant, and a      benevolent ruler does not keep anybody in solitary      confinement.</em> <em>"</em>    </p>    <p>      Had we been informed of this before we purchased Shirley      Pearl, we probably would have thought twice about the      project . . . since our finances at that time would not      support the expense of feeding two animals. As it was, we      were able to get a limited amount of highquality garbage      from a friend who runs a local restaurant. Even with this      and lots of greens from our garden, however, Shirley's diet      had to be supplemented with grain from the feedstore. (We      kept a fivegallon can of corn and barley on the stove      because cooking increased the mixture's volume and      palatability many times.) The cost of this      ration-almost $10.00 per hundred pounds-made us      painfully aware that one acre of land is not enough for      self-sufficiency if you expect to raise feed for your      livestock in addition to a regular garden. Two hogs would      have broken our budget in two, and we'd have been hard      pressed to preserve that much meat.    </p>    <p>      Anyhow, as it turned out, Shirley wasn't lonely (she lived      next door to the goats, and spent many an hour conversing      with them through the fence) . . . and she put on all the      weight we could have hoped for.    </p>    <p>      Now, when one is raising an animal for food, he is always      aware at the back of his mind that the day will come when      that creature must be slaughtered. This killing business      has always been a problem with me. At one point in my life,      I even became a vegetarian for that reason . . . but soon      had to admit that I had eaten meat all my life and that I      still liked it. This led me to accept the fact that plants      and animals live upon this earth in a harmonious      relationship, and that death and life are but two halves of      one reality which is the same for all living things.    </p>    <p>      Shirley was a friendly and intelligent creature, and all of      us became very much attached to her. We didn't attempt to      think of her as "the pig" or deny ourselves the pleasure of      her personality . . . which was every bit as unique as the      cats', the dog's, or the goats'. Many articles about      raising hogs recommend having the- killing and butchering      done by a professional slaughterhouse . . . but this, in      our opinion, is a cop-out. If one is going to eat meat, we      feel, he should take the responsibility of killing it      (which, to be sure, would probably lead to there being a      lot more vegetarians in the world). So, guided by this      philosophy, we did our own butchering and Shirley Pearl      died the way she lived: surrounded with respect and      affection.    </p>    <p>      The proper method of killing a pig seems to be a subject of      some contention. The Morton Salt booklet <em>A Complete      Guide to Home Meat Curing,</em> a part of which is      reprinted in MOTHER NO. 17, states; " <em>To butcher by      sticking only is the most practical, efficient method of      killing hogs, and also the most humane. It is best not to      stun or shoot a hog before sticking.</em> <em>"</em> We      could not conceive how such a procedure could be considered      "humane" in any way, shape, or form, so we read on.      Farmer's Bulletin No. 2138, <em>Slaughtering, Cutting and      Processing Pork on the Farm,</em> printed by the Department      of Agriculture, told us: <em>"Stun the hog by striking it      one sharp blow with a mechanical stunner or by shooting it      in the</em> forehead midway between and slightly above the      eyes. " This method sounded more reasonable, but somehow      lacked the detail that I felt I needed before I'd feel      confident to do the job as quickly and painlessly as      possible.    </p>    <p>      Finally a chapter from John and Sally Seymour's      <em>Farming</em> for <em>Self-Sufficiency,</em> reprinted      in MOTHER NO. 29, gave me the explicit information I was      after: <em>"I kill my pigs with a. 22 rifle which I claim      is the most humane method there could be . . . I always      shoot him in the brain. Draw a line with your imagination      from his left ear-hole to his right eye, and from his other      ear-hole to his other eye, and where the two lines cross,      shoot him. "</em> I was a bit worried that the power of a      .22-caliber bullet might not be enough to do the job,      because a friend had told me of a pig-killing he'd      witnessed which required three shots from a .38. Seymour's      advice has the ring of authority to it, however, and since      a .22 caliber weapon was all I bad available, I decided to      use it.    </p>    <p>      Everyone seems agreed that a pig should be starved for 24      hours prior to slaughter. (Even this isn't universal. As a      local farmer/hog killer put it: "Makes 'em a little cleaner      to work on, that's all . . . but land, we do so many it      don't matter." -MOTHER.) While it pained us to hear      Shirley's squeals of hungry indignation, we followed this      advice and, as the day wore on, became more than a little      alarmed at the possibility of her busting out of her pen.      She didn't, though, and early the next morning I went out      and fed her two quarts of homebrew. (Seymour recommends a      beer allowance for those butchering the hog, but we felt      that Shirley needed it more than we did.) Within the hour      she was a very mellow pig indeed. All that brew on an empty      stomach made her forget her hunger entirely, and when her      final moment came I can attest that she gave no sign that      she felt anything at all. I gave her an apple to eat and,      while she was placidly munching, shot her in the place      described. She fell over like a stone, whereupon I      immediately stuck her. In less than a minute she'd bled out      completely. It sounds brutal in the telling . . . but it      was a clean kill, and I felt good that I had done right by      my animal friend.    </p>    <p>      Now, there is one other point upon which most of the hog      experts seem to agree, and that is that the carcass must be      dipped in scalding water and scraped clean of hair and      dirt. The Morton Salt booklet and other authorities      describe the use of a "bell scraper", which is the best      tool for this purpose. I had searched all over northern New      Mexico for such a device, but was told everything from "I      haven't seen one of those in 20 years" to "They don't make      them anymore". Apparently even the small number of      individuals who still raise pigs have been brainwashed into      letting "George at the slaughterhouse" do the dirty work.      There are a few elderly Spanish-Americans around here,      however, who have held on to their independence . . . and      so I went to them to borrow a bell scraper.    </p>    <p>      At that point I learned that many of the old-timers in this      neck of the woods don't scrape their hogs at all . . . they      skin them. "What'cha want to scrape 'im for?" they asked.      "You gonna eat the skin?" There seemed to be so much common      sense in this approach that I went back to the books to see      if I could find some confirmation.    </p>    <p>      Sure enough, in "Feedback on Pigs and Pork" (MOTHER NO.      19), R.E. Rapp, M.D. had this to say: <em>"A lot of      equipment, hot water, and hard work can be dispensed with      if the carcass is simply washed</em> <em>off</em> <em>with      warm, soapy water and rinsed and skinned. . . instead of      being scalded and scraped as is traditional No one eats the      skin on bacon or ham anyway, and the pieces cure and store      just as well without it... so why all this scalding and      scraping and lifting 250-pound hogs in and out of hot      water? Shoot it, stick it, scrub it, and skin it. It works      well for me. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Foxfire Book</em> outlined a slightly different      approach: <em>"Another [informant] told us that they used      to hang the hog up by the nose, cut the hide</em>      <em>off</em> <em>in three-inch strips ('Hit'll come      plumb</em> <em>off</em> <em>pertiest you ever seen), and      gut it. "</em>    </p>    <p>      Well, skinning was the method we used and, while I have no      experience with scraping for comparison, I can say that      removing the hide is somewhat tedious but not at all      difficult (or at least the job <em>shouldn't</em> be      difficult under normal circumstances). In my case, it began      snowing about five minutes after I started the task. By the      time I'd finished there were two inches on the ground, and      my hands were numb claws.    </p>    <p>      It was at this stage of the game, incidentally, that we      began to run into some real contradictions on hogs. In the      February 1975 issue of <em>Organic Gardening and      Farming</em> magazine, Gene Logsdon advises: <em>"Get your      pig about April 15, or earlier if warm weather comes      earlier in your area. Then it will be ready to butcher by      August 1, before those miserably hot, late-summer days.      "</em>    </p>    <p>      Then again, one seriously begins to doubt the advisability      of slaughtering hogs at that season of the year when he      learns from Farmer's Bulletin No. <em>2138: "Fresh pork is      highly perishable; even at the customary refrigerator      temperature of 34° to 36° F it deteriorates more      rapidly than other meats. "</em> (Here in western North      Carolina, Thanksgiving is the traditional date for      do-it-yourself butchering. The local expert quoted above      farms all summer, kills pigs for his neighbors all winter,      and won't normally slaughter animals before late fall . . .      but this is partly a matter of convenience.-MOTHER.)    </p>    <p>      <em>The Foxfire Book,</em> quoting the University of      Georgia Agricultural booklet <em>Curing Georgia Hams      Country Style,</em> tells <em>us: "Kill hogs only when the      temperature is 32°-35° F. Souring bacteria multiply      rapidly at temperatures above 40°</em> F. " This sounds      like reasonable advice, but then the paragraph continues,      <em>Cure the meat immediately after slaughtering".. .</em>      directly contrary to information from the Morton Salt      guide, reprinted in MOTHER NO. 18 <em>: "Meat should not be      cut up and put in cure until it is thoroughly chilled. Bone      souring is often the result of meat being improperly      chilled or from the application of salt on warm meat.      "</em>    </p>    <p>      Well, in our case, a full-fledged mountain snowstorm was in      progress by the time we carried our skinned carcass to the      root cellar to hang... and-even had we previously      decided to "cure the meat immediately"-we'd have      changed our minds, because I was in no mood at all to      continue the job under such conditions. In my misery out      there in the whirling whiteness I had slashed my hand very      badly, and Shirley's and my blood were intermingled      splashes on the snow. What with one thing and another, we      let the pig hang overnight to chill out.    </p>        <p>      The next day, following the Morton Salt guide's directions      (MOTHER NO. 18), I cut the carcass into hams, roasts,      chops, and bacon. It was an instructive experience, for now      I have a real understanding of where all those      wrapped-in-plastic hunks of pork at the supermarket      originate (and also what a rip-off their prices are). Every      carnivore owes it to his education to cut meat at least      once in his life. It isn't at all difficult: Just go by the      directions in <em>A Complete Guide to Home Meat      Curing.</em>    </p>    <p>      Even Morton's literature, though, is not without some      contradictions. I purchased a box of that company's product      to cure our pork, and the information on the package said,      <em>"Morton Tender-Quick-Cure for Fresh and Frozen      Meats. Use fresh meat or completely thawed frozen meat.      "</em> Since it wasn't convenient to begin curing the hams      and bacon immediately, we put all the cuts into the      deep-freezer until such time as was more suitable.      Then-after it was too late-we reread the      installment of the Morton booklet in MOTHER NO. 18 and were      alarmed to discover the following: <em>"Meat that is      allowed to freeze, either before or after it is put in      cure, will never make as nice a finished product as if it      had not been frozen . . . . Frozen meat should be given      extra care and attention and should be used up as soon as      practicable after coming from the cure. "</em>    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, we were more than a little perturbed at      the possibility of winding up with inferior quality hams,      shoulders, and bacon, but we went ahead with the process      anyway. The dry-cure method described in the Morton booklet      sounded like the easiest, so that's the one we chose. If      you want to read some conflicting information on the curing      process, however, then the following quotations should      prove interesting:    </p>    <p>      <em>"For the dry cure, use Tender-Quick at the rate of 6      lbs. TenderQuick per 100 lbs. of loins. " (Morton Salt      guide, MOTHER NO. 19.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"We have a big slate salting bench. We dump dry salt on      this (you will need at least forty pounds of salt to do a      pig in comfort. If you wish to be more economical with salt      you will have to be a lot more careful and take a lot more      trouble. We just use a lot of salt and bury the pig in it).      " (John and Sally Seymour,</em> Farming for      Self-Sufficiency, <em>MOTHER NO. 29.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"There were different ways to begin the curing. Mann      Norton's father would simply `cover each hunk of meat      up</em> <em>good and white' with salt. Taylor Crockett      preferred eight pounds of salt for each hundred pounds of      meat. . . 'Valley John' Carpenter used simply five pounds      of salt for a two-hundred pound hog. Lon Reid used ten      pounds of salt per hundred pounds of meat. " (The</em>      Foxfire Book, pp. 199-200.)    </p>    <p>      <em>"The liquid formed from the meat juices will aid in      curing the heavier pieces. " (Sarah Funk, MOTHER NO. 18,      pg. 74.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>`Make sure meats don't rest in the brine that will      result as the moisture from the meat is drawn out by the      salt. "</em> (Stocking <em>Up, Rodale Press,</em> 1974,      <em>pg.</em> 299.)    </p>    <p>      And so on. Apparently the process isn't a particularly      critical one, and individual preferences play a large part      in the method chosen. We found that our pork, cured with      Morton Tender-Quick and Morton Sugar Cure according to the      manufacturer's instructions, tends to be just a shade more      salty to the taste than we're used to (though by no means      inedible). I think the clue here is that cured meats which      are purchased from the supermarket are treated for flavor      only, <em>not</em> for keeping qualities. It's just a      matter of getting used to the difference. We can't,      however, imagine what John and Sally Seymour's      hams-buried in 40 pounds of salt-must taste      like.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, don't make the mistake we did with the      shoulders. Since they were smaller than the hams, they came      out of the cure sooner . . . and we wrapped them tightly in      freezer paper to hold them until all the meat could be      smoked at the same time. When we unwrapped the shoulders,      however, they had a definite rancid odor which we attribute      to the fact that they were closely covered while still      fairly moist. We cured this condition reasonably well by      scrubbing the shoulders with warm water and drying them      thoroughly. The smoke took away any remaining unpleasant      smell, and the one we've eaten so far had a good flavor.    </p>    <p>      That brings us to the next step in the curing process . . .      and let me tell you right now that smoking our own meat was      one of the biggest thrills we've had around here in a long      time! The process is so absurdly simple and the results so      delicious that I can't understand why every homestead      doesn't have a smokehouse.    </p>    <p>      We constructed our smoker from a description in      <em>Stocking Up,</em> a recent Rodale Press book about the      home preservation of foods ($8.95 from Rodale Press,      Emmaus, Pennsylvania 18049 or from MOTHER'S Bookshelf). The      main unit-a junked refrigerator-was scrounged      from the dump, the compressor removed, and holes punched in      the top and bottom to receive six-inch stovepipe (see the      drawing). Eight lengths of pipe connect the smoker to a      firebox made from half of a 55-gallon drum. I made the      entire apparatus in only a few hours, and it works      beautifully.    </p>    <p>      As might be expected, there are plenty of contradictions      about the proper way to smoke meat. Here are a few of them:    </p>    <p>      <em>"Hams should be hung with the heavier side up and the      hock hanging down to retain the flavorful juices. " (Sarah      Funk, MOTHER NO. 18, pg. 75.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Hams and shoulders should be strung through the      shanks. "</em>    </p>    <p>      (Stocking Up, pg. 304.)    </p>    <p>      <em>"The ideal temperature for smoking is between 110°      and 120°F. " (Sarah Funk, pg. 75.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Do not allow the fire to get too hot. The ideal      smokehouse temperature is between 80° and</em> 90°      <em>F. This is called a cool smoke and is used to smoke      meat that is to be aged or held for many months. "      (Stocking Up, pg.</em> 306.)    </p>    <p>      <em>"Don't allow the temperature in the smokehouse to      exceed 100° F. " (The</em> Foxfire Book, pg. 201.)    </p>    <p>      <em>"A temperature from</em> 90° <em>to</em> 120° F      is <em>normally used; the lower temperatures are preferred.      " (Farmer's Bulletin No.</em> 2138, pg. 30.)    </p>    <p>      <em>"In building your smokehouse, don't be too concerned      with providing vents through which the smoke can escape.      The purpose is to hold the smoke in . . . it'll find its      own way out. " (Sarah Funk, pg. 7S.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"A draft is absolutely essential to the smoking      operation; without it the smoke will stagnate in the      smokehouse, and the smoked meat will have an objectionable,      sooty taste. "</em> (Stocking <em>Up, pg.</em> 293.)    </p>    <p>      A word about fuel: In MOTHER NO. 29, John and Sally Seymour      describe how they hang their pork in the chimney of their      fireplace to be smoked. They didn't mention the subject,      but they must burn hardwoods exclusively for heating.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hardwood only</em> is the rule for smoking. The pinyon      pine we use for fuel around here would soon ruin any ham so      we operated our smokehouse on oak. It's the only suitable      wood that's common in these parts and it gives meat a      delicious flavor and aroma. Hickory, of course, is      traditional, but the literature we've read seems agreed      that any hardwood will suffice. Even corncobs are      recommended.    </p>    <p>      I hung our hams according to Sarah's advice-heavy      side up-but I suspect that such a position is      necessary "to retain the flavorful juices" only in a hot      smokehouse when the pork is actually being cooked. (We      found from trial and error that this does happen at higher      temperatures. While the meat is utterly delicious in that      form, it won't keep well and should be eaten as soon as      possible . . . not hard advice to follow when the product      tastes so good!) I kept the hams at 90° F and found no      tendency for the juice to run at that heat.    </p>    <p>      The temperature of our refrigerator smokehouse was easy to      control by opening or closing the door slightly. A      thermometer was hung inside with the meat, and the      doorcrack adjusted every few minutes until the reading      remained constant. The hams were done in about two days of      more or less constant smoking. (The process is complete      when the meat takes on a rich chestnut color.) Following      the directions in <em>Stocking Up,</em> we loosely wrapped      each smoked piece separately in a paper bag, then a flour      sack, and stored them in a bin of wheat (any grain or      grain-like material will do).    </p>    <p>      Every writer seems agreed on the fact that home-grown pork      tastes superior to the supermarket variety. So, while we      expected our chops to be good, we were astounded at how      <em>much</em> better they were! There's almost no      comparison, and we can only feel sorry for those people who      must rely on agribusiness to fill their plates. If you      don't raise your own food, you don't know what real      victuals taste like. (One of our favorite cuts is "hog      jowl", sliced and fried like bacon and served with our own      eggs and homemade bread for breakfast.)    </p>    <p>      We regret we didn't keep closer records of how much money      we spent in raising Shirley Pearl, but with liberal      "guesstimating", we calculate that our pork cost us      somewhere in the neighborhood of 65-70 cents a pound. There      was nothing difficult in the entire experience, and we urge      anyone who is thinking about raising a pig to go "whole      hog". Ignore the experts who advise you to let the      slaughterhouse do the dirty work. Anyone with an IQ over 60      can handle the job, and the self-confidence you get from      doing it all yourself is worth many, many times the price      you'd pay to "let George do it".    </p>
