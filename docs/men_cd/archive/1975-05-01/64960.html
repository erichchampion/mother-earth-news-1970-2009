                           <p>      "If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have      time to do it over?" That's been our basic motto, and      usually it provides a pretty workable philosophy. Even the      best job is not necessarily permanent, though, and after 50      years or so even a well-built barbed wire fence may need to      be repaired.    </p>    <p>      One approach is to build a completely new fence alongside      the old one, preferably before the first completely gives      way. This may sound obvious, "right", and permanent, but it      may not be the most practical. method of going about the      job. A fence, you see, usually gives way at its weakest      point, buteven after it starts to go down-may still have      many very serviceable portions remaining.    </p>    <p>      These good sections can be salvaged with relative ease,      while only the broken parts must be replaced. (Note the use      of the word relative. It means that fence repair is easier      than laying cement blocks, for example. It also means that      an afternoon nap is easier than mending a fence.)    </p>    <p>      The best time to repair a barbed wire fence is just before      it goes down. Sure, trying to work in the existing fence      row is difficult . . . but you'll at least be able to      choose the hours you want to put in on the chore. Once the      strands are suddenly down-on the other hand-and      the livestock are getting outor in!-it has to be      fixed then and there.    </p>    <p>      You'll find that it is easiest to replace defective posts      first. Start by unfastening the strands of wire (whether      tied or stapled to the upright) without cutting them. The      broken post-stump and all-is then removed. (A      pair of posthole diggers comes in very handy at this      point.)    </p>    <p>      A replacement post is next set about two feet deep in the      hole from which the broken upright was removed. And please      notice that I said "replacement" instead of "new". While it      doesn't make much sense to substitute a semi-rotten post      for a rotten one, it's often possible to scrounge (from the      toolshed or farm shop) a long-forgotten post of about the      same age and quality as the better ones still standing in      the fence row.    </p>    <p>      Whether your replacement post is brand new or reclaimed,      you'll have to push the strand of barb out of the way to      get it into position. An inch or two will usually do the      trick and-if you wear heavy enough clothes to protect      you from the wires' spikes-you can manage that quite      simply by just standing on the post side of the strands and      leaning against the stretched wires.    </p>    <p>      The "new" post is aligned by sighting along the tops of the      existing uprights, to see that it's as close to      perpendicular as possible. It can then be tamped solidly      into place.    </p>    <p>      Tamping does not mean just shoveling all of the loose dirt      back into the hole (although that might well be sufficient      to hold the weight of the post). To do the job right, earth      should be packed around the upright from the bottom up,      with a small amount of dirt placed in the hole at a time      and firmed with vertical blows from a blunt, heavy object      such as a crowbar. The post should seem steady long before      the hole is filled to ground level . . . and when that is      done, the post shouldn't budge even when you lean against      it with full weight.    </p>    <p>      Once you've replaced all the defective posts in a bad      length of barbed fence, you'll still have to contend with      broken strands of wire. Luckily, although barbed wire is      normally stretched a full roll at a time, there is      frequently no need to replace a whole run of wire.    </p>    <p>      Repairing a snapped wire is a job for two people. When a      strand breaks, the whole fence becomes looser. Therefore,      it's necessary to restretch each end of the severed wire to      make the tence taut once again. To tackle this job properly      you'll need a carpenter's wrecking bar, a pair of work      gloves, a hammer, and some staples.    </p>    <p>      Start at the post nearest the shorter length of broken wire      by hooking a barb from the loose strand in the claw of the      wrecking bar. (Holding the loose wire along the shaft of      the bar will give you better control over the length of      barb.) Then, using the post for leverage, pull the wire      tight and have your. partner staple it. (See accompanying      photos.) Half the broken wire is now repaired.    </p>    <p>      Enough additional wire now must be spliced to the remaining      loose strand of barb so that it will reach the fencepost.      (You may be able to get this "new" wire at the same place      you got the "new" post.) To fasten the strands together,      first loop about eight inches of the broken wire around the      "new" one. Then, using the new strand as a crosspiece,      twist the old wire tightly around itself a few times. (See      photos.) You can then finish the splice with the help of      your wrecking bar.    </p>    <p>      Hold the bar vertically, with the claw against the ground      and the shaft sticking straight up. Wrap the new wire once      around the top of the bar, and then twist it around itself.      The prybar will give you the leverage you need to make      good, tight turns which will prevent slippage when the      fence is up. (See photo.)    </p>    <p>      Once the splice is complete, stretch the lengthened wire      and staple it to the same fencepost-and in the same      way-to which you attached the first strand. (Don't      forget, you need two people for this job.) The barb is now      tight and continuous . . . and, just as important, there is      equal tension on each side of the post.    </p>    <p>      When you have all the replacement posts up and the wires      spliced, the second still must be properly fastened to the      first. (Remember that each strand has to be attached at      every upright.) If the posts are made of wood, the wires      already stretched, and the fence is considered only      semi-permanent, this last chore can be handled quickly with      staples. Ties, however, spiffy up the stretching job, act      as a more secure fastening device, and have no single      pressure point to give way. For these reasons, it's a very      good idea to attach the strands of barb-especially      old, loose ones-to the uprights with ties.    </p>    <p>      The principle is simple: Wrap a plain wire tightly around a      post so that it holds a barbed strand on both sides.    </p>    <p>      You'll need 18 inches of tie wire for each intersection of      wire and post. While standing in front of the upright on      the barb side, wrap the plain wire around the horizontal      strand on the left side of the post. Next, push the barbed      wire in on the left while you loop the fastener behind the      post and wrap it tightly around the barb on the other      (right) side. (See photo.) The more pressure the fastener      exerts on the strand, the tighter the fence, and the better      the tie.    </p>    <p>      To finish the job, loop the tie wire back behind the post      once more and wrap it around the barb on the left side of      the upright again. A barb fastened to a post in this way      should hold your weight without slipping. (See photo.)    </p>    <p>      There you are . . . a functional fence again. Not as neat      as the original, perhaps, but it'll do the job!    </p>

It you wear heavy clothes for the job, you can hold back the wires with your body while you line up replacement posts. SECOND FROM TOP: Even a treated post rots after many years in the ground. Choose a sound substitute and tamp the earth well around it so the new support can take its share of the load. THIRD FROM TOP: The shorter end of a broken wire must be pulled tight and stapled firmly to the nearest post before splicing. Begin by hooking a barb in the claw of a carpenter'.,, wrecking bar. FOURTH FROM TOP: Hold the loose end of the wire along the shaft of the bar and pull the strand right-using the post for leverage-while your partner drives in the staples. FIFTH FROM TOP: To splice the broken wire, a new strand is held as a crosspiece while the old length is looped around it and twisted back on itself several times. Sharp turns are necessary to avoid slippage. SIXTH FROM TOP: The wrecking bar can be used to keep the new length of wire steady while you twist the strand around itself. SEVENTH FROM TOP: Remove the slack by pushing the barbed wire with the left hand and pulling the tie with the right. EIGHTH FROM TOP: After splicing, the wire must be stretched and attached to the post . . . and on an older fence this is better done by tying than by stapling. First, support the barbed strand and take a few turns of plain wire around it with the left hand. NINTH FROM TOP:More slack is taken up by pushing the barbed length with the right hand while wrapping the tie with the left. TENTH FROM TOP:A good tie is strong enough to hold your weight.
