            			       <h3>BEEF</h3>      <h3>DAIRY</h3>                                                    <p>      The animals shown on the left side of this poster are      examples of the breeds of beef cattle most commonly raised      in the U.S. All have been specially bred to produce large      amounts of meat at low cost.    </p>    <p>      The Santa Gertrudis is a Shorthorn-Brahman cross developed      on the King Ranch in Texas and is suited to hot, humid      climates. Its tolerance for heat is inherited from the      Brahman (or Zebu), a humped breed of Indian origin which      thrives in this country's southern coastal regions.    </p>    <p>      Herefords ("whitefaces") are eager grazers and the most      popular American beef breed. The one shown above belongs to      the Polled (hornless) strain. The fast-gaining, easily      reared Shorthorn also occurs in a polled form. A second      variation-the Milking Shorthorn-is raised for      both beef and dairy use.    </p>    <p>      The black Aberdeen-Angus (plain Angus to most of us) is a      hornless breed that produces "marbled" beef of very high      quality.    </p>    <p>      Actually, much of the beef marketed in this country comes      from dairy cattle: unpromising heifers, unproductive cows,      and males not wanted for breeding. Bull calves raised for      food are castrated for safer handling and improved meat.      Steers of any breed can also be trained as work animals . .      . in which case they're called oxen.    </p>    <p>      Cows of the dairy breeds are shown on the right. The      gentle, sensitive Jersey is the smallest in size and yield      (two to four gallons a day of rich milk, with a butterfat      content of over 5 percent). The calmer golden Guernsey's      milk is slightly more abundant and contains somewhat less      fat.    </p>    <p>      The docile Brown Swiss-one of the oldest dairy      breeds-gives pure white milk with a high level of      non-fat solids, minerals, and lactose . . . excellent for      cheesemaking.    </p>    <p>      Like the Brown Swiss, the long-horned Ayrshire is a fairly      heavy producer (between Guernsey and Holstein). It's hardy      and thrives in hill country.    </p>    <p>      The largest and most popular milk cow is the      Holstein-Friesian (Holstein in the U.S. and Friesian in      Great Britain). She's a placid creature, and her milk      contains only 3.7 percent butterfat but is given in great      abundance. . . six gallons or more per day.    </p>
