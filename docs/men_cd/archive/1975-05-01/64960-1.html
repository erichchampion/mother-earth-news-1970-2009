        ABOVE TOP:To repair an existing barbed wire fence means working under difficult conditions. It you wear heavy clothes for the job, you can hold back the wires with your body while you line up replacement posts. SECOND FROM TOP: Even a treated post rots after many years in the ground. Choose a sound substitute and tamp the earth well around it so the new support can take its share of the load. THIRD FROM TOP: The shorter end of a broken wire must be pulled tight and stapled firmly to the nearest post before splicing. Begin by hooking a barb in the claw of a carpenter'.,, wrecking bar. FOURTH FROM TOP: Hold the loose end of the wire along the shaft of the bar and pull the strand right-using the post for leverage-while your partner drives in the staples. FIFTH FROM TOP: To splice the broken wire, a new strand is held as a crosspiece while the old length is looped around it and twisted back on itself several times. Sharp turns are necessary to avoid slippage. SIXTH FROM TOP: The wrecking bar can be used to keep the new length of wire steady while you twist the strand around itself. SEVENTH FROM TOP: Remove the slack by pushing the barbed wire with the left hand and pulling the tie with the right. EIGHTH FROM TOP: After splicing, the wire must be stretched and attached to the post . . . and on an older fence this is better done by tying than by stapling. First, support the barbed strand and take a few turns of plain wire around it with the left hand. NINTH FROM TOP:More slack is taken up by pushing the barbed length with the right hand while wrapping the tie with the left. TENTH FROM TOP:A good tie is strong enough to hold your weight.
