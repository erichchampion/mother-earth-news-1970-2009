            <h2 id="subtitle">Special Carp Catchin',Cleanin'<br />and Eatin'Section</h2>        <h5 id="byline">      by FERRIS WEDDLE    </h5>            <p>      Sometimes I get the impression that guests at my table may      be just a bit wary . . . when they're not downright worried      about what they're eating. This is true, anyway, of those      who've read my articles extolling the gourmet delights of      many foods that are unused-or underused-because      of prejudice.    </p>    <p>      These little cutlets, now, could they be rattlesnake?      Truthfully, no. I've heard such fare praised, but frankly I      haven't gotten up enough nerve to give it a try. If I were      starving . . . well, maybe I would.    </p>    <p>      Then there's always some suspicion about wild plants,      berries, and whatnot. Can I be <em>certain</em> they're      non-poisonous? Yes, I can, or I wouldn't try them myself .      . . especially the mushrooms that I eat <em>only</em> when      I have absolutely no doubts about their safety.    </p>    <p>      The fish on the table-fresh, pickled, canned, in      loaves, or whatever-may be a different matter,      however. That is, it may not be trout, bass, salmon, or any      of the so-called "game species. Instead, it could very well      be some of the numerous varieties we tend to label as      "trash" or "rough" fish . . .you know, carp, suckers,      chiselmouths, squawfish, bullhead catfish and others in the      non-game category.    </p>    <p>      Even though my guests may eat these fish with pleasure and      praise, many will nevertheless appear somewhat shaken when      they're informed of the exact species they've consumed. The      old business of, "Ughhh . . . trash fish!"    </p>    <p>      Such a reaction is, as far as I'm concerned, plain silly.      Why all this fuss about labels? Such traditional biases are      doubly ridiculous during the present inflation, with      salmon, tuna, and so on soaring into the luxury class. Even      the once inexpensive=: mackerel and sardines have price      tags that send me to the nearest stream, lake, or reservoir      to catch my own fish.    </p>    <p>      On many such expeditions, my quarry is carp. This prolific      fish-introduced into the U.S. by more appreciative      Europeans way back in the 1880's-has become a bit      more acceptable as food than some "trash" species . . . and      is also getting a reputation as a darned tricky creature to      catch with light tackle. As a result, several million      pounds of carp are harvested and sold as human food      throughout this country each year. Even more is used to      feed pets, chickens, and hatchery-reared fish.    </p>    <p>      Carp caught in non-stagnant waters make excellent eating      whether baked, fried, pickled, smoked, or canned for use in      patties, loaves, and so on. Almost as good are the many      varieties of suckers. Their meat is softer when canned, but      also very sweet and flavorful . . . and far superior to      mackerel.    </p>    <p>      Skinning these and other rough fish eliminates a lot of      their undesirable strong flavor. . . and is the easiest way      to prepare: them anyway. A soak in a salt or vinegar      solution also helps to control odor problems, especially if      the catch came from somewhat stagnant water.    </p>    <p>      Canning fish-and meat in general-isn't as      difficult as some people believe, but a pressure cooker      must be used and the directions for treatment of these,      spoilage-prone foods must be strictly followed. The packed      jars, for instance, are <em>always</em> processed in the      cooker for at least 90 minutes at a pressure of 10 pounds.    </p>    <p>      Since methods of canning fish vary with the species      (because of differences in firmness of flesh and so on), a      good book on the subject should be consulted. Some useful      source are <em>Putting Food By</em> by Ruth Hertzberg,      Beatrice Vaughan, and Janet Greene, $4.50; <em>Butchering,      Processing and Preserve tion of Meat</em> by Frank G.      Ashbrook, $4.95; and <em>Complete</em> <em>Guide to Home      Canning, Preserving and Freezing</em> by the U.S.      Department of Agriculture, $2.50. All are available through      MOTHER'S Bookshelf. You might also want to consult      Conservation Bulletin <em>28, Home Canning of Fishery      Products,</em> U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington,      D.C. 20242 (current price available from the publisher).      The <em>Kerr Home Canning Book</em> (Kerr Glass      Corporation, Consumer Products Division, Dept. TMEN, Sand      Springs, Oklahoma 74063) and <em>The Ball Blue Book</em>      (Ball Brothers Company, Muncie, Indiana 47302) are very      reliable guides to home canning.    </p>    <p>      A good pickling recipe will produce a product that can be      used directly from the jar (which should be pint or      half-pint sized only). Here's one I picked out of an      intriguing cookbook issued by the South Dakota Department      of Game, Fish, and Parks (Pierre, South Dakota 57501). It's      called <em>Cooking the</em> <em>Sportsman's Harvest</em> ,      costs only one dollar, and contains directions for      preparing many infrequently used fish, mammals and birds.    </p>        <p>      Pack chunks of raw fish into pint or half-pint jars. The      pieces can be one to two inches long or larger, depending      on the species. Mix together:    </p>    <p>      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1/4 cup vinegar<br />      1/4 cup tomato cocktail sauce<br />      1 teaspoon brown sugar    </p>    <p>      Pour this solution over the fish, leaving the usual inch of      head space. Seal the jars and process there an a pressure      cooker at 10 pounds for 90 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Some pickling recipes advise simply soaking fish in a salt      brine for a few hours (even overnight), rinsing it several      times in cold water, and then canning. Or you could try the      following method to make a sardine-like product from      squawfish, suckers, chiselmouth, or carp:    </p>    <p>      To each pint jar of fish pieces, <em>add</em> <em>the      following:</em>    </p>    <p>      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1 teaspoon vinegar<br />      1/4 teaspoon dried onion flakes or onion salt<br />      1 teaspoon olive oil or soy oil<br />      Dried hot pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      The seasoning can, of course, be varied. If you like      mustard, add about one tablespoonful to each pint of fish.      . . or try horseradish or tomato sauce. Then seal the jars      and process them in a pressure cooker at 10 pounds for 90      minutes.    </p>    <p>      If you want pickled fish without canning, here's a basic      recipe (also from the South Dakota cookbook)    </p>    <p>      Fillet whatever fish you have, and cut the pieces into      strips one inch wide. Pack the chunks loosely into quart or      other jars until the containers are about 3/4 full. Add to      each quart:    </p>    <p>      3 tablespoons salt<br />      1/4 cup sugar<br />      2 teaspoons pickling spices<br />      1 medium onion, diced    </p>    <p>      Top off the jar with vinegar (white is often preferred) and      refrigerate it for about four days. The mixture will keep a      long time in the refrigerator, and should be shaken up a      bit from time to time.    </p>        <p>      It's fortunate that there are so many delicious ways to      prepare carp, suckers, and the like . . . because they'll      be much more common in the diet of the future. As the      world's population continues to grow-with no      corresponding increases in food production nor advances in      our system of distribution-trash and rough fish, both      freshwater and saltwater, are becoming increasingly      important sources of protein. In the years ahead, hungry      people will discard their squeamishness and these highly      prolific species will be not only acceptable but      respectable. When I eat my canned rough fish, I'm glad I      got rid of my own prejudices long ago.    </p>
