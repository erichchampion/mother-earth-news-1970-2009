                <p>      SPRING GARDEN    </p>        <p>      <strong>You can easily turn mere dirt into fertile garden      loam</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Gail Damerow    </h5>        <p>      I thought I knew a lot about garden soil until I moved to      my present home and tried to plant my first garden there. I      wandered out with a shovel to turn the soil for spring      planting, and ended up scurrying for a pick-ax to break up      the hard-packed clay. It was a far cry from my previous      garden, which had such beautiful loamy soil that I could      (and often did) harvest potatoes simply by rooting for them      with my hands.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, I needed to know more about the relationship      between clay and loam before I could turn the former into      the latter.    </p>    <h3>      Garden Loam    </h3>    <p>      The first thing I learned is that clay is one of three      basic soil types, the other two being sand and silt. All      three are made up of rock particles. Clay, as I learned the      hard way, consists of fine particles that turn brickhard      when dry and that cling to a shovel when wet. Sand, I knew      from my years living in the Arizona desert, is coarse,      gritty, and porous, whether dry or wet. Silt lies halfway      between clay and sand. When wet, it sticks together but      doesn't stick to a shovel.    </p>    <p>      Loam (aha!) contains a mixture of clay, sand, silt, and      humus. Since clay, sand, and silt are made up of rock      minerals, they comprise the inorganic component of loam.      Humus, by contrast, is decomposed plant matter and is      therefore the organic component. Good garden loam contains      at least S% humus, and humus improves sandy soil by      increasing its ability to absorb and retain moisture. It      also improves clay soil by loosening it, making the soil      easier to work, and preventing surface crusting so that      sprouting plants don't have to struggle so hard to pop      through. This is just what my clay soil needed.    </p>    <p>      An obvious source of humus is used barn bedding, worked      directly into the soil. But it was spring and I was ready      to plant. I didn't have time to wait for "hot" manure to      decompose. Fall is the time to work manure-soaked bedding      into the soil, in anticipation of spring planting. Another      obvious source of humus is compost, but I had just moved      and didn't yet have a compost pile. I remedied that right      away by nailing some planks into a series of      four-foot-square corrals and tossing in all the kitchen      scraps, grass clippings, and other organic matter I could      get my hands on. Kept slightly moist and aerated by      occasional turning, the "pile" would one day provide all      the compost my garden needed.    </p>    <p>      Like any other source of humus, compost improves soil      texture and makes the soil easier to work. Compost also      adds nutrients and encourages the growth of beneficial      soil-borne microorganisms that dissolve those nutrients, so      they can be readily absorbed by plant roots. But my compost      pile was growing slowly and decomposing even more slowly. I      needed lots of humus in a hurry. So I called a local saw      mill and had them deliver several truckloads of well rotted      sawdust to till into my garden. Voila! I had loam. But it      wasn't yet <em>fertile</em> loam.    </p>    <h3>      Plant Nutrients    </h3>    <p>      Clay, sand, silt, and humus all contribute certain      nutrients that plants need in order to grow and thrive.      Just what kind of nutrients loam contains, and how much of      each, depends on three things: the sources of the mineral      and organic matter making up the soil, the degree to which      the soil has been weathered and eroded, and the amount of      nutrients used up by plants previously grown in the soil.    </p>    <p>      The major plant nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and      potassium or "potash" (K)-are the most likely nutrients to      be deficient in garden soil. Bagged fertilizers have three      numbers on the label (5-10-5, for example), representing      the percentage of each nutrient that the fertilizer      contains. Chemical fertilizers contain only those elements.      Fertilizers derived from natural sources contain, in      addition, a variety of micro nutrients, or trace elements,      that plants use in lesser amounts. While chemical      fertilizers can be manufactured to precise specifications,      natural fertilizers vary somewhat in NPK values, depending      on the source. Any good garden book lists various sources      and their average NPK values. If you buy a bagged natural      fertilizer, such as bone meal or blood meal, the label will      tell you the NPK value for that particular lot. Compared to      natural fertilizers, chemical fertilizers appear to be less      expensive. They also dissolve more readily in water, giving      plants a quicker boost. But because they dissolve so      readily, chemical fertilizers also quickly leach out of the      soil. Natural fertilizers, on the other hand, release      nutrients over a longer period of time. In the long run,      therefore, natural fertilizers are a better buy.    </p>    <p>      Natural fertilizers are a good deal for other reasons as      well. Compared to chemical fertilizers, they don't burn the      delicate roots of seedlings, they don't destroy beneficial      microorganisms in the soil, and they increase a plant's      resistance to disease. Chemical fertilizers do just the      opposite, which works out nicely for the manufacturers of      chemical products, since they sell more insecticides,      fungicides, and other chemical poisons.    </p>    <h3>      Natural Fertilizers    </h3>    <p>      When you add lots of compost to keep up the humus level of      your garden, you don't have to worry much about NPK. Good      compost provides most of the nutrients plants need. But if      you're in the process of building up soil fertility, like I      am, your garden plants need an occasional NPK boost.      Furthermore, applying a little fertilizer at strategic      times helps any plant reach its fullest potential.      Strategic times to fertilize are: when a plant develops      true leaves, when it begins to bloom, and again when it      starts setting fruit.    </p>    <p>      If you have access to manure, you can provide a quick      nitrogen pickme-up for any plant that's about to bloom by      giving it a shot of manure tea. Cover manure in water and      let it steep for about a month, strain out the solids (toss      them into your compost heap), and dilute the liquid to the      color of weak tea.    </p>    <p>      Another good source of nitrogen is dried blood meal, a      slaughter-house byproduct. A good source of phosphorus is      bone meal, a slaughter-house product made of steamed,      ground-up bones. Heating it with wood gives you a ready      source of potassium in the ashes from your stove-about 50      pounds of ashes for every cord you burn. In addition to      supplying potassium, wood ashes also sweeten acidic soil.      Soil acidity (pH) is measured on a scale of 0 to 14; 7 is      neutral. Soil that's be low 7 is acidic; soil that's above      7 is alkaline. Extremes in pH tie up nutrients, and most      vegetables do best in neutral soil.    </p>    <p>      The ashes of dense hardwoods like oak and hickory are best      for sweetening soil. Apply no more than 20 pounds per 1,000      square feet per year. If your soil is on the alkaline side,      you can lower the pH by working in sawdust, leaf mold, or      peat moss. Because I used lots of sawdust to improve my      soil's humus level, I also added ashes to balance its pH.      Now that I've got plenty of compost, my soil's acidity      takes care of itself, since compost tends to neutralize pH.      Despite all the sawdust, ashes, and compost I've added, my      garden's soil still isn't perfect-but it is well on its      way.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOIL TESTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      To find out what's in the soil in your garden, fill a quart      jar one-third full with soil and two-thirds full with      water. Shake the jar and set it aside until the soil      settles into layers: The bottom layer will be sand; above      the sand will be a layer of silt; then comes a layer of      day; and on top of the water will float undecomposed      organic matter. A good mix contains about 20 percent clay,      40 percent silt, and 20 percent sand plus organic matter.      Another way to find out what kind of soil you have is to      squeeze a moist sample in your hand. If the soil forms a      tight, sticky ball, it contains too much clay. If it feels      grainy and crumbles no matter how hard you squeeze, it has      too much sand. If it forms a loose mound when you squeeze      gently, but crumbles when you squeeze harder, you've got      good garden loam.    </p>    <h3>      Acid Test    </h3>    <p>      Old-time gardeners used to taste their soil to find out      whether it was acidic or alkaline. If the soil tasted sour,      it was acidic; if bitter, it was alkaline. If it tasted      sweet, it was just right. You don't have to eat dirt to      test your soil's pH. You can buy a pH test kit, or you can      shake a tablespoon of dry soil and a tablespoon of white      vinegar together in a jar small. Put the jar to your ear.      If it fizzes, your soil is alkaline. If the fizzing is      weak, or you hear nothing at all, clean the jar and put in      another tablespoon of soil. Add a few drops of ammonia and      fill the jar two-thirds full with distilled water (you can      use rain water if you're sure it isn't acid rain). Set the      jar aside for a couple of hours. If the water turns dark,      your soil is acidic.    </p>    <h3>      Sources for Natural    </h3>    <p>      Fertilizers:<br />      Earlee, Inc.<br />      2002 Highway 62<br />      Jeffersonville, IN 47130<br />      812-282-9134<br />      <br />      Erth-Rite, Inc.<br />      RD 1 Box 243<br />      Gap, PA 17527<br />      717-442-4171    </p>    <p>      Mellinger's, Inc.<br />      2310 W South Range Road<br />      North Lima, OH 44452<br />      800-321-7444<br />      <br />      Necessary Trading Company<br />      PO Box 305<br />      New Castle, VA 24127<br />      703-864-5103<br />      <br />      Peaceful Valley Farm Supply<br />      PO Box 2209<br />      Grass Valley, CA 95945<br />      916-272-4769    </p>
