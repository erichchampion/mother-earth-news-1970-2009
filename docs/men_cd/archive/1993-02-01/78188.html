                <p><strong>      SEASONS    </strong></p>        <p><strong>      Sure-fire ways to tell that springtime is near.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Fred Schaaf    </h5>        <p>      If you're dreaming of warmer weather, outdoor walks, and      starting up your outdoor garden again, you're not alone.      Most of us are anxiously waiting for the return of the      robin--herald of spring. In fact, Americans get so hyped-up      for the upcoming season that we have actually created a day      for trying to predict when spring will arrive (a.k.a.      Groundhog Day). Sure we still have the rest of winter to      endure, but we <em>can</em> pursue the subject of spring's      arrival--in the calendar, the weather, the living world,      the heavens, and the holidays.    </p>    <h3>      Seasons and Calendar    </h3>    <p>      Technically, spring begins in the Northern Hemisphere when      the sun moves northward enough to pass overhead as seen      from Earth's equator. We call this point-and the sun's      reaching of it-the spring, or <em>vernal</em> equinox.      (Equinox means "equal night," referring to the fact that      day and night are equal in length at this time of year.) It      is also at spring equinox (and autumn equinox) that people      all over the world can see the sun rise exactly due east      and set exactly due west.    </p>    <p>      The first day of spring always falls on one of two days:      March 20 or 21. This year, 0you can celebrate on March 20      at 9:42 A.m., Eastern Standard Time. Will that be the      moment when we feel warmer, see a burst of green around us,      smell flowers leaping into bloom? Doubtful. As Henry Van      Dyke put it in <em>Fisherman's Luck,</em> "The first day of      spring is one thing, and the first spring day is another.      The difference between them is sometimes as great as a      month." Also, a first spring day is generally followed by a      few cold snaps and a return to winter, a kind of reversed      Indian Summer. On March 7, 1855, Henry David Thoreau noted      in his journal: "The first pleasant days of spring come out      like a squirrel and go in again."    </p>    <h3>      In Like a Lion, Out Like a Lamb    </h3>    <p>      Most of us have learned to expect nothing from March except      the unexpected. We should be well aware that weather in      this month is a throw of the dice, a total gamble. In fact,      March is appropriately named for the Roman war god, Mars,      since no other month brings such a war between warm and      cold, between winter's refusal to leave and spring's      insistence on coming. If March 1 is a peaceful, almost      balmy day, you can be relatively sure that March 31 will be      stormy and cold.    </p>    <p>      Most people tend to recall the spectacular; in weather,      this means storms. The frequency of tornadoes takes a leap      up in March, most of them occurring well south in the Gulf      states. Some parts of the country may experience violent      thunderstorms, followed by blizzards or ice storms. I      recall that March of 1989 in our town was a month of flu,      4" of sleet on the ground, tornado watches, and one of the      most spectacular Northern Lights displays of our lives-all      these happenings violent or eerie, unsettling and potent,      and sometimes occuring with great beauty, as in the case of      the Northern Lights. March has been the month of the most      devastating tornado and the most famous blizzard ever (see      "Almanac Timetable").    </p>    <p>      But then, just when you can't stand it anymore, when you      are sick of bulky sweaters and sore throats, March brings      us closer to the equinox-the sun gets higher and the days      lengthen more rapidly. December, January, and February are      the true winter months; March makes a stride towards what      most of us think is the most delicious of outdoor weather.      The proof is in March's effects on plants and animals.    </p>    <h3>      The Living World    </h3>    <p>      Although the length of day plays a direct role in starting      changes in plants and migrations in animals, much also      depends on temperature. Spring peepers don't begin their      calling until the average temperature rises above about      50°F, but the most famous animal indicator of spring      moves north in both the eastern and western United States,      almost precisely with the 37°F line. That is the air      temperature at which the ground is generally thawed enough      to permit earthworms to come to the surface-where they will      soon become the meal of the arriving robin.    </p>    <p>      In reality, robins aren't entirely absent throughout the      United States during winter. The catch is that robins who      live quite far north in summer may not go as far south. For      instance, Canadian robins may be seen in winter in the      mid-Atlantic states. Nevertheless, their numerous arrival      in March is a noticeable event. Incidentally, it's male      robins who show up first; females arrive weeks later,      setting the males to singing, as mating and territory      rituals begin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Americans get so hyped-up about the coming of      spring that we actually created a day for<br />      groundhogs to predict its arrival.</strong>    </p>    <p>      In March, the southernmost United States sees oats and corn      and other spring crops coming out of the ground. Spring      wheat is planted in the southern part of the wheat belt.      Fruit trees blossom across much of the South. But in the      northern states, only a few hard plants are sprouting, and      a few of the earliest flowers and flowering bushes are      putting forth their blossoms.    </p>    <h3>      Astronomy    </h3>    <p>      Regardless of weather, February and March evenings bring      forth the same familiar constellations in the sky each      year. The brightest star, Sirius, twinkles mostly      blue-white in the South. Over in the Northeast, the Big      Dipper stands on its handle like a giant question mark in      the early evening. One sure sign of spring coming is Leo      the Lion, with his heart-star Regulus, rising in the East      after nightfall. But in February-March 1993, the      constellations are upstaged by four bright evening planets,      two of which-Mercury and Venus-are at their highest due to      spring's celestial geometry.    </p>    <p>      Mercury never sets too long after the sun. But for about a      week before and week after February 21 this year, you may      spot it as a fairly bright point of light low in the West,      roughly 45 minutes after sunset.    </p>    <p>      Venus is now so brilliant that it may be mistaken for an      airplane or reported as a UFO; you may be able to find it,      about halfway up the Southwest sky, even before sunset. The      most spectacular sky sight for the whole United States in      the first five months of 1993 may be the very close pairing      of Venus and the crescent Moon at nightfall on February 24      (see diagram on page 19). That night, Venus is at its      greatest brilliancy and may actually surpass the thin      Moon's brightness.    </p>    <p>      As March begins, Venus is setting more than three hours      after the sun, but by month's end it will sink below the      horizon only a few minutes after the sun does. This is      Venus' most dramatic exit from the evening sky in eight      years and offers us our best chance to see several amazing      sights: the long skinny crescent phase of Venus in steadily      held binoculars; Venus as    </p>    <p>      "Evening Star" one night and "Morning Star" the next      morning (see diagram).    </p>    <p>      Our other evening planets are Mars and Jupiter, and both      are now excellent to turn your telescope towards, if you      have one. (See accompanying diagrams to help find them.)    </p>    <h3>      Special Days    </h3>    <p>      -In January or early February, you may be so desperate for      spring that you are ready to believe a colorful piece of      weather lore which, in fact, has no real basis. Welcome to      Groundhog Day.    </p>    <p>      February 2 is about halfway between the winter solstice and      spring equinox. Thus it became one of the year's four      "cross-quarter days," halfway between the starts of the      seasons. And this seemed an appropriate time to try and      judge what the second half of winter would be like: "If      candlemas be fair and bright/Winter will have another      flight/But if it be dark with clouds and rain/Winter is      gone, and will not come again." Why would a fair day      suggest that the rest of winter would be cold? Fair days in      winter do tend to be somewhat colder, but the fact is that      February 2 fair and cold tells nothing of what the days      ahead will be like.    </p>    <p>      The groundhog theme probably came from the idea of      hibernating animals coming out, finding the air too cold,      and going back to wait out more winter. Whatever the case,      tradition arose from Great Britain and Germany, where it      was the bear or badger that came out. In the eastern United      States-the groundhog (woodchuck) has been substituted. And      one particular groundhog in Pennsylvania has become the      media's star performer in this supposed predicting act.    </p>    <h3>      SKY CALENDAR OF SPECIAL EVENTS FOR 1993    </h3>    <p>      FEBRUARY    </p>    <p>      MARCH    </p>    		<p>      <strong>Almanac for February and March 1993<br />      (All times given in Eastern Standard Time.)</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>February</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 First Quarter Moon (6 p .m.)<br />      2 Candlemas; Groundhog Day<br />      6 Full Moon (7 P .m.)<br />      12 Lincoln's Birthday (1809)<br />      13 Last Quarter Moon (10 A.M.)<br />      14 St. Valentine's Day<br />      15 Presidents Day<br />      21 New Moon (8 A.M.); Mercury at greatest evening      elongation<br />      22 Washington's Birthday (1732)<br />      23 Mardi Gras<br />      24 Ash Wednesday; spectacular Venus-Moon conjunction (see      text and diagram)    </p>    <p>      <strong>March</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 First Quarter Moon (11 A.M.)<br />      8 Full Moon (Closest for year, so expect high tides!)<br />      9 Moon near Jupiter this evening<br />      12 Blizzard of '88 (1888) in full fury in NY, New      England<br />      14 Last Quarter Moon (11 P .m.)<br />      17 St Patrick's Day<br />      18 Tri-state Tornado killed 695 in Missouri, Illinois, and      Indiana (1925)<br />      19 The swallows return to San Juan Capistrano,      California<br />      20 Spring equinox (9:41 A.M.)<br />      21 Moon at farthest of year (2 P.M.)<br />      23 New Moon (2 A.M.); look with binoculars 20 minutes after      sunset for ultra-thin moon well below Venus!<br />      24 Lovely thin moon to upper left of Venus at      nightfall<br />      25 Annunciation, or Lady Day<br />      Moon near the Pleiades star cluster tonight, near star      Aldebaran tomorrow night<br />      29 Jupiter is brightest, and at 'opposition," rising in the      east at sunset; (binoculars recommended for best view; see      diagrams)    </p>
