            		<p>		<strong> BITS AND PIECES</strong></p>         <p><strong>      Kernel Send Signal to Wasps: Need help Quick!!</strong>    </p>        <p>      When caterpillars attack corn leaves, corn fights back.      First a signal is emitted; then the corn kernels call in a      troop of parasitic wasps to surprise attack the      caterpillars. Female rescue wasps lay their eggs directly      into the enemy caterpillars, and when they hatch, the      larvae feast on the caterpillar's insides. As the larvae      mature, they crawl out of the caterpillars as wasps and fly      away. Mission accomplished.    </p>            <p>      All right, you buy the part about the wasps, but what is      this corn-signaling-for-help nonsense?    </p>    <p>      According to researchers Ted Turlings, Ph.D., and James      Tumlinson, Ph.D., of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in      Gainesville, Florida, corn emits a distress chemical, or      turpenoid, when it senses caterpillar saliva. (Call it the      "spit factor.") Wasps then pick up the turpenoid's scent      and fly over to save the day.    </p>    <p>      The two researchers are currently trying to figure out why      the corn reacts to the caterpillar's saliva. They are also      rearing wasps in the laboratory and "teaching" them to read      the corn's distress signal. Turlings and Tumlinson have      developed a synthetic blend (similar to the turpenoid) that      not only attracts wasps, but also poisons caterpillars and      acts as an antibiotic against fungus and bacteria.    </p>    <p>      Turlings and Tulinson hope that one day farmers will sic      'em on cornfields by the swarm.    </p>    <h3>Bug-Eatin' Lawn Ornaments</h3>       <p>      Peacocks aren't just proud, they can be downright arrogant.      Perhaps they have the regal appearance to pull it off, but      nice garb shouldn't grant the right to cast looks.    </p>    <p>      So who'd want one for a pet?    </p>    <p>      According to farmers Debra Buck and Dennis Fett, you might.    </p>    <p>      The married couple operates the largest peacock farm in the      nation, selling over 1,000 peafowl-hatching eggs a year.      They believe the peacock is the organic bug control of the      '90s. Peafowl will eat the bugs eating your vegetables and      the worms eating your apples. They're also easy to care for      since they eat the same foods as most poultry (although      they should also be given a game-bird food containing 30      percent protein).    </p>    <p>      If you can see it all now-beautiful lawn ornaments dining      on unwanted pests hold up; there are still a few      considerations you should mull over. For one thing, peafowl      frequently snack on flowers and garden vegetables. Broccoli      and cabbage seem to top their list. In fact, Buck and Fett      suggest gardeners grow extra vegetables to compensate for      the inevitable loss. Peafowl also have a rather strange cry      that resembles the sound of someone screaming "help!" :      This maybe somewhat disconcerting for you and your family,      and down right traumatic for your neighbors.    </p>    <p>      Let's take Rolling Hills Estates, California, for instance.      Last year, when bands of wild India blue peafowl suddenly      began roaming around community neighborhoods, residents      nearly went berserk. The ingrate peafowl took it upon      themselves to feast lavishly on vegetable gardens, relieve      themselves on residential properties, and scream wildly at      indecent hours of the night. Eventually community members      became so fed up with the birds that city officials phoned      Dennis Fett and offered him $200 plus expenses to figure      out a solution. Fett agreed, and spent several sleepless      nights determining ways to help out. He then flew to      California and spent four days outlining alternatives and      offering his suggestions to the town.    </p>    <p>      One of Fett's ideas was to develop a foundation that would      organize the care and nurturing of the peafowl, using      homeowners' associations to handle the peafowl problems and      protect community plants from hungry birds. He also threw      in some survival tips to make life more tolerable, such as:      1) avoid planting plants that peafowl like or put up a soft      mesh screen around those garden vegetables, 2) avoid      chemical pesticides, since peafowl also feed on bugs-the      more they eat bugs, the less they'll eat gardens, and 3)      hide your kitty's food bowl. Peafowl adore cat food.    </p>    <p>      As for the raucous noises, Fett told residents that they'd      better get used to it. There's just no way to keep a      peacock from screaming. (Well, no humane way).    </p>    <p>      So, weigh all of your pros and cons, and if you decide to      buy one (females are peahens; males are peacocks; babies      are peachicks), check with your city or county codes to      ensure poultry may be kept, and then look for a good      breeder. For more information, a price list (hatching egg      prices range from $4 to $50), or their books/newsletter,      write to: The Iowa Peacock Farmers, Debra Buck and Dennis      Fett, R.R.1, ME, Minden, Iowa 51553.    </p>    <h3>Some Cyanide in Your Soil?</h3>    <p>      Bad news for country dwellers. Big mining corporations are      blowing the tops off mountains from Iowa to Washington, and      it's not coal they're after. It's gold. When they're going      for coal, they at least have to clean up their mess-not so      with gold.    </p>    <p>      Here's the real kicker: most companies use <em>cyanide</em>      to separate the gold from the ore it's found in. Then, when      they're finished mining they just, well ...leave it there.      Unsuspecting animals fall victim to its nasty effects when      they drink from cyanide pools. It also seeps into the      ground, where sunlight can't break it down, and then enters      the aquifer (underground water source). When ingested in      large amounts, cyanide can be fatal.    </p>    <p>      You can blame this fiasco on the mining law that Congress      passed in 1872-the same law that coaxed starry-eyed gold      diggers to stampede California, dynamite in hand. The law      basically says anyone can mine anywhere, anytime, for      anything, and never mind the mess. So mining companies are      buying up hundreds of acres of National Forest land.    </p>    <p>      And don't think private land is exempt. Mining companies      make offers that many can't refuse. They'll pay Mr. Jones      for permission to search his land. So you'll never know      when Mr. Jones' tomato patch will be blown to bits. And      this could depreciate <em>your</em> property's value.    </p>    <p>      Take for instance the small town of Chesaw, Washington,      where Battlemountain Gold is all set to blast nearby      Buckhorn Mountain. We're talking about a 100-acre open pit      and 500 acres of dumped waste rock and tailings, soggy with      aresenic. Locals are scared silly. Not to mention the fact      that mines endanger bears, wolves, and lynx by poisoning      their drinking water.    </p>    <p>      Knowing full-well that they pose these threats, mining      companies sweet-talk opposition with the promise of new      jobs.    </p>    <p>      Over-zealous community residents often catch      building-fever, in anticipation of the mines bringing in      new business. "People start building with visions of a huge      windfall," says Jim Goettler, member of the Washington      Commision for Responsible Mining.    </p>    <p>      Problem is, once all of the gold's gone, the companies then      clear out, taking all the hands-on mining jobs and revenue      with them. All they leave behind are a bunch of tacky      mini-malls. Of course, these companies don't contribute one      red cent towards the communities landfills, schools, or      fire departments.    </p>    <p>      All these negative side effects have rural residents down      in the mouth-but they are not powerless, Goettler says. You      can gather together, do some foot stomping, and attack the      1872 Mining Act. Then badger Congress to amend mining      legislation at the state level. After ripping up your land      and dousing it with cyanide, the very least miners can do      is clean up their mess.    </p>    <p>      Editor's note: If you have interesting, timely, or even      peculiar news items you'd like to share with Mother      readers, please send it to "Bits e'r Pieces," Mother Earth      News, P.O.
