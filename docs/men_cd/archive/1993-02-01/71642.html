            		 <p>HERBALIST'S NOTEBOOK</p>        <p><strong>      Take care of your common colds or flu with herbs.    </strong></p>    <h5 id="byline">By Corinne Martin</h5>         <p>      Every year, knowing what the winter brings, I combine a      little Solomon seal with some honey to make a cough syrup.      The taste is woodsy-spiry, and even the kids think it's      delicious-well at least for a medicine. We use it to      relieve congestion and minor coughs, and we count on it to      get us through the bitter season of colds and flu.    </p>    <p>      Description: The Solomon seals are members of the lily      family, and while there are numerous varieties, two of them      are used medicinally: Smooth Solomon seal <em>(Polygonatum      biflorum)</em> and false Solomon seal <em>(Smilacena      racemas).</em> These can be used interchangeably. Both      plants favor forested areas and grow in dry or damp woods      or at the edges of forest along the sides of roads and      paths. They are also planted in perennial or woodland      gardens for ornamental purposes.    </p>    <p>      The roots of both types of Solomon seal are similar; they      are marked with round scars or "seals" where a leaf stalls      has broken away from the root. However, in the smooth      Solomon seal, roots tend to be a bit darker, a golden-cream      color, and have heavier, knobbier seals than the false      Solomon seal. Both plants have broad, lance-shaped leaves      along a single arched stem. These leaves grow up to six      inches long, are alternate in both species, and have      distinct parallel veins. Solomon seals may grow up to three      feet in height.    </p>    <p>      In the smooth Solomon seal, the leaves are smooth on both      the surface and underneath. The blossoms appear from each      leaf axil, dangling underneath the leaf pair. Blossoms are      small, up to 2/3" in length, and are bell-shaped, with six      flaring lobes at the tip. The flowers, which occur in      clusters of two, are pale greenish-white. Look for the      herb's blossoms in late spring and early summer.    </p>    <p>      The fruit, a dark bluish-black berry, develops from the      dangling flowers and hangs from the same leaf axils,      generally in pairs. The berries are suspended from a thin      green stalk, and occasionally the plant can be found with      the stalks, even after the berries have dropped off.    </p>    <p>      In the false Solomon seal, leaves are somewhat hairy along      the margins and on the undersurfaces. The blossoms occur in      a branched cluster at the terminal end of the stem, which      is triangular in shape. Flowers are just 1/8" long, with      three ivory or white petals.    </p>    <p>      Fruit appears first as a translucent green berry with pale,      brownish-red speckles. As they mature, the berries become      bright translucent red. The fruit occurs in clusters at the      terminal end of the stem, and the cluster forms a pyramidal      or triangular shape, much like the flower cluster.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Medicinal Uses:</strong>     The Solomon seals are both demulcent and expectorant. They      help soften mucus in the respiratory system, which is an      important step in preventing congestion from causing an      infection. In their function as expectorants, the Solomon      seals also help move mucus upward, making it easier to      expel it out of the body. These two actions help keep      symptoms of mild respiratory congestion from becoming a      serious cold or flu.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Harvesting:</strong> Dig roots of the Solomon seals      only after frosts have killed the foliage and the leaves      are brown and withered. Unearth the root, and wash      carefully. Slice into thin pieces and spread to dry; store      when all moisture has been removed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dosages:</strong>       Combine one teaspoon of dried root and 1 1/2 cups of      boiling water; simmer for five to 10 minutes. Drink three      times daily for relief of symptoms. Or simmer the dried      root in equal its weight in honey to produce a syrup. Heat      must be kept low so as not to destroy the medicinal      properties. Drink 1/2 to one teaspoon of this syrup three      to four times daily.    </p>        <p>      <em>After bringing home wintergreen, l spread it on the      table and pick through it, throwing out bug bitten or      imperfect leaves. The healthiest leaves go into a quart      jar, and I pour rubbing alcohol over them to make a      wintergreen liniment. I store the jar on a shelf in the      herb cabinet, where it can set for a couple of weeks. I put      the rest of the leaves on screens to dry out, which 1 will      use to make wintergreen tea. This tea is not only      delicious, but also healing.</em>    </p>    <p>      Description: Wintergreen is a low growing, perennial      evergreen found in hard wood or conifer forests. It has      aromatic leaves and fruit, and is often seen as the shiny      green undergrowth in woodlands; you can often find it under      snow in winter.    </p>    <p>      The wintergreen's leaves grow in an alternate fashion but      appear as a whorl atop a stiff branch, rising from the      creeping stem that trails at ground level. Leaves are oval      or egg-shaped, and a bit longer than they are wide-up to      two inches in length, and dull underneath. The margins are      slightly toothed, and leaves may turn maroon or dark red      when exposed to sunlight or hit by a sudden frost.    </p>    <p>      The wintergreen's bell-shaped flowers are white or      pinkish-white. They are composed of a five-lobed corolla      with a constricted tip, and five small teeth that flare out      from the lobes. Blossoms, about 1/4" to 1/3" long, hang in      loose nodding clusters from leaf axils. They are most often      found underneath the leaves, hanging in groups of one to      three blossoms, although some plants bear more. Look for      blossoms during the spring through early summer.    </p>    <p>      The fruit, a bright crimson berry, can be found on the      plant in fall through winter and into the following spring.      This edible berry has a strong minty flavor, and is      somewhat mealy in texture.    </p>    <p>      Medicinal Uses: Wintergreen's primary medicinal property is      methyl salicylate, the basic compound of aspirin. The      plant, analgesic and astringent, is used internally or      externally to help relieve pain.    </p>    <p>      Externally, liniment of the herb can be applied to      arthritic or rheumatic joint inflammations where it may      help reduce pain and irritation. The liniment can also be      used for strained or sore muscles; apply along with a      gentle massage to relieve aching.    </p>    <p>      Internally, wintergreen tea can be taken for general relief      of minor pains. It may be helpful for headaches, in the      discomfort of arthritis or rheumatism, or in muscle aches      and pains after strenuous exercise. Since wintergreen is      also diuretic and antiseptic, it can be taken internally      for mild bladder irritations; wintergreen can help increase      the flow of urine while easing the pain associated with the      condition.    </p>    <p>      The oil of wintergreen, which can be purchased from an herb      or health food store, can provide relief for irritated      teeth and gums. However, it is highly concentrated; use      sparingly.    </p>    <p>      Harvesting: Gather wintergreen when the plant is in bloom,      and select only the healthiest-looking leaves. (Pluck      leaves from several branches.) Once you get them home,      spread the leaves out on screens, paper bags, or baskets,      and keep them out of the sun. Because the leaves are      somewhat fleshy, the wintergreen leaves may take longer      than other plants to dry. You will know the plant is ready      to store when a leaf snaps easily between your fingers.    </p>    <p>      Dosages: For wintergreen tea, combine one to two teaspoons      of the leaves for every cup of boiling water. Cover and let      mixture steep for 10 to 15 minutes, and drink three times a      day for pain relief or to help bladder irritations. If you      are using the oil of wintergreen for painful teeth      irritations, place a drop on your finger and apply      externally to the affected tooth and gum. Apply three or      four times daily.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's note: Corinne Martin, a graduate of the      Institute of Traditional Herbal Medicine in Santa Fe,      NM,</em> <em>is</em> <em>a certified clinical herbalist who      has studied plants for over a decade.
