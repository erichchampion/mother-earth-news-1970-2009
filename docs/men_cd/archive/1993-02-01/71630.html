            		<p> NATURAL HEALTH</p>        <p>      <strong>Don't get stuck with cabin fever, make simple      recipes that'll allow you to get out.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Anne Vassal    </h5>        <p>      This is the time of year when cabin fever manifests itself      in epidemic proportions in the Midwest. We spend a good      portion of our day within those four walls at work, only to      return home to another set of all too familiar walls. The      sky is an eternal gray mass, the weather's nasty, and the      only fresh thing in the refrigerator is the mold on the      oranges. We may choose to wallow in misery under the covers      watching old westerns, or defy the weather and break out of      the house. But in order to go tobogganing, bargain hunting,      or museum hopping, we must have something hot and appealing      on the stove to welcome our return home, and it had better      be simple or we'll never escape those four walls.    </p>    <p>      I never knew the true meaning of cabin fever until we lived      on a farm in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I was often      snowed in for four to five days at a time with an 18month      old baby and my husband away on business. My only social      interaction consisted of babbling broken English with a      toddler and chatty monologues delivered to two old horses      over the feed trough. When I finally did get to the nearest      town five miles away, food selection was limited at the      solitary grocery store. At that time of year, the only      fresh vegetable available was soggy gray-green celery. I      was pressured into culinary creativity-using soggy celery,      a cellar full of root vegetables, and whatever was in the      deep freeze. Amazingly enough, some terrific smelling stews      and chili were conceived on the woodburning cook stove. The      stove warmed the kitchen while the stews warmed our      innards. I learned that winter that our bodies are adaptive      to seasonal eating. We aren't going to suffer nutritionally      after a winter of consuming root vegetables.    </p>    <p>      The recipes below use winter vegetables that are readily      available and affordable. They require a minimum of both      preparation and cleanup (note: using a food processor will      speed things up considerably).    </p>    <h3>Borscht Stew</h3>      <p>      This stew is a beautiful red color and I've found it is the      only way my family will eat beets. Traditional borscht has      sliced cabbage in it. If you wish to add some to this      recipe, just omit the celery. Borscht can be made without      meat, but I cut some some beef into small pieces and throw      that in for flavor <em>to 1 pound beef stew meat, cut into      small pieces</em>    </p>    <p>      •<em>1/4 cup flour, whole wheat or white</em><br />      •<em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em><br />      •<em>4 cloves garlic, minced<br />      •</em> <em>5 cups water</em> <em><br />      •2 medium onions, cut into bite-size chunks</em>      <em><br />      •4 to 5 carrots (2 1/2 cups), cut into half-inch      chunks</em> <em><br />      •4 to 5 small white or red potatoes (2 cups), cut into      chunks</em> <em><br />      •3 turnips, quartered and sliced thin</em> <em><br />      •4 to 5 beets (4 cups)</em> <em><br />      •3 stalks celery (1 1/2 cups), cut into half-inch      chunks</em> <em><br />      •1/2</em> <em>cup tomato paste</em> <em><br />      •3 tablespoons cider vinegar</em> <em><br />      •1 tablespoon honey</em> <em><br />      •1 tablespoon brown sugar</em> <em><br />      •1 teaspoon dried basil</em> <em><br />      •1 teaspoon ground paprika teaspoon ground cayenne      pepper</em> <em>salt and freshly ground pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Optional:</strong> chopped parsley, low-fat      yogurt, or "lite" sour cream</em>    </p>    <p>      Put meat chunks and flour in plastic bag and shake in order      to coat meat. Heat the oil on medium-high in a large stew      pot; add meat. Brown for two to three minutes, but don't      let burn. Add garlic and saute for a minute or so. De-glaze      the pan with the five cups of water. Cover and simmer on      low for 30 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Add remaining ingredients (except celery) and cook for 30      more minutes. Then add celery and simmer for another 30      minutes or so until vegetables are just done, stirring as      needed. Add salt, pepper, and additional water.    </p>    <p>      Serve stew topped with a combination of low-fat yogurt,      "lite" sour cream, and chopped parsley.    </p>    <p>      There's nothing better than coming home after a full day of      sledding, and having a nice warm meal to welcome you back.    </p>        <h3>Penne Pasta with Pork</h3>      <p>      To cut down on fat, I use pork instead of the conventional      Italian sausage. To guarantee that the ground pork I use      isn't fatty, I buy pork stew meat, freeze it slightly, and      then grind it in the food processor.    </p>    <p>      •<em>3/4 cup ground pork</em><br />      •<em>1 teaspoon olive oil</em><br />      •<em>2 large cloves garlic, minced</em><br />      •<em>1 large onion, chopped</em><br />      •<em>2 cups celery,<br />      •chopped</em> <em>1/2 cup red pepper, chopped into      thin strips, then chopped in half</em><br />      •<em>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</em><br />      • <em>1/2 teaspoon oregano</em> <em><br />      •1 1/2 teaspoon basil teaspoon fennel seed</em><br />      • <em>16 ounces canned tomatoes with juice</em>      <em><br />      •4 tablespoons tomato paste</em><br />      •<em>1 teaspoon red wine vinegar salt and freshly      ground pepper</em><br />      •<em>4 cups uncooked penne pasta grated parmesan or      romano cheese chopped parsley</em>    </p>    <p>      Fry pork in olive oil in a non-stick skillet until browned.      Add garlic and onion; saute for a few minutes. Add celery,      red pepper, spices, tomatoes, tomato paste, and vinegar.      Cook uncovered on medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes.      Meanwhile, boil water for the pasta and then cook it until      done, but not mushy. Drain the pasta well and stir into the      meat mixture. Top this meal with parmesan cheese and sprigs      of parsley.    </p>    <h3>Lentil Chili</h3>    <p>      This vegetarian chili is faster to prepare than standard      chili because lentils cook quickly. Since lentils are a      drab color, top this dish with some grated cheddar cheese,      red or green onions, and fresh cilantro or parsley.    </p>    <p>      <br />      •<em>4 cloves garlic, minced</em><br />      •<em>2 medium onions, chopped</em><br />      •<em>1 small jalapeno or cayenne pepper,      minced</em><br />      •<em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em><br />      •<em>3 cups brown lentils</em><br />      •<em>6 cups water</em><br />      •<em>2 teaspoons ground cumin</em><br />      •<em>1 teaspoon ground coriander</em><br />      •<em>2 teaspoons chili powder</em><br />      •<em>1 teaspoon paprika</em><br />      •<em>1/2 teaspoon allspice</em><br />      •<em>1/2 teaspoon thyme</em><br />      •<em>3/4 cup tomato paste</em><br />      •<em>1 small can V-8 or tomato juice</em><br />      •<em>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</em><br />      •<em>1 teaspoon sugar</em><br />      •<em>1 large red pepper, chopped</em><br />      •<em>2 stalks celery, chopped</em><br />      •<em><strong>Toppings:</strong> sour cream, grated      cheese, red or green onion, cilantro or parsley.</em>    </p>    <p>      Saute garlic, onion, and hot pepper in oil. Add lentils,      water and spices. Simmer for 25 to 30 minutes in a covered      pot until the lentils are tender. Add tomato paste, juice,      vinegar, sugar, red pepper, and celery. Add salt, pepper      and additional water if needed. Simmer for another 15 to 20      minutes until vegetables are tender. Serve plain or over      brown rice or pasta.    </p>    <h3>Guner's Lamb Stew</h3>     <p>      My Turkish stepfather's says the same thing everytime he      cooks: "Lots of garlic and olive oil-it will be fantastic."      And it is, but I've cut down on both here-you can add more      if you wish.    </p>    <p>      •<em>2 tablespoons olive oil</em><br />      •<em>2 medium onions, cut into bite-size      chunks</em><br />      •<em>1 teaspoon ground cumin</em><br />      • <em>1 teaspoon paprika</em><br />      •<em>1/4</em><em>teaspoon each: ground allspice,      cardamon, ginger, cinnamon</em><br />      •<em>1/2</em> <em>teaspoon garam masala*      (optional)</em><br />      •<em>5 cloves garlic, minced</em><br />      •<em>1 pound lamb, cut into bite-size chunks, trimming      all fat</em><br />      •<em>1 small jalapeno pepper, minced, seeds      removed</em><br />      •<em>3 cups water</em><br />      •<em>1</em> <em>tablespoon tomato paste</em><br />      •<em>1 teaspoon tamari (mild soy sauce)</em><br />      •<em>1 tablespoon brown sugar</em><br />      •<em>2 bay leaves</em><br />      •<em>5 small carrots, cut into half- inch      chunks</em><br />      •<em>1/</em> <em>2 pound green beans, cut into 1 inch      pieces</em><br />      •<em>1 to 2 skinned tomatoes, chopped into ;inch      chunks</em><br />      •<em>salt and freshly ground pepper</em><br />      •<em><strong>*</strong> Can be purchased at an Asian      or Indian grocery store.</em>    </p>    <p>      Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in large pot. Saute onion      and spices until almost all of the oil disappears. Add      second tablespoon of oil. Then add lamb, garlic, and hot      pepper. Saute, stirring constantly, until lamb releases its      moisture and reabsorbs it. Pour in water, cover; simmer.      After 30 minutes, add tomato paste, tamari, sugar, bay      leaves, and carrots. Let simmer. After 20 minutes, add      green beans and tomatoes. Simmer. After 10 minutes (or when      cooked), add salt and pepper. Serve over noodles or mashed      potatoes. Top with fresh parsley.    </p>
