                <p>      HANDWORKS    </p>        <p>      <strong>Make your own giant afghan to curl up in this      winter.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Ella Jean Earl    </h5>        <p>      <em>Outside, snow is swirling to the</em> <em>ground,</em>      <em>adding an unknown number of inches to</em> <em>the      crusty snow left over from the last</em> <em>storm.</em>      <em>Wrapped in my shawl, I collect another</em> <em>armful      of wood for the hungry stove, and</em> <em>wonder if you're      enjoying the shawl you</em> <em>made from last issue's      pattern. Hopefully,</em> <em>it has started to become a      part</em> of <em>your</em> <em>every</em> <em>day life.      You've probably even discovered</em> <em>some new uses for      it that I hadn't mentioned. I'm sure you feel proud of your      ac</em> <em>complishment, so let's forge ahead and</em>      <em>make a new project...</em>    </p>    <p>      Now that you have the tools, ability, and most important,      the confidence to create more handwork, I want to share a      pattern with you that boasts versatility. This one pattern      can be used to create endless variations. After all, when      you decorate with crocheted items, there are no rules; your      imagination is the only limitation. So be daring: try      different color combinations and make different sizes. Your      hook flies, the colors blend, and the thread melds into a      beautiful new creation. Once you get started making      homespun items, your house will never look the same.    </p>    <p>      Arranging these handmade pieces throughout your home will      not only give it a warm and welcome feeling, but will      literally keep your family and friends warm. As you add      your creations to a plain room, you can watch the room      transform into a country garden of simple elegance. Just by      using the colors of your choice, you can actually change a      room's atmosphere-you may even find your mood uplifting as      you enter a room.    </p>    <p>      What better way to start adding colorful ac cents to your      home than with a beautiful afghan? This colorful blanket,      fashioned from yarn, is crocheted or knitted from strips or      squares. The most traditional version is the granny-square      afghan. It's easy to do, but gives a finished look that      will leave people raving. Make one to throw on the back of      your couch so you can wrap it around yourself while      watching a movie or reading a good book. Or leave it folded      at the end of your bed so you'll be ready when you need      some extra warmth on frosty evenings.    </p>    <p>      One of the best parts about crocheting an afghan is that      you can pass it down through generations-unless of course      your afghan meets the same fate of the one I made over 20      years ago. My daughters' old tom cat (appropriately named      "Tom") would frequently pull the black, red, orange, and      yellow afghan off the back of the couch, curl up in it, and      fall right asleep. One morning I took it up to refold it      and found several gnawed holes. Although I repaired it, he      found it and took his teeth and claws to it again. For the      next few weeks, no matter where I put the ill-fated afghan,      Tom would find the darn thing-until there was no mending      left to do. The reason for this afghan obsession evades me;      I'm just thankful that Tom only craved this one project,      since all the other crocheted items are left untouched.    </p>    <p>      Pillows are another colorful addition to any room. Toss      them on chairs, couches, and the family room floor (kids      love hanging out on giantfloor pillows). Covering couch      pillows that have seen better days is a good way to bring      new life to those you thought were ready for the dump. And      don't forget the bedroom; to me, a bouquet of crocheted      pillows displayed on a bed is like having a summer garden      year-round.    </p>    <p>      Perk up your kitchen with bright coasters, pot holders,      placemats, and chair pads. One granny square makes a      coaster, two squares (with quilted material sandwiched in      between for padding) makes a pot holder, 12 small squares      sewn together will make useful placemats, nine medium-size      squares will make durable chair pads for your kitchen      chairs. How about a welcome mat or scatter rug? Use two or      three strands of four-ply yarn held together to make a      thick, heavy rug. Working with several different colors      held together gives a tweed-type look. Sew a piece of heavy      burlap on your rug to make it more durable, and then glue      some rubber strips on the bottom to make the rug nonskid.      By using coordinating colors, you'll pull your new      accessories together for a finished look.    </p>    <p>      You can either make colorful granny squares by using a      different color for each round or by using three different      colors for the first three rounds and same color for every      fourth round. For example, use three vibrant colors for the      first three rounds and then black for the fourth. Using      black for your background will make the colors even more      striking; using a different color for every round will      create a virtual rainbow. Or work round after round with      one color until you're bored with it, then change to      whatever new color inspires you. You can make the afghan as      large as you like; just keep crocheting until you feel the      size is right.    </p>    <p>      My Gramma kept an old steamer trunk filled with granny      squares. As a child, I would often spend some of my summer      vacation with her. When I was bored, Gramma would send me      to her "treasure chest" (that's what she called her steamer      trunk), and I would pick out "grannies" and spend hours      making different projects. Soon the day was spent and it      would be time to fix supper. There never seemed to be a      lack of things to do at Gramma's, and I always had      something that I made to bring home with me. As I got      older, Gramma showed me how to make my own grannies. That's      when I began my "treasure chest:" I don't have a steamer      trunk yet, but I do have my own version: a wicker laundry      basket. My daughters, Delilah and Violet, are competent      granny-square makers too, and we are constantly making more      grannies to replace used ones, so we always have a      substantial supply on-hand.    </p>                               <h3>      Figure Instructions    </h3>    <p>      Figures 1, 2, 3: Rnd 1: ch 6, join last ch to first with a      slip stitch to form a ring. Ch 3 to count as first dc, work      2 more do in ring, ch 2 for corner. Figure 4: Work 3 dc, ch      2, until you have a total of 4 groups. Join with sl st into      top of starting ch 3 Figure 5: Rnd 2: Join new color in any      ch 2 corner space. Ch 3 for first dc. Note: To continue      working with the same color, sl st over the 3 do and in the      ch-2 corner, then ch-3 for first dc. Figure 6: In same      corner, work 2 dc, ch 2 3 dc. *Ch 1, in next ch 2 corner      space work 3 dc, ch 2, 3 do to make another corner. Repeat      from " twice more, ch 1, join with sl st into top of      starting ch 3. Figure 7: Rnd 3: Join new color in any ch 2      corner (or if using the same color, sl st to the ch 2      corner space.) Ch 3 for first dc, 2 dc, ch 2, 3 do for      corner. Ch 1, work 3 do in ch 1 space, ch 1, work another      corner as before. Continue around the squares in this      fashion until all four sides are completed. Join with sl st      into top of starting ch 3. You've completed three rounds.    </p>    <p>      You can involve your own kids by letting them sew squares      together. Just give them the basic directions and then let      them create. You may be surprised at the original      inventions they come up with. My sons, Alexander and      Demetrius, made wonderful presents for Grandparent's Day.      Alexander made an eyeglass case for his Grampa, using four      squares and some felt as lining. Demetrius used two      squares, felt for lining, and polyfill stuffing to create a      pincushion for Gramma. Of course their grandparents were      delighted and gushed over the boys' accomplishments.    </p>    <p>      You can ask your whole family to participate in the crochet      projects you embark on. Choosing colors is enjoyable, and      even more so when it's a family decision (especially if it      will be used in the family room). Select yarn in your      children's favorite colors and make an afghan with matching      pillows. Your labor of love will be a special keepsake for      years to come.    </p>    <h3>      GIANT GRANNY-SQUARE AFGHAN    </h3>    <p>      Size: About 60" square.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Materials:</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <br />      •4 ply worsted weight yarn<br />      • 3 skeins black<br />      • 2 skeins each: white, dark red, royal blue, forest      green, sunny yellow, deep purple, and lavender<br />      Size I aluminum crochet hook    </p>    <p>      <strong>Color Pattern</strong>    </p>    <p>      •<strong>Rod 1 through 6:</strong> Arranging colors as      desired, work each round in a different bright color.<br />      •<strong>Rnds 7 and 8:</strong> Work in black. •<strong>Rnd      9:</strong> Work in white.<br />•<strong>Rnds 10 and 11:</strong>      Work in black.<br />•<strong>Rnds 12-23:</strong> Work each round      in a different bright color.<br />•<strong>Rnds 24-28:</strong>      Repeat rounds 7 through 11.<br />•<strong>Rnds 29-40:</strong>      Work each round in a different bright color.<br />•<strong>Rnds      41-45:</strong> Repeat rounds 7 through 11.</p><p>•<strong>AFGHAN:      Ch 6,</strong> join with sl st to form ring.<br />•<strong>Rnd      1:</strong> Ch 3 for first dc, work 2 do in ring, ch 2 for      corner, (3 do in ring, ch 2) 3 times, join with sl st to      top of starting chi.

Sew squares together working through one      or both loops as desired. For a smoother edge, work 2 rnds      of sc around entire afghan.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TIPS</strong></p><p>•Variegated yarn is a lot of fun to      work with when making the baby or the giant granny afghan.      The color changes for you as you work, which makes a nice      pattern without cutting and joining new colors. <br />•Put a drop      of clear fingernail polish on knots and let it dry in order      to seal them.<br />•For a more finished look, work a single      crochet evenly around the outside edge or work in double      crochet for a different look.<br />•For pillows and afghans, you      may add fringe at the corners or all the way around.<br />•Wash      your crocheted item using the directions on the label of      the skein of yarn.    </p>    <h3>      Not Just for Winter    </h3>    <p>      With Spring around the corner and warm weather on the way,      it's a good time to mention that crocheting isn't just for      winter. However, it isn't the time to put away your crochet      hook; it's time to learn how to make things with a finer      thread called "crochet cotton:" This cotton, which looks      like string and comes in a variety of colors, can be      purchased in different weights (which actually means that      they come in different plys, like yarn). So start thinking      about doing projects that you can easily carry along during      the busy summer months.    </p>    <p>      One of my favorite items to make is dishclothes (no      kidding!). When people hear that the colorful item that I'm      fashioning is a dishcloth, and will be used to wipe up pots      and pans, they say "What! It's way too pretty to use for      something like that:" Well, maybe they think so, but I have      never owned a storebought dishcloth that lasted near as      long as my handmade ones. In fact, the storebought ones      usually end up thrown in our barn rag-bag. Handmade      dishclothes clean better and you may even find that you      don't need to use brillo pads, which often take the finish      right off of your pans and kettles, and also hurt the      environment.    </p>    <p>      To make a dishcloth, use crochet cotton, a small size steel      or aluminum hook, and the exact same pattern for the granny      square listed in the article. Keep crocheting until the      square becomes whatever size you like.    </p>    <p>      In addition, you may want to make a bunch of small accent      doilies to place around your home. All you have to do is      sew a few small granny squares together so that they'll fit      your end tables, or drape them gracefully on the back of a      couch or chair.    </p>
