            			<p>SPRING GARDEN    </p>		    <p>      Build and plant the bed that will provide shade, juicy      tomatoes, and a little extra<br />      income.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Timothy M. Clapsaddle    </h5>        <p>      Tam an organic farmer who subscribes to the utilitarian in      building design-especially when it comes to gardening. The      simple, inexpensive project below not only provides food      and income, but also the comfort and energy savings from      the vast shading it offers. Believe me, living in a small      home with little insulation on a somewhat spartan income      has been a most powerful motivation. My only regret is not      building this ecosystem 10 years ago, when this old house      had no air conditioning. The whole project will cost you      $75, and by selling your delicious home-growns, you'll more      than make up for the cost.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Building the Frame</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Materials:<br /></em> -roll of plastic<br />      -50' x 5' roll of 2" x 4" wire fencing<br />      -small roll of bailing wire<br />      -12 large washers and screws<br />      Tools:<br />      -wire cutters<br />      -screwdriver (cordless drill)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Construction Method</strong>    </p>    <p>      Start by spreading out a cheap roll of plastic around the      base of your house for protection (it will be in direct      contact with the tomato bed). By placing plastic between      the ground and the bed, you will also keep the tomato roots      from reaching non-organic residues such as lead-based      paints. You may want to attach the house-side fencing edge      to furring strips that are securely fastened to your house      frame. Make sure that your gutter system is in good working      order; the rain run off from your roof may be too much for      your plants. This could cause tomato-cracking and soil      nutrient wash-out. A couple of 55-gallon drums      strategically placed to catch this run-off will ensure an      ample supply of relatively pure water for your tomatoes.      (If any of you have roofs that are coated with lead,      consider the possibilities of toxins running off with rain      water.) Each plant requires approximately two gallons      weekly.    </p>    <p>      Next, choose a wall facing south, or even better-west.      Contrary to popular opinion, tomatoes do better with some      shade; they live longer and the fruit is tastier. Clear an      area several yards away, along the length of this wall.      Unroll the fencing along the length of it, placing a few      bricks as you roll to keep the wire from recoiling. Next,      pull up the fencing's edge (nearest your house) and attach      it to the wall at a 24" height using screws, large washers,      and your screwdriver. Space screws every four to five feet      along the entire length of the wall. Then pull up the      outside edge, securing the opposing edges together with      baling wire and leaving a 12"-wide opening. Of course, you      may vary these dimensions according to your needs and the      particular layout of your home.    </p>    <p>      The basket-type bed you've just created will conform      dimensionally to the weight of the growing medium, becoming      wider and more cylindrical at the base. The ends of the bed      are enclosed by cutting off the last vertical strand of the      outer edge and then bending and securing the edges together      with the exposed horizontal strands. Remember, the ground      is to support the weight of the soil medium, not the house      fastening points!    </p>        <p>      <strong>Filling the Basket (with organic growing      medium)</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Materials:</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      -6 to 10 bales of wheat straw (note: wood chips, hay, or      plastic may be used for the basket liner). The straw may be      more<br />      expensive, but the others do not keep pests away or allow      air circulation of the roots and/or water drainage that is      essential<br />      for intensive gardening.    </p>    <p>      -50 to 100 cubic feet of partially composted cow manure      (equivalent to about two to four pickup-truck loads). I      bought my two<br />      loads at a local dairy farm for $10 each. This price even      included loading with a front-end loader.    </p>    <p>      -10 to 20 cubic feet of coarse sand (I purchased my load at      a local quarry for $10).    </p>    <p>      -5 to 10 pounds of bone-meal (provides the needed phosporus      that cow manure lacks).    </p>    <p>      -1 to 2 gallons of hard-wood ashes (provides potash).    </p>    <p>      Be sure to mix these ingredients well. The soil-medium      recipe is about as organic as you're going to get for a      reasonable<br />      price. My soil mixture resulted in a pH of 6.3, which is      near perfect for tomatoes (or just about any vegetable, for      that matter).<br />      Of course, this recipe can be tailored to your particular      circumstances. A mixture of sand, topsoil, and compost      should work<br />      well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Birdnesting</strong>    </p>    <p>      Using the straw, line the basket, starting at the basket's      floor, and interweave handfuls as you go, much as a lazy      bird would do. Build up the sides to a height of 5" or 6",      with a fluffy 3" to 4" inches in thickness, and fill to      height with the soil-medium. (Hopefully, you're able to      drive a pick-up alongside the bed, so you can shovel      directly into the back.) Repeat this process till you reach      the desired depth. (Mine is only 12" deep). Remember: you      can add more next year. Then cover the bed's surface with      three to four inches of straw.    </p>    <p>      The bed is now ready for your hardened tomato transplants.      If you're waiting for warmer weather to plant, you may want      to cover the bed with plastic in order to prevent any rain      run off of the soil's nutrients. This will also greatly      reduce the offensive odor that manure inherits for several      days.    </p>    <p>      There's not much else that compares with actually creating      what was once an idea. So have fun building, and change the      blueprints to suit your own imagination.    </p>    <p>      I planted 50 6" tomato plants in April of 1992 in this      manure-sand mixture. The manure was only a few days old and      didn't burn the plants at all. In fact, they thrived,      providing hundreds of pounds of healthy tomatoes-much more      than my family could consume. Use them fresh, in sauces, or      canned for the winter. Plus, I more than made up for the      initial money invested ($75) with my sales to restaurants,      grocery stores, and local neighbors.    </p>    <p>      My tomato foliage reached heights of more than 10',      covering the west side of our trailer and dramatically      lowered the temperature inside. We had no problem with      insects-inside or outside- except for my mate's fear of      spiders, which benevolently stayed outside trapping harmful      garden pests. A couple of dozen applications of cow manure      (a shovelful every couple of weeks per plants) seemed to      keep the pests away and helped feed the thriving      tomatoes-not to mention built up the bed to the proper      depth.    </p>    <p>      I made the trellis out of bamboo poles fastened together      with baling wire woven through V holes drilled through the      bamboo. Biodegradable jute string was perfect for tying the      ever-growing vines. I wish now that I had strung another      roll of fencing to the 4 x 4s cemented in the ground every      8' or so for a maintenance-free trellis; the jute string      was fairly expensive and the labor of stringing was a bit      time-consuming. I believe the fence trellis would provide      much better support after several years went by, and would      be cheaper than using the string as well.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to plant disease-resistant indeterminate varieties      according to your preference. My plants were spaced 12"      apart and did fine. No pruning was done until the end of      August. (Pruning doesn't increase the total yield.) In      fact, pruning encourages tomato-splitting from excessive      water (the extra foilage absorbs extra water) and provides      less shade. This fall I will add an extra 8" to 10" of      birdnesting and soil-medium. Next year's crop should be      even more bountiful.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Timothy Clapsaddle is an organic farmer      who is interested in making self-sufficient systems      affordable and user-friendly to people and the      environment.</em> Resources<br />    </p>    <p>      What are you going to do with all those extra tomatoes?
