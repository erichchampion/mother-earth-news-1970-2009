            		<p>SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</p>    		<h5 id="byline">By Greg and Pat Williams</h5>          <p>      You say you've been having a slugfest in your garden and      the organic slug remedies (like beer in saucers) aren't      working? Is it time to give up and reach for a chemical      poison? No! Recent English experiments have shown that      <em>aluminum sulfate,</em> a natural inorganic material      widely used to acidify soil, works as well as - or      even better than - the standard methiocarb and      metaldehyde slug molluscicides (mollusk toxins).      Furthermore, aluminum sulfate costs less than the synthetic      substances and is quite easy to apply.    </p>    <p>      In the British tests, all the molluscicides evaluated      - natural and synthetic - provided adequate      protection for four days, then slug damage began to recur.      Hence, frequent applications may be necessary. However,      since aluminum sulfate seems to act more as a repellent      than a poison, slug populations might take a long time to      build resistance to it.    </p>    <p>      Aluminum sulfate powder is sold at most garden centers as a      soil acidifier. Apply five to 10 pounds per 1,000 square      feet for slug control. (About 50 pounds per 1,000 square      feet is needed to lower pH a point - and you can      always add lime to bring pH back up. )    </p>   <h3>Research Briefs</h3>    <p>      <strong>Sterile Darrows.</strong> The Darrow is perhaps the      best thorny blackberry cultivar for the eastern U.S. But if      yours bear poorly or not at all, they may be victims of      <em>Darrow sterility disorder.</em> DSD seems to be      genetically based (even tissue-cultured plants can be      afflicted) and cannot be cured. So make sure your      blackberry suppliers obtain their propagation materials      only from highly fruitful plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Don't microwave test soil.</strong> University of      South Dakota researchers report that using a microwave oven      to dry soil test samples significantly alters the results      for organic matter content, pH, nitrogen, potassium, sulfur      and cation-exchange capacity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Low-mow lawn grass?</strong> Jan Wiejer, a      geneticist at the University of Alberta, has developed      several new grass cultivars - including fine fescues,      bluegrasses and wheatgrasses - that grow less than      six inches over an entire summer. However, some specialists      question whether the "miracle grasses" will work well in      the U.S.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Morels on the menu.</strong> That favorite of wild      mushroom foragers, the morel <em>(Morchella</em> species),      has finally been grown under artificial conditions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ants on the march</strong> don't like to cross a      freshly drawn line of - powdered chalk. We've tried      it (redrawing the line every few days and after rains), and      it really reduced aphid-herding activities on our trees.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Heat-beating lettuce.</strong> When we accidentally      "cooked" a greenhouse flat of lettuce seeds last spring,      all the starts died but Anuenue (a tasty, new,      heat-resistant variety available from Johnny's Selected      Seeds, Foss Hill Rd., Albion, ME 04910). This means Anuenue      is probably a good fall lettuce for areas with hot summers      (most other lettuces are hard to germinate in hot weather).    </p>        <p>      Biological brush control. Researchers in Vermont stocked a      brush-invaded hill pasture at densities of eight cattle, 32      sheep or 32 goats per five acres. After three years, the      cattle and sheep reduced the brush density by two-thirds.      The goats, though, <em>completely</em> wiped out invading      thorns, brush and trees in only two years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ready, set, grow!</strong> Currently, California      has the only major commercial grower of edible flowers for      the restaurant trade. We predict there will be dozens      within the next five years as the edible-flower fad spreads      eastward.    </p>   <h3>Gleanings</h3>    <p>      For a superb explanation of how trees respond to decay      - with practical advice on aiding damaged specimens      - read <em>Tree Defects: A Photo Guide</em> ($6.50      postpaid from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.      Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.

To help celebrate the      bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, the International      Society of Arboriculture and the National Arborist      Association have organized a program to find and honor U.S.      trees that are at least 200 years old (write John Duling,      P.O.
