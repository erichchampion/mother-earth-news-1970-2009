                    <p>      Confidence in your equipment can be a key to more      successful hunting trips.</p>			<h5 id="byline"> By Bruce Woods    </h5>        <p>      The hunter, curled fetuslike, presses down into the Space      Blanket that serves to separate him from the damp      depression overlooking the field. It's two hours into his      third and final day. The expectation that once helped keep      him still and silent, the absolute <em>belief</em> in deer,      has long gone. Nothing supports him in the face of      stiffness and cold, nothing fights off the nagging whispers      that say "quit," or "for God's sake, at least stand and      stretch" - nothing but the grim determination to go      out doing this right, to give no aid to an unfriendly fate.    </p>    <p>      Three hours. His body heat has melted the snow; wet fingers      stretch over the lip of the ground cover. He closes his      eyes against the internal taunts. When he opens them, three      bucks are walking stiff-legged into the field, a scant 100      yards distant.    </p>    <p>      No trouble with control now. The gun comes up to rest on      bent knees. A deep breath as the scope fills with deer, a      half breath out; the crosshairs drop and hold behind the      shoulder of the biggest, rest steady as the trigger creeps      toward the always surprising shot. <em>There!</em>    </p>    <p>      But the buck isn't down. The trio mill about in brief      confusion and then stretch toward a windrow of trees. He      sweeps the scope with them, less steady now, but still      vacillating within the area of clean kill. A second shot.      No tail drop, no sudden stumble or twitch, no sound of a      bullet strike.    </p>    <p>      He's on his feet now, aiming only at the middle of the big      buck's body. Shot. Shot. Shot. And the snicker of a firing      pin on an empty chamber. Loading on the run, he finds the      deep-driven tracks of panic, follows them to the woods. No      blood, no hair. <em>Five misses?</em>    </p>    <p>      A shell in the chamber, past believing anything now, he      takes a careful rest and aims at a stump-center knot 30      yards off. Steady, squeeze, and bark jumps a full six      inches high, three to the right. He looks down at the      expensive rifle, feeling betrayal and the slow spread of      guilt.    </p>    <p>      It was spot-on last season.    </p>    <h3>      Inciting a Sight-In    </h3>    <p>      Missed shots or, worse yet, poor shots that result in the      escape of a badly wounded animal can often be traced to      either improperly sighted rifles or firearms that have had      their sights jarred out of adjustment. Of course, the      <em>major</em> cause of poor shooting is a shortage of      hunter ability; no scope, regardless of how well it's      sighted-in, will compensate for a lack of familiarity with      the gun. The answer here is to practice, and then practice      some more.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, a scope that's out of adjustment can      frustrate the most experienced marksman. So take the time      to <em>check</em> a sighted-in rifle before each hunting      season (and then practice with it); do the same after      traveling to a distant hunt, or after a day in steep or      brushy country that could leave your rifle feeling the same      sort of knocks that can make a quiet evening in camp seem      like a little bit of heaven. More important still, never      assume that a newly purchased gun is right, whether bought      used or set up by sporting-goods store staff: You owe it to      yourself, and to the game you intend to hunt, to burn      enough powder to assure yourself that the job has been done      correctly.    </p>    <h3>      Begin With a Bore Sighter    </h3>        <p>      Although it's possible to do the job without a bore      sighter, I've come to consider this tool (Fig. 2)      indispensable when setting up a scoped firearm. This device      allows the rifleman, without even loading a shell, to align      the scope with the bore of the rifle. A boresighted firearm      will typically be "on the paper"-that is, it should      hit <em>somewhere</em> on a standard-sized rifle      target-at 100 yards. This can save a number of spent      shells during the adjustment process. It is, however, only      a preparation for final zeroing in.    </p>    <p>      To use a bore sighter, simply insert the appropriate rod      (several will come with the tool) into the muzzle of your      firearm, adjust the device until the calibrated lens is      centered in front of the rifle scope, then secure the bore      sighter in position by turning the knurled-head fitting to      expand the rod within the bore. Now look through the scope      toward a bright window or other source of light. The      calibrations on the bore sighter will be superimposed over      the crosshairs of the scope (Fig. 1). Simply adjust the      scope until its crosshairs are centered on the bore      sighter's checkerboard, and you'll have taken a giant step      toward straighter shooting .    </p>                <p>      <strong>Punching Paper</strong>    </p>    <p>      The final stage of the sighting-in process can best be      accomplished at a rifle range equipped with benches and      good gun rests. Failing that, make up a few small cloth      bags (about six inches square), stuff them with sand and      use them to rest the rifle on while shooting.    </p>        <p class="caption">      <strong>FIG.3 ZEROING IN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Set up a target at 100 yards if you're sighting-in a deer      rifle, or at 50 yards if you're using a .22. (If you're not      at a range, make absolutely certain that you've got a      <em>completely</em> <em>safe</em> backdrop behind your      target, such as a high, thick dirt bank.) Then -      wearing ear and eye protection - rest the gun      securely and squeeze off three careful shots at the center      of the target. The bullet holes should group at some point      on the target paper (Fig. 3). Measure the distance from the      middle of your grouping to the bull's eye, figuring first      the distance to the right or left of the target center      (windage) and then that above or below the bull      (elevation). Now adjust your sight or scope to compensate      for the error. To do so, you'll have to know how the      calibrations on the sight work. Many scopes adjust in      clicks, each one equaling a change in point of impact of      one inch at 100 yards. With the adjustment made, take      another three careful shots. Your group should now be      closer to the bull's eye. If it's not close enough to suit      you, repeat the measurement, adjustment and      three-shot-group process as many times as necessary; that      is, until the rifle is dead-on.    </p>    <p>      (Note: Many hunters sight-in deer rifles to shoot about two      inches high at 100 yards, thus enabling the shooter to keep      the impact point within a clean kill zone at longer ranges      without having to aim high to account for bullet drop.      Before doing this, check the ballistics of your      rifle-and-cartridge combination - most any gun-shop      owner will have a chart - to determine how far you      can expect the point of impact to change over a given      distance.)    </p>    <p>      Once carefully sighted-in, your rifle will give you the      best it's capable of. Your next step is to get in enough      shooting time with the firearm, at various distances and      from sitting, prone and offhand (standing) positions, to      make sure that you're able to contribute an equal (well,      nearly so) ability. With that done, you can take to the      field with calm confidence, which is probably the most      important hunting tool of all.    </p>
