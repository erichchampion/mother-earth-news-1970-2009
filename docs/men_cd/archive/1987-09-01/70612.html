            		<p><strong> AMERICAN COUNTRY EXCERPT</strong></p>        <p><strong>Strange but true - an uncanny tale from      Kathrynn T. Windham, storyteller.</strong>    </p>    <p>      My Aunt Bet never thought there was anything unusual about      having a tombstone in her kitchen.    </p>    <p>      Now I don't suppose Aunt Bet ever planned to have one in      her kitchen, but when she was walking home to dinner one      noon, she happened to notice a tombstone leaning against      the wall of the depot, right outside the telegrapher's      office. Before many days had passed, that tombstone was      lying on her kitchen counter.    </p>        <p>      Aunt Bet was postmaster (she scorned the word      <em>postmistress</em> , considering it insulting) in      Thomasville, Alabama, and she made two round trips daily      from her house on top of the ridge down to West Front      Street, where the post office was. She went down the hill      early in the morning to open the post office, back up the      hill after dark when the mail from the southbound train had      been distributed into the rows of lock boxes in the lobby,      and she made a trip back and forth in the middle of the day      for dinner. She always walked, said it was wasteful to      drive the five blocks between home and the post office.      Besides, she pointed out, you always saw more if you      walked.    </p>    <p>      As I said, it was on her way up the hill to dinner one      noon, just as she was crossing the railroad tracks, that      she first saw the tombstone.    </p>    <p>      Aunt Bet walked over to examine the marble slab, and she      was somewhat surprised that she did not recognize the name      engraved on it. She, being postmaster and an officer in the      Eastern Star and a member of the United Daughters of the      Confederacy, knew nearly everybody in our county and most      of the folks in the counties that touched ours. The depot      was closed for dinner, so there wasn't anybody around to      answer her questions.    </p>    <p>      She walked up the hill, wondering about the marker and      remembering its decorations: the doves, roses, acanthus      leaves, lilies, scrolls and curlicues engraved by some      unknown artisan. Aunt Bet never failed to notice and to      admire fine craftsmanship.    </p>        <p>      While we were eating dinner, Aunt Bet told about the      tombstone, and we all put our heads to thinking whose it      could be. Mother said the deceased could not have been a      Methodist, because she had never seen that name in the list      of obituaries <em>The Methodist Christian Advocate</em> ran      each week, and Daddy said he knew some folks by that name      down in the lower end of the county, but they were a kind      of sorry lot and he didn't believe any of them could afford      a fancy grave marker such as the one Aunt Bet described.      There were several comments about "some poor soul lying in      an unmarked grave" before the conversation turned to other      topics.    </p>    <p>      I kept thinking about that tombstone all the time I was      waiting for my rice pudding to get cool enough to eat.      "Heat will cool if greed will wait," Mother reminded me      when she noticed me blowing on a spoonful of the dessert.    </p>    <p>      As soon as I had finished my pudding and had been excused      from the table, I hurried down to the depot to see that      tombstone for myself. It was just like Aunt Bet had      described it, with a wreath of roses and leaves encircling      the name and dates that identified the deceased, and doves      and lilies across the top and down the sides.    </p>    <p>      I squatted down to read the inscription near the bottom.      "Not Dead But Sleeping," it said. That inscription bothered      me. It still does. I meant to ask Daddy what those words      really meant, but when I saw him at suppertime, my mind was      on other things, and I had forgotten about the tombstone.    </p>    <p>      A few days later, Aunt Bet telephoned from the post office      to say, "Alf is bringing something up there in his dray.      Please holler to Grover down in the bottom and ask him to      come help Alf put it on the kitchen counter." She hung up      before I could get around to asking her what Alf was      bringing.    </p>    <p>      So I walked out in the back yard and called Grover, and he      and I waited at the gate until Alf arrived in his      horse-drawn cart.    </p>    <p>      "Glad you're here," Alf said to Grover. "I need a strong      man to help me unload the tombstone."    </p>    <p>      "What?" Grover asked.    </p>    <p>      "Tombstone," Alf replied. "It's heavy."    </p>    <p>      Grover didn't say anything.    </p>    <p>      Alf tied his horse to the fence, and the two men hefted the      marble slab out of the dray and toted it through the yard,      across the back porch and into the kitchen. I held the      screen door open for them. They eased the stone onto the      counter, rubbed the palms of their hands up and down on      their pants legs, sort of wiping away the feel of the      thing, I suppose, and then they walked out to the street.    </p>    <p>      So that's how the tombstone came to Aunt Bet's kitchen.    </p>    <p>      Usually it was turned face down, its smooth side up, and      was used for rolling out biscuit dough, chopping fresh      vegetables, slicing meats or kneading fondant.    </p>    <p>      On those occasions when Aunt Bet was doing fancy cooking,      decorating wedding cakes or making candy mints for the      Research Club meeting and such, the tombstone was turned      face up so the soft icing or candy could be pressed into      the stone roses, leaves and doves. No telling how many      wedding cakes Aunt Bet created with garlands of roses      circling the layers and sugary doves hovering in acanthus      leaves. Her embossed mints and bonbons were envied by every      hostess in town.    </p>    <p>      "Oh, Miss Bettie, how in the world do you decorate your      cakes so beautifully? Those doves and flowers and all are      perfect! And your fancy mints! Will you, please ma'am, tell      me how to do it?" aspiring culinary decorators often asked.    </p>    <p>      "Well," Aunt Bet would reply, "first you find a tombstone."      Then, if she liked the suppliant, she'd part with a few      recipes.    </p>  <h3> Floating Cloud Biscuits</h3>    <p>      <em>2 cups flour</em> <em>4 teaspoons baking powder</em>      <em>2 teaspoons sugar</em> <em>1/4 teaspoon salt</em>      <em>1/2 cup shortening</em> <em>2/3 cup milk</em> <em>1      beaten egg</em>    </p>    <p>      Sift dry ingredients together. Cut in shortening until      mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine milk and egg and      add to mixture; stir with fork to mix. Knead gently on      floured tombstone (plain side), roll out 3/4 inch thick,      cut, and bake on ungreased baking sheet at 450°F about      12 minutes, or until lightly browned. Waste no time getting      biscuits to folks at the dining table, and have plenty of      butter and homemade preserves waiting.    </p>    <h3>Sweet Potato Biscuits</h3>    <p>      <em>1 cup flour</em> <em>3 teaspoons baking powder</em>      <em>2/3 teaspoon salt</em> <em>4 tablespoons      shortening</em> <em>1 cup cooked sweet potatoes      (mashed)</em> <em>1/2 cup milk - maybe a little      more</em>    </p>    <p>      Cut shortening into flour, salt and baking powder which      have been sifted together. Stir in sweet potatoes and add      enough milk to make a dough stiff enough to roll. Roll on      floured tombstone and cut with biscuit cutter. Bake at      400° for about 25 minutes.    </p>   <h3> Fancy Party Mints</h3>    <p>      <em>1 box powdered sugar</em> <em>5 tablespoons butter</em>      <em>2 tablespoons half-and-half</em> <em>12 drops oil of      peppermint</em> <em>Food coloring</em>    </p>    <p>      Let butter soften. Combine all ingredients and roll into      balls the size of walnuts. Press each ball gently into      dainty designs on tombstone so that imprint is left on      each.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grandma's Tea Cakes</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup sugar</em> <em>1 cup butter</em> <em>3 eggs</em>      <em>3 1/2 cups flour</em> <em>1 teaspoon vanilla</em>    </p>    <p>      Cream sugar and butter. Add eggs, beating well after each      addition. Put in flavoring and add flour to make a stiff      dough. Roll thin, cut with big biscuit cutter, and bake at      350° about 10 minutes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Old-Timey Fried Pies</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups sifted flour</em> <em>3 teaspoons baking      powder</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon salt</em> <em>1/3 cup      shortening</em> <em>2/3 cup cold milk</em> <em>Stewed dried      fruit</em>    </p>    <p>      Sift dry ingredients together and cut shortening into dry      mixture. Gradually mix in milk. Roll out on floured      tombstone (plain side) and cut into 4-inch circles (a small      saucer is helpful as a cutting guide). Spoon 1 1/2      tablespoons of stewed fruit on half of each circle and fold      other half over it. Press edges together and seal with      tines of fork. Prick tops and fry in oil in deep skillet,      turning as each side browns. Drain on paper towels.      Sprinkle with sugar. Serve hot.    </p>  <h3>  Peanut Brittle</h3>    <p>      <em>2 cups sugar</em> <em>1 cup corn syrup</em> <em>1/2 cup      water</em> <em>1 teaspoon salt</em> <em>2 tablespoons      butter</em> <em>2 cups raw peanuts</em> <em>2 teaspoons      vanilla</em> <em>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix sugar, syrup, water and salt and bring to boil. Cover      and boil 3 minutes. Remove cover and boil to hard ball      stage. Add butter and peanuts and cook until peanuts pop      and crackle. Remove from heat and quickly stir in soda and      vanilla. Pour out on greased tombstone. When set, slip      knife under edge, turn it over, and break into pieces.    </p>    <h3>Orange Cookies</h3>    <p>      <em>2/3 cup butter</em> <em>1 1/4 cups sugar</em> <em>2      eggs</em> <em>3 cups flour</em> <em>1 1/2 teaspoons      salt</em> <em>2 teaspoons baking powder</em> <em>Juice of 1      orange</em> <em>Grated rind of 2 oranges</em>    </p>    <p>      Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs one at a time, beating      after each one. Sift dry ingredients together and add to      creamed mixture. Mix in juice and rind. Chill. Roll thin      and cut with small, round cutter. Bake on greased cookie      sheet at 400° until brown.    </p>   <h3> Pulled Candy</h3>    <p>      <em>3 cups sugar</em> <em>1/4 cup vinegar</em> <em>2      tablespoons butter</em> <em>1/2 cup water</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix and cook slowly until test drops are brittle when      dropped in cold water. Do not stir while cooking. Pour out      on cold, buttered tombstone. When candy is cool enough to      handle, butter fingers and thumbs well (might as well      butter whole hands!), take up part of candy, and pull it      with long, firm strokes until it becomes porous and light      colored. Put ropes of pulled candy on buttered tombstone or      plate until it is cool and hard. Cut or break into pieces.    </p>   <h3> Ada's Pie Crust</h3>    <p>      <em>1 cup vegetable shortening</em> <em>1/2 cup boiling      water</em> <em>3 cups flour</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon baking      powder</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon salt</em>    </p>    <p>      Put shortening and boiling water in bowl over hot water      until shortening melts. Then add flour, baking powder and      salt. Mix well and beat with fork until creamy. Let cool.      Roll thin on floured tombstone.    </p>   <h3> Shortening Bread</h3>    <p>      <em>4 cups flour</em> <em>1 cup light brown sugar</em>      <em>1 pound butter</em>    </p>    <p>      Cut room-temperature butter into sugar and flour which have      been sifted together. Mix (you'll probably have to use your      hands) until firm. Roll out about 3/4 inch thick. Cut into      fancy shapes, if desired. Bake on cookie sheet at 325°      for 20 minutes.    </p>   <h3>Jefferson Davis Pie</h3>    <p>      <em>1/2 cup butter</em> <em>2 cups brown sugar</em> <em>4      egg yolks</em> <em>2 tablespoons flour</em> <em>1/2 nutmeg,      grated</em> <em>Pinch salt</em> <em>1 teaspoon      cinnamon</em> <em>1 cup cream</em> <em>1/2 cup chopped      dates</em> <em>1/2 cup raisins</em> <em>1/2 cup broken      pecan meats</em> <em>1 unbaked pie shell (Ada's      recipe)</em>    </p>    <p>      Cream butter and sugar together well. Add egg yolks one at      a time, beating after each addition. Sift flour and spices      together and blend into egg mixture, stirring until smooth.      Gradually blend in cream and stir in dates, raisins and      nuts. Pour into pie crust and bake at 300° for 40      minutes. Top with meringue (made with 4 egg whites and 1/2      cup sugar) or with whipped cream flavored with sherry.    </p>  <h3> Cherokee County Vinegar Pie</h3>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons butter</em> <em>1/2 cup sugar</em> <em>3      tablespoons flour</em> <em>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</em>      <em>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon ground      allspice</em> <em>1 egg</em> <em>2 tablespoons vinegar</em>      <em>1 cup water</em> <em>1 unbaked pie shell (Ada's      recipe)</em>    </p>    <p>      Cream butter and sugar. Sift flour and spices together and      add to mixture. Add vinegar, egg and water. Place in top of      double boiler and cook until thick, stirring often. While      filling is cooking, let pie shell bake in oven about 5      minutes at 350°. Pour filling into partially baked      shell and bake at 350° until filling is set and light      brown.    </p>    <p>      RECIPES REPRINTED FROM TREASURED ALABAMA RECIPES, ©      1967 BY KATHRYN TUCKER WINDHAM.    </p>
