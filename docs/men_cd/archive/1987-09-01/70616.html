                    <p>      <strong>A smokejumper's guide to fighting and preventing,      wildfires.</strong>    </p>		<h5 id="byline"> By Trooper Tom</h5>    <p>      "If there were dragons to slay and fair ladies to save, the      same sorts who show up to be smokejumpers would be the      knights." <em><br />      - Old-time smokejumper</em>    </p>        <p>      My old crony wasn't too far off, because wildfire      <em>is</em> a dragon! And smokejumpers are a unique bunch:      Gallant, dashing, sometimes a bit grubby (but never      tarnished), even sweat-soaked and blackened - they      are, in a strange way, noble.    </p>        <p>      Smokejumpers - some 400 of them in the U.S., 2,660 in      the Soviet Union and 50 in Canada - are our best      wildfire firefighters, and I'm proud to be one of them.      Because they parachute into remote areas, jumpers learn to      depend on their wits to make up for a lack of fire trucks,      pumpers and assorted gadgets. Common sense, experience,      physical conditioning, mental flexibility and straight      tactical knowledge make them effective.    </p>    <p>      I wish I could assure you that the smokejumpers will be      around if a wildfire threatens your country home. But the      plain truth is that - due to budget cuts, weird      government policies or just the sheer proximity of a fire      started by, say, your neighbor burning trash - we      just might not make it in time. Therefore, one day you may      have to face this beast without our help. Read on and let      the smokejumpers tell you how to be ready.    </p>    <h3>      The Dragon Is Vulnerable    </h3>    <p>      A baby dragon needs all three legs of a heat, fuel and      oxygen triangle to be born, grow, reproduce and spread.      Remove any leg of this triangle, and the dragon will slow      down and eventually die. Wildfire fighters often cool a      fire (or its fuel) by pouring water on it; we sometimes      starve a burn by clearing away fuel in its path; and at      times we'll smother a minor blaze by beating it with damp      gunnysacks.    </p>    <p>      Besides the triangle that gives the dragon life, three      environmental factors affect its speed and strength:      weather, topography and the nature of the fuel.    </p>    <p>      <em>Weather:</em> This is the most important influence on      how a fire will prosper. In fact, weather actually makes      the time ripe for a fire to start by warming, drying and      fanning the fuel.    </p>    <p>      Wind is the most obvious element. It drives the fire      forward, dries out fuel and can actually carry firebrands      beyond the immediate burn causing new fires to develop.    </p>    <p>      Humidity is also important, especially when lightweight      fuels are present. Grass, lichen, moss and small twigs      absorb moisture from the air and so may be reluctant to      carry the dragon when the air is humid. Conversely, when      the air is dry, light fuels almost immediately become      tinder. Humidity can be a dominant factor in firefighting      tactics.    </p>    <p>      Temperature is important, but it's a one-way street. That      is, the fire danger is usually greater on hot days, but      cold may not squelch a ferocious burn. I've fought fires in      Alaska in sub-zero temperatures when the humidity and winds      were the dominant factors. Likewise, summer isn't the heavy      fire season in the eastern U.S. Spring and fall, when winds      blow and the humidity is low, bring the greatest number of      wildfires.    </p>    <p>      Sunlight isn't usually mentioned as an important influence      on fires, but I've noticed that it has a lot to do with      light-fuel dryness in some situations. I've found that when      the weather is hot, sometimes only the vegetation in direct      sunlight will ignite. Also, in intense sunlight, a cloud      passing can change everything.    </p>    <p>      <em>Topography:</em> The lay of the land has much to do      with how a fire will behave. Slope, orientation and      elevation are the main influences.    </p>    <p>      The steeper the slope, the faster the dragon will run      uphill. Fuel upslope is heated by radiation and convection,      and it's more accessible to the flames than fuel on flat      terrain. There's also the chance that the beast will take      of downhill as chunks of burning material roll down.      Remember, wind isn't the only thing that determines which      way a fire will spread. Slope is a major influence on a      fire's behavior.    </p>    <p>      The direction the slope faces (its aspect) determines, in      part, how dry the vegetation will be. South- and      west-facing slopes are the driest; north-facing, the most      moist. This has become especially important as more and      more people turn their homes toward the sun for heating. A      solar home is almost automatically more vulnerable to fire      hazard and requires wise defensive preparation.    </p>    <p>      High elevation usually means lower fire danger, since it      normally offers cooler temperature, later snow melt and      more moist vegetation. However, unless you build in an      alpine zone, you probably won't be nearly high enough to      have your altitude make much difference.    </p>    <p>      <em>Fuel:</em> Each ecosystem has different vegetation      characteristics. The most important of these are moisture      content, piece size, amount per acre, proximity of clumps      and horizontal and vertical distribution. Even the chemical      make-up of the fuel is important. Some woods have pitch,      and there may be flammable oils in leaves or needles.    </p>        <p>      We smokejumpers talk about wildfires as if we were looking      down on them from above - a parachutist's-eye view.      Fig. 1 shows the dragon's basic anatomy, describing it in a      common language that a group of firefighters could use to      discuss strategy and report their positions. Let's go into      a little more detail about the parts.    </p>    <p>      <em>Head:</em> This is the main ball of heat, flames and      smoke at the front of the fire's advance. It's usually the      most difficult part of the fire to deal with. Sometimes a      wind change can blow the fire toward the tail or one of the      flanks, causing the head to relocate quickly.    </p>    <p>      <em>Tail:</em> The back of the fire is usually where it      started. On occasion, I've seen a fire burn against the      wind. This has happened on slopes with strong downhill      winds and on perfectly flat ground. We say the fire is      backing, and still call the downwind end the tail.    </p>    <p>      <em>Left and right flanks:</em> The sides of the fire may      have active flames, but they're usually less intense than      those at the head. When the head is too hot to approach,      firefighters often try to attack the flanks. One flank will      generally be less smoky than the other and will be easier      to work on.    </p>    <p>      <em>Flame length:</em> The single most important physical      aspect of a fire is the height of the flames licking out      from the head. Flame length will determine how and where      you'll do battle with the dragon. More often than not, you      don't try to kill the dragon by cutting off its oxygen      <em>or</em> cooling it. You stop it by denying it fuel. To      do so, you clear a path all the way around the fire,      encircling it with a fuel-free line two to three feet wide.      The actual width and depth of the line depend on the types      of fuels present. In the West, we dig down all the way to      mineral soil with a Pulaski. But in eastern hardwood      forest, we only rake aside the leaves with a fire rake and      remove the underbrush.    </p>    <p>      Any fallen trees that bridge the line need to be cut. Use a      chain saw to remove a piece that's as wide as the line or      twice as long as the tree's diameter, whichever is greater.    </p>    <p>      Always attack the dragon from anchor points. These are      secured zones from which you begin digging line or beating      the flames. You may start at the head or tail of the fire      and have half the team move around each flank, or you may      split the team initially and work from two anchor points      - one on each flank at a natural barrier. The      important thing here is that the anchor point is      <em>secure</em> - a place where the fire can't run      around the line and outflank you. Anchor points are vital      to success and safety. It also follows from this principle      that it takes a minimum of two people to best fight a      wildfire.    </p>    <h3>      FIREFIGHTING TOOLS    </h3>    <p>      Different regions of the country demand different      firefighting tools, but here's a summary of the necessary      pieces of equipment, what each does and about what it      costs. Since your minimum team is two people, have at least      two rakes and two Pulaskies.    </p>    <p>      <em>Fire rake:</em> This is different from a traditional      garden rake. It has triangular tines that prevent it from      plugging up with leaves. Its main purpose is to scrape off      leaves or pine needles, and it's used mainly on eastern      fires. About $25.    </p>    <p>      <em>Pulaski.</em> Half ax, half mattock, this is the      primary hand tool for digging line in western firefighting.      With it, you can chop out brush with the ax side and then      dig down to subsoil with the mattock. About $50.    </p>    <p>      <em>Drip torch:</em> An aluminum can full of a 50:50      mixture of gasoline and diesel fuel, the drip torch is the      tool for fighting fire with fire. It lays down a stream of      flame and is the best device for burning out large areas. A      Fuzee, a standard highway flare, will suffice for small      areas.    </p>    <p>      <em>Backpack water pump:</em> This common five-gallon      device - often used for distributing agricultural      chemicals - is great for wetting down fuels and for      mopping up small hot spots after fighting a fire. About      $100.    </p>    <p>      <em>Chain saw:</em> For woodland fires, you'll need      something to section downed trees. I've been fond of my      Husqvarna 44 and my Homelite 925, but lately I've really      taken to Shindaiwa's 695 - a 4.2-cubic-inch saw with      a 28-inch bar. Between $350 and $550.    </p>    <p>      <em>Motorized pump:</em> If you have any sort of body of      water - pool or pond - it's worthwhile to have      a pump. You can use it to deliver water directly through      hose, or you can fill up a fiberglass holding tank in a      pickup and have your own miniature pumper. About $300.    </p>    <p>      <em>Silv-ex:</em> This foaming chemical increases water's      ability to cool and penetrate. Used at the rate of a couple      of teaspoons per five gallons, it really boosts the      efficiency of a backpack water pump. You can also use it      with a motorized pump to do larger areas or even to foam      your house. About $100 per five gallons from Wajax-Pacific      Fire Equipment, P.O. Box 88540, Seattle, WA 98188, or you      can order smaller quantities from me.    </p>    <p>      You can probably find most of this equipment at a local      dealer. If you run into trouble, though, I'm a dealer for      most of these items. Write me at Trooper Tom's Fire      Protection Company, P.O. Box 44, Manzanita, OR 97130.    </p>    <p>      If the flame length is short - less than two feet      - you can make a <em>direct attack</em> on the      dragon's head. When the fire is smoldering, creeping or      running along close to the ground, you can usually get up      close enough to clear a fuel-free path or actually beat out      the flames directly.    </p>    <p>      When the flames or smoke are a little too intense for you      to get close to the head, you can start at the tail and      work forward along the flanks. If at all possible, though,      go for the dragon's head while it's still vulnerable. Winds      could pick up while you're working your way around the      flanks, and the head could gain intensity and speed.    </p>    <p>      If you're unable to go straight for the dragon's head or      tail, move out in front of the fire's advance and set up an      ambush. In an <em>indirect attack,</em> you dig a line and      burn the fuel before the fire arrives. There's no      substitute for experience in determining just how far ahead      to set the ambush. Lacking that, be sure to err on the side      of safety. Move out far enough to give yourself plenty of      time to burn out the line and still keep your people out of      the dragon's reach.    </p>    <p>      Dig a line one to three feet wide, depending on the      flammability of the fuel and the size of the crew, moving      from the head around the flanks. As you go, have the last      person in the team burn out on the inside of the line,      <em>closest</em> to the fire. The intentional burn will      consume the fuel between the fire and the line, halting the      dragon's advance.    </p>    <p>      Know your land and use natural barriers to help you make a      stand. Roads, streams, ponds, trails and other natural      features are great places to stop the dragon in its tracks.      Even a meadow is preferable to a heavily wooded area,      because it will be easier for the crew to clear the lighter      fuels from the fire's path. In this area, at least, a      homeowner can have an advantage over a professional      smokejumper. The jumper may have the ability to compute      flame length, travel time, manpower and fuel types to      estimate what the fire <em>might</em> do. But the homeowner      knows where the natural barriers are without having to      reconnoiter.    </p>    <h3>      Knowing When to Back Off    </h3>    <p>      Flame lengths greater than about eight feet are considered      uncontrollable. Also, if there are ladder fuels lifting low      flames up into trees or if there are firebrands being      carried past you by the wind and starting spot fires,      you're in over your head and are in danger. Back off! There      are few jobs more dangerous than fighting out-of-control      wildfires. Respect the dragon; it's better to retreat and      have a chance to fight again another day.    </p>    <h3>      TROOP TELLS YOU HOW TO FORM A FIRE-MANAGEMENT PLAN    </h3>    <p>      According to the National Fire Protection Association,      there were 83,000 wildfires in 1985, and they burned      roughly 3 million acres. Those fires destroyed 1,400      structures and killed 44 people. Sadly, proper planning      could have prevented most of the devastation. The following      plan will help you stop a dragon before it ever gets      started.    </p>    <h3>      First Your Home    </h3>    <p>      Start your dragon-proofing by securing your home against      fires that start in it or nearby. The prime breeding ground      for large reptiles in your home is the woodstove.      Installation standards are readily available, and you      should observe them. There do seem to be a few areas where      people often foul up, though. Heat shields for walls should      have a one-inch air space behind them. Without air space,      they don't shield much.    </p>    <p>      Stovepipe can also be confusing. Once you make a wall or      ceiling pass with insulated pipe, stick with it. If you      revert to the singlewall material, you'll have creosote      condensation problems. A lot of people are using stainless      steel stovepipe now, rather than the cheaper black steel or      galvanized stuff. It lasts much longer and won't surprise      you by burning through.    </p>    <p>      Be sure you have working smoke detectors installed at the      locations recommended on the packages. A combination      ionization-photoelectric detector gives the best all-around      protection from all sorts of fires.    </p>    <p>      Check your electrical panel boxes twice a year. Be sure      that all the wires are tight and that the connections to      breakers and the ground and neutral bars are coated with a      light layer of grease. Looseness and corrosion will cause      arcing, sparks and perhaps a fire. If you have an appliance      that keeps throwing a breaker or lights that dim at times,      make sure that the circuits are correctly designed and that      everything's right in the panel.    </p>    <p>      Locate an ABC fire extinguisher in a prominent place, and      make sure that all your family members know how to use it.      (Proper use of a fire extinguisher is <em>not</em>      obvious.) In the winter, keep any firefighting water pumps      filled and in heated spaces, so they won't be frozen up      when you need them. This may be vital when outside faucets      are inoperable. And remember, wildfires do occur in winter.    </p>    <p>      Keep fire department and forest service phone numbers      posted near (or on) your telephones.    </p>    <p>      The roof is the most vulnerable part of a rural home. And      pretty as they are, shake roofs are the worst. In fact, I      don't see why any insurance company would underwrite a      shake-roofed house in a fire zone.    </p>    <p>      Make sure that all electric service lines are clear of      vegetation. Tree limbs rubbing on wires in the wind      continue to cause an amazing number of fires every year.    </p>    <p>      Display your house number clearly at your driveway      entrance, especially if your house is out of sight from the      road. This will help firefighters find you quickly in an      emergency. Then make sure that your driveway and roads are      wide enough for large firefighting vehicles to reach your      home and outbuildings. Vehicles should be able to pass, and      there should be places to turn around.    </p>    <h3>      Then Your Land    </h3>    <p>      To be ready for the dragon in the woods, you need to      carefully map your property and plan a firefighting      strategy. This will settle your thoughts, and it will help      professional firefighters in the area do their jobs.    </p>        <p>      Topographical maps probably won't provide enough detail, so      you'll need to work from either a surveyor's plat or an      aerial photo. Your county courthouse may have one or both.      Another source for aerial photos is W.A.C. Corporation, 520      Conger St., Eugene, OR 97402; 800/845-8088 or 503/      342-5169. When you call them, have a legal description of      your land ready (again, from the courthouse) and ask for a      1 "- to - 200' scale photo. (A 1" - to - 400' photo will      do, if that's all they have.)    </p>    <p>      From the photo or plat, make an overlay map using tracing      paper, and ink in compass directions and magnetic      declination. Use the map and photo to explore your property      in your imagination, and then take off on foot with map,      compass and engineer's tape to look closely. Match the      features on the facsimiles to what you see. Become very      familiar with both the real and depicted worlds.    </p>    <p>      When you understand the lay of your land, it's time to      think like a dragon-slaying warrior. Your last line of      defense should come first. Vegetation within 100 feet of      your house should be sparse and well spread out. If not,      clear it. Be particularly concerned about the 100 feet      that's between your home and the prevailing wind direction.    </p>    <p>      If your home is on a slope, the ground below should be      cleared even farther - on steep slopes at least 200      feet, and preferably 300 feet, out. Ornamental trees that      are well separated and clear of low branches are OK.    </p>    <p>      Now circle your house just beyond the 100 foot (or greater)      perimeter with a cleared line that ties into roads and      natural barriers. The line can be a quaint trail so it      won't disturb the landscaping. This will be your last      defense should the dragon appear unstoppable. You burn out      from it before the wildfire arrives, to create a black area      the flames can't cross. Flag the line with pieces of      engineer's tape so it will be obvious to anyone in an      emergency, and pencil in the line on your map.    </p>    <p>      Next, exploit existing barriers farther out on your      property. Maintain roads both for firebreaks and also for      access to remote areas. Cut back the canopy over streams so      fire can't bridge them.    </p>    <p>      If existing fire control lines don't provide an adequate      distant perimeter to defend, plan to make your own. Follow      your property lines, marking a pleasantly meandering trail      that averages about 10 feet from the boundaries. Pencil      this in on your map as you go.    </p>    <p>      Then approach your neighbors, explain what you're doing and      see if you can convince them to do the same. With      cooperation, you can each take on a portion of the work of      creating and maintaining a sort of <em>no-man's land.</em>      You'll each dig a line along your boundary trail and clear      the forest floor of underbrush to the boundary.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WILDFIRE<br /></strong> Your last defense will be a      burned-back line that the fire can't cross.    </p>    <p>      Trees in the no-man's land should be pruned to leave open      space between crowns and to remove branches for 15 feet up      the trunks. Leave nothing that might serve as a fire ladder      to the crowns. Clear away shrubs and brush, and let grass      grow. This isn't a bulldozed, barren strip; it's more like      a park that can be burned off to create a 20-foot-wide      black line to stop the dragon. If you're unable to get      cooperation from neighbors, you'll have to dig two lines on      your own side of the boundary and maintain the whole      noman's land.    </p>    <p>      Include on your map a plan for thinning all the woodlands      on your property. You don't have to do the work all at      once; you can set dates to do different sections. Then      carry the map to the state forestry people, and explain      what you're doing. Tell them you want your first five or      six acres of thinning to act as a planned fire control line      as well as a tree crop area.    </p>    <p>      Once you've got forester's approval, submit your entire      management plan to the local fire chief and ask for      suggestions and some sort of endorsement. When you send      copies of all this to your homeowner's insurance company,      you should get a substantial reduction in rate. If not,      maybe it's time to look for a new insurance company.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Trooper Tom's complete</em> <em>wildfire      fighting manual,</em> From Dragon Slayers, is <em>now      available.
