                    <h5 id="byline">      by A. MICHAEL WASSIL    </h5>        <p>      With all the discussion that's going on about natural power      for home use, no one yet seems to have expounded at length      on one source of energy that's readily available to      homesteaders: namely, the heat that goes up the old      stovepipe. Seems a shame to let those calories get away ...      especially when you think of them in terms of firewood and      all the energy you've expended cutting it.</p><p> Although I've      never actually measured the B.t.u.'s roaring out the top      end of a stovepipe, I have toasted bread (in about one      second) and boiled pots of water in the hot blast from a      small stove. Perhaps some thermal buff out there in      MOTHERland would like to do the measurements on the      quantity of heat that escapes up the flue . . . given      various-sized stoves, different lengths and diameters of      stovepipe and varying intensities of flame in the firebox.At any rate, while the rest of us are waiting for such a      report, here are a few suggestions for utilizing some of      that energy.    </p>    <p>      [1] Use the stovepipe itself as a radiant      heater, the way many pioneer builders did in New England,      here in Ontario and elsewhere. In a single-storied      structure, put the stove at one end of the building and      carry the pipe horizontally to the other end and then out      as shown in Fig. 1.</p><p> When there's more than one story, just      run the vent straight up through the rooms above (see Fig.      2). Whatever you do, though, don't put your stovepipe up in      the manner depicted on the cover of MOTHER NO. 18!</p><p> [2] The      Palace Grand in Dawson City, Yukon Territory has a unique      (the owners claim) variation on Suggestion Number 1. This      device-which they call a double stove-is simply      a large hot air chamber part way up the stovepipe that      traps some of the escaping heat and radiates it into the      room.</p><p> The model in Dawson is a bit complicated, and      consists of a modified 45-gallon steel drum (see Fig. 3). 1      imagine that an unmodified steel drum (Fig. 4) would also      work. Either version would be more efficient filled with      pebbles or stones, which would absorb      heat-sauna-style-and radiate it back even after      the stove itself had burned low. Don't pack in the rocks      very snugly, though, or you'll kill the draft.</p><p> [3] Instead      of an air chamber, put a water tank (Fig. 5) on the      stovepipe. This involves a little plumbing since you have      to run the pipe through the middle of the water container.      You'll need a tap at the bottom of the tank and some sort      of inlet at the top (this could be as elaborate as a float      valve hooked up to your main water source to keep the      reservoir full automatically, or as simple as a movable lid      that allows you to dump in replacement water by hand).      There you are ... a convenient hot water supply.</p><p> Although      insulation will keep the water in the tank hot longer, I'd      advise against it.  In the winter, when the stove is going all the time, the      water will never get cool anyhow ... and the bare metal of      the reservoir will act as a radiator.    </p>    <p>      [4] Put an oven (Fig.      6) in the stovepipe. Units that fit into a standard smoke      vent used to be available commercially (and as far as /      know they still are ... from the Louisville Tin and Stove      Company, 737 South 13th Street, Louisville, Kentucky      402l0-MOTHER). Or you can make your own.</p><p> [5] In      MOTHER NO. 18 (pg. 112), Bill Lange suggested a concentric      double stovepipe in which one of the conduits draws outside      air into the heater and warms it in the process.    </p>        <p>      I suggest using the center pipe as the intake and extending      it a couple of feet higher at the upper end than the      surrounding output duct (see Fig. 7). At the lower-or      stove-end, the intake pipe should be taken right through      the bottom of the firebox into the ash box chamber (Fig.      8).</p><p> This arrangement, of course, would necessitate some      modification of the damper so, instead, you could run the      intake pipe around the damper ... or eliminate the damper      itself and regulate the firebox by a smaller valve in the      intake pipe only.</p><p> [6] Finally, and most elaborately of all,      you could use that stovepipe heat to boil water to run a      small steam engine, either a conventional piston type or a      more efficient turbine. The steam engine in turn could      power a small generator to supply a modest amount of      electricity ... sufficient, maybe, to operate a few light      bulbs.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, I'm planning a stovepipe-powered      turbine myself and would like to enlist the help of      MOTHER's readers. Can anyone out there tell me how much      current is needed to operate two or three small fluorescent      bulbs, how small a generator would suffice to provide that      current and how much power a steam engine would have to      develop to run such a generator? If you have technical data      that might help me out, I'd like to hear from you. Here's      my address: </p><p>A.
