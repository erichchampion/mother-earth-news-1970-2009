                    		<hr />    <p>      <em>Nothing says "holiday" like mince pies...especially if      you make the filling yourself. Here, Ruth Hampton tells you      how to stage one of those satisfying annual cooking orgies      for which a good, old-fashioned country kitchen was just      naturally designed</em>.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Do you like to serve your family winter desserts packed      with protein, iron and vitamins? Did your good organic      gardening result in gleaming glasses of wholesome jellies,      mounds of firm, crisp apples and gallons of cider? Does      your cellar hold home-dried raisins and jars of watermelon      preserves, dried or preserved peaches, pears, cherries or      orange peel? Well, today's the day...a mincemeat day!    </p>        <p>      No, I <em>don't</em> mean that stale, medicinal-tasting      mixture from the supermarket...I'm talking about luscious,      juicy, home-grown mincemeat that will make moist cakes,      rich cookies and delectable pies all through the cold,      stay-in-and-bake days of winter.    </p>    <p>      One requirement for a mincemeat day is a nip in the air and      lots of dry leaves in varying shades of red, gold and      brown. With them should be wind-not a      Christmas-loaded-with-snow wind but a frisky, cold,      leaf-dancing wind-and overhead, gray skies. A little      rain won't hurt, though it isn't absolutely necessary...but      gray, definitely: dull gray and windy, with apples.</p><p> That's      the second "must": The apples have to be in-in from      the orchard, in from the garage, in from the      cellar-fragrant, tart and firm. A health-packed      harvest.</p><p> At our house there also has to be at least one fat      venison neck. Other cuts may be used in order to have      enough meat to mince, but the neck is the favored part. I      understand people in other areas of the country make      mincemeat out of good homegrown lamb or beef,      but-having always lived in the south-eastern Oregon      mountains-I haven't tried this. You can probably      adapt a windy, leafy, gray day to any kind of makings you      have, but if your family hunts...fresh venison.    </p>    <p>      Then there must be jars, lots of them, hot and gleaming.      The book says that half an hour in a dishwasher easily      equals half an hour in Grandma's copper boiler when it      comes to sterilizing glasses, so if you have buttons, push      them. If not-and if you've misplaced that caldron of      Grandma's-try boiling the containers in a large      roasting pan and storing them in a warm oven until the      mincemeat is done.    </p>    <p>		  Jars, meat, apples and the right day:      these are the basics. Start early and, while the salted      meat is boiling in a big kettle, peel all those firm ruddy      apples.The clamp-on peeler I ordered from a catalog last year      works and looks very much like the old-timer I used to      borrow from my pioneer-family neighbors. With this gadget I      can easily do all my fruit while the venison is cooking to      just tender.    </p>    <p>      As the apples are pared and cut, put them in ice-cold      salted water and hold them until the meat is chopped (or      ground, but not too fine...you should have about five      quarts). Then chop the apples, or grind them      coarsely-you'll need about ten quarts of minced      fruit-and combine the two ingredients in the kettle      along with the deer-or-whatever broth. (Don't forget: Into      the compost heap with all those peelings!)</p><p> The rest is      fancy work, and highly individual. My mother's letter, sent      to me years ago in lieu of a formal recipe, says, "Add two      or three pounds of brown sugar, one full cup of wine      vinegar (or something...my mom is a good teetotaler) and      maybe two pounds of seedless raisins, dried currants, dried      mixed fruits. (One pound of each is fine, and omit anything      you don't like.)    </p>    <p>      "Also add a glass of watermelon preserves (if you've never      heard of 'em, inquire of someone over forty, or use more      mixed fruit), a glass of dark jelly, half a pound of ground      suet (you know, the beef fat that people put in bird      feeders), about half a gallon of apple cider and some      cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla. (Start with one      teaspoon each, and don't get carried away until you've      cooked and tasted the stuff.) Simmer everything over low      heat for several hours, stirring and tasting until the      mixture is dark and syrupy. Ladle it into hot jars and seal      them."    </p>    <p>      That's all there is to it...except for those long happy      hours in a warm, fragrant kitchen...stirring, reading a      little, tasting and admiring the gray, blustery day      outside. You know, a mincemeat day.    </p>
