        [i] Dr. Farber designed this portable solar cooker more than 10 years ago. It's merely an umbrella which has been coated with a reflective cloth, and which has a cooking rack mounted at the end of its handle. During unexpected downpours, you can use the ""cooker"" to keep you dry until the sun comes out again!
