        <p>Now the only trouble with this digester was the fact that the fellow who spent so much time telling everyone what a great welder he was . . . really wasn't at all. The digestion unit-and its water jacket-leaked like the proverbial sieve, in other words, the instant we tried to put the waste disposal plant into operation . . . and we were forced to shelve the whole project until the spring of 1973.</p><p>Dick Shuttleworth has now completely redesigned and rebuilt the bio-gas unit, however, and it works like a charm. After only a single loading of cow manure in midJuly, the digester is still producing an average of 41 cubic feet of exceptionally high-quality methane at this writing (mid-November). Which is to say that MOTHER's bio-gas plant is working better in nearly all respects than everyone predicted. <strong>MORE Â»</strong></p>
