         [1] One of the good source of natural cordage is the bark from dead trees. Just strip off long sections of the fibrous cambium layer between the wood and the outer bark, and wrap them together. [2] In order to break down this material a little more, damper your skin and roll the fibers between your palms or against your leg. [3] You can make a simple wrap by twisting the fibers into a strand. Then — to secure the twist — take the middle in your teeth and bring the two end together. When you let go, the strand will twist around itself naturally.
