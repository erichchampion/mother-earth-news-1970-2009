                <p>      <em>Here's a new way to get more heat, and less creosote      and pollution, from your woodstove . . .</em>    </p>            <p>      Wood heating, for all the satisfaction it brings, involves      a lot of hard work . . . and anything that could trim the      burden of cutting, splitting, and hauling fuel - or      reduce the frequency of chimney cleanings - would be      more than welcome to just about any stove owner. Of course,      most veteran woodburners take pains to see that the wood      they cut gets well used . . . and as a consequence many      such folks have toyed with devices that claim to either      increase heat transfer efficiency or reduce creosote      formation. Unfortunately, as many of those experimenters      have found out, heat exchangers generally speed up the      accumulation of creosote deposits . . . and most      add-to-the-fire chemicals don't seem to help much in      removing this messy (and dangerous) substance. (See      "Testing Chemical Chimney Cleaners", on page 118 of MOTHER      NO. 71, for more information on that subject.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, over the past few years woodstove manufacturers      have devoted a great deal of research effort to improving      the performance of their products . . . in the hope of      increasing overall heating efficiency, reducing creosote      deposits, <em>and</em> limiting the load of pollutants that      woodburners release into the atmosphere. We've chronicled      that research (in MOTHER NOS. 67, 72, and 77) and have      waited anxiously for breakthroughs.    </p>    <p>      Well, we're glad to say that the latest      secondary-combustion stoves do seem to fill the bill, and      many of us have eyed them longingly . . . wishing that we      could justify replacing our old metal boxes with      state-ofthe-art (perhaps catalytic-converter-equipped)      heaters. Unfortunately, as attractive as those alternatives      are, their price tags are usually pretty danged formidable.    </p>    <p>      Consequently - after suffering through a heating      season of wishful frustration - MOTHER's staff      members began conducting some experiments of their own in      April of 1982. The goal was to develop a catalytic      converter package that could be <em>added</em> to any of      the majority of existing woodstove types . . . so that      efficient, clean burning could be made available to the      wood-heating public at an affordable price.    </p>    <p>      And if you read about the stack temperature thermostat      (which was featured on page 41 of issue 77), you already      know that members of our staff had been - for some      time - working on woodburning-related projects with      independent researcher B.V. Alvarez. The catalyst project      was once again headed by B.V. and was, in fact, in progress      when we reported on the thermostat. Since that issue went      to press, B.V. has accepted a position directing      engineering at Buck Stove Corporation, and the final      prototype was developed and tested in cooperation with that      company. By the time you read this, Buck will be well on      its way to introducing a retrofit package (patent pending),      similar to the one shown here, for its line of products.    </p>    <p>      Collectively, Alvarez and MOM's staffers spent thousands of      hours - many of them during the hot, humid days of      summer - cuddled up with the stove that Buck provided      for testing . . . in a <em>non-air-conditioned</em> room at      MOTHER'S research center. We won't be labor the amount of      effort that has gone into this article (much of which, of      course, also went into the development of Buck Stove's new      product) or take the space to try to thank everyone on the      outside who's helped out. Perhaps it's enough to say that      all of the parties involved had - and have - a      commitment to see that this technology gets to the public .      . . that is, to <em>you</em> .    </p>        <p>      <strong>A HOT SUBJECT</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you may know, the goal of most woodheat development is      to achieve more complete combustion, which can lead to      increased heat output and less creosote buildup. And one of      the major obstacles to accomplishing that goal is the very      nature of wood itself. A pile of logs in a stove will      always burn unevenly . . . thus, there are almost always      areas in the firebox that are left to smolder. (A heavily      draft-restricted fire, of course, is almost entirely in      that dirty, smoldering state.)    </p>    <p>      Now some of the recently released state-of-the-art heaters      can achieve excellent combustion efficiency without      resorting to catalytic converters, but without exception      these units are carefully designed from the legs up. So for      those of us who already <em>have</em> woodburning heaters,      a retrofit catalyst is - for now - the only way      to significantly improve combustion efficiency.    </p>    <p>      Chemically, a catalyst is a substance that will facilitate      a chemical reaction without being changed by it. Ceramic      honeycombs coated with platinum and/or palladium and/or      rhodium have filled this role in cleaning up automobile      exhaust emissions since the early 1970's. The devices allow      carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and carbon particles that      have slipped past an engine's combustion chambers to be      afterburned at a temperature lower than their usual      ignition point.    </p>    <p>      And in the late 1970's, engineers at Corning Glass Works      (then a major producer of ceramic monoliths - a trade      term used to describe the honeycomb structure - for      cars) recognized that the emissions from woodstoves were      similar, in many ways, to those from autos. By building a      honeycomb with more open space (to avoid draft restriction      and allow easy passage of heavy particles), they were able      to develop a "tailpipe scrubber" for woodburners.    </p>    <p>      A catalytic converter can reduce the ignition temperature      of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from upward of      1300°F to the 500-700°F range. So, once the smoke      passing through the catalyst reaches that threshold, it      will oxidize . . . as long as the combustibles in it are      well mixed with a sufficient supply of air. After it's      "lit", the converter will produce enough heat to maintain      ignition, even though the temperature of the incoming "wood      gas" may drop slightly <em>below</em> 500°F.    </p>    <p>      As a result, a properly functioning catalytic converter can      boost woodstove combustion efficiency to over the 90% mark,      since most of the burnables that slip past the fire zone      will be ignited in the converter. Thus, the amount of      material available to stick to stovepipe walls will be less      (and pollution will be reduced). Furthermore, if the energy      that's converted as the smoke is burned in the ceramic      monolith can be <em>extracted</em> , there will be more      heat released into the room.    </p>    <p>      That bit of background should make the advantages offered      by a catalytic converter pretty obvious. A package similar      to the one we're detailing in this article has proved      itself able to increase a stove's heat output (which is a      result of both combustion <em>and</em> heat-transfer      efficiency) by better than 15%, and has reduced creosote      accumulation in a stovepipe connector by more than 80%.      Plus, while we haven't the equipment to actually quantify      any reduction in emissions, it's a reasonable assumption      (based on research already done by experts in the field)      that the device cuts pollution significantly.    </p>    <p>      The package that you see in the accompanying photos and      illustrations can be adapted to fit a wide variety of      stoves, but the actual modifications will be up to you to      design . . . since every brand of heater will require its      own, often minor, changes in the plan. The research team      has installed converters on three different stoves, and has      had to adapt them in each case. The crew's experience      indicates, however, that the basic concept can be applied      to just about any roughly cubic metal (steel or iron)      woodburner. Therefore, the most important information we      can provide you will be the fundamentals of good design . .      . rather than a single, rigidly limited set of      instructions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BASICS OF SOUND DESIGN</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>[l] Get the catalyst close to the heat      source.</strong> Since the converter must reach a      temperature of at least 500°F before it "lights off", a      location close to the fire will insure that the unit starts      working as soon as possible and continues to do so      throughout the burn. In fact, we developed several early      versions that attached to the stovepipe <em>outside</em>      the firebox, and at that location our attempts to keep the      catalyst active at low burn rates weren't very successful.      In the test stove, for instance, a burn rate of two pounds      of wood per hour produced a stack temperature of 250°F      at the exit to the stovepipe. At that temperature, the      catalyst died after a few minutes of activity. Furthermore,      the chance of relighting the catalyst after fuel reloading      was an iffy matter, at best.    </p>    <p>      For that reason, the decision was made to move the package      <em>inside</em> the stove and as close to the fire zone as      possible. To avoid using up any more firebox capacity than      would be absolutely necessary, the conventional round      catalyst was abandoned, and two smaller rectangular units      were used instead. The monoliths mount side by side. . .      low on the stove's back wall. As you can see in the      accompanying illustration, the ceramic blocks are encased      in a steel box that pins them against the metal of the      heater's firebox (a layer of Interam gasketing insulates      the catalysts, seals any small gaps, and protects them from      possible damage caused by contact with the steel).    </p>    <p>      The combination of the two rectangles and the steel box      takes up 2 inches of firebox space to a point 6 inches      above the stove floor. From there, the container tapers      down to a 3/4" passage, which takes up only an inch of      firebox depth up to the top of the back wall. Even with the      unit installed in a <em>small</em> cast-iron heater (one      which holds only 20 pounds of wood per load), this loss of      firebox space hasn't been a problem. In fact, the reduction      in capacity is more than made up for in increased output,      and removal of any smoke shelf or baffle (which is no      longer functional) may actually increase useful volume in      some cases.    </p>    <p>      With the converters set close to the fire, the heater will      maintain a catalyst intake temperature of at least      550°F . . . even at a burn rate of two pounds of      air-dried oak per hour. What's more, the heat released as      the catalysts work seems to be efficiently exchanged      through the walls of the stove before it's lost out the      chimney (loss of heat up the flue from      <em>stovepipe-mounted</em> units is a potential problem).    </p>    <p>      <strong>[2] Avoid flame impingement on the      catalyst.</strong> If flames from the fire are allowed to      lick directly onto the monolith, the ceramic may crack as a      result of thermal shock. The baffled opening which is      detailed in the accompanying diagram prevented any flame      front from reaching the catalysts during our extended      testing. We positioned an array of thermocouples along the      back side of the baffle to sense extreme temperatures, and      found that the readings consistently stayed below      1000°F. We strongly suggest that you incorporate such a      baffle arrangement, since eliminating it could result in      drastically shortened catalyst life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>[3] There must be adequate oxygen at the      catalyst.</strong> In order for the smoke to burn in the      catalyst, it must be well mixed with a sufficient supply of      air. The early prototypes had provisions for admitting      preheated secondary air directly to the catalyst(s). But      with the help of sound advice from a Corning Glass Works      engineer and his oxygen analyzer, it was determined that      specific provisions for secondary air weren't needed. Under      all burn conditions, there was <em>always</em> an adequate      air supply remaining at the converters.    </p>    <p>      Of course, one of the limitations inherent in retrofitting      an existing stove with a catalyst is that the heater's      firebox has not been specifically designed to optimize the      muting of air and smoke. The arrangement you see here pulls      the air across the zone where the smoke is being produced,      and there's every indication that mixing <em>is</em>      effective. Still, one obvious limitation involved in using      rectangular catalysts is that the outer corners are often      not as active as are the more central areas of the      monoliths . . . because the flow patterns and/or mixing are      not perfect. In this regard, it's likely that a      <em>well-designed</em> "from scratch" catalyst stove may      perform slightly better, but everyone who's been involved      in this project feels that such tradeoffs are easily      compensated for by the cash saved when you retrofit instead      of buying new.    </p>    <p>      <strong>[4] Hotter air (both primary and secondary) means      better performance.</strong> Well-warmed primary air      encourages efficient primary combustion, and hot secondary      air is vital to maintaining ignition temperature at the      catalyst(s). On the stove we tested, air was admitted      through an automatic thermostat set about midway up the      heater's door. A baffle attached to the inside of the door      then directed the air down to the stove floor . . . both to      preheat it and to direct the blast right at the burn zone.      Secondary-air preheating is accomplished by pulling the air      through the fire zone to the catalyst and, by all      indications, has been quite effective.    </p>    <p>      It's very important, however, to be certain that the sides      of the metal casing around the catalyst are well sealed . .      . to avoid any unintended bypassing by either smoke or air.      In addition, testing has shown that the ends of the box at      the base should be closed and sealed, to prevent an air-      and/or smoke-flow pattern that would run against the walls      of the heater, where the gases would be cooled. (For that      reason, the package should be kept in the middle of the      stove's back wall . . . well away from the firebox sides.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>[5] A well-sealed, strong bypass valve is      mandatory.</strong> Even though the cell structure of the      catalyst is relatively open (in comparison with that of the      automotive variety), the unit does restrict natural draft      to some extent . . . particularly when the catalyst isn't      lit. For that reason, there <em>must</em> be a valve that      allows you to shunt smoke around the catalyst while a new      fire gets going and <em>whenever</em> the stove's doors are      opened. Failure to engage the bypass when the doors are      opened will almost certainly result in smoke spillage into      the room, which could lead to a flaming backflash. This can      be dangerous!    </p>    <p>      We strongly recommend that you interlock the bypass valve      with the door latch (as the Buck Stove people have done),      so that no one can inadvertently open the doors without      bypassing the catalyst. For similar reasons, we also think      that it's a good idea to arrange the valve so that it falls      open under the influence of gravity. That way, any      mechanical or operator problem will err on the side of      safety.    </p>    <p>      The bypass valve should also be built to seal tightly. Any      smoke that leaks around it will miss the catalyst and      reduce efficiency. You should use metal that's at least      1/4" thick, too - since the temperatures in the valve      area are likely to be high enough to cause warping in      thinner material - and the hinges should be of      substantial thickness for the same reason.    </p>    <p>      If all stoves were the same, we could tell you exactly how      to build a bypass valve for yours. As it is, though, there      are a lot of differences among existing designs . . . and      that fact demands some ingenuity on the part of      retrofit-minded stove owners.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT</strong>    </p>        <p>      Once the research crew was satisfied that the prototype was      achieving performance in keeping with what they'd hoped      for, the unit was subjected to a period of extended      testing. First, the stove was run for approximately 150      hours with the package in place. During that time, about      375 pounds of air-dried oak was consumed . . . at a variety      of burn rates. Subsequently, the catalysts were removed      from their steel jacket, and the heater was operated under      the same conditions (equal burn rates, time, and wood      poundage) with the bypass valve closed to move smoke      through the empty converter chamber. (By leaving that      casing in place, we hoped to find out how much heat the      catalyst <em>itself</em> contributed . . . rather than the      sum of the catalyst input <em>and</em> the heat exchange      effect produced by its metal jacket.)    </p>    <p>      The stove was set in a small, well-insulated room that was      equipped with blowers to extract air and a generous inlet      to admit air at the ambient temperature in the building.      The temperatures at intake and exhaust were monitored      continuously, and the rise was taken to be representative      of the stove's heat output.    </p>    <p>      Our testing methods were quite basic and somewhat limited      in scope and accuracy when compared with the sophisticated      calorimeter rooms used by some laboratories. We did,      however, obtain results that repeated to within 4% when the      measured burn rates were equal. We have no way of knowing      whether this variation is due to experimental error or an      actual change in the stove's operating efficiency . . . but      it could easily be either or a combination of the two. (In      any event, the results reported here shouldn't be viewed as      being any more accurate than that 4% figure.)    </p>    <p>      Averaging the figures recorded during ten burn cycles      (which included from one to four fuel loadings each)      <em>with</em> the catalyst and ten without, we witnessed an      efficiency increase of 15.6% when the unit was in place. If      we took the best run without the catalyst and compared it      to the worst with it, the improvement would still be about      11%. On the other hand, the <em>worst</em> run without the      catalyst compared to the <em>best</em> run with it shows an      improvement of better than 20%. (It's important for you to      understand what these statistics do - and don't      - mean. The improvement is not an incremental gain in      the stove's total efficiency . . . rather, it's the      percentage increase of one output compared with the other.      For example, a 15.6% gain for a heater operating at 55%      efficiency would raise its total output efficiency to 63.6%      . . . an actual increase of 8.6 points.)    </p>    <p>      Because we knew that there would be experimental      inaccuracies, we made every effort to err on the      conservative side. For example, the stove we used was      equipped with an automatic blower, but we chose to run the      fan on "high" constantly. This kept the amount of waste      heat from the blower roughly equal at all times, but also      made it more difficult to get the catalysts lit off . . .      since so much heat was being extracted from the stove's      back wall. If the fan had been operated on automatic, it's      very possible that the efficiency would have been higher      still with the catalysts in place.    </p>        <p>      While we were recording the efficiency measurements, we      also ran a creosote accumulation test. At the beginning of      each phase of the study, we installed a new, lower      stovepipe connector that had been weighed. After the phase      was completed, we removed the connector and reweighed it .      . . to judge the amount of creosote that had built up.      During the entire test, we prevented stack temperature from      ever exceeding 600°F at the bottom of the connector, so      that deposits wouldn't be burned away by the heat.    </p>    <p>      The single runs in each mode didn't provide a great      quantity of data to work with, but they did show a      reduction of creosote of a little more than 80%. This      figure is higher than those developed by some stack-mounted      catalysts (see "Testing Creosote-Removing/Reducing Devices"      in issues 73 and 74), but is a little lower than those      achieved by some well-designed catalyst stoves.      Consequently, we think that our figures are probably in the      ballpark, and that you can expect creosote to deposit in      your chimney <em>much</em> more slowly once you've      installed this catalytic converter. (Of course, a converter      is still no substitute for regular chimney inspection and      maintenance.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOT TIPS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you get the hang of it, operating a stove equipped      with catalytic converters is only a <em>little</em> more      difficult than managing a heater without them. (And in the      long run, you won't have to be putting in wood as often.)      As we've already mentioned, the single most important      precaution is to always bypass the converters when the      doors are opened. Furthermore, that same valve will have to      be open while you're getting a fire going.    </p>    <p>      As soon as the burn is established - to the point      where you would normally shut down the draft control to get      the output you desire - the bypass can be closed      slowly. (Don't <em>slam</em> it shut . . . or you'll be      likely to get a backpuff. ) Approximately five minutes      after the bypass is closed, depending on the specific stove      and the intensity of the blaze inside, the heater can be      damped down to achieve the burn rate you need. (Throughout      the tests we used the stack temperature thermostat      described in issue 77, and we recommend it highly. Besides      having the virtues reported in that article, the automatic      control markedly smooths the temperature curve of the      catalysts . . . eliminating many of the sharp rises and      drops in temperature that normally occur in a converter. As      a result, catalyst life should be extended when the      thermostat is used.)    </p>    <p>      You'll probably find that mounting a surface temperature      thermometer on the stove's back, just above the position of      the converters, will be an important aid in monitoring      catalyst performance. On one cast-iron stove that we've      equipped with converters, a thermometer set in that      location rises to better than 800°F soon after the      converter lights off. And should the catalyst go out for      some reason, we've found the thermometer to be the only      <em>easy</em> way to tell.    </p>    <p>      Besides, we think you'll find it interesting to watch such      an indication of the converters at work. The pointer will      hang up in that 800°F range for several hours and then      gradually drop as the makeup of the fuel changes over the      course of the burn cycle. During the hours immediately      after loading, the catalyst will be very active . . .      handling the volatile hydrocarbons being released from the      wood. Later, when the bulk of the burnable combustion waste      is carbon monoxide, temperatures will drop, but the      catalyst will still be doing its job . . . for almost as      long as coals remain in the firebox.    </p>    <p>      After the charge of wood burns down - but not out      - you can open the bypass, add more fuel, and then      close the bypass immediately. Once the heater's mass is up      to temperature, the converters will be much more forgiving      of occasional blasts of chilly air and should relight      themselves easily.    </p>    <p>      As a final precaution when using catalytic converters,      you'll have to avoid burning anything but natural wood . .      . and perhaps a little newsprint ( <em>without</em> colored      ink) to help light your fires. Materials such as coal, wood      pellets, paper with colored ink, tires, plastics, and      treated or painted lumber, may "poison" the catalyst and      render it ineffective.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO GET CONVERTERED</strong>    </p>    <p>      Until recently, it hasn't been easy for an individual to      acquire catalytic converters for a do-it-yourself design.      The major catalytic converter manufacturers have found it      logistically easy (and profitable) to deal only with stove      manufacturers. That way, the stove builders handle warranty      arrangements, and the catalyst producers have the      discretion of approving stove designs before delivering      converters . . . which assures both safety and good      performance.    </p>    <p>      Now, however, there are two sources of supply open to      MOTHER-readers who wish to build a retrofit unit like the      one shown here. First, Buck Stove has offered to sell pairs      of rectangular converters to MOTHER-readers - through      its dealer network - for less than $100. (Naturally,      that company has the utmost confidence in the design.)      Also, NuTech, Inc., a firm which the research team dealt      with extensively during development and which makes a      retrofit package of its own, has a similar offer. Check      your yellow pages for Buck Stove Energy Centers (or write      to the main offices at Dept. TMEN, P.O. Drawer 8789,      Asheville, North Carolina 28814), or write to Nu-Tech,      Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 908, East Greenwich, Rhode Island      02818.    </p>    <p>      When you stop and add up the time and money you expend      cutting wood and cleaning your chimney, we're pretty sure      that - no matter who you are - you'll find that      a do-it-yourself catalyst conversion will pay you back for      its cost in two years or less. (After all, the going rate      for chimney sweeping alone is $40 or more.) And if you      don't feel up to building your own package (although the      actual metalworking skills involved really aren't all that      difficult), you might think about buying a retrofit unit or      even a complete stove. With the dollar benefits to base      your decision on, you can take satisfaction in knowing that      you're helping to keep our air clean.    </p>
