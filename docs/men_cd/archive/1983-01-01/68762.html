                <p>      <em>When it comes to recycling, there's no end to the ideas      people can come up with. Here's . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Marlin Spike Werner    </h5>        <p>      It breaks my heart to think of all the waste that's      constantly dumped on our poor planet. Consequently, I'm      always seeking ways to divert used containers and other      castoffs to new purposes. And though it may be considered      tooting my own horn, I must say that I'm particularly proud      of my latest achievement . . . the plastic-jug bugle.    </p>    <p>      To make the "bell" section of this madcap musical      instrument, simply cut the top off a one-gallon plastic      jug, just below the handle. Then, for the bugle's "throat",      thread a 93" length of 1/2" (outside diameter) vinyl tubing      through the handle, directing it upward from the bottom,      and secure it with rubber cement or caulking. (This may      look peculiar, but nobody ever said a bugle's throat      <em>has</em> to come into the back of the bell!)    </p>    <p>      I've experimented with two kinds of mouthpiece for this      homemade horn. The one shown here is made from a small      plastic container that once held a roll of Kodacolor film.      I simply cut a 7/16" hole through the can's bottom to      accommodate the free end of the vinyl throat (make sure the      tube fits snugly), and another hole in its cap. (You'll      have to experiment with the size of this playing hole,      however, in order to suit it to the bugler's pucker.)    </p>    <p>      A different type of mouthpiece can be made by cementing a      1/2" plastic pipe fitting, instead of the film can, on the      end of the tubing . . . but while this arrangement looks      more refined and is less troublesome to make, it doesn't      allow for pucker variations. Bear in mind, though -      regardless of which version you try - that all the      connections must be airtight.    </p>    <p>      The basic pitch of my unusual noisemaker can be varied by      changing the length of the tubing. In fact, if the throat      is <em>very</em> long, you'll have - instead of a      plastic bugle - a "flexible flagon" French horn.    </p>    <p>      So experiment! After all, the materials you need certainly      aren't hard to come by. And who knows . . . you just might      end up with the world's best "plastic jug band"!    </p>

[2] The throat is inserted into the lower end of the container's handle, and the pitch can be varied by adjusting the length of the tubing. [3] A plastic film-can mouthpiece should be designed to suit the bugler's pucker
