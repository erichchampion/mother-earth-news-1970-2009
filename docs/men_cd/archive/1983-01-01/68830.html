                <p>      <em>If the woodstove you depend on chronically backpuffs,      here's a simple means of modifying rather than blowing,      your stack.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Richard A. Ford    </h5>        <p>      One chilly morning, as my family hacked and coughed and      waved away the plumes of smoke that the woodstove was      belching into our kitchen, it occurred to me that building      a new top for the chimney might cure the heater's draft      problems.    </p>        <p>      And as I explored that notion, I became convinced that a      chimney cap designed to create a venturi effect would be      the answer to my problem. Basically, a venturi is a tube      with a constricted, throatlike passage that increases the      velocity and lowers the pressure of whatever moves through      it. I reasoned that if I were able to incorporate such a      passage into my chimney, the exiting flue gases would be      speeded up to such an extent that the once sluggish wood      smoke could overcome the pressure exerted by the outside      air and be expelled efficiently from the top . . . instead      of backing up and plaguing members of my household as they      sat around the kitchen table trying to eat.    </p>    <p>      Then, entirely by chance, I literally <em>unearthed</em>      the means of translating my design from imagination to      rooftop reality. While cleaning out the pig yard, you see,      I found several disk blades that had broken free from a      harrow . . . and the idea of using the smooth, curved      earth-cutters to form the cap took shape.    </p>    <p>      The accompanying photo and diagram help to explain how I      tackled my project. I used two lightweight 14"-diameter      disks (you could substitute the convex and concave ends of      a water heater tank, with the edges smoothed to reduce air      drag) and spaced the rounds about five inches apart by      welding three 1/2"-diameter steel rods in place near the      outside edges of the disks. (Since the blades are usually      made of highcarbon steel, I've found that low-hydrogen      welding electrodes are necessary to produce good, solid      joints.)    </p>    <p>      Next, I made a steel collar that <em>barely</em> slipped      over my existing flue ... and gouged a hole out of the      bottom blade to match the size of the new support. Then I      welded the collar to the bottom blade and pressed in some      1/2" wire mesh to discourage the birds. With that done, I      plugged the former axle hole in the upper disk . . . using      a wide, thick rubber washer and a nut, bolt, and flat      washer.    </p>    <p>      Finally, I installed the whole cap on the flue and secured      it with three sheet metal screws. (Guy wires and      turnbuckles could be used to help stabilize the setup.)    </p>    <p>      I'm happy to report that my jerry-built flue cap has      eliminated the woodstove's noxious backpuffing. And if your      woodburner is giving you similar trouble, I'd suggest that      you consider constructing a simple little device like mine.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Although Mr. Ford's design does not      constitute a true venturi, a chimney cap of this kind can      be effective in some circumstances.</em>    </p>
