        <p><em>Finding a suitable "zoo" to buy your "white elephant" may not be as difficult as you think!</em></p><p>Almost all of us - at one time or another - will find ourselves in possession of items for which we have no real use. Now one of the most <em>popular</em> ways of disposing of such "white elephants" is to hold a garage sale. But before following that plan of action, you should know that some of the items regularly disposed of at these events <em>could</em> be turned over for a much larger profit . . . if their owners knew <em>who</em> to sell them to.</p><p>The fact is, you can name just about any class of objects - rocks, matchbook covers, empty bottles, paperback books - and odds are (especially if it's reasonably old) that <em>somebody</em> would be interested in adding it to a collection. The spectrum of items sought by collectors is far broader than most people realize!</p><p>For example, a recent issue of the <em>Antique Trader</em> contained ads from individuals who wanted to buy - among other things - old fishing reels, pre-1942 BB guns, feed sacks, Maltese Cross butter molds, thimble holders, Navaho rugs, insurance company signs, antique clothing, Boy Scout patches, bus tokens, books about tropical fish, corkscrews, children's pedal tractors, bread end labels, paper dolls, wooden duck decoys, doorknobs, and pre-1955 Hawaiian shirts. As you can see, many of these items are exactly the sort of "junk" one expects to pick up (or sell) dirt cheap at a rummage sale or flea market. That's because to <em>most</em> folks, such goods are all but worthless.</p><p>Therefore, in order to get the best price for your white elephants, you'll have to reach the individuals who'll value them most. For instance, a lot of folks would likely throw away an empty "Soul Mellow Yellow" beer can if they found one when - say - cleaning the basement. But according to Thomas Toepfer - author of the American Beer Can Encyclopedia - that container could be worth $200 to a collector. And the child next door <em>might</em> offer you a quarter for an old Marlo Thomas doll . . . but find the right buyer, and the toy may bring as much as $125. Even something as seemingly ordinary as a souvenir blanket that's been passed down in your family could turn out to be more valuable than you'd imagine. For example, I once saw a pre-1900 Navaho blanket sell for $12,000 at an auction.</p><p><strong>COLLECTOR'S NOTES</strong></p><p>Of course you'll have to do a little research in order to locate folks who might have a special interest in your potential collectibles. And a good way to begin is to look through a publication that serves their particular interests. Some of these magazines cover a wide range of items, while others limit their content to a specific category. Here's a sampling of such periodicals. (A public library will likely have - or be able to obtain, on loan - copies of many of them.)</p><p><strong>A B BOOKMAN'S WEEKLY</strong><br />Dept. TMEN<br />P.O.

For example, did you know that the <em>picture sleeves</em> from some 45-RPM records are worth more than the disks themselves . . . or that most general-interest magazines of the 1970's (and earlier) commonly sell for about 25 cents to $1.00 each, while many of the <em>automobile</em> advertisements inside those same periodicals could bring you more than $3.00 apiece?</p><p>The following lineup of titles includes a good number of the more popular reference works:</p><p><em>American Beer Can Encyclopedia</em> by Thomas Toepfer<br /><em>The American Postcard Guide to Tuck</em> by Sally S. Carver<br /><em>American Premium Guide to Coin Operated Machines: Identification and Values</em> by Jerry Ayliffe<br /><em>Clock Guide: Identification With Prices (Book 2)</em> by Robert W. Miller<br /><em>Collectibles: The Nostalgia Collector's Bible</em> by Bert R. Sugar<br /><em>Collecting Toys: A Collector's Identification & Value Guide</em> by Richard O'Brien<br /><em>The Collector's Encyclopedia of Barbie Dolls and Collectibles</em> by Sibyl DeWein and Joan Ashabraner<br /><em>Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons</em> by Sally Luscomb<br /><em>Collector's Encyclopedia of Depression Glass</em> by Gene Florence<br /><em>The Comic Book Price Guide</em> by Robert M. Overstreet<br /><em>Flea Market Handbook</em> by Robert G. Miner<br /><em>Graniteware Identification and Value Guide</em> by Fred and Rose Booher<br /><em>Greenberg's Price Guide to Lionel Trains</em> by Bruce Greenberg<br /><em>The Investor's Guide to American Convertible and Special-Interest Automobiles, 1946-1976</em> by Charles Webb<br /><em>Norman Rockwell Art and Collectibles: Identification and Values</em> by Carl F. Luckey<br /><em>The Official Price Guide to Collectible Rock Records</em> by Randall C. Hill<br /><em>Old Advertising</em> by Jim Cope<br /><em>One Thousand Fruit Jars</em> by Bill Schroeder<br /><em>Original Record Collectors Price Guide: Record Album Price Guide</em> by Jerry Osborne and Bruce Hamilton<br /><em>The Paperback Price Guide</em> by Kevin Hancer<br /><em>Patricia Smith's Doll Values, Antique to Modern</em> by Patricia Smith<br /><em>Planter's Peanuts Collectibles With Current Prices</em> by Richard Reddock<br /><em>The Sport Americana Baseball Card Price Guide (No. 2)</em> by James Beckett and Dennis W. Eckes<br /><em>The Teddy Bear</em> Catalog by Peggy and Alan Bialosky<br /><em>Wallace-Homestead Price Guide to American Country Antiques</em> by Don and Carol Raycraft<br /><em>The Warner Collectors' Guide to American Quilts</em> by Phyllis Haders</p><p>Actually, although price guides are useful in determining the <em>approximate</em> value of any collectibles that you may have to sell, the condition of the items - and the current demand - will also affect their market price. And naturally, you just won't find <em>some</em> valuable things listed in the reference books at all. The best way to determine the worth of obscure, less popular collectibles is to read the classified advertising sections of collector publications.</p><p>Conventions for collectors offer lots of opportunities for sellers to reach potential buyers, too. Such events are held throughout the country, and usually focus on just one kind of item (perhaps dolls, records, movie memorabilia, or comic books) . .. although some conventions will feature a broad range of goods. Again, the various publications listed here will help you find out when and where such gatherings are held.</p><p>Discovering "where to go with what you've got" can be, itself, the start of a very interesting hobby . . . one that might take you beyond the limits of merely cleaning out your attic (perhaps to cleaning out <em>other</em> folks' clutter in search of "old gold"). Just remember that whether an object is considered "junk" or a "jewel" depends solely on who is looking at it, and on the price that person is willing to pay.</p><p> </p>
