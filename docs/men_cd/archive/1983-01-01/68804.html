                <p>      <em>An indoor pool - with this system - can      actually pay for itself in reduced utility bills!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Rae Donaldson</h5>        <p>      Five years ago, when my husband and I installed a 16' X 32'      vinyl swimming pool in a room enclosed in translucent      fiberglass, we weren't being merely self-indulgent. I      needed that "luxury" for therapy, you see, since I'd      earlier developed a muscular/neurological disease that      <em>only</em> a daily routine of swimming and pool exercise      would help to control.    </p>    <p>      Of course, I'll be the first to admit that having a heated      pool was a real treat, because we live on the cool Oregon      coast where - during much of the year - the      ocean water is icy enough to turn swimmers blue. And      because the indoor facility was attached to our garage, we      could even get to it without braving our winter rains,      which occur often enough to dump 60" to 90" of moisture on      our part of the state each year.    </p>    <p>      At first, we were quite able to afford the extra energy      consumed by the pool's electric water heater, but -      little by little - the utility rates in our area      climbed. By January of 1981 we were paying 43% more for      electricity than we had when the pool was built . . . and      our city announced an upcoming 25% annual increase. Since      runaway inflation was already playing havoc with our      retirement budget, we simply couldn't handle those      increasing costs. Yet I didn't want to sacrifice my health      <em>or</em> take on the medical expense of outside therapy,      so I decided to look for an alternative way to heat our      swimming water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A FORTUNATE MEETING</strong>    </p>        <p>      To my dismay, research soon revealed that oil heat was even      more expensive than electricity, and natural gas isn't      available in our area. Then, following the suggestion of      several friends, I investigated solar heating methods, only      to learn that we'd have to spend $4,000 to $12,000 for a      system that would still need frequent backup in our      commonly cloudy area.    </p>    <p>      In short, I was just about to give up when I was introduced      to a young man named Michael Lindsay, who - with his      father - owns the Lindsay Furnace Service (Dept.      TMEN, 1239 Andrew Street, Coos Bay, Oregon 97420). Mike was      intrigued by our problem . . . enough so that he offered to      come to our house to study the situation, at no cost to us.      Suffice it to say, we accepted his offer. Mike came out and      - after a lot of measuring and muttering to himself      - finally announced, "What you need is a heat pump."      That was an idea we'd never considered, so our expert set      out to explain what he had in mind.    </p>    <p>      "The heat pump concept dates back to the 1850's," he told      us, "but efficient, well-serviced models weren't developed      until after the 1973 oil crisis. The principle is basically      the same as that used in a refrigerator, where heat is      removed from inside the box and discharged into the room. A      home air conditioning unit performs in a similar manner, by      removing heat from the house and discharging it outside.      And if this operation is reversed - if heat is      removed from the outdoors, concentrated (in effect), and      funneled into the living space - you have what's      commonly called a heat pump.    </p>    <p>      "In your case, there's a considerable heat gain in your      fiberglassed enclosure, even on cloudy days, and that      warmth can be efficiently transferred to the pool. I      suggest, though, that instead of the conventional airsource      heat pump, we install a water-source model designed to      utilize the warmth stored in wells, lakes, and streams.      This type is approximately three times as energy-efficient      as an electrical heating system. It's similar in operating      principle to an air-source unit, but exchanges heat with      water rather than air. In fact, we can use the warmed air      in the pool room to heat your swimming pool, then -      while we're at it - we can use the water in your pool      to help warm your house!"    </p>    <p>      As you can imagine, that last bit of news really made us      sit up and listen, and Mike - seeing our interest      - went on enthusiastically: "Since the swimming pool      provides a perfect heat sink, with a good amount of thermal      storage capability, I'll design a reverse into the system.      Heat from the pool can then be extracted and transferred      - through air ducts - to your home. This will      cause the pool temperature to drop by only a few degrees,      and as soon as the house is up to temperature, you can go      back to heating the pool."    </p>    <p>      Mike's proposal was pretty attractive to us, especially      since we were depending on electric baseboard heat in our      house . . . and that cost, too, was getting out of hand.    </p>    <p>      After making a few more calculations, Mike came up with a      $5,000 estimate for the dual-purpose installation. We      thanked him and told him we'd be in touch. Then we talked      it over . . . juggled our budget a good bit . . . studied      brochures on heat pumps . . . and finally decided to      install the suggested system.    </p>        <p>      <strong>AN IDEA MADE REAL</strong>    </p>    <p>      Two days later, Mike and his assistant Bill arrived with      our heat pump. The 22" X 27" X 44" unit is similar to an      electric furnace in appearance. But before it could be      hooked up, holes had to be cut - through concrete      block - from the garage to the pool room. After that,      the return and supply ducts were mounted side by side in      the wall. Next, Mike designed a motor-driven damper and      installed it in the ductwork to direct the air.    </p>    <p>      "When the pool needs heat," he explained, "the flow pattern      will be such that heat from the air in the pool room will      be transferred to the water. Then, when the thermostat      signals that your living quarters require heat, the airflow      will switch to the house circuit, and water from the pool      will be delivered to the pump's heat exchanger, where the      house air will pass over it and warm up."    </p>    <p>      Finally, aquastats equipped with sensors were plumbed into      the pool under a deck board. These cut in the heater      whenever the water temperature drops below 80°F, which      I find a very comfortable temperature for swimming.    </p>    <p>      We were quite excited - and just a little nervous      - when Mike turned on the heat pump. Bill held a      thermometer in the pipe that began shooting the warmed      water into the pool, and the reading was 97°F. What's      more, the rate at which that water was being pumped      (recirculated) measured nine gallons per minute. The system      was a success . . . in fact, it exceeded even Mike's      calculations!    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM POOL TO HOUSE</strong>    </p>        <p>      With the first part of the plan functioning perfectly, it      was time to arrange for transferring heat from the pool to      the house. To do so, the men constructed ducts (heavily      insulated to insure efficiency and quiet) and strapped them      to the basement ceiling, using turning vanes at any 90°      corner.    </p>    <p>      Then Bill cut a large outlet in our entry hall, upstairs,      and covered it with an attractive grille. A return duct in      the wall of the stairwell leading to the basement allows      circulation of air. We can, anytime we choose to do so,      install more ducts to move warmth into the bedrooms and      baths. We can even add an attachment to the heat pump that      will preheat our domestic hot water supply, and -      budget allowing - we've decided to try that next. (If      you live in a sunnier climate than we do, you may be      interested in knowing that Mike is sure a system like ours      could be used quite effectively with a solariheated      swimming pool.)    </p>    <p>      It would be advantageous to have a larger pool . . . one      with the volume to store an adequate amount of heat for our      house during long periods of inclement weather. As it is,      we did occasionally have to fall back on our electric heat      last winter . . . but we're not complaining! After all,      this heating system decreased our utility bills -      compared with the previous year - by half during the      rainy winter months . . . and by <em>two-thirds</em> during      the summer!    </p>
