                <p>      <em>With a few good recipes, some common sense, and a      little bit of get-up-and-go, you can be . . .</em>    </p>    <h1 id=" title">      AT HOME IN THE BAKING BUSINESS    </h1>    <h5 id="byline">by       Gail Wells    </h5>        <p>      Do you make your own bread? If so, the delectable flavor      and aroma of hot-from-the-oven loaves are familiar to you.      There are many folks, however, who have never even tasted      - let alone <em>baked</em> - homemade bread.    </p>    <p>      Well, <em>you</em> can introduce such people to the joys of      "the staff of life" . . . watch their nostrils quiver at      the irresistible fragrance . . . know they're savoring all      that whole-grain goodness . . . <em>and</em> make yourself      a tidy part-time income to boot! How do I know? Because I      do it . . . you see, baking and selling bread is something      an "ordinary" housewife like me can do to fight the      recession blues.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTING STARTED</strong>    </p>    <p>      Some people do market studies, and investigate all manner      of possibilities, before setting up in business. Well, I      wish I could say that's how I got started, but it wasn't.      The fact is that baking for profit more or less crept up on      me. My enterprise actually began when a friend stopped by      to visit one day as I was preparing our family's bread.      Well, she was so tantalized by the aroma that I insisted      she take a loaf home with her.    </p>    <p>      "My family <em>devoured</em> your bread!" she exclaimed the      next time I saw her. "If you'll bake me two loaves a week,      I'll pay you anything you want to charge!"    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, her offer <em>was</em> tempting. After      all, baking two more loaves a week wouldn't make a lick of      difference in my schedule, and a little extra money would      certainly come in handy . . . so I agreed.    </p>    <p>      But the next thing I knew, her boss wanted a weekly loaf.      Then her sister asked for one . . . her babysitter wanted      two . . . and other folks began to get a "whiff" of my      activities. In short, I soon figured out that there was a      large - and largely untapped - market for      homebaked bread, so I gathered my recipes and embarked on a      new career.    </p>    <p>      My preliminary strategy session consisted simply of      calculating what each loaf cost me. Then I listed a few of      my favorite kinds of bread, together with prices that I      thought were fair, and had that sheet copied. Finally, I      took a deep breath and got a business license under the      name "Gail's Bread Alone".    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO MARKET, TO MARKET. . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      Since I was officially "in trade", it was time to try to      round up the customers. To begin, I gave a bread list to      each of my friends and asked them to spread the word (and      to buy a loaf or two). Next, I posted the sheets on every      bulletin board I could find, and took copies into all the      restaurants (a grand total of five) in our little town.      Soon the orders began to come in.    </p>    <p>      When summer arrived, I rented a space at the Saturday      farmers' market in a larger town nearby. The modest $2.00      weekly investment paid off handsomely . . . I was able to      pocket between $50 and $60 nearly every weekend.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, the farmers' market introduced me to the      delights of barter. One Saturday I parted with a dozen      cinnamon rolls and two loaves of bread in return for a      ferocious banty hen and her nine chicks! Other friendly      swaps kept me well supplied with such luscious local fare      as blackberry honey, eggs, and sweet corn. I was sorry when      the farmers' market closed in the fall . . . but my      home-based enterprise continued - and continues      - to grow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAKING IT WORK</strong>    </p>    <p>      I was an enthusiastic home baker before I went into      business, and I still am, but producing goods for sale does      involve a little extra effort. Here are some tips that can      help you do what needs to be done to "earn some bread" with      your own homemade specialties.    </p>    <p>      [1] If your state or county issues licenses, get one. It's      not hard to do so, probably not expensive (mine costs $25 a      year), and may well be mandatory. A license will testify      that your kitchen is sanitary and that you're serious about      your work. Best of all, it gives you the privilege of      buying your raw materials at wholesale prices.    </p>    <p>      Home kitchens might be licensed through a state      agricultural department (as they are here in Oregon) or      through a county or state health department. Try the health      departments first: If they don't issue licenses, they can      likely tell you who does. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: MOTHER'S      state, North Carolina, doesn't require a license for a home      kitchen . . . but it does have regulations - which      are enforced by inspectors from the Food and Drug      Protection Division of the Department of Agriculture      - regarding the facilities and procedures that may be      used in home food-processing operations.]</em>    </p>    <p>      By the way, your license will probably cover only "plain"      baked items . . . that is, bread, rolls, bagels, etc. It's      best not to sell any cream pies, custard-filled pastries,      or similar items that could spoil and make someone sick.    </p>    <p>      [2] Maintain good records! This is vital . . . since such      data will probably be the only tool that can tell you      whether or not you're making a profit on your goods.      Furthermore, some of your expenses can be deducted from      your bread income at tag time (yes, you do have to give      Uncle Sam his cut), but you won't be able to take advantage      of deductions that you <em>forget</em> . . . or can't      verify.    </p>    <p>      Record-keeping needn't be a formidable chore if you simply      make it a regular practice. For instance, before I bake      anything for sale, I figure the cost of the ingredients and      make up a price sheet for each recipe. Of course, that      calculation does involve spending some time weighing and      measuring the contents of standard-sized packages of flour,      spices, etc. so that I know exactly how many cups, ounces,      or whatever are contained in each package. Once that's      done, though, I simply divide the price of the package by      the number of cups or ounces to arrive at the cost of each      unit. Then it's easy to figure up what I've spent for the      ingredients in any one recipe.    </p>    <p>      I also write down all my orders in a 35 cents receipt book      - the kind with carbon paper attached - and      total them at the end of each month. I then subtract the      ingredients cost of each order, and my mileage expense for      the month (which I record in a little notebook in my car),      and what's left is <em>my profit</em> !    </p>    <p>      [3] Keep track of your supplies. After all, a frantic dash      to the midnight market to pick up the molasses you thought      you had could really eat into your net income! I shop for      perishables once a week and purchase staples, on a monthly      basis, through a food co-op or (sometimes) a grocery      wholesaler.    </p>    <p>      [4] Stick to what you do best. Early on, I tried to offer      every kind of bread I could think of . . . from bagels and      brioches to Swedish limpa. After a few charred fiascoes,      though, I narrowed my list. My mainstays now are whole      wheat bread, oatmeal bread, and cinnamon rolls.    </p>    <p>      [5] Scout for customers. Distribute your flyers wherever      you can. Get to know potential buyers who work in local      offices, and members of civic clubs that meet over coffee      and - all too often - store-bought, soggy      doughnuts. You can offer such people <em>better</em> fare!      Most areas have craft festivals and farmers' markets going      on much of the year, too . . . just keep your ears open,      read the newspapers, and talk to your local chamber of      commerce to find out about forthcoming opportunities.    </p>    <p>      [6] Don't be afraid to charge a fair price for your wares.      You're providing a product that people probably can't get      everywhere.    </p>    <p>      [7] <em>Bake with love</em> . That may sound corny, but      it's really important. If you lavish the same care on a      to-be-marketed coffeecake as you do on your own family's      bread, the treat will have a special touch that commercial      bakeries can't equal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUMMING UP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Of course, the success of my business can be measured by      answering two questions. First (and most important), do I      like being an entrepreneur? My response to that is an      enthusiastic "you bet"! Then, am I making a living at it?      Well, I have to admit that I'm not getting rich just yet.      After all, my baking is only a part-time job. But there's      plenty of potential for more work. In fact, I recently      marked the first anniversary of Gail's Bread Alone by going      into partnership with two other farm wives. We now call      ourselves the Country Pantry, and we offer just about any      kind of baked goody a person could wish for. We're already      supplying a delicatessen, a catering firm, a women's club,      and several private patrons. Maybe, someday we'll even open      our own bakery. . . but in the meantime we're doing a job      that we - and our customers - like very much.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OUT TO LAUNCH</strong>    </p>    <p>      Chances are that at least some of you will want to try your      hands at baking for sale. Well, here's a recipe to get you      started. You can alter it to suit your own taste, or use it      as is . . . to make eight satisfyingly hearty loaves at a      cost of about 65 cents each (depending on your sources of      supply).    </p>    <p>      <strong>FARMERS' MARKET WHEAT BREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup of honey<br />      1/2 cup of light molasses<br />      2-1/2 cups of dry milk<br />      1/2 cup of oil<br />      3 scant tablespoons of salt<br />      2 cups of rolled oats<br />      2 quarts of water<br />      1/4 cup of active dry yeast<br />      8 eggs<br />      12 cups of whole wheat flour<br />      10 cups of unbleached flour    </p>    <p>      In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Then      stir in 1 quart of boiling water, followed by 1 quart of      cold water. When the mixture has cooled to wrist warmth,      blend in the yeast and allow it to bubble. Now, break in      the eggs and beat the batter vigorously.    </p>    <p>      With that done, add the whole wheat flour - two cups      at a time - and stir the dough until it pulls away      from the sides of the bowl in elastic strands. Next, work      in the unbleached flour, kneading in the last of it before      you turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and      knead it smooth. Then oil a clean bowl, put the dough in,      and let it rise - in a warm spot - to twice its      original bulk (that'll take approximately 50 minutes).    </p>    <p>      After it has risen, turn the dough out and cut it into      eight equal lumps. Shape each one into a loaf and bake them      in greased pans, at 325 °F, for 30 to 40 minutes . . .      or until they're well browned and sound hollow when tapped.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: In the course of our taste test -      which, incidentally, resulted in contented comments and      some busy breakfasting around the office - MOTHER's      baker found that the dough produced higher loaves, with a      somewhat lighter texture, when it was allowed to rise a      second time in the pan before being baked.]</em>    </p>
