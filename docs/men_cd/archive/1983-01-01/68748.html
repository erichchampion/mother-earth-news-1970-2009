        <h5 id="byline">Issue #79 - January/February 1983</h5><p>Folks say that experience is the best teacher, and I suppose they're right. There's no reason, however, why we can't share our lessons with each other . . . that way everybody saves a little bit of the usually expensive "tuition" that the school of hard knocks charges.</p><p>For instance, I recently had an educational experience that I'd like to pass along to you <em>now</em> (before next summer's fruit comes in).</p><p>You see, two years ago I made up a four-gallon batch of rhubarb wine. I bought a brand-new crock for the project, and - let me tell you - that brew turned out just great!</p><p>With a whole heap more confidence, then, I decided to mix myself up <em>seven</em> gallons of the tasty concoction last year. My little crock, of course, wouldn't hold that amount. So I borrowed a larger container from a neighbor, washed it out well, and filled it with my new batch of fixings.</p><p>A couple of days later I found the crock full of smelly, mold-covered liquid.</p><p>Now, I couldn't just <em>throw out</em> all of that potential rhubarb ambrosia, so I consulted the local wine expert. And he had the answer. It seems that my neighbor had made pickles in the crock that I'd borrowed, and pickles - the vintner told me - leave a brine that's nearly impossible to wash out of the slightly porous material of which most crocks are made. That residue prevents fermentation in the wine and turns it moldy.</p><p>All was not lost, however, the old winemaker assured me. He suggested that I scoop all of the growth off my batch, strain the liquid through a coffee filter into a <em>clean</em> crock, and add some more yeast.</p><p>I followed his advice, and two days later the brew took off, just bubbling like mad. The wine isn't done yet, but its flavor is well on the way to recovery . . . and no new mold has formed.</p><p>I was lucky, all right, but <em>you</em> can avoid the problem that caused me all that worry (and extra work) entirely. Just remember what my knowledgeable friend says: "Pickles is pickles and wines is wines, and never the twain should meet."</p>
