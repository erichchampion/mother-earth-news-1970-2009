                    <h5 id="byline">by       Mike Murphy    </h5>    <p>      When the well begins to send up hollow echoes instead of a      steady stream of water - and weather forecasters      start intoning warnings about below-average levels of      precipitation - you know it's time to pay attention      to your family's water-consumption habits. And whether you      live in a drought-prone area where cutbacks have already      been mandated, or ever-increasing water bills are simply      <em>forcing</em> your household to economize, it's a good      idea to do your part to help conserve this rapidly      dwindling limited resource.    </p>    <p>      You'll be happy to know, then, that you can significantly      affect household water use by simply regulating the amount      of the precious liquid that runs down the drain when you      shower. If you live in a house that was built in recent      years, your bathroom is more than likely already equipped      with a water-saving shower head. However, for those who      reside in somewhat older homes, there are reasonably priced      brass washers that can be slipped inside a shower      attachment to constrict the flow. Or - if you'd like      an even <em>lower</em> -cost option - you can modify      your shower head, causing it to use about 75% less water,      by making my 2 cents flow limiter.    </p>    <p>      To put together this almost no-cost adapter, you'll first      have to remove the existing shower head (a crescent wrench      is probably the best tool for the job). With that done,      rummage through your workshop odds and ends (or pay a visit      to the local hardware store or a plumbing supply house) to      find a rubber washer, <em>without</em> a hole in the      middle, of about the same diameter as the inside of the      pipe that connects with the nozzle. Such washers are      usually priced five for a dime . . . or about 2 cents      apiece.    </p>    <p>      The next step is as tough as this project is going to get.      Using a pair of snips, cut a number of little wedges      - all the way around the rubber disk - from the      outside of the circle and not quite to its center.    </p>    <p>      Now, insert the saw-edged washer into the shower head as      far as it will go, and refasten the whole affair to the      connecting waterline. Finally, try out your modification:      If the flow is <em>too</em> constricted, you'll need to      disassemble the fitting and cut deeper notches in the      washer. If the flow has not been reduced enough, however,      you should start anew with another washer (even though      doing so will inflate the project's cost to a full 4 cents)      and remove <em>smaller</em> slices this time.    </p>    <p>      Since I retrofitted my shower head, I've found that the      water flow is about 25% of what it was before . . . and the      spray has the same force regardless of how far I turn the      faucet handles. All in all, this is one project that I      think has really given me my 2 cents worth!    </p>
