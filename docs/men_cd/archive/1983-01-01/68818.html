                <p>      <em>As Europeans already know, you can lengthen your      harvest and pleasure your palate with . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Mary Preus Hamilton</h5>    <p>      Tantalizing to the taste buds and easy to grow, the leek (      <em>Allium porrum</em> ) is all too frequently neglected by      gardeners in North America. In fact, I'd never even tasted      these onionlike morsels before I married an Englishman, but      now that I've been introduced to them, neither my garden      nor my kitchen is often without a goodly supply.    </p>    <p>      The leek has a rich history of admirers . . . dating back      at least to the Roman emperor Nero, and including the      English playwright Shakespeare . . . as well as a      respectable portion of the population of Wales, the country      which chose the vegetable as its national emblem (just as      Ireland's is the shamrock and England's the rose). This      internationally popular <em>Allium</em> is slightly milder      in flavor than its cousin the common yellow onion (which      makes it a welcome addition to any food from soup to salad)      and is relatively easy to grow (thanks largely to its      frost-hardy nature).    </p>    <p>      <strong>SEEDTIME . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although it prefers rich, crumbly earth, "poor man's      asparagus" (as the French, who are among the most avid      leek-lovers, call it) can be grown in almost any soil and      almost any part of the country. There are a number of      varieties available, which tend to differ primarily in      size. The large types are best for purees, stews, and soups      (and can even be stuffed) . . . while the smaller specimens      are delicious when served in salads or cooked whole.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: A number of seed companies sell leeks,      including Burpee, Park, and Stokes. See page 26 for the      addresses of these and other firms.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Leeks are very tolerant of frost and thus thrive in the      colder parts of the country as well as in more temperate      climes. In those areas where the winters are mild, they can      even be "stored" in the garden all through the cold months      and gathered as needed.    </p>    <p>      There are about as many ways to "rear" leeks as there are      gardeners. The bare-bones method involves simply putting      the seeds in the ground as soon as the soil is workable in      early spring. If your aim is to grow jumbo leeks, though,      you may want to start them indoors during the winter, and      then about March (be sure the seedlings have developed      second leaves) transplant them into your garden. A few      months or so after the seeds are sown, your crop should      have reached peak size for harvesting . . . but leeks are      edible at every stage of their development, so do go ahead      and pull a few whenever you have a yen for them.    </p>    <p>      The seeds should be planted about a quarter-inch deep and a      thumb's width apart. You'll need to thin them to some six      inches apart as they mature, but when you do so, take care      not to brush soil on the leaves of the growing stalks that      remain. And don't toss the culls over the back fence . . .      add them to that big salad you were thinking about having      for lunch.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to provide your seedlings with plenty of water (the      equivalent of at least an inch a week) and to weed the bed      regularly. Aside from such routine chores, about all you'll      have to do is wait till they're ready to eat . . . we've      found our leeks to be all but insect- and disease-free .    </p>    <p>      <strong>. . . AND HARVEST</strong>    </p>    <p>      As soon as the first sharp frost hits, your leeks will      pretty much cease to grow. If you live in a mild climate,      however, you can just leave them in the ground all winter .      . . piling a little mulch around them for protection during      especially chilly or frosty nights. Otherwise, it's best to      collect the vegetables and either set them in soil in a      greenhouse or root cellar, wrap them in plastic and pop      them into the refrigerator (where they'll keep for about      three weeks), or steam-blanch and freeze them. Whatever      method of storage you choose, you ought to be able to enjoy      your leek harvest for most of the winter . . . perhaps long      enough to try some of the following recipes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LEEKS AU GRATIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's an easy yet appetizing dish that's a favorite with      my family <em>and</em> our dinner guests. To make it, wash      6 leeks thoroughly, cut off the roots and the tough top      leaves, and slice the vegetables lengthwise (or chop them      into bite-sized chunks) into a skillet. Add just enough      boiling water to keep the pieces from sticking . . . cover      the pan . . . and let them simmer until they're tender,      about 15 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Now, arrange the cooked leeks in a shallow baking dish and      sprinkle them with 2 cups of freshly grated cheddar or      Italian cheese. Add sea salt (or powdered kelp, if you can      find it at an Oriental market or natural foods store) and      pepper to taste, then pop the casserole into a low oven      - about 300°F, but keep an eye on it -      until the cheese melts.    </p>    <p>      For a heartier dish, try adding tomato wedges, green      olives, tofu, or cooked ham . . . or perhaps simmering a      few stalks of celery with the leeks.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COCK-A-LEEKIE</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is a traditional Scottish soup . . . in which a      surprising combination of dried apricots, prunes,      vegetables, and chicken produces a special taste treat.      Start by simmering a 3-pound stewing chicken in 3 quarts of      water with 4 peppercorns and 2 whole cloves. Cook the bird      for 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until it's tender. Then bone it      and cut the meat into pieces.    </p>    <p>      Next, slice 6 leeks into inch-long sections, and add them      to the stock with 2 teaspoons of sea salt or kelp powder,      1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, 1/2 cup of raw brown rice, 10      prunes (pitted), and 10 dried apricot halves. (If you like,      you can also add 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley.) Let the      pot simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, until the rice is tender      and the flavors are blended. Then add the chicken pieces,      let them warm through, and serve up the soup.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LEEK PIE</strong>    </p>    <p>      This savory entrée -in which the country      goodness of eggs and milk is complemented by the brisk      flavors of leeks and bacon - is very nearly the      national dish of Wales. To whip one up, first line a piepan      with your favorite pastry, brush the shell with beaten egg,      and bake it for 5 minutes in a 425 °F oven. Meanwhile,      slice 8 medium leeks into bitesized pieces wand steam them      for about 10 minutes (don't forget to take the pie shell      out on time!) . . . drain them well . . . place them in the      crust . . . and add 4 slices of bacon (chopped). Beat 3      eggs with 2 cups of milk or cream, 1/2 teaspoon of kelp or      sea salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg. Pour the egg mixture      over the bacon and leeks, and put the pan into a 350°F      oven for 10 minutes before turning the heat down to      325° and letting the pie continue to bake until the      filling has set (about 20 minutes more).    </p>    <p>      This hearty dish makes a delicious light dinner when served      with fresh greens or fruit salad.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LEEKS VINAIGRETTE</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you're in the mood for an easy-to-prepare treat that      tastes as if you'd worked on it all day, serve leeks      marinated in a classic vinaigrette dressing. Just combine      1/2 cup of olive oil . . . 1/4 cup of wine vinegar (or good      cider vinegar) . . . 1 teaspoon each of minced fresh      tarragon, parsley, and chives . . . 1/4 teaspoon of paprika      or black pepper . . . and I teaspoon of sea salt or kelp.      Then cut 6 leeks into 4-inch lengths, steam them for about      10 minutes, transfer them to a serving dish, and pour the      dressing over them while they're still hot. Let the      vegetables marinate for at least 3 hours, then serve them      garnished with chopped herbs of your choice.    </p>    <p>      Of course, there are literally dozens of other ways to      prepare "poor man's asparagus" (many of which you'll      undoubtedly come up with yourself, once you're better      acquainted with these garden treasures). So if you're not      already growing them, plan to include a few in this year's      garden . . . and I'll bet this noble immigrant will become      a mainstay in your menus as it has in ours.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For further information about leeks,      including many more recipes and tips on harvesting your own      seeds, you might enjoy author Mary Hamilton's</em> The Leek      Cookbook <em>(Madrona Publishers, 1982, $5.95).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And for more ideas on cold-weather</em> Allium      <em>-eating, see the article on page 144.</em>    </p>
