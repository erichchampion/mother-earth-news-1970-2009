                <p>      <em>Did you know that there're more uses for a shelled ear      of corn that you can shake a stalk at?</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Reb ecca A. Buchmeyer    </h5>        <p>      At this time of year - when last summer's corn crop      has been shelled, providing the livestock with a cribful of      winter feed and the family with enough cornmeal to last      until the next growing season - my clan and I are      always faced with a veritable <em>mountain</em> of cobs.      And while those kernelless cores wouldn't command much of a      price at the market, we've discovered that the stripped      ears are surprisingly useful (and therefore downright      <em>valuable</em> ) on our homestead. In fact, once you've      tried out some of the ideas that follow, you'll likely      wonder how you ever got along <em>without</em> keeping a      cob or two on hand!    </p>    <p>      To begin with, we've found that it's helpful to store a few      of the abrasive ears next to the barbecue grill. A cob's      nubby-textured surface is great for cleaning greasy wire      racks . . . and when the job is done, the dirty scrubber      can be dried to serve as fuel for the next cookout, or as a      fire starter in our woodstove.    </p>    <p>      A corncob can serve as a clothes brush, too. For example,      if you've ever traipsed through the woods, you're probably      familiar with those dry little burrs called beggar's-lice      that have a habit of clinging to your clothing. Well,      whenever I come home covered with the stickers, I don't      waste my time picking the pesky seeds off one by one. I      simply grab a corncob and scrub them off with a few quick      swipes. The same tool can also come in handy when you pull      your Sunday suit out of the closet, only to discover that      it's been hanging next to your mohair sweater!    </p>    <p>      With the arrival of spring, corncobs make ideal      seed-starter pots, and they're a good bit less expensive      than their store-bought counterparts, too. To make one of      the all-natural containers, simply cut the cob into 2" or      3" lengths. Next - using a sharp pocketknife -      whittle out the inside of each section, leaving just a thin      bottom layer . . . fill the cob cups with compost . . . and      plant your seeds. Later, when the shoots are large enough      to be assigned a permanent spot in the garden, simply      scrape open the closed end of each cylinder, and plant the      whole shebang! The cob will decompose in time and return      its nutrients to the soil.    </p>    <p>      Come summer, when the youngsters are out of school and      looking for some excitement (and your patience is beginning      to wear a bit thin), those nubby cylinders will prove      useful again. Corncobs, with a few alterations, can become      splendid lawn darts. Your teenagers may enjoy making these      toys by themselves, but the smaller fry will likely require      some assistance in "cobbling up" the project.    </p>    <p>      To make a set of darts, you'll need four to six corncobs,      three good-sized feathers - with a slight curve to      them, if possible - for each cob (your farm fowl      could lend a helping wing here), and one 3"- to 4"-long      stick (or you could use a large nail) per dart.    </p>    <p>      Once you've assembled the materials, position the three      feathers so that they curve outward, and push the tips of      the quills into the wider end of the cob, as shown in the      photo. (You may have to use a small finishing nail to start      the holes.) Once the dart's "wings" are in place, insert      the 3" to 4" stick in the <em>narrow</em> end of the cob,      leaving a point that's 1-1/2" to 2" long. (You might want      to sharpen the exposed end of the stick.) Finally, draw a      target in the dirt or on a large sheet of paper, and      - after discussing safety precautions with the young      competitors - join your family in a game of outdoor      darts!    </p>    <p>      Of course, no article concerning corncob projects would be      complete without at least some mention of what's perhaps      the bestknown use for an empty ear: the corncob pipe. You      can make your own "Huckleberry Finn smoker" by cutting a      1-1/2" length from the wider end of a cob. Hammer a nail      hole in the side of this section, about 3/8 inch up from      one end, making the opening large enough to accommodate a      small hollow reed or a store-bought pipe stem. Now, use      your pocketknife to hollow out the cob, leaving about a      1/4"-thick wafer intact for the bottom of the bowl. Then      simply insert the reed or stem into the nail hole . . . and      admire your authentic corncob pipe! (If tobacco isn't your      vice, congratulate yourself . . . and let the youngsters      use the finished product for blowing soap bubbles.)    </p>    <p>      There are still other ways to recycle the versatile cobs,      including putting them to work as paint rollers and tool      handles, and you'll likely come up with a few more as you      get accustomed to having the nubby rounds on hand. In fact,      you just might - when planting next season's corn      crop - be as eager to harvest the cobs as you are to      eat the kernels!    </p>
