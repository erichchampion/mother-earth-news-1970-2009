            <p id="isssue">      Issue #206 - October/November 2004    </p>            <p>      <em>Sauté with onions and peppers as savory fillings      for omelets or meat, crisp into crunchy bits for salad      toppings, or stew with barley into nourishing broths.      Anyway you prepare them, mushrooms make delicate morsels,      indeed.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Barbara Pleasant    </h5>    <p>      How people ever figured out that mushrooms could be enjoyed      at the table is amazing considering poisonous species far      outnumber delectable edibles. But they did. Egyptian      hieroglyphics depict mushrooms as food reserved for kings,      and Roman philosopher Seneca called them “voluptuous      poison.” By the Middle Ages, Europeans adopted the      German word, todesstuhl, for “death’s      stool,” to generally refer to mushrooms, all of which      they thought too untrustworthy to eat.    </p>    <p>      But in China, Japan and, later, France, food lovers      revisited that issue when they learned how to cultivate      mushrooms on logs and stumps, and in caves, where cool      temperatures made year-round mushroom production possible.    </p>    <p>      Today, mushrooms figure prominently in most of the      world’s cuisines; in North America, for example, per      capita consumption has steadily grown to almost 4 pounds      per year. Mushrooms such as portobellos, crimini (baby      portobellos) and shiitake have become more available, and      more popular, in recent years, too.    </p>    <p>      Many enjoy raw mushrooms in fresh salads, and cultivated      raw mushrooms won’t hurt you, but it is better      nutritionally to eat them cooked. The cooking process      breaks down a substance in mushroom cell walls called      chitin, and is a necessary step to unlocking the nutrients      and other beneficial compounds. Also, some edible wild      mushrooms contain small amounts of toxins, which may be      reduced or eliminated in cooking, but no amount of cooking      will make a poisonous mushroom safe to eat.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, edible mushrooms are widely available and can      be prepared in many delicious ways, although veteran      mushroom growers often say simplest is best: Just clean,      slice and braise the mushrooms in a hot pan in olive oil      and, sometimes, thinly sliced garlic, with salt and pepper      to taste.    </p>    <p>      There’s magic in this method, too. In the first few      minutes of cooking, mushrooms give off moisture. As this      liquid evaporates, the mushrooms begin to brown slightly,      and with a few more minutes of cooking, they take on the      chewy, savory flavor preferred by connoisseurs. Shiitake      and portobellos have more dry matter (fiber) than the      common white button mushrooms, so they become quite meaty      when braised, and portobellos are a favorite for the grill.      Whether braised in a pan or on the grill, mushrooms cooked      until they are toasty brown make fantastic      “croutons” to add to salads -      <em>provided you can restrain yourself from eating them all      straight from the pan.</em>    </p>    <p>      Of course, you can capture those flavorful juices given off      by mushrooms by using them in stocks or adding them to      soups and stews. To make sure the liquid is mushroom juice      and not just water, never submerge mushrooms when cleaning      them because they take up water too readily. Many cooks      clean them just by wiping the surface with a damp towel or      gently running cool water over the tops. If you opt for the      cool water method, avoid wetting the gills, which are      edible, although they usually are removed from large      portobellos because of their dark- chocolate color. When      preparing portobellos for stuffing or grilling, a      grapefruit spoon makes a great tool for scraping out the      colored gills.    </p>    <p>      Knowledgeable cooks keep a supply of dry mushrooms handy,      as well as fresh ones. Asian markets often offer several      dried varieties, or should you locate a good supply of      fresh shiitake, it’s easy to dry them yourself in a      slow oven. Thoroughly dried mushrooms store well in a cool,      dark place for many months. When you’re ready to use      them, just soak the mushrooms for 15 minutes in hot water;      they will continue to rehydrate as they are cooked.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Any type of mushroom can be used in the following      ways:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>• sautéed with caramelized onions and then      pureed into a pâté<br />      • combined with spinach in quiches or      quesadillas<br />      • braised in oil, then folded into an omelet or      layered onto hot toast<br />      • included in Asian stir-fries.</em>    </p>    <p>      Good flavor ac cents from your garden or spice shelf include      thyme, tarragon, basil, sage, a sprinkling of grated orange      peel or a light spritz of lemon juice.<br />      Mushrooms also go nicely with almost all vegetables, from      asparagus to zucchini, though some of the best pairings      include eggplant, green beans and tomatoes. One of my      favorite concoctions is sautéed onions, garlic,      peppers and mushrooms, with tomatoes added at the end of      the cooking time; this is served over hot polenta and      topped with parmesan cheese.    </p>    <p>      Grains from arborio <em>(risotto)</em> rice to nutty quinoa      pair well with mushrooms, too, and barley seems lost      without them. Recipes for barley pilafs, casseroles, soups      and stews invariably include mushrooms, and we can credit      resourceful Germans for creating delicious mushroom and      barley soup (recipe below).    </p>    <p>      Traditional cream of mushroom soup, a French invention,      also is delectable, and can be lightened substantially by      using half-and-half in place of cream. Should you find      yourself with a bumper supply of turkey stock, try braising      some mushrooms with an equal measure of shallots before      swirling them into the stock and adding a splash of sherry.      Add a plate of crusty bread or a nutty pumpkin muffin, and      dinner is served.    </p>        <h3>      Mushroom and Barley Soup    </h3>    <p>      <strong>This hearty winter soup becomes a satisfying meal      with the addition of whole grain bread or muffins. Serves      4.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons olive oil<br />      8 ounces crimini (baby portobello) mushrooms, stemmed and      sliced<br />      3 ½ ounces shiitake mushrooms,<br />      stemmed and sliced<br />      1 large onion, coarsely chopped<br />      ¾ cup chopped celery (2 stalks)<br />      ½ cup fine barley<br />      4 cups vegetable, chicken or turkey stock or bouillon<br />      1 cup sliced carrots (about 2)<br />      2 cups potatoes, peeled and diced<br />      into ½-inch pieces (2 medium)<br />      ½ teaspoon salt<br />      ¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper<br />      1 teaspoon fresh thyme,<br />      or ½ teaspoon dried<br />      2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</em>    </p>    <p>      In a large cooking pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil      over medium heat. Add half the mushrooms and braise until      nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from      the pan and set them aside. Heat the remaining olive oil,      and sauté the onions until they begin to brown. Add      the celery and barley, and cook another 2 minutes. Add the      remaining ingredients except for the herbs, bring the      mixture to a boil and cook for 20 minutes, or until the      potatoes are tender. Add the thyme and 1 tablespoon      parsley, and cook 5 more minutes. Garnish each bowl with      reserved braised mushrooms and parsley.    </p>
