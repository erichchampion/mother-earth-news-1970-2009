                    <h5 id="byline">      by Winona LaDuke    </h5>    <p>      <em>In the sunny Southwest, many Hopi and Navajo people      have discovered that solar panels strike the right balance      between tradition and technology.</em>    </p>        <p>      The Hopi village of Old Oraibi is believed to be the      longest continuously inhabited village in the United      States. A thousand years of history have shaped the Hopi      culture, with its many stone houses, corn, melons and      ceremonies. On the 1.5 million acres that make up the Hopi      Reservation in northeastern Arizona, 8,000 people live in a      dozen villages high atop the mesas. They follow teachings      about sustainability, and this covenant with Massaw, the      Creator: Live respectfully, acknowledge the Cloud People,      hold your ceremonies, grow your corn, and your people will      see the arrival of the next world.    </p>    <p>      It is from this village of Oraibi that the other Hopi      villages in Arizona sprang - Bacavi, Moenkopi and      Kykotsmovi, to name just three. Here, in the center of Hopi      tradition, one also can find evidence of a people looking      to the future: In Oraibi, and across the reservation, many      homes are now outfitted with solar panels, quietly      generating renewable energy.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>The Solar Business</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      The United States’ fast pace and tendency toward      sudden, dramatic changes is not always a comfortable fit      with the Hopi values of resilience and tenacity, yet it has      not been possible for the Hopi to remain completely      isolated from the rest of American culture. Ironically,      many Hopi live without electricity, even though the      reservation is surrounded by coal mines and power plants.      The Hopi accept change slowly and deliberately, and most      readily when the changes are of their own doing. The Hopi      word potskwaniat means “Hopi pathway to the      future,” and it is a phrase aptly applied to the work      of Native Sun, a Hopi solar power business based in      Kykotsmovi.    </p>    <p>      Native Sun is owned in part by Doran Dalton, a man whose      lifestyle spans both past and future. Dalton is the former      chair of the nonprofit Hopi Foundation, and now runs Native      Sun, a small for-profit business that has employed up to      eight people for big installation projects. With the      support of a group of committed Hopis and friends, more      than 800 household-sized solar units have been installed      for Hopi and other Native American people in the region.    </p>        <p>      “We were all working at the Hopi Guidance Center,      most of us who founded the Hopi Foundation,” Dalton      says, “and we kept seeing the same people.”      They would come in for help, and then be back two years      later, needing assistance again.    </p>    <p>      “We started to talk about what was happening at Hopi.      Most of our people were unemployed, and we wanted to find      some employment for them. And, we wanted to make a      difference here,” he says.    </p>    <p>      Since its founding in 1985, the Hopi Foundation has      restored ancient ceremonial houses, offered language and      cultural classes, developed a health program with the      tribal government and initiated several cottage industries,      including Native Sun and Gentle Rain Designs, a clothing      company that uses recycled fibers.    </p>    <p>      In an unusual move for the isolated Hopi community, the      foundation even reached beyond the borders of the Hopi      Reservation to create a Tucson, Ariz., sanctuary for      indigenous refugees from Central America - an      expression of traditional Hopi teachings of peace.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Culture and Power</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      The Hopi Foundation began in order to stave off an      impending cultural crisis. “Non-Hopi influences      brought onto the reservation were creating problems,”      Dalton recalls. “It was basically Hopi trying to find      themselves - being torn between the Hopi way of      living and the modern way of living, and not being able to      reconcile the two.”    </p>    <p>      Loris Taylor, the foundation’s associate director,      says, “We’ve been taught through Western models      for a long, long time that the answers come from the      outside. When you focus on the deficiencies of people, then      the perception is that the people are weak and that      they’re unable to do things for their own conditions.      Our approach is that the strengths are inherent in      communities.”    </p>    <p>      Many Hopi have resisted electrification of their homes, and      one-third of the villages have not allowed electric power      lines within their boundaries. This has posed an      interesting dilemma. “The Hopi had no objection to      electricity itself,” Dalton says. “It was the      power lines.”    </p>    <p>      Debby Tewa, a Hopi solar electrician who has worked on      Native Sun and other solar projects in the Southwest,      explains: “The traditional Hopis don’t allow      power lines into the villages because the utilities will      have right of way onto Hopi land. Village leaders think      that if we don’t pay the bills, the utilities will      take even more land.”    </p>    <p>      Spiritual issues influence the village leaders, too.      According to the Hopi Foundation, the electromagnetic field      of electricity that emanates from power lines is considered      disruptive to the atmosphere, ambience and balance of      ceremonial areas.    </p>    <p>      The Hopi have tried a number of substitutes for      utility-generated electricity. Most Hopi houses are still      heated with coal, which the people gather from the ground      and the waste piles of the mine site on the reservation.    </p>    <p>      In the past, people also would “hook up to the      battery of their car and hope they didn’t use so much      that it wouldn’t start in the morning,” Dalton      says. Another solution was using generators, but he notes      those had their own complications. “The smell of      exhaust was bad, and we would be yelling (over the roar) at      the dinner table.” The village of Hotevilla, he adds,      was even called “Generator City” at one time.    </p>    <p>      Solar power provided a more appealing option while      maintaining Hopi self-sufficiency. “When you get your      own system, it’s yours,” Tewa says.      “There’s no power line, and no right of way      into the villages.”    </p>    <p>      Native Sun began operations with money from foundation      grants, and a revolving loan program helped community      residents purchase solar panels; today, the loan program is      administered by a local bank.    </p>    <p>      The energy company offers an array of photovoltaic systems:      two, four or eight panels, stationary or rotating. Most of      the options now are in operation somewhere on the      reservation.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>NonProfit Solar</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      Similar issues confront members of the Navajo Nation, whose      reservation surrounds the Hopi Reservation. The Navajo      remain one of the largest populations in the country      without electricity; current estimates are that 10,000 to      25,000 Navajo homes lack grid-based power.    </p>    <p>      But there, too, many people are recognizing the potential      of solar energy and working to fill the growing demand for      solar panels. Native American Photovoltaics (NAPV), a      nonprofit organization that was founded in 1998 by New York      architect Gregory Kiss, has constructed 44 solar systems      for off-grid homes on the Navajo Reservation near the towns      of Winslow and Dilkon. NAPV’s mission is to bring      electricity to people who live in rural areas where utility      companies are unlikely to ever extend their lines.    </p>    <p>      NAPV installs PV panels and offers monthly maintenance      service. The employees also teach conservation and      efficiency. Dave Silversmith, the NAPV project manager,      says, “I teach people how to use electricity from the      solar panels efficiently, what kinds of appliances they can      run and how to conserve electricity.” He also      translates solar terminology into Navajo and explains      concepts that are still new to people there.    </p>    <p>      NAPV also helps clients procure financing for solar panels.      A Department of Energy grant supported the initial project      and early capital costs. Now, the organization is hammering      out new arrangements that will help finance future      projects.    </p>    <p>      Initially, test families signed up for a plan that required      paying $50 per month for 10 years toward the purchase of      their solar-power units (this fee also included repair and      maintenance service). Additional grants that permit smaller      monthly payments for similar projects that support 20 or 30      systems may be awarded.    </p>    <p>      Another possible plan that would finance home PV systems      and fund a solar panel factory on the Navajo Reservation,      where unemployment hovers between 50 and 75 percent, would      require a down payment of $1,000 to $2,000 from each of      20,000 potential Navajo subscribers and 10 years of $150      monthly payments from those with average annual incomes of      at least $6,000.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Solar Future</strong>    </p>        <p>      What the Hopi and Navajo have done is common sense for the      rest of us as well: Use less, produce what you can on your      own, and be cognizant of the implications of each action on      others. This is more than a spiritual and cultural decision      - it is a necessary economic one as well. Imported      fossil fuels are nonrenewable and damaging to the      environment.    </p>    <p>      The push for energy alternatives, self-reliance and      efficiency is growing in communities across the country.      Today, in the era of energy-utility deregulation, many      Native American tribes are considering developing their own      utilities, pooling their consumers to secure lower rates,      and moving towards alternative energy sources. A 1998      handbook called Native Power, produced at the University of      California, Berkeley, has been particularly influential,      showcasing alternative energy projects on various      reservations and in Native Americans’ homes, and      outlining possible energy efficiency and self-reliance      measures for tribes.    </p>    <p>      Back on the mesas of Hopi, solar installer Dalton grabs      some equipment and heads out down the dirt road; Native      American communities of the region are learning from the      Hopi about solar technologies, and Dalton says he hopes      Native Sun has helped customers and potential solar      entrepreneurs to reconnect to a more ecologically and      culturally sustainable way of living. His work at Native      Sun exemplifies the vitality of the Hopi culture and its      strength in today’s world. The people who survived      for a thousand years on the edge of a cliff perhaps have a      few lessons for us all.    </p>    <p>      <em>Winona LaDuke is an enrolled member of the Mississippi      Band of the Anishinaabeg tribe, and she lives on the White      Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. She is program      director of Honor the Earth, a national foundation that      supports environmental initiatives within indigenous      communities. In 1996 and 2000, LaDuke was the Green      Party’s candidate for U.S. vice president, and she is      the author of several books, including All Our      Relations.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Natural Resources on Tribal Lands    </h3>    <p>      Although Native Americans are among the poorest in the      United States, their lands are home to a wealth of natural      resources. Two-thirds of the country’s uranium;      one-third of all Western low-sulfur coal, and vast      hydroelectric, oil and natural gas resources are all on      Native American land. Some of the largest corporations in      the world have access to mine these resources through      leases overseen by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Too      often, Native American communities receive less than the      full value of the resources in royalties, and are left with      huge slag piles, uranium mill tailings and abandoned      uranium mine shafts (more than 1,000 on the Navajo      Reservation alone) when mining operations end.    </p>    <p>      Both the Navajo and Hopi tribes have had disputes with      Peabody Energy’s Black Mesa Coal Mine, which spans      both reservations and employs members of both tribes. The      Navajo Nation took the federal government to court after      the Interior Department accepted a lease rate from Peabody      worth much less than the market value of the coal. Now,      some members of the Hopi tribe are engaged in a battle with      Peabody over the company’s use of reservation water      resources.    </p>    <p>      Peabody employs about 15 Hopis, and provides about $7.7      million in annual royalties to the tribe, a huge chunk of      the budget for a relatively impoverished tribal treasury.      But the company’s coal slurry pipeline to the Mohave      Generating Station, some 250 miles away in Laughlin, Nev.,      annually sucks more than a billion gallons of water from      under the Hopi and Navajo Reservations. The fact that the      Mohave electric plant helps keep the lights bright in Las      Vegas and hair dryers blowing in Los Angeles even as      thousands of people on the Navajo and Hopi Reservations are      without electricity illustrates the unfortunate reality      that energy mined from Native American lands is often not      used for Native American communities.    </p>    <p>      Vernon Masayesva, a past Hopi Tribal chairman and now      director of the grass roots group Black Mesa Trust, says,      “One billion gallons of our ancient, sacred water      evaporates each year in Nevada’s desert skies. One      billion gallons of living water, enough to provide for Hopi      for 100 years, dies on a dry wind.”    </p>    <p>      Today, water levels in some Black Mesa wells have dropped      more than 100 feet, and many of the springs are dry.      Projections are that by the year 2011, the Hopi village of      Moenkopi will be without water. Complex issues are      involved, including the jobs and royalties Peabody Coal      supplies to both the Navajo and the Hopi, but for      Masayesva, the problems with mining and burning coal only      reinforce the need for renewable energy. He advocates      building two large-scale solar power plants to generate      jobs and revenue, one on the Hopi Reservation and one on      the Navajo Reservation. <em>- Winona LaDuke</em>    </p>
