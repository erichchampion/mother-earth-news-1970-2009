        To find out how much insulation your home needs, first find your region on the map and note the Zone number. Then check the chart in the article to see the recommended R-value of insulation for your attic. Also check the next image in this Image Gallery â€” it lists the recommended R-values for walls, crawl spaces, basements and more.
