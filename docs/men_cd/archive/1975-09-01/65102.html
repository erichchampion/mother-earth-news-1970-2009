                    <h5 id="byline">      by CAROL SUHR    </h5>    <p>      Last year, for the first time, I discovered the joy of      drying and grinding my own corn for winter use. This      simple, non-energy-consuming method of preservation was      long practiced by the Indians and in many cases was the key      to their survival during periods of crop failure. Certainly      the practice deserves a revival . . . and what better place      to start than in our own organic gardens? Even the smallest      corn patch is likely to have enough over-mature ears left      on the stalks at the end of the season to warrant a little      experimentation.    </p>    <p>      The fact is, though, that my own discovery of dried corn      came about through sheer laziness. By late summer of last      year-when the last buttery mouthful of kernels had been      chomped off the last tender cob, and I was rapidly growing      weary of freezing corn every day-I was dismayed to      see that many maturing and overripe ears remained on our      garden's cornstalks. What's more, they positively      challenged me to do something with them.<br />    </p>    <p>      Well, I did: I just let them hang there to grow bigger and      fatter and tougher. Then, before the first heavy frost, I      made a last trip up and down the rows and snapped off      enough ears to fill my wheelbarrow. Some were left to feed      the birds and other hungry creatures once the snows fell .      . . and come spring, any scant remains would be tilled back      into the soil to complete the cycle, with nary a grain gone      to waste.    </p>    <p>      The next step was to pull back the husks from my harvest      and spread the ears on clean newspaper in the garage where      they could continue drying out of the weather for a few      more weeks. I then brought the corn into a dry room in the      house, and forgot about it until winter was well      established and life had settled down to a gentler pace.    </p>    <p>      It's my good fortune to have a Thoreau-like father-in-law      who possesses a marvelous hand-cranked corn sheller of a      long forgotten vintage. Thanks to him, I was able to      complete the shelling process in just a few exhilarating      minutes of cranking, clanking, and whirring. The ears were      dropped one by one into the machine's opening, where      spinning wheels quickly separated kernels from cob. The      dried corn pinged into a metal tub, and the stripped ears      came flying out their special hole to fall in a heap on the      floor . . . from which they, were removed to their final      resting place in the kindling box by the Franklin stove.    </p>    <p>      If you should come by the use of such a sheller, the only      necessary precaution-other than keeping your hands      out of the works while the wheels are spinning-is to      be sure your corn is perfectly dry. Otherwise the machine      will jam and you'll have the tedious task of picking      smashed, gummy kernels out of its insides and out of the      bucket. <em>(Hand-cranked corn shellers are available for      $29.95 from Sears and other suppliers, including MOTHERS      General Store, P.O. Box 506, Flat Rock, N.C.      28731.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      In the absence of a sheller, it's not a difficult job to      remove the kernels by hand (provided they're really dry).      You'll find that your thumbs do most of the work, and may      sprout blisters if you're overly zealous in your task.    </p>    <p>      Once shelled, it's a good idea to cover your corn with      cheese-cloth-to keep out dust-and let it dry      further. An occasional stirring every couple of days for a      week or so should dispel moisture and prevent the growth of      a gray, furry mold. (If you live in a damp climate, you may      then want to transfer the kernels to airtight      containers.-MOTHER.)    </p>    <p>      And then for the grinding and eating!    </p>    <p>      To grind your corn you'll need any one of the several types      of gain mills that are on the market. Mine is a      hand-cranked, cast-iron Corona made in Colombia, South      America and available for around $20.00 from MOTHER'S      General Store or Smithfield Implement Company, 99 North      Main, Smithfield, Utah 84321.<br />    </p>    <p>      One cup of kernels yields about 1-1/4 cups of meal, and you      should get a satisfactory consistency in two to three      grindings . . . depending on how you set your mill. A fine      setting will do the job in two passes, but you'll have to      work a lot harder. If you choose a coarser grind to save      your strength, the corn will require an extra trip through      the machine. It's up to you to decide which you can spare      more of . . . time or energy. Since I've already told you      I'm lazy, you won't be surprised to learn that I grind      three times at decreasing levels of coarseness. At least      it's a way to exercise your arm and have something besides      sore muscles to show for the effort!    </p>    <p>      Another labor-saving trick-which also has some      redeeming social value-is to set up the mill for a      day or more in a prominent spot in the kitchen. I find that      no passer-by can resist the urge to toss in a couple of      cups of kernels and try his or her hand at the crank. In      fact, one evening when we had company I wound up with two      quarts of meal without so much as lifting a finger myself.    </p>    <p>      I believe that tasks of this sort have an excellent      potential for bringing people together in meaningful      endeavor. Certainly it's more satisfying for a group to      gather in the kitchen around the miff than for one person      to stand alone, stolidly cranking away. The Indians must      have felt likewise, if we're to believe the history worn      into stone at such places as Coloma, California . . . where      huge boulders with closely spaced grinding holes attest to      the once busy society of women who must have gathered there      to prepare cornmeal and visit together in the autumn sun.    </p>    <p>      However you go about it, you'll be repaid for the work of      grinding your own corn by the knowledge that your homemade      product retains the germ of the grain . . . the source of      flavor, aroma, and natural vitamins and minerals.      Commercial cornmeal-from which the germ is removed in      processing -can be enriched to replace the lost food value      . . . but its makers have found no way to replace the scent      and taste.    </p>    <p>      You'll discover this for yourself when you first smell a      bowl of freshly ground corn and compare it to the sterile      powder in that box you bought at the store. While you're      enjoying the fragrance, though, remember that this delight      is brought to you through the courtesy of the      germ-which is also the home of the corn oil-and      be prepared to store the meal under refrigeration or in a      cool root cellar to prevent the oil from turning rancid.      This is a small price to pay for the benefits of a whole      natural food . . . and anyhow, you'll probably find that      your cornmeal is so good that it won't sit around unused      for long.    </p>    <p>      No doubt you'll want to prepare some favorite dishes with      your homemade product . . . in which case you'll probably      find it necessary to soak the meal at least four hours      before use. Or, if you prefer to try some recipes that are      already adjusted to the characteristics of dried corn, here      are a few to get you started:    </p>    <h3>      DRIED CORNMEAL PANCAKES    </h3>    <p>      1 cup cornmeal<br />      1-3/4 cups milk<br />      2 eggs<br />      1/4 cup cooking oil<br />      1 cup whole wheat flour<br />      2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1 tablespoon brown sugar<br />      1 teaspoon sea salt<br />      1/4 cup dry milk<br />      1/4 cup wheat germ    </p>    <p>      Soak the cornmeal in the milk overnight, and add the eggs      and oil the following morning. Sift together the flour,      baking powder, sugar, and salt, combine the mixture with      the dry milk and wheat germ, and stir in the moist      ingredients. Fry the batter on a greased griddle at      moderate temperature. Don't expect the pancakes to be light      and fluffy! They have substance and flavor and will stay      with you well into lunch hour.    </p>    <h3>      DRIED CORN PUDDING    </h3>    <p>      2 cups rich milk<br />      3/4 cup dried cornmeal<br />      3 eggs<br />      2 tablespoons melted butter, cooled<br />      2 tablespoons chopped green onion<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1/8 teaspoon black pepper<br />      1/8 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      2 teaspoons sugar    </p>    <p>      Heat the milk to scalding, stir in the cornmeal, and let it      soak 4 hours (or overnight, if this is more convenient).      Combine the other ingredients and mix them with the meal      and milk. Pour the batter into a shallow, greased 1-quart      casserole and bake it uncovered at 325° F for 50 to 60      minutes or until the pudding is set in the center.    </p>    <h3>      DRIED CORN TAMALE PIE    </h3>    <p>      3 cups milk<br />      1 cup dried cornmeal<br />      2 cloves garlic<br />      2 medium onions<br />      1 pound ground beef<br />      2 cups frozen kernel corn (or one 16-ounce can)<br />      3 eggs<br />      2 small cans tomato sauce (or 1 small can tomatoes,      drained)<br />      1 small can chopped green chili peppers<br />      2 teaspoons salt<br />      2-1/2 teaspoons chili powder<br />      1 medium can pitted ripe olives, drained    </p>    <p>      Warm the milk, stir in the cornmeal, and let it soak 2 to 3      hours. Brown the garlic, onions, and meat and stir in the      corn, eggs, tomato sauce, chili peppers, and seasonings.      Blend these ingredients well with the cornmeal mixture, and      add the olives. Pour the combination into a large greased      casserole, cover the dish, and bake the tamale pie at      350° F for 1 hour or until it's set.    </p>    <p>      Dried corn has many other uses. It can, for example, be      substituted for up to a third of the flour in any bread      recipe (if you mix the dough by a sponge method which will      give the meal a little time to soak and soften). There's      plenty of scope for experiment . . . and the dishes you      prepare will taste an the better because you grew and      ground the corn yourself.    </p>
