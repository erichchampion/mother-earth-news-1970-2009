                    <h5 id="byline">      by JACK DOWNS    </h5>        <p>      The following directions are for the construction of a      small portable forge . . . a useful tool for the      homesteader and handyman who occasionally needs to heat and      work metal. I made the version described here in      1972-mostly from resources I had on hand-at a total      cost of $2.07 for fireclay, plastic, and small hardware.      Any parts you have to buy these days will be somewhat more      expensive than they were at that time . . . but still very      reasonable. If you do use these plans, I hope you'll feel      free to substitute whatever suitable materials you have      available.    </p>    <h3>      PAIL    </h3>    <p>      The basis of my forge is a 5-gallon metal pail (such      containers are used for the shipment of soap, roofing      cement, and various industrial compounds and are normally      thrown away as scrap by stores and contractors). With tin      snips or a sab er saw, cut away the upper portion of the      bucket, 5 inches from the bottom, around threequarters of      the circumference . . . but leave an upstanding curved      panel 12 inches high to serve as a reflector (see Figs. 1      and 4). Next trim a 1 inch strip from the original top of      the pail and fasten it-rolled edge up-with      sheet metal screws to the rough edge of the forge, to guard      against damage from tools and work pieces. Then fold back      the outer 1/8 inch of the reflector and hammer the metal      down to form a stiff rim.    </p>    <h3>      BELLOWS    </h3>    <p>      Cut two pieces of wood into the shapes shown in Fig. 2. One      of thesethe stationary board-will be attached to the      reflector as shown in Fig. 3. Drill two holes 1 inch in      diameter in the board's upper portion, to serve as air      intake ports. Cover these openings with leather      flaps-on the face of the stationary board which will      be inside the finished bellows-tacked down flat to      act as valves.    </p>    <p>      Turn the same board over, fit a pipe flange to the lower      half of its outer face, and scribe the outline of the metal      collar on the wood. Within this first circle, mark      another-I inch smaller in diameter-and drill a hole      1/2 inch across and off center inside the inner ring.      Tack-a leather flap over the opening to form a check valve,      and mount the flange with screws (over a ring-shaped spacer      of 1/4inch plywood, to prevent interference with the check      valve flap). Then fasten the stationary board to the      reflector with two 1/4-inch bolts and two 1-inch-long pipe      spacers.    </p>    <p>      Provide the movable board with a handle 10" X 1" X 1/2",      attach it with wood screws, and connect the halves of the      bellows at their bottom edges with a pair of hinges secured      with screws from the inside. Cover the edges of the boards      with leather or plastic as shown, taking care to both glue      and tack the material to make a tight air seal. Double-lap      the covering at the bottom and glue it firmly to the      bellows' narrow lower end.    </p>    <h3>      TOOL RING    </h3>    <p>      The tool ring surrounds the pail as shown in Fig. 1 and is      used as a handle for the forge, a holder for tongs, a rest      for work pieces, etc. Form a circle 18 inches in diameter      from 1/4-inch rod, bend the ends flat to match the      stationary board attached to the reflector, and fasten them      in place with sheet metal clips (this helps stabilize the      bellows). Affix the ring to the pail with a brace made from      the bad of the original bucket (see Fig. 4) . . . and add      any extra supports you feel are necessary.    </p>    <h3>      TUYÃˆRE    </h3>    <p>      Drill a hole in the pad in line with the center of the      reflector and directly opposite the lower hole on the      stationary board of the bellows. Cut a piece of pipe long      enough to extend into the center of the container, fit it      with an elbow, and screw this assembly into the flange on      the bellows so that the elbow curves upward. Finally, mix      10 pounds of fireclay and cover the sides and bottom of the      pail to protect the metal from heat . . . <em>but leave the      air outlet exposed.</em> Let the clay dry, and fire up your      forge!    </p>
