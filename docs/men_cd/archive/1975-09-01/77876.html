                    <h5 id="byline">by SANDRA FINAN</h5>    <p>      For over 50 years I've been building and repairing fences.      I started as a young child just big enough to hand my dad      staples and tools . . . and I'm still at it. Most of my      fencing has been done alone, often from scratch, with very      old salvaged posts and wire and I've never found such work      to be difficult. All you need is time and patience, the      information given by Sharon McAllister in MOTHER NO. 33 . .      . and a few additional tips I'd like to pass on.    </p>    <p>      [1] First, about replacement of posts: Often an upright is      broken off near the top, who the bottom is still sound. In      that case a new length of wood can be wired or nailed to      the old, or-if the stub is too short-partly      buried in the ground. You'll frequently see this done on      power or phone lines.    </p>    <p>      [2] I must emphasize that it's very wrong to set a      replacement post into the same hole from which you've      removed a rotten one. Bits of rot will remain in the ground      and will soon start decay in the new wood. It's far better      to dig a clean hole in a spot about a foot to either side      of the original site.    </p>    <p>      [3] To remove a post from a hole (if the upright is long      enough and strong enough to stand this kind of handling),      dig out a good amount of earth three-quarters of the way      around the base and rock the timber back and forth to      loosen it. Then embed the pointed end of a long pick in the      wood near the bottom of the post, rest the tool's head on      solid ground, and pull back on the handle. Or dig out and      rock the upright as described, loop a chain around the      bottom of the post and then around one end of a fulcrum      timber, lay the latter over an upright heavy block, and      push down on the other end. Either method will save your      back and temper.    </p>        <p>      If it's a round iron post you want to uproot, loosen it in      the usual way and then try to rotate it. This often works      like a charm. The same is true of round iron      stakes-usually old axles-which are used to      fasten down tents and buildings or to stake out animals . .      . or which serve as deadmen (anchors for brace wires) at      fence comers and the ends of clotheslines and plant      supports.    </p>    <p>      [4] Deadmen, incidentally, are often simpler to make than      braces and can tighten up a sagging fence or whatever very      quickly and easily. The anchor itself can consist of a huge      rock . . . or you can drive or set a post in the ground at      a sharp angle, pointing away from the end post of the fence      which is to be strengthened. If that arrangement locates      the deadman on a neighbor's property or in a road, simply      install the support a couple of posts up the line.    </p>    <p>      Next, find a length of heavy galvanized wire (either barbed      or plain), run it around the top of the end fencepost,      staple it there, and twist it back on itself. Carry the      strand down around the deadman stake, post, or rock and      back up to the starting point. Puff the wire as taut as      possible with a wrecking bar (as shown in MOTHER NO. 33),      and staple and twist it as before.    </p>    <p>      You now have two parallel strands, which should be twisted      together with the aid of a strong stick (not your wrecking      bar . . . you may not be able to extract it from the grip      of the wire when you're done). The fence will tighten up      just like magic, and the piece of wood can be left in place      and used from time to time to take up any slack that may      develop.    </p>        <p>      [5] Be sure to treat all posts and deadmen against rot.      Used motor oil mixed with creosote makes a good      preservative. Either soak your timbers in a barrel of this      mixture, or apply it with an old paintbrush. Be very      careful not to splash any in your eyes . . . it burns.    </p>    <p>      Creosote is added to this homemade preservative, partly      because animals dislike its odor and taste and will let      treated wood alone. Never soak posts in straight crankcase      oil! Cattle which lick this substance may contract      X-disease from the chemical additives which have been in      use for the last 40 years or so . . . and may even pass on      the condition to their offspring. For the same reason,      never park any vehicle where livestock (or young children)      can get at it.    </p>    <p>      [6] The rounded end of your shovel handle, an old mop or      broomstick, or a wooden closet pole makes a good tool for      tamping sod into a posthole. Anything much larger won't      pack the dirt firmly . . . and don't use an iron crowbar      for such a purpose unless you're young and strong and have      a lot of excess energy to work off. The rest of us find      this technique very tiring.    </p>    <p>      The secret of tamping is to add a very little earth at a      time. The post will then go in so tight that it becomes      part of the ground itself.    </p>    <p>      [7] Posts can be set immobile even in gelatin-soft mud if      you'll simply scrounge a supply of old bricks or rocks and      tamp them in a few at a time all around the upright. To do      this, of course, you'll need a much larger hole than usual.    </p>    <p>      [8] When you drive an iron post, keep water handy and pour      a little at the base now and then to make the job easier.      Stand on the back of your pickup truck to swing a      sledgehammer at the upright, which is held vertically by      your partner or gripped between your knees. <em>(And swing      carefully!-MOTHER)</em>    </p>    <p>      Better yet, have the local welder make you a post-pounder .      . . a length of pipe large enough to fit over whatever      metal supports you're installing (commercial posts, iron      pipe, metal tubing, etc.). The cylinder-which can be      left plain or fitted with two handles-is topped with      a solid iron rod welded into one end. The total weight, of      course, should be suited to your strength.    </p>    <p>      Such a device makes one-person fencing or repairs easy.      Just lay the post on the ground with its bottom end near      the hole, ready to stand up in the proper position. Slide      the pounder over the top, carefully set the whole business      upright, and hammer away by raising the weight and letting      it fall.    </p>        <p>      [9] If you don't have a post- or stake-pounder, a heavy old      axle or straight crowbar is a good substitute. Just hold      the bar upright above the post and bring it down on the      support's top. Such a tool is less tiring and less likely      to miss than a sledge-hammer, and you'll find it easier to      keep the post straight.    </p>    <p>      [10] One trouble with working alone is that there's no one      to tell you whether a post is set straight in its hole.      Here's a simple test: Squat a little to sight the timber      below the level of the pounder (if you're using one). Then      spot a distant utility pole or the vertical edge of a      budding and line up the fence support with that guide.      Perhaps you can find another such marker at right angles to      the line of the first, as a second check.    </p>    <p>      [11] Old barbed wire is often too brittle to be spliced in      the conventional way, but still thorny enough to turn      livestock. In that case, just pull the broken strand as      tight as possible by hand and twine the ends together with      long, gentle twists.    </p>        <p>      [12] When you use a hammer or wrecking bar to stretch wire,      or when you pound in staples, be very careful not to damage      the metal strands. Barbed wire-like glass-is      very strong but also very hard, and breaks easily if it's      slightly nicked or notched.    </p>    <p>      [13] I've stretched many a fence myself by gripping the      barb in the claw of an extra hammer or wrecking bar and      holding the tool's end with my body while I stapled or      twisted the wire. Or you can attach the strand to your      vehicle's trailer hitch-or to a heavy rope or cable      fastened to the front or rear bumper or axle-and      tighten it by moving the truck or whatever . . . but don't      pull it too taut or you'll break even new wire. Or you can      buy inexpensive pulley-and-rope fence stretchers which can      be locked once you've used them to pull a strand as taut as      you want it.    </p>    <p>      A run of new wire should be tight enough to "sing" when      tapped anywhere along its length with a wooden hammer      handle. Old barb, however, may be so weak that it can be      stretched only from post to post.    </p>    <p>      [14] When all broken posts and wire have been repaired, a      barbed wire fence can often best be tightened and made      stock-proof by the addition of extra vertical posts called      "floaters" (since they are not set into the ground). Two      should always be added between regular posts on each new      fence, to prevent livestock from spreading the wires apart.    </p>    <p>      Fasten each floater with staples or galvanized wire so that      it can't slip. You can even hold small ones in place with      the soft, smooth galvanized wire that is sometimes thrown      away in great quantities from vegetable packing sheds. Lace      every floating post down through the horizontal strands of      wire (in front of the first, behind the second, etc.). This      will tighten the fence so that it can't sag, which will      help it last many more years than is normal. If enough      floaters are woven into the strands, you'll have almost a      netting effect.    </p>        <p>      If you don't have a ready source of wooden or iron pipe      floaters, you should know that fencing supply dealers      frequently sell "ready-mades" fabricated from twisted wire.      They're easily installed merely by "twisting them on" to      your horizontal strands of barbed wire (as is often done      along many railroad and highway fences).    </p>    <p>      Whatever kind of floaters you use, you should keep in mind      another strong point in their favor: They make breaks in      the horizontal strands of fencing easier to repair. Often a      replacement piece of barb can be installed with no need for      splices at all: Just run it from one floater to another.      Likewise, a broken main strand on a floater-equipped fence      sometimes doesn't even have to be replaced if its loose      ends are merely bent back around the nearest floater on      each side of the break and securely twisted to the      uprights.    </p>    <p>      [15] Never apply whitewash to a wire fence, or anywhere      near it. The "preservative" causes almost instant rust. For      the same reason, use only galvanized barb and staples.      Contact with ungalvanized metal will start rust even in      good wire.    </p>    <p>      As I said before, building fences and repairing them really      isn't difficult. Just follow a few simple rules and take      the time to do a good job. Even old fencelines, properly      maintained, will serve you well for many years.    </p>
