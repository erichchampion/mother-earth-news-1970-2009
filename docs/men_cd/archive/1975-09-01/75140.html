        <h3>Profit In Cherries.</h3><p>It is claimed that as much as $300 has been made from one acre of cherries. There is probably but little doubt regarding the profit of the cherry tree, but the trouble arises in the labor required in picking. Upon one acre, with the trees 20x2O feet apart, one hundred and eight trees can be set, and it would require only about a bushel from each tree in order to realize $300. Cherry trees do not bear every year alike, and so, perhaps, it is not an easy matter to judge of the average Income from an orchard of an acre. The price realized also depends upon the kind of cherry. We had a tree of a variety known as Siberian or Oxheart, from which a, few years ago an excellent crop of fruit was harvested. I have no means of knowing the number of quarts of fruit gathered, for the reason that many were used for canning purposes-more than a bushel. Many were given away and some were left for neighbors to pick, and besides we sold enough to come to $6. Assuming that as many more were used and given away, there would have been realized from the tree at least $12, and in the same proportion, in an orchard of 108 trees there would be realized almost $1,300. But that was an exceptional year, and yet shows what might be with success, a market and fair prices.</p><p>While a wet soil is objectionable, It Is as necessary that there be a supply of moisture as that there should be a supply of fertilizing material. One of the experiment stations, in referring to experiments and the fact that no results could be traced to the use of fertilizers, says that it was due to the fact that there was not enough water at hand to enable the plants to use the fertility that there was In the soil. The want of sufficient water in mid-summer is-evidently a hindrance to the best effects that might be produced.</p><h3>Small Fowls Make Best Layers.</h3><p>SAMUEL COAD, CONNECTICUT.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">I kept a close record one year of the number of eggs laid by several different pens of fowls. The record was kept from January 1 to March 19. The total number of eggs laid by each pen was as follows: Thirty Plymouth Rock pullets, laid 891 eggs, or equal to 742 for 25 pullets. Twenty-five Leg-horn pullets crossed with Buff Cochins, 790 eggs; 25 Leghorn pullets, 788 eggs; 25 Plymouth Rock hens, 595 eggs; 25 Leghorn hens 586 eggs; 25 black hens crossed with Black Langshans, 482 ,eggs.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">I had 40 black pullets raised from a cross between Black Spanish and Black Langshans. They were fine winter layers. I then bought a Black Langshan cockerel and crossed him with the pullets. Afterward I found out I had made a mistake. The pullets raised from this last cross were large, fine looking birds, but poor layers. The White and Brown Leghorns, full blooded, are good layers all the year round if they have good care. I do not think much of the large breeds for winter layers. It is better to cross them with the smaller breeds, especially with the Brown Leghorn.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><h3><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">BUSINESS NOTICE.</a></h3><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">For the Land's Sake-use Bowker's fertilizers.

Rev. Jackson tied the nuptial knot for the parties, averaging 1,250 pounds on the hoof. The beautiful home of the bride was decorated with one sulky rake' , one feed grinder, and two sets Of work harness, nearly new, and just before the ceremony was pronounced the Mendel & Sons wedding march was rendered by one milch cow, five years old, one Jersey cow, and one sheep, who, carrying a bunch of bridal roses in her hand, was beautiful. She wore one light spring wagon, two crates of apples, three racks of hay and one grindstone of muslin de soie, trimmed with about one hundred bushels of spuds. The bridal couple left yesterday on an extended trip.

True of Cumberland county, Me, who was a member of the state board of agriculture before It was legislated out of existence and has been prominently identified with Maine agriculture for many years. Mr. True has two adjoining farms and is most largely interested in fruit growing and dairying. He keeps about 50 head of cattle, mostly Jerseys and Jersey grades, and ships cream to Portland. The skimmilk is used in raising calves and hogs.<br /></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">But milking twice a day and 365 days each year he considers an "eternal grind," so he is contemplating taking tip the raising of beef cattle. For this purpose, he has recently purchased a Hereford bull and a few females and will try it slowly at first. He has a large out-pasture in which young stock Is raised, but being able to visit it only once or twice a week, he finds that Jerseys become so wild by fall that they do not tame down during the winter. His experience In having several young heifers run wild has been repeated in many instances by other farmers. On these pastures, he thinks that cattle of a quieter disposition, such as Herefords and Shorthorns, would thrive better and be more profitable in the long run, besides saving considerable in labor.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Fruit growing is confined almost exclusively to apples, of which there are about 1000 trees, mostly Baldwins. There is a young orchard of Ben Davis and another of Sutton Beauty. There are some trees about the place of Nod-head and Gravenstein and a few other varieties. Mr True grows about 2 acres potatoes each year and several acres of sweet corn, the ears of which are sold to the cannery and the stalks put in. the silo. He has a large hennery and for many years has kept a big flock of chickens mostly Light Brahmas, but later White Leghorns have been added.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">A large flock of -geese are raised annually.
