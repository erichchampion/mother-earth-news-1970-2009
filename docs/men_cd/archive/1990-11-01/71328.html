                <p>      How to Raise    </p>        <p>      For Fun, profit and maybe even romance    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Jack Hope    </h5>            <p>      <strong>IN APRIL OF</strong> 1959, when I bought my first 1,      000 white spruce seedlings from the New York State      Conservation Department for $7.50 and planted them on      roughly two acres of my parents' small, rocky farm in      upstate New York, I thought I was planting trees simply for      the inherent good of doing so-providing wildlife      habitat, preventing soil erosion, assisting God with      reforestation. So innocent was my upbringing in      Hurleyville, New York, that I had no notion there was such      a thing as the Christmas tree business. For in our town,      whoever wanted a Christmas tree simply wandered into the      woods and cut one. In those days little private land was      posted against trespassing. And neither landowners nor      tree-cutting Christians ever dreamed of offering or      accepting cash money for one of the slim, six-foot balsam      firs or white pines that grew in abundance on the fringes      of every marsh.    </p>    <p>      But a mere decade after my first planting (I subsequently      put in another 5,000 spruces, firs and Scotch pines, my      1959 trees had grown to five and seven and even nine feet      tall and were starting to shade and crowd one another. My      plantation needed thinning. Coincidentally-since by      then I had moved into New York City to take a job-I      discovered that late each November, hundreds of Christmas      tree merchants descended upon the city bearing thousands of      evergreens, parking their tractor-trailers along Broadway      and bribing the appropriate police precinct, all to      street-peddle six-foot Christmas trees to bustling and      eager New Yorkers: Trees just like mine, selling for $10 to      $15 apiece! I realized I was sitting atop a gold mine.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, totally lacking in merchant's genes, my first      marketing pitch amounted only to a timid mention at an      office coffee break that I was driving up to my parents' to      cut my own Christmas tree. Would anyone else "like one"? I      did not dare even mention money. But one gracious soul took      the bait. Toni Gerber, a bright and attractive, newly hired      editorial assistant, announced she would very much like one      of my Scotch pines, although likely something small and      tabletop since she was just setting up her own apartment      and could not afford to pay more than $to. So grateful was      I to have my first paying customer-my only customer      in 1969-that I cut a giant, eight-foot tree and sold      it to Ms. Gerber for a mere $3.    </p>    <p>      Not only that, I married her. Which, like most of my      adventures in the Christmas tree trade, turned out to be a      romantic success but an economic blunder, since I could no      longer charge her for a tree.    </p>    <p>      But from that beginning my marketing skills improved      dramatically, and so did my Christmas tree sales, mostly by      word of mouth. Savvy New Yorkers were eager to buy my      guaranteed-fresh evergreens, off the stump only a day or      two, rather than buy from the large-scale street peddlers,      many of whose trees are cut three weeks or more before      being hauled into the city. Throughout the 1970s my sales      more or less doubled every year up to the point where I      simply had more customers than trees I wanted to sell.    </p>    <p>      So potentially lucrative is the Christmas tree business      that other high-profit rural enterprises-raising      chinchillas, for example, or selling mail-order      shoes-pale by comparison. Consider that, using the      standard evergreen planting configuration (placing      seedlings six feet apart in every direction, roughly 1,100      trees can be grown on a single acre of good ground for a      crop worth, at today's retail prices, somewhere in the      vicinity of $45,000!    </p>    <h3>Selecting a Species</h3>    <p>      <strong>TODAY, AT LEAST 12 SPECIES</strong> of pines,      spruces and firs are sold as Christmas trees in the United      States, ranging from such standards as the balsam fir to      the more exotic and expensive blue spruce. And, with some      significant exceptions, just about any Christmas evergreen      can be grown just about anywhere, from New England to the      West Coast. In general, pines are the most susceptible to      disease and require the most pruning to shape them into      full, salable trees, but once cut, they tend to hold their      needles better than spruces or firs. Spruces shed most      readily, especially in hot, dry living rooms, but are      hardy-growing trees that require little maintenance. Firs      are somewhere in between; their main shortcoming is that      deer like to nibble them.    </p>    <p>      Ask your state department of environmental conservation or      your county agricultural agent to recommend the best      species for your soil and climate. Also, determine which      species you like best. I was once persuaded to plant Scotch      pine since, at the moment, they were said to be the      hottest-selling trees in New York. But after planting I      realized I did not have the passion for this species that I      did for firs and spruces: Their chubby bodies did not fit      my notion of the traditional Christmas tree shape (plus,      they're not a native American species. And, lacking the      passion, I couldn't bring myself to recommend them to my      customers (the only one I ever sold was to Ms. Gerber, nor      to prune them. Thus they grew up gnarled and bent and      crowded together and now occupy an ugly acre behind the      house.    </p>    <h3>Buying and Planting</h3>        <p>      <strong>EVERGREEN SEEDLINGS,</strong> which are two years      old and about eight to to inches tall when you plant them,      are commonly sold in lots of 1,000 (call your state      Christmas tree association for a list of suppliers). But      you can usually get as few as 50o. These days, the      seedlings go for anywhere from $8o per thousand for Scotch      pine to $150 per thousand for blue spruce (by the way, only      about 35% of the blue spruce seedlings you purchase will      ever be truly "blue").    </p>    <p>      If you're like most first-time seedling buyers, you'll be      persuaded the seller has either forgotten or intentionally      lopped off part of your order when you see the amazingly      small bundles into which 1,000 tiny trees can be fit. But      after you've planted your first 50 or too trees using a      mattock-a simple, pick-like hand tool-you'll be      convinced the seller has given you too many. To plant,      slash the mattock's blade six inches into the ground, lever      up a three-sided piece of sod, stick a tree in the hole,      let the sod drop back into place and firm it with your      heel. Take two paces (six feet and repeat the process.      Carry your seedlings-75 or so at a time-in a      10-quart bucket with four inches of water in the bottom to      wet the trees' roots. Plant the trees in more or less      straight lines-but not in perfectly straight lines,      because then your plantation will look perfectly man-made,      non-natural. Working alone you can plant Goo to 1,000      seedlings in a 12-hour day; with a partner you can plant      more than twice as many.    </p>    <p>      There are evergreen growers who use herbicides to kill      competing grass, who even fertilize. Of course, this may      cause pollution and can even harm relatively delicate      species. But I've usually stuck with rugged species, native      to my region, and have planted them in both wet and dry      soils, in open fields, among rocks, in brush, even under      the shadow of mature hardwoods. Yes, my unfertilized,      shaded trees grow far, far slower than those out in open      sunlight; but who, except advocates of the assembly line,      wants all the trees to grow at precisely the same pace?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lazy Pruning</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>UNTIL YOUR SEEDLINGS</strong> have been in the      ground three or four years, do nothing but watch them grow.      Then, when they reach thigh-or waist-height, prune them.      Typically, an evergreen of this height will have a      15-inch-long spire or "leader" on top, which should be      nipped back to eight or 10 inches with clippers or hedge      shears. Also, the tips of each whorl of branches around the      trunk should be trimmed back. What this does-since      you are cutting off all leading or terminal buds-is      divert the tree's hormonal energy away from heavenward      growth and cause it to bush out and become fuller instead.    </p>    <p>      Pruning is done once a year, in June or July: Cutting away      half the year's growth will insure the full conical shape      consumers like to see in their living room. To me, the      Christmas tree industry has done at least an aesthetic      disservice to the public by falsely fattening the world's      evergreens because all the heavy, thickly-branched, crewcut      firs and spruces we see these days in Christmas tree lots      from San Diego to Bar Harbor, Maine, bear no resemblance      whatsoever to the slim and conical contour of most      evergreens growing in the wild.    </p>    <p>      If, as sometimes happens, the needles of a few or a      fieldful of ready-to-harvest trees turn pale green or      yellow, growers may spray chemical compounds on the trees      in late summer to hide the defect and "restore" the natural      dark-green color. "Consumers demand a lush, green tree,"      says Jeanne Weiss, assistant director of public relations      for the National Christmas Tree Association. "So some      growers resort to a latex-based tint that also inhibits      moisture loss." However, this practice is less common than      in previous years, because poorly colored trees are simply      harvested and replaced with more appropriate species.    </p>    <p>      Another issue for Christmas tree growers is the      clear-cutting of all marketable trees. Since trees grow      unevenly, one practice is to cut taller, grown trees to be      replaced with seedlings-but growers have been known to      clearcut an entire year's crop. A far better practice,      perhaps, is to permit a certain proportion of your trees to      mature and grow forever.    </p>    <h3>Selling</h3>        <p>      <strong>YOU WILL KNOW</strong> that your trees have reached      acceptable market dimensions and appearance once your      neighbors start stealing them, driving their trucks and      off-road vehicles right up on your premises and leaving you      with an empty stump. There are several fun ways of      discouraging theft. But the absolutely best way is to sell      your current year's crop of Christmas trees before the      thieves get to them.    </p>    <p>      There are four ways to sell. You can sell to a broker who      will then resell them at retail. You are spared all      marketing worries and have cash in hand. But the cash you      have in hand will only be about one-third of the trees'      full value.    </p>    <p>      Or you can cut as many trees as you think you can      sell-say, 500-load them onto a truck and cart      them to a local shopping center or the nearest big city and      sell them yourself. This way, though, you are imprisoned in      the role of street peddler, shuffling about in the cold on      concrete for a solid month before Christmas, constantly      rebundling your trees on display and haggling all day with      people who may not know a Douglas fir from a tamarack. For      earning potential, this is the riskiest proposition.    </p>    <p>      I've used two methods to sell. One is to have customers      come to my place in summer, tag the tree they want (and pay      then and return in December to cut it themselves and cart      it away. It's an outing, and it's immensely popular among      urbanites, who will drive vast distances to do this. I take      rather fondly to these customers because they are willing      to walk at least a few feet into the woods and employ a saw      or an ax.    </p>    <p>      But, even today, my main method of selling evergreens, one      I seem to have fallen into over the years after my first      sale to Ms. Gerber, is an urban, custom-order Christmas      tree business. People, mostly friends and neighbors, phone      us in late November, describe exactly what size and shape      tree they want, then trust my judgment to bring back just      what they've ordered, for an agreed-upon price. Since he's      fallen off his diet again and gained 40 pounds, Alan Cohen      informs me, he wants a fat tree this year, fatter than he      is. And, as always, Judy Prince wants an eight-footer,      noticeably taller than she, at six-feet-two.    </p>    <p>      I then go upstate, wander neurotically about the place for      hours deciding which is the best tree for Rolly, for Toni      and me, for Elaine and Pablo, before making a single slice      with my handsaw. I finally cut and haul the trees back to      the house-usually alone, sometimes with my mother's      help-bundle them up and drive them back to the city.      There, I store them in the cold courtyard of our building,      give them something to drink and wait for my repeat      customers to come pick them up.    </p>    <p>      This is an absurd way of doing business. Dragging and      carrying the 40-pound trees back to the house is hard work.      If there's been an ice storm I have to thaw out the      evergreens in the house before bundling them, which      invariably floods the kitchen. And since I insist on tying      the individual trees with cord (instead of using the      popular but ecologically unfriendly plastic tree bags, by      the time fm through my hands and forearms have more pricks      from sharp needles than a heroin addict's. For years I      rented a truck or van for transport but lately I've been      borrowing my mother-in-law Miriam's Oldsmobile or our      friend Estelle's Chevrolet. This automatically limits the      number of orders I can take to the number of five- to      12-foot trees that can be crammed into and tied atop a      passenger car (19 for the Olds, 16 for the Chevy). Drivers      stare at me as my mass of greenery crawls along the      highway.    </p>    <p>      And I love it. First, because I get the chance to wander      our 25 acres and visit the trees I've planted over the      years, including some, I'm proud to say, that are now      lovely, stately creatures-60 feet tall with trunks 18      inches thick. Furthermore, when I arrive in the lobby of      our apartment building with my load of wonderful,      fine-smelling trees-wearing my tattered logger's shirt,      bucksaw in hand and a stubble of beard on my face, my hands      a mass of lacerations-I create a sensation. People ask      where I got the trees. They ask if I have any leftovers and      if they can buy one next year. And they wonder-I like      to believe-if this is the same mild-mannered fellow      who, the rest of the year, merely pecks away at a      typewriter. I am Woodsman-For-A-Day.    </p>    <p>      Finally, by selling to the same faithful year after year,      all of whom know I see my trees as offspring, I even get to      share a bit in the spirit of their Christmases. Often fm      invited over to share hot cider and see my "children" all      decked out in their holiday finery.    </p>    <p>      This is how I conduct my Christmas tree business. If you      follow my methods, you will likely not realize your peak      earning potential. But you will still have a very merry      Christmas:    </p>
