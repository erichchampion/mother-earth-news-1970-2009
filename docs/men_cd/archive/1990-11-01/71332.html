                    <p>      Three ways to build one    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      BY jeff Taylor    </h5>            <p>      <strong>O</strong>f all the exquisite moments that pass      unnoticed in daily life, coming home to your own front door      is the second best. Behind you, a day's work and hard      knocks in the smelly, stony world; ahead, a portal leading      to warmth, soft sounds, familiar smells, slippers and a      gathering of spouse, children and/or pets into your arms.    </p>    <p>      The very best moment? Closing that door behind you, hearing      the blessed latch bolt slide along the striker plate and      click into its mortise. Psychologically, you're home at      last only when you have a solid door between you and the      outside world.    </p>    <p>      If you've never built a door before, perhaps you've been      intimidated by one word: rustic. Contaminated by the      science of real estate, its close synonyms are shoddy and      ugly, which is regrettable, because a useful handmade door      can be owner-built strong and sturdy, using one of three      classic patterns: batten, layered or joined. All are well      within the range of average skills and abilities, and can      be as beautiful as any panel door without being as      difficult to make. If you have an odd-sized opening, you      can make a custom-fit door for less money than a mill      charges. You'll need only a flat, wide workbench and fairly      unremarkable tools.    </p>    <p>      Another nice feature of handmade doors is that you can      build them slightly larger than their intended openings,      and plane them to a perfect fit. In fact, you should. And      after they're mounted in place, you can easily take them      off the hinges to slather every square inch-top,      bottom and sides-with paint or spar varnish. In fact,      you must. Water intrusion is the number one killer of      doors; don't let it murder yours.    </p>    <p>      Another caveat: Acquire the intended lockset before you      build any handmade door. Some of these doors are thicker      than the standard width of just under 2", and may need      special hardware or modifications to the latch-bolt area.      For a barn or outbuilding that doesn't need to be      burglarproof, you can invent a latch of your own design;      but a house or garage door should have key locks. When      you're ready to install the lockset, use a holesaw to cut      the lock hole, a drill to make the latch-bolt hole, and a      sharp chisel to flush-mortise the latch bolt.    </p>    <p>      Installation of any door goes a lot easier if you mount the      hinges on the door first, rather than on the jamb. Hinges      usually go 8" from the door's top, 9" from the bottom, and      at the exact midpoint. Set the door in place with blocks      underneath, to raise it to a proper top reveal (spacing of      t/8"; a steel flatbar works admirably to jockey it around      and avoid finger-pinching.    </p>    <p>      In most cases you'll need three heavy-duty loose-pin butt      hinges. Mark the placement of hinges on the jamb, and take      out the hinge piers, Now you can install half the hinge on      the jamb, and slip the door into place. Bang the pins back      in, and perform fine-tuning with a plane. The door should      swing easily without binding, be square to the jamb and      meet all jamb stops evenly.    </p>    <p>      Don't forget, these will be heavy, rock-solid doors built      lovingly with labor and sweat; you won't want them (or you      to get dinged or damaged. Have a husky helper at hand.    </p>    <p>      And what will you have built? "Just" a door? A friend of      mine recalls a door, handmade a century ago, on which he      remembers a flurry of incremental lines in pencil, tracing      the growth of a hundred years' worth of one family's      children. It bore nail marks from wreaths of Christmases      past and the scratches of dogs who once chased horses in      the street. And long ago it closed every night behind      Father, home from a rough day at the Industrial Revolution.    </p>    <p>      Just a handmade door indeed.    </p>    <h3>      The Batten Door    </h3>        <p>      THE BATTEN DESIGN on page 29 is most often found on barn      doors-one row of parallel boards held together by      perpendicular and diagonal battens. By choosing tongue and      groove or shiplap, these can be built quite weathertight.      Where batten-door builders err most often is by using      adhesives for additional strength: If the edge joints are      glued, the boards will expand and contract at different      rates than the battens, and the door soon warps to the      point of skewed rusticity.    </p>    <p>      Another pitfall is fastener length: Make sure your nails      and screws are just long enough to go through board and      batten without projecting. The polite nomenclature for what      happens if you don't is ruined, with obscene variations.    </p>    <p>      Cut pine or cedar boards to fill the opening as measured      side to side, ripping them into equal widths so you don't      have a thin oddball on the edge. Assemble the boards,      leaving them slightly longer than the finished height of      the doorway. With a framing square and pencil, lay out the      exact vertical measurements of the finished door, and nail      or screw the horizontal battens securely to each board.      Nail or screw on the vertical battens. Trim the excess at      top and bottom, and check for square again.    </p>    <p>      Now you're ready to apply the diagonal braces. The first      brace will be contiguous, from one comer to the other. The      second one is cut to fit closely. When done, carefully turn      the door over and nail into the battens, two or three nails      per; it's wise to draw faint pencil lines to keep the nail      or screw heads pleasingly straight.    </p>    <p>      For optional strength, you can duplicate the batten pattern      on the blank side. Remember, however, that this will add to      the finished weight; are your hinges large enough to carry      it? Check the dimensions one final time, bevel all outer      edges slightly, and hang the door. If you've built double      doors, affix an astragal on the one you'll be closing last,      to seal off the meeting point    </p>    <h3>      The Layered Door    </h3>        <p>      A LAYERED DOOR (see drawing above, with three full      thicknesses of wood, is much stronger than a batten door,      but it's also heavier. Advantages include incredible      rigidity and resistance to warping, and the ability to      incorporate artistic flourishes such as diagonal outer      layers. Unlike a batten door, a layered door can have a      window.    </p>    <p>      However, this door will not only be heavier than a cow, it      will also be thicker than standard. And unless you make      other arrangements, the plywood end-grain will show on the      edges, uglifying it. You'll either have to extend the outer      layers beyond the core and employ a fillet, or place a      covering band around the entire perimeter. With such a      band, all three layers of the rough door must measure 3/4"      smaller in height and width than the finished opening.    </p>    <p>      Cut the plywood to fit the opening, minus the 3/4" (or      fillet width, and apply the first outer layer of boards.      Here you can use glue, preferably waterproof construction      adhesive in tubes. And you won't have to worry so much      about nail length; in fact, you want the nail points to      come through about half an inch, because you'll clinch them      over. When you affix the exterior layer to the other side,      the nail points won't project. If you don't want any nails      to show, blind-nail them: Drive the nails at an angle into      the tongue and countersink slightly. The groove of the next      board will hide the nails. Glue and clamp the fillets into      place; or nail on a covering band.    </p>    <p>      After the glue has set, mark out a window opening if      desired. Install it, and you're ready to hang this door.    </p>    <h3>      The Joined Door    </h3>    <p>      WHEN PROPERLY BUILT, a joined door (see drawing above      constructed of 2" nominal-size lumber fastened internally      by threaded rods looks the least homemade. It's      particularly suited to openings in stone or concrete, the      kind you find in a castle or dungeon. But this type      requires more advanced tools and skills; unless you're a      genius with a plane and hand drill, you'll need a joiner to      dress the edges and a drill press to bore the holes through      which the threaded rods will pass. You'll also need four      bar clamps.    </p>    <p>      Lay the boards side by side, and mark out the rough door      with a framing square (leave it a little wide; joining and      clamping will reduce the width. Draw four faint pencil      marks across the face, equidistantly spaced (see drawing,      to locate the bore holes. Next, tun each board through the      joiner to dress both edges.    </p>    <p>      Now for the fun part. Drill countersunk holes in the outer      boards only, to hide the nuts and washers; and then run      each board through the drill press to make the axis holes.      You can make the holes a little larger than the diameter of      the 1/2" threaded rods, but take care to place them exactly      in line with the pencil marks.    </p>    <p>      Glue time. Use either construction adhesive in tubes to      place a thin line of glue down the center of each edge, or      a brush to paint both edges with slow-setting wood glue.      Use the bar clamps to clamp the boards together, but not so      tight that the door cups.    </p>    <p>      Now run the threaded rods down their channels and snug them      up, ever so gently, top and bottom rods first. Don't torque      any single nut to maximum; alternate from nut to nut,      taking out the slack as you go and wiping excess glue as it      squeezes out of the cracks. Glue in wood plugs. Allow all      glue to set overnight.    </p>    <p>      In the morning, your door will be ready for final trimming,      edge beveling and sanding to remove any glue that remains.      After that, you're ready to hinge and hang.    </p>
