                <p>      <strong>Home Mechanic</strong>    </p>        <p>      Hints and secrets that will keep your country car or truck      in your driveway and out of the mechanic's.    </p>        		<p><em>      Not too long ago, the drivetrains of most vehicles were      laid out with a fore-and-aft engine, leading to a      transmission which led to a driveshaft that ran under the      chassis and back to a differential, powering the rear      drive wheels. On top, the engine had a carburetor and big      air-cleaner that sucked fuel down into the engine, thick      ignition wires that carried a crude ignition spark from a      mechanical distributor to spark plugs, a brake cylinder on      the fire wall, a battery and radiator up front with maybe      an air conditioner off to one side. Oil dipstick, radiator      cap, and transmission fluid checking stick or port were all      located in the same places.</em></p><p><em>      In today's downsized vehicles, the engine is liable to be      arranged sidewise over a front-wheel-drive transaxle that      combines transmission and wheel-drive in a single unit      (saving many pounds of driveshaft and gearing). The      up-jutting carburetor is gone, replaced by a featureless      black box containing a fuel injection unit capable of      better performance and greater fuel efficiency than a      "carb." The battery is still recognizable, but the air      cleaner may be tucked over beside the wheel well. Dipsticks      and fluid-fillers may be located in unexpected spots, and      all of it is covered with a maze of wires and tubes that      can be different in each model for each year.</em></p>		<h3>	      <em>The Typical Layout</em>    </h3>    <p>      <em>Follow the illustrations, and we'll walk through the      operation of a modern engine, indicating routine      maintenance work you can perform. (Much of this work is      overlooked on modern vehicles that don't need a      tune-up-or what remains of this once frequent      job-till they pass 100,000 miles.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>As fuel is pumped into the gas tank, air carrying      evaporated fuel is displaced-in the old days, venting      into the atmosphere and generating up to 20% of air      pollution. In modern systems, fuel is filtered out by a      charcoal canister and returned to the engine to be burned.      Like all emissions-control equipment this system cannot be      removed legally and must be maintained in operating      condition (though many are useless from neglect). It has no      adverse affect on engine performance; indeed, it decreases      fuel consumption and cost, so it pays to keep it in shape.      If the canister is dripping gasoline or is fractured, you      can replace the internal disposable filter, inoperative      purge valves, and malfunctioning or fractured housing very      easily. Parts are readily available and the manuals show      how to test the system and repair the components.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Pushed into a rubber grommet in the valve cover atop      the engine is the PCV (positive crankcase ventilation)      valve (see illustration on next page) that permits oil and      exhaust-fume-contaminated air inside the engine to be drawn      into the air cleaner housing, where it is pulled into the      cylinders to be burned and its by-products disposed of via      the exhaust system.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Here is the air cleaner housing (see illustration on      next page). It contains a disposable filter that removes      dust and bugs from engine air. If the filter element clogs      or is installed so that the gasket between housing and its      lid is not seated well all around, it will admit dust that      acts like sandpaper and can ruin an engine in short order.      At one side of the filter housing is the smaller PCV filter      that removes oil particles from the contaminated air being      drawn from the engine's crankcase. It gets soiled and is      stained an oily brown with normal use. Don't let it clog,      or PCV function will be in paired. Check monthly, and      change both air and crankcase-air filters any time they      appear discolored. Change the air filter as often as weekly      if your area is very dusty-if you drive often on dry,      unpaved country roads. When you change the filters, use a      cloth to clean out the inside of the air cleaner housing as      well.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The intake-air preheater is a metal tube that carries      air warmed by the exhaust manifold to the carburetor during      cold starts. This quickens both starting and warm-up by      heating incoming air so combustion is cleaner and more      efficient. The 2"- or 3"-diameter metal tubing is often      flimsy and easily dislodged. The small rubber vacuum hose      that operates a flapper valve in the air-intake can come      loose as well. An occasional check to assure that the      system is firmly in place can save you gas money and keep      the air cleaner.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>There are other components of the system that you can      maintain using your manuals. Some vehicles have      bimetal-coil heat-risers at the base of the system that      will rust out in time. Wiring to the electric heaters and      electronic controls in newer systems can come loose, fray,      or break. You will never know the system is broken till the      engine won't start and keep running on a cold morning.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The computer of a modem engine management uses      information from a dozen or more sensors to send operating      signals to actuators inside the cooling, fuel-intake, and      exhaust systems and in the engine itself. The computer      program and its operation should be automatic, seamless,      and transparent to the driver. However, sensors and      actuators are exposed to engine heat and dirt, and not all      made to last as long as they should. More problems are      caused by faulty computerinput/output devices than by      serious engine malfunction-but failing to replace the      inexpensive little parts can result in serious engine      damage.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The problem that made your CHECK ENGINE light fire off      or that's causing it to misfire, hesitate, or stall can      often be fixed by assuring that all vacuum hoses (for the      many emissions-system devices operated by exhaust suction)      and electrical fittings are firmly attached.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>With a basic knowledge of the engine and experience (or      a man's hunch or women's intuition-often the best      diagnostic device) or with a simple hand-held code reader      and a diagnostic manual, you can often locate a faulty      sensor or activator. Even if you can't cure the problem,      you can pinpoint the source for a mechanic, saving him      learning time and saving you repair costs.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Following are the major components of the engine      management system. Most are small and may be located      anywhere on the auto. They are interconnected by vacuum      tubing or wires-all of which must remain sound.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The computer itself can be located inside the cab under      the seats, under the dash, or (as here) on an exterior fire      wall. There isn't much that you or I can do but make sure      it is firmly fixed in place and that all wires are firmly      attached.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>MAP (manifold absolute pressure) is the vacuum caused      by air-fuel mix entering the engine. The sensor that reads      its value is connected to a hose leading into the intake      manifold; breaks in the hose are a common problem source      that you can identify and fix easily.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>MAF (mass air flow) and VAF (vane air flow) sensors      gauge the air flowing into the engine. The MAF type are      all-electrical. But a VAF contains a mechanical flapper      valve that can corrode and break or become fouled. If you      have the latter, assure that it works freely. Removing the      vent and squirting with carb cleaner periodically will      prevent jams.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Air and water temp sensors are solid-state devices with      electrical wires that can work loose or break. If a code      readout indicates problems, the manual will give test      parameters. Replacement is easy (if you can find the      infernal things).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>This applies as well to the oxygen sensor in the      exhaust manifold and to sensors for the EGR valve, vehicle      speed, air control valves, and more little gadgets located      all over the vehicle. You can avoid the most common      problems by getting a repair manual, locating each device,      determining how it should look when new, and checking it      periodically to replace vacuum hoses or electrical      connectors that have come loose. Or, replace it      preemptively to avoid problems.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In the future, when replacing wearing parts (installing      a rebuilt carburetor, for example), plan to replace the      attendant electronic gadgetry as well (on the carb, install      a new throttle-position sensor and any fuel or airflow      measuring devices). The manual will show how-but      won't tell you when.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Fuel-intake systems incorporate filters with elements      that should be replaced periodically. Especially with      easilyclogged fuel-injection systems, this job should be      done by a qualified mechanic. Indeed, some manuals      recommend that the final filter never be removed and rely      on a prefilter located nearer the tank in the fuel line.      You can avoid most contaminated-fuel problems by buying      fuel from reliable brand name stations from pumps with      water separators/filters and by assuring that the nozzle      and area around the filler pipe is clean before you gas up.      If a section of rubber fuel line is accessible under the      hood, you can insert a small replaceable in-line filter as      well. Be sure to replace it periodically.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Carburetors (if your vehicle still has one) have      externally-mounted automatic chokes, base heaters, and      other devices for easy and automatic starting. Automatic      chokes are operated by suction or electricity, and the      vacuum tubes or wires can work loose. Or, the actuators      wear out in time. Indeed, the infamous "choke pull-off" is      still a common cause of hard starting. It is easily      replaced but should be done by an experienced mechanic      unless you are a dedicated auto DIY'er with a full      mechanic's tool set. Ditto for carb adjustments (if any are      possible) as well as an eventual rebuild or      replacement.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Jets on fuel-injection systems need replacing      periodically, as do the pump and plumbing. This definitely      should be left to the pros.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Modern engines eliminate NOx, an Ozone contributor,      from emissions by injecting a small amount of low-oxygen      exhaust gas into the fresh fuel charge. The EGR      (exhaust-gas recirculation) system that does this is      all-metal, robust, and complex, and it is best left to a      pro.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The air-injection system is the reverse of the EGR      system. It doses exhaust gasses with fresh air so      pollutants will have oxygen to burn to harmless gas and      water inside the catalytic converter. Active air injection      systems do this with an alternatorsized "smog pump" running      off the engine belts. Passive EGR systems harness changes      in exhaust pressure to do the pumping. Malfunctions do      little to influence engine performance or appearance of the      exhaust, but will turn up at an exhaust-gasses test. All of      them feature hoses and simple valves that can be tested and      replaced by a pro.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Contrary to popular opinion, a smog pump takes no more      engine power than an idler pulley. The air-injection system      is often neglected (or illegally removed) in states that do      not require an annual smog test. For the atmosphere's sake,      leave yours in place and have it tested periodically.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Under the auto, installed in front of the muffler in      the exhaust system is the catalytic converter. It heats up      to 1,600°F and converts pollutants into harmless gasses      and water. It may be fitted with an air inlet from the smog      pump and one or more sensors. It is normally foolproof and      will last 100,000 miles. But if you have a poorly adjusted      engine (running rich), the element inside can melt and      reduce exhaust flow, severely reducing performance. An      experienced mechanic can spot a clogged converter by      feeling the vehicle's exhaust. So can you ...if you know      what it should be.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So, learn all you can about how the machine operates,      how it looks, feels, and smells when new. Then, you'll be      able to diagnose many problems and fix as many as you care      to tool up for.</em>    </p>		    <p>      Some auto components degrade with time, others with wear,      others from weather, others from poor care, and some from      combinations of the four. The condition of many has an      effect on the vehicle's emissions, fuel economy, and      contribution to the landfill as well. If you take a little      time to learn what parts are affected by which hazard, how      to minimize the damage, and when to replace key parts      before they fail, your pocketbook-and the      environment-will benefit.    </p>    <h3>Home Study and First Steps</h3>    <p>      Though it goes against the do-it-yourself inclination of      Americans, as soon as you get the new hauler home, take the      owner's manual out of the glove box and read it through. If      you intend to work on the vehicle yourself, also obtain a      copy-current for your vehicle's model and      year-of the Chilton, Haynes, or other allinclusive      repair manual. They are available for under $30 at a book      or auto parts store. At the same time, get a container of      hard axle grease, several spray cans of light engine oil, a      jar of white door-hinge lube, a tube of powdered-graphite      lock lube, and a quart of good hard auto wax or one of the      new fluid non-wax car polish.    </p>    <p>      Open all the doors, pop the gas-filler-door, lift      rear-hatch covers, and see how things operate. Try      everything that moves, cinch gas cap on tight, and fasten      any loose items in the hatch area so they are stable and      rattle-free. As you go, apply hard grease to spring hinges,      white grease inside and all over door latches and over seat      slides, plus a good shot of powdered graphite into locks.      Inside such hidden spaces as the gas lid and well behind      the fender, apply a thin but thorough coating of spray-oil.      Let it drip and, in hidden crannies, let it accumulate road      dust that will help the oil skin over and hold fast. These      simple measures will stop corrosion before it can start.    </p>    <h3>The Interior</h3>    <p>      Go over the inside as well. With small amounts of grease      and an oily rag, coat any hinges and metal surfaces that      won't soil your clothing-up under the dash, inside      ash trays or metal glove box doors.    </p>    <p>      Make a note to order a set of aftermarket doorsill covers      and install them after greasing their undersurfaces as well      as the metal sill itself. In ten years, the sill will be      strong and pristine rather than rusted.    </p>    <p>      The best wear-preventative measure is to buy good-quality      floor mats and seat covers and to change them for new when      they wear.    </p>    <p>      A bed liner can protect the bottom and sides of a truck      bed. But, it can also rub, wearing off paint, hiding rust,      and voiding your warranty. Read the owner's manual and      install only an approved liner.    </p>    <h3>Under The Hood</h3>    <p>      Now, raise the hood and familiarize yourself with the      engine and accessories. Identify and check inspection ports      and dipsticks for coolant, engine oil, transmission, brake,      power-steering, windshield-washer, and any other fluids.      Read the owner's manual as you go. You'll note that the      engine must be off to check oil; it must be running to      check automatic transmissions. Batteries and air      conditioning contain fluids but are sealed systems.    </p>    <p>      Following our introductory illustration and your manuals,      try to locate key emissions equipment. While the engine is      still clean, remove, inspect, and re-install easily-removed      filters. Wiggle air-intake and other hoses. If anything      comes off, reattach it and tighten the compression clamp.      Inspect rubber hoses for solid attachment at both ends.    </p>    <p>      Nothing under the hood (except battery terminals and bare      metal of the underside of the hood, its hinges, and      latches) should need greasing or preserving. Oil hood      metal, and remove and coat battery terminals and the lead      cable clamps with hard grease. DO NOT wipe some      late-night-TV-hawked preparation all over your belts,      hoses, and fittings. The best of these are worthless, and      some will melt plastics and make rubber gummy.    </p>    <p>      If a fan belt squeaks, you can dress it with Ivory soap.    </p>    <h3>Underneath</h3>    <p>      A good country hauler will have ground clearance sufficient      for you to "get out and get under" as the old song says. Be      sure the emergency brake is set and wedge good stop-blocks      on the downhill side of the two uphill wheels. Lay out a      ground sheet or flattened shipping carton if the driveway      is wet or rocky and slide around beneath the machine.      Locate major drivetrain components, drain plugs, exhaust      system, and brake system parts. While you're there, check      for leaks. If you spot any fluid on the chassis or on the      ground underneath, note its color and texture (antifreeze      is green; brake and transmission fluids, red; oils, clear      or tan), and tell the dealer. Such leaks are rare in      today's new vehicles, but the sooner one is fixed, the      better.    </p>        <p>      Thoroughly oil-spray the undersides of the wheel wells and      all body metal you can reach. Do not coat rubber or plastic      parts (a coat of car polish can protect hard plastic).    </p>    <p>      Grease exposed (brake system) springs and spray oil over      all exposed metal surfaces of the underside of the vehicle,      painted or not. Put a ground cloth or absorbent litter      under the vehicle to catch drips.    </p>    <p>      Put a light coat of hard grease over steel drive shafts,      iron housings-but not on aluminum or other pot metal.      Spray especially well into body cavities such as the      channels under those doorsill protectors.    </p>    <p>      Put the little red plastic tube on your spray can and spray      through the drip holes at the bottom of doors and hatches      so it coats inner surfaces of the tin. Next day (and      periodically thereafter) run a wire into the drip holes to      assure that they are not clogged and will let      rust-promoting condensation and rain water flow out.      Drilling holes in the door and spraying all the      window-closing mechanisms, as is still needed on older      vehicles, is not necessary with modern corrosion-proofing      (where the entire body, door shells, and other major parts      are dipped in hot zinc galvanize and other      preservative-fluid baths). With the inside of the bottom      panel oiled occasionally, the door will last indefinitely.      (In time rubber gaskets around windows may begin to leak      and will need replacing. But that's decades away.)    </p>    <p>      Then go over the vehicle, performing more Preventive      Maintenance (PM) chores that will save you headaches in      years to come. Locate and remove the spare. Wipe a light      coating of light oil over the wheel and liberally coat      attachment screws and nuts with hard grease so they'll come      off easily even if not removed for the first time till ten      years hence. In storing the spare, be sure tire valve is      exposed so you can check inflation from time to time. If      the wheel is exposed to road grime beneath or on the rear,      invest in a good tire cover and install it. Put cover on      top of under-chassis tires so tar and road crud won't      accumulate in the wheel and turn to hard-to-remove concrete      over time. Coat all sides of hold-on components with a      light coat of hard grease.    </p>    <p>      If you plan to perform major maintenance jobs yourself, go      to an auto parts store and get the largest hydraulic jack      you can afford (ten-ton), a long 3/4"-drive handle, and      sockets to fit the lug nuts that hold your wheels on. (A      compressor and air tools are even better, but expensive,      for when you have the need to do a lot of heavy work.)    </p>    <p>      Put anti-roll wedges under two wheels (as well as jack      stands; call us worrywarts, but the physical injury      possibilities here are ...well...use your imagination).      Consult the manual for jack placement, and use the jack to      raise the axles so one wheel after another is just off the      ground. If you want to get under the vehicle, place large      logs or concrete (for lighter cars only, stands for heavier      models) under the frame so if the jack fails, the vehicle      will be supported by blocks.    </p>    <p>      Then remove wheels one at a time. Lightly oil insides of      wheels and grease the hub around the studs. Grease any      suspension parts you didn't get from underneath. Don't      lubricate the large round brake discs or other wheel/brake      parts.    </p>    <p>      Pack hard grease into threads of lugs (big screws jutting      from the end of the axle that hold wheels on) and lug nuts,      and replace wheels. See owner's manual for tightening      sequence for lug nuts. If you have a torque wrench, tighten      to 80 lbs. (Any time you have wheels or tires serviced,      demand that lugs be tightened to no more than 80 lbs or you      may not be able to remove a flat.)    </p>    <p>      Add the 3/4""-drive, lug-nut-removing tools to your jack      set or carry them along with the larger jack under a seat      for much easier flat repair.    </p>    <p>      Make it a habit to check inflation of your tires (spare      included) at least once a month. Buy and use a good-quality      all-metal tire gauge, not the chronically inaccurate dials      on service station air pumps. Inflate to the precise      pressure molded into the sidewall of the tire.      Overinflation may improve gas mileage marginally but will      cause uneven wear that can ruin a tire in a fraction of its      designed (up to 80,000-mile) service life. Intentional      underinflation is OK to increase traction briefly in hard      weather. But, chronic underinflation wears tires unevenly,      too fast,-and can lose you up to 2% fuel efficiency      for each pound of pressure the tires are low. Five pounds      low means a loss of 10% of your gas money, a 10% waste of      limited petroleum resources, and 10% more needless      emissions in the air.    </p>    <p>      After pot hole time in fall and spring (in snow country),      run your hands over the surface of your front tires even if      they appear to be wearing evenly. If you feel      stillinvisible sharp ridges on one side of the tread      grooves, your alignment needs checking. Fix it before wear      becomes visible, and your tires will last tens of thousands      of miles longer.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to have tires rotated and wheels balanced once or      twice a year to further even out wear. With a good tire      costing the better part of a hundred bucks these days, the      expense would be more than justified even if you weren't      saving gas money and finite natural resources.    </p>    <h3>Backyard Mechanic</h3>    <p>      Whether you do it yourself, go to a Jiffy-Lube, or to the      local mechanic, if you intend to keep a vehicle running for      twice the 100,000 miles the makers expect, change      lubricants at half the recommended intervals, and grease      all the joints for steering and suspension connections.      Better yet, buy a grease gun and hit those spots whenever      you like. Change engine oil at 3,000 miles rather than      7,500 and all running-gear lubes annually at least.    </p>    <p>      Engines are happiest running hot at hi revs. If you do a      lot of stop-and-start driving and/or travel short distances      (under ten miles) so the engine can't heat up enough to      burn the oil clean, water and really evil corrosive agents      can build up. If the car sits for prolonged periods between      such short trips, the engine can be ruined at under 10,000      miles. Under these conditions (the hardest on an engine)      you should change oil every six months at minimum even if      it looks clear and clean.    </p>    <p>      And-under any driving regimen-spend a few bucks      more for the new synthetic lubes such as Mobil 1. These are      made from petrochemicals so you aren't saving petroleum,      but they do retain a constant viscosity under severe      conditions. Mobil 1 resists thinning at hi temps and will      flow at - 55°F-to say nothing of normal cold      winters when mineral oil will thicken and fail to pump up      into the engine to do its job till heated. By that time,      engine wear can be considerable. Synthetics have also been      shown to reduce engine wear, deposit less varnish, and      reduce oil consumption by eight times as compared to      mineral oils.    </p>    <p>      Always follow manufacturers' recommendations as to      lubricant grades. But, if possible, buy the new EC grades      of oil. EC stands for Energy-Conserving. These oils contain      less phosphorous that can ruin catalytic converters. They      also increase gas mileage by .5% to 1.4%.    </p>    <p>      Keep your cooling system filled with fresh antifreeze (to      strengths on label or owner's manual) even if you don't      live in snow country. It contains powerful anticorrosives      as well as freeze-proofers. If possible, have the coolant      overhauled annually at a garage, and have them backflush      the system at the same time. (If replacing your own,      dispose of the old coolant at a garage or a recycler. Don't      just let it drain away in the grass; the stuff is toxic to      plants and animals.)    </p>    <p>      You should check the thermostat (inside a metal housing      near the hose outlet) periodically for buildup of crud.      Clean it out and (especially if the heater has been running      hot or cold) replace it every few years. See your owner's      manuals for the thermostat temperatures recommended and      your repair manual for replacing the thermostat (get a tube      of liquid gasket to augment the paper gasket that comes      with a new thermostat).    </p>    <p>      Check hoses for cracking and leaks. Tighten clamps if they      permit. If clamps are not able to be tightened and you see      a green buildup around the hose mouth, there is a small      leak that could escalate at any time.    </p>    <p>      Inspect the cooling system hoses while you're at it. Drain      system, remove a new hose, inspect, and reattach with a new      clamp. Replace older hoses (all of them), installing with      new clamps. Be sure to clean the outlets that hoses slip      over to remove stuck-on hose liner, corrosion, and mineral      buildup. Otherwise the hose may not fit cleanly, and leaks      will recur.    </p>    <p>      The best thing you can do to keep the cooling system clean      is to add distilled water any time the coolant level drops.      It only costs a dollar a gallon or so at any drug store.      Distilled water lacks the minerals that are found in most      water supplies and that build up as water is lost to      evaporation, clogging the narrow channels in the engine      radiator and heater core.    </p>    <p>      Most fluid changes are a routine drain and fill, but      automatic transmissions take longer and entail replacement      of the filter. Hi-tech systems may be even more involved.      ABS brake systems, for example, must be drained annually,      or old, watery fluid can ruin the sensitive electronics.      Electronic test gear and experience is required, and the      job is costly-but if you don't have it done, a new      ABS system costs thousands of dollars.    </p>    <p>      As a rule of thumb, halve all manufacturer-specified      intervals between routine maintenance procedures, and your      car will be on the way to lasting almost forever. MOTHER      doesn't personally guarantee this formula of course. But      auto manufacturers want their cars to last just long enough      to make you happy enough to buy another new one. Lubes      deteriorate under the heat and thrashing of use, and engine      oil carries off combustion by-products that can build up      and rust the engine from the inside out. You can't go wrong      replacing them more often than Toyota, Honda, Ford,      Chrysler, or The General recommend.    </p>    <h3>Finish</h3>    <p>      Unless your owner's manual warns otherwise (some      traditional finishes should be allowed to dry for a few      weeks), apply a good non-wax, rub-on-and-polish auto polish      such as NuFinish by ReedUnion Corp (in the orange plastic      containers). Apply to shiny paint, chrome, and other shiny      metal. Don't put on tires, other rubber, or plastic of any      kind. Follow with a second coat in a month, and it will      last six months or longer.    </p>    <h3>A Code Reader</h3>    <p>      Today's computerized vehicles have a reputation for mystery      that the aftermarket is finally attempting to dispel. For      some time now re-programmed chips have been available to      give selected cars added acceleration and speed. And now,      several firms are producing devices that can actually      extract repair information hidden in your vehicle's      computer. Shops have multi -thousand-dollar consoles to get      this data, but you can buy a little handheld code-reader      for from $50 to $400. You'll also need a good manual      describing emissions controls and engine management      systems, a book of codes, and (possibly) a special plug to      adapt the reader to your vehicle. Haynes Automotive Manuals      are one source. Call (805) 498-6703 for a list. The JC      Whitney Catalog, (312) 4316102, lists books and      code-readers. Any custom auto shop will be able to get      others. (They appear two years after each model      year-after warranties run out.)    </p>    <p>      When the engine acts funny or the fearsome CHECK ENGINE      light fires up, get out manual and meter, put a jump wire      or two into the computer panel, plug in the reader, punch a      button, and a sequence of lights blink, or you get an LED      reading. The code book tells you what the problem is, and      you are on your way to becoming your own service person.    </p>    <h3>Snow-Country Long-Life Specials</h3>    <p>      More than 90% of engine wear occurs on start-up. Grinding a      cold engine over and over in cold weather shortens life of      starter, battery, engine, and your temper. Have an engine      block heater installed and plug it in on cold nights. Carry      a long outdoor power cord and hook it up at work too if the      day will be cold.    </p>    <p>      Highway salt hastens rusting. It is at its worst in warmish      weather when it dissolves in slush and water, and is      splashed up to penetrate into all the crevices of your      vehicle. Wash the vehicle frequently-including an      underbody power spray. If you are buying a new vehicle,      make sure it is undercoated at the factory. If it isn't,      there are more than a dozen aftermarket undercoating      applications you can do. Don't live without it in cold      regions.    </p>    <p>      Almost as important is keeping the under-carriage well      oiled. After your initial work over, a professional can do      it best with a hi-powered applicator. Be sure they use new      oil (not used, toxin-laced oil). Have it applied annually      well before the start of salt-season. Reapply after every      half-dozen underbody power washes.    </p>    <h3>Major Preventive Maintenance</h3>    <p>      Chase your rights under the new-car warranty so long as it      lasts. Then, to preclude serious problems, begin a program      of scheduled replacement of wearing parts. Use the dealer's      parts store (if possible) for replacements. Major failures      cannot then be attributed to you for installing a faulty      part made of God-knows-what. Keep a log of your maintenance      as well.    </p>    <p>      But, customize the list to your vehicle and fine-tune      replacement times with your mechanic and other owners.      Between 80,000 and 120,000 miles you should have replaced      all wearing components except for the engine block and,      perhaps, the transmission, which can last for amazing time      periods if provided with good care and treatment. They      won't last forever, however, and you may want to save up      cash. A good used engine will cost $700 to $1,200      installed; a rebuilt transmission, the same. If the vehicle      is in outstanding shape, you may want an all-new engine. It      will cost $2,500 and up; a rebuild, perhaps half that. All      other jobs will cost substantially less. Spread out over      several years, you'll hardly notice the cost-and at      the end of the rebuild period, you'll have virtually a new      vehicle and no monthly payments.    </p>
