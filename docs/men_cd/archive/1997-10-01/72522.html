            		    <p>      <strong>Bits and Pieces</strong>    </p>    		<p>		<strong>Mites give bees a run for their      honey.</strong>		</p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Joyce Yeung    </h5>        <p>      Imagine a world without bees. Now imagine that same world      without flowers, without honey, without strawberry plants.      What most of us don't realize and what beekeepers have been      saying all along is that the fate of this tiny buzzing      insect affects us in many inexplicable ways. Next time a      bee advances annoyingly close to you, don't swat at it. The      sad truth is: wild bees are in trouble.    </p>    <p>      The decrease in bee populations is in no way sudden. What      has been an ongoing problem is the result of an attack by      two predominant types of mites: varroa mites ( <em>V.      Jacobsoni</em> ) and tracheal mites ( <em>A. Woodi</em> ).      While beekeepers have had some measured success in mite      controls, it is the wild honeybees that are suffering the      greatest loss.    </p>    <p>      The smallest of the two mites is the tracheal mite. It      lives in the breathing tubes of adult honeybees and sucks      their blood, causing adult bees to become disoriented and      weak. The best known control for tracheal mites is a      menthol treatment in the spring when the weather is warm      and in late summer or fall of the year immediately      following honey extraction. For a homemade treatment,      enclose fifty grams (1.8 oz.) of crystalline menthol in a      7" x 7" plastic screen bag or equally porous material and      place inside the colony for 20-25 days. If daytime      temperature does not exceed 80Â° F, menthol should be      placed on the top bars of the colony; during hot weather,      it is better to place it on the bottom board. There should      be no honey supers on the hive during the treatment, and      the menthol should be taken out of a colony at least a      month before any anticipated flow.    </p>    <p>      The varroa mite, originating in Asia, has spread to almost      all parts of the world and is especially destructive to      honeybee colonies. The adult female mites attach to the bee      between the abdominal segments or body regions, and so are      difficult to detect. The varroa mite attacks bees at their      pupae, larvae, and adult stages, causing deformities like      shortened abdomens, misshapen wings, and deformed legs, and      eventually leading to death. Beekeepers are currently      fighting the varroa mite with Apistan chemical strips      placed in the hive at set times of the year.    </p>        <p>      What the toll of the mites means to consumers is the      reduction of many valuable crops and a dramatic rise in      honey prices. Honeybees pollinate some 90 different crops      in the U.S. including melons, squash, broccoli, almonds,      strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries. An estimated      one third of the world food supply depends on insect      pollination, either directly or indirectly. As the bee      population decreases, many fruits or vegetables might be of      such poor quality or low quantity that they will disappear      from supermarkets.    </p>    <p>      The results of an International Bee Research Association      conference held last October showed that an integrated      approach combining several methods of control is most      successful. Beekeepers should also deal with infested      colonies immediately, lest they risk the possibility of      contamination to neighboring hives, according to the      American Beekeeping Federation.    </p>    <p>      Keeping in mind that bees are essentially nature's great      pollinators, Dr. Leonard Feldman, president of the pest      control company Whatever Works, is promoting the sale of      Orchard Mason Bees. According to Dr. Feldman, "The Orchard      Mason Bees are wonderful for pollinating apples, pears,      cherries, and almonds. In addition to being effective      pollinators, they're non-aggressive and quite safe to      propagate in the suburban and urban backyards. They require      minimal attention." While Orchard Mason Bees are not honey      producers, they are also not affected by the mites that are      felling honeybees. To order a tube of Orchard Mason Bees      for $29.99, contact Whatever Works at 1-800-499-6757, or      write them at the Earth Science Building, 74 20th Street,      Brooklyn, NY 11232 for a catalog.    </p>    <p>      For further information on mites and/or bees, contact the      American Beekeeping Federation at P.O.

Yet <em>Women Who      Fish,</em> which premiered in September, is the first      mainstream publication dedicated solely to female anglers.      Lyla Foggia, publisher and editor of the newspaper and      author of the book <em>REEL WOMEN. The World of Women Who      Fish,</em> says, "Fishing for women is about more than      catching fish, which is why this publication is long      overdue."    </p>    <p>      <em>Women Who Fish</em> aims to address the sport from a      woman's unique perspective. According to Foggia, "Men and      women look at fishing in entirely different ways. For men,      it's more of a non-personal, scientific method to the      sport, whereas for women, it's more emotional. A study done      in 1996 showed that a majority of women fish to be with      family and friends, and not because of the attraction of      big fish." Foggia promises that <em>Women Who Fish</em>      will be a very "emotional" newspaper-one unlike the      more than 100 publications currently in print that examine      just the how-to's of fishing. For example, every issue will      feature "Meditations from the Heartland"-excerpts of      women fishers' experiences and thoughts on the sport, guest      columns by women in the sport, coverage of noteworthy      events, notice of conservation and public service projects,      and book previews.    </p>    <p>      For an annual subscription of 4 quarterly issues, send a      check for $12.00 to WOMEN'S REEL NEWS, PO. Box 939,      Welches, OR 97067.

No, it's not the latest development in long-term weather      prediction. That's the day solar homeowners across the      country will be opening their doors to the 5th annual      National Tour of Solar Homes, sponsored by the American      Solar Energy Society (ASES), the U.S. Department of Energy,      and the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. The tour will      include over 500 homes in more than 36 states.    </p>    <p>      According to Susan LeFever, communications director at      ASES, the goal of the tour is best relayed through this      year's theme, "Real Places for Real People." Her hope is      that people will start to see solar power as a clean,      efficient, and inexpensive energy source, rather than some      futuristic or high- tech idea. "Solar power has been      portrayed in the past as too expensive, too technically      complex for the average home, or aesthetically unappealing,      but attitudes are changing as more people see first-hand      what it's about:'    </p>    <p>      Clay Turnbull, from Townshend, VT, showed his home last      year and is planning on doing so again in October. He      noticed that most of the tour-goers were interested in      living in solar homes, but for different reasons. Turnbull      says of his own decision: "I personally wanted to leave as      small of a footprint as possible on this earth. I was      willing to assume the responsibility of energy      consumption:"    </p>        <p>      Tours generally include anywhere from five to fifteen      homes, depending on geographic location. Local tours will      be organized by Local Coordinating Organizations      nationwide.    </p>    <p>      For information about showing your home or attending a      tour, call the American Solar Energy Society at (303)      443-3130 or e-mail ases@ases.org .
