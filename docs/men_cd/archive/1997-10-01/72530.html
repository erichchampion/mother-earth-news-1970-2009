            		    <p>      <strong>Mother's Interview</strong>    </p>        <p>      The future of the auto is nothing like its past.    </p>        <p>      One of the only noticeable differences between the car of      today and the car of my childhood is that these days I can      never get the darn window down; there are too many little      button controls all over. I don't consider this a real      improvement. While today's car is capable of locking      itself, turning off its own lights, and cooling its      interior, adding on more amenities has only succeeded in      making the car more complicated. Adding on amenities hasn't      done much for fuel efficiency and overall design either,      and there's a whole pack of Americans who'd rather drive an      old car than a new one, if for no other reason than they      like to keep some things-like rolling down a window      or changing the oil-within the realm of human      abilities.    </p>    <p>      It's hard to imagine, with the runaway-train progression of      technological advances in computers, electronics, and      synthetic materials, how Detroit will be able to continue      rolling out new models based on old designs in the 21st      century. There is an increasingly popular theory incubating      in places like universities, think tanks, and even among      some (mostly foreign) auto manufacturers that the      technology of cars is no longer applicable to cars. Let's      just imagine Detroit's worst nightmare for a minute: What      if a consortium of high-tech computer and electronics      manufacturers and leaders from the aerospace and sporting      goods industries pooled their intellectual and physical      resources to redesign the car from the ground up? What      materials would they use, and what structure would they      use? What operating systems and fuel system would they use?      What kind of car would it be?    </p>            <p>      As it turns out, these questions are no longer      hypothetical. Scientists at the Rocky Mountain Institute in      Snowmass, Colorado are in the final stages of organizing a      consortium of high-tech manufacturers to make real a      concept they have developed called "the hypercar." It will      be a hybrid electric vehicle, combining the power of a      conventional internal combustion engine with an electric      motor powered by batteries having four to five times the      capacity of today's standard car battery. It will be made      of polymer composites rather than steel, created to be      incredibly light and fuel efficient, capable in its best      design of getting somewhere around 200 MPG in traffic. The      design of the car is a flexible one, based solely on what      industries decide is most efficient. Rocky Mountain      Institute research associate Michael Brylawski sums up the      hypercar concept: "The key to the hypercar is it combines      these ultrasafe, ultrastrong materials that are light for      fuel efficiency with a hybrid electric drive system in a      very slippery, aerodynamic package." Rocky Mountain      Institute's engineers see a day very soon when owning a car      will be a lot like owning a personal computer. You will not      buy a new car as often as you might "upgrade" your old car,      adding software, doubling your capacity, and so on. This      upgradable car made of light materials will be easy to      reuse and recycle. The overall environmental benefits will      be great but are almost a fringe benefit of a more      efficient design. According to the philosophy of the Rocky      Mountain Institute, the point is not to make an "eco-car."      The point is to make a better all-around car.    </p>    <p>      In addition to developments in technology, recent policy      initiatives have created a hospitable climate for the      hypercar concept to become a reality. Automakers are now      preparing to meet the requirements of President Clinton's      Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, a joint      government-industry project that requires the Big Three      domestic automakers to design affordable vehicles that get      up to 80 MPG by the year 2003. California has also passed a      law requiring 10 percent of the vehicles in the state to be      zero-emissions vehicles by 2003. The hypercar would qualify      as zero emissions equivalent in a new category currently      being considered by the California Resources Board. (If      adopted, the category would only apply to California at      this point.) Rocky Mountain Institute hopes that the      hypercar demonstration project, built by the consortium,      can have an impact on the way the car industry re sponds to      these government edicts. Without mentioning the names of      hightech companies who have begun devoting resources to the      demonstration hypercar, RMI scientists predict the      consortium is on the verge of beginning construction. And,      they say, with or without the cooperation of the American      automobile industry, cars based on the hypercar concept      will likely be on the market within 5-10 years.    </p>    <p>      The Rocky Mountain Institute is a not-for-profit think tank      near Aspen that develops market-oriented solutions to      environmental problems. Their offices, in the highly      resource-efficient home of founders Hunter and Amory      Lovins, are a working model of sustainable living. With      16-inch thick foam-filled stone masonry walls, double-paned      argon gas-filled windows, and a small solar panel system,      the Lovins's heating fuel for the entire winter in the      snowy, cold, high Rockies is a half a cord of firewood. The      place is warm enough to support tropical plants including      bananas, grapes, guava, and papaya, and is a working      demonstration of high-tech devices-from the washing      machine to the light bulbs-for sustainable living.      While visiting RMI, I sat down with three of the      institute's scientists who have been working on the      development of the hypercar concept. We held a round table      discussion about the barriers to and the possibilities for      developing a better car.    </p>    <p>      -Molly Miller    </p>		    <p>      <strong>Michael Brylawski</strong> is the research      associate for advanced-composites manufacturing economics.    </p>    <p>      <strong>David Cramer</strong> is the senior research      associate for materials and manufacturing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dr.</strong> <strong>Jonathan Fox</strong> is the      senior research associate for emissions, air quality, and      transportation.    </p>    <p>      <strong><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>:</strong> What are the barriers      that have kept manufacturers from applying new technology      to develop more efficient automobiles?    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Automakers are very conservative,      technologically. No automaker is willing to move as fast as      technology would allow, due to cultural inhibitions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> The reason that you don't see      the technological change-even though the technology      is available, and can be implemented if energy is put that      way-is that the automakers are very used to making a      certain type of car that uses steel as its main material,      is internal combust-has an internal combustion      engine-with gasoline as its fuel. And, they have over      seven decades of experience and refinement in this      technology so it's very comfortable... very familiar. And      the level of refinement is so high, the level of investment      in how to build these cars is so great, that it's very      difficult to switch over tomorrow and say: We're going to      start building hypercars. There's so much what they call      "cultural inertia" in the automakers to prevent that.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER.</strong> Also, you have to think, in the      past 20 years there have been many different consumer      desires and policy changes that have incrementally pushed      cars a certain way.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN</strong> : Environmental policies?    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Environmental policies,      crash-safety standards, just people wanting more air      conditioning-air conditioning is a standard in      vehicles-these sorts of amenities. And the way that's      been handled is by, if they want an air conditioner, you      add air conditioning. But you don't change how the whole,      you know, climate control system is. You're still making      the same car, but you're just adding an air conditioner. So      it's tended to make cars heavier, more expensive, less fuel      efficient.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> One of these barriers has been the      economics of cars in this country, and that is that the      higher-end cars, that happen to be less efficient,      generally subsidize the lower-end cars. So the Ford Escort      may have never made a dollar for Ford-but the bigger      cars that they make have a much higher profit margin in      them. It essentially subsidizes the more efficient, smaller      lighter cars.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Right. So, we think we'll see many      different types of players trying to enter the automotive      market.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> New car companies?    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Potentially new car companies. Maybe      a consortium or two, some computer manufacturers, and maybe      even some traditional automotive manufacturers from foreign      countries, that aren't as committed with their resources to      the steel-stamping industry that is so prevalent in this      country.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> I think it's kind of interesting what      you said earlier about the car industry not being willing      to take a blank slate look at redesigning the car. But the      electric vehicle almost is that to too much of an extent. A      hybrid is almost an amendment to the regular car, as      opposed to totally taking out its entire fuel system. Your      car has batteries and a fuel system just like today's cars.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> To the consumer, but not to the      producer. I mean, to GM, this is...    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> This is a totally new manufacturing      process?    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER.</strong> Yes, in fact, it's even more of an      issue with design. An electric car-it seems like when      people design an electric car, they say, "Let's start from      a clean sheet and build an electric car." But if you say,      "If we start from a clean sheet and [just] build a car;"      then what do you get? Well, we think you get a hypercar.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> And most electric cars today      are basically conventional cars that they've stripped out      conventional processes and put in batteries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Except for the EV-1, which would be      an incredible car if it wasn't carrying around that mass of      batteries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> So what happened to this wave of      electric vehicles? Now they're switching to hybrids. Did      they all decide no one's going to pay $25,000 to buy an      electric car?    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> At least $25,000.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Yeah, that's one of the fundamental      problems with electric cars, is that they're more expensive      and they don't provide the same functionality as today's      cars. So they're relegated to being niche vehicles. And      that's one of the fundamental differences between the      hypercar concept, if it comes to fruition, is that it can      have widespread availability in the market.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Because it's going to be cheaper.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> The goal will be to be cheaper but,      actually, because it'll be a better car. It'll provide all      of the same attributes that users want today and meet the      ones they'll want tomorrow-such as improved safety,      and amenities, and also range. That's where the electric      cars fall off is range, and also subtle environmental      problems like battery recycling and disposal. When you have      1,500 pounds of batteries, it's a huge mass that you have      to deal with every two to three years if they've been      working correctly. And there's no real experience how well      they're going to work.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> The main issue with that is      that battery vehicles do have emissions: they come from      power plants. We call them "elsewhere-emissions vehicles."      The emissions that you could get at the tailpipe of a      hypercar aggregated could be less than a battery-electric      car even under the cleanest scenarios.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> How quickly do you think hypercar      technology will be incorporated into marketable      automobiles?    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> It depends on what kind of a      hypercar you're talking about because they're all      different. "Hypercar" is just a concept; it's not a      specific technology. So some of the near-term hypercars      won't get the 200-mile-per-gallon figures-maybe more      towards 80-and they won't have fuel cells which      produce virtually no pollution. They may have a gas      turbine. These cars could come out, we think, within a      decade.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> And perhaps within five years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI</strong> Because, for example, if you      take GM's EV-1 car, and you made it into a hybrid, you'd      have a two-seater hypercar.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Pretty close to a hypercar.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Is the EV-1 made out of light      materials?    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> It is made out of light materials,      it's very aerodynamic ...    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> But it costs $34,000.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> The average price of a new car today      is $22,000. The EV-1 is a niche vehicle, two-seater sports      car. It's priced about right for its class.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> So the first hybrid-electric are not      going to be mass-produced, inexpensive cars?    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> It's unlikely. I mean, it's more      likely that they'll be the high-end cars, and it'll diffuse      down rapidly because it'll be a simpler, cheaper way to      make a batch of cars.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> It's generally the standard      operating procedure of new technology    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> One important thing about this is,      we're not saying that this would be the first hypercar.      [Because automakers may have their own developments using      these technologies. Ford's P2000 comes awfully close to the      hypercar concept.] But what this demonstration project will      do is build a hypercar right.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> With our vision and with the      resources we identified through multiple years of research      as being the most viable technologies to go into this      platform. And, really, the main focus is to demonstrate      manufacturability of hypercars at a low cost. We know we      can build one of anything. That's what this country is      really good at.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER.</strong> But can you make them at all      competitive with existing products?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> And how far along are you in getting      together a consortium for the demonstration project?    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> We have very interested parties that      haven't signed on any dotted lines but have committed      resources to the project, such as engineers and materials.      And many of these are materials that haven't been in the      automotive market traditionally. So these players are very      interested in opening up a new market for themselves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> And are there some people who have      been in the automotive industry?    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Yes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Can you say who?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ALL:</strong> No    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> What about a time line for when that      might happen?    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Our personal goal, in terms of the      Hypercar Center, is to have the product finished early      enough to have an influence in where the Original Equipment      Manufacturers are going with their block programs and their      project programs. The PNGV [Partnership for the New      Generation of Vehicles] is trying to determine what are      going to be the best technologies to produce an      80-mile-per-gallon car that the government has challenged      them to do.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> The PNGV deadline is 2003, and      they're rolled back one deadline already, so that's not      etched in stone. But we'd like to be done far enough ahead      of that so that we can have a positive influence in their      thinking and the way they're viewing it, because they're      getting close to our line of thinking with this Ford      car-the P2000-which is essentially an aluminum      aerodynamic lightweight vehicle. It's not as light as an      advanced composite car could be.    </p><p><strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> But the other thing about the    demonstration vehicle, we're go ing to try to be very    flexible in the technol ogy. Because what Jon said is very    important-just as there was a lock-in on steel cars and    internal-combustion engines, there may be a tendency to lock    in the technology for the next generation of vehicles. For    example, the materials competition, where you have steel,    which is rapidly trying to shed its own mass due to design    principles, aluminum, and the polymer industry, all fighting    to become the dominant material in the new automobiles. And    it may be tempting for automakers to lock into one choice. We    emphasize composites, but we have specs. The hypercar, once    again, is a concept and if a metal can achieve the safety and    mass production requirements that a hypercar would need to be    very efficient yet high-performance, all for the better,    basically.</p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Right. We're not wed to any one      particular technology or material.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> So in the vehicle you designed, you      don't name anything too specifically.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Right. So sometimes people say,      "Well, I want to see your hypercar." We say, "No, no, no,      it's a concept; it's an approach to building cars."    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> One of the main criticisms of      designing an auto using light materials is the safety      factor. Are we safer in bigger cars?    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Well, first of all, there's a big      misconception there in that we're not talking about small      cars; we're talking about light cars. And, you can have a      car the size of a Ford Taurus that's half the mass, and you      can have it be just as crashworthy because the materials      that you'd use, and the way you'd design the car, can      absorb energy just as well as the other car.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> But the other thing is, what's      happening in the market today is this mass armament-type      phenomenon, where sport-utility vehicles are becoming more      and more popular.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> So would you consider this trend an      obstacle to this idea?    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Well, it's also an obstacle to      general demeanor on the road. If I'm driving a Ford      Expedition, then I might be making myself safer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> But not necessarily.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Not necessarily. But I'm also      putting everyone else that I might hit, or who might hit      me, at a higher risk because I'm putting them at a      disadvantage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> And the federal government recently      acknowledged this, and there's talk of regulating the      weight of sport-utility vehicles. Sport-utilities are heavy      cars, but they're not very safe. They roll over very      easily, and over half the accidents today that kill people      are not collisions; they're single-car accidents. And so      when you get these vehicles where people feel safe, they're      driving faster than they should-they're actually      exceeding the limits of the vehicles. So there's the notion      of perceived safety, which is what makes you buy a big car,      and then there's the actual safety. Does that big car      absorb energy in a crash? Many of these big cars are so      stiff that if they hit a very solid tree, it transmits the      shock directly to the occupants. And that's much less safe      then hitting it in a light car that's designed to absorb      its own energy, so there's a lot of mitigating factors.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> We emphasize these technologies      in the hypercar concept can be used to make a sport-utility      car as well.    </p>        <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> A hyper-sports-utility?    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Yes, I mean, everything that people      like in sport-utility vehicles-not just safety, but      durability and ruggedness, and what have you-is part      of the actual technology of the hypercars. For example, our      electric drive system has very high torque at low speed.      The application could be towing capacity or hill climbing.      And composite materials are incredibly durable. If people      really want big vehicles, you could have      hyper-sports-utilities.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> And many traditional cars are being      made with composites, as energy-absorbing elements, in      their bumpers. So we're essentially building that into the      car from the ground up, as opposed to adding it on.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Let's talk about the inherent good or      evil of cars in general. Living and working in a remote      part of Colorado, I assume you guys do a lot of driving      around...    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> No, we bike everywhere.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> I own two cars, but 80% of my miles      are on bicycle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> There's some irony there, considering      your life's work. If you feel you should ride your bike      everywhere, wouldn't you also feel we should be working to      encourage a less car-oriented society?    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> We have two main philosophies      on that. The first one is that [hyper]cars solve two of the      most major transportation-oriented problems, which are air      and oil-oil security, the problems we've had in the      Middle East, etc. Amory says it's basically like finding an      OPEC under Detroit in terms of how much oil we could save      if everybody had these technologies. And then, of course,      air quality.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> But cars aren't the only way to solve      those problems.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Right. If everyone left their cars      at home and weren't driving them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Right. But, when people live in      suburbs today, there's no way they can get to work when      there's no infrastructure.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> So, we have to accept the prevalence      of cars?    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> In the short term.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> It isn't a panacea, but it can      significantly help those two problems. And then it'll allow      us to focus more effort on problems that it doesn't solve,      in terms of equity and mobility and congestion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Another problem with cars is that      they are largely responsible for urban sprawl.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Well, the thing is, technology      changes can occur relatively rapidly. Demographic shifts      and changes in land use happen over decades. And if we can,      within a decade, get the hypercar on the road and start      helping the environment while, concurrently, RMI's Green      Development program helps to rethink land-use planning and      building design, and to promote resource-efficient living,      then we start going to a larger system of transportation.      It's a path to sustainability, but it's a necessary      element.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Right. And also-when we look at      how the United States exports its culture, so that the      desires of other countries are really to have      automobility-one thing we want is for them to      leapfrog the development path that we took.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> You mean the Third World?    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Third World. China, as an example of      a country that has tremendous economic wealth: they have a      middle class of 200 million people that can afford to buy      cars today. They just don't have 'em-but they want      them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> The conventional automakers are      putting their meat hooks-they're taking their      obsolete technologies into these countries, their old      tooling, their old technologies.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> That is not the path that we want      them to go on. And they don't really want it, either. So      we're saying: China, why don't you rethink this development      path, and go right to a hypercar-based economy? Those are      the kinds of low hanging fruit that really could make a      transformation. I'm not saying that cars are their mobility      solution at all-but, to some extent, they're going to      be going with cars. And it might actually be with trucks so      why not make hypertrucks for moving their agricultural      products around China and many other developing countries,      where trucking is actually 80% of their fuel consumption      for farming and agriculture use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> Some environmentalists have      said: Well, if you take away the problems of the cars,      you're going to have more cars; you're going to make cars      perfect. But, we emphatically think that if you solve some      of the problems, you can again focus your attention on      other ones like congestion and land-use planning.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOX:</strong> Cars may be our enemies, but we see      them as the means to getting to a point where we can      rethink how we actually use them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Anything else you'd like to add?    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRAMER:</strong> Just essentially what we're      talking about is a car that if your average person walked      into the dealership and saw the hypercar-it could be      a hyper-Taurus, it could be a hyper-Suburban, or a      hyper-Miata-they'd buy it, because they'd think it's      a better car...whether they care about the environment or      not.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> I might want one.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRYLAWSKI:</strong> We'll try to get you one in ten      years.    </p>    <p>      For more information about the Hypercar contact the Rocky      Mountain Institute, 1739 Snowmass Creek Rd, Snowmass, CO      816549199.
