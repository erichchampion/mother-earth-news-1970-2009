                <p>      <strong>Garden & Yard</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Use your own backyard to save heirloom seeds from      extinction.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Kirsten Whatley    </h5>        <p>      Consider the seed, a tiny speck, seemingly lifeless, that      one day will expand thousands of times its size to become a      sunflower or corn stalk, or a 60-foot redwood. Think of the      potential waiting in each seed, the diversity of life it      carries, the memory of its ancestors of how to grow and      make more seed, how to adapt to the sunlight and soil      around it.    </p>    <p>      Now consider your relationship to the seed. Once a society      of foragers, our food supply today depends on agriculture.      We've intervened in nature's flow of continually fruiting      and re-seeding itself and carrying on each species'      evolution. We've become stewards of the seeds,      domesticating many of them, taking responsibility for their      success or demise.    </p>    <p>      We may shop at the farmer's market or whole foods store; we      may even consider ourselves self-sufficient, growing our      own produce. But where do our seeds come from? Most likely      the garden center or the pages of seed catalogs that appear      every year in our mailboxes.    </p>        <p>      So we plant these seeds and harvest their fruits and next      year start the whole process again. And there's the catch.      Every year we must return for a fresh supply of seed      because what the large, modern seed companies provide us      with are hybrids-the products of mixed parentage with      seeds that are sterile or simply won't reproduce true to      form. Open-pollinated varieties, on the other hand, are the      keepers of genetic diversity; they can't be owned. Just as      we come from different cultural backgrounds, evolving      through diverse social and environmental conditions, so      have the plants around us. This genetic diversity enables      them to survive the most difficult situations, to naturally      resist predators and disease. Diversity, after all, is      nature's protection against extinction. Traditional      open-pollinated varieties carry all the genes of the parent      plant, so we can save their seed each year to create our      own supply. Heirlooms are openpollinated varieties that      have been passed down through generations, selected, and      treasured because they're the most flavorful-and the      most nutritious.    </p>    <p>      Every year new hybrids emerge, and traditional varieties      are crowded out. They can never be replaced, nor can the 20      to 40 animal and insect species that relied on each      variety. Where farmers once grew hundreds of kinds of each      crop, they now grow three or four. This loss of diversity      not only affects our food supply but our health when      nutritional value is compromised for traits a commercial      grower demands. We've become unwitting victims of a      dependency on hybrid-producing conglomerates as the source      of our nation's food supply and of the seeds we grow in our      own gardens. What's most distressing is that we're giving      up our right to save seed. We're ending the co-evolution      that began when we brought these plants from the wild into      our backyards.    </p>    <h3>      A Narrow Food Supply    </h3>        <p>      The sweet crimson peppers that hung in shapely clumps in      grandfather's garden, the crisp green cucumbers that      grandma cherished for her pickle jars may only be memories.      Of the food crops available to our relatives in 1900, an      estimated 90 percent have already disappeared. In the last      decade alone, we've lost a steady average of 6 percent of      traditional and heirloom varieties each year. That means      our food system is based on an ever narrowing handful of      crops-a mere 150, of which only 20 produce 90 percent      of the world's food. Of these 20 crops, only      three-wheat, corn and rice-make up half of our      food supply.    </p>    <p>      The danger of this limited food base is that the more      homogeneous our crops, the more susceptible they are to      disease, pests, and drought. All it takes is one fungus to      wipe out an entire crop. Genetically similar potato      planting led to the Irish potato famine of 1845, leaving      millions starving when the country's supply was all but      obliterated. In 1970, a leaf blight struck a gene that      plant breeders had introduced for easier harvesting and      destroyed half the corn from Florida to Texas.    </p>    <h3>      Hybrid Supremacy    </h3>    <p>      Four major companies dominate the US. mail-order market      today, according to Seeds of Change president Stephen      Badger. These multi-national corporations are swiftly      buying out small, family-owned businesses with continued      consolidation of the seed industry occurring all the time.      From 1984 to 1987, almost a quarter of the mail-order seed      companies were taken over or have closed down. Many      traditional collections have been replaced with more      profitable hybrids, their seeds often raised with chemicals      and coated with fungicides and pesticides. "The insidious      part of all this is that (the companies) selling the seeds      are also often selling the chemicals," says John Sabella,      who represents the Rodale Institute in international      training programs related to agriculture. This starts a      cycle of dependency on chemical inputs necessary for the      plant to grow, resist disease and pests, and basically      survive.    </p>    <p>      Large seed companies breed hybrids to target their biggest      customers, the commercial growers. Naturally, these      varieties must meet industrial needs-uniform ripening      for easier machine harvesting; firmer flesh that holds up      to handling, crosscountry shipping, and storage; larger      fruits in eye-popping colors to please the American      aesthetic. Unfortunately, these same seeds are then sold to      the home gardening market. Rather than selecting plants      that provide the greatest nutrition and flavor through      generations of seed saving, they develop those that will      grow in many parts of the United States, appealing to      large-scale farming needs rather than those of a specific      region. Some of these companies have begun offering      heirlooms but more for their quaint and nostalgic      connotations than issues of diversity. Of the almost 5,000      non-hybrids offered in 1984, two-thirds were dropped by      1994. Those left are not so far from extinction themselves;      over 50 percent of all available varieties are only offered      through one mail-order company. We need to grow and      circulate these single-source varieties. We must also grow      the plants that are easiest to hybridize and, therefore,      are disappearing the fastest. These include broccolis,      cauliflowers, cabbages, onions, peas, and sweet      peppers-all of which have shown at least a 25 percent      decrease in varieties offered since 1981.    </p>    <p>      The good news is that new seeds are appearing on the market      at a rate of 10 percent each year. From 1991 to 1994, 1,794      new varieties have been made available to the home      gardener. But this is as deceiving as it is      promising-the increase is concentrated in relatively      few plants. Crops such as corns, garlics, lettuces, hot      peppers, potatoes, and squashes have shown a 200 percent or      more increase in varieties since 1981 while the rest of the      vegetable kingdom continues to decline. (Remember we're      still losing that 6 percent a year mentioned      earlier-gene sources we can never regain.)    </p>    <p>      In the last decade, seed diversity has moved from an      environmental issue to a political one. The need for      control and ownership has prompted seed industry      conglomerates to begin patenting their varieties as      proprietary. Imagine patenting a living, breathing life      form as if it were an invention or commodity. "This is not      like patenting a mouse trap or a new hair dryer; we're      talking about world food security," says Hope Shand,      research director for the Rural Advancement Foundation      International (RAFI). Since 1981, RAN has been studying the      impact of intellectual property-new laws granting      ownership of life forms to patent holders-and how      this threatens farmers, agriculture, and genetic diversity.    </p>    <p>      "The most alarming trend is that farmers are losing control      over their own seed," adds Shand, "even from their own      farms". When a farmer, particularly in a developing      country, finds non-hybrid seed, he must often sign a      contract stating that he relinquishes his right to save      seed from his crops because they are under patent.    </p>    <h3>      Breeding for the Long Term    </h3>    <p>      Not all hybrids are inherently evil. It's the      first-generation hybrids offered by the large commercial      companies that we have to worry about. Some conscientious      plant breeders, like those at Seeds of Change, cross      varieties to yield more flavorful, nutritious food plants      by breeding through several generations beyond the first.      These become more stable with each generation until they      are open-pollinated varieties whose seeds can be saved and      replanted, showing some diversity in successive plantings;      some are bred through enough generations to become      stabilized hybrids, with seeds that will reproduce      identical to the parent plant. This is how plant breeders      initially created the traditional varieties we know today.    </p>    <p>      "This doesn't make sense anymore for the big seed      companies," says Kent Whealy, director of Seed Savers      Exchange, a grassroots organization that for over 20 years      has led the struggle to preserve genetic diversity,      tracking the status of every nonhybrid available in the      United States and Canada since 1981. "Why bother breeding      through several years when you can breed a first-generation      hybrid, keep the parent a secret, and have people come back      every year for more seed?"    </p>    <p>      On the surface, hybridization may lead to more offerings in      the marketplace, but not to greater genetic diversity.      Think of different varieties of the same species rather      than a diverse set of species. We're still reliant on a      single source for the original gene. Moreover, it doesn't      matter how many new varieties arise each year-we're      losing countless others at the mercy of control and profit.    </p>    <h3>      Planting the Future    </h3>    <p>      You may think it impossible for one person to transform the      fate of the world's food supply, but ironically it's the      home gardener who has the power to keep our genetic      diversity alive. "Backyard gardeners are emerging as the      most vitally concerned stewards of this irreplaceable      genetic wealth, and we must quickly accept our      responsibility," says Whealy. "Try to imagine what it would      cost, in terms of time and energy and money, to develop      this many outstanding varieties. But they already exist.      All we have to do is save them."    </p>    <p>      As a nation of immigrants, we have access to seeds from all      parts of the world, seeds that made their way into this      country hiding in suitcase linings or sewn into dress hems.      If these seeds are not handed down, like when an elderly      seed saver passes away, the varieties become extinct. Start      with what you have, swap with neighbors and      relatives-who knows, you may be the only person      growing your grandfather's prized pepper.    </p>    <p>      Then, instead of supporting the multinationals that have      grown to expect your yearly business, look to the new breed      of companies dedicated to bringing disappearing varieties      back into circulation. Take Kent and Diane Whealy who, in      1975, inherited from an elderly relative seeds that were      brought from Bavaria four generations before. With these      few heirlooms they started Seed Savers Exchange, a network      of everyday people across the nation saving and sharing      non-hybrid seed varieties. Since 1975, their members have      distributed an estimated 750,000 samples of garden seeds      not in commercial catalogs and often on the verge of      extinction. Their annual Seed Savers Yearbook lists the      addresses and holdings of more than 1,000 members whose      varieties number almost 12,000twice as many varieties as      are offered through the mail-order seed industry of the      United States and Canada.    </p>    <p>      Of their many publications, the <em>Garden Seed      Inventory</em> is indispensable. A catalog of catalogs, the      <em>Inventory</em> describes 6,483 non-hybrids and the      mail-order companies that carry them; it helps gardeners      locate hard-to-find regional seeds and charts each      variety's rate of decline, flagging those about to be      dropped.    </p>    <p>      In Tucson, Arizona the staff of Native Seeds/SEARCH is      preserving traditional crops and farming methods of the      Southwest and northern Mexico. What started in 1983 as an      informal seed trading network by Native Americans from the      Tohono O'odham nation has become a 44,000-member      organization. Not only do they offer an extensive seed      catalog of native desert crops, they're involved in      projects such as Desert Food for Diabetes, promoting the      use of traditional plant foods to combat adult-onset      diabetes, which affects 60 percent of the Native American      population.    </p>    <p>      Native Seeds/SEARCH's most recent project is a Cultural      Memory Bank, addressing more than just the loss of genetic      diversity but the traditional knowledge and lore that fades      with the extinction of each crop. As they interview farmers      about how a crop is planted, harvested, and cooked, they're      also recording its stories and songs. The information will      then be compiled into a database (with the farmer deciding      if access should be restricted to tribal members or open to      the public) and made available on CD-ROM.    </p>    <p>      Many organizations maintain seed banks where endangered      seeds can be stored and cataloged, but don't underestimate      the power of the individual. Our backyards hold just as      much potential as centers of genetic diversity. "A seed      bank can be as simple as a garden," says the Rodale      Institute's John Sabella. Seeds are only viable for a      limited time, so they must be planted and new seed saved      regularly.    </p>    <p>      "Seed banks are not the solution in and of themselves,"      says RAM's Hope Shand. "There has to be on-farm      conservation, maintenance of the seed on site." And, seed      banks are not infallible. Whether due to power failures or      financial difficulties, "we've seen the destruction of gene      banks all over the world," adds Shand. "We can never depend      solely on seed banks to keep genetic diversity alive."    </p>    <h3>      What to Save First?    </h3>        <p>      So now that you have more varieties than you ever imagined      to choose from, which do you grow first? If you look at the      Seed Savers Exchange <em>Garden Inventory,</em> you'll find      statistics showing the rates of decline and availability      for each variety. Buy those that are declining rapidly. Buy      the seeds that have only been available from a single      source since 1981. Buy those from Asian and European      companies, which are often only available for one year.      These are the seeds we have to save first. Beyond that, buy      and grow and share as many varieties as you can fit in your      backyard.    </p>    <p>      After your garden is buzzing with open-pollinated foods and      flowers, the next step is to save your own seed. The      process itself is simple, but garden planning will take a      little extra effort. Different varieties within the same      species may cross, producing offspring like hybrids. To      keep your seeds pure, you need to select the right plants      and plant combinations. Pollination particulars and methods      for seed cleaning and storage are discussed in detail in      <em>Seed to Seed</em> by Suzanne Ashworth (Chelsea Green,      1995).    </p>    <p>      As our race continues to destroy the habitats where the      wild ones grow, as we manipulate nature to serve our needs,      it becomes our responsibility to carry on life's processes,      to keep the chain of diversity alive. Our ancestors have      passed these seeds to us. Now we become ancestors to the      next generation. All it takes is a spade and a handful of      seed.    </p>
