    <p>
                        <p>      One of the most puzzling questions to grapple with while we      electrify and technologize and work-ethic ourselves into      the twenty-first century is why life is making such an      alarming number of us seriously depressed. Whether we have      grown selfinvolved to the point of absurdity or are finally      managing to alienate ourselves from true spirituality by      burying it under appliances and money and cell-phones,      sadness has simply become epidemic ...and a killer.      According to the National Institute of Mental Health      (NIMH), untreated depression is the number one cause of not      only all alcohol and drug addiction but also all eating      disorders, and the $40 billion of lost work and business      failures is just the visible part of the iceberg. Lurking      underneath are legion suffering children and wives who      endure violence as well as the quiet (and too often      explosively not quiet) suffering of the depressed people      themselves, some twenty million of them in the US. alone.    </p>    <p>      Whether gripped by backwards thinking or not,      pharmaceutical companies have sought the answer in plastic      capsules, and ever since the introduction of MAO      (mono-amino-oxidase) inhibitors in the '70s and the updated      SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors such as      Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil) of the '90s, we have taken the      bait and are currently mortgaging ourselves to drug      companies to the tune of nearly $3 billion a year-for      antidepressant medication alone!    </p>    <p>      It is not for us to decide whether happiness can ever be      found in a bottle, but the quiet revolution in medical care      currently taking place in Europe, and the "miracle herb"      prescribed there (twenty million people taking sixty-six      million doses every day in Germany alone), may herald an      age when we find a way to make health and happiness      something that can be grown as well as bought.    </p>    <p>      This herb, derided for centuries by gardeners as a      bothersome pest, is called St. John's Wort (Hypericum in      more clinical circles). Within the past five years, over      5,000 patients have participated in hypericum      drug-monitoring tests-more than 2,000 of these in      double-blind studies. Eight head-to-head comparisons showed      hypericum was as effective as prescription antidepressants,      but with fewer side effects.    </p>    <p>      According to Dr. Richard Firshein, a columnist for      <em>Psychology Today,</em> "We aren't sure exactly how it      works though we know it inhibits the enzyme that breaks      down dopamine, the 'pleasure' neurotransmitter, and may      also work the way antidepressant drugs do, by inhibiting      the brain's uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine ....The      active ingredient, hypericin, is believed to be responsible      for its mood boosting effects, and the side effects are      usually quite mild."    </p>    <p>      "Mild" may be an understatement. In fact, after 2,400 years      of herbal remedies involving hypericum, not one death from      toxicity has ever been suspected, much less reported. It is      considerably less toxic than aspirin and does not inhibit      sexual desire and performance as Prozac and its cousins do.      In a review of six hypericum studies, the <em>British      Medical Journal</em> reported that 10.8 percent of patients      indicated that they experienced side effects with      hypericum, whereas nearly 36 percent experienced      side-effects with prescription drugs.    </p>    <p>      The kicker is that even if you want to simply go to the      herbal shop and buy Hypericum rather than grow it, the cost      per pill is from one-fifth to one-tenth of what      prescription antidepressants cost, not to mention the fact      that there may be no doctor's visit to pay for.    </p>    <p>      Even those wildly enthusiastic about Hypericum admit that      it works only in mild to moderate cases of depression, that      it takes from four to six weeks to take effect, and that      those currently taking prescription drugs require medical      supervision before switching, but St. John's Wort's      promise, by virtually all accounts, is simply fantastic.      <em>-Matt Scanlon</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Product Name:</strong> <strong>HYPERICUM      VERBATIM<br /></strong> Company: Hypericum Buyer's      Club<br />      Strength: 300 mg.<br />      Type: Scored tablet (breaks into two 150 mg. doses for      children or for adjusting an adult dose; no animal products      used)<br />      Cost: $27.50 for 280 tablets<br />      Cost per day: 29  cents<br />      Available: Mail order<br />      Mail Order Address: Hypericum Buyer's Club, 8205 Santa      Monica Boulevard, Suite 472, Los Angeles, California      90046<br />      Mail Order Telephone: 1-888-HYPERICUM (1-888-497-3742), 24      hours<br />      Shipping & Handling Charge: None<br />      <br />      <strong>Product Name:</strong> <strong>ST.
