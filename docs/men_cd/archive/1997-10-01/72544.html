                <p>      <strong>Land & the Law</strong>    </p>    <p>      You might not be the king and queen of all you survey after      all    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Jean Vernon    </h5>        <p>      Q. Our problem is with wide-load logging trucks (over      10'-wide) running next to our property. The easement      through our place is 10 feet wide, plus there are two short      curves in the road which put them over the easement. This      easement was in use all last year. In time, the logging      company also installed culverts which washed out access to      our home for 21 days. We could not get our autos in and      out. I stopped them for a short while this year, but now      they have a restraining order to ensure they can use the      road for 30 days. We need a good land attorney, one that is      nearby but not associated with the sawmill or the landowner      who is giving us trouble. How do we find one?    </p>    <p>      <em>-Michael Shanda<br />      Forestville, CA</em>    </p>    <p>      A. Good real estate attorneys are not always easy to find,      Michael. You need an expert on easements and one that can      help you mitigate damages caused from the road use,      although you may not be able to stop such use entirely. If      you are concerned about attorneys in your immediate area      being sympathetic to the landowner and the mill, try      finding one in other surrounding towns. To find an expert      attorney, ask several real estate brokers and/or agents.      Also, ask the title companies for the names of attorneys      who handle real estate. By doing this, a pattern will      emerge, and one or more names will stand out. Talk to each      one, and be sure to ask about fees.    </p>    <p>      <em>Q. I own a small farm of 10 acres. I have two acres      between my neighbor and myself that used to be a hayfield.      I no longer farm and simply let the hay grow up. About      three years ago my neighbor asked if he could cut the hay.      Naturally I said yes and was thankful. Since then he has      cut it with his lawn tractor.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Recently someone told me that if a party maintains      another's piece of land, the land could be claimed after      seven years by the one who maintained it. Is this true? I'm      getting worried. Any advice you can give me will be greatly      appreciated.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jim Beltz<br />      Center Valley, PA</em>    </p>        <p>      A. The issue here is whether your neighbor could claim your      land through adverse possession, and you are right to be      concerned about it. The adverse possession laws vary for      each state, regarding the actual conditions that must be      met and the number of years involved. In general such      possession and claim must be (a) <em>hostile</em> , against      the owner's wishes; (b) <em>actual,</em> physically      occupied in a manner consistent with the land (for example:      farm land may be farmed, but the claimant needn't      necessarily live there); (c) <em>notorious</em> , not      hidden; (d) <em>exclusive</em> , not shared with the owner;      and (e) <em>continuous</em> , for the number of required      years. Under claim of right, the claimant must believe he      or she has a valid claim of some sort. ALL of these      conditions must be met for land to be claimed by adverse      possession.    </p>    <p>      An attorney can give you information specific to your state      and make suggestions on how to avoid a claim against your      two acres. It may be as simple as formally giving your      neighbor a written statement allowing him the right to cut      the hay.    </p>    <p>      <em>Q. I enjoyed your article in the July issue. On the      question of easements I feel the property owner usually has      the responsibilities but few benefits. You state that "You      have the right to all production ...crops, for example." My      property has a utility right of way and a state highway      right of way. The easements say I must keep them clear for      access, since</em> <em>they are regularly bush logged and      mowed by the utility and highway departments      respective</em> <em>ly. The only crop I could grow is      grass. As far as I'm concerned, I pay for land I can't do      anything with. Id appreciate your comments.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Joseph KayRoute<br />      Phenix, VA</em>    </p>    <p>      A. Whoa, there. It is time to step back and rethink those      easements. No doubt they existed before you bought your      land, yet you chose to buy it anyway. Those easements do      benefit you directly by providing good access to your land      and readily available power. Though you must allow easement      access, it does not sound as if you are burdened with the      maintenance responsibilities. With regard to profit from      easement land, unless written otherwise, the easement user      generally is not entitled to profit from the land; only the      owner is-provided the land produces anything of      value.    </p>    <p>      <em>Q What, if anything can a person do if they have      land-locked land, surrounded by other property on four      sides? I have had all kinds of answers from "You must be      granted a right of way or easement" to "You have a real      problem." Your outlook on this would be much appreciated.      Though I live in Maine, the property is in      Massachusetts.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-B. H. Fritz<br />      Union, ME</em>    </p>    <p>      A. Whether you will be able to acquire access to      land-locked land in Massachusetts depends on several      factors. Generally, the courts will grant an "easement by      necessity;" but not in every case. If the owner of the      land-locked land created the problem for a deliberate      reason or sold adjacent land without retaining access, then      the chances of obtaining such an easement may be reduced.      The best course to take is to consult a real estate      attorney in the county in which the land is located or to      consult an expert from the Massachusetts Conveyancers      Association, which you can contact at 1-800-496-6799.    </p>    <p>      <em>Q. We bought 6.68 acres that originally were part of a      large dairy that was broken up, with some parcels of land      going to family members and some sold outright. The      original seller's daughter owns land adjacent to ours and      plans to install a mobile home on the rear of her property      for her caretaker. The row of trees that divided our two      parcels was removed years ago. We are concerned that the      mobile home will be installed too close to our land but      cannot afford a survey at this time to establish the true      property line. Thanks for any help you might provide.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jeanette Sharinghousen<br />      Scappoose, OR</em>    </p>    <p>      A. You are right; surveys can be prohibitively expensive.      If you can't bear the cost burden alone, perhaps you two      landowners can share the expense. After all, if the mobile      home is not within the setback lines for your area, it will      probably have to be moved at a later date when the land      lines are established. In the meantime you could simply      measure your property with a 100-foot tape measure to get a      good idea of where your land lines should be. Most Oregon      land is laid out with the government survey method so this      shouldn't be too difficult if your land is rectangular in      shape. If you do not know the exact dimensions of your      land, the county Assessor's Office may be able to give them      to you. Using a compass, start at any one corner you are      reasonably sure of. Measure the length of that line. Mark      the corner, and turn 90Â° to measure the next line.      Proceed around the next two corners in this manner and back      to the point of beginning. Before you start you will have      to determine the declination (degrees off of true north)      for your area and allow for that when reading your compass.      Any surveyor or local map store can give you the      declination.    </p>    <p>      Naturally this method is not as accurate as a survey, but      it will give you a solid idea of the where the line lies      between you and your neighbor. The best course is for an      actual survey to be done as soon as possible.    </p>    <p>      <em>Q. I am a new landowner. This spring a neighbor was      burning the old grass</em> <em>off his place when his fire      spread to my property. I assured him it was doing no harm.      In the ensuing discussion he said it was every landowner's      responsibility to burn the old grass out of the ditch. I      asked him to help me burn out the ditch on my north      boundary, and he agreed. The fire got away, and the      neighbor disappeared. Another neighbor's pump house was      burned, and he was understandably upset. I explained I have      no money to replace the pump house and pump, and I have no      homeowner's insurance due to defects making my house      uninsurable. Yesterday he came by with a quote for a $3,600      pump and $400 for a pump house. His insurance will only pay      $500, and he wants me to pay the rest. l have no money for      this! I don't know the value of the pump but know the pump      house was rickety old. I feel he is asking me to buy him a      Cadillac to replace a Pinto, and I built my own 8'x 10'      shed for less than $400. Can you please tell me what to      do?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Diana Smith<br />      Stevensville, MT</em>    </p>    <p>      A. Whether you like it or not, you are definitely at fault      here and will have to bear up under the responsibility.      Losing a pump and pump house and going without water is a      serious loss to your neighbor. Some suggestions: Find out      what size pump is required and find out what brand of pump      was burned if the neighbor will tell you. Obtain quotes of      your own for replacing the pump and pump house. Even though      his pump house was old, it will cost to replace it, and      though you can build a shed for minimal money, it is not      your neighbor's problem to rebuild his own pump house when      the loss was someone else's fault. Work with him on this,      or you may find yourself in court and may be responsible      for more than just replacement costs. Equally important is      maintaining good relations with your neighbor through this      unfortunate affair. Check with an attorney to obtain more      details about the extent of your obligation in replacing      your neighbor's loss.    </p>    <p>      <em>Q. I am a second generation cattle rancher. There is a      road through my property that the county has always      maintained even though it was never deeded to the county.      The County Highway Act says public funds are not to be      spent on roads that have not been properly acquired. People      have bought land behind me and access their land on that      road. My dad and I have always had cattle on our property      and the road. Recently a judge ruled against me about the      cattle on the road. He said he did not have the authority      to make me fence</em> <em>off</em> <em>the road; however, I      must keep my cattle out of harm's way! He further stated I      could get 100 shepherd dogs to keep my cattle</em>      <em>of</em> <em>of the road. I have advertised in a local      magazine to buy the dogs and am pursuing other measures as      well.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>A fencing company wants $27,557.50 to fence off the      road. With cattle prices down, my cows are only worth      approximately $15,000. Those cattle have been on that road      for 50 years. We are appealing the decision that was made      against us. As more people move to the country, farmers are      having to pay to defend their land and rights. The judge in      essence has condemned my property without      compensation.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Kevin Sanders<br />      Fayetteville, TN</em>    </p>    <p>      A. There is more than one issue here. The first is the      county maintenance of the road. It sounds as if it has      become an easement by prescription, that is, used for so      many years that it became public access. If that is the      case, the county probably has every right to maintain it.    </p>    <p>      The second issue is cattle at large. Even though lengthy,      your letter did not give enough information regarding the      court case against cattle on the road. To adver tise for      shepherd dogs or an animal trainer only begs the issue and      is not a serious effort to solve the problem.    </p>    <p>      If you haven't already, you should definitely contact an      attorney. It is unfortunate that the burgeoning population      is putting more pressure on farmers and ranchers, but you      need to get legal advice on whether to fight the problem or      work to resolve it.    </p>    <p>      <em>Q. I have 1.10 acre. In our town you can build on      1/2-acre. I would like to have my daughter on the back      V2-acre but need an easement. To go from the front of my      land to the back 1/2-acre would take a driveway over</em>      200' <em>long, but going through our neighbor's place on      the side would require a short easement. How do we go about      getting an easement? Do we offer him payment?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Elizabeth Sievess<br />      Lincroft, NJ</em>    </p>    <p>      A. Your daughter and her husband are fortunate to have such      thoughtful generous parents. Generally, when an owner can      provide an easement, even though difficult and lengthy, the      adjacent owner <em>can't be forced to give an      easement.</em> However, you certainly can ask the neighbor      if he will grant an easement. He may, and he may want the      money you are prepared to pay. Consult your city zoning      department, and they'll fill you in on that score.    </p>    <p>      <em>Send your questions to "Country Real Estate," c/o      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, P.
