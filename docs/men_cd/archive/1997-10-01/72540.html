                <p>      <strong>Seasons of the Earth and Sky</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Two billion squirrels can't be wrong.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Fred Schaff    </h5>        <p>      We all know that acorns fall and accumulate on the ground      in autumn, of course. And we all have been reminded at some      time or other that mighty oaks from little acorns grow. But      how often do we really look at this fruit in all its      variety of size, shape, and styling?    </p>    <p>      Each acorn has its cup, but that cup may be very shallow or      may almost completely enclose the nut. The cup may be      rough, prickly, or have smooth scales. The nut itself may      be roundish, tapered, or even cylindrical. The surface of      the acorn nut sometimes has a rather rough finish but may      also have a seemingly waxed or varnished look and feel.      Then there is the color of acorns. The variety is not as      great as that of autumn leaves, but you'll be surprised if      you start picking them up and looking. You'll see mixtures      of green, yellow, and every kind of brown from tan to      mahogany. The hues are muted compared to some autumn      leaves, but perhaps that is a pleasant contrast-and      it seems appropriate for so humble a thing.    </p>    <p>      Acorns come only from oaks. There are two major classes of      oak, the white oak group (with rounded leaf lobes) and      black oak groups (with pointy leaf lobes), and their acorns      are remarkably different in their life-stories as well as      in some other ways.    </p>    <p>      Perfect acorns of the white oak itself are hard to find      because they grow and fall in just a few months, and then      quickly decay or are seized as food by a wide variety of      animals and birds. They're also hard to find because the      white oak doesn't mature enough to bear acorns for about 50      years! In contrast, acorns of the black oak family take two      years to ripen, so some are always on the tree. In fact,      there may be two generations of them, distinguishable by      size, on a tree at once. Furthermore, once these acorns do      fall to the ground, they prove quite resistant to      disintegration and are not a favored food of wildlife      because they are bitter. The acorns of the chestnut oak, a      member of the white oak family, are said to be the sweetest      (in northern forests at least) for human beings to roast      and eat.    </p>    <p>      Can acorns or their gatherers be weather prognosticators?      Some people say that if squirrels are collecting unusually      great numbers of acorns in autumn, a hard winter is sure to      follow. That either trees or squirrels or both could be      affected by a prolonged spell of cool weather in summer or      autumn seems reasonable enough. But temperatures rarely      remain significantly below-average (or above-average) for      several seasons in a row-a very cold autumn is not      frequently followed by a very cold winter. Only factors      like certain ocean current temperature changes in parts of      the mighty Pacific seem to be reliable predictors of what      some regions' general weather will be like months in the      future.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Parade of Planets</strong>    </p>        <p>      During much of October and November 1997 a very unusual      circumstance occurs: all the planets are above the horizon      at one time for a while after sunset! Actually, dim Pluto      is too low in bright sky during these months for anyone to      see, and you need binoculars and detailed finder charts      (like those in <em>Sky &</em> <em>Telescope</em>      magazine's May issue) to locate Uranus and Neptune. A      wonderful feat to try in mid-to-late November, however, is      to see all five of the classic naked-eye planets at one      time. Mercury will be the hardest to see, a bright point of      light but one that appears very low in the west-southwest      before dusk is over.    </p>    <p>      The other four bright planets are easy to spot as long as      your view of the southwest sky is not obstructed. Low in      the southwest for a few hours after sundown are Venus,      brightest point of light in the sky, and Mars, much fainter      but forming a close companion with Venus week after week.      Jupiter is the second-brightest planet and is fairly high      in the south at nightfall. Saturn is the brightest object      rising in the east at nightfall these months.    </p>    <p>      Our Almanac table lists the many, many arrangements of      these planets with each other, with the Moon, and with the      stars. Something to bear in mind is that the separations in      "degrees" can be estimated in a simple way: your fist held      out at arm's length is about 10 degrees wide. Most of the      sights are easily visible to the naked eye, but two of the      most remarkable do require a telescope. They are the hiding      of a star by Jupiter on November 12 and the "grazing      occultation" of Saturn by the Moon on November 11. The      "graze" occurs when Saturn and its rings pass right along      the edge of the Moon so that they are partly visible behind      lunar mountains and valleys for several minutes. The graze      will only be visible in a band several dozen miles wide,      running from southern Texas to southern New Jersey and Cape      Cod (south of the band Saturn goes completely behind the      Moon; north of the band it is a close miss).    </p>    <p>      Another astronomical event to look for is the Leonid meteor      shower, zooming from the southeast in the hours before dawn      on November 17. It is next year and 1999 that the passage      of the Leonids' parent comet may cause this annual display      of shooting stars to burst into a "meteor storm," thousands      of meteors per hour, as seen from some parts of the world.      But last year there was a remarkable display of almost      entirely very bright Leonids. In a single 20-minute period      I saw two Leonids bright enough to light up the landscape      and cast shadows, and the trails left by them remained      visible to the naked eye for several minutes. If a similar      display occurs this year, not even bright moonlight will      severely diminish its splendor.    </p>    <h3>Colors Around the Moon</h3>    <p>      If you ask people who are generally observant of nature      whether they have ever seen lovely colors in clouds passing      by the Moon, some of them will say yes. But how many people      could name those colors and correctly recall the      arrangement of the hues? Very few people know the facts      about lunar coronas.    </p>    <p>      These beautiful patterns of color must be distinguished      from "halos," rings of light which are far larger and which      are caused only by ice crystals in cirrus clouds. The most      famous halo is the huge "ring around the Moon." A lunar      corona occurs in a disk-shaped area right up close to the      Moon. Closest to the Moon is a greenish or bluish color,      bounded on the outside by a thick band of reddish light.      This is the first or innermost set of colors in a lunar      corona, but sometimes there are fainter repetitions of the      sets of colors outside of the first set (blue or green then      red, blue or green then red, and so on.) Lunar coronas can      occur in almost any cloud which is not so opaque as to hide      the Moon altogether, but most of them are caused by clouds      with water droplets, only some of them by high clouds with      ice needles. And, instead of being caused by reflection and      refraction (bending) of light by ice crystals (as is the      case with halos), coronas are caused by a process called      "diffraction." Diffraction occurs when a tiny aperture      (like a pinhole) or particle (like a cloud droplet or ice      needle edge) is similar in size to the wavelengths of      light. Different colors of light are produced by different      wavelengths, and (to simplify) cloud particles can block      light from certain positions around the light source and      intensify others. (Interestingly, the colors we sometimes      see on roads after a rain are formed by the diffraction of      light from incredibly thin deposits of oil on the road      surfaces.)    </p>    <p>      Sometimes clouds are too scattered or too far from the Moon      to reveal the concentric bands of a fully formed corona,      and we just see patches of color here and there on the      clouds as they pass the Moon. We call these "iridescent      clouds":    </p>    <p>      As October gives way to November, the weather in much of      the U.S. becomes much cloudier. Many locations have their      cloudiest conditions of the year in November and December.      But one consolation for sky-watchers is the appearance of      numerous lunar coronas. The bigger the corona, the smaller      the droplets or ice needles causing it. The more uniform      the size of the droplets or needles (all else being equal),      the more intense and pure the colors. But the pastels of      coronas are beautiful. So is the changeability of      coronas-and the way it often seems to be the Moon      itself that is moving, wading through a sea of surrounding      color.    </p>    <h3>Almanac for October-November 1997</h3>    <p>      <strong>October</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>1</strong> NEW MOON, 12:51 P.M.
