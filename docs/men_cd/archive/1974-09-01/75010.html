                    <p>      <strong>Independence on a 5-Acre Farm</strong>    </p>        <p>      Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Two years ago, when there      were NO currently relevant small-scale-farming introductory      handbooks available, many of us welcomed the publication of      Richard Langer's Grow It! with open arms. Now that we're      all older and more experienced, however, some folks find it      increasingly easy to criticize that breakthrough beginner's      guide (see the <em>Feedback</em> sections of MOTHER NOS.      23, 24 and 25).    </p>    <p>      Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is just      as important (probably more <em>so)</em> now as Grow It!      was two years ago... and which may well come up for its      share of criticism in another 24 months or so.    </p>    <p>      Be that as it may, John and Sally Seymour's record of 18      successful years on a shirttail-sized homestead in England      is important now and should offer welcome encouragement to      today's back-to-the-landers... both real and imaginary. I      started serializing the book in my No. 25 issue and I'm      sure that many readers will want a personal copy for their      home libraries. -MOTHER.    </p>    <h3>      PIG    </h3>    <p>      <em>A couple of flitches of bacon are worth fifty      thousand</em> <em>Methodist sermons and religious      tracts.</em>    </p>    <p>      WILLIAM COBBETT    </p>    <p>      If you have a cow you will ultimately find yourself making      butter, and perhaps cheese, and then you will have skimmed      milk and whey and what are you going to do with these? You      can, in fact, fatten ducks or chickens on milk products,      but the best use to which you can put them is to feed them      to the pigs. Also, your fields and garden will by now be      yielding you much waste that you cannot eat yourself. There      is very little that a pig will not eat. True, you can      compost vegetable waste, but show me a better way of      composting anything than putting it through the guts of a      pig!    </p>    <p>      There are several ways in which you can have pigs. For the      individual or community seriously intent on being      self-supporting the obvious purpose of the job is to have      pigs to kill for meat. There is nothing wrong, though, in      having a surplus to sell, or to trade with other people for      other produce. Other considerations are: the fewer pigs you      have the more completely you will be able to feed them on      the waste products of your farm. A gallon of skimmed milk a      day will go a long way to fattening a pair of baconers, but      spread among a dozen its effect is not so noticeable: in      fact you will have to feed them primarily on other food,      the high protein part of it probably bought in. You are      thus getting further from the idea of being      self-supporting. But, say you only want two pigs, how are      you going to get them? To be truly self-supporting you must      breed them yourself. So you must have at least one sow. Now      she will give you, say, twenty to as many as thirty piglets      in a year (ours always used to give us twenty-four, never      more, never less). You need two pigs to kill for your      family. But of course you can always sell the others as      weaners (that is at eight or ten weeks old, straight off      the sow). But all this forces you to be in pigs in a bigger      way. Then from where do you get the boar? You can't afford      a boar to serve one sow. There are 'boar walkers' though,      who go around carrying a boar in the back of a van, and who      will come when you telephone them, provided you can catch      your sow when she is in heat, which is not always easy. But      this boar problem is a problem. One answer is to have      enough sows to pay the wages, as it were, of a boar. My      belief is that if you have six sows, or even as low as      four, and they pay you really well, you can afford to      support a boar. But again it drives you into a bigger and      bigger commitment in pigs. From a man wanting a couple of      baconers for his family you now become a pig farmer.    </p>    <p>      Of course the whole problem is eased if you are part of a      like-minded community. Either the community can keep the      boar in the centre, as it were, and lend him out to the      communiteers, or else one member of the community can do      all the sow keeping, and swap weaners for other produce. I      say weaners; this is ecologically a sounder method than      that the one pig keeper should fatten the pigs too, and      simply trade pig meat with the other people. The pigs do      better, and more good, and are fed more cheaply, if they      are spread out among everybody.    </p>    <p>      But if you are on your own, and don't want to go into all      the intricacies of sow keeping, you can simply buy a pair      or more of weaners. I will personally have no part in      suggesting to anybody that they should buy <em>one</em>      weaner. I have made the point that the husbandman is a      benevolent ruler and not a tyrant, and a benevolent ruler      does not keep anybody in solitary confinement. But you can      buy weaners, at this day and age, for from five to ten      pounds. My advice is, if you have milk by-products, to buy      the cheapest weaners you can. Normally weaners are sold at      from eight to twelve weeks, and the older they are the      dearer they are likely to cost. But if you have milk you      can buy them very young-and thus get them cheaper.    </p>    <p>      Let us deal with this plan of buying weaners and fattening      them first. The countryman who used to keep a pig at the      bottom of the garden (all too often alone, I fear) used to      show him to you and say: 'I'm only a "growin' " on him now      o' course.' He meant that he was not feeding him a      fattening ration, but just enough food to keep him growing,      in good lean condition. When the time came, in would go the      barley meal and the pig would be fattened. 'That's no good      a "fattenin' " on him twice,' the owner would say. So when      you first get the weaners your should feed them well, with      plenty of milk, until they get over the shock of being      weaned from their mother, and then feed them on a lower      diet, and keep them active and happy, until they are fully      grown. Then you should confine them in a warm place and      simply push the food into them.    </p>    <p>      When I worked on a farm in Gloucestershire, as a boy, we      fattened a hog until it was enormous: twice as big or      bigger than any baconer that is killed today. We turned      this pig into bacon and the bacon was nearly a hundred per      cent fat. There was hardly a streak of lean in it. This      bacon was never fried, but boiled. It was boiled in great      chunks, and every morning the cold chunk of fat was put on      the table for breakfast and we ate slices of it with dry      bread and a boiled egg, and mustard. To have eaten it with      butter would have been revolting, but as it was the stuff      was perfectly delicious, marvellously digestible, and it      kept us working at very hard manual labour, out of doors in      the severest winter England had had for many years, for      many hours a day. This is how pigs used to be eaten.      Cobbett says: `Make him quite fat by all means-the      last bushel does the most good if he sit to eat it.' He      goes on to say that if the pig can walk a hundred yards he      is not fat, and that lean meat is only fit for wasters and      drunkards.    </p>    <p>      Nowadays apparently we have a population of wasters and      drunkards because the only baconers the market will accept      are-like Cassius-lean and hungry pigs-such pigs      are dangerous. The fact is, of course, that people who live      hard and out of doors can relish fat bacon, and it does      them good. We all know the executives' nursery rhyme:    </p>    <p>      <em>Ring a ring a roses<br />      Coronary throm-bo-ses,<br />      A 'seizure!<br />      A 'seizure!<br />      We all fall down!</em>    </p>    <p>      Animal fat only gives seizures and coronary thrombosis to      people who do not get enough exercise. When this nation was      fed on fat bacon and fat beef and mutton the disease was      unknown. Now, as meat gets leaner and leaner until it      nearly fades away, thrombosis is increasing faster than any      other disease except lung cancer. It is idleness that      causes diseases of the heart. True manual workers never get      coronary thrombosis, and nor do self-supporters. But it's      all a matter of taste. I like fat bacon-boiled, mind, not      fried in yet more fat. If you don't, well don't have      it-kill your pigs when they are lean.    </p>    <p>      If you want good fat bacon buy your weaners in the spring      and kill them just before Christmas. At Christmas you      should be eating hams killed the Christmas before; hung a      year they are so much better. And it's nice to have some      fresh pork at Christmas anyway.    </p>    <p>      I do not like to see pigs kept indoors all the time. If you      let confined pigs out of their confinement it is pathetic      to see them snort and gallop and leap about in their      happiness to be free at last. During the last month or two      of fattening a pig keep him indoors by all means, he seems      to get his pleasure then from the thing a pig likes, after      all, to do more than anything else-eating. But until      this fattening stage-when you are 'a "growin' " on      him', let him out. Of course you can't let him run anywhere      or he will do endless damage. And this is where we draw on      the resources of the modern world. The electric fence is      your answer. You can keep pigs in with pig netting, with a      strand of well-strained barbed wire at the bottom, but it's      a running battle. Electric fence is the thing, either two      single strands or the new electric netting which is very      good. If you use single strands and find they don't work      try erecting wire netting behind them, for its      psychological effect. Pigs are tryers. In a world with no      electric fencing I would say, tether your pigs. A rope or      leather harness with one strap in front of the pig's      forelegs and another behind them will do the trick.      Incidentally, if you want a quiet life never try to keep      prick-eared pigs, like the Large White, out of doors. The      flop-eared pig is far more likely to stay behind a fence,      for his ears hang down over his eyes.    </p>    <p>      But while we have electricity let us use it, and part of      your garden thus fenced off, and well pigged, will benefit      enormously. It is the way to bare-fallow land. If you like      you can grow a fodder crop (see Chapter 14) and put the      pigs into that, or you can put the pigs into your potato      patch after you have harvested it (the pigs will find the      last potato) or you can just bare fallow. On a      <em>small</em> enough area the pigs will destroy every      weed, if you leave them there long enough even the horrid      perennial weeds like spear grass or twitch. They will bring      valuable elements up from the subsoil, they will heavily      manure the land, and they will leave it twice as valuable      as it was before. Don't ring them. Let them dig. Don't      expect a couple of pigs to do much good to half an acre      though, concentrate them.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile you have got to feed them something as well as      what they can find for themselves. While they have plenty      of milk (skimmed milk is just as good for them as whole      milk would be) milk mixed into bran or other wheat offal is      all they need. Milk and barley meal are very good too, but      unnecessarily expensive, if you can sell your barley or      have to buy it. In the fattening stage milk and barley meal      is the finest food you can give them. If you can't give      them milk then you will have to buy in some protein. The      easiest thing to do is to give them proprietary cake;      'outdoor pig nuts' are the easiest. They are big and won't      get trodden into the ground easily. Just throw them down at      half the rate recommended on the bag and let the pigs hunt      for them. Or you can buy fish meal and mix it with any kind      of meal at the rate of about ten percent fish meal. Or      twenty percent beans in a mash will give them enough      protein: feed them as much as they can clear up in twenty      minutes and squeal for more.    </p>    <p>      You can give the pigs all your small or misshapen potatoes.      You can often buy 'stock feed' potatoes at very little a      ton, or spoiled carrots (but if these have been washed they      won't keep) or other spoiled food. Kitchen swill is always      fine for pigs. I know a man who buys tons of stale bread      from a bakery and his wife has to spend hours pulling the      wrappers off sliced loaves. (Ugh!) Fodder crops you can      grow specially are fodder beet, carrots, potatoes, kale and      greens of all sorts and, most important on light land      anyway, Jerusalem artichokes. The latter are marvellous;      they grow in the roughest and most weed-infested land,      their foliage smothers everything, and the pigs thrive by      rooting them up. Take the pigs to the artichokes though,      not the artichokes to the pigs. Let the pigs do the work.      Or plant a special pig field, a field you want to 'pig'      anyway, to clean it and fertilize it. Plant, say, a strip      of Jerusalem artichokes, one of fodder beet, one of kale.      Give them a little of all three. Then, when they have      cleared that up, move them on. Variety is the spice of      life.    </p>    <p>      Always keep a pig bucket in the scullery. When we have a      pigless period we don't know what to do. What do we do with      that lovely greasy rich washing-up water? Criminal to throw      it down the sink. What do we do with the celery tops, the      potato peelings, the carrot tops, the waste food? Out in      the garden what do we do with the bean and pea haulms, the      sweet corn tops, the scythed nettles, the pulled-out weeds?      If we have pigs they will either eat it or tread it into      the soil as good compost.    </p>    <p>      As for how much concentrated food to give your pigs, give      them as much as they will clear up quickly. If there is any      left after half an hour give them less next day. Keep them      a little hungry for concentrates.    </p>    <p>      As for housing, if pigs are running out of doors they will      need the minimal, but they will need some. They will need a      dry place and some shelter from the rain. That is all. What      form it takes every man must decide for himself as long as      it is the cheapest and easiest, and the most mobile, for      you will be dragging it around with the pigs. You can      <em>buy</em> Pigloos.    </p>    <p>      Now for sows and pig breeding. I will say very little about      this, only that sows thrive out of doors, provided they are      not overstocked on the same land for too long. At a high      rate of stocking I like to move pigs on to fresh ground at      least once every six weeks, otherwise a worm infestation      builds up and the pigs suffer. Let loose in a wood pigs do      wonders. If you give them two pounds of pig nuts a day when      they are dry that will do them. After they have farrowed      though you must give them from six to eight, depending upon      how much other food they can get and how many piglets they      have. All this business of feeding animals is common sense      really. You can find pages of complicated instructions and      tables and starch equivalents and all the rest of it in the      text books but if you just <em>keep</em> animals, and watch      them carefully, and note whether they are growing or not,      are hungry or not, and use your common sense, you don't      need a whole lot of scientific gobble-degook.    </p>    <p>      As to housing and management of breeding sows, there must      be a shelter-no matter how rough (and it doesn't      matter) but more or less waterproof-available for a      sow, for her sole use, when she farrows. That is all. The      books will tell you to put no litter in a farrowing pen. We      put as much litter in as the sow thinks she needs. Throw      straw or bracken or what have you outside if you like;      before the sow farrows she will carry as much as she needs      in herself in her mouth. We then leave the sows completely      alone. Don't go near them. We have never worried about      farrowing rails (although there's nothing wrong with them)      nor infra red lights, or any of the rest of it. In eight      years at the Broom we kept sows all the time, up to six of      them, and our losses of piglets were as nearly nil as it      was possible for them to be. In eight years I seem to      remember burying two piglets. Once you start to interfere      with nature, with sows, you've got to interfere more and      more. Keep them too confined and they get worms-so      you have to confine them even more, on concrete. Keep them      on concrete and they can't get iron, so you have to inject      the piglets with it or they get anaemia. Farrow them in a      confined space with plenty of straw and they get confused      and smother the piglets.    </p>    <p>      So you give them no straw. They then lose their natural      chain of instinctual actions-nest-making and all the      rest of it-so they lay on, or eat, their piglets.      They are mixed up. So you confine them in a farrowing crate      where they can't move at all and attract the piglets away      from them with a warm infra red light. And the piglets get      virus pneumonia. So you go in for embryotomy. You kill the      sow and take the piglets out of her belly in aseptic      conditions and bring them up in sterile boxes. This is      actually being done on a large scale in America and more      and more in England. Pigs are now being kept, all their      lives, in total darkness except when they are fed, and in      tiny wire cages like battery hens. Where do you go from      there?    </p>    <p>      Right back, I should say, to keeping sows under the most      natural conditions possible, allowing their proper chain of      instincts to work itself out. We used to get a pound a head      more for our piglets than other weaner producers because      the fatteners knew they would never get virus pneumonia.      They had spent their lives running about in the open air,      and getting what minerals they wanted straight from the      soil, and they were as tough and hardy as wild boars.    </p>    <h3>      BACON    </h3>    <p>      <em>Meat in the house is a great source of harmony.</em>    </p>    <p>      WILLIAM COBBETT    </p>    <h3>      SLAUGHTERING    </h3>    <p>      In most parts of Britain at least there is a public      slaughterhouse somewhere in the vicinity; although these      get fewer and fewer and further and further as the great      philosophy of the twentieth century-Bigger Means Better-has      its sway. Where at one time a bullock was quietly walked a      mile or two to the village slaughterhouse, rested in the      butcher's paddock for the night, and knocked on the head      next morning, now he is crammed into the back of a huge      cattle truck with thirty others, banged and lurched,      terrified, over up to a hundred miles of roads, forced      bellowing into a blood-reeking meat factory and eventually      slaughtered. All in the sacred name of Progress.    </p>    <p>      However, if there is a slaughterhouse not too far away you      can send your pig, or pigs, there and have them slaughtered      for a fee. You have to get them in there though, pay for      the job to be done, and go and fetch the meat back again.      You make, in other words, four journeys. It is therefore      very much better, if you can, to slaughter them yourself.    </p>    <p>      In most real country districts there is at least one man      who will kill you a pig for a small fee. He makes it part      of his living. Or perhaps there is a friendly village      butcher who will do it for you. If you can entertain such a      man with friendship and home brewed beer he will do it the      more willingly, and be the more likely to come and do it      again. Pig killing may seem to the townsman to be a brutal      and grisly business, but in fact the occasion can have a      kind of boozey, bucolic charm.    </p>    <p>      I kill my pigs with a .22 rifle which I claim is the most      humane method there could be. I have killed three pigs a      year for sixteen years and only once (when I first began)      did I have to use a second shot. I lure the pig quietly out      of his sty into the cow shed with a little food in a bucket      (he has had no supper the night before) and put the food      into a dish. As the pig starts to eat the food I shoot him      in the brain. Anywhere in the head will stun him actually,      but I always shoot him in the brain. Draw a line with your      imagination from his left ear-hole to his right eye, and      from his other ear-hole to his other eye, and where the two      lines cross, shoot him. You could not shoot him thus with a      humane killer because he would not stand still for you. As      soon as you put the humane killer near his head he would      move away. Therefore if you use a humane killer you will      have to <em>rope</em> your pig (getting a slipping noose in      his mouth and round his snout) and he will squeal and      struggle, and his last moments will be violent and unhappy      and not perfectly peaceful as they should be. The .22 is by      far the kindest way to kill a pig. One moment he is happily      eating-the next moment he is in Heaven.    </p>    <p>      <em>lmmedlately you</em> have shot him stick him in the      front of the neck. The place to stick seems easy to see in      practice. Suffice to say that you should use a shortish      knife (6 inches is long enough), stick it two inches in      front of his breastbone at an angle of 45 degrees from the      horizontal line of the pig and <em>keep it dead central.      You</em> can easily feel the breastbone if you are in      doubt, then remember, insert the knife two inches in front      of it and at an angle of 45 degrees up towards the back of      the pig. Thus will you cut both the carotid arteries and      the jugular vein. Two things will happen. One is that blood      will gush out in great quantity and now is the time for      your wife to be at hand to catch it in a basin if she wants      to make black pudding and has a stronger stomach than most      people's wives (our blood goes down the drain I am afraid),      and, secondly, the pig will begin to kick as though it is      trying to win the Grand National. Let it kick, and remember      it can feel nothing-its soul is in Heaven playing a      porcine harp. If your wife has caught the blood,      incidentally, she must stir it or whip it immediately      otherwise it will clot.    </p>    <p>      We thereupon haul out pig up on a tackle, to make sure that      all the blood drains out. Most people don't bother.    </p>    <h3>      SCALDING AND DISSECTING    </h3>    <p>      Some people drop their pig into a huge half tub containing      scalding water. We used to but now do not. We went through      a phase of pouring methylated spirits over the pig and      lighting it and letting it burn like a Christmas pudding      but have given that up too. Now we do what all the local      Pembrokeshire people do around here, we let the pig lie on      the concrete floor and pour the scalding water over the      pig. The object of this is so that you can scrape the      bristles off the pig. Now great skill is needed for this,      and this is one of the arts that you had better learn from      your local expert.    </p>    <p>      The water must be from 145° to 150° F (63° to      66° C) and no more. If it is too cold it won't get the      bristles out; if it is too hot it will 'fix' them and      you'll never get them out. The local wise man will know      whether the water is right by looking into it (as a brewer      does). If he can see his face in it it is right. Or he will      put one part of cold water into three parts of boiling      water. That is as good. You must have plenty of hot water      ready-ten gallons is not too much.    </p>    <p>      Pour some of the scalding water over part of the      pig-slowly-then keep plucking at the bristles.      Suddenly they will come out easily in your fingers. Now is      the time to start scraping. Don't scrape with a knife, the      lid of a tin is ideal, or a tin coffee-pot lid. Don't cut      the skin. Just scrape until the bristles come out and if      the pig started off by being a black pig, it will end up as      a white pig. Colour, in pigs as in humans, is not even skin      deep. Meanwhile your wife/mistress/home-brew-drinking      neighbour is busy pouring more water on a different place.      Scrape away. Put each trotter right into a jug of scalding      water, pull it out, scrape it, and yank the horny hoof off      with a pair of pincers or a hook. In a very short time the      pig will be clean. Do his head too-every part of him.      Suffer not a bristle to remain and mar his beauty. Besides      hot water you need plenty of home brew to go with this      operation.    </p>    <p>      Now 'hock' your pig, or ham string him, that is cut behind      the tendons (gam strings) at the back of his hind legs just      above the hoof. A glance at a pig carcase in a butcher's      shop will show you how to do this. This tendon, although      slender, is amazingly strong. Put the ends of a gamble      through these tendons. A gamble is a spreader: a metal or      wooden stick, maybe fifteen inches long, hung from its      middle by a block tackle, and with flattened out and      curving ends for hanging a pig on. See them also in any      butcher's shop. Now split the breastbone of the pig with      knife and chopper. Do this immediately. Haul the pig off      the ground with the tackle.    </p>    <p>      We always cut the head off at this juncture. I think it      simplifies things to do so. Some people leave the head on      and split it when they split the pig, but you cannot do      this until next day. We cut the head off at the first      vertebra and put it where no flies can get to it (but      normally we kill pigs in the winter when there are no      flies, and I do not recommend killing them in the summer      anyway) and now we gut it. This takes skill, and common      sense. Get on a chair behind the pig and encircle its anus      with the point of the knife. You do this so that the bowel      will drop out when you get the guts out and not tear,      leaving the anus behind where you don't want it and      spilling excrement all over the place. You very carefully      cut the actual anus, or arse-hole, of the pig right round      so as to separate it from the rest of the pig. Before you      cut the last bit you grab it with one hand, cut it away      completely, haul the bowel out a few inches and get a      friend (it seems a little indelicate to ask your wife) to      tie a piece of string round it. This is, as I hope you have      guessed, to stop any excrement coming out of it. Now you      let it go and the weight of the rest of the bowels pulls it      down inside the pig.    </p>    <p>      This grisly business over you get down, and round to the      belly of your pig, and you very carefully insert just the      point of your knife in the middle of the belly just about      where our solar plexus would be. Only let the knife      <em>just</em> cut through the skin-you are not Jack      the Ripper. Then insert your forefinger in along the back      of the knife and move the knife upwards (i.e., towards the      tail of the pig) with your forefinger acting as a guard to      prevent that unforgivable happening: shoving the knife      point into the paunch or guts and thus fouling your meat.      Cut right up to where the two hind legs join. Dissect out      the penis and urethra and bladder if a male pig, and      bladder if a female. Now as you open the belly the paunch      and guts will try to get out. You now see why you were told      to split the breastbone while the pig was on the ground: if      you had not done so the guts would be hanging down out of      the pig and you wouldn't have been able to.    </p>    <p>      Let the guts flop out into a tin bath.    </p>    <p>      Carefully remove the <em>pluck</em> . This is the liver,      heart and lungs, with a few oddments, all hung together on      the windpipe or trachea. Cut the gall bladder out, very      carefully so as not to splash gall over anything at all,      and throw it away. Stick a hook through the windpipe and      hang the pluck up in a flyproof place.    </p>    <p>      We always chuck a couple of buckets of cold water into the      eviscerated pig to wash the blood out of it. Some experts      might tell you that this is not a good idea. I think it is      though.    </p>    <p>      Then go and finish the rest of the home brew. You deserve      every drop of it, you and your companions. About the only      part of the pig that is fit to eat for supper that night is      the liver.    </p>    <p>      Next morning go back to your pig. He has been hanging up      all night, we hope, in a nice cold draught, where neither      rat nor cat can get at him. Cut a score down his back,      through all that back fat, from his tail to where his head      used to be, right along the central line. You can feel this      for part of the way with the finger, but much. depends on a      good eye and judgment. Next take a light sharp      chopper-not one of your vast axes such as beheaded      Mary Queen of Scots-and chop the backbone right down      the middle. Split your pig right in half. Now obviously      when you pull one half of that pig off the gamble the      latter will tip up and deposit the other half on the floor.      You must allow for this either by tying the other half up,      or getting somebody stronger than your poor wife to take it      off while you take your half off. And half a large baconer      is very heavy indeed let me tell you.    </p>    <p>      Lay your half on the table and cut it into suitable joints      for curing. Our plan is to lay the side skin-side down, put      the knife in under the tail (or where the tail should be)      and with the blade slanting towards the head end of the pig      cut a good generous curve until you hit bone. Then start at      the belly side of the pig and do the other half of the      proposed generous circle until you hit the bone again. Then      a few strokes of the meat saw (or any old saw) will cut      through the bone and complete the job. Like this, as you      started <em>under</em> the tail, you miss the spine of      course. You now have what looks very much like a ham. Cut      the trotter off but <em>below</em> the first joint, so that      you have plenty of leg to hang the ham up by.    </p>    <p>      Cut the pig straight across, at right angles to its back,      about nine inches from the tail (at the point at which the      spine suddenly curves upwards). This odd bit of meat, which      is good, we use as a roasting joint in due course. It is an      awkward shape for salting though.    </p>    <p>      Now inside the side of the pig is the belly fat, which      makes the finest lard, and this we rip out. All fat is cut      into little pieces and put into a big crock, with a little      water, and put into the slow oven. Do not overheat it as it      will burn. From time to time pull it out of the slow oven      and pour the liquid fat off it, and put it into basins; but      more of that anon.    </p>    <p>      Now pull the kidney out, and then carefully cut out the      tenderloin: that strip of lean meat inside the carcase near      the kidney. This should be baked in due course draped with      the caul of the beast: that thin membrane with dollops of      fat all over it on which the small intestines were hung.      With onions it is quite delicious.    </p>    <p>      Separate the forequarter from the side. To do this cut      right across the carcase between the 4th and 5th ribs, just      behind the shoulder blade.    </p>    <p>      You will now have a ham, a forequarter and a side. The side      is a big one. Maybe you will prefer, for ease of handling,      to split it right down the middle, sawing through the ribs,      so as to leave a back and a belly. The belly will be poor      tack: a thinnish sheet and mostly fat. We used to roll this      and put it in a wet pickle, but it is good for sausages.      You can dry salt it, only don't leave it in the salt for      more than a week. You also have a couple of good roasting      joints from where the loin was. You can cut the forequarter      into joints and roast it too if you like, or you can salt      it like the ham. First cut the blade bone off if you like,      and use that fresh as a joint.    </p>    <h3>      CURING    </h3>    <p>      There are scores of methods of curing ham and bacon, but I      will give you the simplest and most widespread, in England      and Wales at least. I will just describe what we do, and      what most of my neighbours do (or such as still cure their      own bacon).    </p>    <p>      We have a big slate salting bench. We dump some dry salt on      this (you will need at least forty pounds of salt to do a      pig in comfort. If you wish to be more economical with salt      you will have to be a lot more careful and take a lot more      trouble. We just use a lot of salt and bury the pig in it).      Lay a ham on the salt. Sprinkle as much saltpetre as you      can hold between your finger and thumb on the cut end of      the ham. Take a handful of soft brown sugar and shove that      on the cut end of the ham. Rub it, and the saltpetre with      it, in hard. Then rub salt in, and rub in hard. Then treat      the skin-covered part of the ham the same. Now I know that      all the books tell you to weigh the saltpetre, and mix it      thoroughly with the salt, etc., but once you have to start      messing about weighing dribs and drabs of this and that the      meat will go bad while you are fussing. The method I have      described has worked for perhaps a hundred hams with me and      they have all been excellent. Bury the ham in salt. Do the      same with all the other joints. Add enough saltpetre just      for the merest sprinkling. The saltpetre is supposed to      preserve the colour of the meat. I have a shrewd suspicion      that if you didn't use it at all the ham would be just as      good but I don't know. You needn't use sugar, but most      people do, particularly for the hams. It makes them      sweeter. Squeeze the hams hard and a gout of blood will      come out from a certain vein. See how much of this you can      squeeze out.    </p>    <p>      Then every day, for three days, take the joints out and rub      them hard with salt. See that they get dry salt in contact      with them all over, and put them back again, probably      upside down. After three days just leave them be in the      salt. Take the bellies out in a week, the sides out in a      fortnight, the forequarters out in a fortnight to three      weeks depending on how big they are, and the hams out in      three weeks to a month (three weeks if they are just      ordinary sized hams). Rinse the salt off them and hang them      up in an even temperature somewhere and let them dry off      for a week or two. We hang ours straight in the <em>simnai      fawr.</em> The <em>simnai fawr</em> is the big chimney over      our fireplace open to the sky. There is a bend in this      chimney so part of it is not exposed to the rain, and there      are pipes up there as a rack. I hang the meat up there,      high above the fire, where it gets the smoke and does not      get too hot. It must not get too hot, or the fat goes      rancid. It wants to be a good ten feet above the fire. If      you haven't got a <em>simnai fawr</em> you can build a      smoke-house, and this I will describe in a later      installment. Smoke for a week or a fortnight, depending how      often you have the fire alight, and then take down and      store. Smoking preserves meat and gives it a fine flavour      but it is not necessary. Plenty of people around here don't      smoke.    </p>    <p>      We store ours by just hanging it up. Many people bandage      their hams and hang them up or, better still I believe,      wrap them well and store them down in a chest buried in dry      ashes, or dry bran or oats, but you must watch for mice or      mites with the latter. This prevents the hams from drying      out. If hung it should be hung in the dark, and in fresh      air.    </p>    <p>      When you need a bit of bacon, cut a big slice off one of      the sides, bone it (troublesome-but watch a grocer do      it one day), and slice it as you need it. But it is saltier      than shop bacon (which is not meant to keep) so soak the      slices in fresh water for up to half an hour before frying      it. If you wish to boil a lump of it soak it for twelve      hours first.    </p>    <p>      Keep the hams, if you can, a full year. Scrub well, soak      all night, put in water with plenty of pepper and simmer      (not boil) for 25 minutes for every pound of ham. Let it      cool in its own liquor. Eat cold.    </p>    <p>      There are plenty of sweet pickles for hams. These generally      involve plunging the fresh ham into a brine made with such      things as beer or cider mixed with treacle, sugar, spices      and salt. Keep turning it in the pickle for, say, a month.      Here is a typical cure, such as one of our Suffolk      neighbours used to recommend:    </p>    <p>      1 qt. old ale<br />      1 lb. brown sugar<br />      2 lbs. salt<br />      1 oz. peppercorns<br />      1 qt. malt vinegar<br />      3/4 oz. saltpetre<br />      1 oz. cloves    </p>    <p>      Boil it all together, cool it, soak the ham in it for a      month. I tried this but found I needed a lot more pickle.      The ham was very good though.    </p>    <p>      Curing bacon and ham is much simpler than people think, and      if you follow the above simple instructions for the      ordinary dry cure you will have no trouble and not go      wrong. (But don't blame me if you do-and don't try it      in the summer!)    </p>    <p>      Now what has your faithful wife been doing while all this      has been going on?    </p>    <p>      Why, the very first day she has taken the stomach and large      intestine, hereinafter called the <em>chitlings,</em> down      to a clean brook if she has one, or in the sink if she      hasn't, opened them and carefully washed the excrement out      of them. She has then cut the large intestine into six-inch      lengths (if she doesn't want it for sausage), put it and      the stomach, also cut up, into a clean bowl, taken them      back to the house, scalded with boiling water, washed in      cold water, and then filled the bowl with brine. She      changes and charges the brine every day for a few days,      then she boils the stuff for two hours, lets it cool, and      fries it with onions . . . it is perfectly delicious.    </p>    <p>      Another fate waits the small intestines, and maybe the      large too. These, as soon as the pig is killed or at least      the next day, are separated from the fat that clings to      them and unravelled. One end is put on the cold tap and the      tap turned on, whereupon they writhe about like a snake,      but eventually all the excrement is washed out of them.      They are then turned inside out on a smooth stick, which is      easier than it sounds. They are then laid flat on a board      and scraped with the back of a knife. This gets the gut      lining off them. They are then coiled down tight in dry      salt and put away until they are needed as sausage casings.    </p>    <p>      The bladder is washed out well. A small funnel can be poked      into it and hot lard poured in. The lard cools and the      thing is hung up as a storage vessel for lard. As for the      rest of the fat, as the days go by you will render out more      and more beautiful white lard which you can pour into      sterilized jars or bottles, cover well, when it will keep      for some time. If you have a deep freeze put some of it in      that to keep longest. You will have free cooking fat for a      very long time indeed.    </p>    <p>      Now for that grisly <em>memento mori,</em> the head. As      soon as you have time, that first day, shove it in a big      crock and fill it with brine. Let it soak for two or three      days or more until you have some leisure. Then the bath      chaps (which are the cheeks) can be cut off separately and      hung in the smoke and cured. They are very delicious boiled      and eaten cold with plenty of mustard. Whether you do this      or not shove the head, with or without its cheeks, in a      large boiler together with the trotters and any other      gristly bits and simmer for four hours or so. Pull it all      out and take all the meat off the bones. Cut the meat up      small (you can mince it if you like), mince six large      onions, put plenty of pepper and other spices on the meat      (the more the merrier in my opinion), skim the fat off the      soup that you boiled the meat in, put the meat back into      the soup and simmer for two hours, or until the liquor is      reduced to what common sense tells you it ought to be. Pour      the stuff hot into basins and let cool. You now have a      delicious brawn, which will keep for a month or more in a      cold winter, and for ever if you bag it and put it in the      deep freeze. Or you can pour it boiling into kilner jars,      boil the jars for 20 minutes, and seal.    </p>    <h3>      SAUSAGES    </h3>    <p>      English and Welsh home-cured bacon and ham is as good as      any in the world, but there is one thing that the British      have never cottoned on to, and that is the Continental-type      sausage. The whole idea of this is that it is a      way-and a delicious way-of preserving meat. Our      English sausages are fine to eat fresh, or to keep in the      deep freeze, but it is an enormous advantage to be able to      make a big glut of meat into sausages that can be hung up      from the ceiling, and left for months, and one hauled down      whenever you feel like it, and sliced and eaten raw. If you      have bread and butter and that kind of sausage you always      have a sumptuous meal waiting ready for you.    </p>    <p>      We have tried dried sausage (if one can call such a      delicious thing by such a pedestrian name) with casings      from the small intestine of the pig, and these are fair      enough but are too small to keep moist for very long or to      provide conditions necessary for producing that succulent      thing, a true, smoked, spicy and garlicky Continental      sausage. To make such a thing you need the large intestine      of the ox, if you can get it, or the sheep if you can't, or      large intestine of the pig, which you must treat in the      same way as I have described for treating the small      intestine above. You want to produce a sausage as thick as      your wrist.    </p>    <p>      There are a hundred different recipes for producing what I      must call, for want of a better word, Continental sausage.      Some of them are contained in a very useful book:      <em>Charcuterie and French Pork Cooking</em> by Jane      Grigson (Michael Joseph). All such recipes call for an      ounce of this and half an ounce of that and it all sounds      terribly complicated, and of course by making small      adjustments in the ingredients you can make small      differences to your resulting sausage; but the principles      of the thing are simple enough, and if you keep the      principles in mind you can make what sort of sausages you      like, and very good they will be too.    </p>    <p>      You need some lean meat and some fat. The lean of course      will be from the 'cheapest' cuts of your pig. You can put      beef in too if you like. We used to use one part lean pork,      one part lean beef and one part belly fat of pork. Two      parts of lean pork and one part of fat are a good mixture.      Bacon fat will do too.    </p>    <p>      For every three pounds of lean-and-fat you need:    </p>    <p>      1 oz. salt<br />      2 tsp. of pepper<br />      2 or 3 cloves of garlic<br />      As much spice of whatever sort you have<br />      Some people like 1 Tbs. of brown sugar<br />      If you haven't marinated the meat in wine a glassful of any      kind of wine is useful, or liquer.<br />      A big pinch of saltpetre    </p>    <p>      Mince the lean meat and cut the fat into small dices (it is      the latter which gives the cut sausage that white-speckled      appearance). We have always marinated the lean meat for      twelve hours in elderberry wine and it works very well. You      should really, of course, use grape wine. Or you don't need      to marinate at all. Try both.    </p>    <p>      Whether or not you marinate mix the whole lot up together      and stuff it all, raw as it is, into your casing. Tie the      long casing off into sausages of the length you fancy, hang      up in a warm dry place-this is important-not      warmer than 70° F (21° C). A steady 60° F is      what you should aim at. If you have an Aga that never goes      out nearby that is ideal. Now if you have a big open      chimney, or any other kind of smoking device, hang the      sausages up in it after say a week of drying and smoke them      for a day and a night. Take them down and hang them in a      well-aired dry place and forget them for six months. They      will grow a white mould over them. Hooray. Give them at      least six months (if you can wait) to mature. Eat them raw.    </p>    <p>      But the meat will shrink a lot, and if you use large      casings you will have to squeeze the meat down hard into      one end of the casing once or twice during the drying to      keep it tight. Then tie the skin off to keep it tight. It      is a good thing also, with big sausages, to tie them round      with string like Malvolio's cross garters, and to tighten      the strings from time to time to keep the sausage      compressed. I have seen fine sausages made like this using      the pig's bladder, and I think this would be a very good      use for the bladder, rather than filling it with lard or      blowing it up like a balloon and giving it to the children      to clown about with.    </p>    <p>      If you don't like so much fat don't use so much. If you      don't like garlic don't use it. The casing is important:      you can't use plastic, for the reason that it cannot      breathe and the meat could not dry out. Bacterial action of      a benign sort takes place within the sausages also and that      needs the controlled transpiration that natural animal      membrane can give. Remember-nothing is cooked. It is all      raw. It may seem an insuperable obstacle that you have got      to find animal large intestines, but if you go to any      slaughterhouse they will give you guts galore, and all you      have to do, remember, is turn the guts inside out, scrape      the lining off with the back of a knife, wash well, and      pack down in dry salt until you need them. Pack down close      and away from air.    </p>    <p>      Our getting a deep freeze, and a bigger farm, put paid to      our Continental sausage-making activities. It is so much      quicker to shove everything into the deep freeze. But then:      is nothing to touch well spiced and smoked and well matured      tured Continental sausage: it is perhaps the most delicious      food there is. And next time you see some in a shop just      inquire the price of it per <em>ounce-let alone</em> per      pound! And it is very easy to make after all; the biggest      trouble is mincing the stuff and for that you must have a      good mincing machine. Kenwood has a mincer plus      sausage-filling attachment.    </p>    <h3>      FRESH PORK    </h3>    <p>      Your true porker is a much smaller pig than your baconer. A      baconer can be nearly a year old, a porker say four months.      If you have a deep freeze, to kill a porker is all very      well (you do it in exactly the same way as you do a      baconer), or also if you make Continental sausages. But it      is better to take your pigs on to bacon weight and then get      what pork you want out of them before baconing or making      sausages of the rest. Pork, like all other meat except      offal, should be hung in a cool draughty place for several      days before either cooking, or putting in the deep freeze.    </p>    <p>      <em>But about this time it is more than possible that      the</em> <em>Methodist parson will pay you a visit. It is      remarked in</em> <em>America that these gentlemen<br />      are attracted by the squeaking of pigs, as the fox is by      the cackling of the hen.</em>    </p>    <p>      WILLIAM COBBETT: Cottage Economy    </p>
