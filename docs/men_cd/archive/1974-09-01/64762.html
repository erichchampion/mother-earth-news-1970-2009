                    <p>      <em>Poppy George" Plitt graduated from college with a      degree in agriculture in 1932. During the years that      followed he made a good many friends and a name for himself      (as a gentleman, inventor and executive) in the field of      bird and animal husbandry and care. At v</em> <em>arious      points in his career, Mr. Plitt served as Director of      Nutritional Research and Field Services for two of the      East's larger grain mills. He is also the originator of      Pride of the Valley Wild Bird Food and Kleen Kitty cat      litter. Mr. Plitt now raises and trains standardbred horses      and keeps a wide variety of other birds and animals on a      New York farm.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Poppy George" is now sharing his experience by giving      MOTHER's readers down-to-earth advice on the care and      feeding of homestead livestock. Questions should be mailed      to Mr. George Plitt, Happiness Hills Farms, RD 3, Addison,      N. Y. 14801.</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      QUESTION: I have one milking cow, and I'm told I should dry      her off two months before she's due to calve again. That      will leave me with no source of milk until she gives birth,      since my two immature goats aren't producing yet. Any      suggestions, Poppy?    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: Years ago, I spent a while aboard freighters and      the officers were always served fresh milk early in the      voyage. On one trip, though, we were away several weeks      before reaching our next port of call and . . . we still      had fresh, sweet milk. A check with the cook revealed that      he had taken aboard a large supply in the usual paper      containers, and frozen it. Then he'd removed the stock from      the freezer as needed, and, believe it or not, it always      tasted good. Maybe you can use this method to put by some      of your cow's present yield.    </p>    <p>      In the future, I'd recommend timing the breeding of one or      both milk goats so they'll freshen when the cow is due to      be dried off.    </p>    <p>      QUESTION: I buy a few bags of feed in 100-pound lots and I      dread the ordeal of opening them stitch by stitch (or else      cutting the material). Isn't there any other way to do it?    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: Don't feel bad if you have problems opening sewed      burlap, plastic or paper bags. I know several hundred      farmers who still don't know the way to do this simply and      properly.    </p>    <p>      Here's how: Look for a couple of seconds at both sides of      the bag's top. You'll notice that the line of sewing      consists of a single stitch on one side and a link stitch      on the other. Take a knife (or, better still, a 10-penny      nail), stand with the plain seam to your right-if      you're right-handedand slip the tool's point under the      first stitch at the beginning of the row to break the      thread. Then pull the two strings, one from each side, and      they'll open all the way across with little effort. (You      may have to break two <em>c.</em> three stitches at the      start, but once you get the process going you'll be amazed      at its ease.)    </p>    <p>      QUESTION: Any suggestions on how to control plant pests      without chemicals? My tomatoes and roses need help.    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: Plant basil with your tomatoes and chives with your      roses. They discourage insects, improve growth and give you      herbs to use, too.    </p>    <p>      QUESTION: Before I became a Mother Earther and got my patch      of land, I was a bookkeeper . . . so I keep trying to be      efficient, or at least I keep thinking about it. This year      I set two hens, one of which hatched out nine baby chicks      and the other ten. I'm satisfied with the results but would      like to know the "professional" way to go about the job.    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: Math was my poorest subject and I'm no efficiency      expert, but I always tried to set two hens at the same time      with 15 eggs under each. (I checked the birds first to be      sure they were free of lice.) Then the broods would hatch      simultaneously, and I'd put all the chicks under one mother      . . . since a single hen can easily take care of 25 or more      babies. The other gal then would be confined in a coop with      a wire floor to distract her from her motherly urges and      get her back into an egg-laying mood.    </p>    <p>      QUESTION: I have a few sheep and their four-month-old      lambs. Should the flock be separated now?    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: Yes, the lambs should be docked and put in separate      pasture. Divide their field into two units, leave them in      the first for a couple of weeks and then move then into the      adjoining lot and then back into the original half. This      rotation gives you more mileage from the grass and cuts      down on the possibility of the lambs becoming infested with      parasitic worms.    </p>    <p>      QUESTION: How should I make my chicken coop ready for      winter?    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: [1] Get some motor oil drainings (free at most      service stations), add some kerosene and paint all walls;      floors, cracks and crevices with the mixture. Apply it      liberally to preserve the wood and help keep lice and mites      out of crannies.    </p>    <p>      [2] Get empty cardboard cartons-the kind which hold      paper towels, if possible-and staple or nail them to      the ceiling inside the structure for insulation.    </p>    <p>      [3] Accumulate plastic sheeting and nail it over the      windows of the coop.    </p>    <p>      These precautions should put the shelter into good enough      shape to keep your chickens comfortable and laying this      winter.    </p>
