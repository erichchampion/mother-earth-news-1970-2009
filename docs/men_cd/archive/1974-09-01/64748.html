                       <h5 id="byline">    by DOROTHY MILNER    </h5>     <p>      I just finished reading all the back issues of      MOTHER-it took a couple of months but I certainly did      enjoy them-and I don't remember seeing a recipe for      fruit leather. Thought you might like one.    </p>    <p>      The leather is lightweight, chewy and sweet, a good candy      substitute. It would be fine for trips (journeys), for      backpacking or just for a snack. You can make it of almost      any fruit. I've used pear, apple, prune and plum and want      to try banana, cherry, apricot, blackberry and strawberry      in the future.    </p>    <p>      I wash, core or pit my home-grown fruit and make it into a      sauce in the blender (with just enough water added to keep      the pulp from burning). You can spice the puree if you want      . . . apple butter flavoring is good.    </p>    <p>      Spread the pulp on a greased baking sheet, set the oven at      150Â° or as low as it will go and put the pan in with      the oven door propped open. Leave it there several hours or      until the fruit is tacky to the touch. Then turn the mass      over and bake it some more until the second side is also      tacky. Let the sheet stand overnight on a cake rack so that      the fruit can dry out even more. (In a hot climate like      Arizona's, you can dehydrate the sauce outdoors in the      sun.)    </p>    <p>      Next morning, dust the leather on both sides with      cornstarch. Tear off a sheet of wax paper a little bigger      than the layer of fruit and roll both up together. Tuck in      the ends of paper, fasten them with masking tape and date      the package. Store the rolls in gallon jars (the kind cafes      get their salad dressing in).    </p>    <p>      Leather will last a long time . . . <em>if</em> you      misplace the container, as I did once. The fruit was still      perfectly good when I found it three years later. Didn't      stay around long after that, though.    </p>    <p>      My daughter made apple juice the other day and used the      apple pulp to make leather . . . a good idea, I thought. I      have a Saftborn juicer that <em>steams</em> the liquid out      of fruit. The result doesn't have to be frozen, as raw      juice does. I just bottle it in recycled beer bottles, cap      it and set it on the shelf.    </p>    <p>      Oh, yes. .. I also want to give you a recipe for sauerkraut      I found in an 1850 cookbook:    </p>    <p>      Wash and drain cabbage, and shred it to fill jars almost to      the top. <em>Don't</em> <em>pack too tightly.</em> Work out      the air with a silver knife. Place one teaspoon      <em>each</em> of white sugar, table salt, chopped onion and      dill on top of each jar. Fill the containers to the brim      with boiling water, screw on the tops tightly and turn the      jars upside down to make sure no air bubbles are present.      Let the cabbage stand six weeks before use.    </p>    <p>      This is called "Pickled Cabbage", really. It's not as      "krauty" as sauerkraut. Esther Dickey says in her book,      <em>Passport to Survival</em> that corn, peas, shelled lima      beans, carrots, cauliflower, beets, turnips, etc., can also      be preserved this way. I haven't tried them, but the      cabbage sure is good.    </p>    <p>      Well, I guess I've taken enough of your time . . . although      I'd appreciate a design for a wood splitter-      <em>not</em> an axe-which a woman could use. Sure do      enjoy the good info in MOTHER. I've thought for a long time      that these ole-timey things should be put down and not      lost.    </p>    <p>      <em>Thanks, Dorothy,</em> <em>It's time I ran another      article on fruit leather (since canning jars are getting      so-scarce). However, if you'll check my No. 5 issue, you'll      find instructions for air and sun drying persimmon pulp      into leather. You'll also find other drying, home canning      and root cellar preservation ideas in a long piece in      MOTHER NO. 10.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And hey! I believe that Garden Way Publishing Co.,      Charlotte, Vermont 05445 sells plans for a homemade log      splitter. -MOTHER.</em>    </p>
