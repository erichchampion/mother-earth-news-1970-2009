                    <h5 id="byline">     by CHARLES F. JENKINS    </h5>          <p>      Almost every non-vegetarian homesteader dreams of fresh      meat, eggs and milk from his own place . . . but may be      rudely awakened when he counts the initial cost of all the      livestock he hopes to keep. Fortunately, there <em>are</em>      ways to stock your land with healthy animals at little      expense . . . or do without them entirely.    </p>    <p>      If you're beginning a small flock of poultry, for instance.      you might check with a nearby hatchery for discards. Such a      business has days when orders are exceeded by the number of      newly hatched birds . . . and if no facilities are      available to keep the surplus chicks, they're destroyed and      dumped into the garbage can. (This is done only as a last      resort, since the owner has an investment in labor, eggs,      incubators and heat used for hatching.)    </p>    <p>      If you buy chicks in the usual way, remember that almost      all hatcheries sell them by sex and that pullets are much      more expensive. Cockerels, however, are cheap . . . and,      since sexing chicks isn't an exact science, every lot of      100 supposed males will contain a few females. If you don't      like those odds, "straight run" chicks-in theory,      half pullets and half cockerels-are usually priced at      about half the going rate for sexed pullets.    </p>    <p>      It's not necessary to buy a year's supply of chicks at      once. You can start with a dozen or two and begin another      miniflock several weeks later. Just be sure the birds will      be feathered out before snow falls.    </p>    <p>      Here's another approach to stocking the poultry yard: A      neighbor who keeps any of the heavy breeds of chickens may      sell-or, in some cases, <em>give-you</em> a      "clucking hen". (A heavy breed is suggested for this      purpose because lighter fowl such as leghorns are great on      laying but are generally very indifferent mothers.)    </p>    <p>      A clucking hen is a gal who wants to set on a batch of eggs      and makes quite a pest of herself telling everyone about      it. If you get one of these biddies, get some eggs too . .      . by providing a gentleman to run around the barnyard with      the ladies. This is an easy way to start a dozen or more      chicks, since the hen does most of the work.    </p>    <p>      In the meantime, while you wait for your pullets to start      production, you may be able to buy eggs from a      neighbor-a dozen or two at a time-at 25% or so      below retail prices.    </p>    <p>      Other livestock can also be come by at little cost. For      example, goat farmers often destroy baby billies shortly      after the mother's milk flow picks up. One or two male kids      obtained free or for a nominal sum will soon grow into an      excellent meat supply.    </p>    <p>      A weaned pig-or preferably two-can be had at      varying prices dependent upon the market and the size of      the animal . . . and in six months or less, each will gorge      himself into 200 pounds of pork. Watch the classified ads      in the local papers. If you're offered males, be sure      they've been castrated (or be prepared to have it done).      Old-timers declare that there's a decided difference in      flavor between boar and barrow meat. <em>(They're      right!-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      You can often start a flock of sheep by searching for      disowned lambs. Many owners won't bother with a baby which      is rejected by its mother and will gladly sell it for a      small price or even give it away. You'll pay a price in      labor and patience while the little creature is bottle fed,      but-once on grass-it's a 24-hour-a-day lamb      chop and wool factory.    </p>    <p>      If you want to raise a calf for beef, you can make a      private treaty with a farmer or visit a weekly stock sale      in your area. In a dozen years of experience and      observation, however, I've found no quick way to turn such      a purchase into meat. Your animal will take a year to a      year and a half to reach slaughter size . . . and then      you'll have the problem of butchering a 1,000-pound steer      or getting it done for you. Here in Ohio, do-gooders have      pushed through laws under which very few custom butchers      can operate, and this service is hard to find.    </p>    <p>      We've decided that it's more satisfactory for us to buy a      hindquarter of beef through classified ads or through      inquiry. If we needed a whole carcass and had storage      facilities for it, however, I'd follow the advice of a      lifelong farmer friend. He much prefers to buy a seven- or      eight-year-old cow, confine and feed the animal grain for      about two months and then butcher her. In his opinion, such      a critter supplies far better steaks and roasts than any      18-month-old steer. (In addition, an aged cow is unlikely      to have received hormone treatments or other dangerous      drugs usually given commercial feedlot animals.)    </p>    <p>      A similar compromise approach to your milk supply might      work out well in case it's not economical or convenient for      you to keep a cow. If you live near a farmer who has a      dairy project-and state laws will allow you to      purchase raw milk-you may be able to buy your milk by      the gallon . . . a good deal for several reasons.    </p>    <p>      First, there's the obvious difference in price. We pay our      neighbor at least 40% less than the current retail rate for      half gallons.    </p>    <p>      A second advantage to farm-bought milk is the higher cream      content. Commercial dairies package their product with just      enough butterfat to be within the law, but whole milk      direct from the cow will give you between a half pint and a      pint of cream in each gallon, ready to be skimmed off after      a day's cooling.    </p>    <p>      Raw milk from a clean, disease-free farm also gives you      added nutritional benefits . . . but if you prefer to      pasteurize, you can easily heat a kettleful to the correct      temperature at home.    </p>    <p>      An interesting sidelight on "progress": In the days when      all dairy farmers poured their milk into cans, the      containers were collected from the farms every day. Then      modern technology developed the bulk storage tank for the      producer and the bulk tank truck for transport. Pickups are      now made only every other day . . . and some milk is more      than two days old when it reaches the bottling plant.    </p>    <p>      Another good point of the old system was that all the cans      were identified and each farm's supply could be checked on      a given day for bacteria count, dirt or any other factor.      Nowadays all milk is slopped into the same tank for the      trip to the dairy, and any one supplier's output can be      tested only by actual visit to the farm. You may, in fact,      enjoy more uniform quality in the "perfect food" if you get      it directly from a reliable neighbor. <em>(In some areas      this may be hard to arrange because of complex state and      local regulations on the sale of milk direct from the      farm.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Let your personal preference and firsthand experience guide      you as you go about selecting the livestock you will and      won't raise on your new country place. And may the      suggestions I've made here help you obtain your initial      mini-flocks and small herds-or the meat, milk and      eggs you want-as inexpensively as possible.    </p>
