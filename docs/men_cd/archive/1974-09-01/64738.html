            <p>      Issue No. 29 - September/October 1974    </p>    			 <h5 id="byline">      by IVORY MARSHALL      </h5>       <p>      It ain't always easy wringing a<br /> living out of a two-acre<br />      homestead the way Ivory and<br /> Belle Marshall have done . . .<br />      but just try duplicating their<br /> success in a big city      apartment house!    </p>    <p>      My wife, Belle, and I live on a small homestead just      outside the town of Hendersonville in western North      Carolina. We bought the place 12 or 15 years ago, when I      was still able to work in restaurant and hotel kitchens and      cotton mills. During my off hours I'd haul sawdust, manure      and leaves to put on my rundown soil, since I had the idea      that crops could be raised intensively on our land as it's      done in Europe. Also, we both suspected that chemicals      might have caused my wife's cancer and were determined to      raise our food without them.    </p>    <p>      Then, about two years ago, I was totally disabled with      emphysema and came home to garden full time. My experience      has given me some ideas I'd like to pass on to those who      want to live off the land.    </p>    <p>      First-if I were going to homestead all over      again-I'd try to find two or three acres in a      secluded area, with a good spring or some other water      supply. (Of course, a well can be hand dug. . . provided      you don't hit rock so hard you can't go through.)    </p>    <p>      We bought a small cottage with our place, and I think this      is a good idea because to build and furnish a house is      rather expensive. If there is no dwelling on the land you      want, then your next best bet is to look for a good used      house trailer going cheap.    </p>    <p>      Otherwise, your homestead doesn't need elaborate buildings.      Scrap lumber available at dumps can be converted into a      barn and chicken coop (or you can find an old building to      tear down for a low price or nothing at all). If you live      near a railroad you can get old ties that have been      replaced. These make good framing for a root cellar, since      they've been creosoted and will last for several years      underground.    </p>    <p>      I'd advise putting a woven wire fence around your property.      Then if an animal gets out of the pen it won't go over into      somebody's field . . . nor will your neighbors' stock get      into your place and destroy your crops. I have such a      fence, five feet high, around my own land and have set rose      bushes, dogwood and other flowering shrubs against it. This      provides a certain amount of privacy and a lot of space for      birds to nest.    </p>    <p>      The first thing you'll need to do in the spring is to get      the garden in. Almost any farmer will plow and harrow your      land for much less than it would cost you to keep a horse      or tractor, and having a small place ensures that you can      get the job done early.    </p>    <p>      My first year I tried to garden with a rototiller but found      that my lung condition wouldn't permit it. (Belle has had      surgery that keeps her from strenuous work.) Instead, I      used large farm tractor to turn and disc the land and lay      off the first rows. Then I got out the low-wheel push plow      and started on the planting. (Incidentally, this device is      also a good cultivating tool. It will go closer to the      plants without damage than a motorized plow, and cuts the      hoeing to a minimum. I find too, that a garden wheelbarrow      is almost a must . . . saves of backaches and sore arms.)    </p>    <p>      The gardening system I use is one of close cultivation. the      average farmer makes his rows about four feet apart, I      space mine about two feet and sow a quick-maturing      vegetable grain in every other one. This automatically      doubles my acreage to begin with . . . and by removing      spent crops as as soon as they mature and planting      something else in their place, I get eight acres' worth of      production from the original two.    </p>    <p>      We raise enough vegetables for home use and have a surplus      to sell at the Curb Market in Hendersonville. If you do      like wise, by the way, you'll need plenty of jars in which      to can your produce. After your first harvest you should      have 600 to 800 containers of food put away, besides enough      last until next season.    </p>    <p>      A berry crop is also a must. Red raspberries yields two      crops a year around here and can be cultivated simply by      running a lawnmower between the rows every two weeks or so.      We put out 17 rows five years ago, pick three times a week      in season and get an average yield of 24 quarts per      picking. My wife sells the berries at the Curb Market for      $1.00 a quart and gets of orders in excess of our supply. A      strawberry bed about 20 feet wide across an acre of ground      will give you lots of fruit to preserve and freeze . . .      even some to sell.    </p>    <p>      Four years ago I set out 25 Concord grapevines, and last      season we sold $15.00 worth of grapes. (By the way, heavy      telephone wire from the dump makes a good trellis, and same      stuff is good support for pole beans.)    </p>    <p>      Field corn is planted in every corner and patch of my that      isn't taken up by vegetables . . . a practice I recommend      to anyone who wants to keep livestock. When the corn is      mature you can cut the tops, tie them in bundles and stack      them in shocks to dry. Also pull the blade fodder and      bundle it in the same way.    </p>    <p>      In your spare time, get scrap lumber and build a small barn      (with a loft for the roughage and corn shucks, since you'll      probably have 500 to 1,000 bunches). You can find old      barrels around factories for a very small price, cut one      end out of each and store your corn in these containers to      keep the rats out.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to set about 1,000 sweet potatoes. When they're      mature, cut the tops off and put them on a tripod rick to      dry. Then haul them to the barn and store them in the loft.    </p>    <p>      In between Irish potato rows you can plant hybrid millet .      . . which can be cut about three times during the summer      and shocked up to dry like the corn tops. This should give      you enough dry feed to keep a goat until another crop comes      in.    </p>    <p>      By all means plant a cover crop when harvest is over, to      make your land more fertile for next year. Rye or rape sown      at this time gives you grazing for chickens and a cow or      goat for most of the winter (in our area, anyway).    </p>    <p>      About livestock: At one time we kept three or four goats      for our milk supply, but I was forced to get rid of the      critters after one of my lungs collapsed and I could no      longer tend them. We now keep 20 to 25 laying hens and two      dogs . . . also two rabbits and one pig, which take care of      weeds and cull produce and convert it into the best      fertilizer obtainable.    </p>    <p>      All the same, I wouldn't advise a newcomer to buy livestock      until one crop has been gathered and you can estimate how      much feed you have on hand. There's nothing more      discouraging than to have a bunch of animals around and      then run out of rations for them.    </p>    <p>      You can start with chickens in the early spring by buying      25 pullets at your neighborhood farm supply store and      putting them in a brooder. I recommend a heavy breed so      that the hens will be broody next season and you can hatch      your own eggs for following years. A small house about 8 by      10 feet will accommodate 25 or 30 of the birds, and you can      let them run in the same lot with the goat.    </p>    <p>      By your second spring you'll want a pig for home use.      (There should be some corn left in the barrels to feed it.)      Keep the animal in a good tight pen at the back of the      barn, and cut a hole in the barn wall so you can put the      feed through and stay dry yourself.    </p>    <p>      All this should keep you busy through the summer months.      Winter on the homestead is a good time to pick up odd jobs,      build more onto your barn, fix up a workshop to repair your      tools, etc.    </p>    <p>      If you can find a sawmill nearby, your heating problem      shouldn't be too bad. Summer-when other people aren't      rush ing for wood or sawdust-is the time to lay in      your fuel and bedding. A bow saw is handy for cutting      discarded mill slabs into firewood.    </p>    <p>      If you can rake up about $100 to spend for a small chain      saw, you'll have your fuel supply cornered. Farmers who      have cut trees to make lumber will often give you the lops      and limbs if you cut them up. Here's where your pickup      comes in handy . . . but if you don't have a truck, a small      trailer is very useful.    </p>    <p>      Whatever kind of vehicle you have, it should be small      (gasoline is expensive). Even so, you'll still have to lay      out money for fuel, insurance, tags, tires, etc. If you      have no health problems you can get by with a bicycle for      transportation . . . but there's no getting around the need      for some kind of cash income.    </p>    <p>      In our case, a pension of less than $200 a month barely      covers lights, phone. gas, etc. In order to have food, we      must raise it. I handle that end of the homestead, and Mrs.      Marshall makes aprons and dried flower      arrangements-over $500 worth last year-to sell      at the Curb Market along with surplus crops and eggs.    </p>    <p>      If man and wife work as a team, it's possible to supplement      your income in various ways. For example, the woman can      take care of the garden while the man picks up a few extra      dollars helping other farmers prune apple trees, plow and      plant, string pole beans or pick apples. Or he might buy a      few baskets of beans, cabbage and corn and go out with the      truck to nearby towns to retail the produce to      householders. I've peddled apples this way, or maybe traded      for fruit jars, chickens, a pig or an old plow.    </p>    <p>      If you have a power mower, you can pick up extra money      cutting grass . . . and when the leaves begin to fall,      people in town will pay you to rake their yards. (Haul the      accumulation home and put- it on the compost pile.)    </p>    <p>      Some folks will also hire you to clean out a garage,      basement or attic, and will be glad to have you take away      the contents. What better place to get usable furniture and      dishes . . . even antiques? There's always a sale barn      where you can get a few bucks for your treasures.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, you won't get rich living on a couple of      acres . . . and it can't be done at all unless you have the      guts to do some real work. Homesteading gets hot and hard      before the summer's over.    </p>
