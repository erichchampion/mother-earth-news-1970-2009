            <h5 id="byline">      by ROLF MOHL    </h5>               <p>      In MOTHER NO. 24, Mr. and Mrs. John Gray asked how to make      blood sausage (also called blood pudding).    </p>    <p>      At hog-slaughtering time, have ready a cup and a half of      partially cooked rice or barley per expected gallon of      blood. (Fifty years ago we used soy flour and a small      amount of wheat flour for a binder.) For each gallon of      blood, dice into quarter-inch or so squares one pound of      baked or boiled ham fat or dry salt fatback <em>(Speck</em>      in German) and an equal amount of cured and cooked hog      tongue. Lay out coriander, allspice, cumin or related      seeds, coarse pepper and salt.    </p>    <p>      <em>(The spicing of any sausage is a matter of individual      or family preference, and Rolfs recipe resembles most such      formulas in not specifying amounts. Your best bet is to      overseason your first batch . . . keeping in mind that      blood contains salt and that the cured meats contribute      still more. Then cook a small sample of the filling, taste      it and adjust the flavor accordingly. Be sure to keep      records to guide your future attempts. -MOTHER.</em>      )    </p>    <p>      When you hoist the pig up in the air by its leg to stick      it, catch the blood in a bucket. Then stir the fluid with      your hand while it's warm. Once you gather a bit of the      fiber on your palm, the coagulant will start accumulating      in your hand. This takes a while. Stir and stir until you      have a sphere between softball and tennis ball size      (gathered from three to four gallons of blood). Mix this      well with the <em>Speck,</em> spices and other ingredients      and stuff the filling into casings. Lace the pudding with a      thick cord so it won't split (see drawing).    </p>    <p>      For casings you can use the bung gut of the animal you just      slaughtered. Make sure the intestine is cleaned thoroughly      (turn it inside out over your hand) and save the      surrounding fat to render for tallow. (You may want to keep      gut from your beef slaughter for this purpose, since a      pig's intestinal wall breaks more readily.) Use the large      end for the blood pudding . . . the middle width is kept      for leona and goose liver sausages. We used to stuff little      pork sausages and wieners into sheep casings, but these      days U.S.produced sheep gut generally splits. What is used      comes from Australia and New Zealand.    </p>    <p>      You may prefer to get casing from a butchers' supply house:      a "hank" is about the amount of gut one animal contains.      Soak salted gut approximately five hours in warm water      before filling. If you don't want to use natural casing,      here's an alternative: When grandmother made      <em>Blutwurst</em> in the copper washboiler on the kitchen      stove, she would cook it in salt sacks or muslin sewed into      bags measuring 5 by 15 inches.    </p>    <p>      When the puddings are stuffed, cook them several hours just      short of a boil. Test them with a wooden skewer . . . the      sausage is done when the filling doesn't bubble through the      hole. Let the sausages hang free (as on poles across      sawhorses) until they're dry and cooled before      refrigerating. Formerly, we'd store puddings in a      well-vented attic, where they'd keep six or seven months.      If you want them to have a smoky flavor and a slightly      lengthened storage life, put the puddings in the top of the      smokehouse several days to a week. Don't let them get hot      again . . . corncobs, for instance, make cool smoke.    </p>    <p>      <em>(For a slightly different version of</em> Blutwurst,      <em>see "Report from Dick Margulis" in MOTHER NO. 26.      -MOTHER.)</em>    </p>
