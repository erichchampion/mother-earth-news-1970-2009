        <p id="byline">The following recipe for all-natural, high protein, vitaminand mineral-enriched bread-either in biscuit or in loaf form-has taken more than five years of research and experimentation to perfect. During that time we've worked with many formulas . . . but none so far has been able to come up to this one for purity, wholesomeness and nutritional value.</p><p>While ours is essentially a bread recipe, it can well be used as a basis for nearly any baked goods: cinnamon rolls, cake . . . almost anything but piecrust. Thus it's a good alternative to the junk foods displayed and sold under false labeling at Ye Olde Supermarket.</p><p>This bread is very high in protein (an estimated 30% or more). It contains all the B-complex vitamins with their accompanying essential amino acids . . . also vitamins E, F and T, lecithin and all the minerals natural to the various components. It's totally natural, free from any harmful substance and well balanced to provide the utmost in nutrition. Although the formula contains honey and a high percentage of natural oils, it's not fattening. It <em>is</em> more expensive to make than the average white loaf, but is also much more nourishing and filling . . . so that you eat less and obtain much better nourishment for a lower actual cost.</p><p>Bread baked from our recipe-when combined with a well-rounded diet of fresh fruits, vegetables and nuts-makes it possible for anyone to be totally vegetarian without fear of malnutrition. I offer the following proof of this statement: I'm 57 (almost 58) and have not taken a pill of any kind-even vitamin or mineral supplements-since October 24, 1970. In this period of almost four years, I have been unwell only one single day . . . after I fell and did considerable damage to both legs (large cut in one and sprained foot on the other). Even though I was quite ill and feverish during that one day, the only addition to my standard diet was a few doses of plain wheat germ oil (for the vitamin E content) to aid the healing of the very deep gash on my leg. It has mended beautifully!</p><p>We would like to give our recipe to MOTHER's readers so that they too may enjoy better health through proper nutrition.</p><div class="sidebar"><h3>BLUE RIBBON,<br />ALL NATURAL,<br />HIGH PROTEIN,<br />VITAMIN- AND MINERAL-<br />ENRICHED BREAD</h3><p>1/2 cup hot water<br />1-1/2 cups cold water<br />1 tablespoon honey<br />2 tablespoons (or packets)<br />baker's dry yeast<br />whole-wheat flour (as noted below)<br />1/4 cup vegetable oil<br />2 teaspoons sea salt<br />2 heaping tablespoons<br />wheat germ<br />2 heaping tablespoons<br />soybean flour<br />2 heaping tablespoons sesame seeds<br />2 heaping tablespoons rice polish<br />1 heaping tablespoon brewer's (or nutritional) yeast. (In case you don't know the difference, nutritional yeast is made from clabbered milk-cottage cheese-and contains <em>all</em> the essential amino acids. Brewer's yeast contains only part of the amino acid complex and may be a less complete food.)</p><p>Put the hot water and honey in a 2-cup measuring container and stir until the honey is thoroughly mixed. Then add cold water to make 1 cup total and let the mixture cool to lukewarm (105 to 115° F), stir in the baker's dry yeast and allow the combined ingredients to stand for 5 minutes or until the yeast is about to run over the cup.</p><p>Line a mixing bowl (4 quarts or larger) with enough whole-wheat flour to leave a hole into which you may pour the other ingredients. In other words, about a 3/4-inch layer of flour on the bottom and around the wall all the way to the top of the container.</p><p>When the baker's yeast has risen, place it in the mixing bowl. Add the second cup of cold water, then all the other ingredients. Mix thoroughly, incorporating more flour as you work. (If you don't like to do this with your bare hands, a large, heavy table fork works fine.)</p><p>Continue mixing until the dough can be removed by hand to a biscuit board or piece of clean paper. Knead the mixture only until it can be rolled or patted out to a thickness of about 3/4 inch. (Overmixing and overkneading makes the finished product tough and hard.)</p><p>Cut the dough with a biscuit cutter about 2-1/2 inches in diameter and place the rounds in 4 rows of 3 each on a standard 8" X 8" X 2" baking pan. Let them stand for 30 minutes until they have risen to about double their original size. Then bake the biscuits for about half an hour in an oven preheated to 350°. They're done when the tops begin to brown.</p><p>If you prefer loaf bread, shape the dough, place it in a regular loaf baking pan, let the dough stand 30 minutes and bake it at 350° for about 40 to 45 minutes.</p><p>Note: You may add any other flours, ground nuts or seeds to this recipe in small quantities . . . I suggest no more than 2 heaping tablespoons of each kind. Raisins or other small dried fruits may be used in larger amounts.</p></div>
