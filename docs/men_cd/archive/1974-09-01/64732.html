                    <h5 id="byline">      by VERN COPE    </h5>    <p>      If you've been following rural land prices over the past      few years, you've probably been amazed at how rapidly the      value of acreage has increased in many parts of the      country. If you're salting away money to buy your own      homestead, in fact, the growth of your savings may only      just be matching the rising price for the type of land you      want. Then, if you do buy, the interest rates you'll pay      are exploitive and sometimes prohibitive . . . particularly      if you move onto your place right away and try to make a      living off it.    </p>    <p>      What to do? Well, you could save your money and wait for a      possible recession or depression. Or you could forsake the      dreams of owning property in your favorite area-which      is becoming flooded by retirement homes, with a resulting      drastic increase in land values-and move to one of      this country's poorer rural sections where prices are still      relatively low. Or you could consider yet another      possibility: Buy sloping land.    </p>    <p>      Over five years ago (June 1969), our group-which now      numbers eight adults and one infant-purchased 40      acres of hillside in southern Oregon. At the time, livable      tracts of this kind were selling at about one-fourth to      one-fifth the cost of flat, tillable acreage. Today the      local price of land similar to ours has almost doubled, but      level farmland has skyrocketed too.    </p>    <p>      Why live do a slope? [1] We preferred to purchase our place      outright rather than hassle with payments, [2] we wanted a      lot of land (so it had to be cheap by the acre), [3] we had      no desire to do any more than subsistence food growing and      [4] we were looking for isolation.    </p>    <p>      After much experience with hillside living, we'd like to      share our feelings and knowledge with others who are      interested in buying what's commonly called "marginal"      land. A tract so described can be gently sloping to steep      and may include small patches of relatively flat ground.      The term may also, of course, apply to part of a parcel      which is mainly farm acreage. No matter what portion of the      land is hilly, it will be cheaper per acre than flat,      cleared property in the same area. But price is only one      factor to consider before you buy. .    </p>    <h3>      SLOPE    </h3>    <p>      Let's think first about the slope of the land and how it      will affect your life. Obviously, the less grade the      better: You'll spend a lot of your time walking up and      down, which can be a drag (particularly in wet, muddy      weather). Still, that activity does put you in shape and      you'll notice the hills less the longer you live on such a      homestead.    </p>    <p>      Another disadvantage to a slope is that-unless you      own a fourwheel-drive vehicle-you'll have limited      access to the steeper portions when you're hauling      construction materials, manure, firewood or anything else      that's heavy and bulky. It's possible to pull some building      supplies and logs fairly easily, downhill, but not up.    </p>    <p>      One way to get manure to gardens and orchards, and fir,      wood to houses, is to rig up a cart or trailer which can be      lowered with a strong rope or cable attached to a trucks on      your road. We've also used trams and slides with success.      Just be sure you have plenty of access for motor transport,      and that most of your acreage is <em>below</em> the road.    </p>    <p>      Of course, a four-wheel-drive vehicle solves those problems      for most of the year. The best strategy is to make sure      you've got enough enough money left over to buy one after      you've bought the land!    </p>    <h3>      WATER    </h3>    <p>      Flatland folks usually have to pump the water they use for      irrigation and in their homes from wells or some abovegroud      source. This entails the initial expense of the necessary      machinery plus its maintenance and the cost of the energy      to run it. People on marginal property, however, can make      use of inexpensive, pollution-free gravity-flow supplies.    </p>    <p>      Near the top of the slope on our place we have a small dam      which collects water and empties it into a 600-gallon      storage tank located just below the dam and off to the      side. At the bottom of this reinforced concrete reservoir      (cost of construction tion: only $50.00) are outlet pipes      that distribute the water to several buildings and to our      garden and orchard.    </p>    <p>      Some friends of ours a few miles away live on sloping land      with a sizable creek. Since they have no need to store      water, their pipes for irrigation and home use are simply      placed in the stream at the top of their property. (Of      course, surface water must always be checked for      contamination before it's used for drinking and bathing.)    </p>    <p>      Speaking of water, it's good to know that-as the      owner of marginal land-you'll be high and safe during      floods. And in more normal times you'll have good drainage      around your buildings and in your orchard . . . where this      factor can be very important to the health of your tree.    </p>    <h3>      FOOD    </h3>    <p>      Before you buy a hillside spread, you should consider the      several pros and cons of growing food on it. First,      remember that marginal land is the last to be developed for      farming (it's generally wooded, large machinery doesn't      work it well and-in any case-the pioneers were      attracted to the more fertile soil of the valley below).      Therefore, you're probably going to have to clear your      garden and orchard area . . . and clearing land      particularly by hand, is hard work. One consolation: The      process at least gives you poles for building and firewood.    </p>    <p>      On the plus side, marginal property is often separated by      some distance from valley land, which reduces the risk of      entrenched harmful pests on your cultivated food plants and      trees. Then, too, those woods around your garden and      orchard make a nice windbreak and cut down on the chances      of frost. And, since you're probably located above a      valley, you'll realize yet another plus for your crops: At      night, warm air from the land below rises and creeps up the      surrounding slopes. This increases the ground-level      temperature and stretches the growing season. We reckon      ours to be one to two months longer than that in the      valley, thanks to earlier last frosts in the spring and      later first autumn frosts.    </p>    <p>      One more point: If possible, get sloping land that has a      southern exposure. You'll be a lot happier in the long run.      We didn't think about this when we bought our place, and      settled for a north-facing hillside. The result is less      light for our crops in the spring and fall, and a winter      with lots of cold winds and little sun to keep up our      morale.    </p>    <h3>      OFF BY YOURSELF    </h3>    <p>      Since marginal acreage has been much less popular for      development than flat tracts (especially in the West),      you're likely to be somewhat isolated . . . maybe miles      from the nearest neighbor. Your place might border on      public lands, and could even be virgin. Such a life, of      course, can be very peaceful. When you're really off in the      woods-alone or with good friends-your pace is      slower, you won't hear much traffic (unless there's logging      nearby!) and it'll be a lot easier to commune with nature.      Still, this condition does have its negative aspects . . .      which become obvious fairly soon.    </p>    <p>      One problem is that roads to marginal areas are often      primitive and poorly maintained. This probably means you'll      be stuck a lot in mud and snow. Also-although getting      away from it all sounds good now-you might find later      that electricity for blenders, power tools, etc., would be      a real blessing, and that a phone sure would eliminate a      lot of hassles. Unfortunately, the farther back you are,      the less chance there is that these hookups will be      available on your land. The nearest powerlines are two      miles from our place and the cost of bringing them up here      would be thousands of dollars. Since our stream isn't large      enough for a small hydroelectric system, our only option is      a noisy, polluting gas generator.    </p>    <p>      Another drawback of isolation is that we have many more      wild animals around than there are down in the more      populated valley. We have to elevate our hives on platforms      or surround them with electrified wire to keep the bears      from rob bing them. Coyotes, mountain lions and the like      endanger our goats and chickens. . . and deer will go on      nibbling our garden and orchard until we have the time and      money to fence them out. Also, where there are deer and      bear, you can expect lots of hunters in season. Although      this problem diminishes over the years as people learn      where you are, it's still no fun to confront every      sportsman who trespasses on your land.    </p>    <h3>      MAKIN' BUCKS    </h3>    <p>      Another thought has probably crossed your mind by now: What      about making money on marginal land? As I've already      mentioned, farming is out of the question in most      instances. It's hard enough for a small operator to make a      profit on good flat acreage . . . and almost impossible if      you're working a slope.    </p>    <p>      One alternative is to take advantage of your woods.      Depending on what kind of trees you have, you could log,      cut firewood, grow nursery stock or harvest Christmas      trees. In some states, wooded land which will be used for      commercial purposes is given a special "timberland" tax      status. Such laws were really developed for the benefit of      the large timber interests, but you should still apply for      this classification if you can. Here in Oregon we declare      38 of our 40 acres as timberland, which is assessed at      one-eighth of the ordinary evaluation while the remainder      (space for houses, outbuildings, garden and orchard) is      assessed at the full figure . . . giving us a substantial      reduction on our tax bill.    </p>    <p>      Crafts-which don't usually require flat terrain or a      lot of space-are another possibility. Or you could      raise goats, or rabbits and earthworms in conjunction. We'd      also like to recommend beekeeping as a reasonable way to      bring in money with relatively little expense and work. A      number of hives and a honey house take up only a small      amount of land, and isolation is an advantage because      there's less chance of competition from other apiaries.      Since you're also less likely to have to worry about      contamination from pesticides, you'll be able to produce an      organic honey which is in great demand both economically      and nutritionally.    </p>    <h3>      AND FINALLY . . .    </h3>    <p>      Even if you do have the money and the inclination for good      farm acreage, you'll be wise to consider a tract which      includes some marginal land. You could then situate some of      your buildings on slopes, where they'd be protected from      flooding and wouldn't use space in the more valuable      fertile portions. The marginal area could also be a good      source of wood and gravity-fed water. Make the best use of      the hilly and flat areas on your place, and you'll have a      sensibly arranged homestead that eliminates the drawbacks      of both.    </p>
