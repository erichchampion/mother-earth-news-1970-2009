            		           <p>      The first hard frost of autumn is dreaded by most of my      neighbors, because its arrival marks the end of the bright      flowers and hints at the approach of winter. But I, and      everyone who shares my secret, anxiously await that cold      snap . . . for to us it means the ripening of the      persimmon.    </p>    <p>      Persimmon trees have grown wild in America for centuries.      Their range stretches from New Jersey to Nebraska and      southward to the Gulf. Early settlers learned that the      flame-colored fruit could be made into a variety of tasty      dishes . . . but first, by trial and error, those same      settlers had to learn the secret of its harvest.    </p>        <p>      When the fruit hangs plump and luscious-looking from the      tree, it's a sorry person who tastes it. One bite of the      firm persimmon and your mouth puckers up as though you'd      gulped a glass of vinegar. Once the bright morsel has been      touched by frost, though-when it hangs from the tree      wrinkle-skinned and soft-a persimmon is sweet and has      a spicy, plum-like flavor.    </p>    <p>      In the southernmost states-where frost is unlikely      and the persimmon ripens by aging-it's usually      wrinkled and ready to pick by early December. The process      can be hastened by placing the firm fruit in the      refrigerator for two or three days and then bringing it out      into room temperature for several days more.    </p>    <p>      The whole persimmon is delicious as a between-meal treat,      just as an apple or orange is. Or it may be peeled and      sliced for a tempting addition to a fruit salad.    </p>    <p>      For the majority of persimmon recipes, however, you need      only pulp . . . so, once you've gathered the fruit, wash it      and press your harvest through a colander. Since most      dishes require only a cup of the resulting mash, you'll      probably find it most convenient to pack and freeze      containers holding just that amount.    </p>    <p>      At my house the favorite persimmon specialty is pudding,      but close runners-up include bread, cookies and cake. By      experimenting with your own recipes and substituting the      wild fruit for pumpkin, applesauce and similar ingredients,      you can easily develop new dishes every year.    </p>        <p class="caption">      EDITORS NOTE: For additional information about finding,      harvesting and cooking with persimmons, see "Persimmons!"      by Victor A. Croley, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), NO. 5,      page 52.    </p>   <div class="sidebar"><h3>»» recipes </h3>       <p>      Once you've discovered the flavorful and nutritious      difference that persimmon makes in your winter menus,      you'll be as anxious as I am for that first frost of      autumn. Here are a few recipes to get you started:    </p>    <p>      <strong>PERSIMMON FRUIT SALAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Combine 1 can (11-ounce) of mandarin oranges (drained), 2      cups of diced apples, 2 sliced bananas and 1/2 cup sliced      persimmons with 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts. Blend 1/2      cup salad dressing with 1/4 cup whipped cream and 1      teaspoon sugar. Pour this combination over the fruit and      mix well. Chili the salad before serving. Serves four.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PERSIMMON BREAD</strong><br />      <br />      2 cups flour<br />      2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      1 cup persimmon pulp<br />      1 cup sugar<br />      1/2 cup milk<br />      2 eggs<br />      1 /4 cup softened butter or margarine<br />      1 cup chopped nuts (optional)    </p>    <p>      Sift together the first six ingredients. Combine the      persimmon, sugar, milk and eggs, add the flour mixture and      the softened butter and mix until the dough is well      blended. Stir in the nuts. Spread the batter in a      well-greased loaf pan (9" X 5" X 3") and bake it at      350° for 45 minutes or until done. This bread freezes      well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PERSIMMON PUDDING</strong><br />      <br />      1 cup flour<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br />      1 teaspoon baking powder<br />      1 cup sugar<br />      1 egg<br />      1/2 stick margarine, melted<br />      1-1/2 cups milk<br />      3/4 cup persimmon pulp    </p>    <p>      Sift together the first four ingredients. Combine the      sugar, egg, margarine, milk and persimmon. Slowly add the      flour mixture and blend everything together. (It's best to      do this with an electric mixer at medium speed, since the      mixture tends to be lumpy when beaten by hand.) Pour the      batter into a wellgreased 8" X 8" pan and bake it one hour      at 350°. Don't worry if the pudding falls . . . it      often does, and tastes even better that way. This dish      freezes well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PERSIMMON DROP COOKIES</strong><br />      <br />      1 cup melted butter or margarine<br />      1 cup brown sugar<br />      2 eggs<br />      1 cup persimmon pulp<br />      2 cups flour<br />      1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/4 teaspoon cloves or nutmeg<br />      1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional)    </p>    <p>      Cream together the butter, brown sugar, eggs and persimmon.      Gradually add the dry ingredients, mix until well blended      and stir in the nuts. Drop the batter by teaspoonfuls on      lightly greased cookie sheets and bake each batch 10      minutes at 350°. Yield: approximately four dozen      cookies. (Note that occasionally-after a dry growing      season-the persimmon pulp will lack moisture. In that      case, add 1/4 cup milk to this recipe.)    </p>    <p>   <strong>PERSIMMON BLACK WALNUT CAKE (ONE LAYER)</strong></p>       <p>      3/4 cup sugar<br />          pinch of ground cloves<br />      1 cup plus 6 tablespoons cake flour<br />      3 tablespoons melted margarine<br />      2/3 teaspoon baking powder<br />      1/2 cup milk<br />      2/3 teaspoon baking soda<br />      1/2 cup persimmon pulp<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1 egg<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/4 cup chopped black walnuts<br />      Combine the dry ingredients, add the margarine, milk and      persimmon pulp and blend well by hand or with a mixer. Add      the egg, mix again and stir in the black walnuts. Pour the      batter into a well-greased 8" X 8" pan and bake it at      350° for 35 minutes or until done. When the cake is      cool, frost it with burnt-sugar icing or some other      favorite . . . or serve it with a lemon sauce or similar      topping.</p></div>
