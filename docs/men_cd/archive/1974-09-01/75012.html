                    <h5 id="byline">      by CRAIG WILSON:    </h5>    <p>      Everyone loves a success story, and the article "Gamble for      Your Homestead Front Money!" by Mrs. W.G. McCusker (MOTHER      NO. 27) made good reading. I'm sure we're all delighted      that the couple were fortunate enough to obtain a $16,000      home in bad shape, fix it up and sell it two months later      for $21,950. Readers who follow the McCuskers' advice      exactly, however, may not be so lucky.    </p>    <p>      First, Mr. and Mrs. McCusker were willing to accept      friendly advice from a real estate agent, from a tool      rental firm and from almost everyone else . . . but they      didn't trust the banker. Yet banks, too, are there to make      money, and generally find they can make more if they give      good service and win friends.    </p>    <p>      I suspect that the couple might have saved expenses if they      had explained their idea to a banker and found out whether      they actually needed to set up a mortgage at all. Some sort      of short-term note might well have lowered the closing cost      and spared them the other fees normally involved in      arranging a long-term agreement.    </p>    <p>      Also, substantial penalties are sometimes required when a      mortgage is closed out extremely early or excess payments      are made on it quickly. These charges are designed to cover      the costs which the bank incurred in setting up the      unnecessary mortgage.    </p>    <p>      Another point: My own feeling is that the McCuskers wasted      a lot of travel time by living elsewhere. It would have      been simpler to stay in their new house-in sleeping      bags in the spare room or something-to avoid the      additional cost of renting an apartment. Not only that but      fire insurance and some form of homeowners' liability      insurance (necessary to satisfy the banker) are often      considerably more costly for an unoccupied dwelling.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that an empty house-no matter how      secure it is-quickly becomes a target for vandals.      Youngsters in a neighborhood know when a building is unused      . . . and one or two small children, armed with a brick and      a box of crayons, could have done substantial damage to the      McCuskers' face lift.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of face lift, I see no indication in the article      that Bill and his wife obtained a building permit for any      of their remodeling . . . especially the putting up of      partitions in the basement. Local building codes may ban or      limit this in some way because cellar rooms have little      access to the exterior and an occupant may be trapped in      case of fire. Therefore, it's always smart to contact the      city, village, township or county building department at      the outset, get a permit and find out what you can and      can't do. My own personal experience is that building      inspectors are pretty good guys and will spend hours      filling you in on things you need to know to do the job      properly and safely.    </p>    <p>      Finally-though Mrs. McCusker didn't mention any      electrical work-might as well cover that too. The      electrical inspector will usually let the homeowner do      whatever kind of wiring he wants to in his own residence,      because he himself lives in it and takes the risk of any      hazardous connections. If you're fixing up a place where      you don't live, however, the official is apt to insist that      you have a licensed electrician do the work.    </p>    <p>      I hope these suggestions will be considered by anyone who      wants to repair an older home, as the McCuskers did.    </p>    <p>      <em>Craig Wilson</em> is director of the Akron Beacon      Journal "Action Line".    </p>         <p>      <strong>DAVID L. BENNETT:</strong>    </p>    <p>      I want to comment on Mrs. W.G. McCusker's article on      renovating a house for resale (MOTHER NO. 27) because of a      disappointing experience I had looking for a home in      Baltimore (I'm still looking).    </p>    <p>      I found an older house in a good, convenient location, with      plenty of room, a good floor plan and a large yard.      Unfortunately, the owner had bought it a year before with      the sole intention of making some superficial cosmetic      "improvements" and reselling it for a profit. He never      lived in the place himself, and his work showed it: He      consistently used materials and workmanship which I'm sure      he would not have used in his own home. . . but would      cheerfully inflict on someone else for a quick profit.    </p>    <p>      The prospective seller had even-as Mrs. McCusker      advises-covered a solid oak plank floor with cheap      carpeting. ("City set" notwithstanding, I have never met      anyone who preferred carpet to good oak.) The interior was      finished in contractor-grade, bargain-basement materials      from top to bottom, and painted in nice "neutral colors" to      give it all the personality of a loaf of commercial white      bread. The final insult was an outrageous price. What would      have been an almost perfect house for my wife and I to make      over for ourselves had been effectively ruined by the      owner's remodeling for profit rather than for living.    </p>    <p>      I believe the McCuskers were more conscientious and      industrious than the owner I met, but they were working on      the same principle: the most obvious cosmetic face lift      with the least expenditure of money and effort, and the      intentional depersonalization of a home to appeal to a      market rather than an individual family.    </p>    <p>      The idea can still be a good one, but consider making      changes in substance rather than facade. A careful buyer      will appreciate a sound roof or heating system more than a      barrage of cheap paneling or neutral-color paint      everywhere.    </p>
