                        <p>      <strong>In MOTHER NO. 28</strong> I described a homemade      ecosystem . . . an underground hydroponic greenhouse and      aquaculture tank which I recently built on my small New      Mexico homestead. In that article I discussed the      construction procedure and philosophical rationale of the      project. Now I'd like to expand on some of the details: in      this installment, specifically, the subject of hydroponic      gardening.    </p>    <p>      The <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English      Language</em> defines "hydroponics" as follows:    </p>    <p>      <em>hy-dro-pon-ics (hi' dre-pon'iks) n. Plural in form,      used</em> <em>with a singular verb. The cultivation of      plants in water containing dissolved inorganic nutrients,      rather than in soil ....</em>    </p>    <p>      Most plants grown hydroponically are raised in greenhouses      under carefully controlled conditions. Gravel is usually      used as a medium for root support, and a balanced mixture      of all the necessary nutrients is periodically fed to the      crops in a liquid form. This method is called      "sub-irrigation culture". In large commercial greenhouses      it's been refined to such a degree that-once the      seedlings have been planted-almost all the work is      done by automation. Delicate sensors in the gravel "decide"      when the plants need more solution and turn on pumps which      meter out the correct dosage.    </p>    <p>      The biggest advantage of the hydroponic method is that crop      yields are increased many times over those of conventional      agriculture. For example, the yield per acre of tomatoes      grown in soil is from five to ten tons. With hydroponics,      the harvest is from 60 to 300 tons! For cucumbers, the      equivalent figures are 7,000 pounds compared with 28,000      pounds . . . for lettuce, 9,000 pounds and 21,000 pounds.    </p>    <p>      For years I'd heard about hydroponic gardening, but had      never given the subject more room in my thoughts than a      quickly contemptuous dismissal. After all, hydroponics is      the quintessential form of chemical agriculture . . . and,      to a dyed-in-the-wool organic gardener like me, the thought      of feeding my vegetables with a pure chemical solution was      blasphemy. Then one day about two years ago, I was browsing      in a bookstore and came upon a thin newsprint pamphlet with      the title <em>Hydroponics!.</em> My first reaction was an      almost irrational disgust: "What kind of propaganda are the      big chemical companies putting out <em>now?"</em> But the      work had the aura of a counterculture publication: large      format, cheap paper and on the cover a reproduction of      Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion map of the world. I picked up      the booklet, gingerly leafed through it and then bought it      on the spot.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hydroponics!-</em> by Steve Fox of Albuquerque,      New Mexico-is definitely not a big business promotion      for chemical fertilizers. On the contrary, it is the      enlightened vision of a man who sees hydroponic agriculture      as one solution to the coming world famine, and an      <em>alternative</em> to the destruction of our once fertile      soil with chemicals. Fox proposes that extensive use of      hydroponic greenhouses, with their greater yields of      produce, would actually free our cropland for organic      agriculture! In other words, instead of poisoning our soil      with chemical fertilizers which eventually destroy the      micro-organisms that make natural plant growth possible, we      would keep these chemicals in the controlled environment of      a greenhouse where they couldn't "poison" anything more      valuable than the gravel beds which serve as the      root-support medium for hydroponically grown plants.    </p>    <p>      "But wait a minute!" you're probably saying. "What about      the plants themselves? I'm not going to eat any vegetables      that were grown in a chemical solution!" A good point, and      one which used to bother me, until I did some research on      the subject. A report in the March 11, 1974      <em>Newsweek</em> on the annual meeting of the American      Association for the Advancement of Science quoted the      following opinions expressed by the nation's top      nutritionists:    </p>    <p>      <em>. . . the organic nutritionists' basic error is their      assertion that organically grown foods are more nutritious      than others because they receive all their nutrients from      "natural" rather than synthetic inorganic sources. `A basic      fact of plant nutrition is that plant roots absorb the      nutrients elements from the soil only in an inorganic      form,</em> <em>explained plant physiologist Daniel I. Arnon      of the University of California. "Plant nutrients in      organic manures and composts become available to plants      only after they are converted into inorganic form by the      activity of soil microorganisms . . . "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The experts at San Francisco were at pains to point out      that they were not disparaging so-called natural foods. .      .</em> <em>that is, products free of additives,      preservatives, artificial coloring and other chemicals      added after the food has been harvested. "The health food      advocates may be on legitimate ground when they attack a      number of additives found in foods," conceded Allentown,      Pennsylvania psychiatrist Stephen Barret, a prime critic of      the organic-growth industry. "However, they tend to lump      together arguments for organic gardening and against food      additives as though one is naturally linked to the      other-when, in fact, they are entirely different      issues. "</em>    </p>    <p>      Another article, entitled "Nutritional Value of Organically      Grown Foods Same As That Using Commercial Products",      appearing in the March 10, <em>1974 Sante Fe New      Mexican,</em> had this to say about the subject:    </p>    <p>      <em>"Promoted and accepted by many people is the theory      that foods grown "naturally" provide greater nutrition. .      .</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>But absolutely no scientific evidence that this is so      was gleaned by the Michigan Experiment Station in a 10 year      study, or by the U.S. Plant, Soil and Nutrition Laboratory      in Ithaca, New York in a 25 year program, or in a      34-year-long study on an experimental research farm in      England.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>These studies found that while soil improvement can      increase the yield and size of crops, the nutrition factors      of the food grown in such soil aren't altered . . .</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>All food scientists agree that all fertilizer elements      have to be in a soluble form before any plant can use them      . . . Once converted into the soluble form, the plant      neither knows the difference nor does it make different use      of them.</em>    </p>    <p>      Now, before anyone takes me to task for advocating the use      of chemical fertilizers-as these quotes seem to      do-let me explain my position further. There's an      adage in organic gardening that goes like this: "When      fertilizing, always remember that the objective of the      organic method is to feed the soil, not necessarily the      plant." In other words, if you build your soil with organic      material, you will eventually provide enough nutrients to      grow healthy produce.    </p>    <p>      The spreading of chemical fertilizers, however, does just      the opposite: It feeds the crops and not the land. The      result is that the micro-organisms which break down organic      material into the chemical form that plants can use are      starved out, and the soil literally dies.    </p>    <p>      Purely and simply, to put raw chemical fertilizer on the      soil is not unlike giving hard narcotics to a human being.      A man on a steady maintenance dose of heroin, for example,      can live a completely "normal" life <em>as long as he      receives that dose.</em> If the drug is taken away from      him, he suffers withdrawal symptoms and can no longer      function. It's the same with the land. Once the natural      micro-organisms have been destroyed by artificial      fertilizers, the soil is to all intents a "junkie". Nothing      will grow on it unless it receives its dose of chemicals.    </p>    <p>      In hydroponic gardening, however, there is no soil, so the      plants can be fed the exact nutrients they need for rapid      growth and volume production. Does this sound like a      typical agribusiness statement? Maybe so . . . but bear in      mind that the earth is already unable to feed its      continually growing population. That's one reason why      chemicals are being used: "Natural" methods can no longer      keep up with the tremendous demand for food. The situation      is bad, and getting worse. Doesn't it make more sense to      solve a part of our problem with hydroponic methods rather      than poison our cropland beyond the point of recovery?    </p>    <p>      Even if agricultural chemicals didn't destroy the      soil-and even if they didn't wash into our lakes and      streams and seep into the water table as      pollutants-the use of artificial fertilizers on      cropland would still be bad ecology. Petroleum is one      <em>of</em> the major sources of such products . . . and it      doesn't take an Einstein to see what is bound to happen to      farmers who continue to rely on them. With our petroleum      resources rapidly vanishing, what will those producers do      with soil that's hooked on chemicals? And what will happen      to the world's food supply?    </p>    <p>      "But," you might ask, "what about the chemicals used to      make up the hydroponic solution? Aren't they derived from      petroleum? Even if hydroponic gardening, properly done,      doesn't cause pollution, won't it create a needless drain      on a finite resource?"    </p>    <p>      To be quite frank, I don't know how the commercially      available hydroponic chemicals are manufactured, or what      raw materials they are derived from. And, while it's true      that I'm using a conventional product in my tanks at the      present time, my objective is to develop a hydroponic      solution which is derived from <em>organic</em> materials.      Fox, in his pamphlet, gives us a hint as to how an organic      hydroponic solution might be created:    </p>    <p>      <em>the end product of... regular composting, or      manure</em> <em>itself, can be put into a burlap bag which,      in turn, is put</em> <em>into solution. The proper mixture      consists of 1/2 bushel</em> <em>of manure for fifty gallons      of water. This solution</em> <em>which is very rich, and      should be used about once every ten</em>      <em>days-could be used daily if the solution is      weaker . . . .</em>    </p>    <p>      In all my research into the available literature, this is      the only reference I have found to an organic hydroponic      solution. Obviously, most hydroponic gardeners rely on the      commercially prepared product. Perhaps the time has come      for some basic research into an organically derived formula      which can be duplicated by anyone with reasonable accuracy.    </p>    <p>      <em>The Complete Book of Composting</em> (Rodale Press,      1971) gives the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium      (K) percentages of most common organic materials. (For      example, rabbit manure has NPK percentages of 7.0, 2.4 and      0.6.) The method I intend to explore in my greenhouse is to      mix the proper proportions of organic materials, compost      them, feed the compost to earthworms, and then leach the      earthworm castings with water to get my hydroponic      solution.    </p>    <p>      The reason for using earthworms is twofold: [1] the worms      can be used as fish food (remember, the greenhouse contains      an aquaculture tank!) and [2] earthworm castings are known      to be just about the richest organic material around.      Rodale's <em>The Complete Book of Composting</em> quotes      Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer's opinion that "The earthworm      excrements, the so-called castings, are the richest and      purest humus matter in the world", and adds the following      from the writings of Sir Albert Howard: "The casts . . .      contain everything the crop needs-nitrates,      phosphates and potash in abundance and also in just the      condition in which the plant can make use of them."    </p>    <p>      I don't expect this project to be quite as easy as it may      sound. For one thing, there are many micro-nutrients and      trace elements which plants require for good growth . . .      and finding natural, readily available sources of such      chemicals may be difficult. Meanwhile, the greenhouse has      been in existence just one year and-so far-I've      concentrated on learning this new method of agriculture by      using "conventional" methods.    </p>    <p>      As I mentioned briefly in the first article of this series,      my hydroponic tanks are made from four 55-gallon drums      (each one cut in half lengthwise to make a total of eight      tanks). At the bottom front of every trough is brazed a      three-inch piece of 1/2" O.D. brass tubing. A length of      ordinary garden hose (1/2" I.D.) is clamped to this tube,      and the other end attached to a similar tube which has been      brazed onto a five-gallon can. The insides of both the tank      and the can are painted with a thick coating of an      asphalt-based paint. (This is necessary to prevent the      metal surfaces from rusting, since they are constantly      exposed to moisture.) The tank itself is filled to within a      few inches of the top with pea-sized gravel. It's essential      that a small piece of galvanized or fiberglass screen be      placed over the inlet tube inside the container before      gravel is installed, to prevent pebbles from clogging the      hose.    </p>    <p>      My procedure for planting the tanks is to start seedlings      in paper cups full of vermiculite, with the bottoms of the      containers perforated enough to allow the hydroponic      solution to enter. Once the plants are well started, it's a      simple matter to place the entire cup in the gravel.    </p>    <p>      The five-gallon can is filled with the hydroponic solution.      When it's time to feed the plants, the container is lifted      so that it's higher than the tank. The fluid runs down the      hose and into the gravel, irrigating the plant roots from      below. (That's why they call this method "sub-irrigation"      culture.) As soon as the can is empty, it's placed back      down on the floor and the liquid flows out of the gravel,      down the hose and back where it came from. I do this three      times a day-morning, noon and evening-so that      the roots of my crops are always moist but never actually      flooded with solution for more than a few moments.    </p>    <p>      The hydroponic solution I'm using at present-until I      can develop an organic substitute-is called Hyponex and is      readily available in most nurseries. It comes in a powder      form, with complete directions on the box for mixing and      use. I've found it both inexpensive and effective.    </p>    <p>      I can attest that this method really works. At this writing      (April 1974), we have growing in the greenhouse the      healthiest, largest lettuce, spinach and cabbage we've ever      raised. I've seen radish and lettuce plants become      measurably larger from one day to the next! We find that      lettuce, especially, grows like a weed and almost takes      over the greenhouse if we don't trim it regularly for      salads every evening.    </p>    <p>      To sum up, then, let me quote once more from      <em>Hydroponics!</em> by Steve Fox:    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>HYDROPONICS OFFERS THESE      ADVANTAGES:</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>FIRST LEVEL</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>1.

Possibility of letting land lie fallow<br />      3. Less labor to harvest<br />      4. Methods could be standardized<br />      S.

Oxygen production in urban      areas<br /></em> <em>3. Autonomous self-contained optimum      environment<br /></em> <em>4. Space travel</em>    </p>    <p>      With the world facing a food shortage of unimaginable      proportions (read <em>The Population Bomb</em> by Paul      Ehrlich), hydroponic agriculture could provide a viable      alternative to starvation . . . if not for the whole world,      then at least for those individuals who can read the      handwriting on the wall.    </p>    <p>      In the next installment I'll describe how wind-generated      electricity provides the power to heat my greenhouse and      aerate the fish tank.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BOOKS ON HYDROPONICS</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Hydroponics!</strong> Steve Fox, Station A,      Albuquerque, New Mexico 87106, 1971.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Hydroponics as a Hobby:</strong> Growing Plants      Without Soil, Circular 844, free from Publications Office,      College of Agriculture, University of Illinois, Urbana,      Illinois 61801.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>"Copyright</em></strong> Newsweek, Inc., 1974,      <strong><em>reprinted by permission.</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      Taken from: <em>Hydroponics! by</em> Steve Fox    </p>    <p>      <strong>A THOUGHT ON HYDROPONICS</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>. . . (when people) are unemployed, as millions have      been during the last decade, they cannot buy their food but      still must be fed.

The unemployed must become      farmers themselves, and produce their own subsistence . .      .</em> The answer lies in hydroponics, which can operate      wherever climate is available and produce on a small plot      the same amount of food as can agriculture on a large farm.      <em>It offers the most feasible method of removing the      unemployed from towns and cities where private employment      for all of them may never again be available and of      allowing them to support themselves.
