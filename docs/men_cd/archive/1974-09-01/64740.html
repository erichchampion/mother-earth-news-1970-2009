                              <h5 id="byline">by Kris Torrey    </h5>    <p>      H ave you heard the news today? Energy crunch, money      crisis, shortages . . . and predictions of worldwide famine      within two years because the population of the earth is      exceeding the productive capacity of the land.    </p>    <p>      What can you do to protect yourself and your family? One of      the best insurance policies to own in these times is a      year's supply of food. (Ideally, the planning should      include other necessities too, since warmth, cleanliness,      medication and so on may also be essential to your own      survival and that of your loved ones.) Once you prepare      yourself to live for a twelve-month period without any      income, you'll find that you're ready for strikes, floods,      earthquakes, power failures, unemployment, tornadoes, war,      epidemics, riots, etc. The feeling of security is      fantastic!    </p>    <p>      The main theme of any survival program is "Rely on      yourself". In a true emergency or panic, grocery stores      would be out of staples in a few hours and completely      emptied of food in about two days. Their wholesalers'      supplies would be exhausted within a week.    </p>    <p>      And don't expect public or private social agencies to step      in and fill the gap. The Red Cross has limited resources      that are already overtaxed. Even the government and the      many service organizations it sponsors may not be willing      or able to subsidize everyone during a large-scale disaster      . . . and certainly not during a depression. Here, then, is      a step-by-step plan to offer you the best chance of getting      through the worst the future can hold.    </p>             <h3>WATER</h3>       <p>      Water is the first and most basic need for survival. You      can live for weeks without food but only two or three days      at the most without this precious fluid. In the event of      nuclear disaster, terrorist sabotage, tornado, chemical and      bacterial warfare or accident, the public water supply may      become contaminated. Therefore, your own cache is of prime      importance.    </p>    <p>      You should have on hand one gallon of good drinking water      per person per day for a period of two to three weeks. This      is a survival ration which precludes bathing, dishwashing,      shampooing and other uses which are not absolutely      essential. If you live in an arid climate, you may feel      more secure with a larger reserve. If your home is in a      remote area and has a deep well, you might get by with      less. Whatever your situation, though, the establishment of      a water cache is very important and very inexpensive.      <em>Do it now!</em>    </p>    <p>      Storage of a water supply is extremely flexible. Some      people use tanks, or purchase five-gallon jerrycans. The      most inexpensive scrounge method I've ever seen anyone put      together consists of making rather daily rounds to      laundromats to collect empty Clorox jugs (plastic      containers which have held various other products may allow      harmful or distasteful residues to leach into your      reserve.) The bottles are filled from an indoor tap,      identified as "DRINKING WATER" with a Marks-A-Lot or other      felt-tipped marking pen (remove the paper label first) and      squirreled away in odd nooks and crannies around the house      wherever space permits. If four drops of any 5-1 /2 or 6%      hypochlorite bleach such as Clorox or Purex are added at      bottling time, the liquid will remain sweet for years . . .      except for a flat taste which is easily cured by aeration      before use.    </p>    <p>      If you can your garden produce, the jars-as they are      emptied-may be filled with water for storage and thus      made useful the year round. Should you choose to hot pack      such containers and close them with caps that seal, don't      add chlorine. The canning procedure will eliminate any      bacteria.    </p>         <h3>MEDICINE</h3>     <p>      The second pressing need in any survival program is for an      advance supply of drugs for those who must take medication      on a regular basis. This group includes heart patients,      epileptics, diabetics, women who must-for health      reasons-avoid pregnancy and all others whose lives      might depend on a store of medicine. Visit your doctor and      explain to him that-in case a strike of      pharmaceutical company employees or truckers, or a civil      disturbance, should temporarily deprive you of your supply      of drugs or access to their source-you would like a      standby reserve.    </p>    <p>      Whatever you do, <em>do not</em> store away the extra      medication your doctor arranges for you. Use your regular      supply, then the reserve . . . which, in turn, has just      been replaced with your next prescription. Thus, you'll      always rotate your stock to keep the drugs fresh. If      possible, use this method over a period of time to build up      a year's supply of medication and make sure you have at      least two weeks' reserve to start.    </p>         <h3>SHORT-TERM FOOD SUPPLY</h3>     <p>      The third priority in your survival program is a food      supply of at least two weeks' balanced diet. The very best      advice on this subject available at present is the U.S.      Department of Agriculture Home and Garden Bulletin No. G77,      <em>Family Food Stockpile for Survival,</em> available free      from the Office of Information, U.S. Department of      Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250. Although the      publication is very much slanted to the home fallout      shelter enthusiasm of the late 1950's, the information it      contains is solid and applicable to present situations. The      booklet covers storage and replacement of foods, sample      meals and menus, cooking and serving equipment, storage and      purification of water and recordkeeping.    </p>      <h3>DEFENSE AND FIRST AID</h3> 			<p>      If you live in a large city, you will have to      expect-at some time or another in a survival      situation-to defend your life and goods. There may      come a period when the law of the jungle is the only law in      effect, and you will be forced to live by it or be killed.      I feel a considerable amount of revulsion at the idea of      deliberately harming another human being, and would rather      protect myself by avoidance. I find, however, that I must      face the prospect of being unable to escape a confrontation      and having to defend myself and my own.    </p>    <p>      In the role of defender, one should choose a weapon that is      inexpensive, easily used by male or female and adequate to      stop an aggressor (not necessarily to kill one). Make sure      all who are to use it are thoroughly trained. Remember,      firearms are always dangerous and should never be stored      loaded. <em>Keep all arms and ammunition out of the reach      of children.</em>    </p>    <p>      On a less grim note, the right knowledge at the right time      can be as valuable a safeguard as any weapon. Take first      aid training, or at least buy a manual and study it. Enroll      in civil defense courses on survival and emergency      preparedness. If you have the time and inclination, you      might even try an outdoor survival course or a field trip      series on foraging.    </p>    <p>      If you have trusted friends who feel as you do about the      need to prepare for difficult times, you might give thought      to working out a mutual assistance program. A word of      caution, though: It would be nice if everyone were honest .      . . but-as has been proven in hard times all through      history-some folks who suddenly find themselves in a      tight situation get desperate, throw character to the winds      and become downright savage. A hard-working Mormon family I      know had their food supply ripped off and I discovered      someone close to me planning the same thing. So be      sensitive and careful, and choose your companions well.    </p>        <h3>LONG-TERM FOOD SUPPLY</h3>      <p>      A year's food supply is the next priority . . . but before      you begin gathering your stock, you'll need someplace to      store it. This may be a retreat, root cellar, garage, house      or barn. Wherever the cache, it must be accessible and      secure against spoilage and oxidation, rodents, insects,      water damage and extremes of heat and cold. The best      temperature range is 55° to 65° F.    </p>    <p>      Storage containers must be tailored to the space available      and the type and amount of food. A secondary consideration      is convenient handling of the stored provisions for      consumption and stock rotation.    </p>    <p>      Most discount paint supply stores carry five-gallon round      and square metal cans (such as thinner is sold in), and      five-gallon lidded pails of the type used for paint and      asphalt. Locally these cost $1.75 to $2.00 each. Some      companies make a specialty of the same items in white      plastic-new and used-for about the same price.      Paint manufacturers will often sell brand-new one-gallon      metal coin. with friction lids, or will refer you to their      supplier.    </p>    <p>      Sears and Montgomery Ward both catalog a heat-sealing      device for use on heavy-duty poly bags. Institutions with      large cafeterias-schools, colleges, factories,      etc.-throw away gallon jars in both glass and      plastic. Used plastic jugs practically litter the      landscape.    </p>    <p>      Do not attempt to store food in any container that has held      petroleum products. The residue will ruin the smell and      taste of your stash . . . and may ruin you, too, if you eat      food stored in such a can or jar. Wheat and flour will      absorb petroleum odors even when the food is sealed in      plastic.    </p>    <p>      As you choose your food storage containers, remember that      rats and mice can and will chew rapidly through a plastic      bag or can to get at its contents, and that metal will      eventually rust. You can shellac a metal can to prevent the      rust, of course, but shellac often costs more than a new      container.    </p>    <p>      Weevils love soap residue, so-even if you don't use      detergent for dishes-it's a good idea to keep a small      amount of the soap substitute around for cleaning food      storage containers . . . after which you can get down to      filling them.    </p>    <p>      WHEAT should be the first staple put into storage, since      it's the most versatile and nutritious low-cost source of      protein and can be made into a meat substitute called      gluten. <em>(See</em> Passposrt to Survival <em>by Esther      Dickey-$3.95 from Bookcraft Publishers, 1848 West      2300 South, Salt Lake City, Utah 84120, or from MOTHERS      Bookshelf for instructions on the preparation and use of      gluten . . . and many other excellent survival food      recipes.-MOTHER.)</em> Three hundred pounds is an      average year's ration for an adult female. A grown man will      need about 100 pounds more per year and a child about 100      pounds less . . . so, if your males and children balance,      figure 300 pounds per person. Don't count on young children      remaining small, however. As their appetites grow, so      should their reserve food supply.    </p>    <p>      Hard winter wheat (Turkey Red) or hard spring wheat      (Marquis) is the best to store. It should be Grade 1, with      a protein content of 11.5% and less than 10% moisture.      Separate all foreign matter from the kernels and put the      grain into clean, dry containers.    </p>    <p>      I know a lady who lives in a dry area of California. Her      wheat storage system consists of a eucalyptus tree and a      row of 88 cents plastic garbage cans. She buys uncleaned      wheat at the feed store for 10 cents per pound, cleans it      herself by winnowing on a windy day and then spreads the      grain on an old window screen so she can pick out stones      and such. Next, she pours an empty can three-quarters full      of wheat, mixes in a double handful of eucalyptus leaves,      places the fresh container at the end of a line of six and      puts the lid on, weighting it with a gaily painted brick.      Then she takes the makings for bread, cereal, etc., from      Can No. 1 at the head of the line, thus rotating her      supply. Once a year this lady aerates any unused grain,      inspects it by pouring the kernels from one can to another      and adds fresh leaves. She swears they keep out the      weevils, and it certainly seems to work for her. I've heard      the same said for newly picked bay laurel leaves.    </p>    <p>      Another way to eliminate both insect eggs and      moisture-and a method that also works for beans,      peas, nuts, etc.-is to fill a shallow pan      three-quarters of an inch deep with whatever it is you're      storing and heat the food to 150° F for 20 minutes,      cool it and store it in an airtight container.    </p>    <p>      If you have to worry about rodents invading your food      stash, you can protect it as follows: Gad about to the      discard piles of any restaurants which serve deep-fat-fried      food and look for five-gallon metal cans with two-inch      openings (standard institutional packing for liquid      shortening). Note that such a container holds about      one-third hundredweight of wheat. That is, nine five-gallon      cans are needed for 300 pounds of the grain, an average      person's yearly supply.    </p>    <p>      Clean the containers well with hot soapy water so that no      trace of fat remains to go rancid in storage. A very good      way to do this is with five or six doses of hot sudsies      from the drain hose of a washing machine, if you have      access to one. (If you don't want to go through all this,      of course, you can just buy new cans.)    </p>    <p>      OK. Set out your cleaned cans and your cleaned wheat. Then      go and buy some dry ice. Drop a piece of the frozen carbon      dioxide the size of a walnut (or two crushed ounces) into      the bottom of each container and pour in about 33 pounds of      grain. Leave the lids sitting loosely on top of the cans      about 12 hours-or overnight-while the dry ice      evaporates into carbon dioxide (an inert gas which      displaces oxygen). Then screw the tops down tight <em>. . .      but be careful not to do this until evaporation is      complete, or the buildup of pressure will cause the cans to      explode.</em> If you notice any bulging containers, loosen      the lids at once to allow the gas to escape.    </p>    <p>      When you're finished with this process, your grain will be      well protected. No insect eggs will hatch without oxygen .      . . and, of course, no oxidation will take place either.    </p>    <p>      There's still another method for the long-term storage of      grains and legumes that might appeal to you. A bag of      diatomaceous earth-the fossil remains of one-cell      marine diatoms-may be purchased from a pool supply      firm and a handful tossed in with the food that is to be      stored . . . whatever the container (even plastic and paper      bags). Diatomaceous earth is a desiccant to insects and can      also be dusted carefully on animals to kill fleas and      mites, applied to plants in the garden for pest control and      used to reduce the fly and odor problem when disposing of      human or animal feces. It's non-toxic when ingested,      harmless to the environment and very inexpensive.    </p>    <p>      After you've learned how to store wheat, you may also have      to learn how to serve it. The grain can be sprouted, or      eaten as a grass . . . or it can be steamed or cooked in a      double boiler or pressure cooker-or even a thermos      jug-to make a good nutritious cereal. The addition of      a grain mill, however, raises your standard of survival      living by 500%. With grinding equipment handy you can have      flour for bread and gluten, cracked wheat, mush for babies,      the elderly or infirm . . . and so on. By all means, then,      keep a mill along with your hoard of grain and learn to use      it efficiently.    </p>    <p>      Of the several good makes available, I personally prefer      the Corona . . . manual, because the exercise is good for      me and I'm immune to loss of milling ability due to power      failure. Some electric grain mills are advertised as being      hand operable in case the electricity cuts out. I'm not      sure I'd want to be on the cranking end of such a      machine-grinding grain and turning a powerful motor      too-but I've never tried and may be wrong in assuming      that it's more difficult than operating my own model.      (Incidentally, see MOTHER NO. 7, pages 56-58, for a very      good article entitled "When You Own a Corona".)    </p>    <p>      <em>(EDITORS NOTE: We here at MOTHER preferred the Corona      too . . . until we discovered the Quaker City mill. It      looks almost identical to the Corona but has better      "innards" which crank much easier</em> and <em>which      produce a finer quality flour.)</em>    </p>    <p>      MILK is the second food to store. If your supply is canned,      the containers should be kept at a temperature of 40° F      and turned over every month or so to avoid or minimize fat      separation. The product will keep a year this way, but may      darken in color as the storage period lengthens. If the fat      does separate in a can, shake the container vigorously for      a few minutes before opening-or place the contents in      a jar and shake-to restore the milk to a      smooth-pouring, creamy consistency.    </p>    <p>      Powdered milk is somewhat easier to deal with for long-term      storage. It seems, though, that just the mention of the      stuff brings shouts and groans of protest from any group of      people. Of course the dried beverage doesn't compare with      fresh cows' or goats' milk, and I myself used to avoid it      like castor oil. But remember, we're talking about      <em>survival . . . and</em> we don't all have cows or      goats, especially any that are fresh year round. And milk,      even if you don't drink it, is essential to cooking and      baking.    </p>    <p>      There are two kinds of powdered milk. The first is fat-free      and-unless fortified-lacks the fat-soluble      vitamins A and D. When the product is kept dry and cool,      you can estimate its storage life at three to five years.    </p>    <p>      The other type is powdered whole milk with all the fat and      vitamins left in (important if you have a baby). The only      brand I've found in this category is Milkman. I was given a      sip by a fellow backpacker somewhere in the wilds of the      San Gabriel Mountains and thought the good taste was      perhaps due to fresh-air appetite . . . but when I sampled      the same thing at home, the flavor and low price convinced      me to use this brand exclusively. If you want to try my      favorite, it's available by mail order from several outdoor      outfitters.    </p>    <p>      Whole dried milk must be kept cool and used within one      year. If you drink milk anyway, however, it's no problem to      rotate your supply while keeping 12 months ahead. One good      plan is to use the dried product half and half with whole      milk. This ensures turnover and also stretches your budget.      Or the powder alone can be used in cooking, with very good      results. The trap to avoid is using your stock when you're      a little short of money. . . and then failing to replace      it.    </p>    <p>      Stored dried milk picks up odors very easily (no eucalyptus      leaves for this item!) and must at all costs be protected      from infiltration by moisture, which will alter or destroy      its flavor over a period of time. A practical amount of      milk to set aside is 100 pounds per person per year.    </p>    <p>      SALT-not a true food, but a mineral essential to      wellbeing-is third on the list of items to be stored.      About five pounds per person per year in temperate      climates, and as much as ten pounds in hot climates, will      do for table use in a survival situation.    </p>    <p>      Iodized or sea salt-depending on your budget-is      the preferred choice for personal use. An uniodized      version, however, is available in five-pound bags at      one-quarter the cost of regular salt. This product is very      coarse and suitable for pickling, salting and canning, but      may also be used as seasoning if you have another access to      iodine in your diet.    </p>    <p>      Packed in an airtight container and stored in a cool, dry      place, salt will keep for many years. (A slight yellowish      discoloration due to free iodine may take place in the      iodized product, but this is harmless.) A good technique is      to pour your stock into plastic gallon jugs, which will      usually hold about 12 pounds. Don't forget, though, that      little beasties will gnaw plastic to get the goodies inside      . . . and salt is certainly a goody.    </p>    <p>      HONEY is the last absolutely essential survival food. It's      the most desirable of the sweetening agents: the most      versatile and the best for you. Besides natural sugars and      beneficial enzymes, honey contains trace quantities of      vitamin C, protein and iron. It keeps indefinitely,      contains about 400 less calories per pound than sugar,      tastes twice as sweet, goes one-third farther . . . and,      unfortunately, is more expensive.    </p>    <p>      Bacteria cannot survive in pure crystalline honey, which is      the only kind worth storing. Don't throw away your money on      a processed, pasteurized or altered product, or one to      which water has been added. If your source is a      supermarket, read the labels carefully and remember that      grades refer to degrees of filtering. "Grade A Fancy"      indicates that the jar's contents have been filtered      through the finest screen. "Choice" is the least tampered      with.    </p>    <p>      If the temperature of your stored honey reaches or exceeds      75° F, the sweetening will lose some of its flavor and      color. Also, all pure, unprocessed honey will crystallize      no matter how it's kept. Some folks enjoy using it in that      form (it spreads like butter) . . . but if you want to      return crystallized honey to a liquid consistency you can      set the container of the sweetening in a pan of water and      heat it to 150°-180° F. It takes a long time to      liquefy a five-pound batch. Just write a letter or weed the      garden and stir the mess a bit now and then.    </p>    <p>      Honey is most conveniently kept, in half-gallon or in      five-pound cans. (It's a good idea to minimize the use of      glass in your food program lest breakage rob you of your      provisions and make an incredible mess.) If you choose to      store this sweetening in five-gallon containers-which      hold 60 pounds each-keep in mind that you'll probably      have to liquefy the whole canful every time you want to use      some of the contents. The average amount needed by an adult      is 60 to 100 pounds a year.    </p>     <h3>A PLACE TO GO</h3>       <p>      In closing, I'd like to mention a possibility for city      dwellers: to establish a hideaway in a remote area at least      250 miles from a large center such as Los Angeles, New      York, Dallas, Atlanta, New Orleans, etc .... or to arrange      a means of getting that far away should need arise. The      retreat may be anything from a car, van or microbus with      cardboard boxes of food, camping stove, water, clothes and      radio . . . to a well-stocked camper and a set of road maps      . . . to a rustic desert or woodland cabin . . . to a      full-time working homestead.    </p>    <p>      Whatever you want or can afford, make sure that it's as      comfortable as possible, that it's a solution you can live      with and that you can get there when times are rough. (Try      not to select a place you couldn't reach with your own,      average, on-hand supply of gas, for instance.) Take your      vacations at your hide-out, live with it, work the bugs out      of the system, make friends with the people, drive a well,      plant fruit trees. Perhaps you'd rather just move to a      small town. Do whatever makes you feel most secure.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, the survival program I've outlined will ensure      food and water for any likely crisis or disaster . . . in a      form that's compact to store and nutritionally adequate and      at a minimum cost of $50 to $150 per person. If you follow      the suggestions given here in the proper sequence, you'll      find yourself better prepared and more confident about the      future than you ever thought possible.    </p>
