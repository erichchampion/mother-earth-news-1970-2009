    <p>
                        <p>      Take the chill off autumn evenings with a rich, meaty stew.    </p>    			    <p>      ON WEEKENDS WE SLEEP LATER, move slower, breathe deeper. We      catch up with small chores, with last week's newspapers,      with each other. We have time for food that can't be      hurried: for bread that needs to rise, meat that needs to      marinate, stews that need to simmer. And we have all      afternoon to savor the rich, warm aromas that fill the      house.    </p>    <p>      Stews are not fast food, at least not in their initial      preparation. Because the meat must flavor a large volume of      liquid, it needs to cook longer than is strictly required      for doneness. But recipes can be doubled and the extra      portions refrigerated or frozen, then reheated quickly on a      fast-paced weeknight. Since most stews improve after      sitting awhile, complaints about leftovers are rare.    </p>    <p>      Anyone who can boil water can add some meat and vegetables      and end up with a stew. Of course, boiling hasn't always      been so easy. While some prehistoric cook could have      discovered the process of roasting by accidentally dropping      a piece of meat in the fire, hot water is rare in nature.      Since producing it requires containers that are both      heatproof and waterproof, archaeologists long assumed that      the stewing of food had to await the invention of pottery.      But it now appears that humans boiled food earlier, in the      shells of tortoises, turtles and large mollusks, or by      digging a hole, lining it with overlapping flat rocks and      clay to prevent leakage, filling it with water, and      dropping in stones heated in the fire. As the food cooked,      more hot rocks were added to keep the temperature high.    </p>    <p>      These days, boiling is so basic a skill that the inability      to do it is the hallmark of culinary incompetence. ("I      don't know how he survives; he can't even boil water.")      And, in fact, timing and temperature control are less      important than in baking and frying. Oil, for example, can      vary widely and dangerously in temperature; maintaining an      even heat requires a good thermometer and constant      attention. On the other hand, water boils at 212°F, and      no matter how long or how hard it boils, it will never get      any hotter. (Actually, the boiling point may vary by a      degree or two with passing high- or low-pressure fronts,      and it drops about two degrees for every 1,000 feet of      elevation above sea level. But the principle that the      boiling point is the peak temperature remains true.) In      short, it's hard to burn a stew without evaporating all the      liquid in the pot-which requires remarkable negligence or      spectacular distractions.    </p>    <p>      As food scientist Harold McGee has pointed out, the heat      threshold of water explains why the first step in stew      making is to brown some of the ingredients in oil. The      molecular chain reaction we know as browning, which      produces rich, intense flavors, is triggered at about      310°F. With a maximum temperature of 212°, boiled      food will remain forever pale and bland. Meat, flour, and      vegetables such as onion and garlic should be browned in      hot fat before any liquid is added to the pan and      effectively stops the browning process. If browning is done      in a separate frying pan, the skillet should be deglazed      with some of the stewing liquids, to get all the rich      flavors. ("Deglazing" means transferring the meat and      vegetables to the stewpot, adding some stewing liquid to      the frying pan, scraping up any brown bits remaining on the      bottom, then pouring the liquid into the stewpot.)    </p>    <p>      The recipes that follow are based on a variety of      meats-beef, pork, chicken, lamb and wild game. All will      provide warm, hearty fare for cool weekend nights.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Cider Stew</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      3 tablespoons flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/4 teaspoon      pepper 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 2 pounds stew beef, cut      into 2-inch cubes 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 cups apple      cider 1/2 cup water 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 medium      onions, sliced 3 medium potatoes, peeled and thickly sliced      4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into logs 1 rib celery,      sliced 3 medium parsnips, scraped and sliced, or 1 turnip,      peeled and coarsely chopped 1/4 cup chopped parsley    </p>    <p>      Mix flour, salt, pepper and thyme on a plate. Dredge meat      in seasoned flour. Heat oil in large kettle or Dutch oven.      Working in batches, brown meat thoroughly. Drain off fat,      then return meat to pan. Add cider, water and vinegar,      scraping up any bits which have stuck to bottom of pan.      Cover, bring to a boil, then simmer about 1 1/4 hours or      until meat is almost tender. Add onions, potatoes, carrots,      celery and parsnips. Cover and simmer another 30 minutes or      until vegetables are tender. Sprinkle in parsley, stir      well, and serve. Serves 6.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Chicken Peanut Stew</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      This stew, of African origin, does not keep well, so make      enough just to eat the day it is made.    </p>    <p>      2 chickens, cut into pieces* 3/4 cup peanut oil** 2 large      onions, chopped 1/4 cup tomato paste 2-3 tomatoes, peeled      and coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup peanut butter 1      small cabbage, chopped 3 sweet potatoes, cut into chunks 6      carrots, cut up 6 turnips, cut up 12 okra, cut up 1 chile      pepper, or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne    </p>    <p>      Brown chicken in hot oil in large, heavy pot. Add half the      onion and stir until golden brown. Thin tomato paste with      about half a cup of water, and add paste and tomatoes to      pot.    </p>    <p>      Boil 4 cups water, and pour that into pot as well, along      with salt. While mixture boils gently, thin peanut butter      with some of the hot pot liquid and stir it in gradually.      Reduce heat and simmer for half an hour. Then begin adding      the vegetables, letting each simmer for 5 minutes or so      before putting in the next one. Cook until chicken and all      vegetables are tender.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, crush or grind the second onion with the pepper.      Add during last 10 minutes of cooking.    </p>    <p>      *If desired, chicken may be skinned and cut from the bone,      for easier eating.    </p>    <p>      **Our test cook halved the amount of oil, with good      results.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Beer-Drinkers' Stew</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Alaskan Gordon R. Nelson explains the origin of his recipe:      "This is a peppy but not overpowering stew that requires      plenty of cold beer. The friend who first served it to me      also made the beer we drank. On the morning of the third      day I spent at his house, he sobered up long enough to      scratch the stew recipe on a paper sack, just before I      caught a plane home. He didn't name it, so I did my best."    </p>    <p>      3 pounds stew meat (moose, venison, beef, what-have-you),      cut into 1-inch cubes 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 1      tablespoon lime juice (lemon's OK too, what the heck) 1      tablespoon chili powder 1 12-ounce can V-8 juice 2      tablespoons salad oil 2 cups thinly sliced onions 1/4-ounce      can green chiles 2 cloves garlic, minced fine 1 tablespoon      fresh ginger, minced 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 1/2      teaspoons salt 1 15ounce can tomatoes    </p>    <p>      Combine vinegar, lime juice, chili powder and V-8 juice in      bowl. Add meat and marinate 20 minutes. Stir occasionally.    </p>    <p>      Heat oil in large frying pan or Dutch oven, and saute      onions, chiles and garlic over low heat. When onions are      translucent, add ginger, turmeric and salt. Mix well and      add tomatoes, breaking them with a spoon. Next add meat and      marinade to the pan and simmer, stirring often, 1 1/2      hours. Add water if more liquid is necessary. When meat is      tender, the stew is done.    </p>    <p>      Serve straight from the pan to deep bowls, accompanied by      hard rolls and beer. Serves 6. With beer!    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Brunswick Stew</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      2 medium chickens, cut up<br />      2 pounds beef shin bones 1 ham bone 1 squirrel, cut up 3      quarts water 1/2 cup sugar 1 bay leaf 1 teaspoon dried      basil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 2 onions, sliced      4 cups peeled, chopped fresh tomatoes (or 2 1-pound cans) 2      cups chopped celery with tops 2 cups butter beans or baby      limas 4 large potatoes, peeled and cut up 2 cups cut okra 4      cups corn 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter 1 pod red pepper,      crushed, or 1/4-1/2 teaspoon crushed 1 teaspoon black      pepper Salt to taste    </p>    <p>      In large soup kettle, combine chickens, beef bones, ham      bone, squirrel, water, sugar, bay leaf, basil and parsley.      Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer until meat falls      from bones (2 hours or so). Remove bones and meat from      broth, and set aside to cool. To the pot add onions,      tomatoes, celery, beans and potatoes.Cook over low heat      until vegetables are tender, about another 45 minutes to an      hour, stirring frequently. When meat is cool, remove from      bones and cut into pieces. Add to stew, then add corn and      okra. Simmer until tender, then stir in butter, red pepper      and black pepper, adding salt to taste. Stir constantly for      15 minutes or until mixture is thick and mushy. Serves 10.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Green Chile Stew With      Pork</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Jeff Smith, better known as "the Frugal Gourmet," put this      recipe together from memory, in an attempt to duplicate a      Pueblo stew he and his wife, Patty, were particularly fond      of. "Patty and I serve this with a big green salad and a      pile of wheat tortillas," he says. "Then we take the      telephone off the hook!"    </p>    <p>      3 pounds boneless pork, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 3      tablespoons peanut oil 3 stalks celery, chopped 2 medium      tomatoes, diced 7 green chiles, roasted, peeled and      chopped* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed    </p>    <p>      Homemade chicken stock or canned chicken broth or water to      cover (not bouillon) Salt to taste La Victoria brand salsa      jalapeno (if you dare)    </p>    <p>      Brown pork in oil, doing so in 2 or 3 batches. (If you have      one, use a large black frying pan so the meat will brown      quickly.) Place the meat in a 3- or 4-quart covered oven      casserole, and add celery, tomatoes, chiles and garlic.      Deglaze frying pan with chicken broth or water and add to      the pot. Barely cover the ingredients with chicken broth or      water. Broth may make this too rich for you, so you might      try just water or half of each. Cover and simmer until stew      is thick and the meat very tender, about 1'/z hours. Add      salt to taste before serving. If the stew is not hot enough      for you, add a bit of La Victoria salsa jalapeno. This is      wonderful, but be careful. It's hot!    </p>    <p>      Pueblo tradition calls for the addition of corn or potatoes      to this dish, but many people prefer it without. It makes a      wonderful filling for enchiladas.    </p>    <p>      *To roast chile peppers, place whole pepper directly on gas      burner on high heat, or place as close as possible to hot      broiler. Roast until pepper is blistered and blackened,      then wrap in damp paper towel for 10 minutes. Slip skin off      by pulling downward from the stem end. Scrape off any      remaining black specks with a paring knife.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Irish Stew</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      This traditional dish consists of layers of lamb, potatoes      and onions; the layers mix when you ladle out a serving.    </p>    <p>      6 medium potatoes, peeled and thickly sliced 3 large      onions, peeled and sliced 3 pounds lean boneless lamb      shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes 3 tablespoons chopped fresh      parsley 1 teaspoon dried thyme Salt and pepper to taste      Water to cover    </p>    <p>      In a large, ovenproof casserole, arrange half the potatoes      in a layer, and cover with half the onions. Add all the      lamb pieces, and sprinkle with seasonings. Add the      remaining onions, and top with the rest of the potatoes.      Season with salt and pepper, and add water to cover. Cover      and bake at 300° F for 2 to 2'/2 hours or until meat is      tender. Serves 6.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Rabbit and Wine Stew</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons oil<br /> 1 2 1/2 - or 3-pound rabbit, cleaned and      cut up<br /> Salt and pepper to taste<br /> 1 pound mushrooms <br />1 pound      small white onions<br /> 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic<br /> 1 1/2      cups red wine<br /> 1/2cup chicken stock<br /> 1 tablespoon tomato      paste <br />2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley <br />1/2 teaspoon      dried thyme<br /> 1 bay leaf    </p>    <p>      Heat oil in large saucepan or Dutch oven. Sprinkle rabbit      pieces with salt and pepper, and brown lightly on all      sides. Drain off fat and add mushrooms, onions and garlic;      cook about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add remaining      ingredients, bring to boil, and simmer about 45 minutes, or      until rabbit is tender. Serves 4.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Mulligatawny Stew</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      2 medium onions,<br /> sliced 1/2 cup carrots, sliced <br />1/2 cup      celery, sliced<br /> 3 tablespoons butter<br /> 1 3 1/2- to 4-pound      chicken, cut up <br />1 cup yogurt <br />1 tablespoon curry powder<br /> 1      clove garlic, minced<br /> 1 teaspoon turmeric <br />2 teaspoons salt<br /> 2      quarts water <br />1/2 cup coconut, to garnish    </p>    <p>      In large stewpot, saute onions, carrots and celery in      butter until translucent. Add chicken and cook about 20      minutes, turning the pieces occasionally until they turn a      golden brown. Stir in yogurt, curry powder, garlic,      turmeric and salt, and cook another 20 minutes. (Be      careful; the yogurt mixture can burn, so stir now and then,      and lower the heat, if needed.) Add water, cover, and      simmer 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.    </p>    <p>      Remove chicken pieces from the pot, pull the meat off the      bones, cut it into bite-size chunks, and return them to the      pot. Reheat stew if necessary. Garnish each serving with a      sprinkle of coconut. Serve with boiled rice, if desired.      Serves 8.    </p>    <p>      CIDER STEW RECIPE FROM FARMERS MARKET COOK BOOK.
