                <p>      <strong>SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</strong>    </p>        <p>      Hot news from the horticultural front.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>        <p>      THE ONGOING SEARCH FOR AN anti-AIDS drug leads scientists      down some bizarre trails. One current path of research      involves an Australian rain forest tree, the Moreton Bay      chestnut. Laboratory tests at the National Cancer Institute      show that castanospermine, a chemical extracted from the      tree's seeds, prevents the AIDS virus from killing healthy      cells.    </p>    <p>      At the same time, Dr. James A. Duke, a botanist with the      USDA's Agricultural Research Service, is trying to raise      the exotic chestnut (it's actually a legume) as an      ornamental houseplant. "The plant looks somewhat like the      popular Benjamin fig except the leaves are slightly larger      and glossier," Duke says. It does well under fluorescent      lights, needs little maintenance and will grow about six      feet high in a container. (It can tower over 100 feet in      its native environment.)    </p>    <p>      Assuming that both the NCI anti-AIDS testing and Dr. Duke's      container-training efforts continue to go well, will home      gardeners start raising AIDS remedies on their windowsills?      Will there be a rush for Moreton Bay seeds, similar to the      peach pit collecting craze back when Laetrile was touted as      a cancer cure? Not likely, according to Duke. "The seed      should not be chewed because it contains toxins in its      natural state. The castanospermine is extracted by water      and purified with chromatography."    </p>    <p>      Oh, well. Still, you have to admit that having the source      of a possible anti-AIDS drug posing graciously in your home      would be a great conversation piece!    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Research Briefs</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Try tea and see.</strong> Don't throw out used tea      bags-tear them open and spread the contents around garden      plants! Tea leaves contain triacontanol and, according to      Indian chemists, very tiny amounts of this potent      plant-growth stimulator in the soil can produce significant      increases in crop yields.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wile E. Melon.</strong> The midnight munchers in      your melon patch might not be raccoons. Commercial melon      growers as far east as Mississippi have lost several      thousand dollars' worth of their melons to coyotes!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Young seed potatoes</strong> . If you're going to      save some potatoes for next year's seed tubers, harvest      those spuds early-even before the plants die. "Young" seed      potatoes tend to produce higher yields of larger, better      quality tubers. (Exception: If your growing season is quite      short, pick your seed spuds from more mature tubers. Young      seed potatoes need a longer growing season than old ones.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Great glistening whiteflies!</strong> Low-toxic      horticultural oils (including "dormant oils") are often      used to control insect and mite pests on outdoor crops.      Recent research by the Agency for International Development      indicates they work well indoors, as well. Concentrations      of 1-207o Sunspray 6E (made by the Sun Oil Company)      controlled greenhouse infestations of whiteflies, spider      mites and leaf miners.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Saltwater tomatoes.</strong> Israeli scientists      have produced significantly better-tasting tomatoes by      irrigating the plants with diluted seawater. However, since      <em>season-long</em> saline irrigation also reduces yields,      the researchers apply the salt treatment only after many of      the fruits have begun to form. A 3 dS/m solution works best      (consult your local extension agent to learn how to concoct      it).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Strung-out deer.</strong> Kentucky wildlife deer      specialist John Phillips reports that a double fencing of      plain string will keep deer out of <em>relatively      small</em> areas. A three-strand, yard high outer fence is      set about one yard away from a one-strand, yard-high inner      one.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Gleanings</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Landscaping for Wildlife</em> ($8.45 postpaid from      Minnesota Documents Division, 117 University Ave., St.      Paul, MN 55155) is far and away the finest book we've seen      on the subject....
