                    		<h5 id="byline"> By Pat Stone</h5>    <p>      When this year's holidays arrive, share these lovely      keepsakes.    </p>    <p>      [GARLIC BRAIDING BY THE NUMBERS]    </p>       <p>      THE SURPRISING NIP OF a morning chill, the first fallen      leaves and yellowed vines, the subtle shortening of evening      light-all are phrases in nature's announcement of the end      of the season. While harvesting still-thriving tomatoes and      bouquets, the home grower heeds the message-knows that      fresh flowers and fruits will soon be things of the past      and yearns to save a few mementos of garden life to warm      the long winter months ahead.    </p>    <p>      It can be done. Simple yet striking garlic      braids...decorative wreaths bursting with colorful dried      flowers...harvest-symbol corn hangings...and straw hats      gaily decked with blooms are four souvenirs of summer that      you can put together easily at home. These craft creations      can brighten your winter hearth or be given away as      presents. (They can also be sold to bring in a little extra      pre-holiday income.) And you can gather virtually all the      materials you need from your own garden or by foraging from      nearby fields or lots.    </p>    <p>      Olivia Abel and Susan Sides, MOTHER's gardeners past and      present, have made these growers' gifts every fall for      years. With their help, and that of Kathy Askew (a local      craftswoman whose dried flower wreaths are shown in the      photograph), we'll share the secrets that will make your      own garden as "giftworthy" as theirs.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Maize Decorations</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Hung at the doorway or inside the home, ornamental dried      corn clusters are signs of harvest fertility-preserved      tributes to the fields and garden. The traditional      ornaments bespeak a household grateful for nature's bounty.    </p>    <p>      Maize decorations (as Susan likes to call them) are the      simplest to make of the four crafts presented here. They're      fashioned from field corn or popcorn since, unlike sweet      corn, these varieties are normally dried. Seed companies      generally list their colorful hard corns under such      headings as Indian, ornamental, calico or multicolored.    </p>    <p>      Don't harvest the corn until it has dried thoroughly. Then      store the ears-away from the elements and varmints-until      you're ready to work. (If you'll be storing them for more      than a month, spread the ears out one layer thick instead      of piling them in heaps.)    </p>    <p>      To begin each maize decoration, peel back, but don't      remove, the husks. Then stack three ears together pyramid      fashion: two on the bottom and one on top. Tie them      together, where the husks and cobs meet, with stout string      or pliable wire.    </p>    <p>      While the cluster is decorative as is, Susan often adds      dried flowers, seedpods, grass stalks or feathers for an      extra touch. She gathers many of the wild materials in the      fall. She also grows several of the flowers she uses dried,      such as acroclinium, globe amaranth, statice, strawflower,      scabiosa (or starflower), nigella and celosia. Dried blooms      or foliage from such herbs as artemesia, chives, lavender,      tansy, blue spire sage and emerald sage can also be put to      good use. (Remember, most flowers will last longer if      harvested before they're fully open. They also dry best if      hung in bunches upside down.)    </p>    <p>      Susan first arranges each bouquet of decorations in her      hand, then ties the bundle together with light string or a      length of ribbon (with a bow) and binds it to the corn      ears. When she plans to give the decoration as a gift, she      often attaches a card telling a little bit about that      particular type of corn, how it's grown and how to use it      in the form of cornmeal. She might even include a jar of      hand-ground meal made from extra ears.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Dried-Flower Straw Hats</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Hats decked with flowers add splashes of spring and summer      color to their wearers, bringing to mind summerfests,      picnics in the meadow and Maypoles. Consequently, they make      very popular gifts, both for wearing and for adorning      walls. They're lucrative craft items, as well. Kathy Askew      asks around $20 per hat. (In comparison, maize decorations      generally sell for $5 to $12.)    </p>    <p>      You can buy the hats themselves at import stores, dime      stores and flea markets. (Perhaps a local craft-supply      outlet can direct you to a wholesaler if you want to buy in      bulk.) Buy only hats with tight weaves and solidly made      rims, so they'll be less likely to fray or lose shape.    </p>    <p>      Your goal will be to add a band of summer color to each hat      by overlapping small clumps of flowers or foliage all the      way around, leaving no trailing stems to show. You may want      to first put down a layer of background material such as      Spanish moss, lamb's ears or artemesia. Susan's      particularly fond of the artemesias Silver King and Silver      Queen, since their fullness and silvery gray color make for      a wonderful background, and they can be woven round hats      (and wreaths) when freshly cut and pliable, then allowed to      dry in place.    </p>    <p>      Many wild garnerings such as rabbit tobacco, mints, grass      heads, Queen Anne's lace and various seedpods can be used      to decorate the hats. The same homegrown flowers and herbs      used to garnish corn hangings also work quite well.    </p>    <p>      To attach this dried bounty, some people sew clusters to a      ribbon and then glue or sew that band to the hat. Others      stitch the flowers directly in place. These methods are      slow, but fine for decorating an occasional hat. To speed      up the whole process, use a hot-glue gun (available at      craft-supply, hardware or department stores). Squeeze the      trigger on this electric tool, and the end of the glue      stick at its tip begins to melt. Starting at any point      around the hat base, you can apply a quarter-sized dab of      hot glue, attach a few decorative sprigs, shoot another dab      of glue, add more foliage and so on.    </p>    <p>      A hot-glue gun is easy to use and its adhesive dries      quickly. But watch out: The tip and adhesive get      dangerously hot. Be especially careful never to leave one      unattended around children-it looks a lot like a toy!    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Dried Wreaths</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Straw wreaths decorated with dried blooms make rings of      beautifully subtle colors-just what the gardener ordered to      banish doldrums from the winter home. They also offer a      wide choice of patterns and hues for creative crafting. And      they can be made with many of the same foraged and grown      adornments that are used on corn hangings and straw hats.    </p>    <p>      You can probably buy the wreath foundations at a local      craft-supply shop for about a dollar each. Olivia Abel      often makes hers, using a homemade form-a wooden board with      eight to ten dowels arranged in a circle-to help shape the      rounds. (You can, instead, hold a dinner plate up to your      work as a guide.)    </p>    <p>      To make a wreath foundation, tightly bunch a handful of hay      and start coiling string or thin wire (Olivia's choice)      around it. Add hay as you go, looping the wire close and      tight so the wreath won't break anywhere. Once you've      worked your way around to form a complete circle, wrap it      an extra time or two to provide reinforcement. Then tie the      wire off and use scissors or pruning shears to clip off all      the loose straw ends that poke out. The foundation-making      process takes about 10 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Most of Olivia's wreaths are about one foot across. You can      make yours larger if you wish, but be forewarned: Wreaths      use much more decorative foliage and flowers than do maize      decorations or straw hats, so it's easy to run out of      material.    </p>    <p>      Now comes the fun part. Figure out the patterns and flowers      you want to use, then start tying a bunch of flowers on      with wire (not string) wrapped around the stems. Once your      first clump is secure, lay a second one down so it covers      up the first group's stems, and bind that in place.      Continue laying flowers over stems all the way around. When      you reach the end, tuck some stiff=stemmed flowers under      the first batch, completely hiding the wire and stems. (If      you want to make a lot of wreaths, forget the wire. Follow      Kathy Askew's lead and attach the flowers with that      ever-useful aid, the glue gun.)    </p>    <p>      Olivia's favorite wreath pattern consists of one      mild-colored plant as background, highlighted by five or      six clusters of bright flowers. Another common pattern is      the "crazy quilt," where you run a continuous series of      clusters-each in a single color-all the way around. Susan      sometimes makes an outer ring of one color and texture and      an inner ring of another.    </p>    <p>      Kathy Askew (who sells her wreaths for anywhere from $10 to      $48) has even more creative ideas. She'll weave a circle of      grapevines and lushly foliate only the lower third of it.      The result? A "basket wreath." Or she'll build a small      heart-shaped wreath by tying two clumps of hay together at      the bottom, wiring up the two sides, bending the tops in      and then binding them in the middle. She'll totally cover      its front with loose petals and leaves left over from other      efforts. The whole is topped off with a bow for a gay      valentine effect.    </p>    <p>      Choice materials for wreath backgrounds (be creative!)      include German statice, baby's breath, lamb's ears, tansy,      pearly everlasting, goldenrod, joe-ye weed, ironweed, white      yarrow, hydrangea, foraged plumes and sumac. Strawflower,      statice, acroclinium, globe amaranth, errant, celosia,      golden yarrow and nigella provide attractive highlights.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Garlic Braids</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      The lovingly laced strands of a garlic braid hanging in the      kitchen are a sight that strikes the senses, evoking the      rich smells and pungent tastes of meals to come. This      cook's delight also is the most useful of the garden      craftings presented here, because-if you can bear to      disassemble it-you'll eventually use it all up. (Or you      might plant the cloves next spring and grow an abundance of      braid makings.)    </p>    <p>      To make one braid, you'll need at least 15 or 16 homegrown      and partly dried garlic bulbs, complete with tops. Pick      ones that have long stems and are all about the same size.      Then clean them by rubbing off the dirty outer skin layers      and clipping off any root hairs.    </p>    <p>      You'll start with three bulbs and add one more at a time as      you braid-a technique called French braiding. Work tightly      and neatly, making three distinct rows of bulbs as you go.      Follow the accompanying step-by-step drawings. But don't      let the directions throw you off-this is a lot easier to do      than to explain.    </p>    <p>      Keep fumbling along even if you lose track of what you're      doing-the braid almost always looks good in the end. When      you're done, tie the remaining stem ends together with      string. Hang the braid-stems up-on a hook in the kitchen      and take bulbs off from the top as needed. The garlic      should stay fresh for a year or more.    </p>    <p>      You can go on to adorn your garlic braids with dried      strawflowers, statice, celosia, cayenne peppers, golden      yarrow, marjoram, oregano or thyme. Such highlights can      fill in gaps, but don't clutter up the basic beauty of the      braid itself. To add strawflowers, run a thin, green      26-gauge wire (available from hobby shops) through each      bloom from below, bend the tip of the wire, and pull it      back down to hook into the head. (Do this the first week      after you harvest the flowers, before they get too dry and      brittle.) You can either wire your cayenne peppers or run      strings through them with a needle.    </p>    <p>      It takes about 30 to 45 minutes to make one garlic braid      (that includes cleaning the bulbs). They can be sold at      craft shows, flea markets and roadside stands for about $12      (plain braids) to $16 (fancy ones).    </p>    <p>      By the way, if you don't have enough homegrown garlic to      make your own braids this fall, now is the best time to      plant some so you'll have plenty of big bulbs next year.      Fall planting is one of the three keys to a good garlic      crop. Set individual cloves an inch deep and five inches      apart in well-drained soil fertilized with compost or aged      (not raw) manure. The other two keys are good weeding (you      can pretty much avoid that tedious task by mulching your      new planting with a two-inch layer of leaves) and regular,      thorough watering.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Preserve the Season</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      The time is ripe, in this lull between the hectic days of      garden toil just past and the harried holiday season to      come, to create this quartet of natural craftings. In the      process, you'll be capturing and sharing some of the      essence of summer's beauty to be enjoyed by others for      seasons to come.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>GARLIC BRAIDING BY THE      NUMBERS</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Illustrations By Kay Holmes Stafford    </p>		 		    <p>      [Top]    </p>
