        	        <h5 id="byline">      by Nancy Bubel    </h5>		<hr />    <p>      You're on your way from here to there-or perhaps      living on the road for a stretch, so that "home" <em>is      here,</em> wherever you are-or camping for fun or      from need or for a chance to sort things out . . . or      you're cruising an area in depth, looking for a homestead.    </p>        <p>      You have the nomad's life pretty well worked out . . .      except, that is, for a lingering uncertainty about the      food. It isn't just that you want to avoid the greasy spoon      cafes along the route. (You can get hepatitis in other ways      too, after all.) No, it's more than that. You'd like to be      able to gypsy around without depending so much on canned,      prepackaged or "plasticated" store groceries. You wish you      could have more Real Food while on the road. How can you      swing it?    </p>    <p>      Well, friends, this isn't exactly the final answer sheet on      How To Enjoy Real Foods While Traveling . . . because we're      still feeling our way along that path, too. But we      <em>are</em> discovering a few tricks that work, and here's      what we've come up with so far.    </p>    <h3>FOODS WE TAKE</h3>    <p>      First, a peek into our supply box, which contains the      things we assemble and pack before leaving . . . since they      must be either specially prepared or bought at certain      places:    </p>    <p>      [1] Herb teas, both dried at home and bought through the      mail. They're light, take up minimum space (they'll squoosh      into almost any corner) and the children can enjoy these      drinks too.    </p>    <p>      [2] Honey, one jar to start with. We can buy this just      about anywhere.    </p>    <p>      [3] Homemade bread, two frozen loaves. More than that would      turn green before we had a chance to eat them.    </p>    <p>      [4] Cornmeal (stone-ground, yellow).    </p>    <p>      [5] Whole-wheat, stone-ground flour . . . for breading fish      and for pancakes and other baking.    </p>    <p>      [6] Peanuts in the shell. With milk and fruit, these are a      meal.    </p>    <p>      [7] Peanut butter (made the right way by whizzing up      nothing but the nuts-and maybe a touch of sea      salt-in a blender).    </p>    <p>      [8] Dried fruit, unsulfurized.    </p>    <p>      [9] Sunflower seeds.    </p>    <p>      [10] Soybeans, dried.    </p>    <p>      [11] Mung beans, dried.    </p>    <p>      [12] As many of our garden vegetables and as much of our      own goat's milk as we can squeeze in, to give us a good      running start. Such provisions are worth taking an extra      cooler for, if there's room.    </p>    <p>      [ 13] Food yeast, a superb source of protein and B      vitamins.    </p>    <p>      We use either of two kinds of yeast available from Plus      Products, 1648 St. Clair Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114.      (This firm doesn't send you a catalog every month and a      half, by the way, which kinda makes me respect their      seriousness about the whole nutrition business.)    </p>        <p>      Plus Formula 250-Yeast Plus-offers B vitamins      in the proper ratio for the body's requirements . . . for      example, 131, B2 and B6 occur in equal amounts. All      B-vitamin or multivitamin preparations should observe this      proportion (though, unfortunately, most of them don't);      otherwise, subtle nutritional deficiencies can occur      because a high intake of one of the B group requires      complementary amounts of the others for correct metabolism.      For this reason, food yeast, wheat germ and other natural      sources of these vital substances are to be preferred to      one-shot doses of isolated elements of the B complex or to      out-of-balance super capsules. Just like the ferns in the      woods, the members of this nutritional family don't grow      alone. <em>[See Adelle Davis,</em> Let's Eat Right To Keep      Fit, <em>for more information.-MOTHER.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Formula 450 from Plus Products has a correct balance of B      vitamins and is instantized as well. Moreover, this      supplement is specially grown on molasses and is palatable      . . . rather than just bearable, as regular food yeasts      tend to be.    </p>    <p>      We put our yeast (we call it "fuel") in a small shaker jar      and keep it available at every meal. The powder combines      very well with Chinese foods, with all tomato dishes and      with the goulash-type mixtures that are likely to be      produced over a campfire. The children use it voluntarily      and often with gusto . . . which is more than I can say for      some of the other super supplements we've tried. We might      forget the can opener and not worry, but if the food yeast      is left behind, we'd have to turn back to get it. That's      how much we depend on our "fuel".    </p>    <h3>FOODS WE MAKE</h3>   <p>      Here are four kinds of Real Food that can be made while      movin' on. Come to think of it, if you put them all      together you'll have a meal. Then throw in a little fishing      and/or foraging and you'll have a feast on your hands.    </p>    <h3>CORN CHIPS</h3>   <p>      1 cup yellow, stone-ground cornmeal<br />      1 Tbs. fat (lard, oil or butter)<br />      7/8 cup boiling water<br />      Dash of salt (if desired)    </p>    <p>      Mix the ingredients well, let them cool slightly and pat      the dough into very thin rounds on a cooky sheet, a piece      of foil or a frying pan. Bake the chips over the campfire,      turning them once and removing them when they're crisp and      brown.    </p>    <h3>YOGURT</h3>     <p>      Sure, you can make yogurt on the road. Just keep your      starter going and-as suggested by Lizbeth in MOTHER      NO. 9, pg. 96-use an insulated cooler to keep the      temperature constant once the milk has been heated and      cooled to the proper 110° to 115° F incubating      point. As I'm sure you've already discovered, yogurt plus      fruit equals a marvelously refreshing meal.    </p>        <h3>ENGLISH MUFFINS</h3>     <p>      Oh, yes, you can!    </p>    <p>      1 package active dry yeast softened in 1/4 cup water<br />      3/4 cup scalded milk (cooled to lukewarm)<br />      1 /4 cup shortening (melted and cooled to lukewarm<br />      1 Tbs. honey<br />      egg (optional)<br />      1 tsp. salt<br />      3 cups whole-wheat flour<br />      About 1/2 cup cornmeal    </p>    <p>      Add the lukewarm oil (test on your wrist!) to the lukewarm      milk. Add the honey, egg and salt to this mixture, stir      them and then add the softened yeast. Now stir in about      half the flour. Then knead in the rest of the flour . . .      or, if kneading is inconvenient, just punch the dough      around in the bowl a bit. Lightness of texture is less      important in these muffins than in bread, but manipulation      does develop the gluten that is necessary for good rising.    </p>    <p>      Pat out the finished dough on a floured surface to a      thickness of about 1/2 inch. Cut it into rounds with a cup      or jar top, and let them rise for about one hour. Sprinkle      cornmeal in a frying pan or on a griddle (add more as      needed to keep the dough from sticking) and bake the      muffins a few at a time-or as many as will      fit-for seven minutes on each side. Before serving,      toast them over the fire or in a pan.    </p>    <p>      I always double this recipe. Ain't no sense in just      tantalizing people!    </p>    <h3>SPROUTS</h3>    <p>      What kind? All kinds . . . mung beans, alfalfa, wheat,      peas, sunflower seeds, oats, radishes. Use untreated seeds,      of course. They're easily found in stores that offer whole      foods, or you can raise your own.    </p>    <p>      As you know, seeds are packed with life power and      many-poppy, caraway, sunflower, sesame, peanuts,      beans, peas and soybeans-are good to eat in their own      right.    </p>    <p>      When you sprout these little food packages, though, the      growth curve of available C and B vitamins can really go      out of sight. Seeds, cheap to begin with (mung beans are      67 cents a pound from Walnut Acres), become a really      fabulous bargain in the process of germination; one pound      of seeds produces six to eight pounds of tasty little      tendrils. All you add is air, water and darkness.    </p>    <p>      To grow a quart of sprouts-just right to "Chinese" a      small joint of chicken for a family of five-here's      what to do: Put a handful of mung beans in a canning jar      and top the container with wire screening or nylon net held      on by the jar ring. Cover the seeds with 1-1/2 cups of      water, and let them soak in a dark place overnight. Next      morning drain off the liquid (save it for making breads or      soups), and again set the jar away from the light. Darkness      keeps the sprouts tender and promotes higher vitamin C      content. Rinse them in cool water twice a day, and drain      them well each time. Your crop will be ready in two or      three days in warm weather and in four or five days during      a cold period.    </p>    <p>      If you keep two jars going you'll always have fresh, live      vegetables while on the road or in the woods, and your can      opener will grow rusty and arthritic. Let it! Even if      you're biking, you can find room for a pound of seeds . . .      they won't let you down.    </p>    <p>      The output of your mobile mini-gardens can be used in many      ways: fresh, in salads; cooked with scrambled eggs; mixed      with any meats and other vegetables to make exotic dishes      you can let the children name; steamed, briefly, in tomato      sauce; dropped into pancake batter; or served in soup . . .      slightly cooked or added at the last minute.    </p>    <p>      For more on sprouting, see <em>Feel Like A Million!</em> by      Catharyn Elwood, published by Pocket Books and available      for 95 cents.    </p>    <h3>FORAGING</h3>   <p>      If you're looking for a homestead or are otherwise      distracted while camping, you won't plan on living      completely off the land . . . but you can still forage      delicacies that will make each meal memorable and unique.    </p>    <p>      The wild plums we found in the Smoky Mountains were a      one-time event, and so we enjoy them even in retrospect as      we remember the place where we picked them and the meal      they spiced up. The cattails we pulled from a canoe in      Wisconsin, the once and never again discovered hazelnuts,      the mulberries that tasted so good off the tree and so flat      in the house . . . all made family history. The more we      forage, the more we feel that the finding and the picking      are a part of the eating. And what a variety nature offers!      There are mushrooms, greens, fish, wild fruits, elder      flowers, wintergreen berries, always <em>something</em> to      gather . . . even if it's only wild onion or garlic. You      needn't worry about running out of onions when you can find      these bulbs everywhere to give character to your soup or      stew or whatever.    </p>    <p>      Foraging has been covered in great detail by more seasoned      practitioners of the art than I am. James Churchill's      well-illustrated series in MOTHER is worth collecting and      binding, if only, it wouldn't break the old girl up to do      so. Refer to Gibbons' and Angier's works (see MOTHER'S      Bookshelf) and to Fernald's definitive <em>Edible Wild      Plants of North America.</em> Substitute one of Uncle      Euell's field guides for a few of those cans in your pack.      Betcha you'll save in the long run, and you'll eat for      real. When you know what to look for in the wild, you don't      worry about whether the next town will have a supermarket.    </p>    <h3>PICKING</h3>   <p>      You needn't limit yourself to California to find good      pickin's in farm fields. Eastern, southern and midwestern      farmers need seasonal help too, especially with such crops      as strawberries, asparagus, peaches, cherries, tomatoes,      apples and peas. Watch the signs, watch the fields, look      for stacked crates, get the small-town papers and take a      chance and ask. You may well find farms where you can:    </p>    <p>      [1] Pick your own produce for a lower-than-retail price.    </p>    <p>      [2] Pick up "drops" for a ridiculous sum. Try visiting an      orchard after a storm . . . the owner is often glad to      salvage some of what would otherwise be a total loss. (Oh,      those peaches we happened on after a hard, windy rain in      the central Pennsylvania mountains! We picked baskets full      of mammoth melting windfalls at give-away prices.)    </p>    <p>      [3] Pick for pay, and-if the food's      unsprayed-earn your own groceries.    </p>        <p>      Once, while away from home-or, more accurately, when      "home" for the summer was a tent in an Elyria, Ohio      campground-we found a blueberry farm where we could      gather our own unsprayed fruit. What's more, the owners      needed workers and were paying something like 10 cents per      pint of berries picked. The deal began to look like free      food and a lot of fun. Harvesting is a job I've always      liked, and I hadn't had a crack at any blueberry bushes for      ages.    </p>    <p>      But the day was hot-a dry July and steady      sun-and our children were only five and seven. "Well,      there it is," we decided. "We'll just make this a learning      experience, that's all." The kids had seen buses full of      migrant workers on the road and were beginning to ask      questions . . . and so we told them: "You'll be hot. You'll      be thirsty. Imagine you're a migrant worker. You'll know      then, a little bit, how it is for them." Now of course we      couldn't provide the whole bit-the crowded shacks,      the pesticide sprays, the lack of dignity, the uncertainty      about wages-but we thought of the experiment as being      a kind of bridge. We took a jug of water and an impromptu      bagged lunch and set off.    </p>    <p>      As matters turned out-despite all our long-faced      sociology-the children loved the work. They picked      and picked and picked. Their tongues got pretty blue, too.      They were needed. They had something to show for their      morning . . . real, heaped baskets of berries. And the      dimes they were paid were not play money. Serves us right      for being so educationally heavy-handed. Maybe it really is      true that learning isn't limited to what the instructor      programs it to be!    </p>    <h3>LOCAL SPECIALTIES</h3>     <p>      Yes, there still <em>are</em> regional differences, and      let's hope there always will be. Not everything is      standardized/devitalized/wrapped up, much as it may seem so      if you only shop at the usual places.    </p>    <p>      Consider sourwood honey. I don't know whether it's produced      <em>anywhere</em> outside the mountains of North Carolina      and Tennessee, where the sourwood tree grows. Sourwood      honey is so much itself, so unique, so spilling over with      flavor . . . that once you've sampled it you crave it again      and remember the taste years later. We bought some while      camping in North Carolina-the whole comb in a quart      jar-and found it so delicious that we made a spoonful      of the honey our dessert after a meal of freshly caught      mountain trout. I mean we had trout and honey for dinner.      (And tea.) Sometimes it's good to eat only a few dishes and      to savor them well. You can do that when they're Real Food.    </p>    <p>      Or take another local specialty, Wisconsin's lefse (thin,      thin Norwegian potato pancakes). They're perfect for nomads      because they keep, taste good cold and wrap up or mop up      all kinds of foods from meats and sauces to cheeses and      spreads. Try this delicacy if you're roamin' in the North      where food markets and bakeries carry lefse (but read the      labels . . . some brands contain preservatives).    </p>    <p>      Pennsylvania Dutch country-despite the violence done      to the landscape and the Amish lifestyle in the tourist      traps-also-a variety of blandishments, not the least      of which is scrapple . . . a loaf made of cornmeal, broth,      liver and pork craps. At a country or small-town butcher      shop or a farmers' market you can buy scrapple that      contains no preservatives. Crisp it up over the campfire      and top it with some eggs. Call it breakfast, lunch or      dinner and eat some violet leaves as you go along your way.      When we were in Wisconsin, we missed scrappie. Now, living      in Pennsylvania, we sometimes yearn for a handful of lefse!    </p>    <p>      Other local specialties are more widely distributed, but      one of die easiest to find is the gristmill where cornmeal      and some times wheat and buckwheat flour are ground with      stones . . . often by water power. Here's where you can get      the fixings for your corn chips and English muffins,      cornmeal mush, buckwheat cakes and such.    </p>    <p>      In many places you can also buy wheat and oats (for      sprouting) directly from farmers. Gives you an excuse to      talk to the folks, too, and to see their places. We always      learn something.    </p>        <p>      Once we stopped to ask a local man whether we might buy      some of the persimmons we had noticed on the ground under      his trees. After we had gathered a basketful and given him      the price he asked, he showed us through his new farrowing      house and let the children pet his young puppies. He had      what we needed, and we were glad to pay him for it. How      good-how much more human-this business of      living becomes when it's possible to buy in this way!    </p>    <p>      Finally, the whole vegetable gardening/truck farming scene      is in a time of transition. Organic growers are putting up      signs and beginning to let the hungry seekers of whole      foods know where they are. To my mind, the most helpful      directory to tracking down these sources is the <em>Guide      To Organic Foods Shopping and Organic Living</em> (Emmaus,      Pennsylvania: Rodale Press, $1.00). We've followed up      several leads from the <em>Guide</em> to buy organic beef,      vegetables, honey and such and plan to lean on it even more      heavily in our coming travels. The sellers are listed by      state and some are worth going out of your way to find.    </p>    <p>      The thing about the mountains is . . . something wonderful      could be around the next bend, and often is. The thing      about the plains is . . . you can really see it all. The      thing about the woods is . . , they're so secret, they have      their own life.    </p>    <p>      Wherever you are, whether you're on your way or on the road      or on the land, you can eat well without doing violence to      the land, or to your body, or to your economy. A little      food yeast, a little foraging, a little looking around and      you'll be living on real stuff while campin' or movin' on.    </p>    <p>      Let us know what you discover. Happy wandering!    </p>
