            		        <h5 id="byline">      by BOB AND CAROL KELLY    </h5>    <div class="sidebar"><p>      At last my wife and I have left the ranks of those who read      and dream about homesteading and have joined "them that's      doin' ". It seems as if we took an extraordinarily long      time in realizing our plans, but actually we needed less      than three years to get ourselves together ... so that by      the fall of 1972 we were able to make the down payment on      our farm in northern Minnesota. If you're considering a      move of your own, you might like the lowdown on our place      and its cost and financing. I remember that when our      homestead was in the planning stage we were always      interested in such information.    </p>    <p>      Our land is 80 acres in area, with the front 40 mostly open      and the back 40 wooded. The arable half is seeded to      alfalfa and timothy. (Hay is the main crop up here since      the season is too short for shell corn or soybeans.)    </p>    <p>      A neighbor who had rented this acreage from the previous      owners assured us that no pesticides or commercial      fertilizers had ever been used on the place. I don't think      this abstinence was really due to an inherent dislike for      plastic farming ... it's just that most of the ground in      the area has been cleared quite recently-only 30 to      40 years back-and has much of its virgin fertility      intact. Also, the climate is not suited to erosion-inducing      and humus-destroying row crops such as corn.    </p>    <p>      The topography is rolling glacial till which has developed      a rich clay-loam topsoil. There's also a fairly large peaty      patch back in the woods. The clay-loam is good for most of      the usual homestead vegetables, as we learned when we saw      the previous owner's large, productive garden last year.      Sweet corn, tomatoes, peppers, bush beans, potatoes, peas,      Brussels sprouts, lettuce, cabbage, raspberries and      rhubarb-mostly early varieties especially selected      for the short northern season-were all thriving in      our rich, dark earth. (One caution: The soils in this area      do vary greatly in fertility, and you should become      familiar with their types and capabilities if you're      planning to look for a farm up here. Much of the land is      very thin, with a gravelly substratum near the surface.)    </p>    <p>      Our woods are fairly typical: mostly second-growth aspen      and elm with a liberal mixture of birch, basswood, red      maple and red oak. We also have a grove of about 30 white      pine, and numerous large balsams are scattered about the      forty. The latter evergreens we'll hoard for various      building projects. If we cut the trees ourselves and haul      them to the sawmill, we can turn them into lumber for only      $14.00 per 1,000 board feet. Eight or ten of the big white      pines would easily frame up and sheathe a small home,      leaving the balance of the grove of graceful giants intact.    </p>    <p>      Wildlife is quite abundant on our place. Snowshoe rabbits      and grouse are the most common small game with a few gray      and red squirrels thrown in for good measure. Across the      road in Teepee Lake are half a dozen or so beaver lodges.      Deer also are fairly numerous ... their trails crisscross      the woods and many beds can be found beneath the      low-hanging balsams. Most of the natives around here fill      their freezers with venison, sometimes out of season and      without a license. I'm not so bold, though. There are stiff      penalties for the poachers that are caught by the      ever-watchful game wardens.    </p>    <p>      The only birds we've seen so far are the winter residents:      Canada jays, blue jays, chickadees, downy woodpeckers,      barred owls and the mysterious, eerily croaking ravens. The      front forty has several low, wet spots ditched to drain      into an even lower area in the woods, and water stands      there most of the year as a nesting place for a small      population of ducks.    </p>    <p>      Also, of course, we enjoy the famed fishing of northern      Minnesota, where the many lakes and rivers offer a wide      variety of high-quality fish to supplement the low-cost      diet of the homesteader. The range and abundance of the      local wildlife-to my mind an indication of high      environmental quality-was an important factor in our      decision to settle here.    </p>    <p>      Our house and outbuildings are located on the front forty      up on a little knoll overlooking a gravel road, just      opposite a small, utterly undeveloped lake. To the north      and west of the buildings there are two or three acres of      woods left to break the prevailing winds from those      directions.    </p>    <p>      The house is fairly small, based on an original two-story      frame structure with one room upstairs and one downstairs.      A later addition gave us two more first-floor rooms and a      little enclosed porch on the back. Surprisingly, there's an      indoor toilet and bath ... conveniences which still aren't      taken entirely for granted in these parts. A rustic      trapdoor in the middle of the kitchen floor leads to a      crude but serviceable root cellar beneath the house. The      place came with a wood-burning cookstove and heater which      took us a month or so to learn to use efficiently.    </p>    <p>      Our outbuildings (also fairly modest, a good size for      small-scale home production projects) include a brooder      house, woodshed, machine shed, granary and log barn. One      odd fact about these structures is that the more easily      visible sides are the only ones which are painted and well      roofed ... a point we didn't notice until after we'd moved      in. (Moral: Take a look at the back of anything you      consider purchasing!)    </p>    <p>      The barn has a cement floor and a small hayloft overhead,      and it's scheduled for conversion into a multi-purpose      animal shelter like the one described in the HAVE-MORE Plan      (see MOTHER NO. 2). Putting all our livestock into one      building will help keep them significantly warmer in our      bitterly cold winters.    </p>    <p>      All of the above cost us $8,500 with a down payment of      $2,500, or just a hair under the 30% which is fairly      standard up here. We have a land contract for the balance      with an interest rate of 7-3/4% and installments of $75.00      per month (no penalty for paying up early). Some agreements      call for rates as low as 6%, while others go all the way to      8%.    </p>    <p>      Those figures may sound higher than rates you've heard      quoted for this area ... but remember, land prices are      going up very rapidly. In fact, the folder in which the      realtor had our place listed priced it at $16,500! When we      said we could go only to $8,000, however, the agent came      down a total of $8,000 to the selling price of $8,500. This      may have happened because we came out after Labor Day when      the tourists had gone home and the area had quieted down      considerably. Or the owner may just have needed the money      in a hurry when we were there on the spot. In any case,      don't be afraid to dicker.    </p>    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/pix2257.jpg" alt="pix2257.jpg" width="400" height="225" />    </div>    <p>      A cheaper way to get land is simply to buy unimproved      timber acreage, usually sold in 40-acre parcels without      buildings. Right now such tracts are running between $3,000      and $4,000 from the local representatives of national real      estate companies that buy large farms for speculation. The      tracts can be had for low down payments but at quite high      rates of interest.    </p>    <p>      Undeveloped property doesn't give you a place to move to      immediately, of course, but at least you've got the land      ... and lack of improvements may suit the many people who      plan ultimately to build some dwelling more compatible with      sound ecology than the standard, white frame farmhouse. At      least you don't have to pay for something you may be      tearing down later.    </p>    <p>      The "back tax" land scene around here is not really as good      as one might be led to believe. With the recent great leap      in this area's property values, people seem more willing to      keep up on their taxes ... especially since the rates are      so low (only $52.47 on our farm this year). Another trouble      with back-tax acreage is that much of it is inaccessible by      road so that-once you get your place-you have      to build a way in. This can be expensive.    </p>    <p>      Another possibility for homesteading is the large amount of      unimproved county land scattered in parcels among the      privately owned farms. In our county (Beltrami) an owner of      adjacent property can buy such acreage rather cheaply ...      usually for $8.00 per acre plus the assessed value of any      timber on the tract. Thus one could buy a forty lying next      to county land and double his holding for $1,000 or less.      (I don't know why such transactions are restricted to      owners of adjoining plots.) If you like this idea, you      should contact the land commissioner of the county you're      interested in for more specific information.    </p>    <p>      I'll close with a few suggestions which might make your      Minnesota property-hunting easier. First, every county has      rather detailed maps that show all roads, trails, streams,      lakes, building sites, fire towers, etc., within its      boundaries. These documents can be obtained at the various      county courthouses, usually for a charge of 25  cents. Plat      maps giving individual property lines and owners' names are      likewise available, at 50  cents a copy, for each township      within a county. Such charts make it much easier to      pinpoint and locate land in which you're interested.    </p>    <p>      If you have plenty of time to hunt for a place, try asking      around on your own out in the country about property that      may be for sale. Stop in at the rural stores, gas stations      and taverns and let the proprietors know that you're      looking for land. Occasionally they'll know of relatives or      friends who are selling farms.    </p>    <p>      Often a deal you turn up on your own will be somewhat less      expensive than if the offer had been listed by the realtors      in town. We've heard of 40-acre spreads going for as low as      $2,000 when sold privately, whereas similar parcels handled      by real estate agents run at least $1,000 to $2,000 more.      Of course, though, to find such buys you've got to get out      and do your own digging. Also, realtors around here are      friendly and helpful and provide expertise in the details      of finalizing a sale, so there are advantages to both      methods of locating property.    </p>    <p>      Finally, we'd advise you to make your decision to buy as      soon as possible. As we've said, the price of land is      spiraling upward. Our own place was bought and sold twice      in the last two years and jumped $1,000 in cost each time.      As we look at the next five years it's not difficult to      foresee the price of small farms and acreages going up out      of reach of homesteaders who would actually live on their      holdings. That development would leave the countryside in      the hands of the comparatively well-off weekend      snowmobilers and the grasping land speculators.    </p>    <p>      That's about all we can pass on about the local land      situation. Good hunting ... and stop in and visit for a      spell if you're in the Bemidji area looking for a      homestead.    </p>    <p>      Bob & Carol Kelly<br />      Pinewood, Minnesota 56664    </p></div>
