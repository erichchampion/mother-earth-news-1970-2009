        <p>Long before our home plantings even begin to flower in June, mouthwatering berries of all kinds arrive (at world class prices) in the fancy-food departments of supermarkets, first from Chile, then from Central America and Mexico, and, finally, from warmer areas of North America - raspberries from California and blueberries from Georgia. As with most mass-produced produce, these berries capably fill the stomachs of those who have but a fleeting memory of a backyard raspberry bush, but they are only a moon-cast shadow of what may be the most delicious food in the world.</p><div class="sidebar">A few varieties of wild berries need cooking, but the most common and plentiful can be eaten fresh out of hand. They can be cooked up in pies or tarts, or they can be dried, frozen or canned for preserves or whole fruit. Berries provide a fair complement of vitamins and minerals along with the quick energy of natural sugars. Plus, they are free for the taking and come on without any help from us, some years appearing in astounding quantities.</div><h3>Identify Wild Berries: Where to Forage</h3><p>One or another fruiting plant grows practically everywhere in North America. Indeed, the greatest variety of berries are found on low bushes and ground creepers native to our most hostile climate: snow country of the U.S./Canadian borderlands and up into the Great White North. Till you prospect the country, you'll never know how climate, topography and soil chemistry combine to determine the berry species that will grow there. When you do, make it an expedition of discovery.</p><p>And think like a raspberry. A berry's only role in nature is to peddle seeds that the parent plant wants distributed as far afield as possible. The preferred customers of most berry species are farflying birds. That's why a plant surrounds its fruit with thorns intended to fend off slowpokes such as you, me, wild pigs and bears. It grows best in full sun. If its roots are in the shade, it will extend long, flowering branches, canes or the stolons used by ground-berries as far out into the sun as possible.</p><p>Trees and berry bushes sprout everywhere birds drop seed, but most thrive only in the sun. You'll often find berry bramble canes at road and field edges or at meadow margins. In spring, where brush has grown up all around parent brambleberry plants you'll spot white-flower-garlanded canes arching up and over adjoining plants to seek the sun. There, bees will find the flowers and birds will spy the bright berries when they are ripe.</p><h3>Identify Wild Berries: How to Forage</h3><p>Think like a bluejay. Look from ground level up to eye level and at all low trees. Many common berries grow in both bush and creeper forms. Creeper berries are underfoot, often extended above the greenery on long stems. Fruiting trees are low-growers that attract high-flyers like jays along with low-flying ground birds such as warblers that migrate through the underbrush.</p><p>Search in natural meadows, at river and pond margins, overgrown farm fields or recent burns, along country roads and lanes, and under power line rights-of-way. Some berries grow in marshes, others in sandy barrens. The guides recommend "disturbed ground" or places where man has removed trees and undergrowth, then abandoned the land, providing several decades of sunny ground for fast-growing berry bushes and small fruiting trees to colonize, before forest trees grow up to shade them out.</p><p>Till you are well-experienced, avoid all vine fruit save for wild grapes that grow up into the trees, fruit in clusters like store grapes, have twisty tendrils on their stems and leaves with serrated edges and a heart-shaped base. The fruit are dark blue or red and have a sweet outer skin that slips off easily from the glutinous, sour inner seed envelope. Seeds number one to three and are hard. In the North, they taste like Concord grape jelly or Manishewitz, in the South, like Muscatel wine. Young shoots and leaves are edible.</p><p>Most other wild vine fruit are poisonous or hard to differentiate from look-alikes that are. The fruit of <em>Smilax</em> genus, misnamed carrion flower in the North and greenbrier (bullbrier) in the South, grow on vines that produce small clumps of edible black or blue-black berries. They are never abundant (I can show you but a single vine hereabouts), and can be confused with the fruit of the Virginia creeper, which puts out a spray of small, blue, appetizing looking (and marginally palatable but toxic) berries. Uncommon, but poisonous, Canada moonseed looks like grapes but has large (up to ten-inch) round, smooth edged leaves, bitter fruit and crescent shaped seeds. Poison ivy, when it climbs a tree to fruit, produces unappetizing, hard white berries, while nightshade's berries are small, orange-red and bitter (its other name is "bittersweet"). Both are toxic in one way or another.</p><h3>Identify Wild Berries: When to Forage</h3><p>Summer is best, though some berries fruit in spring and others in fall. Many even hold on till winter, with some, such as Hawthorn's mini-apples, improving in sweetness and flavor after frost. Following is a list of the most common berries of midwestern and eastern North America. But first . . .</p><p><strong><em>Three warnings before your trip out:</em></strong></p><p>1. Make a positive identification before you pick or eat any berry. Obtain, study and use a reliable, up-to-date field guide. (See "Sources" at the end of this article). If possible, make your first trips with a long-time berry-picker from your local area; field experience is by far the best teacher.</p><p>2. You'll want to avoid areas that have been sprayed recently with herbicide. Most spraying is done early in the growing season when plants are making fastest growth and are most vulnerable. Dead vegetation is an indication of a recent spraying. If vegetation in an even ribbon along the roadside or under the highlines looks to be growing, but is stunted, unevenly leafing out or well behind similar plants growing elsewhere, you have an old spray zone that is fighting back. Any fruit will have grown on canes or buds produced after the spray lost strength. But still, I'd leave it and come back next year.</p><p>3. Make a lot of racket in the berry patch. Bears like berries, too, but will instinctively move away if they sense humans approaching. You learned this from birth if you're from grizzly country in Alaska or the Yukon. But contrary to common (mis)knowledge, the common black bear of the lower 48 and Canada can also pose a danger to people. Don't surprise them.</p><h2>Common Wild Berries of Central and Eastern North America</h2><h3>Bramble Fruits, Rubus Species: Blackberries, Raspberries, Dewberries, Wineberries</h3><p><strong><em>Blueberries</em></strong></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Red to purple-black, round to oval, seedy aggregate fruits measuring a half inch to an inch; variably sweet to sour, juicy to dried-out, depending on species, rainfall and age. Hundreds of species; all edible. Longish, dark purple blackberries pull off a stem, rounder raspberries slip off a half-round cap. Bush varieties grow on long, thorny canes that sprout from perennial roots and live only one fruiting season. Dead canes persist for years, creating bramble patches that no berry-fancier but a rabbit could love. Low growing blackberries, called dewberries, fruit on low creepers with short thorns that can't resist snagging your jeans or socks.</p><p><strong><em>Mourning Warbler with Wild Blackberries</em></strong></p><p><strong>Location:</strong> East and Northwest. Dry, open ground, sunny meadows, road and field margins, "disturbed ground." Some varieties enjoy sandy soil. Blackberries grow farther south than raspberries.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Profusion of white to pink, open-petaled flowers bloom in spring, fruit appears summer to fall. Blackberries arrive two weeks later than raspberries.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> None. No aggregate berry (those, like raspberries, that are made up of clusters of juicy little drupelets) is poisonous to man or beast.</p><p><strong><em>Blueberries, Huckleberries</em></strong></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Highbush variety grows on six-to 20-foot, woody-stemmed, evenly rounded bushes. Lowbush variety grows on dense creepers along the ground and up to two-feet high. Displays downhanging, white, bell-shaped flowers in spring; in summer, sprouts sprays of familiar round, blue fruits, not shiny, often dusted with white powder, with five small blue petal-like calyx lobes at the blossom end.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Blueberries need an acid soil. They do well in bogs and barrens with leached-out sand or peat soil. Dried up beaver ponds (flat spots in rolling hill country) are good. Oak trees can indicate good blueberry land.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Flowers in spring, berries in summer.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> The arguably toxic (the books don't agree) pokeweed berry has a roughly similar appearance to blueberries, but grows thinly on a rough shrub with long leaves and red stems. Unappetizing (they just <em>look</em> poisonous), glossy, single-drupe berries are dark red-purple, scalloped around margins and wider than deep. They come larger, same size or smaller than a blueberry, with or without a short stem per berry, and grow lined up close together around the end of a thin branch. Mature root, seeds and rind of the stem are highly toxic.</p><p>Emerging poke shoots are widely eaten like asparagus or forced like Belgian endive, though red ends of the shoots are cut off. The berries are all purple-red, and Foxfire 2 (wisdom of state-of-Georgia elders) warns against them. I don't know any old-timers who'll eat them, though the berries do figure in more than one folk remedy.</p><p>Fruit of buckthorns resemble blueberries, but are blacker and bitter and cluster along branches of a shrub. Some have thorns.</p><p><strong><em>Elderberries</em></strong></p><p>Appearance: Flowers bloom in a six-inch or so diameter spray of dozens of white blossoms (called "elderblow," they are delicious dipped in a light egg batter and fried in butter to make fritters), followed by a multitude of small dark red-purple berries in summer. Wait till berries are ripe and juicy. Toxic to some people when eaten raw, with a strong sweet-bitter flavor, they cook up into a grand juice for jelly, flavor for apple wine, cordials or syrup. Mix juice with an equal part sugar and some lemon juice to counter the bitter, cook till bubbly and pressure-can in pint jars for syrup to go on pancakes or ice cream. Once when I was little, my Great Aunt Elsa served fresh-picked, egg-batter-fried elderblow with elderberry syrup for breakfast to the whole family (we'd gone out to the old farm for strawberry time in June). I was too young to appreciate the weedy appearance of the blossoms or the bitter principle of the syrup, so I settled for fritter-batter pancakes with fresh strawberries; I've been kicking myself ever since.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Elderberries need a rich forest soil and are found in moist woodlands, at margins of fields and along trails and forest roads.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Flowers bloom June to July, fruits appear late Summer into fall.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> See blueberry warning.</p><p><em><strong>Wild Cherries: Black Cherry And (Red) Chokecherry</strong></em></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Small (quarter-inch) round, red or blue-black berries in sprays on low trees. Young trees of dark-fruited black cherry have a shiny, reddish bark with shallow pits. Snapped twigs have the characteristic "wild cherry" odor. Fruits are small, juicy, round cherries born along lengthy stems at ends of branches. Chokecherry fruit grows similarly but is bright red to purple. It is bitter or sour or both, but palatable as a trail refresher and can add a wild flavor to apple jelly or wine. Native Americans dried and used them in pemmican and other winter foods and trail mixes.</p><p>Of the <em>Prunus</em> genus and related to plums, cherry trees have the characteristic fruit tree leaf: ovoid, small, with many blunt teeth around margin. It's easy to confuse chokecherries with small red bushberries, which is OK. As a rule of thumb, if a bright red, juicy berry growing in quantity on a wild bush or tree tastes good (even if it's a little sour), it is edible. If it is too sour, spit it out. But, as with any wild food, be sure to ID it from a book before eating in any quantity.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Wild cherries grow rapidly from bird-dropped seeds, quickly colonizing clearings, and are common weed trees of "disturbed land" throughout the East and upper Midwest.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Cherry blossoms bloom in spring; fruit grows in summer and often holds on the tree till fall.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> Wilted leaves and egg-shaped seeds of both red and black cherries contain poisonous hydrocyanic acid. Don't swallow the seeds! Only toxic look-alike is uncommon and inedibly bitter.</p><p><strong>Similar Fruit:</strong> Highbush cranberry (not a cranberry at all), nannyberry, squawberry and other fruit of northern woods and marshes look like wild cherries (and sometimes are called so locally). Use a field guide to differentiate. Also taste test: If bitter, don't eat them.</p><p><em><strong>Cranberries</strong></em></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> One of only three fruits native to North America (the blueberry and Concord grape being the other two), this round, red fruit with many small, soft seeds looks the same in the wild as in your grocery store. So prized was the cranberry by our forefathers that in 1677, the colonists sent ten barrels of the fruit to England to placate King Charles II, after they'd had the nerve to mint their own shillings. Tart, hard and virtually inedible until cooked, cranberries grow on low trailing shrubs or creepers.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Acid soils and bogs of upper Northeast; mountain cranberry found in similar areas all across far North.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Ripens in fall, often stays on plant over winter.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> None.</p><p><strong><em>Serviceberries (Juneberries)</em></strong></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> The red or downy serviceberry of the East and the blue or Saskatoon serviceberry of the Northwest are both dark red to purple, three-tenths of-an-inch-sized fruits with small blossomed calyx lobes that look like oversized blueberries. Serviceberries have noticeable seeds and grow in clusters at ends of twigs. Some species are sweet and juicy; others taste better cooked. Native Americans dried them for pemmican.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Serviceberries grow on small to 20-foot trees that like well-watered ground, often beside streams.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Showy white to pink flowers appear in spring; fruit ripen mid-to late-summer.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> None.</p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> The wild strawberry is a tiny version of the domesticated varieties (it is of the same species, Fragraia), though it can be sweeter and more fragrant than garden varieties if sun and rain have been good. Leaves have three leaflets with serrated edges and are dull, not shiny like three-leaved poison ivy. The fruit is often raised up to the sun on longish stems.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Fields and meadows everywhere that birds drop seed. Uncommon wood strawberry likes shade and is larger than common variety and not as tasty.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Small flowers with yellow centers and five white petals appear in early spring; fruit ripens from green to white to pink to red in June.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> None. Wild strawberries have no nasty look-alikes and are never toxic.</p><p><strong><em>Low Berries Of the Northern Woodlands</em></strong></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> These red, blue, yellow or white, nutritious but mostly blah flavored berries grow low to the ground in the woods of the North country. Bunchberries are a red stone fruit, borne in a cluster atop a whorl of six leaves. Easy to pick, but hard to separate tasteless pulp from seed. Cloudberry, found from the Arctic to New England, grows much the same as red bunchberry but with yellow fruit. Wintergreen or checkerberry of eastern and midwestern north woods ripens in fall and improves with freezing. A relative, creeping snowberry, is white, oval and grows on stems covered with tiny evergreen leaves. Bearberries of the Rockies and North are red and mealy, with colorful leaves used as a ceremonial tobacco by Native Peoples.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> All across the U.S. Canadian border, throughout inland Maine and north.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Most ripen in fall; many persist into winter.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> Many species; a field guide is essential to identify absolutely. But no toxic look-alikes.</p><p><strong><em>Evergreens, Junipers and Yew</em></strong></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Red or blue berries growing along branches of evergreen (needled) trees or shrubs. American yew produces attractive, three-eighths-inch, urn-shaped red fruit with a sweet pulp and poison seeds. Western junipers produce dusty blue fruit that look like blueberries.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Yew is a common foundation plant that can be spread anywhere. Junipers grow in California and in portions of the mountain West.</p><p><strong>Season:</strong> Summer to early winter.</p><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> Though the fruit looks tempting, yew is best avoided except as an emergency food. <em>Never</em> swallow a seed. Juniper berries are never toxic, but some species contain so much resin they are unpalatable. Utah, California and Rocky Mountain junipers are the good ones. A regional field guide will confirm edibility.</p><p><strong><em>Other Wild Berries</em></strong></p><p>Barberry, the common foundation plant is spread by birds and grows wild in many places. Its familiar, downdrooping, hard red fruit is sour but edible when cooked with sugar. Hawthorn trees produce a mini-apple that is sweetened by frost. Wild (seedling) apples escaped from orchards and wild native plums grow everywhere in the woods. On ocean dunes you'll find sea plums, sea grapes, rose hips and other edible berries. Take a field guide wherever you go. And in areas of unusual plant life-deserts, mountains, ocean rims-pick up a local guide so you can feast safely on nature's bounty of berries. They're free for the picking practically anywhere you wander.</p><h3>Sources</h3><p>Two of the best field guides carry the same name.</p><p><em><strong>Edible Wild Plants, A North American Field Guide</strong></em> (Sterling, 1992) by Eilas and Dykeman.

Turner. Iron Eyes Cody said of this book, "Every Boy Scout should have a copy."

For the past half-billion years, these tiny, underground relatives of mushrooms have evolved in concert with sun-loving green plants.<br /></p><p class="sidebar">Like all fungi, mycorrhizae contain no chlorophyll, so lack green plants' ability to synthesize sugar from water and sunlight. They obtain nourishment by tapping into host plants' roots. In return, they exert a beneficial mechanical and chemical influence on the surrounding soil by extending root fibers and converting raw soil components into forms more readily absorbed and metabolized by their host plants. In addition, the fungi facilitate water intake and transpiration while moderating intake of salt and other chemical soil pollutants. Plants growing in soil inoculated with the appropriate species of mycorrhizae will survive transplantation more easily and will grow and produce better, faster and more uniformly.</p><p class="sidebar">A four-year-old California firm, EcoLife Corporation, is growing a variety of mycorrhizae in an all-natural process discovered by founder Mike Brock. Ecolife calls their product Bio-Vam. In addition to the mycorrhizae, Bio-Vam contains nitrogen-fixing bacteria, nematode trapping fungi, humic and folic acid, minerals and other ingredients to give seeds or transplants the best start. Each transplant is inoculated with about one teaspoon of Bio-Vam in the field, is roots soaked in kelp and is planted between the rows of old plants, which will eventually lose vitality and be replaced by the new stock. Annual safflower, rape, mustard and daikon radish are planted as cover crops to put roots down into the soil, break up compaction, capture nitrogen and give some nematode protection.</p><p class="sidebar">Ecolife can custom-mix Bio-Vam for most any application, but so far deals in bulk quantities for nurseries or farms. Home gardeners can obtain small lots from their Northeastern distributor: T&J Enterprises of Spokane, Washington. Order by phone (See Sources) or through the secure server on their Internet site: www.tandjenterprises.com. A trial package of wide-spectrum Bio-Vam is available for only $4 prepaid. A quart goes for less than $25 plus shipping. Considering that each quart contains 192 teaspoons and you only need 1/2 to 1 teaspoon per transplant, you can guarantee super production from this fall's raspberry plantings and have enough Bio-Vam left over for next season's vegetable garden.</p><p class="sidebar"></p><h3 class="sidebar">Sources:</h3><p class="sidebar"></p><p class="sidebar">EcoLife, Moorpark, CA. T&J Enterprises, Spokane, WA; www.tandjenterprises.com.</p><p class="sidebar"><strong><em>TISSUE CULTURE CLONING FOR DISEASE-FREE PLANTS</em></strong></p><p class="sidebar">Many berries propagate vegetatively, that is, baby plants sprout from above-ground runners, underground stolons or live cuttings from a parent plant rather than from seeds. With such direct and prolonged plant-to-plant contact, parents can't help but transmit viral diseases to offspring. And, since there is no effective treatment for viral rusts and blights, it was long thought that breeding in resistance, soil fumigation and periodic renewal of virus-plagued plantings with fresh stock were a routine part of berry culture.</p><p class="sidebar">But some years ago, strawberry researchers discovered they could clone disease-free plants by propagating young plants from embryonic "meristem" cells removed from the minuscule tip ends of growing shoots. This undifferentiated plant tissue grows so rapidly that viral infection in the parent has no chance to reach it.</p><p class="sidebar">Disease-free meristem cells are removed under a microscope, propagated into tiny plants in test tubes, transferred to laboratory growing cells, then finally planted in sterile ground. Resulting "tissue-cultured" (TC) plants are disease free, healthier and more productive than plants propagated in the usual way. Plantings will remain virus free and productive for years till pathogens arrive from outside.</p><p class="sidebar">Meristem culture has recently been adapted to grow popular caneberries as well as strawberries. You can purchase young (four-inch-tall) TC raspberry and blackberry plants right out of the lab, or larger first-generation plants grown in sterilized soil in the nursery.</p><p class="sidebar">Before planting any disease-free berry plants, we recommend that you remove and burn any old berry plants along with their mulch, and plant the former berry patch to a green manure, then to assorted garden vegetables. Dig a new berry patch in fresh ground (ideally, soil that has been planted to grains or vegetables for a year or two).</p><p class="sidebar">Most important, to keep viral infestation away, pull (roots and all) and burn all live, wild cane berries growing within 1,000 feet or less of the new plants. Burning dead canes, leaves and natural mulch beneath the wild plants is also a good idea. Do this the season before planting new stock to avoid smoke-borne contamination of new plants by nearly indestructible virus spores.

In the Northeast, everything from the masts of sailing ships to matchsticks was made from tall, straight, sweet-cutting white (five-needled) pine. With the imagined threat of a blister rust plague looming over the timber industry, most Northcentral and Northeastern states passed laws against importing domesticated ribes onto their soil.</p><p class="sidebar">By the 1960s, it was known that the white pine blister rust uses only wild native ribes species as an intermediate host, not the domesticated varieties. But hardly anyone noticed; what with once-wooden gadgets all being molded from plastic, and building lumber taken over by southern white pine and California Douglas fir, the white pine is no longer an essential building commodity. Due in part to the Eastern states' century-long importation ban, ribes never assumed the same popularity in America as in Europe.</p><p class="sidebar">Many of the ancient anti-ribes laws remain on the books, though not all are enforced. But the popular belief persists that gooseberries and currants carry the white pine blister rust. Some nurserymen will not ship ribes berry plants into historically prohibited areas, and others leave it up to the buyer. At present (fall 1999) ribes may not be shipped into Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Rhode Island. States with some restrictions include: Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia. The rule of thumb is: "Do not plant ribes within 1,000 feet of a stand of five-needled pine."</p><p class="sidebar">Our advice is that you abide by the rule. Originally, a "stand" of pine meant a forest containing enough trees to be logged off profitably. These litigious days, if your neighbor's lone front-yard white pine falls ill from whatever malady, your gooseberries are liable to be held responsible. And they may be. Plant developers use wild berry stocks in crossbreeding to incorporate their native vigor and hardiness, color or taste into new varieties. Unknown to anyone, the latest hot new variety of currant or gooseberry may well harbor a native parent plants susceptibility to white pine blister rust.</p><p>Wild berries are abundant in our wild lands and largely ignored by today's suburbanized population. In times of genuine scarcity, rather than a supermarket luxury, berries would become a staple food for those of us who know where the wild ones grow, and when and how to harvest them.</p>
