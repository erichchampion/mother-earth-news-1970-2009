        <p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p><p>Greetings! I've a couple of tips. First, with plenty of ventilation in the room, you can use a foaming oven cleaner to dislodge built-up wax on a vinyl or tile floor. Keep applying, letting it set and then scraping. In our case, it was the only product that did the trick. No more floor waxing for me!</p><p>Second, you can make milk paint to seal and color raw wood. Whip one-and-a-half cups of nonfat milk powder with half a cup of water. If too thin, add a bit more powdered milk; if too thick, add a bit more water. Whip it very well, until it's about the consistency of latex paint. Add a small amount of water-based color (acrylics made for craft painting) and stir thoroughly. I found myself with tiny globs of undissolved milk powder, but running the mix through a piece of cheesecloth solved the problem. Paint your wood with one coat and let dry for 24 hours before putting on a second coat, which will need to dry and set up for three days.</p><p><em>Janet Hounsell</em>Â <em><br />Conway, New Hampshire</em></p>
