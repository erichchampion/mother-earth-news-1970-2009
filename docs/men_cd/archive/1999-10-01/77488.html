    <p>
            	<p><strong>SEASONS OFEARTH AND SKY</strong>	</p>	            <p>      The growing season is at an end for the year, for The      decade of the 1990s and for the century, if you can believe      it. But a late-fall walking tour of the snoozing garden is      in order to prepare for the first harvest of the new      millennium .<br />      <br />      Before a final tilling it's good to go over the land      carrying a stout shovel. A nursery spade with a narrow,      foot-long transplanting blade is best if you have one. If      you've let much of the soil grow up in weeds (and don't we      all once the growing season becomes too short to mature      even a fall crop of leaf lettuce?), you may have admitted      burdock (the source of those infernal prickleburrs that      dogs like to "harvest" with their coats) or other      tap-rooted biennials or perennials that will outgrow any      new-seeded crop next year. Look for circular (basal)      rosettes of leaves lying flat to the ground. They are one      to six or eight inches across and are different shades of      dusty gray-green in color. They are alive, if dormant, and      sleepy looking, even by plant standards.    </p>    <p>      <br />      Sink your spade straight down, deep and close beside each      rosette and dig it out with as much root as you can get.      Rototill the crowns under; they won't sprout from chopped      stem and rosette, and the remaining deep root will rot away      to nourish your future crops. If you can identify the plant      absolutely as burdock from its rhubarb-like leaves, try      cooking the peeled root for 30 minutes or so. It eats like      parsnip.<br />      <br />      This is also the best time to kill the season's worth of      weed seed the wind has blown into your garden soil. A fall      tilling will bury many but not all, and buried weed seed      can be disinterred with spring cultivation. Before bringing      out the rototiller for the last time, go over bare ground      and weed trash with a propane flame-weeding torch if you      have one. if you don't, they go for $20 and up in the      Harbor Freight and other discount tool merchants' catalogs.    </p>    <p>      Burning old plant growth will reduce it to ash, which will      help sweeten the soil for next season. But before you light      up, be sure the surrounding vegetation is wet from a fall      rain or early snow so that you don't cause a wildfire.    </p>    <p>      To protect any carrots or spinach you are over wintering in      the sod from the desiccating winds the coming months are      sure to bring, put on a weed-seed-free winter mulch of salt      hay, wood chips, pine needles or long lasting oak leaves.      To keep leaves or other loose mulch from blowing away,      cover the pile with green brush cut from the edges of a      nearby wood. Choose leggy branches and next April you can      'plant" them beside your earliest green peas to support the      vines. To give over wintering crops a gentle warming boost      in spring, you can interlayer between the natural mulch and      the green brush cover with sheets of black plastic mulch,      which you'll have to retrieve in spring, or else with      landscape paper, which can later be torn (to let plants      emerge), composted, burned or tilled under. Lacking brush,      the sheeting must be held down with rocks along the edges      and saplings or tomato stakes laid across, to keep it from      flapping and tearing away in the winter winds.    </p>    		<h3>A Head Start on Spring</h3>    <p>      We've increased our experimental fall plantings to try to      get a head start on spring crops. It's no      guarantee-some years work well, others not so well,      largely depending on what kind of weather spring brings.      But it's generally worth a try.    </p>    <p>      Nearly all seeds are dry and hard enough to survive winter      temperatures; indeed, some require a period of winter cold      to sprout at all in spring. It is the prolonged chill and      wetness of early spring soil that dooms the seed of many      plants that evolved in climates that are warm year-round.      Soaked and chilled for weeks before the soil warms up      enough for them to germinate, they soften before sprouting      to produce a living plant's protective chemical and      mechanical processes, and so make easy prey for bugs and      soilborne fungus.    </p>    <p>      The secret to late fall planting for the next season is      threefold. First, select frost-hardy varieties that      originated in cold climates and do well when planted early      in the year. Second, plant them in fall for the earliest      possible start. And third, put them in raised rows with a      well-draining sand layer on top, so rains will filter      through. This way, they won't become waterlogged before      they sprout.    </p>    <p>      As early in the fall as you can, plant open garden soil to      green manures to be tilled under, or to winter wheat, oats      or rye. These early grain crops will be up and growing      before the first snow and will see new root growth during      all but the depth of winter. You can harvest a      life-sustaining crop of grain in early summer (see "Growing      Grains" in MOTHER'S June/July issue for more on raising the      staff of life from scratch).    </p>    <p>      To grow herbaceous vegetables, I like to hoe up raised rows      six inches high and the same across. I top each row with as      much mature compost as I can spare. Then I pile      well-draining sharp sand as high as it will go, perhaps      three inches on each row. I plant most seeds, a half-inch      deep in the top of the sand and tamp it flat. For the      quickest soil-warming, I lay black landscape paper over the      rows with slits along the top ridge to let the germinating      plants work through. From fall to spring, rains and      snowmelt will drain through the waterpermeable landscape      paper, sand and raised soil, preventing (we hope) the seed      from rotting. And even under snow the black paper will      absorb sunlight, warming the soil beneath it. As soon as      the soil temperatures are agreeable, the preplanted seed      will sprout, often peeking out through a late snowfall.      That's how snow peas got their name. When the crop is in,      the sand, compost and black-paper toppings are tilled into      the garden to improve tilth and drainage.    </p>    <p>      The following is a list of the crops and varieties that      we've had success with in recent years. You'll find them      listed in various mail-order catalogs (see "Sources" ). For      hearty, oldtime, open pollinated seeds, try South      Carolina's RH Shumway (RHS) and the New Mexico based Seeds      of Change (SOC). For cold country varieties, contact      Johnny's Selected Seeds (JSS) of Maine and maritime      Canada's Vesey's Seeds for Shorter Seasons (VSSS).    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNOW PEAS</strong> come in two main types:      wrinkle-seeded, which are grown mainly for their large,      well-flavored seeds, and smooth-seeded, which are grown for      smaller seeds and are eaten pod and all. The smooth-seeded      are the easiest to overwinter. I've had the best luck with      the Dwarf Grey Sugar variety. These are not the Oregon and      Sugar Snap varieties that are large, succulent,      wrinkled-skinned and selectively bred and copyrighted so we      can't legally replant saved seed. Dwarf Grey Sugar is the      original little flat snow pea. Pods are best picked when      still tiny, before the seeds begin to develop. Even then,      they often must be stringed to be at their best. For a      seed-producing pea, try Extra Early Alaska. This is also a      smooth-seeded, cold-hardy variety. it grows to 30 inches or      more. Like the Dwarf Grey Sugar, it does best when planted      close together, in parallel rows spaced two inches apart      and supported on brush. Both are old-time varieties from      RHS.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CORN SALAD</strong> , called mache in Europe, is as      close to a guaranteed winter garden success as there is. A      type of valerian that produces minute lettuce-like heads,      it has a flowery, minty flavor and is good in salads-raw,      steamed or stir-fried. Super hardy, you can pick it frozen      solid and it is still good raw or cooked. Sow the tiny      seeds one inch apart in all directions over the top of a      raised row and stir down into the sand. Thin seedlings to      two inches apart. JSS sells a named variety, Vit, that is      recommended for overwintering.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LETTUCE</strong> is also a fairly consistent      producer. I have not tried any variety recently, but a      dependable old standby is Black Seeded Simpson loose-leaf      lettuce. Pick the outer leaves and the plants will produce      till summer heat causes them to bolt to seed, which you can      harvest and plant next year. Most catalogs sell Black      Seeded Simpson. Or save a dollar and get seed from any      grocery store seed rack.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RADISHES</strong> usually do well. Pick a winter      radish such as the white daikon. Good ones are Spring Song      from JSS and Rebel, a new and vigorous, but still      openpollinated (non-hybrid) round red variety from VSSS.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PARSLEY</strong> is slow and thus best started in      summer and heavily mulched over winter. Choose your      variety.    </p>        <p>      <strong>CARROTS</strong> . For really early roots, try      Thumbelina, a one-inch round carrot that is super fast      growing, sweet as any, mini-topped and bite-size. You      needn't peel them when about one inch across. Mix tiny seed      eith sand, sprinkle on top of a raised row and pat in. Thin      to one-and-a-half-inches apart all around for      golfball-sized roots. Available from JSS, SOC, RHS, VSSS.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPINACH</strong> is the quickest-growing source of      vitamins C and A and iron. Long-Standing or Winter      Bloomsdale are among the oldest and most reliable varieties      and are available from SOC and RHS. A good F2 hybrid to try      is the new disease-resistant, wrinkled Tyee, sold by JSS,      RHS and VSSS. Plant the large seeds an inch apart and push      them well down into a sand layer atop a raised row. Thin to      12 inches apart. Harvest outer leaves till they bolt, and      save the seed only if it's a nonhybrid Bloomsdale.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SCALLIONS</strong> will add an oniony savor to any      dish. Punch down seeds of any variant of Evergreen Bunching      (white or red) scallions-the kind that form slender stems      in bunches rather than bulbs They are fast-growing,      cold-proof, guaranteed and available from RHS. JSS praises      the winter-hardiness of their Evergreen Hardy White.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KALE</strong> is a rich source of vitamins A, B and      C and contains a great deal of iron. This loose-leaf      cooking green is the most coldhardy member of the cabbage      family. Winterbore from JSS is a favorite variety, but      perhaps the<br />      best for winter growing is the True Siberian from SOC.      Plant to raised garden rows in single seed rows, seeds one      inch apart. Thin to 18 inches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOURCES</strong> :    </p>    <p>      <strong>Flame Weeders:</strong> Harbor Freight Tools; (800)      423-256; fax: (800) 905-5220; <em>www.harborfreight.com      .</em><br />      <strong>Seed:</strong> Johnny's Selected Seeds, Foss Hill      Road, Albion, ME, 04901; (207) 4374301;      <em>www.johnnyseeds.com .</em><br />      R.H.
