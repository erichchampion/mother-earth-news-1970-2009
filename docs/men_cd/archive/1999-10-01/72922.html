                <p>      Nature's deer repellent, rhubarb in a basket and the      perfect milk paint.    </p>        <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Joyce Tomanek    </h5>            <p>      <strong>H</strong>ere in the Southeast, we've never seen so      many deer. Reports on television and in newspapers from      many parts of the country report a widespread problem with      deer invading even city yards and eating expensive      plantings. I've found a simple, chemical free and      inexpensive way to keep them from devouring my gardens and      shrubbery.    </p>    <p>      Through the years, I've observed the feeding habits of cows      and horses in our pastures and learned some basics. Cows      will not graze where other cows have deposited their      droppings. Horses, on the other hand, will eat where there      is cow dung, but they won't eat grass in an area      contaminated by horse manure. Interestingly, deer join      horses in the pastures and seem to have the same eating      habits, but I can never get close enough to them to see      where they feed and where they don't.    </p>    <p>      So it happened that six years ago, when a new crop of      asparagus emerged in my garden, the deer devoured it as      quickly as it came up. I didn't know what to do. I put up      an electric fence and it helped some, but the wiser      critters soon jumped it and helped themselves. So one day,      I sprinkled horse manure on part of the asparagus bed and      left the other part of the bed alone. The next morning      there was plenty of asparagus still sprouting from the      manure covered area, but every shoot was eaten where there      was no manure. Was it a coincidence, or did the deer just      prefer the asparagus without manure? To find out, I covered      the rest of the asparagus bed with horse manure and had no      further problem with deer eating it that entire spring.      Apparently deer, like horses, will not feed where there's      horse manure. Since this discovery, I've routinely applied      horse manure to my asparagus each spring and there hasn't      been a deer problem yet.    </p>        <p>      In other parts of the garden, I stuck with chicken manure      and cow manure for a while, and the deer kept coming. Last      year, however, I decided to switch to horse manure as my      universal fertilizer. It protected favorite deer foods like      corn seedlings and early spring peas and it kept marauding      nibblers from blueberry bushes. It protected everything.    </p>    <p>      To prove the point, I set out several new young azalea      bushes early last spring. The only horse manure I had on      hand was too fresh to put on the young, tender shrubs, and      by the next morning, they were eaten almost to the ground.      Later in the year, I moved some azaleas I'd rooted from      cuttings. I put on a layer of ground leaves for mulch, then      a light layer of aged horse manure and the azaleas have      done very well. I've seen deer sniff and nuzzle them, but      they have not taken a single nibble.    </p>    <p>      In our area, as in many areas, riding stables are happy to      give folks manure free of charge, so long as they load and      haul it away themselves. Some stables will deliver it for a      reasonable price. Several friends have horses and I can      obtain extra from them when our horse can't provide enough.    </p>    <p>      For those who don't have local access to riding stables or      neighbors with horses, the next time you go for a ride in      the country, take along some covered garbage cans (with      liners if you prefer and keep on the lookout for horses.      I've found that many folks who stable their horses in the      winter are delighted to have someone volunteer to haul away      the manure in the spring.    </p>    <p>      My husband makes fun of me when I go out with my garden      tractor, trailer in tow, and using a flat shovel as a king      sized pooper-scooper gather manure in die pasture. I tell      him I'm going on a treasure hunt... for brown gold.    </p>    <p>      <em>Joyce Tomanek<br /></em> <em>Clarkesville, Georgia</em>    </p>
