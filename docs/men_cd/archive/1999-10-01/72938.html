                            <p>      MOTHER caught up with U.S. Forest Chief Mike Dombeck to      talk about national parks, alternative building and the      future of our land.    </p>        <p>      <em><strong>MEN:</strong></em> <em><strong>Do you think      there should be recreational limits in national forests and      parks?</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      MD: All of our activities need to be within the boundary of      long-term sustainability. We must work within the limits of      the land if we want to realize the benefits generation      after generation.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Do you think there should be a shift toward a      more universally simple lifestyle?</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Well, a simple lifestyle has always been one of my dreams.      I do think that we should be as sufficient as we possibly      can. And just as we need to support a land ethic, we need      to help people understand why our land ethic is an      important aspect of living by the land.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>What are your thoughts on alternative home      building?</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      I think we ought to continue to research technology to see      different ways of building and to look at the progress      we've made so far; a lot of times we don't give ourselves      credit for the progress we have been making. The fact is      we're getting two-and-a-half times the use out of the same      volume of wood today as we did at the turn of the century.      This is [a result of] everything from our efficiency in      milling operations to the utilization of a smaller diameter      of wood. Oftentimes, use of substitute material for      wood-whether it's steel, aluminum or      plastic-consumes far more energy in the production      process and has a more adverse impact on the environment      than wood.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Would you like to continue the marked decrease      of the government's clear-cutting as a way to harvest      trees?</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      The fact is, we're doing about 70% less clear-cutting today      than we did in the late 1980s We need to, I think, realize      that nature has always been a mosaic of ecological states.      Where I'm getting to is I think we need to look at our      landscape and decide what it is that we want; what is it,      and how do we get there. Apply the science and a whole      variety of approaches-maybe thinning, maybe      prescribed fire, maybe harvest salvage or more likely a      combination of these-and continually evaluate our      goals. I think there is a place for clear-cutting on a much      smaller scale.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>What's your favorite wildlife/forest      area?</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Obviously, I'm biased. I think I'm the only chief who grew      up in i national forest. But the thing is, I love the woods      and I have yet to travel to a national forest that that's      out I didn't just absolutely fall in love with. The more I      get to see the beauty that's out there, the more      appreciation I have for the diversity that's out there.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>What's your favorite place to      fish?</em></strong> <em><br /></em>    </p>    <p>      I'm not fussy when it comes to where I can fish. Do you      know that 75% of the recreation that occurs in the outdoors      occurs within a half-mile of water? As we deal with the      increasing recreation values,one of the things I always      like to ask myself is: of value will we be? And by "we" I      mean [the national forest. What will be the importance of      the national forests to the American public in the coining      years.?    </p>
