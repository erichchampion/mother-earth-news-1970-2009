                             <p>      Look up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a...      car? Believe it or not, the fantasy animation of The      <em>Jetson's TV</em> show is about to become a reality with      the introduction of the first-ever car that flies: the      Moller Skycar.     </p>    <p>      The four-seat, red winged car was designed by chief      engineer Paul Moller at his Davis, California-based      company, Moller International. It is propelled by eight      rotopowered engines that allow it to take off, land and      hover like the "power lift" on a military Harrier jet.      "It's truly ingenious," says Moller. "I'm absolutely      certain that if these engines had been invented in the year      1900, we would have never seen the piston engine."    </p>    <p>      The rotary engine was invented by Felix Wankel some 50      years ago and instead of piston valves, rocker arms and      camshafts, this engine uses one efficient triangular part      that rotates inside a peanut-shaped combustible chamber.      Moller and crew have tinkered and improved the machine so      that it can generate 1,000 horsepower, run on kerosene,      gasoline or diesel and can reach speeds of up to 350 miles      per hour at altitudes of up to 30,000 feet. And because it      is lightweight, fuel-efficient and produces surprisingly      low emissions the skycar is environmentally sound.    </p>    <p>      "The resulting emissions will be much lower than those of      an automobile engine, because [th e Skycar] never idles,"      explains Moller. "You're either taking off or flying or      you're not running the engine. Plus, we've already run it      on natural gas and propane, and I'm sure we could make it      run on recycled french fry oil from McDonald's."    </p>    <p>      Vegetable oils aside, the Moller Skycar is poised for its      first test flight by the end of the year, while awaiting      certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.      If all goes well and Moller can interest Chrysler or Boeing      in the reality of the product, the Skycar could take off in      the next five to ten years.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, you may not even have to know how to fly to use      one. Moller's vision includes a preprogrammed computer      network of Skycar routes that will allow anyone to cruise      down to their local vertiport, buckle up, press a button      and go.    </p>    <p>      "It's difficult to envision that," says Moller. "But a lot      of people thought the automobile was a novelty in 1900 and      by 1915 everybody owned one. That's 15 years of technology      that was moving a lot slower than it is today. I think      you're going to see a very rapid [interest] once we      demonstrate the Skycar." Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for      liftoff.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Sam Martin</em>    </p>
