    <p>
                          <p>      Somewhere between my grandmother's wedding silverware and      an odd assortment of vintage tablecloths lies my collection      of family heirloom recipes. Oil-streaked ink on yellowed      pages gives me a glimpse of how, decades ago, my relatives      provided more than food for their families; they created      fond childhood memories. My grandmother's Christmas      chocolate roll was my favorite. We would relish our      delicious chocolate slices after Christmas dinner, knowing      there wouldn't be second helpings. (I suspect that my      grandma looked forward to those few remaining slices the      next day as her small reward for preparing such a feast.)      My husband, on the other hand, fondly remembers his      grandma's recipe for chicken 'n dumplings, a Sunday      tradition that began during World War II.    </p>    <p>      Just recently, my mother and I sorted through a box of      family cookbooks and recipes dating hack to before the turn      of the century. As I read my great-grandmother's favorite      recipes and began comparing past and present methods of      food preparation, it struck me that nowadays we sure have      it easy. Back then, cookbook recipes contained few      directions and great grandma had to rely on cooking tips      from relatives. Much of the food was smoked, pickled and      canned because it was difficult to keep it fresh in an      icebox (thank goodness for Ziploc bags!). There was no such      thing as an oven temperature until the first kerosene stove      outdated the wood burner during the 1920s. Baking a pumpkin      pie? You'd have to cook the pumpkin, since there weren't      any canned goods. And men were seldom caught in the      kitchen, unless to eat.    </p>    <p>      Well, we've come a long way, baby. Like old silver,      heirloom recipes are a part of our heritage. Our ancestors      prepared them with love to nourish their families, leaving      us with memories that we'll pass on to our children. But in      order to enjoy them today, a few alterations are necessary      for the sake of healthy living.    </p>    <h3>      Chocolate Roll (serves 6)    </h3>    <p>      I tried-and failed-to bake a chocolate roll from my      grandma's 1930's settlement cookbook. Maybe it was the      vague directions, or perhaps it wasn't her recipe after      all. My next tack was to combine three recipes, one of      which was from a 1972 Good Housekeeping magazine that I      found at a garage sale.    </p>	<p>			<strong><em>Mocha Filling </em></strong> <em><br />    1 pint whipping cream<br />    2 to 3 tablespoons sugar<br />    1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br />    2 tablespoons sifted cocoa powder<br />    1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder<br /></em><br />	</p>	    <p>      Using an electric mixer, whip the cream on medium-high      speed until it starts to thicken. Add the rest of the      in-<br />      ingredients and beat slowly until it forms peaks. Taste and      see if it needs more sugar. Immediately .. spread onto the      cake (see below)    </p>        <p>      <strong><em>Chocolate Sauce</em></strong> <em><br />      4-ounce bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate bar such as      Ghiradelli<br />      3 to 4 tablespoons vanilla soy milk (not the 1 % fat)</em>    </p>    <p>      In a saucepan, melt the chocolate over very low heat until      just melted, being careful not to let it bum. Whisk in the      soy milk until thick, adding more if needed. Drizzle hot      over slices of chocolate roll.</p><p>    <em><strong>Cake</strong><br />    5 large eggs, separated V cup sugar<br />    £ cup cocoa powder<br />    cup sifted unbleached white flour<br />    teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extra cocoa    powder<br /></em>		</p>    <p>      Let the eggs sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes.      Oil a 10" x 15" baking sheet or jelly roll pan and line it      with waxed paper cut to fit. (Lay the waxed paper inside      the pan and trace around it with a pen.) Preheat the oven      to 350°F. Separate the eggs, putting the yolks and      whites into separate mixing bowls. Add the sugar and      vanilla to the bowl with the yolks. Sift together onto a      paper plate the measured cocoa, flour and baking powder.      Once the oven is preheated, beat the egg whites with an      electric mixer on high speed until the mixture stiffens and      peaks start to form. Set aside and immediately beat the      yolk mixture on medium speed for about two minutes, until      it looks like whipped butter. Slowly beat in the cocoa,      flour and baking powder until just blended. Scrape the      beaters and fold the egg whites carefully into the cocoa      mixture using a rubber spatula or a whisk. (The whisk is      easier but be careful not to over mix and deflate the egg      whites.) Spoon onto the baking sheet and spread evenly.      Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until an inserted toothpick      comes out clean; don't over bake or the cake will dry out.    </p>    <p>      While the cake is baking, lay an old dish towel on the      kitchen counter (not terry cloth). Sift cocoa powder      onto<br />      the towel in the shape of the baking pan. Remove the cake      from the oven and immediately invert onto the towel. Peel      off the waxed paper, and starting at a short end, gently      roll up the cake jelly-roll style into the towel. Lay on a      wire rack steam-side-down for at least 30 minutes to cool.      Prepare the mocha filling. Unroll the cake and leave it on      the cocoa-covered towel. Spread on the filling, leaving      about an inch free of filling on one of the short ends.      Stan rolling without the towel on the opposite end until      you have a tight roll. (Make sure your hands are dry so you      don't smudge the cocoa-powdered side.) Lay seam-side down      on a platter, cover loosely with plastic wrap and      refrigerate for at least three hours before serving.    </p>    <p>      To serve, cut the roll into one-inch slices with a serrated      knife, drizzle with warm chocolate sauce and enjoy.    </p>    <h3>      Cranberry Steamed Pudding    </h3>    <p>      This antique recipe is really more of a cake without any      fat. The fat is in the sauce, which is why it's drizzled on      the cake sparingly. This recipe is so simple, to make that      the most difficult part is finding a metal Jell-O mold. I      found a round one (8f" in diameter with a hole in the      center) for $1 at the Salvation Army store, but you'll find      you can usually borrow one from an elderly neighbor or      relative. You can also use the individual-size metal molds,      though they'll take less cooking time. You'll also need a      vegetable steamer, which, if you don't already have one,      can be purchased at most department stores for well under      $10    </p>    <p>      1/4 cup raw cranberries<br />      1/3 cup molasses<br />      1/3 cup boiling water<br />      2 tablespoons brown sugar pinch salt<br />      1/2 cups unbleached white flour<br />      1/2 teaspoon baking soda vegetable oil      cooking spray    </p>    <p>      Set the cranberries aside. Put an inch or so of water in a      large soup pot with a lid. Open the collapsible vegetable      steamer and place it in the pot. The water should be just      touching the bottom of the steamer. Place the pot on top of      the stove and preheat the water. Place the Jell-O mold on      top of the vegetable steamer to be sure it fits in the pot,      then remove. Spray the interior of the Jell-O mold      generously with cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, stir      together the molasses, water, sugar and salt. Stir in the      flour, baking soda and cranberries. Spoon into the Jell-O      mold and place the mold in the pot. Adjust the heat to the      lowest simmer setting, put on the lid and simmer for one      hour (I actually steam mine for closer to 70 minutes).    </p>    <p>      The cranberry pudding is ready when an inserted toothpick      comes out clean (test in a few spots). When you remove the      lid, be careful not to drip water on the pudding. Remove      the mold from the pan and place it on a cooling rack for at      least 30 minutes. To release the pudding from the mold,      loosen all the edges with a butter knife. Invert onto a      waxed-paper-lined plate and wiggle the mold to loosen. If      that doesn't work, use the butter knife to pry the pudding      away from the sides of the mold in spots, then invert      again. Slice into wedges and drizzle with brandy sauce.    </p>    <p>      *Note: I wrapped the leftover pudding loosely in a plastic      bag and kept it on the kitchen counter for three days. It      kept well the whole time, but I think it tasted best the      day after I made it still fresh, though not quite as moist      as the first day.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Brandy Sauce</em></strong> <em><br />      1/4 cup unsalted butter cup<br />      1/2 sugar<br />      1/4 cup cream<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      1 tablespoon brandy (or rum)</em>    </p>    <p>      In a medium saucepan, melt the butter and sugar on      medium-low heat until it turns a golden color. Whisk in the      cream and simmer a minute or so until the sauce has      thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and      brandy. Drizzle over each slice of cranberry pudding. This      sauce can he refrigerated until needed and then reheated.    </p>    <h3>      Snowball Cookies    </h3>    <p>      Years ago, before I was married, my friend Sarah and I      combined our efforts with a Christmas cookie baking day at      my place. At the time, we had only one recipe apiece, so it      wasn't exactly the Pillsbury Bake-off. Her Irish      grandmother's recipe for snowballs had been her favorite      holiday cookie when she was growing up in Chicago. I've      reduced the sugar and fat, and although I'm not in favor of      using margarine on a regular basis, it does make a lighter      tasting cookie. I usually double the recipe and put some in      the freezer for after the holidays.*    </p>	<p>			<em>1/2 sticks butter or soy margarine (I use half butter    half margarine.)<br />    1/2 cup powdered sugar<br />    1 teaspoon vanilla<br />    1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />    2 cups sifted whole wheat pastry flour (or unbleached white    flour)<br />    1 cup quick-cooking oats (thin oats)<br />    1 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans<br /></em><br />	</p>	    <p>      About an hour before baking, unwrap the butter and      margarine and place in a large mixing bowl to soften. When      the butter is soft, preheat the oven to 325°F. Using an      electric mixer, beat the butter and margarine until creamy.      Add the sugar, vanilla, and baking soda and beat again      until smooth. Sift the flour into measuring cups until      they're overflowing; level with the dull side of a knife.      Slowly mix in the flour until blended. Scrape the beaters      clean and remove the bowl from the mixer.    </p>    <p>      Using a wooden spoon, stir in the oats and nuts. Roll the      dough into one-inch balls and place an inch apart on two      large cookie sheets. (If the dough is too sticky, put the      bowl in the freezer for about five minutes.) Bake 20 to 25      minutes, until light brown. Let cool for one minute. Roll      each ball in a shallow bowl of powdered sugar until      covered. Cool thoroughly (about one hour) on paper towels      before placing them in tins and storing them in a cool      place.    </p>    <p>      Storing and freezing snowballs: These cookies taste best      for the first week, after which they tend to lose flavor.      Pack the cookies in a metal tin or plastic freezer      container, placing a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap      between each layer. Put plastic wrap over the top layer and      store in a cool place or freeze up to one month.    </p>    <h3>      Date-Nut Crunchies    </h3>    <p>      A co-worker used her mother's recipe for these holiday      cookies, a big hit at last year's Christmas party. The      recipe called for maraschino cherries, but I replaced them      with dried cherries for a healthier cookie without red      dyes. What I like about this chewy cookie is that the only      fat is in the walnuts (go ahead and put them in; nuts are      good for you in moderation).<br />    </p>    <p>      <em> 2 cups pitted dates (Make sure they're pliable and      not hard.)<br />      1 cup walnuts<br />      1 cup dried cherries or cranberries<br />      2/3 cup confectioners sugar<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      2 egg whites, not beaten</em><br />    </p>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two cookie sheets with      parchment paper. Chop the dates and nuts into pieces. In a      large bowl, mix together all the ingredients, stirring in      the vanilla and egg whites last. Drop the batter onto the      parchment paper with a tablespoon, so the blobs of dough      are about 2" in diameter. Flatten the cookies slightly with      the spoon and shape them into circles, if needed. Place a      dried cherry or cranberry in the middle of each one if you      like.    </p>    <p>      Bake for 15 minutes until the edges are lightly browned.      Let cookies cool on the baking sheets for at least 10      minutes (they'll harden as they cool) before removing them      from the parchment with a pancake turner. Cool completely      before storing in an airtight tin, with wax paper between      the cookie layers. They'll keep in a cool place for two to      three weeks. I don't recommend freezing these cookies.    </p>    <h3>      Freezing Holiday Cookies and Bars    </h3>        <p>      Our grandmothers didn't have a large freezer to get a jump      on the holidays, but we can start our holiday baking      shortly after Thanksgiving to avoid the last minute rush.    </p>    <p>      To store and freeze cookies, stock up on metal cookie tins      or square/rectangular plastic freezer containers when      they're on sale at discount department stores. (Buy      decorative smaller tins to use for gift cookies.) Make sure      the cookies are completely cooled. Cut bars into small      squares. Line a cookie tin or plastic container with enough      plastic wrap so that it hangs over the sides of the tin.      Line the inside of the container with plastic wrap, then      pack the cookies in, placing a piece of wax paper or      plastic wrap between each layer. Wrap plastic wrap over the      top layer and store in a cool, dark place or freeze up to      one month. Cookies will stay fresher in a zero-degree      deep-freeze than they will in your refrigerator freezer,      where the door is constantly opening, causing the      temperature to fluctuate and food to defrost.    </p>
