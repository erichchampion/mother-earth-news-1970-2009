                    <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>        <p>      I have only to descend a few steps to the cellar to pick      sweet, rosy stalks of rhubarb all winter long.    </p>    <p>      In the fall, after frost has killed the top of my rhubarb      but before I apply a winter mulch, I dig a few clumps for      forcing. I choose strong, well-grown roots and get them up      before the ground freezes. I leave them      outdoors-covered with a few inches of sand so they      won't dry out-until they are thoroughly chilled.    </p>    <p>      Rhubarb will not sprout again until it has been through      another "winter" (at least seven weeks of temperatures      below 50째F but above 28째F). When the ground is      thoroughly frozen, I carry the clumps to the cellar and      plant them in bushel baskets or large buckets, packing damp      peat in around the roots. I find the best temperature for      forcing is between 60째F and 70째F. There is no need      for light and only enough water should be added to keep the      roots from drying out.    </p>    <p>      In about four weeks you'll notice pale yellow leaves, but      rosy-red stalks. Pick the stalks when the leaves begin to      darken and before the edges go brown. The taste is superb,      comparing in delicacy with the sweetest peach. The clumps      will keep you in rosy goodness all winter, and in the      spring can either be replanted in the garden to recuperate      or be discarded.    </p>    <p>      <em>Doris E.
