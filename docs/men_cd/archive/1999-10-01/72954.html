                	<p>		Once banned by the government, this traditional English    berry makes a comeback.	</p>	    <h5 id="byline">      by Elaine Moorley    </h5>        <p>      <strong>W</strong>hat are those? is the reaction I most      often get when people see my gooseberries for sale at the      local farmers' market. Usually, the only people who      recognize the small green, pink, red or yellow translucent      berries are those old enough to remember when the federal      government banned the cultivation of gooseberries in the      1930s. Back then, loggers were convinced the gooseberry      bush was helping to spread white pine blister rust, a      disease threatening timber crops at the time. It's been 33      years since the ban was lifted and it's still hard to find      gooseberries in stores, especially outside of a New      England. Which may help to explain why gooseberry lovers      are generally thrilled to find this tart-ripening-to-sweet      fruit at outdoor markets.<br />      <br />      But even before the 1930s, gooseberries were never very      popular in the United States. Then, as now, only a handful      of varieties were available here, compared to the thousands      grown and sold in England, where they've long been a great      favorite. Recently, however, America has shown a renewed      interest in this hardy berry. Some people like them red      ripe, when they're at their sweetest and juiciest, while      others prefer them still green and full of tart flavor.      Regardless, this easy to grow plant always produces large      quantities of delicious and versatile fruit.		</p>	<h3>What are Gooseberry?	</h3>	  <p> 		  Gooseberries belong to the genus      Ribes, along with currants and some related ornamental      shrubs. They are a low-growing bush with fringed leaves      that turn a brilliant red in the fall. The bushes will      thrive in both light shade and full sun and can be planted      to form an edible hedge. The cooler and moister climate of      the northern United States is best for gooseberries. They      can tolerate extremely low temperatures (zone 3), but      cannot survive where summers are extremely hot and dry,      such as in the Southwest.<br />      <br />      Gooseberry varieties fall into two categories: the small      fruited but mildew resistant American gooseberry (Ribes      hirtellum) and the larger European gooseberry (Ribes      uva-crispa). Most all varieties of gooseberries have long      spines, although some are completely thornless. When you're      shopping around for a plant, look for varieties at local      garden centers that are disease resistant, well suited to      the growing conditions in your area and that are said to      have excellent flavor. These days you probably won't find      too many different types of gooseberry plants, but the      recent rediscovery of gooseberries by American fruit      growers and consumers should result in increased research,      variety development and availability.<br />      <br />      For now, Pixwell is a common American variety and is widely      available through mail order nurseries. They are hardy,      productive and almost thornless, but the fruit quality is      not as good as some of the less common varieties. The      Welcome variety, on the other hand, has better flavor than      the Pixwell and produces medium-sized wine-red fruit.      Another common gooseberry, the Hinnonmaki Red, produces an      abundance of delicious red fruit and is mildew resistant.		</p>			<h3>Planting		</h3> 		 <p> 			Before planting gooseberries,      check with your local cooperative extension office or      Department of Agriculture to learn if any growing      restrictions or bans are in effect in your state. Although      the federal prohibition ended in 1966, it's my      understanding that Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina      and Rhode Island still forbid gooseberry planting.      Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Ohio, New Jersey,      Virginia and West Virginia have planting restrictions. Some      states require gooseberries to be planted at least 100 feet      from white pines, since it's believed that the rust spores      can't travel far from the plant.</p><p> You only need to plant one      variety, as the plants are self-fruitful and do not require      cross pollination. A northwest or northern area in partial      shade to sun is the perfect site for gooseberries. If      possible, plant them in a location that is likely to remain      favorable for the duration of their life span, which is      often up to 30 years or more.</p><p> Space the plants at least      five feet apart, farther if you want to be able to mow all      the way around them. A well-drained fertile loam that is      high in organic matter makes the optimum soil. Add compost      or well composted manure to the planting hole and work it      in thoroughly. Keep your gooseberries well watered, just as      you would any newly set out plants. Trim off any broken      branches after planting and mound sawdust or straw mulch      around the base of the plant, as gooseberries do best if      their roots are kept cool in summer. I use a composted      horse manure containing sawdust to mulch and fertilize at      the same time.		</p>		<h3>Caring		</h3>	<p>			  Prune your plants in      early spring before the buds swell. A good pair of sharp      clippers is all you need to do the job. Remove older      branches at the base to encourage vigorous new branches to      sprout. Be sure to thin out weak, spindly wood and prune      back the ends of branches that touch the ground. The bushes      may not require much pruning at all until their third      spring. After that, a few minutes of annual trimming will      keep new fruiting wood forming and increase the size of the      berries. Keep in mind that gooseberries can also be grown      on a trellis or trained to grow as a standard.</p><p> Disease and      insect problems are rare in home plantings. My own small      planting has stayed problem free for the 18 years it's been      under my care. As it turns out, gooseberries are fairly      resistant to white pine blister rust after all, so you      shouldn't have to worry about that. However, be sure to      purchase your plants from a reputable nursery to ensure a      disease-free stock and avoid problems with American,      gooseberry mildew. While lime sulfur sprays will control      this disease and are acceptable for organic growers, they      smell awful and can cause phytotoxic reactions. Use them      only as a last resort. As for insects, various caterpillars      may attack the haves or fruit of your bushes. Small scale      infestations are best handled by handpicking the pests off      of your plants. For major infestations of moth and      butterfly larvae, <em>Baccillus thuringensis</em> is an      effective P nontoxic control.</p><p> Birds are fairly easily      deterred from gooseberries (as opposed to blueberries and      cherries). Just throw some netting over the bushes to      extend your harvest season.</p><p> Your bushes may flower the      first spring after planting. The mall white blossoms that      appear in early spring will be abuzz with bees and      hummingbirds. When the berries just start to turn to a      blush pink (early July in Massachusetts), it's time to      begin harvesting them. Some people disagree with me, but I      think the berries are less tasty after they turn entirely      red (or pink).</p><p> Handfuls of the first berries can be picked      quickly and easily and I have no problem avoiding the large      thorns. They are much less of a bother than raspberry or      rose thorns.</p><p> The fresh picked berries will keep well for      several days in the refrigerator. They also freeze nicely      for future use. One gooseberry bush will supply you with      several quarts of berries, enough for multiple pies or      several jars of jam.</p><p> Gooseberries can be a real asset to      the home berry patch, bearing early and dependably for many      years. To my mind, they are an old-fashioned delicacy well      worth rediscovering.			</p>    		<h3>Recipes		</h3>    <p>      <strong>Gooseberry Jam</strong></p><p> I like jam to be sweet, fruity and      spreadable but not runny. I often combine other berries      with gooseberries for a flavorful sweet jam with a tang.      The ability of the jam to thicken will depend on the      ripeness of the fruit, so experiment on a small scale      before doubling or tripling the recipe. If you prefer more      of a tart flavor, you can reduce the amount of sugar and      increase the cooking time.</p><p> Prepare gooseberries by rinsing      well, removing the stem and the tail, and mashing with a      potato masher. Add 3 cups fruit-either all      gooseberries or a half-and-half mix of gooseberries and      strawberries, raspberries or blueberries - to a      large, heavy pot and slowly warm to a boil. The fruit will      more than double while boiling, so be sure the pot you      choose is big enough.</p><p> Stir in 2 cups sugar and combine      well. Increase the heat to high and stir the jam to prevent      it from sticking. Bring to a full rolling boil and boil      till thick, while stirring constantly with a long-handled      stainless-steel spoon. The jam should thicken in 15 or 20      minutes; when it sticks to the spoon, it's reached the      right consistency. Let the jam cool for several hours and      test it for taste and thickness. You can add more sugar and      boil longer if needed. Store in the refrigerator or seal in      jam jars according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>      <strong>Gooseberry Pie</strong></p><p> <em>5 cups stemmed and      tailed gooseberries<br />      1 1/2 cups sugar<br />      4 1/2 tablespoons quick cooking tapioca<br />      1/8 teaspoon salt<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      9" double pie crust</em> Combine first four ingredients and      let stand while you prepare the crust. Preheat oven to      400F. Make your favorite pie crust recipe or borrow mine.</p><p>      <strong>Easy Pie Crust</strong></p><p> <em>2 cups flour<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      2 teaspoons sugar<br />      4 tablespoons butter<br />      4 tablespoons shortening<br />      5 tablespoons water</em> Mix first three ingredients. Using      a pastry knife, work in butter until very smooth. Add      shortening and combine till the lumps are pea-size. Add the      water. Gather dough into a ball, adding more water if      needed. Divide in half and roll out on floured hoard. Form      bottom crust into 9" pie pan, add prepared filling and dot      with the butter. Roll out, fit and seal upper crust, brush      with milk, then sprinkle with sugar and ventilate using a      sharp paring knife or cookie cutters. Bake for ten minutes,      then reduce heat to 350F and hake until golden brown,      approximately 40 to 50 minutes.</p><p> <strong>Gooseberry      Chutney</strong></p><p> <em>3/4 cup vinegar<br />      3/4 cup sugar<br />      1 pint maple syrup<br />      1/2 cup raisins<br />      2 quarts gooseberries<br />      2 ounces gingerroot, peeled and chopped<br />      5 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped 1/2 teaspoon each      allspice and cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      1 large hot chili pepper, cored and chopped finely      (optional)</em></p><p> Boil vinegar, sugar and syrup together in a      large saucepan. Add remaining ingredients and cook slowly      until thick, 2 to 3 hours.    </p>
