                		 <p><em>They've finally moved in on us.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Linn Barnes    </h5>        <p>Their origins steeped in lore and legend, these largish      cats have become the best-selling breed in the country.</p><p>I      had been working for quite some time writing a new piece of      music for harp-guitar and celtic harp and finally arrived      at the most difficult part-finding a title. It was a      straightforward piece with a strong dose of good      old-fashioned country, or pastoralism, about it, so I      wanted an expressive tide, something to stimulate the      imagination.</p><p>In the early morning, I like to work facing      due east, when the angle of the light begins to flood the      crimson curtains and spill onto the pages of the musical      score in front of me. There is a transparency and a calm at      that time of day which I find enhances my ability to      concentrate. At any rate, I was searching for a tide when      one of our cats, Calliope, a Maine coon cat, sashayed      across the table, sat down at the head of my manuscript and      stared directly at me. I think it must have been the effect      of the morning light sweeping through that giant plume of a      tall, or the intensity of her multicolored coat, piercing      green eyes and whiskers spanning what seemed to be half the      table that finally gave me the clue I had been looking for.      I named the piece <em>The Consolations of Calliope.</em></p><p>      Who are these enigmatic creatures, Maine coon cats? Until a      few years ago, I hadn't the foggiest idea. After A, a cat's      a cat, right? Of course not. Until you have witnessed one      of these magnificent animals surveying its domain with      unquestionable superiority, you haven't experienced the      full range of power and control that one of the more      discerning of our domestic species can exert. When      <em>it</em> chooses to. Ask any Maine coon cat. It just      might tell you.</p><p>Maine coon cats originated, obviously      enough, in Maine. The name derives from their resemblance      to raccoons: enormous tail, distinct markings and larger      than average size. According to legend, they are descended      from long-haired tabbies, barn and farm cats that went      feral centuries ago, although in some quarters the myth      persists that they sprang from the unholy (and quite      impossible) union of raccoon and cat. Another theory has it      that the original cats were the pets of sailors and somehow      survived shipwrecks off the rocky Maine coast. In any      event, once in the wild, natural selection shaped the      progenitors of our modem specimen. The tenacious long hair      and greater size certainly appear to be accommodations to      the harsh New England winters and authentic perils of life      in the wild. Since planned breedings of Maine coons are      relatively recent, these cats still hold their strong,      rugged qualities.</p><p>SOMEHOW,Maine coon cats eventually      manipulated their way into "good homes." They first      appeared in cat shows and agricultural fairs during the      1870s. Over the next 20 years they became so firmly      established that by 1895 a brown tabby Maine coon cat had      won top prize at the illustrious Madison Square Show in New      York City. In 19o8 when the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA)      first opened its registry, the fifth cat registered was a      tortoiseshell Maine coon. The breed apparently thrived      until the 1930S when over-breeding and hybridization caused      its popularity to wane. Coon cats remained relatively      obscure until 13 years ago when Barbara Pilchard of      Catch-a-Penny Cattery in Hebron, Maryland, now one of the      country's leading breeders, arrived at the prestigious New      York show with the only contending Maine coon cat. They      have regained their popularity since, and today      consistently contend for Best in Show throughout the      country.</p><p>Unlike other longhairsHimalayans or Persians, for      example-Maine coons do not require intense grooming since      they lack the undercoats typical of most long-haired      breeds. If you've ever owned a Persian, you know de-matting      can be a time-consuming and maddening proposition, probably      sufficient to drive you straight into the Maine coon cat      camp.</p><p>THE size of this breed is its most striking      characteristic: 10 to 15 pounds for females and 15 to 20      pounds for males. There are even a few unsubstantiated      rumors of a <em>purer</em> strain weighing in at over      <em>30</em> pounds, but most experts dismiss this as      fantasy. In any event, 15 to 20 pounds is not your basic      kitty, but a creature of serious proportion. Although they      are perfectly tame and among the more personable of all      breeds, their imposing stature fosters an illusion of      wildness and severity. In fact, their friendliness and      companionabilityterms I would be wary of ascribing to many      cats-no doubt account for their welcome into the human      household. Calliope will follow Allison, my wife and      musical partner, from room to room for hours on end. She      also perches on the table next to Allison while she and I      play lute and celtic harp duets, attentive to the whole      affair and occasionally demanding recognition by reaching      out to strike a discordant note or two on the harp. Now      that's a cat show!</p><p>Maine coon cats come in 58 different      colors. Calliope is what is known as "blue, cream and      white." She is all of that: a dark bluish hue interspersed      with creamy stripes, highlighted at collar and paws with      brilliant white. The fur around the collar fluffs out,      occasionally giving the impression of an Elizabethan      collar. Sometimes in Calliope I see a remote New England      ancestor that once basked somewhere along the wild Maine      coast in the warm sun of a perfect summer afternoon and      consoled itself.</p>    <p>      Linn Barnes, a musician, is a longtime <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> subscriber.    </p>
