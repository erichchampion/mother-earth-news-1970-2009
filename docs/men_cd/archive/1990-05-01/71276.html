            <p>      Issue # 123 May/June 1990    </p>    <p>      KITCHEN GARDEN    </p>        <p>      <em>Grow south-of-the-border food up north.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Susan Sides    </h5>              <p>      <em>If you're like me, you love Mexican food.Yet often when      you eat out, you sense that something's missing. subtlety      or variety, perhaps. Even the absence</em> a healthy zing      should remind you that what you're eating has been      Americanized and is miles removed from the authentic      cuisine.    </p>    <p>      Want to leave those imitative eateries behind? Then come      walk with me down the paths of a true Mexican cafe, one      whose menu is as varied as the seasons. Those tiny paper      lanterns you see guiding your footsteps aren't simply      decorations; they hold the emerald secrets to genuine salsa      verde. The vining tropical arbor overhead conceals both      smooth-flavored fruits and underground hors d'oeuvres.      Gayly strung chile peppers are bordered by an exotic,      frilly-leaved herb on the left and an intriguing, if      weedy-looking, bush on the right.    </p>    <p>      Nice atmosphere, ?no? I told you this place was different.      And best of all, it's right at home-just outside the door.      Alfresco meals are always available in the Mexican Garden      Cafe. Your ticket: a seed catalog; your passport: a hoe.      After all, if you can't dip below the border at the drop of      a sombrero, you can do the next best thing: Bring those      authentic ingredients to maturity in your own backyard.    </p>    <h3>Four Exotic Crops</h3>    <p>      <strong>Tomatillos</strong>(Physalis ixocarpa). Those      papery green lanterns along the Garden Cafe footpath are as      unusual as they are ornamental. Tomatillos have sticky,      walnut-sized, pale green fruits that turn yellow just as      their husks become dry and attractively lacy. Their      sweet-acid flavor is indispensable for many green Mexican      sauces, from the popular salsa verde (uncooked Tomatillo      sauce) to less-offered salsa <em>de Suegra</em>      ("mother-in-law sauce"; she serves it to her daughter's      spouse because le pica mucho, "it bites him a lot").    </p>    <p>      You can start tomatillo seeds outdoors if you have at least      12 weeks of warm weather. In short-summer areas, start them      indoors six to eight weeks before the last frost, and set      plants Out 10 to 12 inches apart after all danger of frost      is past. Those feeble-looking seedlings Will soon grow at      an astonishing rate. As they mature, their stems will bend      over and rest on the ground. just let them sprawl and      create a living mulch.    </p>    <p>      The fruits do best with even moisture; if the soil dries      out and is then heavily watered or rained on, they may      split. But be sure to take a good-sized basket when you go      tomatillo picking: They're as prolific as hamsters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cilantro</strong> (Corian <em>drum</em> sativum).      If you're going to try only one Mexican garden plant this      year, make it cilantro. This leafy herb is a cinch to grow      and adds a bite no salsa should go without. (Yet many do,      for cilantro is best fresh; it loses all flavor when      dried.)    </p>    <p>      There's only one hitch with cilantro: It's quick to go to      seed. Actually, it's been <em>bred</em> to do so because      the seeds themselves are the valuable spice coriander. One      way to counter this quick-seeding tendency is to sow      successive plantings every three weeks. You can also try      one of the slow bolting varieties now available.    </p>    <p>      <em>C. sativum</em> does best in the cool weather of spring      and fall. Its first leaves are fanshaped, much like a cross      between Italian parsley and maidenhair fern. They're the      ones used in cooking. (Subsequent leaves are more      fennel-like.)    </p>    <p>      If you can't tell young plants from surrounding weeds, just      crush a leaf here and there. You'll find the cilantro,      pronto. (Don't judge it by this strong come-on; it mellows      considerably in cooking.) And if you'll want its zip come      winter, try freezing leaves in ice cube trays filled with      water. It's really the only alternative to fresh.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Epazote</strong> <em>(Chenopodium      ambrosioides).</em> Most Americans have never heard of this      important Mexican herbeven though it may be growing wild      where they live. A bushy-looking perennial, epazote      (eh-pah-SO-tay) can reach four feet or higher when well      cared for. Although its family name means ambrosia, "food      of the gods" is hardly what comes to mind when you take      your first whiff of this strong-scented herb. <em>Assertive      is</em> more like it-and that's putting it politely.      Luckily, the flavor is milder than the scent. More honored      as well, it's considered absolutely essential to the      cuisine of central and southern Mexico.    </p>    <p>      One or two plants will be all you'll need. You can start      them outdoors in a warm climate, or indoors a month before      the last frost if you garden up North. Or purchase plants      from a nursery.    </p>    <p>      Your most difficult caretaking task will be keeping family      and friends from weeding it out: Epazote simply does not      look like a legitimate member of the garden. Otherwise it      needs little tending and only occasional watering to supply      fresh leaves all season long.    </p>    <p>      The potent herb will overwinter in areas with mild      climates. In colder regions, try cutting it back to a foot      high and covering with mulch. Or save seeds from one plant      to start seedlings in midsummer for growing indoors. You      can also freeze leaves, as with cilantro, for winter use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chayote</strong> <em>(Sechium edule).</em>      Prolific? I once grew chayote (chah-YOH-tay) in south      Florida, where this heat-loving perennial can really strut      its stuff, and found that it raced headlong up and over      anything in its path. One plant can bear up to 100 fruits      in a season-each with smooth, pale green skin and firm,      nutflavored flesh. The fruit averages five inches in length      and three inches in width and is shaped like a wide-lobed      pear. Spring and early summer shoots can be cut and cooked      like asparagus, while the large tubers, which taste like      potatoes, are used as a main dish.    </p>    <p>      The only problem with raising chayote is that it's very      sensitive to frost. Still, many an adventurous gardener has      stretched its range northward by sprouting it indoors over      the winter. Since the whole fruit is needed for      germination, you can't order seeds but need to locate      starts at a good produce market. Get at least three fruits      (nature sometimes forgets to put both male and female      flowers on the same plant). Let these sprout in a cool,      moist place, then set out as soon as all danger of frost is      past.    </p>    <p>      Chayote likes full sun and plenty of water. Bury each fruit      at about a 450 angle in a well-fertilized mound, with the      small (possibly sprouted) end just sticking out of the      soil.    </p>    <p>      Vines may not flower until late summer or even fall. About      a month later, the fruits will start ripening. Young fruits      are a delicacy when cooked skin, seed and all, but you'll      need to peel mature fruits before using them. Do this under      running water, since the fruit releases a slippery juice      that bothers some people with sensitive skin (it is      entirely harmless when cooked).    </p>    <h3>Three Familiar Crops</h3>    <p>      <strong>Tomatoes</strong> <em>(Lycopersicon lycoper</em>      sicum). The tomato that takes center stage in American seed      catalogs actually comes from the natives of Mexico and      South America. And do they ever know how to use it:      <em>Crudo</em> (raw), <em>cocido</em> (boiled),      <em>asado</em> (charred or grilled), <em>stofado</em>      (stewed), and even <em>enterrado</em> (buried) are just a      few of the ways Mexicans transform what we know as only a      "salad and sauce" vegetable. Try <em>Arroz a la      Mexicana</em> (Mexican Rice), huevos <em>Rancheros</em>      (Ranch Eggs), <em>Salsa Ranchera</em> (Ranch Sauce),      <em>Salsa para Barbacoa</em> (Pit Barbecue Sauce) and      <em>Salsa X-Ni-Pek</em> (Hot-As-a-Dog's-Nose Sauce) for      some culinary eye-openers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chiles</strong> (Capsicum annuum). It's hard to      find a Mexican dish that doesn't have at least a touch of      chile. Since they're also used as medicine, dye, ritual      object and defensive weapon, it's no wonder that Mexicans      consume more (and more types of) chiles than any other      people in the world. The palate accustomed to capsaicin's      sting goes on to detect a wide range of flavor distinctions      and degrees of fleshiness. Add to that the cook's choice of      preparation (peeled, unpeeled, dry, charred, fresh,      pickled, crushed, seeded or veined) and you have a very      eclectic vegetable.    </p>    <p>      There are more chiles out there than there are taste buds      on your tongue. Some common ones:    </p>    <p>      <em>Chile Serrano:</em> A slim one-to-two-inch-long pepper      that's very popular and very hot. Known as the salsa Chile,      serrano is used in many other dishes including guacamole      and Chile con came. It can also be dried and ground into      Chile powder. <em>Chile Jalapeño:</em> The best      known Chile outside Mexico, this thickwalled      jalapeño is from two to three inches long and an      inch across. Ranging from hot to very hot, it's commonly      pickled or used in appetizers, salsas, and meat or      vegetable dishes.    </p>    <p>      <em>Chile Poblano:</em> These wedge-shaped peppers range      from mild to hot, are from three to five inches long and      average three inches across at the shoulders. The poblano's      distinctive flavor is specifically called for in a variety      of dishes, *including chiles rellenos.    </p>    <p>      <em>Chile Piquin:</em> A little of these very small (1/2-      to 1/4-inch long), fiery hot chiles goes a long way. They      need a long growing season, turning a golden red at      maturity.    </p>    <p>      One word of caution: Wear gloves and take full precautions      when handling hot peppers. They can sting you painfully for      up to <em>14</em> hours. Don't answer the telephone, pick      up a child or touch any part of your body when processing      hot peppers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Garlic</strong> <em>(Allium sativum).</em> The      garlic of Mexico is most often the strong, small,      purple-skinned varieties rather than the larger white      cloves most of us are used to. South-of-the-border natives      coax subtle flavoring from this pungent corm with gentle      sauteing, charring, and grinding Unlike some American      garlic lovers (including yours truly), they never let it      overpower other flavors.    </p>    <p>      Garlic is raised like onions or most other alliums, with      one hitch: In the majority of areas, the biggest bulbs come      from crops planted the fall <em>before</em> harvesting. The      hardy plants overwinter well and then have much more time      to put on leaf growth before the long days of late spring      trigger bulb formation.    </p>    <p>      One of the rewards the home garden cafe offers is unending      variety. So if you can't make up your mind what to try      first, relax. You could eat Mexican cuisine from your      garden all season long and never enjoy the same dish twice.    </p>    <p>      Susan Sides, former gardener for    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, lives in western North Carolina, raising      kids and a great variety of vegetables.    </p>    <h3>Susan's First Annual Salsa Celebration</h3>    <p>      IT WAS MID-AFTERNOON LAST SUMMER and the sun had found      every inch of my exposed skin. Every last inchI could even      hear the burned back of my knees crackle each time I knelt.      Across the garden, sombrero-topped Mr. Scarecrow stood      guard over my little Mexican patch. Suddenly I could have      sworn I saw him pull a margarita from underneath his poncho      and sneak a sip. Good idea, I thought. Let's party.    </p>    <p>      As you see, it doesn't take much of an excuse for my      friends and me to get together. Throw in the challenge to      see who weeps last, and you've got a sure thing. Thus, our      First Annual Tongue-Tormenter's Salsa Tasting was born We      lured a gang of neighbors over and warned each one.      Everyone from wimp lips to flame swallowers participated,      and a hot time was had by all.    </p>    <p>      Want to join the fun this year? Invite some friends over      and try the recipes, Salsa Verde and Salsa Cruda, below. I      suggest a broad range of Chile peppers so you can adjust      the flame to your own preference or that of the less      courageous of your invitees. But if you go for the high      numbers, I'll wager both you and your guests will be      smiling through your tears.    </p>    <h3>Salsa Verde</h3>    <p>      1 pound (approximately 20) fresh tomatillos<br />      1 large clove garlic<br />      1/2 small white onion<br />      1 tablespoon to 1/2 cup chopped cilantro<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)<br />      Dashes of vinegar or lemon juice to taste<br />      Zero <em>(foul!)</em> to 4 <em>(fool!)</em> hot green      chiles    </p>    <p>      Wash and remove husks from tomatillos, then simmer in very      little water for a few minutes until tender. In a blender      or food processor, combine 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid      with the garlic, onion, cilantro, salt and vinegar or lemon      juice and blend until almost smooth. Add drained tomatillos      and chiles and pulse process until the ingredients are      broken up but still chunky.    </p>    <h3>Salsa Cruda</h3>    <p>      4 large ripe tomatoes<br />      1 medium white onion<br />      1/2, teaspoon salt<br />      Up to 1/3 cup chopped cilantro<br />      1 large clove garlic Pinch of black pepper<br />      1 tablespoon vinegar<br />      2 to 4 fresh green chiles Pinch of sugar (optional)<br />      1 small stalk celery (optional)    </p>    <p>      The tomatoes and chiles can be used processed raw in the      same order as for the salsa verde above. However, to give      the dip a lingering, smoky flavor, first roast the tomatoes      and chiles over an open fire (or under a broiler oven unit)      until the skins blister and char. Let cool and remove the      skins before processing.    </p>
