                    <h5 id="byline">      by Douglass Lea    </h5>            <p>      I'VE always tried to be good. As a kid, I made my bed      whenever possible. Later I joined the Peace Corps-mostly      for the adventure, I hate to admit. Now I do green things.      I separate my garbage, grow a garden without pesticides,      drive a fuel-efficient car. Trendy, but still not wholly      satisfying.    </p>    <p>      OUR times cry out for a larger response, an enterprise that      matches the magnitude of the environmental emergency.      Something in me envies Mother Teresa. She knows how to      respond. I listen to Eastern Europeans, hoping to discover      the secret of their recent miracles. "The salvation of this      human world lies nowhere else than in ... human      responsibility," Vaclav Havel, new president of      Czechoslovakia, tells the U.S. Congress. "We are still      incapable of understanding that the only genuine backbone      of our actions, if they are to be moral, is      responsibility." Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz, winner of the      <em>198o</em> Nobel Prize in literature, writes in      <em>Granta:</em> "What remains today is the idea of      responsibility, which works against the loneliness and      indifference of an individual living in the belly of a      whale." I am left with a quest: What is the link between      the environmental catastrophe and personal responsibility?    </p>    <p>      Try being a vegetarian, suggests my neighbor, who later      drops off Ellen Buchman Ewald's <em>Recipes for a Small      Planet,</em> first published in <em>1973.</em> It turns out      my neighbor is a "beady eyed" vegetarian, her own      description. She is perfectly willing to eat the flesh of      fish and chicken, who have beady eyes, according to her,      but not that of cuddly creatures with big brown eyes-not      pandas, obviously, and not bears and pigs and sheep and      certainly not Bessie and Bambi. Highly sentimental, I think      to myself, and not much of a sacrifice, certainly not for      someone who lives in Ralph Lauren country, where the      calories count and the wine is white. She would appear      perfectly normal in those circles. Her path is not exactly      mine. So my search continues.    </p>        <p>      Try vegetarianism, insists my student, handing me a      dog-eared copy of Peter Singer's <em>Animal      Liberation,</em> also first published in the early      <em>'70s</em> and reissued this year with a lavish      publicity campaign. Needless to say, she supports the      animal-rights movement, and her advice is essentially      ideologicalthat is, anchored in a new ethic for the      treatment of animals. The vegetables 'in this kind of      vegetarianism are beside the point, for they serve chiefly      as an alternative to the killing and eating of animals. As      one who has whispered sweet nothings to plants and seen      them grow healthy and strong in response, I have come to      doubt the moral superiority of cows over cowpeas.    </p>    <p>      The ideology of this rapidly growing movement still implies      an evolutionary hierarchy, with the human species in the      penthouse, the animal kingdom in the middle and the      botanical world in the basement. It seems to me this      value-loaded stratification <em>Turn the previous page      upside down for face two, Is the steer (right) really      "superior" to a tomato?</em> is equally useful to those who      enjoy eating meat. "Let's eat the losers, say modem      Darwinists in pinstripes as they happily head toward a      power lunch at a fancy steakhouse. They want it allthe meat      <em>and</em> the potatoes-and make no bones about it. I      admire their relentless consistency; it's just their      environmental sensitivities that leave me hungering for      something else.    </p>        <p>      Try eating vegetables, says my wife, whose interests      include saving money on food and keeping me fit for work.      She gives me a book also: <em>The Vegetarian Epicure,</em>      by Anna Thomas, which first appeared 'in <em>1972</em> and      is still available. Eating more vegetables and less meat      speaks to my frugal soul. Dan Rather never says, "Romanian      peasants are tightening belts tills winter; some have only      steaks for dinner and won't see a cabbage for months." When      peasants are in trouble, they get vegetables, not beef Lack      of meat, wrote anthropologist Marvin Harris, poses a direct      revolutionary threat to totalitarian regimes. In 1981, for      example, the Polish government called for a 20% cut in meat      rations and then had to declare martial law to restore      order. Since I share some of the peasant's worldview but      live in affluence, I have to save up for the tough winters      ahead; and moving toward the vegetable end of the spectrum      looks like a good way to take responsibility for the      environmental consequences of my actions. But I also know      that an intense craving for meat can suddenly strike-and,      in my case, be swiftly satisfied.    </p>    <p>      In 1983, 1 was invited to join a small group that meets for      a week every year to discuss organizational change. Our      meetings take place at a famous health-and self spa      south of Big Sur, California. Sometimes the founder of the      institution joins our discussions. The 1983 session, my      first, went well, but by the end of the week my body was in      full revolt against the regime of sprouts and lettuce. So      was the founder's. We formed a secret, carnivorous alliance      to find hamburgers. Late that night, while a Pacific storm      hurled rain, fog and angry waves at the mountains that      plunge into the ocean, we slipped out the back door,      tiptoed to his car and sped off to negotiate the dark,      slippery hairpins on the coastal highway. Around midnight,      after skirting landslides and other dangers, we found our      meat. The pleasure lingers.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, it doesn't take much to convince me that a      diet laden with fruits, nuts, seeds, grains, legumes and      other fresh vegetables will keep my heart healthier, weight      lower, spirits higher, steps bouncier and sex life      friskier.    </p>        <p>      In mulling over these old books, I suddenly remembered      their common inspirationthe seminal <em>Diet for a Small      Planet</em> by Frances Moore Lappe, which first attracted      attention in 1971 and has since sold over 3 million copies.      I picked up my old copy again and began to read. It soon      dawned on me that her message-changing one's diet helps      prevent mass hunger and environmental disaster-had only      become more significant and relevant in the intervening      years. My quest came to a close. I now know how to be good      in the '90s.    </p>    <p>      The secret lies in accepting the broad environmental      framework that Lappe constructed to support vegetarianism.      It works today. All it needs is a little rehabilitation and      polishing. Lappe saw the crisis long before <em>ozone      bole</em> and <em>greenhouse effect</em> had become      household words. She analyzed the inherent waste and      destructiveness of a meat-eating world. When I eat meat,      according to Lappe's vision, I'm eating the environment.    </p>    <p>      "Our daily choices about food connect us to a worldwide      economic system," Lappe' said in 1987. "Even an apparently      small change-consciously choosing a diet that is good both      for our bodies and for the earthcan lead to a series of      choices that transform our whole lives." From this      perspective, vegetarianism is far more than just a flaky      remnant of the '70sit's the key to conservation, and to a      sense of personal responsibility for the environment. Do we      genuinely want to make a difference? The hard facts      indicate the kind of impact we can make with a dietary      change. And that impact is profound.    </p>        <p>      CONSIDER, for example, water. More than half of U.S. water      consumption goes to raising beef It takes 25 gallons to      produce a pound of wheat, but 2,500 for a pound of meat. In      one day, the diet for a meat eater requires 4,000 gallons      of water; for a true vegetarian, only 300. That contrast      amounts to real conservation. It also means fewer dams and      more water left in streams for beady-eyed fish.    </p>    <p>      Some 90% of the water pollution that results from organic      wastes is attributed to livestock. The inorganic residues      of pesticides are also overwhelmingly caused by meat      production (55%) and dairy operations (23%). For example,      American corn production, which is predominantly oriented      toward the feeding of livestock, uses 30 million pounds of      toxic chemicals annually to control the corn borer. Only      11% of combined pesticide residuals come from the growing      of vegetables, fruits and grains. And even that small      percentage should decline as organic gardening and      agriculture continue to spread.    </p>    <p>      Consider greenhouse gases-those carbon dioxides and      methanes that trap escaping heat and raise the earth's      temperature. Many experts say the accumulation of      greenhouse gases in the upper atmosphere could lead, in two      short generations, to a global warming that will have      catastrophic effects-expanding deserts, flooded coastal      areas, loss of species and genetic diversity and massive      dislocations in agriculture.    </p>    <p>      Combustion of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and      contributes heavily to the greenhouse effect, yet the      fossil-fuel energy to produce one pound of feedlot beef      would grow <em>40</em> pounds of soybeans, the chief      ingredient in tofu delights and hamburger extenders. (A      mixed blessing, I must admit. Whenever my wife goes on a      "cleansing diet," I become submerged in such soybean      concoctions. Sometimes my willpower is weak. In early      March, during a cleansing episode, I sneaked out one night      to get a juicy porterhouse at a nearby restaurant.) If all      earthlings were meat eaters, global petroleum reserves      would disappear by the year 2003; if vegetarians, by 2250.      That gap constitutes a big cushion of security-long enough      to develop alternative sources of energy and modes of      transport. National security would also be cushioned: If      only 10% of my fellow Americans stopped eating meat, oil      imports would no longer be necessary.    </p>    <p>      Major sources of methane are the digestive tracts of higher      mammals, including those raised for food. By reducing their      numbers, we therefore decrease the habitat for      methane-producing organisms. In the United States alone,      livestock animals manufacture a full 250,000 pounds of      manure every second.    </p>    <p>      In looking further into the environmental argument for      vegetarianism, I was drawn to the tragedy of tropical rain      forests, which are being cut and burned at a staggering      rate. Here again, I quickly discovered, the eating of meat      is a crucial element. Much of the clearing is done to      -create ephemeral pastures for animals that end up on North      American dinner plates. A couple of years ago, Burger King      stopped using rain forest beef; consumer pressure played at      least a partial role in its decision. Labor is cheap and      land is even cheaper. Profits are almost unavoidable.      Tropical soils are thin, however, and the new grazing lands      are soon depleted, forcing a migration deeper into virgin      stands of forest. Abandoned pastures erode and become      virtual deserts, watersheds become mudsheds and      hydroelectric reservoirs become silted and useless. In the      end, after suffering deforestation, floods and malnutrition      in order to grow filet mignon, the people of Costa Rica,      for example, eat less meat than does the average North      American house cat. Central American countries, meanwhile,      export 200 million pounds of meat annually.    </p>        <p>      Back in the United States, more than half of all      agricultural lands are used to raise beef, an allocation      that carries serious cost implications. Furthermore, it      takes 16 pounds of grain and soybeans to produce one pound      of feedlot beef, five pounds of protein must be fed to      chickens to produce one pound of chicken protein, and      almost eight pounds to hogs for one pound of pork protein.      When grain is fed to livestock, most of its protein      <em>(90%),</em> carbohydrates (100%) and dietary fiber      (100%) is wasted. An acre of land-my backyardcan produce      20,000 pounds of potatoes but only 165 pounds of beef,      approximately 20 pure vegetarians can be fed on the amount      of land needed to feed a single meat eater.    </p>    <p>      I must admit that a desire for a better environment and      good nutrition for all humankind are only part of the      attraction. If truth be told, I envy Mother Teresa's long      life as much as I admire her good works. And a meat-free      diet, I have learned on this journey, may even prolong      life. Certainly Frances Moore Lappe's book argues that      point, and research conducted by Seventh Day Adventists      (vegetarians themselves) at the Loma Linda University      Medical Center in California, supports it as well.    </p>    <p>      MARVIN Harris, on the other hand, contends that "while      plant foods can sustain life, access to animal foods      bestows health and well-being above and beyond mere      survival." That's food for thought, but we may have, *in      fact, already despoiled our planetary habitat to the degree      that "mere survival" is the appropriate level at which to      begin again. Dr. Murray E. Jarvik, inventor of the      artificial heart, writes, "The moral is clear: Despite the      fact that our ancestors loved meat and that we do, too, it      carries with it the danger of heart disease."    </p>    <p>      In the end, as Havel and Milosz 'insist, it all boils down      to a sense of personal responsibility. Perhaps      responsibility for the health of the global environment      begins with responsibility for personal health. The rates      for cancer, for example, are indicators of widespread      failure of personal and social responsibility. Need I      emphasize that they are alarmingly high among meat, dairy      and egg eaters? The strong correlation between meat      consumption and colon cancer is well-known, and breast      cancer is four times higher for women who eat meat daily      than for those who consume it less than once a week. Cases      of fatal prostate cancer are three and a half times greater      among men who eat meat, eggs and dairy foods daily than      among those who rarely eat such products. Such are the      wages of environmental sin.    </p>    <p>      In rejecting vegetarianism out of hand, many may be      following a high-speed highway to personal and global      destruction. In reinforcing the new diseases of affluence,      we are eating our very lives. At the beginning of this      search I was trying to be good. Now I'm also trying to be      well-and responsible. What really intrigues me is that a      good part of the solution to our global ills may lie in our      dear old vegetable patch. I think I will try whispering      more than sweet nothings to the broccoli this morning.    </p>    <p>      Douglass Lea, a.k.a. Dr. Viggie Legume, is a gardener and      writer.
