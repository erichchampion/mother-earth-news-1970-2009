                    <h5 id="byline">      Story and photos by Brook Elliott    </h5>        <p>      You've seen the ads: "Now you <em>can have dark, rich      compost in just a few weeks!"</em> What an appealing      message. Whether you grow flowers, vegetables, herbs or      houseplants, compost is "black gold" in the garden. We      never have enough of it, and can't make it fast enough.      Compost tumblers, the ads say, can give us a steady supply      every couple of weeks. Designed so you can crank, turn or      roll the container to turn and aerate the compost, tumblers      come in several sizes.    </p>    <p>      Before you run out and buy one, however, be aware that      those headlines are advertising hyperbole at best. In our      tests, tumblers did not produce finished compost any faster      than a well-managed compost bin or open pile.    </p>    <p>      To be sure, the ingredients appear to be composting faster      because you are likely to turn the contents more often in a      tumbler, thus introducing air-one of the four vital      ingredients (the others being nitrogen, carbon and      water)-that is necessary to turn vegetable matter      into compost. But if you build an open pile the same size      as a tumbler's capacity, use the same ingredients in both      and turn the open pile whenever you rotate the tumbler,      they will produce compost in the same general time frame.      So, why should you buy a compost tumbler?    </p>    <p>      Last summer we conducted a field test of various compost      tumblers versus open compost piles. Although most of us at      MOTHER use cold composting methods (substituting time for      the work of maintaining a hot pile), we ran a hot pile as a      control.    </p>    <p>      Under our environmental conditions, both the open (hot)      pile control and the tumblers yielded rich, finished      compost in about 10 weeks-a far ay from the 14 days      some of the manufacturers claim. The tumblers were      certainly easier to use than turning an open pile with a      pitchfork, but they did not appreciably increase the speed      of production when compared to a properly managed open      pile. Ease of turning is probably the main benefit tumblers      offer, but as you will see below, some are easier to turn      than others.    </p>    <p>      Although the decomposition time is not increased, compost      tumblers do have advantages in addition to ease of turning.      By and large, they are clean, neat, unobtrusive,      pest-resistant and odor-free. Because of this, tumblers      often can be used in urban and suburban areas, where local      laws or restrictive covenants may prohibit open compost      piles.    </p>    <p>      One pleasant surprise during the testing, in what turned      out to be a drought year, was that the enclosed tumblers      retained moisture better than the open pile, which had to      be watered frequently.    </p>    <h3>      TUMBLER STYLES    </h3>    <p>      Compost tumblers fall into four general categories based on      their construction:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Crank-operated drums.</strong> A horizontally      mounted drum rests on a raised framework. A crank assembly      lets you turn the drum easily, while the internal baffles      help mix the materials, adding air.    </p>    <p>      Because the drums are raised relatively high, emptying them      is simple. Merely push a wheelbarrow under the drum,      position the door and open it. Compost pours directly into      the wheelbarrow.    </p>    <p>      This style of tumbler tends to cost about twice as much as      other styles. But, as with anything else, you get what you      pay for. In this case, you trade money for ease of      operation.    </p>    <p>      The Mantis ComposTwin (Page 105) and the ComposTumbler      (Page 108) are examples of this design; the former has a      double drum and the latter has a single drum (available in      two sizes).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Center-axle drums.</strong> A vertically mounted      drum rotates around a central, horizontal axle supported by      a wood, metal or PVC frame. Operation is generally easy,      particularly with the models that have doors on both ends.      The central axle acts to break up and mix the materials.      Most of these tumblers are mounted low to the ground,      however, so emptying them can be a chore unless you have a      low-boy wheelbarrow that happens to fit under them.    </p>    <p>      The Urban Compost Tumbler (UCT) and the Tumbleweed are this      type.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Base rolling drums.</strong> A horizontally      configured drum rolls on a ground-level base. Some of them      actually have rollers, while others have molded rounded      points to suspend the drum and let it rotate. Obviously,      the tumblers with rollers are easier to turn. To help make      rotating easier, several of this style have steps molded      into the body, so you can use your feet and legs to turn      them, thus theoretically easing back strain.    </p>    <p>      Because the base rolling tumblers virtually sit on the      ground, emptying them can be awkward. You have to shovel      the compost out-through relatively small      openings-rather than pouring it.    </p>    <p>      Typical of this design are the Envirocycle, the Step-down      Composter and the EZ Composter    </p>    <h3>      Roll-around spheres    </h3>        <p>      These are giant molded angu lar balls that you fill with      composting material and then roll around your yard. The      idea is initially intriguing; in practice, however, they      tend to he the most awkward to use and the most difficult      to empty.    </p>    <p>      Roll-around composters are not really round, but are      faceted like a geodesic dome. As a result. they only roll      on what would be their equator. And, instead of rolling      like a snowball, they swing to the left or right in sharp      arcs. The heavier they are loaded, the less control you      have.    </p>    <p>      The Bio Orb (left) and the Large Batch Composter are      examples of this style.    </p>		      <h3>      FEATURE PROS AND CONS    </h3>        <p>      Once you have decided which kind of tumbler you want, look      at the specific features of each. It's the little things      that can make or break a design.    </p>    <p>      For instance, compare the Envirocycle to the EZ Composter.      The former has a hinged door. The latter has a round hatch      with finely threaded screws. As a result, loading and      unloading the Envirocycle is considerably easier than      loading and unloading the EZ Composter, which has a hatch      that is difficult to screw down even when the unit is new,      let alone after dirt and debris clog the threads.    </p>    <p>      Among center-axle types, some, such as the Tumbleweed, open      at both ends, while others, such as the Urban compost      Tumbler., open only atone end. Having openings on both ends      makes loading and unloading simpler. However, the extra air      flow of the UCT's patented core-aeration system, which      precludes having both ends open, might he worth the      trade-off.    </p>    <p>      Capacity also can be an issue. Many models come in more      than one size. At first blush, the larger size seems to      make sense because it produces more compost in the same      amount of time as a smaller one. But the larger one also      might he heavier and more difficult to operate.    </p>        <p>      There's another aspect of capacity to consider. Composting      speed is a function of the last items to he added. That is,      you won't get a full load of compost unless you've put in a      full load of organic material. This doesn't mean you can't      add material a little at a tune. What it does mean,      however, is that "time to completion" is measured from the      last of those small additions.    </p>    <p>      Because of this, you may want to have more than one unit.      Start by completely filling one with a mixture of brown and      green compost material. Examples of brown material are fine      mood chips, brown weeds, straw, leaves and kitchen scraps;      examples of green material are grass clippings, green      garden cast-offs and manure.    </p>    <p>      While that batch "cooks," you can slowly fill another unit.    </p>    <p>      This is the idea behind the ComposTwin: You can have one      bin filled and composting while you are adding fresh      ingredients to the second bin.    </p>    <h3>      OPERATING FACTORS    </h3>    <p>      Whichever unit you choose, you should be aware of certain      operational factors:    </p>        <p>      1) <strong>Ignore recommendations to use compost      accelerators.</strong> About half the manufacturers still      recommend this practice, yet study after study has shown      that such additives have no appreciable effect on the      composting process.    </p>    <p>      2) <strong>The proportion of green material to brown is      more crucial</strong> in a closed tumbler than in an open      pile. If you don't add at least 40 percent browns, you'll      end up with a slimy, smelly mess instead of compost.    </p>    <p>      If nothing else is available, keep a bag of leaves or a      bale of straw handy and use it as necessary to maintain the      balance. In most cases where users have reported poor      results, it turns out they have been adding only grass      clippings and kitchen scraps to the unit.    </p>    <p>      3) All tumblers are pest-proof to rodents, dogs and other      animals-not to insects. When you open a tumbler.      <strong>Be prepared for a cloud of gnats</strong> to      emerge. The fact is, these same gnats hover over open      compost piles, but you are less aware of them because you      don't encounter them in mass.    </p>    <p>      4) <strong>Monitor the moisture content.</strong> Tumblers      retain moisture letter than open piles, so you don't need      to add much. Usually, grass clippings alone provide more      than enough moisture. Your working pile should feel like a      clamp sponge.    </p>    <p>      If its wetter than that, leave the door open awhile so it      can dry out. Occasionally you may have to add a small      amount of water. If so, add no more than a cup at a time,      and be sure to tumble the contents after each addition.    </p>    <p>      5) <strong>Air is crucial to the composting      process.</strong> Periodically check to ensure the vents in      your composter haven't been clogged by organic material. If      you think the mix isn't getting enough air, rotate tile      tumblers more frequently.    </p>    <h3>      Compost Tumbler Sources    </h3>    <p>      <strong>ComposTwin:</strong> Mantis.
