                    <p>      <em>Here's how to ensure your final resting place is earth      friendly and priced right.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      <em>By Nancy Smith</em>    </h5>    <p>      A typical, no-frills funeral and burial in the United      States costs from $6,000 to $10,000, uses formaldehyde in      embalming, nondegradable steel caskets and concrete vaults      placed shoulder to shoulder in established cemeteries.    </p>    <p>      Burial in a green or natural cemetery, on the other hand,      can cost half as touch, and embalming mortal caskets and      concrete burial vault's are prohibited. Instead,      biodegradable caskets, usually made of wood or cardboard,      or burial shrouds of natural fibers are used. Green      cemetery graves are placed randomly throughout a woodland      or meadow, and marked only in natural ways, with the      planting of a tree or shrub, or the placement of a flat      indigenous stone, which may or may not be engraved. Burial      locations are mapped with a GIS (geographic information      system), so future generations can locate an ancestors      final resting place.    </p>    <p>      There are more than 200 green cemetery its in Great      Britain, and the idea is beginning to catch on here in      North America. Lisa Carlson is executive, director of the      Funeral Consumers Alliance in South Burlington, Vermont,      and author of <em>Caring for the Dead</em> <em>,</em> which      tackles the topic of funeral law state by state. She      reports embalming, expensive caskets anti concrete vaults      are: not required by law in any state. Bodies can be kept      cool until burial rather than being embalmed and cemeteries      require vaults only to prevent soil settling and facilitate      grass mowing.    </p>    <p>      The leader in the emerging green-cemetery business in this      country, Carlson says, are Dr. Billy and Kimberley Campbell      of Memorial Ecosystems, founded in 1996 in Westminster      South Carolina. Their idea is to Use green cemeteries to      preserve open space. You can be buried at the Campbells      first green cemetery, Ramsey Creek Preserve, in      Westminster, and visitors can walk on trails through 32      acres of mixed Woodlands and open fields there.    </p>    <p>      In Florida, a green cemetery called Glendale Memorial      Preserve is being established to save a 350-acre family      farm from development. And groups in several other states,      inducting Colorado, California, New York, Washington and      Wisconsin, have efforts under way to established green      cemeteries that center on land preservation. In Canada, the      Memorial Society of British Columbia also has a formally      funded green-burial initiative under way.    </p>    <p>      The first burial at Ramsey Creek Preserve occurred in the      fall of 1998; to date, 17 more have taken place. Another 50      persons have purchased sites. A casket burial there costs      about $2,500. Burial of cremated remains is only $500;      scattering of cremated remains is $250. Stone grave markers      and engraving are optional; the stones are $25; engraving      ranges from $125 to $300. Caskets are not included. (For      instructions on building your own casket, see Page 61.)    </p>    <p>      Dr. Campbell says people seem to want to be buried there      because of the site's natural beauty, the lower cost and      the land preservation effort. Bodies usually arrive for      burial at Ramsey Creek Preserve via a local, independent      funeral home, whose owner has agreed to hold them under      refrigeration until delivery to the preserve. The nature of      any graveside ceremony is determined by the families.      "Whatever spiritual bent you bring to the preserve, our      natural landscape is very healing," Kimberley Campbell      says. "What we do is very simple, but there is something      very, very special about the simplicity of it."    </p>    <p>      Sherrill Hughes buried her husband, Roland, at Ramsey Creek      Preserve. She says she knows without a doubt that was what      he would have wanted. His body was placed in a simple pine      box-a preference he had expressed-and buried      under a dogwood tree; her grave site is right next to his,      and she says her children all want to be buried there, too.      "Roland's funeral was so personal. In most funerals there's      no emotion, but at Ramsey Creek, you can do what you want."      She played his favorite songs Dolly Parton's "I Will Always      Love You" and George Jones' "He Stopped Loving Her      Today"-and placed the first spade full of dirt in his      grave.    </p>    <p>      Following her lead; their children shoveled too, "and      before we knew it, the boys-my two sons-in- and nephew -      had nearly finished tilling in the grave."    </p>    <p>      Hughes, who lives in Atlanta, says she wouldn't describe      herself or her husband as environmentalists. Rather. they      always just tried to take care of what God had given them,      "and that included the Earth." She plans to move to the      Westminster area soon, where most of her family al ready      lives, and she plans on building her own casket and helping      out as a volunteer at the preserve.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Campbell says folks buried there so far fit a range of      descriptions, and the majority are not      environmentalists-which is exciting to him. Going      through a green burial process helps people get beyond the      "nature as wallpaper" mentality, he explains. The only      medical doctor in Westminster, he has a longtime interest      in the environment (in 1986, he helped found the South      Carolina Forest Watch, a group that monitors the well-being      of the state's forests) and he has been dealing with death      since his medical school days; his wife thinks it's a      reassuring combination to their patrons. She also says      Atlanta's suburban sprawl is fast encroaching on their      area, so they feel a sense of urgency.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Campbell says, "My idea is that we need to link land      conservation with ritual and with people in a very      fundamental way. When the economy is not quite what it      should be, money is a problem (for groups dedicated to land      preservation), but if Mamma and Grandmamma are buried some      place, you might look at it differently."    </p>    <p>      Establishing the preserve seemed simple, but it proved a      daunting task, according to Kimberley Campbell. In 1992,      the state cemetery board was legislatively disbanded; as a      consequence, determining which authorities to contact about      the project proved a challenge.    </p>    <p>      To help build the site's status as a nature preserve, an      inventory of plants has been taken, and Dr. Campbell says a      "site appropriate" native plant-the smooth-leafed      coneflower (Echinacea laevigata) - is being planted      on some of the grave sites to take advantage of the      disturbed soil. Tripartite violets and the crested coral      root, uncommon native plants, also have been found.    </p>    <p>      A visitor's center, staffed by Kimberley's parents, sits      near the entrance, and an old chapel has been moved onto      the grounds to be restored for use by people of all faiths.      Life histories of those buried at the site will be archived      there.    </p>    <p>      The Campbells also have provided assistance to others      interested in following their example. Dr. Campbell says he      is willing to work with any entity with large land holdings      that might want to set up a similar preserve-complete      with ethical oversights in both financial and environmental      areas. "We're building a socially responsible for-profit      business," he says of Memorial Ecosystems.    </p>    <p>      Of the other green burial initiatives under way in the      United States, the closest to being operational is the      Glendale Memorial Nature Preserve near Glendale, Florida.      It is owned by brothers John and Bill Wilkerson, and now      can accept burials but not yet legally charge for them.      John, the family's spokesperson, says that's because he and      his brother still are negotiating with the state of Florida      over a $5,000 nonrefundable cemetery application fee, plus      a $50,000 trust fund required to ensure maintenance of the      nature preserve but which duplicates a fund to be      established under Memorial Ecosystems guidelines. Until an      agreement is reached, in lieu of a formal burial fee,      donations were being accepted; as of early 2003, no burials      had taken place.    </p>    <p>      The Glendale preserve was established, John says, because      he and his brother took their father seriously when he      said, "Boys, this is a beautiful piece of property. It      would be a shame to turn it into a mobile-home park." The      entire 350-acre farm, where the elder Wilkerson grew      peanuts, corn and soybeans, and his sons now grow chufa, a      specialty wildlife seed crop, will be the preserve.    </p>    <p>      In addition to providing grave sites, the Wikersons make      simple coffins from native woods, using an on-farm sawmill,      and have gathered a selection of flat indigenous stones,      which a local stonemason has agreed to engrave.    </p>    <p>      John says he and Bill handled their own parents' burials,      including making the coffins-pine for Dad; poplar for      Mom-and digging the graves. Their father died in 1996      and their mother, who wanted her funeral and burial to be a      simple affair, "and never missed a chance to remind us of      that," died in 2000. The couple is buried in a little      church cemetery that lies adjacent to the farm, on land      they donated earlier to the church. Digging those graves      was "a very powerful thing to do," John says. "It really      facilitated the grieving process."    </p>    <p>      Dr. Campbell, who is on the Glendale Preserve's board of      directors but not involved financially in the project, has      attended meetings between the Wilkersons and Florida state      officials to help explain the memorial preserve idea. He      says he thinks Florida's financial requirements are      "oppressive" and notes an Ohio group also trying to      establish a memorial preserve is dealing with a similar      situation. Such fees are designed to help ensure perpetual      care" lot grave site', in a new cemetery. .says Carlson,      but in a green cemetery, traditional maintenance practices,      like large-.5c-.ilu lawn mowing, do not occur.    </p>    <p>      The rules at both Ramsey Creek and Glendale Preserves are      simple: No embalming no casket unless it is biodegradable,      no vault and no stone that that can be pushed over.      Kimberley Campbell says they advocate natural burial as the      best choice and cremation as the second best because      cremation uses energy and re leases toxins into the      environment. Natural burial really isn't a new idea, she      adds. "It's thousands of years old, and the reason is, its      a very natural effective way to dispose of a person's      remains. And wouldn't it be wonderful to visit a loved      one's grave a site atom, a beautiful prune trail, in a      towering England forest or other quiet place of natural      beauty?    </p>        <h3>      HOME FUNERALS    </h3>    <p>      Your mother is dying. You want to care for her yourself, at      home, when death finally arrives, rather than hiring a      mortuary. She feels the same. Together, while there is      still time, you decide to plan her service and burial. How      do you begin?    </p>    <p>      Three books are especially helpful: Caring for the      <em>Dead: Your</em> Final Act <em>of</em> Love, by Lisa      Carlson; <em>Guidebook for Creating</em> Home <em>Funerals      by</em> Jerri Lyons; and <em>Dealing Creatively</em> with      <em>Death, A Manual of Death Education</em> and Simple      Burial by Ernest Morgan.    </p>    <p>      Carlson, executive director of the nonprofit Funeral      Consumers Alliance in South Burlington, Vermont, has become      a national spokesperson for the "do-it-yourself" funeral      movement in the last few years. She says such burials,      especially on private land, appear to be on the rise.      "There's no easy way to track it, but there seems to be an      ongoing interest in family burial. It's being done quietly,      but the number of inquiries on this topic at the Funeral      Consumers Alliance is definitely increasing."    </p>    <p>      The trend is totally predictable, she adds. "The generation      that demanded natural childbirth in the '60s and '70s, and      recycling in the '90s is wanting green burials, including      do-it-yourselfers, now."    </p>    <p>      Author Jerri Lyons is director of Final Passages, a      7-year-old not-for-profit organization in Sebastopol,      California, and a death midwife. Her goal with Final      Passages is "to reintroduce the concept of funerals in the      home as a part of family life and as a way to      deinstitutionalize death." Through this nonprofit project,      she provides information and education, and through her own      for-profit company, Home and Family Funerals, she offers      her death midwife services. She knows of several other      death midwives in California and one in Maryland: others      may be working quietly on their own in other areas.    </p>        <p>      Lyons personally has helped more than 200 California      families handle their own funerals, and she has counseled      many more across the country via the telephone. She says      she believes the widespread practice of having the deceased      person's body whisked away at the time of death by funeral      home personnel interrupts the normal grieving process and      destroys the coherence families can achieve on their own.      When the family handles is own funerals, members gain      "better closure, a sense of empowerment and substantial      economic savings."    </p>    <p>      Lyons' guidebook includes step-by-step instructions for      such things as washing and dressing the body to "lie in      honor," and handling transportation of the body home and/or      to the place of disposition, which is either cremation or      burial. The book also includes specific information on      government paperwork required for home funerals in      California.    </p>    <p>      Through Final Passages, Lyons presents workshops about      funeral options and about becoming death guides or death      midwives like herself.    </p>    <p>      Most of the families Lyons has helped used cremation for      disposition of the body. She also has participated in one      "earth friendly" or green burial, in the Sebastopol      Memorial Lawn Cemetery, an older, privately owned facility.      The body was not embalmed; the casket was pine and no vault      was used; the dirt was simply mounded up on the grave,      rather than being leveled as it is over a vault.    </p>    <p>      Lyons predicts green and home burials will increase if      information about them becomes more widely available. "Most      people in this country don't know they have the legal right      to care for their own loved ones when they die," she says.    </p>        <p>      The organization's Web site includes interviews with people      who have planned their own funerals and photographs of      burials, along with resource information. Death midwife      Jerri Lyons sits with Jasmine during her threeday wake,      which was held in a friend's home overlooking the Pacific      Ocean.    </p>    <p>      Carlson cautions persons who choose to handle death      privately to "take great care to follow all state and local      regulations. The requirements are not complex, but failure      to meet them can lead to unpleasant situations and create a      climate in which professionals become less willing to work      with families."    </p>    <p>      In her book, she explains the precision needed in filling      out a death certificate, required by every state, and she      reports situations where special death certificates are      required, including fetal deaths and those that require an      autopsy. She notes that special circumstances, such as an      extended time between death and disposition, may make      embalming necessary, but refrigeration or dry ice can take      the place of embalming in many instances. She also warns      readers to "never move a body without a permit or medical      permission."    </p>    <p>      Home burials require an examination of local zoning      ordinances, says Carlson. "For those with land in rural or      semi-rural areas, home burials usually are possible."    </p>        <h3>      REMEMBER    </h3>    <p>      Even if you use a conventional funeral home and cemetery,      be aware that embalming, expensive caskets and concrete      vaults generally are not required by law. Cemeteries may      set such requirements, and waive them if they choose. So,      if you want a simpler burial, ask around. You may find a      funeral home and cemetery that suits your needs.    </p>    <p>      If you are thinking about handling a funeral yourself, you      should know that most states clearly allow families to care      for their own dead, according to Lisa Carlson, author of      Caring for the <em>Dead:</em> <em>Your</em> Final Act      <em>of Love.</em> Only six states may limit families who      want to take charge of the process: Connecticut, Indiana,      Louisiana, Michigan (thanks to an uncooperative health      department despite a law that says otherwise), Nebraska and      New York. For more details, read Caring for the <em>Dead,      or</em> contact Carlson at www.funerals.org. If you don't      hire a funeral director, here are some things you should      know:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Death Certificates.</strong> A death certificate      stating the cause of death and signed by a doctor must be      filed, usually in the county or district where death      occurs, where a body is found, or where a body is removed      from a public conveyance or vehicle. This must usually be      accomplished before other permits are granted or before      final disposition.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Embalming.</strong> No state requires routine      embalming of all bodies. Refrigeration or dry ice can      substitute for embalming in most instances. Special      circumstances such as extended time between death and      disposition can necessitate embalming under state law.      Interstate transportation by a common carrier also may      require it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Burial permits.</strong> In some states, when      burial will be outside the county or town where death      occurred, you will need an additional permit to inter from      the local registrar in that area. In many states, the top      of the coffin must be at least 3 feet below the soil      surface. A burial location should be 150 feet or more from      a water supply and outside the utility or power line      easements.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Moving a body.</strong> Never move a body without      having a permit or medical permission in hand!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cremation.</strong> A special permit-to-cremate may      be needed; these are available from the local coroner or      medical examiner, and a modest fee is usually charged.    </p>    <hr />        <h3>      Join the Experts Online    </h3>    <p>      Learn more about green burials and home funerals, and chat      with guest experts Dr. Billy and Kimberley Campbell, Lisa Carlson, John Wilkerson, Mary Woodsen and      Jerri Lyons on the <em><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></em> Web site at      <em>www.motherearthnews.com/forums/</em>    </p>    <h3>      EACH YEAR IN THE U.S. we bury:    </h3>    <p>      827,060 gallons of embalming fluid, which includes      formaldehyde 180,544,000 pounds of steel, in caskets      5,400,000 pounds of copper and bronze, in caskets 30      million board feet of hardwoods, including tropical woods,      in caskets 3,272,000,000 pounds of reinforced concrete in      vaults 28,000,000 pounds of steel in vaults    </p>    <p>      <em>Statistics compiled by Mary Woodsen, vice president of      the Pre-Posthumous Society of Ithaca, New York, and a      science writer at Comell University.</em>    </p>    <hr />    <h3>      For More Information    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Funeral Consumers Alliance.</strong><br />      Lisa Carlson; 33 Patchen Road;<br />      South Burlington, VT 05403;<br />      (800) 765-0107    </p>    <p>      <strong>Final Passages.</strong> Jerri Lyons; PO.<br />      Box 1721; Sebastopol, CA 95473;<br />      (707) 824-0268    </p>    <p>      <strong>Memorial Ecosystems, Inc. and Ramsey Creek      Preserve.</strong><br />      Dr. Billy and Kimberley Campbell;<br />      113 Retreat St.;<br />      Westminster, SC 29693;<br />      (864) 6477798    </p>    <p>      <strong>Glendale Memorial Nature Preserve.</strong><br />      John and Bill Wilkerson;<br />      297 Railroad Ave.; DeFuniak Springs,<br />      FL 32433; (850) 859-2141; www.glendalenaturepreserve.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>The North American Woodland Burial      Society.</strong><br />      An information exchange:<br />      <em>woodlandburial.html</em> <em>planet.com</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Memorial Society of British      Columbia.<br /></strong> 212-1847 W.
