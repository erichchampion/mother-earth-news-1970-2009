                    <h5 id="byline">      Edited by Carol Mack    </h5>        <h3>      New England/Maritime Canada    </h3>    <p>      Once main the snows have receded and the ground is warming.      Garlic and bunching onions lead the way with early,      shoots-check for any that may be caught under the      mulch. Fall-planted spinach, cilantro, kale, wild arugula      and mâche love the warmth and the spring rain.      Direct-seed additional greens and lettuce, and protect      oriental greens and brassicas from flea beetles with row      corers. Try a crop of fava beans. These big-seeded legumes      thrive in the cold spring soil and will be ready to harvest      and shell in July. For a real Mediterranean treat,      sauté favas with a bit of olive oil and spring onion      and garlic greens. Greenhouse shelves are brimming, but      make room for cucurbit starts (squash, melons and gourds).      In the orchard, remove mouse guards and check for damage.      Finish pruning and top-dress fruit trees, shrubs and      brambles with well-rotted manure or compost.    </p>    <h3>      Mid-Atlantic    </h3>    <p>      Time to transplant-get cut those trowels! We try to      have the best portion of our brassicas in the ground (under      row cover) by tax day, along with a brave few early      tomatoes. Remove old kale. Mustard and turnip plants before      harlequin bugs have a chance to reproduce, and plant      successions of radishes, peas, lettuce. spinach, beets,      carrots and Chinese greens. In late April, start summer      squash, cucumbers and long-season gourds in newspaper pots      (made by wrapping newspaper around a cup, sliding the cup      Out and Finding the newspaper with paper tape). Hill soil      around potatoes when they are ankle high. In May, plant      summer greens. 'Rainbow' Swiss chard and 'Dandy' red orach      produce colorful, long-lasting crops. Transplant      main-season tomatoes. peppers and eggplants four days after      the whippoorwill first sings and finish when oak leaves are      quarter sire. Peppers and tomatoes thrive in hay/straw      mulch-but not eggplants because the mulch encourages      flea beetles.    </p>    <h3>      Southern Interior    </h3>    <p>      Good things are beginning to happen in the garden. Take      advantage of these pretty April days to start working on      your garden spots to get ready for the summer bounty. Maybe      you are having visions of salad-those early tomatoes,      lettuces and radishes are ready for transplanting. After      the last frost has passed, the heat-loving vegetables you      started indoors (cucumbers, tomatoes peppers and squash)      can be moved to their new homes. Use this time to get your      plants established. A steady diet of water will help new      shrubs and trees get those roots going. Sow annual flowers      and vegetables-they will take off as the air begins      to Warm Up. Don't forget to assess the success of your      spring bulb planting. Make notes now, while it's still      fresh in your mind, and keep those notes where you can find      them at bulb-ordering time.    </p>    <h3>      Gulf Coast    </h3>        <p>      Some crops, such as Southern peas aril okra, demand warm      temperatures before they will really take off. Now's the      time to begin planting these. Its not too late to plant      more bush beans, summer squash, melons, peppers, eggplants.      marigolds, zinnias, gomphrena, rudbeckia, coleus and      caladiums. If you've waited this long to plant tomatoes,      consider choosing heat-tolerant cherry tomatoes or      rapid-maturing varieties like `Early Girl.' Check crops      such as green beans and tomatoes for spider mites. They are      especially severe in years when we have a dry spring. If      you catch mites early, keep them in check with a      high-pressure water spray or a low-toxicity spray like      wettable sulfur.    </p>    <p>      This is a critical time to spray fruit and nut trees. Many      Cooperative Extension offices have organic or low-toxicity      spray guides available. Pests like plum curculio and brown      rot are relentless when it comes to stone fruits like plums      and peaches.    </p>    <h3>      Central/Midwest    </h3>    <p>      This is a time of year when temperatures fluctuate widely.      Still freezing? Tackle winter cleanup chores and repair      garden tools. If we are having a cool spring, plant early      crops like broad (fava) beans, peas, lettuce, onions and      greens now. Planting early flowers will bring bees to your      garden to pollinate the first vegetables-try direct      seeding poppies, nigella, larkspur, cosmos and gypsophila.      This is also a good time of year to divide perennial      flowers to benefit their health. There is still plenty of      time to start transplants indoors-they will catch up      quickly as the days lengthen. Generally, there is a frost      near the Victoria Day weekend (late May), so don't get      carried away and plant tender things yet! To avoid carrot      rust-fly problems, wait until June to seed carrots. We do      this every year with success.    </p>    <h3>      North Central and Rockies    </h3>    <p>      Survey your dominion and assess your solar assets. See      where the snow melted first, where green emerged, where      cold spots remain. Garden soil that slopes in a southern      direction generally warms faster. Plant your early-season      crops-arugula, kale, lettuce, pac choi, pea, radish      and spinach-in these areas warmed by the sun and you      will maximize your harvest in the shortest possible time.    </p>    <p>      As you plant, remember each seed is a living embryo. Treat      it with respect. Most small, hard, round seeds will last      for years if kept cool, dark and dry. Germination      percentage for a packet of seeds may fall over the years.      but think twice about throwing away your old stock and      automatically ordering new seeds each year. You simply need      to plant extra old seeds to compensate for lower      germination rates.    </p>    <h3>      Pacific Northwest    </h3>    <p>      Longer days and rising temperatures bring Northwest      gardeners out of hibernation. In early April, jump-start      the season by covering your beds with plastic. This will      allow the soil to dry out and warm up quickly. Once the      soil is dry enough to till, remove the plastic and work the      beds. The brassicas (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale,      etc.) along with salad greens, beets and carrots all can be      planted outside a few weeks prior to the last frost. Wait      until after this date for frost-sensitive plants. Take time      this spring to make gardening a family activity. Plant a      patch of wheat in the front yard to set off a six-month      neighborhood bread-making project, or grow tall sunflowers      to focus on the awesome ability of one seed. There's      everything to do in April and May, but if we want our      children to garden, sometimes we need to remember how to      play in the dirt ourselves.    </p>    <h3>      Southwest    </h3>    <p>      When nights are consistently above 50 degrees, it's time to      plant out seedlings of eggplants, peppers and tomatoes.      Direct-seed crops like beans, chard, collards, corn,      cucumbers, kale, leeks, melons, muskmelons, mustard, okra,      onions, parsley, pumpkins, squash, watermelon, sweet basil      and other herbs.    </p>    <p>      Before you plant, consider how you will water. Some drip      irrigation systems like T-tape are easier to lay out before      you transplant, but the effort pays off because the water      goes to the plant, not the weed. (See "Irrigation Made      Easy," August/ September 2002.) A mulch of wheat straw also      cuts down on weeding and helps conserve water as we recover      from a multiyear drought.    </p>    <p>      Check catalogs for specialty vegetables traditional to      Asian, Central American and South American Cuisines. These      include varieties that thrive in our summer heat and can be      directseeded now, including amaranth, Asian and Portuguese      cabbages, huauzontli (a red-leaved Aztec spinach), jicama      and edamame.    </p>    <p>      Our thanks to the following for their contributions to the      Almanac: Roberta Bailey, FEDCO Seeds, Waterville, Maine;      Cricket Rakita, Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, Mineral,      Virginia; Connie Dam-Byl, William Dam Seeds, Dundas.

Adams,      Burton, Texas.    </p>        <h3>      Yellow Jackets    </h3>    <p>      Most of us view yellow jackets as major pests. However,      some of the species help us by feeding on aphids,      caterpillars and other garden pests, while the rest play a      beneficial role as nature's cleanup squad. We'd probably be      neck-deep in dead meat without their help. Still, it is      hard to be grateful to these critters when they are      commandeering your forkful of grilled chicken or delivering      a painful sting. And unlike honeybees, these      yellow-and-black wasp relatives can sting repeatedly. That      sting, plus their "meat and sweet" diet, can add a certain      element of tension to fruit picking and fine dining in the      out-of-doors.    </p>    <p>      Most people wait until numbers build up before putting out      yellow jacket traps, but trapping in April and May is      actually more effective in many areas. Although yellow      jackets (Vespula species) are social insects like      honeybees, they use their nests for only one season. All      the workers and drones die off in the fall and      responsibility for propagating the species is left to the      newly hatched and fertilized queens. In late fall, the      queens crawl into forest leaf-lit ter or some other      protected site. Insulating leaves, snow and an ability to      "super cool" protect the ladies from sub-zero temperatures      all winter. Come spring, they emerge and start a new nest,      often in a mouse or vole tunnel. Until the first batch of      workers hatches, the queen must forage for all the food      herself, and this two- to three-week period is when she is      vulnerable to being trapped. Every queen killed now may      eliminate several thousand yellow jackets later in the      season. (The pa per wasps that nest under the eaves are not      usually picnic pests, and are great caterpillar hunters, so      unless the nest is near a doorway, it's best to leave them      be.)    </p>    <p>      Weather during this spring period also may be a crucial      factor in whether a particular season proves to be a "bad"      yellow jacket year. A severe cold snap just after the      protective layer of snow has melted could kill off many      queens still in the ground, thereby reducing the number of      prospective nests. A prolonged wet spell could hamper the      queen's ability to set up a nest or forage, resulting in      fewer bees per nest. On the other hand, a consistently dry,      warm spring allows huge numbers of dormant queens to wake      up comfortably and successfully go about their business.    </p>    <p>      Other natural factors also may be at work locally-one      summer night we had a black bear carefully search and      destroy at least eight nests in our one-acre orchard.      Nothing was left the next morning but holes in the ground      and a few forlorn bees. However, failing bears in the      neighborhood, spring trapping may be a more dependable      method of control.    </p>    <p>      Both homemade and commercial yellow jacket traps (available      at most garden stores) can be effective. One expert      suggests bologna and apple juice to attract the bees, and      others swear by tuna-flavored cat food. Some commercial      "attractants" claim to lure in the queens particularly      well. The best bet is to experiment for several seasons to      see what works most effectively in your particular area.      Whatever you use, empty the traps and refresh the bait      every few days. Yellow jackets dislike the smell of rotting      meat, including rotting dead yellow jackets. Place the      traps out of direct sunlight in an open area and away from      where you plan to be active. Random insecticide spraying      will do nothing to control numbers. However, a direct shot      can kill a nest of yellow jackets, if necessary. Work very      carefully at night when the yellow jackets are      home-and have an escape route planned!    </p>
