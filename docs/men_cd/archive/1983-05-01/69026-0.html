        Several antique apple varieties?such as, but not necessarily including, the Esopus Spitzenbergs (RIGHT) and the Golden Russets (LEFT)-are often available through Lyons, New York's Mayo Nursery. You'll also find sources of scionwood (for grafting) ... lowacid blackberry plants ... special low-chill apple varieties (that can survive in especially warm regions) ... a cold-tolerant (to 60' below!) kiwi fruit ... and even a low- tannin eating-variety acorn ... all in this issue's The Seasons of the Garden column.
