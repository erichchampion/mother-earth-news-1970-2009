            		<p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>				<p><strong>        Make delicious jelly & wine from "weeds."      </strong>		</p>        <p>      Here's a tip for practical weed control. Use your      dandelions to make jelly and wine; I'm enclosing recipes      for both. The jelly has won blue ribbons at our local fair.    </p>    <h3>Dandelion Jelly</h3>    <p>1 quart dasndelion flowers, well packed (remove all stem    and calyx) 1 quart water 1 1 3/4 -ounce package pectin (MCP)    2 tablespoons lemon juice 4 1/2 cups sugar 3-4 drops yellow    food coloring (optional)<br />    Boil flowers in water for 3 minutes; strain through muslin    for 3 cups juice. Add pectin and lemon juice, and stir all    until pectin is completely dissolved (a few minutes). Bring    to a rolling boil; add sugar and food coloring. Bring back to    fast, furious, climb-up-the-side-of-the-pot boil, and    maintain for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, quickly skim, and    pour into waiting jars. Seal according to standard canning    procedures. Makes about 4 half-pint jars.</p>    <h3>Dandelion Wine</h3>    <p>1 gallon dandelion flowers (minus stems and calyx) 1    gallon boiling water 3 pounds white sugar 3 oranges, cut in    small pieces 3 lemons, cut in small pieces 1 ounce cake yeast    stone crock or huge glass container, scalded Put flowers in    crock, pour boiling water over them, and let stand for three    days, stirring a couple of times a day. Strain juice through    muslin. Re-scald crock. Pour juice and rest of ingredients    back into crock. Let stand for three weeks, covered, to    ferment; stir once a day. Strain through muslin again, then    bottle. Either cork bottles, dipping corked tops in melted    wax to seal, or use a bottle capper. Makes about 12 12-ounce    bottles per batch, and the recipe can be doubled and doubled    again, depending on the strength of your back for dandelion    picking.</p>    <p>      I'm also a big canner, and I have some helpful hints for      your readers who also enjoy canning:    </p>    <p>      1. When making apple butter, cook the pulp down in a heavy      pan in a 325°350°F oven, stirring occasionally.      (This means no constant stirring for hours on a stove      burner, no scorching, no heavy-duty pot scrubbing      afterward.)    </p>    <p>      2. Avoid mayonnaise jars and the like they're too flimsy.      If one cracks (and they do, all too often), you've lost      time, labor, and product. Look for real canning jars at      garage sales and thrift stores-check rims for nicks and      surfaces for hairline cracks before purchasing.    </p>    <p>      3. Ever have the liquid boil out of a jar of food during      the water-bath process? The newest recommendation from my      nearby County Extension Office is to first put jars on      racks and lower into warm water in the water-bath. Then      bring the temperature to 190°F, and water-bath for the      recommended time.    </p>    <p>      Our County Extension Office offers classes by certified      master food preservers for people who want to put up their      own produce (canning, freezing, curing, etc.). The classes      are inexpensive, take a couple of hours, and teach you to      "put up" preserved foods safely! No matter how much you've      canned, a quick brush-up class is in valuable. Check the      County Extension Office in your area.    </p>    <p>      -Vivian Herron<br />      Washington, CA    </p>    <h3>Trashy Tomatoes</h3>        <p>      I am enclosing some photographs of my tomato effort last      year. I thought you might be interested.    </p>    <p>      I live in Texas near my retired parents, and usually bust      up the garden and plant our tomatoes in the ground like      always, then stake them as they grow. This year I decided      to try something different. Tired of fighting the nut grass      and other weeds, I came up with the idea of using trash      bags as containers. The idea behind it all was to virtually      eliminate the work involved.    </p>    <p>      I filled each bag with leaves (whole) and found a nice      sunny spot up against the house. Before putting the bags on      the ground, I loosened the ground at the spots where the      bags would be placed. Then, I split the undersides of the      bags in an X pattern and set them in their spots.    </p>    <p>      I used duct tape to make a square on the top of each bag. I      cut a slit in the center of the square to allow hand-entry      into the leaves. Next, I used permeable nursery sacks (used      to cover early plants for protection), filling each one      with a 3-to1 concoction of sheep manure and organic humus.      Then I placed the sacks inside the bags of leaves, and      planted a tomato sprout in each one.    </p>    <p>      Nearby, in a trash can, I filled a large plastic trash bag      with water, about one-third of a sack of sheep manure, and      a little humus. I stirred it up and put a lid on it. This      causes a cooking process during the day in the sun, and it      ferments. I used this "soup" on the tomatoes daily. I did      very well with this idea (you can see the results for      yourself), and I intend to expand on it this year. I picked      tomatoes into November, and best of all-there's no work!    </p>    <p>      -Terry Lancaster<br />      Teague, TX    </p>    <h3>Virtue Is Its Own Reward</h3>    <p>      Ever since California was in a drought condition a few      years ago, it has been my wife's habit to keep a plastic      bucket of water near our sink. It's purpose was to accept      all rinse water after the dishes were done, to use for the      flower boxes that decorate the west side of our house.    </p>    <p>      Much to our surprise, when the early spring came, volunteer      tomatoes sprang up in those flower boxes, and are as      delicious and plentiful as their forebears from our regular      garden. The hot western sun is just what these tomatoes      ordered. Who says that you can't grow a full plant in just      4 inches of soil? Right now we're waiting for the      watermelons to sprout.    </p>    <p>      -John Higginsons<br />      Long Beach, CA    </p>    <h3>Garden Reflections</h3>    <p>      Out here in our semi-rural area, an annual late fall task      is to line the driveway with reflectors, those shiny      plastic circles atop long metal stakes. Since the snowplow      routinely destroys a few every winter, every fall requires      an outlay of cash for replacements. To squeeze every bit of      use out of these reflectors, they don't just gather dust in      the garage once spring comes they go right into the garden!    </p>    <p>      Driveway reflectors can be used anywhere you'd use stakes,      such as for row markers. Reflectors are also great supports      for vertically grown vining plants, like pole beans. Use      them singly or lashed together into a tepee.    </p>    <p>      And the year our garden was overrun by sprawling cantaloupe      plants, reflectors increased the efficiency of      hand-watering. How? By planting a reflector at the same      time you plant the seed of a soon-to-be sprawling plant,      you'll easily locate the plant's base for watering once      it's covered in a sea of green leaves and fruit.    </p>    <p>      And for very young gardeners, reflectors are an easy visual      aid for defining whatever boundaries the parent wants the      child to see. Last summer, our 3-year-olds mini plot within      the family garden had reflectors at its corners. The      reflectors are so tall (compared to a preschooler) that our      son found his garden by himself every time. It made      gardening easier and more independent for him, and meant      fewer interruptions for the rest of us. So this year, don't      put those driveway reflectors away just because the snow's      melted.    </p>    <p>      -Janet Cass<br />      North Oaks, MN    </p>    <h3>Foiling Fowl</h3>    <p>      Help! My hens and rooster are destroying my raised flower      beds. They scratch and dig for bugs, then have the nerve to      lay on the dirt to sun themselves. Is there anything I can      put in my gardens to stop my foraging fowl without damaging      my plants? Any reader suggestions would be very      appreciated!    </p>    <p>      -Wendy L. Moore<br />      Carmel, ME    </p>    <h3>Natural Bleach</h3>    <p>      To bleach old, yellowed newspaper clippings, dissolve one      tablet or 2 tablespoons of liquid milk of magnesia in I      quart of club soda; mix well. (If using the tablet, be sure      it dissolves completely.) Chill the solution for eight      hours in the refrigerator. Next, pour the solution in a      shallow pan. Place the newspaper clipping in the pan, and      let it soak for an hour. Remove clipping; place between      paper towels or other absorbent material, being careful not      to tear it. Pat the clipping as dry as possible. Place on a      flat surface to dry completely. You can soak several      clippings at a time, but be sure they don't overlap in the      shallow pan. If tightly capped, the solution can be saved      and stored for one week. Repeat in SO years!    </p>    <p>      -Karen Ann Bland<br />      Gove, KS    </p>    <p>      Send your tips to "Country Lore," <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, P.O.
