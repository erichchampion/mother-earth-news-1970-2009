                    <h2 id="subtitle">      MAXIMUM SUN    </h2>    <p>      A manual solar tracker-cheap, rugged . . . perfect.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Tom Moates    </h5>        <p>      The first winter on our homestead was rough. The snows were      the worst anyone could remember in these Blue Ridge      Mountains of Virginia, and aside from the house being      completely incomplete and without running water, the solar      panels-our source of electricity-were , sitting      on the ground, leaned up against a camper shell to do their      collecting. When spring finally sprang permanently,      mounting our photovoltaic array was a priority we could no      longer put off, even though our funds were seriously      depleted. No longer could we afford weeds climbing in front      of the modules, tree shadows, and dog traffic-all      debilitating our current generation as water pumping and      clothes washing became a regular in-homestead event.    </p>            <p>      The treetops around the homestead remained bright with      sunlight for awhile after the sun dropped behind the higher      surrounding ridge for the evening, so it was obvious a tall      mounting pole would help harness more power each day. Also,      we explored the benefits of panel mounts that track the      sun. The pros say that in the winter, a tracking array in      an unobstructed spot produces at least 15 percent more      power than a stationary model; in summer, that figure jumps      from 40 to 60 percent. This is a substantial gain, but we      simply couldn't afford a self-tracking mount-which      would have been more than $1,000 for one large enough to      house all our panels.    </p>    <p>      Carol, my wife, brought to my attention the key to solving      the dilemma. "With the animals and gardens," she said,      "someone is usually here-couldn't we turn them?"    </p>        <p>      Of course! A manual tracker-cheap, rugged.. .perfect.      For pennies compared to the factory built self-tracker, I      designed and built a manual tracker large enough to handle      our current 18 panels as well as 12 additional panels we      hope to add one day, and used material we already had on      hand.    </p>    <p>      The design is simple. The sun makes its journey across the      sky in an orbital path, so the solar array needs to track      in that same way. Also, the sun tracks much higher in the      sky during the long days of summer (figure the angle by      subtracting 15 degrees from your latitude) than in the      shorter winter days (latitude plus 15 degrees). To maximize      full frontal angle to the sun, the array also needed to      tilt up and down to allow for this seasonal change.    </p>    <p>      Adjust the size of the tracker in this article to fit your      needs. The total area of our panels is about 60 square      feet, but an upgrade to 120 square feet was allowed for, so      the overall size of the tracker is 10' x 12' though it      isn't all used yet.    </p>    <p>      The basic skeleton of the apparatus is six long pieces of      angle iron drilled and bolted together. A pivot cap is      needed for the top of the pole where the whole thing hinges      for the up and down winter/summer adjustment. Three small      angle pivots are needed for the daily orbital swinging of      the array. Four rough oak 1 x 4's act similar to roof      purlins and allow for the mounting of the panels      themselves. Finally, a hand winch is attached to the base      of the pole, and cables are run to allow the whole thing to      turn on its hinge points when the winch is cranked and the      top of the pole is guyed off to the ground for stability in      wind.    </p>    <h3>      Materials    </h3>    <p>      A straight 30-foot-long locust pole from a tree felled      while clearing for the garden was our choice to hold the      array. Choose a pole length that optimizes your sunlight      potential-either a wooden or metal pole will suffice.    </p>    <p>      A few bags of concrete are needed to set the pole in the      ground; you need enough to fill two-thirds of the hole      around the pole with concrete.    </p>    <p>      Aside from the photovoltaic panels themselves, the most      expensive part of the array is likely to be the angle iron.      Most areas have scrap yards, and it's hard to say how much      you might have to pay for the pieces. Purchased brand new,      the galvanized angle iron for this project would cost about      $100, but there are bound to be sources for scrap in the      immediate vicinity.    </p>    <p>      Lag bolts, bolts, cable, and even the winch (refer to      materials list on page 88 for numbers of each) should be      available from most building or farm supplies. A catalog      company called Northern Hydraulics (2800 S. Cross Dr. West,      Burnsville, MN 55306, 800-222-5381) also has such supplies      at a reasonable cost.    </p>    <h3>      Construction    </h3>    <p>      Much of the initial work involved in this project is      drilling bolt holes through the angle iron pieces. A drill      press and sharp bit helps speed up this task, but it can be      done with an electric hand drill. For each hole, take your      measurements, make a small indentation with a center punch      at the center point of the hole for the bit to follow, and      always apply light cutting oil to the bit and metal while      drilling (refer to the diagram depicting each piece with      size and positions of holes for layout). It helps to label      each piece of angle you have acquired with its respective      diagram number for reference during layout and assembly.      Also, a metal cutting bandsaw, a metal chopsaw, a cutting      torch, or even a grinder can be used to cut the angle iron.    </p>    <p>      The top pole pivot and the three identical frame pivots      require a bit of welding. Make sure all welds are done by      an experienced welder-a faulty weld could snap in a      wind with devastating results. The top pivot is a piece of      1/4" plate metal (4) cut slightly larger than the top of      your mounting pole, with four 12" legs (4c-4f) welded      across from one another that fit over the top of the pole.      Lag bolts screw through the holes into the pole to hold the      unit-and pieces 4a and 4b are welded back to back on      the other side of 4c. The 2 1/2" with the clips cut out and      bolt holes aligned together stick out beyond the edge of 4c      to allow for the hinging action of the entire array.    </p>    <p>      The frame pivots (5a, b, and c) are two short pieces of      angle with some edges trimmed, bolt holes drilled, and      welded into a "T". The diagrams for the pieces show how      they should look when finished.    </p>    <h3>      Assembly    </h3>        <p>      For simplicity, we fitted and mounted the top pole pivot      onto the pole before raising it. This allowed for an easy      work space but the overhang of parts 4a and 4b must be      oriented southward when the pole is permanently      set-which was difficult to maintain while setting the      pole.    </p>    <p>      With post hole diggers we dug a 6' hole and then, using a      gin pole, we hoisted the massive locust post into the air      and sank it into the hole. When setting your pole, use a 4'      level to maintain plumb while filling in around the base      with concrete. Then tamp rocks and dirt into the hole,      keeping true while filling it the rest of the way.    </p>    <p>      Once the pole is up, erect scaffolding along side of it to      provide a safe work space for the higher-altitude assembly.    </p>    <p>      The first piece to go up is the spine. It can be      preassembled on the ground; set 2a and 2b back to back and      bolt frame pivots 5a, 5b, and 5c in their positions on the      flat side of the spine. Use lock washers on the bolts and      tighten snugly. Notice that when the frame pivots are      installed, spine pieces 2a and 2b, though oriented back to      back, do not touch. This opening allows for the top pole      pivot (piece 4) to fit between 2a and 2b with a single bolt      passing through all four pieces (4a, 4b, 2a, and 2b),      creating the main hinge that holds the entire array. Pull      the assembled spine up the scaffolding, and bolt it in      place to the top pole pivot, making sure that the bolt hole      on the spine for the angle brace is facing the downward      side.    </p>    <p>      Bolt the brace (piece 3) to its hole in the spine, and then      lag bolt it back to the pole in a position that allows for      easiest access for installation of the remaining pieces      from your scaffolding. Notice the brace has multiple holes      on the end towards the pole; this allows for the adjustment      of the array for higher summer sun tracking or lower winter      sun tracking.    </p>    <p>      Next carry up and bolt the frame pieces in place (1a, 1b,      and 1c). Take care to mount 1b to the center frame pivot      (5b); this frame piece has holes drilled at either end for      attaching the turning cables. Snug these bolts down, but      not so excruciatingly tight that they won't allow the frame      to pivot. Adding a bit of grease between the frame and      pivot will help the process as well.    </p>    <p>      Using 3/8" carriage bolts with lock washers, bolt the 1 x 4      oak purlins onto the frame. It may be easiest to C-clamp      the boards to the frame pieces in place, and then drill by      running the bit through the holes already in the angle      pieces, and bolt them from the scaffolding. Note that you      may wish to configure the purlins slightly differently than      we have to accommodate other kinds of panels. The important      things to keep in mind are that the array should be equally      balanced in weight on either side, and that the weather      tight electrical boxes on the back sides of the panels      should be kept to the side of the purlins for      accessibility. You also may want to treat the purlins with      a wood preservative before sending them up.    </p>    <p>      Using wood is nice because it allows for a certain amount      of flexibility in the rig. Different types of panels are      easily mounted. Some of our panels, for instance, have      aluminum frames with predrilled holes, which we attached      simply by drilling through the oak and fastened with      carriage bolts. The other panels only have small plastic      frames that were mounted with screws and neoprene washers,      pinching the edges of these frames in several spots.    </p>    <p>      With the wood in place, mount and wire your panels. Next,      attach an end of a piece of 1/8" cable to a hole at an end      of 1b using a cable eye and two clamps. Mount your hand      winch to a comfortable spot at the base of the pole. With      the array turned fully to the side where the cable      connection is up in the air, cut the cable at the winch and      connect it properly to the winch spool.    </p>    <p>      Now connect another cable to the hole in the other end of      lb in the same fashion as above, and crank the winch      turning the array fully to the other direction. Place a lag      bolt into the pole above the winch at about shoulder      height, cut the cable dangling from the side of lb now high      in the air, and put a loop in the end so that it may slip      over the lag bolt. When the array is fully turned with the      winch, the cable loop in the lag bolt will keep the array      snug so that even strong winds won't swing it around.    </p>    <p>      Place lag bolts at several other positions down the pole so      that the loop on the loose cable may be changed from one to      another, effectively locking the winch on these positions      throughout the day. Be careful not to overtighten the rig      with the winch-just a little tension works fine.    </p>    <p>      Back at the top of the pole, attach at least three guy      wires to the top pole pivot with two clamps each. Run these      to stabs driven deeply into the ground (at least three      feet), and put turn buckles into the guy wires near the      ground so they may be tightened occasionally.    </p>    <p>      Finally you must protect the rig against lightning strikes.      Drive your 8' copper or galvanized ground rod into the      ground at the base of the pole. Bolt a large copper wire (I      used 3/0 copper and I wouldn't suggest less than 1/0      copper) to the spine (2a), and run this down and attach the      other end to the ground rod. This is a separate ground from      your system ground and should take direct hits right into      the ground away from the system. We also have a system      ground connected to the negative side at the battery, have      fused disconnects coming from the panels on the positive      leg, and have a low voltage lightning arrester before the      fuse. This is an adequate ground. Some installations run      multiple ground rods from the array frame in every      direction, but this strikes me (sorry) as a bit of      overkill. The rod's ultimate purpose is to discharge an      <em>occasional</em> and unwanted direct hit, not to provide      the ultimate encouragement and opportunity for every      passing thunderhead by saying, "Hey, look at this great      discharge spot over here!"    </p>    <p>      If you're going to be away for the day, just leave the      array pointed south to maximize the stationary collection      of the sun. If you are expecting high winds, take time and      inspect the guy wires for tightness, and snug the array,      making it as parallel to wind currents as you can manage,      thus reducing stress on the panels.    </p>    <p>      The project took several days to fabricate and assemble,      but for a minimal cost we have maximized our photovoltaic      collection and built a tracker that has operated flawlessly      for more than six months and survived several gusty wind      storms without incident-testimony that cheap and      simple technology still can be the most appropriate      alternative for my good old average homestead, and maybe      yours, too.    </p>
