           		<p>			<strong>GARDEN &      YARD</strong>    </p>		        <p>      <strong><strong>Identify and precision-plant the      microclimates of your land.</strong></strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By John Vivian    </h5>    <p>      Illustrations: Bella Hollingworth		</p>		    <p>      I was driving through some of upper Michigan's bleak      sand-dune and peat-bog country a few years back, and      marveled that even scrub pine and horsetails could grow in      such sour and leached-out soil. On a rounding curve, I was      astounded to see a 25- or 30-foot-high festoon of lush      green and heavenly blue reaching for the sky. The angled      guywire of a telephone pole at the entrance to a long farm      drive hosted the most luxuriant growth of Heavenly Blue      Morning Glories (Ipomea C. ) I'd ever seen.    </p>    <p>      I pulled over to examine the base of the flowering vines. A      roadside ditch flowing with dear, tan peat-stained bog      water maintained high local humidity and watered a      waist-high growth of weeds that crowded all around the      pole-except where the morning glories were growing. Three      different-aged plantings of a half dozen vines apiece      emerged from a foot-deep mulch that had been laid over a      trio of well-used wood-slat, bushel-sized produce baskets      half-buried in the sandy peat soil. The basket rim was      solid enough to keep sod and creeping ground vines from      crowding out the Ipomea roots, and each formed a good      6-inch-high, disc-shaped raised bed.    </p>    <p>      Time was too short to arrange a polite visit to see if the      farmer's method was as innovative as the roadside      flower-growing. But, once home I read up on Ipomea, and      learned that it is a woody-stemmed perennial vine that will      grow forever as it climbs lianas and thin tree branches in      its hot, wet tropical homeland. It is also extremely frost      tender, so it is cultivated as a half-hardy annual in      temperate climates. It wants moderate but even moisture and      a soil rich in potassium, phosphorus and trace elements,      but low in nitrogen in the early vegetative growth stage      lest the vine grow too lush at the expense of flowers.      Periodic, later doses of nitrogen are desirable.    </p>    <p>      I theorized that the Michigan farm folks had gone a long      way toward figuring out the plant's ideal (native) growing      conditions. Most important, I guessed, was an unusually      high support so the vine was free to rise more than 30 feet      around the kind of small diameter vertical support its      tight-spiraling stems prefer.    </p>    <p>      These folks also discovered that the vines do best in open,      moving air (to avoid leaf mildew), amid a naturally      selected growth of wild native plants-a natural mix of what      we call weeds that makes it harder for insect pests to      locate their prey species among the conflicting sights,      sounds and smells.    </p>    <h3>Gardening for the New      Century</h3>    <p>      Over the years I've tried to grow supertall morning      glories, and slowly learned the hard way-the wisdom of the      Michigan morning glory method. It embodies a new (to me)      gardening system. Till someone comes up with a better name,      I'll call it "niche gardening"-creating a series of small      garden plots all around your place in spots that offer the      varying combinations of sun/shade, natural or created soil      type, moisture, air flow, soil warmth, and surrounding      vegetation that best duplicates each plant's native      "ecological niche" (see Webster's definition of "niche;"      left).    </p>		    <p>      Niche-gardening applies as well-or better-to food-producing      varieties as it does to flowers, and I'd like to think of      it as the next step toward achieving a 21st century,      nature-knows-best-style home garden. After all, most of us      have already taken the first step and embraced the organic      method of raising food plants by composting kitchen, lawn,      and garden residues to enhance and nourish our soil, and by      opting for benign soil enhancers and natural pest controls      over harsh, manufactured chemicals.    </p>    <p>      But the planning, location, and layout of most vegetable      gardens still reflects the 16th century notion that mankind      has the right and duty to employ science and reason to      impose order on the "chaos" of nature. We've kidnapped      plant species from different natural environments all      around the globe, ranging from potatoes that evolved in the      thin, rocky mineral soils of the cool, dry Peruvian Andes,      to eggplant from the steamy living-sponge soils of      southeast Asian jungles-lined up in unnatural straight      rows, inside a rectangular plot of bare ground, surrounded      by alien plant species, and located in foreign soil      everywhere from Vancouver to Key West.    </p>    <p>      How much better production, better nutrition, and plant      health can we expect by creating specialized nichesmicro      climates-perfectly suited to each plant species?    </p>    <h3>Niche Locations</h3>    <p>      Use your imagination. I've niche-planted anything from a      single tomato in an old wooden bucket, and hung it off the      porch, to a 3-foot row of dense-planted sugar peas on a      trellis in the half-shade of a big maple; to two parallel,      6-foot rows of pickling cucumbers on stakes and netting at      the back of a rose garden; to a 10 x 20-foot plot of      perennial Jerusalem Artichoke bordering the piney woods.      I've located others in the middle of a lawn and the edge of      a weed patch; in half-round or square-sided terraces made      from stones, logs, or landscaping timbers dug into rocky      inclines; in pots in full sun or full shade; in baskets      hanging from the barn eaves; in wood cribs suspended in the      half-shade of the apple tree; on twine strung up at the sun      end of the grape arbor; or from rope strung between trees.    </p>		    <p>      Containers fit well in a niche garden. Half-whiskey      barrels, redwood planters, horse troughs, split propane      tanks and flower boxes can be bottom-drilled and lined with      crushed rock for good drainage, then planted to      strawberries and vegetables. Nantes-type carrots      interplanted with green bunching onions do especially well      for me in 18-inch-deep boxes or raised-bed niches. Oh, that      tomato I tried in an old wooden well bucket-it produced two      fruit sets through July, but developed so much root mass      that it broke the bucket. I set it into twice the soil; it      began flowering and set new fruit well into September.      Moral: A standard tomato plant needs more than a gallon of      soil to produce its maximum.    </p>    <h3>Soil</h3>    <p>      Just enough enriched growing medium to support each plant      is mixed to one's best estimate of the variety's precise      specifications, then placed into quart- to bushel sized      planting holes, or placed in raised beds, pots, tubs, or      terraces. Time-consuming perhaps, but you can do the work      in the off season or bad weather, and save the time wasted      in working the 50 percent or more of garden space that's      typically used for garden paths or inter-row spacing.    </p>		    <h3>Sun</h3>    <p>      The "Soil Mixes" list (page 50) of plant preferences (my      findings for my soil and the New England climate; you'll      work up different ones) suggest that not all varieties need      full sun. Indeed, a good eight hours has proven ample for      anything I've ever grown. Some such as pole beans can get      by with four hours of full sun or eight hours of filtered      sun (as under anti-bug netting or a lacy-leaved locust      tree). Summer lettuce and spinach actually benefit from      growing in the coolness of a moist spot in semi-shade, so      you can set niches in shade of trees or the house.    </p>    <h3>Water</h3>    <p>      If too-wet ground is a problem, you can underlay small      niches with a layer of crushed rock, dig mini-dry wells, or      even set in a few drain tiles (something that takes a major      excavation in a large garden). In dry weather, arranging      trickle-irrigation or hand-watering the absorbent soil      mixed up for niches is easy-and you aren't wasting water on      all that bare inter-row and pathway ground. Or, you can      fill gallon milk jugs with water, punch small holes in the      lids and pinholes in the bottoms, and invert the jugs in      the soil for automatic drip-irrigation.    </p>    <h3>Testing</h3>    <p>      You can test soil moisture by squeezing it into clumps, and      evaluate sand content by rolling it between your thumb and      forefinger and looking at it hard. To check organic matter,      dissolve a 6-inch-long cylindrical core (or a cross-section      slice off the side of an 8-inch-deep hole) of topsoil in a      glass jar filled with warm water; stir well and compare      thicknesses of the several layers that settle: pebbles,      then sand, then clay and loam, then pure loam in density      layers. The darker and thicker the top layers are, the more      loam you have. Half loam is great; 10 percent needs more      compost.    </p>    <p>      But evaluating acidity and nutrient content with accuracy      takes some skill and equipment. It's a good idea to have      your local Cooperative Extension Service or a commercial      lab test your soil before fine-tuning separate niches.      Costs are nominal, and it will give you a base point to      work from. Then, to develop niches with meaningful      differences, you need to evaluate light strength and soil      temperature, assure that the Ph is correct within fairly      precise limits, and accurately access nutrient levels.    </p>    <p>      For this, you really need a set of test instruments. They      needn't be elaborate or costly (after all, you aren't a      USDA Aggy Research Station).    </p>    <p>      A soil-thermometer that's robust enough to hold up to      repeated plungings into soft soil can be found in most seed      catalogs for under $10. A really sturdy model built like an      oven thermometer costs $25 or more. Temp differences will      be most marked in spring and fall as weather changes. You      will be surprised at the variances often +/-10 to 20      degrees-in surface temperatures, between soil under mowed      lawn and under high growth, for example, at the same time      of day, even when both are in full sun.    </p>    <p>      I try to find time to record the sun/ shade/light strength      (with a cheap little reflective photographic light meter)      and temperature of niches early in the day, midday, and in      the afternoon several times a year. Obviously,      full-sun-loving plants want the brightest spots.      Warmth-loving tomatoes, peppers, etc., do best in warm      soil, and plants such as cabbage prefer cool feet. Or, you      can lay black mulch, reduce shade, or set dark-colored,      heat-sink rocks around to warm soil; or add a deep organic      mulch, plant fast-growing shading annuals, or erect a lath      house or net cover to cool the soil.    </p>    <p>      I have tried those little one-piece instruments that have a      probe or two that you stick into the soil to get a readout      on a built-in dial-and found them next to worthless. All      they do is make a very crude reading of the ability of soil      to conduct electricity-which is affected more by      water content than Ph, nitrogen content, or whatever the      meters purport to read. Easier, faster, cheaper, and more      accurate is an inexpensive soil test kit like a a mini      chemistry set that uses reagents, test tubes, and litmus      paper or color-coded readings. My favorite is the      Lustre-Leaf Ph/N/P/K kit that gives you 40 tests (enough      for 10 niches). (Only $14.95, from Johnny's Selected Seeds,      Albion ME 207-437-4301.)    </p>    <p>      Carry a gallon of uncontaminated distilled water (not tap      water or even jugged well water) to clean out the test      vials, and you can do niche garden tests for Ph and      nutrient levels in an hour or two. Values respond slowly to      modification unless you use severe chemicals, so an annual      test is sufficient once you get your niches established.    </p>    <h3>Additives:</h3>    <p>      To increase Ph one half point (say, from 6.0 to 6.5), till      in a good pound (a double handful) of ground limestone per      20 square feet (a niche with sides of 4 and 5 feet). The      same amount of wood ash does the same and works faster, but      doesn't last as long. To decrease Ph make soil more      acid-till a bushel or more of peat moss, leaf, or pine      needle mold into that 20-square-foot niche, and don't lime.      To add nitrogen, add cottonseed meal, grape mast ,or any      other agricultural processing byproduct-or blood meal or      fish meal-into planting holes or seeding trenches. For      phosphorus, add in as much phosphate rock as you added      lime. Or bury a scant handful of bone meal in planting      holes (bury it deep so the household hounds won't dig it up      and make themselves sick). Potassium is best added to      planting holes via green sand, a natural deposit that      sometimes needs a special order from the local feed store,      but is worth it. Or, water with diluted fluid kelp      concentrate, which will also supply trace elements.    </p>    <h3>Water Gardening</h3>    <p>      Many country places host small streams or ponds. And garden      pools, with waterfalls and small streams created by      recirculating stored water with small pumps are becoming      popular garden ornaments. I've expanded on the      country-kid's love of building rock dams in roadside      ditches: I redirected a little year-round stream that      emerges from a rock outcropping in the hill above the house      so it now runs through the niche-plot-sprinkled side yard.      Practically any shady freshwater environment-even a      natural, low, damp spot in the woods ,or one that's      maintained with a dripping hose at the bottom of your      garden, can be used as a salad-green niche, for growing      watercress, for example.    </p>    <p>      Watercress is slow to germinate and takes its time growing,      so its best to start the seed inside at a cool temperature,      between wide strips of coarse, wet fabric. I use burlap      that I keep moist till little sprouts appear, then keeping      it all constantly moist-harden-off the sprouts for a week      on the cold porch, then insert the damp burlap strips in      light shade just at the stream edge. Margins of the cloth      are buried in the wet mud, with rocks placed strategically      to hold the center down. The cress will root and grow at      its own sweet pace, and eventually colonize the bank and      slower-moving water. You will have to grub out weeds that      try to crowd the cress out. Don't over pick; leave a little      rosette of leaves on each stem. Don't pull out the roots      either-this is a perennial.    </p>    <p>      Water in my spring emerges from the rocks deep underground      at a uniform 40°F year-round and encourages the cress      to an early start, so it will provide salad cuttings before      any ground-grown green. A feeding with liquid fertilizer in      fall when water is lowest and the bank driest will do      wonders for next year's production.    </p>    <h3>Plant Neighbors</h3>    <p>      Niches can be surrounded by flowers, lawn, shrubbery, or      weeds. Indeed, a growing number of natural-culture garden      experts believe that a surround of opportunistic weed      species is not only good for the soil, but also good for      cultivated plants. As in the Michigan morning glory      example, a natural growth of native plants serves both to      balance nutrients in the soil and to conceal the often      tender cultivated varieties from pests. Whereas in a      conventional garden, long and orderly rows of are lined up      like pins with unnatural, bare strips at each side,      signaling that your lovingly-raised cabbage transplants are      begging to be mowed down by the first groundhog, aphid, or      flea beetle that happens to drop by. A conventional garden,      with plants lined up for the convenience of mechanical      cultivation, is not a triumph of man over nature's chaos,      but an insult to the natural order-which is not chaos at      all, but a seemingly random function of sun, wind, water,      time, and the hand of the Creator: a many-million-year-old      rationality and organization of a higher order.    </p>    <h3>Managing Weeds</h3>    <p>      Niches can be made nearly self-tending by setting      transplants and fast-sprouting, large-seeded varieties such      as beans through holes in a soil cover of one of those new      landscape fabrics. These fabrics permit air and water to      penetrate, but block sunlight, to keep weed seed from      spouting near enough to your food plants to compete for      food and water; it lies flat with only a rim of soil and a      rock or two in the middle to hold it down, and does not      wind-shred in a single season like old-style black plastic      mulch.    </p>    <p>      You can't direct-sow small-seeded varieties such as lettuce      and carrots through sheeting. I like to sterilize the top      inch or so of soil in smaller, densely planted small seed      niches to kill mold spores, insect and slug eggs, and weed      seed (do this by heating it heat it in an oven at 350°F      with a potato; it's done when the potato cooks through).      Using pelleted carrot seed, and mixing lettuce and other      tiny greens seed with sand and broadcasting it, reduces      need for thinning.    </p>    <p>      Weed seed can blow into even a sterilized niche, and some      help is needed keeping the weeds' rapid and vigorous growth      habit from swamping the vegetables. In small niches, two or      three shallow handhoeings will usually do.    </p>    <p>      In niches too large to sterilize soil, a little Mantis-type      power cultivator is indispensable. Even if it means      delaying planting a little, I like to till three times-a      week apart-in spring before setting out plants. This      killsmost weeds as they sprout.    </p>    <p>      An old-hay mulch applied once soil is warm and summer-dry      will keep weeds down during the growing season. But when      most large, long-term varieties (winter squash, dry beans,      crucifers, tomatoes, peppers) are beyond the vegetative      growth stage and are setting or maturing produce,      permitting ornamental flowers or weeds to grow up around      them creates a living mulch to cool soil and retain      moisture (so long as you mow or top the weeds before they      make seed-especially that double-drafted crabgrass).    </p>    <h3>Planning</h3>		    <p>      Custom-mixing soil for every plant is not for those of us      with time, space, and need or dedication to grow all our      own food. When I was feeding a young family, I grew      potatoes, corn, peas, beans, winter-keeping root      vegetables, and cabbages for quantity and winter-keeping      quality rather than eating quality, ease, and ornamental      value. But, for most of us these days, time for gardening      is scarce, and the trend is smaller gardens, and less but      higher quality-produce. Still, despite all our garden      planning in the chill of February, too many conventional      gardens are overplanted in a burst of spring enthusiasm.      Then, keeping weeds down through the      summer-harvesting even-often becomes an onerous      chore.    </p>    <p>      Selecting and modifying microclimates will make that winter      planning exercise an annual one in experimentation that      will become more sophisticated, productive, and rewarding      as years go by. You might have less production overall than      you get from a big conventional garden. But with well      planned succession-planting of the small, enriched-soil      plots, you will have a constant supply of fresh produce;      none will be wasted, and you'll harvest the most per plant.    </p>    <p>      Any niche is liable to invasion by sod or nearby weed      roots. I keep it out with a barrier made from old      (untreated) wood shingles gleaned from a re-roofing job.      You can also buy plastic edging in rolls, or interlocking      panels. Plastic or overlapping shingles hammered 6 inches      into the soil form a solid shield around the planting soil.      For raised beds, I double up the shingles and leave 3 or 4      inches sticking above soil level; then fill with custom      planting mix.    </p>    <h3>Hanging Baskets</h3>    <p>      My favorite niches aren't snugged into the flower garden,      terraced out of the hillside, or plugged into the roadside      spoil by the telephone poles. They hang from trees,      buildings, arbors, and poles. You've surely seen, and      probably tried, those wire-mesh "summer baskets" lined with      sphagnum moss, filled with growing medium, and sporting      lush annual flowers. How about growing vegetables in them?    </p>    <p>      Commercial basket-plants are often dosed with flowering      hormones to look good at the market, so I'd not recommend      recycling an entire basket. But you can glean used basket      frames in the fall from neighbors or the dump, buy new ones      from florists, or make your own from soft wire or coat      hangers. Leave used frames out over winter or sterilize in      a weak solution of water and laundry bleach. Line with      bark, dumps of native mosses, or live sphagnum from the      florist-or with burlap, horticultural fabric, or any      other sheet material that is permeable so excess water can      flow out. Then, fill with sterilized soil mix, and hang in      full or partial sun from posts, a laundry pole, under tree      limbs or from the porch or windows-indoors or out.    </p>    <p>      You will have to water baskets if rain is scarce; however,      this chore is offset by a virtual lack of pests. Insects      and most disease vectors expect to find flowers and veggies      growing at soil level. Ground pests such as slugs and      ground beetles can't get at hanging baskets. Flying pests      in eating or egg-laying mode seldom fly much higher than      their prey plants. Consider the little greenish-yellow      sulfur butterflies-they lay eggs that produce those      smooth, green caterpillars, which can chew members of the      cabbage family to coleslaw before its picked. You see them      in pairs, rising up in spirals above the garden in their      delightful mating ritual. But, normally they flit about      just at broccoli top altitude. Even if they smelled the fat      cauliflower growing in a basket hanging from the apple      tree, they wouldn't be able to locate it,unless they have      Superbug X-ray vision that can see up through a basket full      of moss and soil. And flying pests like coddling moths and      curculios that are attracted to apples don't care for      broccoli or collards.    </p>    <p>      What to grow in baskets? The smaller leaved hybrid broccoli      and self-blanching cauliflower does well-and there's no      chance for them to get club root. Peppers are good. So are      bush-type summer squash and cucumbers.    </p>    <p>      You can try the hanging-basket culture of (edible) vining      nasturtiums, European (burpless) cucumbers, pati-pan or      other small-fruited summer squash, and even mini-melons. if      you support the fruit in mesh bags. But my favorite      basket-grown plant is everyone's favorite vegetable:      tomatoes.    </p>    <h3>Hanging Tomatoes?</h3>    <p>      Yep. In its semitropical South/CentralAmerican origins, the      tomato is a rampant-growing perennial vine with stems that      kind of inchworm out from the plant base, setting roots and      new plants wherever stems contact soil.    </p>    <p>      For basket-growing, I've done best with wild small-fruited,      "cherry"-type varieties with a rank, wholly indeterminant      growth habit. The vine has no "up-growing" tendency, so the      main stems, and then the suckers that grow from each node,      happily flow over the basket rim, producing great festoons      of small fruit. Johnny's Selected Seeds offers the best      variety, including red, yellow and gold varieties in round      and pear shapes, featuring several newly-released wild and      semi-wild types from Mexico that produce hundreds of      super-rich-flavored little fruit.    </p>    <p>      Full-size, indeterminate plants go into full-bushel-size      baskets. The new Miniature Tiny Tim is a patio-type that      grows no more than a foot high, and can be grown in      gallon-size baskets or hanging ceramic pots with drain      holes and a layer of crushed rock at the bottom. (From the      Canadian seedsmen Vesey's, York P.E.I, COA 1P0, Canada. In      the U.S.: POBox 9000, Calais, ME.)    </p>    <p>      Tomato soil should be low in nitrogen during the early      growth stages, and no healthy plant should be fertilized      till first fruit set. Thereafter, the weather will be      getting hot and summer-dry, and I maintain constant soil      moisture (easily checked by hefting the basket from the      bottom as it hangs) by watering as needed with manure or      compost tea, or a weak solution of soluble 10-5-20 plant      food.    </p>    <p>      If you agree with me that there's no more efficient use of      manufactured fertilizers than to be applied in a weak,      soluble solution as foliar spray or added to a rich organic      soil, you might try the special tomato food Phostrogen:      12.5-5.0-24.5, amended with a full-balanced nutrient      package and the extra calcium needed to prevent blossom-end      rot. (Also from Vesey's.)    </p>    <h3>Look Ma, No Bugs!</h3>    <p>      Think of it, with hanging baskets there'll be no cutworms      to gnaw off your young, hand-raised tomato transplants at      ground level. No tomato hornworms to devour a handful of      leaves overnight. No soil-born rots to ruin ripe fruit or      wither leaves. No slimy slugs sneaking around under your      ground mulch and no marauding mice or voracious voles      nibbling almost-ripe fruit. And with the baskets hanging      open on all sides to the air, you can control soil moisture      at surface and at depth to prevent most rots, wilts, and      mold problems.    </p>    <h3>Mix & Match</h3>    <p>      It's most fun to combine a variety of complimentary or      companion plants in a basket or ground niche. I plug      insect-repelling miniature marigolds into vacant spaces      everywhere. In near-full sun, loose loamy soil, and      moderate moisture, plant your own ratatouille: eggplant,      sprouting broccoli, tomatoes, garlic, sweet onions, and      basil. Off to one side in a niche that will receive      late-season sun, combine parsnips, brussels sprouts, and      leeks-all long season crops for post-frost harvest.    </p>    <p>      In half-shade, cool soil and a super-nitrogen-rich soil,      plant a random scattering of varicolored salad greens. This      year (1997) has been designated "Year of the Mesclun";      that's French for a mix of greens that are snipped off one      leaf at a time as soon as they begin making inch-long leave      sin as little as 14 days. You'll find the seed catalogs      featuring claytonia, mustards, arugula, corn salad,      cresses, endive, orach, purslane, raddicio, tetragonia,      sorrel, a dozen Oriental leaf veggies, and more leaf-type      and loose-head lettuces than you thought existed.    </p>    <p>      Like their cousins the morning glories, sweet potatoes      <em>(Ipomea batatas)</em> are a tropical vine that really      should be grown in planters or hanging baskets, as much for      the luxuriant, happily dangling, bright green foliage with      red stems that lasts all summer as for good eating at      season's end. A mossysided hanging basket with sweet      potatoes planted around the rim so the glossy vines drip      down, and a miniature tomato, a brightly-fruited      mini-pepper plant or a redor white-fringed flowering kale      filling the middle is sure to intrigue visitors to your      niche-garden, almost as much as the 40foot high garlands of      morning glory growing up the telephone pole out front.    </p>    <h3>SOIL MIXES</h3>    <p>      The basis of my niche gardening soil is a mix of half      compost or leaf-mold from the woods, 1/4 vermiculite or per      lite, and the rest a mix of muddy ocean beach sand (for      tilth and ocean trace elements) or common sand and an ocean      seaweed (kelp) concentrate.    </p>    <p>      Further amendments are customized for each plant species.      For tomatoes: to each bushel of mix, I add one handful each      of ground limestone (for long-term Ph-balance and calcium      to prevent blossom-end rot), a little wood ash (for extra      potash and for quick Ph-sweetening), phosphate rock and/or      bone meal (for phosphorous) and greensand (for potassium).      More wood ash is added if needed to reach a Ph of 6.5.    </p>    <p>      To avoid hollow-heart in potatoes, brown-heart in turnips,      black-spot in beets, and as a general tonic for cabbage,      broccoli and other crucifers, carrots, greens including      scallions, garlic, and onions, I add a tablespoon of      20-Mule Team Borax per bushel of balanced nutrient mixes.      This is to provide a good dose of Boron, but don't over do      it.    </p>    <p>      Salad greens, spinach, and any other plants raised for      their leaves are encouraged to make rapid early-stage      (vegetative) growth with extra nitrogen via a generous dose      of cottonseed, fish, or blood meal. Potatoes need a deep,      loose, moderately acid soil with a Ph something just under      6.0, but no lower than 5.0. Leaf or pine-needle mold is a      good addition, along with a sprinkling of gypsum to supply      calcium and sulfur. I save gypsum wallboard from home      remodeling projects, or scrounge it from the town's      demolition dump and crush it with a hand sledge. I remove      all face paper from both sides of the drywall, as it can be      treated with unidentified fireproofing, water seal and      other chemicals I don't want in the soil.    </p>    <p>      I test each batch of soil mix for Ph after moistening a      sample and letting it steep for an hour or more. With our      acid soil, I've never found it too "sweet." Normally, I add      lime and/or wood ash to reduce acid and reach the desired      reading within .3 to .4 points on the Ph scale. This is too      precise a test and too much custom-mixing for a large      garden plot. But its a snap with a trash-barrel full of      light, dry planting soil, or digging the good stuff into a      6-to 24-square-foot niche.    </p>    <p>      Fresh-mixed soil goes into each niche each year-or at least      into the center of each row or container. The "used soil"      that it replaces gets carted, along with old plant roots      and stems, to the compost, where it is interlayered with      kitchen and garden leavings, forest leaf molds, grass      mowings, lime, cottonseed meal when available and sawdust      when its not, and manure.    </p>    <h3>Crop Rotation</h3>    <p>      Its never advisable to grow the same crop family in the      same soil for more than one year in three. Rotation of      varieties with similar growth requirements among niches      offering similar conditions is easy. But when I've found a      location that is absolutely perfect for a single variety, I      rotate soil in the niche-by digging out most of the      planting medium, carting it to the recycling heap, and      replacing it with fresh soil.    </p>    <p>      A lot of digging and hauling you say? I figure that a      plant's root system is shaped like a below-ground mirror      image of its above-ground foliage, and (dry weight of) the      soil that it grows in weighs about the same as the plant      growth. I'd rather haul the soil that grows my      succulent/crunchy homegrown mesclunmix salad greens than      have to carry the greens home from a supermarket after      paying almost $10 a pound for the privilege. Wouldn't you?    </p>
