            		<p>		<strong>GARDEN &YARD</strong>		</p>		    <p>      <strong>The Battle of the      Beetles.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Morth Mather    </h5>                		<p>      In my last article I covered eight of the 17 insects that      have made themselves known to me by damaging crops in my      garden. Though this is the second in a two-part series, I      must go over the philosophy and some basic facts that I      believe should guide every gardener. Without this, a      discussion of insects has the potential for becoming a      handbook for war, "There are bugs in my garden! They must      be eating my babies! Kill! Kill! Kill!"    </p>    <p>      In 25 consecutive gardens in the same spot I can't recall      ever having a crop completely wiped out. Sure, I got a lot      less turnips than I planted one year, but I had planted too      many anyway. We never would have eaten the crop that 100      feet of turnips would have yielded. The aphids did me a      favor by cutting the harvest down to something much more      reasonable.    </p>    <p>      I ran out of potatoes in January this year. In a good year      I have enough potatoes left in the spring for the next      planting. It was rodents rather than insects that damaged      that crop, and I do need to figure out a way to deal with      them. I'm currently trying to befriend a homeless cat that      has been hanging around the house. I hope by providing it      milk it will provide some mouse and mole control. But back      to insects.    </p>    <h3>Public Enemy No....1.7%?</h3>            <p>      I want to do everything possible to get people to think      positively about insects. The vast majority of them are, at      worst, benign. Consider this quote from my favorite insect      reference book:    </p>    <p>      No one knows exactly how many kinds of insects there are,      and figures vary widely even on the number already      described. The fourth edition of <em>Destructive and Useful      Insects</em> (Metcalf, Flint, and Metcalf, 1962) gives      686,000 as the estimated number of described living species      of true insects with perhaps 100,000 of these in North      America. <em>A Field Guide to the Insects</em> (Borror and      White, 1970) gives 88,600 as the number of species in North      America north of Mexico and estimates that perhaps 1,000      insects may be found in any fair-size backyard.    </p>    <p>      Relatively few insects-probably not more than a tenth of      the total number-can be designated as public enemies.      The rest are either harmless or decidedly beneficial.      Without insects, life as we know it today would not exist.      We depend on insects for pollination of 85 percent of our      fruit and many of our vegetables. They play a large role as      scavengers. They provide food for birds and fish. They give      us honey and wax, shellac, cochineal, and silk, and they      have a minor role in surgery and medicine. Practically      every insect order contains some useful species that live      on destructive insects.    </p>    <p>      It is only within the last 30 years, when some chemicals      have reached such a high degree of nonselective efficiency,      that we have learned the extent of the role played by      parasites and predators in reducing harmful insects and      mites. (See <em>The Gardener's Bug Book,</em> Fourth      Edition, by Cynthia Westcott, Doubleday & Co, Inc.,      1973).    </p>    <p>      If there are roughly 1,000 different insect species in the      neighborhood of my garden, and only 17 of them have      attracted my attention by eating my vegetables, then the      percentage of potential problem insects is 1.7. To focus      the majority of the attention on these few insects is a      distortion of the real world. It is a gross      misrepresentation. It is like being afraid of going to a      city because all you ever hear about is all of the bad      things that happen to people.    </p>    <p>      I actually look upon that small percentage of species of      insects that eat garden plants as the most important. After      all, they care about the same thing I do. What possible      good could a mosquito be to a garden? Mosquitoes don't care      about plants. The number of mosquitoes in my garden tells      me nothing about the health of the garden. And it would      take a tremendous number of them to add anything to the      soil. Their greatest value may be in telling me when it is      time to leave the garden in the evening.    </p>    <p>      Aphids, on the other hand, send me an important message.      When there is an aphid infestation on a row of plants, I      know that the plants are under stress. The aphids are not      causing the stress. They are indicating that there is      stress, something they can sense that I can't. The plants      look fine to me.    </p>    <p>      Consider another indicator-the oil light in a car. When      this warning light comes on, you know that there is a      problem that must be attended to right away. You pull into      a garage and tell them the oil light is on. They reach      behind the dash and pull out a little light bulb. Showing      it to you they say, "There, this won't come on again:' And      you are on your way, right? Yeah, right, but not for very      long because, of course, the bulb was not the problem. It      was indicating a problem in the engine, a problem that if      not fixed soon, will develop into a larger problem.    </p>    <p>      We should look upon insects that eat our vegetables as      indicators of a larger problem. The problem might be that      we planted a particular crop too early, and it is      struggling in soil that is too cool for it to grow      vigorously. Or the trouble may be too much or too little      water. But it is usually an imbalance in soil nutrients,      either too little or too much of one of the 17 elements      necessary for the healthy growth of most plants.    </p>        <p>      In my previous article I dealt mostly with      <em>Lepidoptera.</em> These butterflies and moths lay eggs      on plants, that hatch into caterpillars. The caterpillars      eat until maturity, are transformed into a pupa, and then      molt to become a winged insect again.    </p>    <p>      Most of this article will be about beetles. Beetles also      fly and lay eggs. The eggs hatch into grubs, and it is in      this phase that they gain the most weight. However, adult      beetles also eat and are sometimes a greater problem than      the grubs. The Japanese beetle probably springs to mind for      many. I remember handpicking Japanese beetles from our      grape arbor in New Jersey when I was growing up. While I      have seen a few in my garden from time to time, they are      not much of a problem in Maine. I have seen traps out for      them, so I guess they are bothering some people.    </p>        <p>      I'll start with the smallest: flea beetles. I wasn't sure      how that should be spelled at first. They are hardly bigger      than a flea but when you approach them, they flee. This      quick movement makes it impossible to handpick them, so you      can rule that out as a control method.    </p>    <p>      I have observed damage from flea beetles on baby plants and      transplanted seedlings of tomato, pepper, eggplant, potato,      radish, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, cucumber, and      squash. They make small holes in the leaves. In the case of      transplants like tomatoes, peppers and eggplant, I often      feel they are doing me a favor by cutting back the leaf      mass to help put it in balance with the roots that were      damaged during the ordeal of transplanting. The damage to      the young cucumber and squash plants is minimal. It      probably only occurs when the seeds germinate early and the      warm weather that allowed them to do so is followed by cold      weather that causes the plants to grow very slowly, if at      all. If slow growth continues for too long, the beetles      will severely damage the plant, but warm weather usually      returns in time to promote vigorous growth that quickly      overwhelms the damage.    </p>    <p>      There are only three plants that suffer significantly from      flea beetles-radishes, broccoli, and cauliflower. The      radishes always make it in the end, but the first couple of      plantings attract so many flea beetles that I usually      expect them not to survive. Broccoli and cauliflower      directly seeded in the garden have had their baby leaves      completely eaten. At least I think it was flea beetles. One      day I had a foot-long row of inch-high seedlings with flea      beetles poking holes in the tender leaves. The next day      there were just stems. It could be that something else came      along in the night, or it could be that I ignored the      plants for more than overnight, but damage to these      seedlings by flea beetles has been enough in successive      years for me to change my practices. Flea beetles like this      crop a lot, and the best way for me to get broccoli and      cauliflower is to start the seedling in flats.    </p>    <p>      The frustrating thing is that I used to plant short rows,      just a foot for each, and then transplant from these short      rows.    </p><p>As a lazy gardener, I try to plant in the garden whenever    possible and let nature take care of water, light, and    nutrients. The flea beetles made it necessary for me to    replant, which was more work. I could cover the seedbed with    gauze, but that was another thing to worry about. I finally    reached the conclusion that the easiest way to get broccoli    and cabbage seedlings started was to grow them in a small    flat. I do have to water it even if I leave it outside,    because the soil in a flat dries out much faster than garden    soil. Also, the garden soil can pull moisture from below, but    the flat can't. I rationalize that the extra effort of    watering is balanced by the easier task of transplanting from    a flat rather than from a garden seedbed.</p>    <p>      The flea beetles go after the transplants, of course. The      trick is to make the transition easy enough so the plants      have a minimal setback. By taking care that the roots are      not severely damaged, that the soil is in good contact with      the roots, and that the plants get plenty of water, the      transplants will start growing vigorously enough to outpace      the flea beetle's feeding.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly, flea beetles are around all summer and go      through a couple of generations in our climate, yet I am      only aware of them in the spring. Another fascinating thing      is that I have never been aware of their larval stage.      Since their larval stage in not mentioned in any of my      reference books, I guess it isn't important, but it is      still interesting because beetles do most of their growing      in the larval stage. Once it becomes a beetle, it is fully      grown. Flea beetles are 1/10-inch long, and their eggs are      minuscule. It is going to take a lot of them to make a big      difference.    </p>    <p>      If you have some plants that appear to be losing the battle      against flea beetles, you can literally shoo them away and      use gauze or an agricultural row cover. The row cover has      the added advantage of warming the soil, which will      probably help the plants grow more vigorously. I have done      this with cucumbers and squash. I think flea beetles are      most often an indicator that I am trying to grow a plant in      soil too cold for it.    </p>         <p>      There is no soil too cold for asparagus, because it is a      perennial. The crowns send up shoots from a foot or so deep      in the ground when the temperature or the soil or some      cosmic signal tells it to. Since I exercise no control over      the growth of this plant, I take no credit or blame for      timing. There are two kinds of asparagus beetle: asparagus      beetle and spotted asparagus beetle. They are both slender      beetles, about 1/4"-inch long, and have spots. The regular      asparagus beetle is black with yellow spots, and the      spotted one is orange with black spots. I don't have      problems with either of them. Actually, they are kind of      attractive on the plants. There may be a few around while      I'm harvesting and may eat a little of the head of the      asparagus, causing it to be bent or look chewed up. That is      not good for market, but it doesn't bother me. When I sold      asparagus I don't recall ever having to hold out any to      make the bunches perfect.    </p>    <p>      The beetles come in greater numbers after I have stopped my      harvest and the plants are maturing into ferns. I suppose      the foliage they eat may decrease the plants' ability to      store energy in the crown, which may decrease the crop the      next year. They have never completely defoliated a plant,      so I have not given them any concern.    </p>        <p>      Cucumber beetles have caused delays in my first cucumber of      the year. Some may think that because I have had to replant      broccoli or cucumbers I should call it a crop loss to      insects. There have been years when, if I had not      replanted, I would not have had broccoli or cucumbers. But      I did replant. The damage was done very early in the      season, so there was plenty of time to do the job again.      Being lazy, I would rather not have to do the job again.      Being competitive, I would rather have the crop come in as      early as possible. Being philosophical, I accept what is      and go on from there.    </p>    <p>      Cucumber beetles are about the same size and shape as      asparagus beetles. There are striped and spotted varieties.      The spotted is greenish yellow with black spots. The      striped, the one I am most familiar with, is yellow with      three black stripes. It starts flying in the spring before      the cucumbers or squash have sprouted. When their favorite      crop appears, they will do some eating of the leaves, but      this damage is minimal. What really hurts is if they lay      eggs on the ground under the plant or on the stem at ground      level. When the eggs hatch, the thin, white wormlike larvae      feed on the roots. Since this is hidden from view, it goes      unnoticed until it is too late to do much other than plant      again. In 25 years of gardening, I can only recall having      this problem once. I kept looking at the cucumber plants,      and they just weren't doing much of      anything-virtually no growth. I planted another hill,      leaving the first for observation. Ultimately this plant      grew enough to have some flowers and cucumbers, but its      output was not worth the effort of tending it.    </p>    <p>      I usually let nature take its course, meaning that I plant      and observe what happens. There have been some years that I      have put gauze over the hills of cucumbers and squash. This      really is a pretty good idea for several reasons. It will      act as a barrier to cucumber beetles and flea beetles. It      will also warm the soil several degrees above the      temperature of uncovered soil, which helps these      warm-loving crops. Covering a hill is really about the      easiest plant protection I can think of. If the hill is I      foot in diameter, a 2-foot square of gauze will cover it.      The edges of the gauze can be covered with soil, or the      corners held down with stones. The plants will be protected      until they get their first true leaves. At this point, they      should be strong enough and the weather warm enough so that      the plants can out grow any damage from insects.    </p>    <p>      Now a little pride (I hope not arrogance) creeps in. Seldom      have I used this preventative measure and seldom have I had      a problem. If I use the gauze, I can't prove my plants are      so healthy that they won't attract cucumber beetles. As for      whether or not the beetles are in the vicinity consider      this: "...woodlands near the vegetable garden, under leaves      or rotting logs, in lowland hedgerows, or near wild food      plants such as goldenrod and aster..." This is actually a      description from <em>The Gardener's Bug Book</em> of the      winter habitat for stripped cucumber beetles. It is as      close a description of the land around my garden as I could      give.    </p>    <p>      I see cucumber beetles in the garden all summer long. They      don't eat much. I handpick them if they are conveniently      located and I'm in the mood. They are somewhat cagey      though, and frequently fly at my approach. They are blamed      for spreading bacterial wilt and cucumber mosaic. My      cucumbers and squash occasionally get some late disease. I      haven't bothered to figure out what it is because it comes      so late in the season that I really don't care much. I'm      not even certain it is a disease, though it probably is. At      first I thought the plants had just reached maturity and      were dying of old age. I am obviously not a good one to      talk to about plant diseases, since my motto is "Ignore it.      Maybe it didn't happen."    </p>        <p>      There is one beetle in my garden that is difficult to      ignore. The Colorado potato beetle is hard-shelled, very      broad (3/8" x 1/4 inches), very convex, and yellow with 10      longitudinal black lines. It is a perfect example of a      native insect that suddenly became dangerous to cultivated      plants. For many years this beetle lived on the sandbur      weed on high plateaus at the base of the Rocky Mountains.      It was described in 1824 and had probably been around as an      obscure beetle for a long time. But the pioneer settlers of      the West brought with them the potato, which the beetle      found much to its taste. In a short time this almost      unknown insect became, under the title of "potato bug," the      best-known insect in America. It migrated eastward at the      rate of about 85 miles a year, following potato plantings,      appearing in Nebraska in 1859, Illinois in 1864, Ohio in      1869, reaching the Atlantic coast by 1874. Eventually it      made its way to Europe, where it is well established in      France, Holland, Belgium, Spain, parts of Italy, and in      other countries. It appeared in England but was eradicated      there. It is now a problem throughout the United States      except in parts of Florida, Nevada, and California.    </p><p>The Colorado potato beetle humbles me. I have to admit    that it has come to my garden in numbers that can defoliate    plants. I have to admit that it comes in worrisome numbers    more often than not. But I have some experiences that support    my belief that healthy plants in a healthy soil do not    attract insect pests. One year a woman dropped by to ask if I    could show her what a potato beetle looks like. It was    perhaps my best year for potatoes. The rows were at their    peak of growth and though I had not done anything to    discourage them, there were no signs of potato beetles. I    looked down the rows and saw one plant that looked smaller    than the rest. I went to it, pulled back the leaves exposing    the undersides, and sure enough found three clusters of    beetle eggs to show my guest. Some more looking and I was    able to show her a couple of adult beetles.</p>    <p>      After she left, I went back to the potatoes and checked      more plants. The rest were free of any egg clusters.    </p>    <p>      Another year I planted potatoes in the market garden, not      because I was planning to sell them, but because potatoes      are said to like new soil. One day, when the plants were      nearing full size, I pulled back several to check for egg      clusters. They seemed to be averaging about one cluster per      plant. I was too busy at the time to pick eggs from      200-foot rows and I never got back to them. To my amazement      I never saw any grubs or any damage to the plants. I can't      imagine that I checked the only plants with egg clusters,      but if there were more, why didn't they hatch?    </p><p>Those two years were exceptions. It would seem more    reasonable to attribute the paucity of beetles to a    fluctuation in their population in the area, probably due to    the weather. I have concentrated on the soil for potatoes    many years, hoping that I would get it just right and there    would be an exceptional year that I could attribute to my    husbandry of the soil. Perhaps mulching with leaves would be    the secret. Perhaps planting in new soil. Perhaps rotating    alter corn, a grass. Perhaps planting next to beans, a    companion crop. My quest continues. As a Taurus, I don't give    up easily.</p>    <p>      In the meantime, how do I get a crop? Until recently there      was only one control that I found acceptable: handpicking.      This is an honorable practice and reasonable in a garden.      Before chemicals it was also the only practice for a      farmer. To control potato beetles by handpicking, you need      to know a little bit about them. First, the adults pop out      of the ground about the same time the plants do, if you are      planting as early as possible. Planting later is one way to      decrease their damage. The beetles that over wintered in or      near your garden may fly away in search of food if they      don't find it to be handy.    </p>    <p>      The adults fly around looking for each other and for a good      place to lay eggs. They eat a little but not enough to be a      problem. They may be tasting plants to make sure they have      found a good one for their offspring. They lay eggs on the      underside of leaves of potato plants or other members of      the same family (eggplant, tomatoes, and deadly      nightshade). The egg clusters are bright yellow-orange and      a good size for crushing between thumb and forefinger. The      eggs hatch in four to seven days-very important. The      difference, as you might imagine, is caused by the air      temperature: Handpicking is best done before the eggs      hatch, which means that the plants should be checked once a      week in cool weather and every four days when it is hot and      humid and you don't feel like doing it.    </p>    <p>      When the eggs hatch, a small brick-red grub (about the size      of a pinhead) emerges and heads for the top of the plant,      where the most tender leaves are emerging. Not all of the      bugs make it to the top. Some will eat pretty much where      they started. Others will end up heading out toward the      ends of leaves and stems other than the main one. The      result is that instead of crushing them all with one pinch,      you now have a dozen or more individual bugs to hunt down      in various locations. They go from pinhead size to the size      of adult beetles in about two weeks. To get to this size      requires a lot of eating-not particularly good for the      plants. The bigger the grubs get, the messier they are when      squeezed, as you might imagine.    </p>    <p>      I tried to entice my children into picking potato beetles.      I couldn't very well pay them for the number of crushed egg      clusters-who could count them? The kids could pick the      grubs, and then we could weigh or count them, but that      seemed like a bore-plus, it took away the incentive for      removing the clusters before they got out of hand. Then I      hit upon the scheme of offering $50 to keep the plants free      of grubs. I would check every week and deduct a nickel for      each grub or cluster I found. And I would give them a      couple of hours notice before I checked. I guess I didn't      present it properly because I never interested either Josh      or Caitlin in this enterprise. It was my plan from the      beginning to never turn my children off to gardening by      making it a place of unpleasantness, so I couldn't force      them to do the job.    </p>    <p>      My own handpicking worked pretty well most years. I would      be fairly diligent when the timing was once a week. It      didn't take too much effort to travel up and down the rows,      pulling the plants back to expose the undersides of the      leaves. The yellow-orange clusters are easy to spot and a      pinch crushes the eggs. Heat and humidity slow me down just      when the eggs start hatching faster. At about this time the      plants are in flower and growing so vigorously that I feel      they may be able to take care of themselves. There have      been some years when some plants were completely      defoliated. I have no doubt that the harvest has been      diminished because of the beetles. However, most years I      have harvested the three or four bushels we need to get      through the winter.    </p>    <p>      Two or three years ago a new strain of Bt <em>(Bacillus      thuringiensis var. san diego) was</em> developed. This is a      bacterial disease that will kill Colorado potato beetle      larvae and nothing else. While I think the precautionary      advice on the label (that it be kept out of the reach of      children, that contact and inhalation be avoided and that      it be kept out of lakes, ponds, or streams) should be      followed, I feel much more comfortable using it than I      would any chemical insecticide. I find this insecticide      acceptable for use in my garden primarily because it does      not kill innocent insects. However, whenever I use it, I      recognize that I have not yet found the real problem. I am      pulling the warning light bulb rather than fixing the real      problem.    </p>        <p>      Cynthia Westcott says the Mexican bean beetle is "doubtless      the worst enemy of eastern home vegetable gardens." It has      not been so for me, but I'm not going to take any credit      for this one. I haven't heard other Maine gardeners talk      much about this relative of the lady beetle, so I suspect      that it just doesn't like our weather very much. Like the      Colorado potato beetle, the Mexican bean beetle spread      across the country from Mexico. I have had it visit my      garden. There might be one or two hatches in the whole bean      patch. Only one year were there enough to merit my      attention.    </p>    <p>      The Mexican bean beetle is about the size of the potato      beetle and the shape of a ladybug. It is a metallic yellow      to tan with eight black spots on each wing. Like the potato      beetle, it is the grub that does the most damage. The grub      is yellow with what the books call spines. I call it fuzzy.      It eats from the bottom of the leaf and turns leaves into      lace. It will also eat the beans, which makes it even more      of a pest. Egg dusters and the grubs can be handpicked or      crushed. Both are found on the undersides of the leaves.    </p>    <p>      There are no sprays for this beetle that will not kill more      innocent insects than guilty ones. Some reference books say      that there are resistant varieties, though I have found      little evidence of such resistance. <em>Organic Plant      Protection,</em> edited by Roger B. Yepsen, Jr. (Rodale      Press, Inc.), suggests a number of companion plants that      may keep the beetle away. One of those is potatoes, and I      always plant potatoes and beans next to each other. That      may have something to do with my lack of Mexican bean      beetles, but I doubt it. This book also mentions some      home-concocted sprays involving wormwood, garlic, mint,      matricaria, wild morning glory, and cedar. I think anything      is worth a try, but I am loath to pass on any home remedy      that has not been properly tested. That is not to say that      we have to get scientists involved. We have to be willing      to keep a control factor in our tests. In other words, if      we are going to spray garlic juice, we should only do so on      half the plants. If it seems to do some good, we need to      test it again in another year, again with a control.    </p>    <p>      That's it for the beetles that have done damage in my      garden. Lest you are down on beetles, remember that the      best friend we have is a beetle. Ladybugs have a voracious      appetite for aphids and scale insects. Adult ladybugs will      eat about 50 aphids a day. In the larval stage they eat      about 25 aphids a day. A single larva has been known to      consume 90 adult and 3,000 larval-scale insects during its      lifetime. Don't ask me who counted them.    </p>    <p>      I don't think I would buy ladybugs unless I was trying to      repopulate an area where a lot of spraying had been done.      The problem with bringing them in from somewhere else is      that they may not have enough to eat, in which case they      will either fly away or die. Better to keep from      interrupting the natural balance in and around your garden.      If there are a lot of aphids in your garden one year, there      is a good chance that a ladybug will find out about it and      decide your garden is a good place to start a family.    </p>        <p>      The squash bug is the only true bug that calls attention to      itself in my garden. While we think of most insects as      bugs, entomologists are more selective. Their bugs have      some specific traits like front wings that are leathery and      back wings that are membranous. Bugs have a gradual      metamorphosis with the nymphs looking like adults without      wings.    </p>    <p>      The squash bug is shield-shaped, and if you have ever      squashed one you probably remember the smell. The eggs are      laid on the undersides of leaves and are hard to squash. I      usually get a hatch or two on my summer squash fairly late      in the season. By the time I see them, the nymphs are      usually nearing their last of the five molts they go      through before adulthood. There are usually a lot of them      in the same place often on the same leaf. I just clap the      leaf between my hands and squash most of them in one      impulsive move. The smell doesn't bother me. If they were      more of a bother, I would probably look for the eggs, which      hatch in seven to 14 days.    </p><p>Squash bugs probably get on my winter squash, but there    is such a tangle of vines and no need to get involved with    them on a regular basis that I don't see them. They inject a    poison into plants they feed on, which causes leaves to turn    brown. It may be that some of the times I thought I had a    wilt of some kind, it was squash bugs.</p>        <p>      Root maggots and leaf miners are both the larval stage of a      fly. Leaf miners hatch from eggs on the undersides of      leaves. The maggot gets in between the top and bottom      layers of the leaf and feeds there. Even if you wanted to      use a poison, it wouldn't affect a leaf miner, at least not      until the damage was done. The damage shows up as mottled      leaves or light patches. I have had them in spinach, Swiss      chard, and beets, all of the same family, so it is probably      the same fly.    </p>    <p>      In the case of root maggots, the fly lays its eggs at the      base of the plant. When the egg hatches, the maggot digs      in, feeding on the root. If it is a root crop like      radishes, turnips, carrots, or rutabagas, you will see the      damage at harvest. Radishes are in the ground such a short      time, the maggot is likely still there in the radish. Root      maggots in the roots of cabbage may retard the growth of      the plant, or it may wilt and even die. In any of these      cases, if there is a lot of damage to root crops or if      other plants wilt, take it as an indication that the plants      are under stress.    </p>    <p>      I remember having a debate about organic methods with a      commercial vegetable grower. At one point he asked what I      did about root maggots on radishes. "I grow healthy plants      in a healthy soil. I don't have root maggots."    </p>    <p>      "My plants are healthy," he retorted. "Dave," a friend of      his piped in, "you don't have any earthworms in your soil."    </p>    <p>      "What's that got to do with it?"    </p>    <p>      "That's what he's talking about. Healthy Soil has      earthworms."    </p>
