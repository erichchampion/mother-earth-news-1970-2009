                        <p>      For cruising or commuting, an electric car or bike is the      most energy-efficient, economical, reliable and fun      transportation option. Electric vehicles (EVs) also are the      cleanest vehicles on the road today: No smog-producing      pollution pours from their tailpipes, qualifying them for      zero-emission status.    </p>    <p>      A little sports car, like the Sunbeam pictured at      left,<br />      is a good candidate for an electric motor conversion.<br />      (See "Go Electric" )    </p>    <p>      Large auto and oil companies say this claim is just smoke      and mirrors, that EVs are just "emission-elsewhere"      vehicles, and that pollution from the electric power plants      that charge EVs offsets any gain in local air quality. But      that's simply not true, say the California Air Quality      Management Districts and the California Energy Commission.      Their studies find coal-fired electric power plants operate      at efficiencies three times that of cars with gasoline      engines. Transportation via internal combustion engines      that use gas and oil is responsible for more than 17      percent of the greenhouse gas emissions on the planet. In      industrialized countries, cars spew 75 percent of carbon      monoxide emissions, 48 percent of nitrogen oxide (smog) and      40 percent of hydrocarbon pollutants into the atmosphere.      <strong>Mile for mile, electric vehicles travel with      one-half the resource depletion and one-fifteenth the air      pollution.</strong>    </p>    <p>      EVs are easily three to four times more efficient than      internal combustion engines. While the major automotive and      oil industries point out the limited amount of energy a      battery pack contains relative to a tank of gasoline, they      fail to address an ugly truth about internal combustion      engine technology: The engine itself wastes an average of      60 percent of any fuel's energy, whether it's gasoline,      diesel, alcohol, methane, compressed natural gas, propane,      bio-fuel or hydrogen. Engines waste this energy as heat,      vibration and exhaust. The silence of an electric vehicle      is a mute testament to its efficiency.    </p>    <p>      ELECTRIC VEHICLE NUTS & BOLTS    </p>    <p>      EVs use electric motors instead of engines for propulsion,      and use electricity from batteries instead of getting power      from fossil fuels. Look under the hood of an EV and you'll      find an electric motor about the size of a 5-gallon water      bottle bolted to a standard transmission. The vehicle's      accelerator pedal is linked to an electronic controller,      and pressing the accelerator smoothly delivers power to the      electric motor in proportion to the degree the pedal is      pressed, the same as with a gas engine.    </p>    <p>      Instead of a fuel tank, batteries store the energy that      powers the car. Drivers of cars with internal combustion      engines choose what oil company they want to dole their      dollars to, but electric vehicle drivers determine the      source of their energy: Some choose utility-supplied      electricity, while others tap into homescale power plants,      such as wind machines, solar-electric arrays or small      hydroelectric systems. The EV then becomes not only a      zero-emission, but a zero pollution vehicle when renewable      energy systems are used for power.    </p>    <p>      Operating an EV is virtually identical to driving a car      with an engine. <em>There are</em> some <em>differences      in</em> the dash controls, <em>meters and</em> other      hardware, but no more than someone might discover in the      features of any other new car model. The most important      controls, such as the steering, brakes, accelerator pedal      and gears (if any), are identical to those found in a car      with an engine.    </p>        <h3>      WHY DRIVE ELECTRIC?    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Virtually maintenance-free.</strong> With only      three moving parts in the electric motor (one armature and      two bearings), electric propulsion systems are designed to      last for two decades or more. Few moving parts means few      things to repair, unlike gasoline-powered vehicles. The      only maintenance required for an electric propulsion system      consists of checking the battery pack every six months. And      after two to five years of use, the battery pack will need      to be replaced. (See "Banking on Batteries," .)    </p>    <p>      <strong>It's cheaper.</strong> Even with the need to      recycle the vehicle's battery bank every few years, the      cost to operate an EV is lower than driving a car with an      internal combustion engine (see "Comparing Gas and      Electric," ). <strong>The average full-size EV has a 15      kilowatt-hour (kwh) battery pack, which at 8  cents/kwh      costs $1.20 to fully recharge for a range of 45      miles.</strong> Mile for mile, EV drivers pay less.    </p>    <p>      Under the Qualified Electric Vehicle Credit (Internal      Revenue <em>Service Form 8834; www.irs.gov ),</em> current      <em>federal tax</em> incentives offer up to a 10      <em>percent credit</em> based on the cost of an EV, up to      <em>$4,000</em> for each <em>vehicle. Hybrid-electric</em>      vehicles, which are not <em>powered primarily</em> by      electric motors, do not qualify, but pan of the cost of      these vehicles may be eligible for a clean-fuel-vehicle      deduction up to $2,000. IRS Publication <em>535</em>      details the criteria for taking a credit on hybrid-electric      vehicles. Your state may also offer tax incentives: Visit      the Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Vehicle Web site at      <em>www.fleets.doe.gov</em> and click on the "Incentives      and Laws" link. California recently enacted a tax credit of      up to $9,000 for new <em>electric vehicles, the</em> most      proactive state measure to date.    </p>    <p>      <strong>It's better for the environment.</strong>      Containing air pollution from a single power plant's      smokestack is far easier than controlling the tailpipe      emissions from millions of cars. Engines are even more      inefficient and pollute more heavily until they reach      operating temperature. And pollution from the off-gassing      of oil-soaked engines continues long after the car's hot      engine is turned off. The difference is so great between      internal combustion engines and electric motors that, in      California, a singly occupied EV qualifies to use the car      pool lane.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Silent operation.</strong> A blessing of electric      propulsion is that there's no motor vibration. The lack of      this constant vibration adds to the feeling of the smooth,      elegant ride found only in luxury cars and most EVs.    </p>    <p>      Although an EV's motor or controller may <em>sing</em> a      bit at high speeds, under heavy loads or when climbing      steep grades, an EV is so quiet that its driver must      exercise caution in parking lots. Unaware of the EV's      presence, pedestrians may step out in front of the vehicle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Performance.</strong> Most EVs are fully capable of      quick acceleration, fast hill climbing and maintaining      highway speeds. However, any of these practices will reduce      the effective range of a fully charged battery pack.    </p>    <p>      Just as jackrabbit starts and high speeds waste      electricity, they also waste fuel. Most cars with engines      have no meters-except the singular path of the fuel      gauge's needle from full to empty-to help the driver      understand which habits are the most wasteful. An EV's      monitoring system reveals the high cost of a lead-foot on      the pedal, and helps the operator learn how to drive more      efficiently.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Range.</strong> Current battery technology sets      limits on the vehicle's maximum range. But the average      commute in the United States is only 25 miles, and      virtually every EV has twice this range in a standard      driving cycle. Conservative driving can stretch the range      to almost 75 miles. (See "Wise Driving Tips for EVs," .)      Where a commute may stretch 50 to 70 miles one way, it is      usually a simple matter to plug the vehicle into a charging      outlet at work. At the end of the workday, a fully charged      EV is ready to make the trek homeward.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Regenerative braking.</strong> In an engine-powered      car, when the driver first accelerates to speed and then      must brake hard to stop, all of the energy expended is      wasted as heat in the vehicle's brakes. Regenerative      braking, a feature found only in EVs and hybrid-electric      cars, captures about 30 percent of this energy and recycles      it to recharge the battery pack. Circuitry in the      controller makes the electric motor act temporarily like a      generator, producing electricity that is routed to the      batteries.    </p>    <p>      Regenerative braking, which occurs whenever the driver lets      up on the accelerator or applies the brakes steadily,      handles 80 percent of all vehicle braking situations,      minimizing the need for using the vehicle's hydraulic      brakes. This lessens the wear on brake drums, rotors and      pads.    </p>        <h3>      FOR GROCERIES OR GREAT GETAWAYS    </h3>    <p>      Whether you need transportation for running errands, for      commuting to the neighborhood office, for highway travel or      distance driving, there's an EV to meet your need.    </p>    <p>      Neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) are light-duty EVs      designed primarily for streets, not highways. NEVs are      fairly inexpensive vehicles, convenient to use, park and      maintain, and are perfect as a family's second car. Most      will travel speeds of 25 mph, and have room for two people      and storage for groceries.    </p>    <p>      The NEV is usually classified as a low-speed vehicle, and      is federally approved to be driven on community streets      with posted speed limits of 35 mph or less. Thirty-five      states recognize this low-speed vehicle classification of      EVs.    </p>    <p>      "People who don't know how to use an NEV think it's not for      them," says Global Electric Motorcars President Ken      Montler. "Yet once they ride in one, they can't stop      thinking about how it can be used."    </p>    <p>      The <strong>GEM</strong> (Global Electric Motorcar, owned      by DaimlerChrysler Co.) is a four-passenger, front-wheel      drive, street-legal NEV. It has a 25 mph top speed, a range      of 30 to 40 miles, stands as tall as a minivan and has an      optional weather enclosure to protect against rain, wind      and sun. It comes with a 5-horsepower direct-current motor,      a 48- or 72-volt flooded-cell, lead-acid battery pack, and      an onboard 110-volt overnight charger. Expect to pay about      $8,350 for a GEM [(888) 871 4367; www.gemcar.com ].    </p>    <p>      Ford Motor Company's <strong>Th!nk Neighbor,</strong>      intended for short neighborhood commutes, has both two- and      four-passenger options, with a payload up to 900 pounds. It      can travel about 30 miles on one charge, with a top speed      of 25 mph. The Neighbor starts at about $6,495 for the      two-seater model [(800) 252-4221; www.thinkmobility.com ].    </p>    <p>      Eugene, Oregon-based Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Company      makes the <strong>Gizmo,</strong> a one-seat, fully      enclosed commuter vehicle that can travel up to 45 miles on      a single charge, and cruise at speeds up to 40 mph. You can      pick up a Gizmo for about $8,650 [(541) 687-5939; www.      nevco. com].    </p>    <p>      With a combination of pedal power and electric power,      <strong>Kronosport's</strong> little electric vehicles can      carry a driver and more than 350 pounds of extra cargo.      Using the electric motor only, they have a top speed of 12      mph, and a range of 24 to 36 miles per charge. Combining      pedal power with the electric motor more than doubles the      range. Ed Kron, the founder and president of Kronosport,      uses his Truck to help out with homesteading chores, and      Kronosport Vans, Bikes and Taxis are currently planned for      use by the Philadelphia police department, airport, parks      and recreation department, and zoo. Price range from $5,800      for the Truk to $6,500 for the Taxi or Van [(215) 575-7614;      www.kronosport.com].    </p>    <h3>      COMMUTING CARS    </h3>    <p>      Although most privately owned EVs in the United States      (estimated at 5,000) are conversions of cars initially      manufactured with gasoline engines (see "Go Electric," ),      in California. Toyota currently offers the <strong>RAV4      EV,</strong> a battery- only, five-passenger, four-door      sport utility vehicle that can travel 126 miles on a single      charge. Toyota says more than 1,000 fleet-tested RAV4 EVs      have demonstrated high reliability and low service      requirements. The RAV4 EV has a top speed of 78 mph. Expect      to pay around $42,510 for this EV (rav4ev. toyota. com ).    </p>    <p>      The <strong>Corbin Sparrow</strong> is a one-person,      three-wheel, freeway legal EV with a range of 30 to 50      miles. The Sparrow sports an all weather composite shell,      contains an LED dashboard display, and registers, insures      and parks as a motorcycle in most states. It has a curbside      door, heater and defroster, radio and compact disc player,      two power ports for a phone and laptop computer, and 6      cubic feet of luggage space. It retails for about $14,900      [(831) 635-1033; www.corbinmotors.com ].    </p>    <p>      Ford's <strong>Th!nk City</strong> is a two-passenger      commuter vehicle constructed with an aluminum safety frame      and a driver's side air bag. It can travel speeds up to 56      mph, and has a range of almost 50 miles. The City, which      will make its debut during the summer of 2003, will cost      about $20,000.    </p>    <p>      HEAD FOR THE HILLS WITH HYBRID-ELECTRIC VEHICLES    </p>    <p>      Hybrid EVs (HEVs) pair a gasoline engine with an electric      motor, significantly extending vehicle travel range. Around      town. most HEVs use their electric motors and engage the      engine only during highway driving, combining low emissions      in populated areas with excellent fuel economy on the      highways.    </p>    <p>      The hybrid EVs currently on the market are "parallel"      types, meaning the engine and electric motor separately      drive the wheels. Batteries in these HEVs are not recharged      by plugging them in to utility electricity, but by the      HEV's own gasoline engine.    </p>    <p>      The Honda <strong>Insight</strong> is a sleek two-door      hatchback. At 61 miles per gallon in the city and 68 mpg on      highway, the Insight boasts the highest fuel economy of the      vehicles available in the HEV class. Range on one tank of      gas averages 620 miles. Maximum load, including passengers,      is 365 pounds. The Insight sells for about $19,000.    </p>    <p>      In spring 2002, Honda released its <strong>hybrid      Civic</strong> model, a four-door compact car with seating      capacity for five passengers, and ample trunk space. Hybrid      Civics claim city and highway mileage of 46 and 51 mpg. The      price for a base model is about $20,010 <em>(      civichybrid.honda.com</em> and <em>www.hondacars.com</em>      <em>).</em>    </p>    <p>      Toyota's Prius is a four-door vehicle that was tested by      Consumer Reports at 30 mpg in the city and 49 mpg on the      highway, averaging 41 mpg overall. The range on one tank of      gas averages 545 miles.    </p>    <p>      The <strong>Prius</strong> can fit up to five adults, and      can carry a maximum load of 800 pounds. A base model sells      for about $21,000 <em>( www.toyota.com ).</em>    </p>    <p>      HEVs to be released in the next two years include sport      utility vehicles, like the Ford Escape HEV and      DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Durango HEV, and the Dodge RAM HEV      Contractor Special, a full-size pickup.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <div class="image">        <img src="../images/194-042-01tab.jpg" alt="194-042-01tab.jpg" width="311" height="602" />      </div>      <h3>        Wise Driving Tips for EVs      </h3>      <p>        The slower an EV is driven, the more efficient it is. So,        a 50-mile range at 55 mph extends to a 100-mile range at        35 mph. Although it is seldom safe to travel this slowly        on a road, being aware that the range grows with        conservative driving is handy when you need it.      </p>      <p>        Manufacturer specifications give both a top speed and a        maximum range for their electric vehicles. A "rule of        thirds" applied to these two numbers helps give an idea        of what speed yields the best range. At top speed, the        vehicle's range is one-third of the vehicle's maximum        range. On a full battery charge, an EV with a top speed        of 75 mph and a maximum range of 120 miles will travel        about 40 miles at 75 mph; at 25 mph, its range stretches        to 120 miles.      </p>      <p>        Coasting is another mileage-stretching technique. In a        vehicle powered by an engine, removing your foot from the        accelerator pedal engages a feature called compressive        braking, which slows the vehicle and consumes fuel. The        same action in an EV without regenerative braking or with        it switched off effectively shuts down power to the        electric motor, and the EV's own momentum freely spins        the motor via the wheels and drive train. Experienced        owners use the coasting effect of an EV to great        advantage. One way is to simply bring the vehicle over        the posted speed by a few miles, then remove your foot        from the accelerator pedal. The vehicle coasts, slowed        only by tire and wind resistance. Once the speedometer        shows that the vehicle has dropped 4 mph below the        initial speed, the accelerator is pushed to bring the        vehicle back up to the initial speed. Any time the        vehicle is coasting, it is not consuming any power, which        adds many miles to the vehicle's overall range. A driver        who is attentive to traffic, stop signs and traffic        signals may allow the EV to coast down from speed to        avoid braking. To get the same effect with a car using an        engine-slipping the transmission into neutral and        shutting down the engine-is hazardous.      </p>    </div>        <p>      Ileya Stewart tests the Panasonic E-Hybrid on a steep hill      in Willits, California (at left). The electric-assist      automatically amplifies her pedal effort to easily tackle      hills that would challenge a regular-bicycle rider. Mike      Saari of Palo Alto, California, sits on an EVSkeeter, a      recumbent bicycle he built (at right). With its 800-watt      Heinzmann hub motor and battery pack, the bike can travel      30 miles on a single charge and climb hills at 15 mph. It      fully recharges on 7  cents of electricity.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Banking on Batteries      </h3>      <p>        An EV's batteries are made up of many smaller batteries        wired together to obtain the desired voltage. Think of it        this way: Amps give the motor torque and volts give it        speed. But you can't just add as many batteries as you        want to increase either-each battery is the size of a        toaster and weighs close to 70 pounds.      </p>      <p>        Deep-cycle, lead-acid batteries, used extensively in        industrial vehicles, marine applications, forklifts and        golf carts, are generally the choice battery for EVs.        They are designed to be repeatedly drawn down to a low        state of charge before being recharged and are tough        enough to survive fluctuating recharge cycles as might be        experienced when solar, wind or hydroelectric energy        sources are used. Freeway EVs may have 20 of these        batteries, while smaller EVs may use only half as many.        Deep-cycle, lead-acid batteries are affordable, widely        available in many shapes and sizes, and are backed by an        efficient recycling industry.      </p>      <p>        Sealed lead-acid (SLA) batteries are used in all small        EVs and in some larger ones. These batteries require no        maintenance, where flooded-cell types need regular        replenishment of the water lost to evaporation and        electrolysis. SLA batteries cost more than flooded types        and have a reputation of a slightly shorter life span.      </p>      <p>        A nickel-cadmium (nicad) battery yields twice as much        power and storage capacity of lead-acid batteries for the        same battery space. But because nicad batteries are        expensive, easily two to three times the price of        lead-acid batteries, and recycling these batteries is a        challenging and expensive undertaking, use of nicad        batteries is generally restricted to electric motorcycles        and electric-assist bicycles.      </p>      <p>        Quality lead-acid batteries have a 500-cycle life span,        similar to sealed-lead and nicad batteries. If an EV's        battery pack is driven within 50 percent of its capacity        an average of four days per week, it will be three years        before the battery pack needs replacement. Deeper        discharges and more frequent use will shorten the life        span to as little as two years. Some EV users, however,        report five or more years of good utility from their EV's        battery pack.      </p>    </div>        <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Go Electric      </h3>      <p>        You can convert a gasoline-engine powered car to electric        power for about half the price of a new electric vehicle.        While virtually any auto can be converted to an electric        drive, select one that had decent fuel economy as a        gas-fueled car. The lighter the car, the less energy        needed for acceleration and climbing hills, and the less        it will drain the limited amount of energy a battery pack        contains. Popular models for conversion are the Geo        Metro, Honda Civic and Volkswagon Rabbit. Cars with power        steering, air conditioning and automatic transmissions        are not good candidates. If you prefer the use of an        automatic transmission over a manual one, don't worry. A        car with a manual transmission, after conversion, may be        shifted manually or worked like an automatic.

Grocery-getting is groovy        in a little GEM (top right). In Philadelphia, NEVs are        being used as a critical component in the Clean Cities        program, which promotes the use of alternative-fuel        vehicles ( www.cleanair.org/cleancities ). Shelley        Launey, Department of Energy Clean Cities Program        Director (pictured in the middle right photo ),        demonstrates pedal power in a Kronosport Taxi.

Adding a small      motor and battery pack to a bicycle lends the energy of a      second person without the weight penalty, and works well      for cycling over level terrain, climbing grades and      reaching higher vehicle speeds than pedal-only operation      provides.    </p>    <p>      Electric-assist bicycles use four methods to integrate the      motor with the vehicle's chain-works: tire drive, chain      drive, torque-sensing and hub motor.    </p>        <p>      The ZAP system is an add-on, <strong>tiredrive</strong>      system that mounts the motor to the front or rear bicycle      forks. A thumb switch near the right handlebar engages the      motor to press a roller on the motor shaft, which helps      spin the tire. This design wears the outside of the tire      rather quickly, and necessitates more frequent tire      replacement. A sealed 12-volt, 15-amp-hour battery rests in      a canvas boot under the top rail. Tiredrive systems include      the Zeta II (front drive, $149), single-motor ($359) and      dual-motor ($449). The motor kit is integrated in the      Powerbike ($599) [(800) 251-4555; <em>www.zapworld.com      ].</em>    </p>    <p>      The Currie motor uses a separate <strong>chain      drive</strong> and sprocket mounted at the rear of the      bicycle to power the rear wheel. Currie offers the E-Police      bike, E-Tryke and E-Cruiser, E-folder and a U.S. ProDrive      motor system for adapting an existing bicycle ($450). The      bikes will travel speeds of 13 to 20 mph (depending on      model), with a 12- to 15-mile range with pedal-assist      [(800) 268-8596; www.currietech.com ].    </p>    <p>      The Panasonic E-hybrid bike powers the same chain used by      the pedals to drive the rear wheel, using a      <strong>torque-sensing</strong> feature to amplify the      pedal input. The 12volt, 4.5-amp-hour battery pack will      take a rider 20 miles on a single charge. A push-button      control box within range of a rider's thumb lets the      operator select both the electrics (on or off) and degree      of electric assistance (high or low). The box also contains      a three-LED display of the battery's state of charge during      operation. The 4.5 pound battery is easily removed for      charging, and the lightweight charger has both a quick      (two-hour) and overnight (eight-hour) charging rate. The      torque-sensing feature demands pedal input to work, so      there's simply no way to drain the battery pack too      quickly. The Panasonic provides intuitive and smooth      operation, predictable range and enough of a workout to      truly qualify as an electric assist bicycle. It sells for      $1,395.    </p>    <p>      The newest way to add electric-assist to a bicycle is to      use a motor built into the hub of the rear bicycle wheel.      The <strong>hub motor'</strong> s shaft is stationary and      the outer casing spins, turning the rim and tire to which      it is spoked. The EVSkeeter, a recumbent bike design by      Mike Saari (pictured at right), uses an 800-watt Heinzmann      hub motor, a 40-pound, 24-volt sealed lead-acid battery      pack, and Heinzmann's specialized cruise-control system. A      thumb switch activates the motor, aiding or entirely      replacing pedal input from the rider. The EVSkeeter has a      25 mph top speed, a range of 30 miles, brisk acceleration,      and is classified as a motorized bicycle, bypassing the      need for a driver's license, vehicle registration and      insurance in most states.    </p>    <p>      The hub motor is quiet and simple, has few parts, and      avoids interfering with the stock chainworks, making it      easier to maintain and service. Heinzmann retrofit motor      kits are priced from $1,100. [Both the Panasonic E-hybrid      and Heinzmann hub motor kits are available from Electric      Bikes Northwest; (206) 547-4621; www.electricvehiclesnw.com      .]    </p>    <p>      <strong>Electrified recumbent bicycles,</strong> like the      EVSkeeter Model 20 ($2,995), combine a comfortable chair      seat with the speed and range to create a practical      substitute for most car trips. Because the bike is lower to      the ground, which greatly reduces wind-drag, a rider of an      electric recumbent bike covers the same ground in about      three-quarters of the time that it takes a standard-bike      rider. [The EVSkeeter is currently only available in      California. For more information, visit www.skeeterEV.com      or call (650) 493-7633.1    </p>    <p>      Widely used in Europe, scooters and mopeds are ideal for      zipping around town. Electric scooter and mopeds avoid the      pollution, noise and reliability problems of most      gasoline-engine mopeds.    </p>    <p>      Scooters range from the <strong>Zappy Turbo,</strong> a      folding electric scooter with a range of 5 miles and top      speed of 18 mph [$399; (800) 251-4555; www.zapworld.com ],      to the mid-size <strong>EGo,</strong> which will cover more      than 20 miles at a speed of 16 to 21 mph [$1,599; (800)      979-4346; www.egovehicles.com ]. For commuters who have      farther to travel, the <strong>Voloci</strong> can travel      50 miles at speeds up to 30 mph [$2,000 to $2,500; (888)      353-4464; www.voloci.com ].    </p>    <p>      Electric motorcycles offer distinct advantages over their      gas-powered relatives. The <strong>Viento A5</strong> wraps      stylish plastic body parts around a strong sheet-metal      frame, fully enclosing its 6-horsepower Briggs E-Tec      electric motor and 12-volt, 70-amp-hour battery pack.      Licensed as a moped, the Viento A5 is speed-limited to 30      mph and has a range of 30 to 50 miles [$3,500; (310)      475-0381; www.theelectriccyclecompany.com ].    </p>    <h3>      CHARGING UP    </h3>    <p>      Recharging NEVs and longer-range EV cars is more      time-consuming than simply refilling a fuel tank; a bulk      charge rate (up to 75 percent battery capacity) takes four      hours, and a complete battery recharge takes eight to 10      hours, at 10 to 15  cents per hour. (Recharging bike and      scooter batteries takes less time.) At work, a few      solar-electric panels in the parking lot would be all you      need to recharge your EV's batteries for the evening      commute home. Most EVs plug into a standard 110-volt wall      socket for overnight charging. Larger EVs or ones with      high-voltage battery packs may require a 220-volt outlet.    </p>    <p>      Savvy EV owners add a time-of-use (TOU) meter to their home      utility meter to lower the rate for EV recharging. A TOU      meter records power usage within two distinct time periods:      peak (between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m.) and off-peak (from 7 p.m      to 11 a.m.). Most homes pay a flat rate for electricity for      a 24-hour period, but a home with a TOU meter pays two      rates: a higher one for peak use and lower one for off-peak      use.    </p>    <p>      Since most EVs are recharged overnight, TOU metering is an      ideal arrangement that significantly reduces the cost of      recharging daily. In the United States, says Paul MacCready      of Aerovironment, a company specializing in electric and      hybrid vehicle systems. 6 million EVs could be recharged      from utility electricity overnight without the construction      of a single new power plant.    </p>    <p>      The cost of installing a TOU meter ($150 to $200) pays for      itself in about a year's time. Many states now also offer      significant rebates to offset the cost of installing      grid-tied renewable energy systems. The Database of State      Incentives for Renewable Energy ( www.dsireusa.org ) lists      programs by state. Homeowners can take advantage of these      savings and use the clean electricity produced from the sun      or wind to recharge their electric vehicle.    </p>    <p>      EV charging stations are popping up throughout the country      to assist with opportunity charging. A dedicated parking      space designated with a sign, with a charging box mounted      on a pole serves this function. Both 110- and 220-volt      sockets are available. The electricity consumed is so      miniscule, most charging stations offer the service for      free. In Switzerland, EVs may pull into a streetside      parking spot, plug into the meter at the curb, and deposit      coins for parking and electricity. In California, the      Sacramento Municipal Utility District shades its parking      lot with solar-electric panels, which provide power for its      mixed fleet of EVs.    </p>    <p>      EV advocate and author Michael Hackleman has built 20 EVs,      half conversions and half prototypes. He is now working on      electric propulsion systems for ultralight rail vehicles      and airships.    </p>
