                    <h5 id="byline">      by Lynn Keiley    </h5>    <p>      Until the Industrial Revolution, nearly all breads were      made from sourdough cultures fermented by air- borne      bacteria and yeast, which create most these breads' flavor.      Bake bread in this ancient tradition, with natural,      homemade sourdough starter instead of coil , commercial      yeast, and discover rich texture and fabulous flavor.    </p>    			    <p>      Sourdough breads have been around for centuries. At some      time in human history, people figured out they could      ferment grain and use it to make bread. Perhaps, as Ed Wood      speculates in his book <em>Classic Sourdoughs: A Home      Baker's Handbook</em> (see MOTHER'S Bookshelf, Page 103),      cakes of cereal left sitting out on warm days inadvertently      collected wild yeasts. Eventually, someone baked the cake      and discovered bread; later on, people learned to use      pieces of old bread to make subsequent batches rise. It      wasn't until 1857 that Louis Pasteur discovered the secret      beasts that give bread its boost: <em>yeast.</em>    </p>    <p>      But yeast is not the only factor involved in making      sourdough bread. Although yeast is responsible for raising      the dough, bacteria, primarily lactobacilli, are an      essential part of the process. They thrive in the acidic      environment of sourdough's active yeast culture and produce      a multitude of flavors for which sourdoughs are known.    </p>    <p>      Besides the intricate workings of yeasts and bacteria, time      is the primary component that separates sourdoughs from      commercial yeast breads. It takes many hours for the wild      yeasts and bacteria in sourdoughs to do their work.    </p>    <p>      Unlike sourdough starters, which are inhabited by many      different species of wild yeast, baker's yeast is made from      a single hyperactive species that produces a uniform      product in a relatively short period of time. The two hours      required to make a loaf of fluffy white bread also do not      give bacteria adequate time to complete their job, so most      people consider the flavor far less complex and      interesting. And a cake of baker's yeast produces only a      single batch of bread, while a carefully tended sourdough      culture can conceivably be passed down through generations.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Sourdough Bread-Baking Resources    </h3>    <p>      <strong>The Baker's Catalogue</strong><br />      PO.

But it's just about      as easy to harvest local, wild yeast and make your own.      Experts disagree whether the yeasts that ferment sourdough      bread cultures originate in the grain or the air, but you      can be sure there are plenty of them available wherever you      live.    </p>    <p>      Many complicated starter recipes have been published in      books and magazines over the years, but Alan Scott,      co-author with Daniel Wing of <em>The Bread Builders:      Hearth Loaves and Masonry Ovens,</em> eschew theist all.      Scott's technique for making starter is simply to mix      together some fresh organic flour with some spring water      (avoid chlorinated water, which can kill the microorganisms      you're trying to encourage), then set the starter in a warm      place for a few days. "As long as you feed it organic,      freshly ground flour and good water, and keep it at a      steady temperature you'll develop a stable society of      microorganisms that will get along quite well," he says.    </p>    <p>      You'll need a glass jar or nonmetal mixing bowl to start      your culture. (Wash it well before you begin, so you don't      give any nondesirable bacteria a head start.) Mix 1 cup      flour with 3/4 cup water, then cover the bowl lightly with      cheesecloth and set it in a place where the temperature      will remain warm and constant. Stir the mixture      occasionally and check it in 24 to 48 hours. When you see      small bubbles beginning to form, start adding the same      amount of flour and water once a day for the next two days,      until the culture becomes very bubbly, possibly even foamy.      (If nothing happens, it's probably best to throw the whole      mix in the compost bin and begin again.)    </p>    <p>      Once the starter becomes active, the microbes will get      hungry more quickly. Remove 1 cup of the culture (discard      the remainder) and feed it 1 cup of flour and about 3/4 cup      of water every 12 hours for the next three days. By week's      end you should have a bubbly, active starter that will      become even more lively and flavorful as you use it over      the next few weeks.    </p>    <p>      You can store your starter in the refrigerator for weeks,      even months, between baking. Each time you bake, remember      to reserve a cup of the starter and feed it 1 cup of flour      and 1 cup of water. Pour this mixture into a wide-mouthed      jar, then cover loosely with a lid to permit some air      exchange. Pennsylvania baker Steve Getz allows the mixture      to rest for a couple of hours before putting it back in the      refrigerator to give the microbes a chance to work on the      fresh flour. At some point, a light brown liquid, called      <em>hooch,</em> may form on top. This is a normal      development in a healthy culture. Just stir it back into      the mixture.    </p>    <p>      PREPARING TO BAKE    </p>        <p>      Though they typically bake dozens of loaves at a time to      supply their customers at Bake Oven Farm, Steve and Karen      Getz of Pleasant Valley, Pennsylvania, have developed a      favorite two loaf recipe they use for the family and for      testing new flours. To fit your baking time around your day      job, Steve suggests refreshing your culture the evening      before you plan to bake. Remove the starter jar from the      refrigerator and pour the culture into a large, nonmetal      (like glass or ceramic) mixing bowl. Feed it 1 cup of flour      and enough water (about 3/4 cup) to create a consistency      similar to pancake batter, then cover the bowl tightly with      plastic. Let it sit overnight in a warm spot where the      temperature will remain between 75 and 80 degrees. in the      morning, your culture should have risen considerably and be      full of bubbles.    </p>    <p>      Some bakers add more flour and water, and allow the starter      to ferment several hours longer during what's called a      <em>sponge state.</em> But you can skip the sponge step and      mix your dough, Steve says, as long as you allow the dough      a long, slow rise to develop flavor.    </p>    <p>      INTO THE OVEN    </p>    <p>      The key components in achieving a crusty bread with a      lusciously soft crumb are heat and steam. These conditions      are easy to achieve in a wood-fired oven. For those with      gas or electric ovens, there's kitchen gadget that closely      simulates the climate within a wood-fired oven: La Cloche.      A simple ceramic platter with a bowl-shaped cover, La      Cloche captures the moisture inside the dough and mimics      the moist, radiant heat found in wood ovens. Steve uses one      to make his Bake Oven Farm recipe ( see recipe ) and says      the results are nearly identical to those of his commercial      wood oven. He recommends buying a sturdy pair of oven mitts      along with La Cloche because you'll need to remove the      cover to check on the bread while it's baking. ( See      sources. )    </p>    <p>      A pizza stone is another way to create the radiant heat      necessary for making a good crust, but you'll need to be a      bit more resourceful to provide the necessary moisture.      Some people use a spray bottle to mist the oven just before      putting the bread in, then mist again every five minutes      for the first 15 minutes or so. You can also lay a wet      towel inside the oven door for the first part of the baking      process, as long as you're not likely to forget about it.      (Set a timer to ring 10 minutes after you put the bread in      the oven if you need help remembering to remove the towel.)    </p>    <p>      The bread needs to bake 45 to 50 minutes in a 475-degree      oven. If you're using La Cloche, Steve suggests resisting      the urge to remove the cover for at least 30 minutes, then      checking the bread periodically after that.    </p>    <p>      Knowing exactly when bread is finished baking is somewhat      of an acquired skill, but most people rely on the thump as      their primary cue. Just press your forefinger against your      thumb and give the loaf a good thwack! If it sounds hollow,      it's ready to come out. If you're willing to put a hole      into your beautiful loaf, you can use a thermometer and      remove the loaf when its internal temperature is between      190 degrees and 210 degrees.    </p>    <p>      Irresistible as it will surely be, try to refrain from      cutting into the hot loaf as soon as you pull it from the      oven. The flavor will fully develop as the bread cools and      releases trapped carbon dioxide. Few of us, though, have      the fortitude to wait more than a few torturous minutes      before tearing into the loaf. A primal urge surrounds a      fragrant loaf of steaming bread-a familiarity Alan      has witnessed time and again. "To bite into these fermented      breads," he says, "is to experience a sort of homecoming. A      little bit of old-time comfort in the face of modern      science."    </p>    <p>      Slashing the dough    </p>    <p>      When bread dough meets high oven temperatures, it gets a      lift known as oven spring, which helps give bread a lighter      texture. Slashing the top surface of the loaf allows the      contents inside to expand, or bloom. You can buy special      tools for Slashing, or use a sharp knife or single-edge      razor blade. (Cushion the dull side with masking tape to      make it safer and easier to handle.) The way a loaf is      slashed becomes the baker's signature, so try your hand      making a unique, creative cut.<br />    </p>    <p>      Use Fresh Flour    </p>    <p>      Sure, you can make a respectable loaf of bread using a      brand-name flour found ,ray your local supermarket's      shelves, but if you're using a living culture, why not use      a freshly ground flour that will enhance its complex      flavor?    </p>    <p>      Most experts agree that a high-gluten bread flour is the      best choice for making most kinds of bread. However, bread      bakers Alan Scott and Steve Getz both agree the most      important quality for a good bread flour is its freshness.      "We've found that our cultures are much more active and the      bread rises much better when we use-freshly ground flour,"      Steve says.    </p>    <p>      Alan has discovered some important benefits from working      with flours that are ground slowly between the mill stones,      "if you grind the grain very slowly, then allow the flour      to rest between the stones for a period of time, the oils      will saturate the flour more thoroughly. What you get is a      very creamy, fragrant flour. When you put this flour into      the bread starter, it's about twice as active as other      cultures." One reason the starter works so well, Alan      theorizes, is because slow-grinding polishes the edges of      the bran. In contrast, Alan says sharp bran particles,      which punch holes in the gluten and let the gas escape,      inhibit bread-rising.    </p>    <p>      Alan works primarily with whole wheat flours, but Steve      prefers a blend of an organic unbleached flour and an      organic hard winter wheat he grinds himself. He recommends      combining equal parts of each, then experimenting with the      ratios until you find the combination you like best.      Several brands of hand grinders are available for the home      baker, but if grinding your own flour doesn't fit your      lifestyle, try to find a local mill. Good flours also are      available by mail (see Resources and many natural foods      stores offer organic flours.    </p>    <p>      Kneading & Shaping    </p>        <p>      Kneading sourdough is similar to kneading other types of      dough, except that the culture does some of the work for      you. Sourdough baker and author Alan Scott has found that,      when baking with the high temperatures in wood-fired ovens,      very little kneading is necessary. "All things are slowed      down, because of the oven and the type of bread," he says.      "We've found that we can use wet, wet doughs and they don't      need to be kneaded-just folded over every half hour      so the water can be absorbed." Capturing that moisture,      Alan says, creates a nicer texture or crumb, and allows you      to experiment with different, more flavorful kinds of      wheat, some of which don't have as much gluten as typical      bread flour. "The slacker, the moister the dough, the more      moist the finished product. It's the same thing the      factories are after with all their additives."    </p>    <p>      Those of us not fortunate enough to have high-temperature      wood-fired ovens will need to work with a drier dough. Some      people begin kneading right in the bowl, folding the dough      over on top of itself, then rolling it out onto a lightly      floured table as it becomes more manageable. Baker Steve      Getz recommends giving the dough a resting period in the      middle of the process. When the dough becomes fairly      workable, cover it lightly with a cotton towel and allow it      to rest for 30 minutes before you finish the process. "I      like to give the bread a break sooner than later, about      halfway into the kneading," he says. Then knead again. When      your dough is smooth and elastic, put it into a large,      lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and allow      it to rise, or proof, slowly in a cool place for eight to      10 hours, or until its size has doubled. If you're proofing      at higher temperatures, your dough will rise faster, so      you'll need to keep an eye on it. It's best to keep the      temperature under 75 degrees so the bacteria has plenty of      time to develop the flavor.    </p>    <p>      When the dough is ready to shape, turn it onto a lightly      floured table. Steve uses a two-stage method of shaping, in      which he builds texture, similar to making flaky pastry.      Flatten the dough into a long rectangle about 1 inch thick,      separating it into two loaves. Fold each piece into thirds      lengthwise, folding one side over the other. Then fold the      ends over each other, pressing lightly on the center with      your fist to hold everything in place.    </p>    <p>      Next, take your squarish piece of dough and shape it      lightly around the edges to form a ball, or boule. Let it      rest for about 15 minutes, then turn it over and flatten      it. Repeat the shaping process, but this time, put your      boule into a bowl or basket lined with a well-floured      cotton towel or piece of linen. Allow the dough to rise      about 45 minutes or until its size has almost doubled.    </p>    <p>      Bake Oven Farm Sourdough    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups starter</em> <em>6 cups organic flour (Try a      mixture of 50 percent unbleached and 50 percent whole wheat      flour, or adjust the proportions to your taste.)</em> <em>2      1/2 cups spring water</em> <em>1 tablespoon salt</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. In a      separate bowl, dilute the starter with the water. Slowly      mix the starter into the flour. (Steve prefers to use his      hands, but the more fastidious among us may prefer to use a      wooden spoon.) Begin kneading and slowly work the flour      into the dough. Just as the dough becomes workable, stop      and allow it to rest for about 30 minutes. Resume kneading      until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.    </p>    <p>      Shape it into a ball and put it into a lightly oiled bowl,      then cover it with plastic and allow it to rise in a cool      place (about 62 degrees) for eight to 10 hours. Shape the      dough twice (see " Kneading and Shaping ," Page 68) and      allow it to rise about 45 minutes, or until it doubles. If      you're using La Cloche (see " Resources ," Page 65 for      ordering information) or a baking stone, now's the time to      preheat it and the oven. Slash the loaves just before you      put them in the oven. (See " Slashing the Dough ") Bake at      475 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes or until the bread sounds      hollow when you thump it with your finger.    </p>    <p>      Lynn Keiley gardens, cooks and writes in Pennsylvania.
