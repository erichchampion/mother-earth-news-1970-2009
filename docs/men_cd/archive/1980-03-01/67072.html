        <p>When I told the harbormaster that I wanted to buy the battered skiff that was resting <strong>-</strong> half buried in drifted sand <strong>-</strong> down by the pier, he looked at me with the pity an expert bestows on one who suffers from the affliction of ignorance.</p><p>"Buy it, be damned! " he exclaimed. "Just get it out of here, and it's yours!."</p><p>The captain was obviously delighted to be rid of the old derelict . . . and must have thought I was a fool to want a boat that would require gallons of caulk and months of work before it would float again.</p><p>He had no idea that an hour later the dilapidated vessel would be transformed into an attractive new planter nestled cozily in the corner of my front patio . . . or that <strong>-</strong> by the following autumn <strong>-</strong> I would be harvesting a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes, beets, and carrots from the recycled wreck.</p><p><strong>SHIPS FOR SMALL SPACES</strong></p><p>Whether your growing space is limited or not, using a discarded boat as a flower/vegetable bed offers several advantages: The plants' environment can be easily controlled . . . the unique planter can actually beautify your yard . . . and finally, such a recycled skiff allows one more piece of "junk" to find a useful existence.</p><p>But think before you plant! Make sure your dinghy is placed in the best possible position <em>before you</em> fill it full of soil. (It may sound as if I'd learned that bit of wisdom from sad experience, but I was lucky enough to pick a good spot for my boat-garden <em>without</em> giving the matter too much thought.)</p><p>Flat-bottomed skiffs are the easiest to deal with, of Course, as they don't require the supporting structures necessary to hold round or V-bottom barks upright. With the latter types, you must plan even more carefully: When the boat is already loaded down with dirt, you won't want to discover that your supports are insufficiently sturdy.</p><p><strong>A YACHT-GARDEN TECHNIQUE</strong></p><p>Each "small craft gardener" will no doubt develop a favorite recipe to produce the best conditions in his or her boat, but my "record" of two <em>great</em> growing seasons makes me confident enough to recommend my own "mix".</p><p>Fist-sized stones were first placed in the boat's bottom . . . to a depth of about one foot. The rocks were followed by a few inches of sand, a layer of manure (also several inches thick), and <strong>-</strong> finally <strong>-</strong> a layer of good topsoil. Some space (about four to six inches) was left between the top of the dirt and the gunwale of the boat . . . to prevent earth loss from wind and watering, <em>and</em> to allow sufficient room to add mulch.</p><p>I've found that the roots of plants in such a bed actually penetrate the sand and anchor themselves among the rocks. Then nutrients from the manure and mulches drain down easily to be absorbed by the vegetables or flowers. I was especially pleased that root crops, such as carrots (which had previously had a difficult time in my heavy soil), grew large and straight.</p><p>So the next time you see a small, shipwrecked craft that will never go to sea (or to the lake or river) again, you'll know what to do with it. Not only can you give a sad skiff a new purpose in life . . . but you'll be rewarded with a pretty planter overflowing with flowers and/or food.</p>
