        <p>"A cordwood-geodesic-dome-solar-greenhouse? That's what we're building?!!"</p><p>A lot of people attended MOTHER's Summer of 1979 seminars held at our ever improving Ecological Research Center . . . and a good number of those visitors were bighearted enough to chip in on a very unusual building project, a project that just sort of <em>happened</em> to happen!</p><p>It all started when Jack Henstridge -the self-educated stackwood construction expert who was teaching his lowcost building technique as part of MOTHER's Earth-Sheltered Homes seminar decided to offer our students a chance to "get their hands dirty". So Jack found an open spot and-along with his pupils began splitting log rounds . . . mixing sand, lime, water, and cement . . . and building one of the billet-and-mortar structures known as a stackwood wall.</p><p>Before long, a whole <em>lot</em> of seminar folks got stricken with the legendary "Tom Sawyer fence painting" syndrome and pitched right in on the project. All of a sudden, Jack Henstridge found himself in the midst of an on-the-spot stackwall construction <em>movement.</em> A lot of go-get-'em volunteer workers were sawing and splitting and stacking and slapping cement and sweating up a storm and having a fine of barn-raising-type good time building the gracefully curved structure . . . the only question was, what in blue blazes were all these good-natured people actually constructing?</p><p>Well, the half-dome of cordwood has been finished since then, and MOTHER researcher Emerson Smyers has come up with his own innovative way of constructing a <em>translucent</em> geodesic half do me to match it. Emerson has <em>also</em> figured out how to <em>attach</em> the glass-triangled structure to the already completed, south-facing stackwood-and-cement creation . . . and the result will be a geodesic-dome fronted, wood-wall-backed solar greenhouse!</p><p>As this article is being written, our EcoVillage staffers are putting the finishing touches on the "two-tone" dome. And in the next issue of this magazine we hope to be able to show you one of the most down-home stylish (and unique) hothouses ever constructed!</p><p>Still, nobody around these parts has forgotten that the whole masterpiece never would have come to be at all, had it not been for our unstoppable seminar visitors . . . who just couldn't resist the chance to get themselves a few splinters, and scratched-up hands, and stinging blisters, <em>and</em> sore back muscles by chipping in on Jack Henstridge's demonstration project. So to all those helpful folks -whoever you are and wherever you may now be-who had the <em>biggest</em> part in making this "geodesic cordwood greenhouse" a reality, MOTHER says, "Keep on stacking" . . . "May your woodlot always be full" . . . and "Thanks! "</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE': You can learn about Jack Henstridge's stackwood home building success by reading his article, "We Built a $75,000 House</em>. . . for <em>Only $10,000!" in MOTHER NO. 45, page 96 (available for $3.00-plus $1.00 shipping and handling-from THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>Â°, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina, 98739). Two construction guides to the inexpensive building method are Jack's own</em> Building the Cordwood Home ($6.00) <em>and the Northern Housing Committee of the University of Manitoba's</em> Stackwall: How to Build It <em>($12.00). Both books are are available for their list prices plus 950 shipping and handling-from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739.</em></p><p><em>And, for information about this</em> coming <em>summer's seminar program, turn to page 180 of this publication.</em></p>
