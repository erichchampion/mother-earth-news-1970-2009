        <p>By spending a little time in the workshop, you can beautify your yard, provide yourself with a wonderful source of entertainment for years to come, <em>and</em> cut down on the number of garden (and people) attacking pests that'll be around your place this spring and summer! All you have to do is whip up a few homegrown bird feeders and baths.</p><p>To build the little eatery shown in the accompanying photograph, just locate a dried gourd (if you don't have any left over from your own harvest, check with your neighbors or gardening friends). Then use a fine-toothed saw to cut a "bird-sized" opening, remove the seeds, and drill two holes - on opposite sides of the top - to accommodate the hooked ends of a V-shaped piece of coat hanger.</p><p><br />The bird bath (which you probably won't put out till warmer weather . . . as a late freeze could turn it into a miniature skating rink) is made from a circular gourd. Simply cut across the vegetable to form a dish, drill four holes at equidistant points around the upper edge, and make two coat hanger "V"s - each of which will be hooked into one pair of holes - to use when suspending the bath from a handy tree limb.</p><p>One caution, though: It's been speculated that - especially during the winter, when food is hard to come by - feeder-fed birds might well starve if their supply happened to be cut off during inclement weather. If you start hosting your backyard feathered friends now, be sure to <em>keep</em> the feeder stocked. After all, a little regular attention is a small price to pay for the help and pleasure that the colorful bathers and diners will give to you in return!</p>
