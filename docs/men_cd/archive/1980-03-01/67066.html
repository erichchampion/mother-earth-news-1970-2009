                    <p>      Randy Kidd reports on "miniature" cattle:<br />    </p>        <p>      Suppose someone could "invent" the perfect cow for      homesteaders . . . what would the bovine beauty be like?      Well, the animal would probably be an economical, small      beast that required about half the grazing land of an      ordinary cow or steer . . . yet still gave a fine yield of      both milk <em>and</em> beef, right? Not only that (as long      as we're fantasizing, we might as well go all the way!),      but the critter would be so docile and friendly that it      could be a domestic pet as well as a livestock animal!    </p>    <p>      Well, amazingly enough, such a small-is-beautiful breed of      cattle actually exists! These "dream beasts" are called      Irish Dexters (they were developed-years ago-by      frugal Gaelic folk who wanted to get a lot of milk and meat      but owned only small plots of land), and they really and      truly <em>do</em> possess all the "invented" virtues listed      above.    </p>    <p>      So if you're a small-scale farmsteader, Dexter cattle could      quite possibly be the perfect livestock for you to raise.      BUT (isn't there always a "but"?) <em>before you</em> try      to build up a herd of the pint-sized bossies, you should      take a close look at both the "pluses" and "minuses" of the      Emerald Isle imports.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE GOOD NEWS<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Irish Dexters are, indeed, much smaller (and therefore more      "homestead sized") than our common cattle breeds. A mature      cow of this unique line averages around 600-800 pounds, and      an adult bull weighs in at between 800 and 1,000 pounds      (which makes the beast a heck of a lot lighter animal than      the average-sized 2,000-pound Brahman steer!). The      waist-high ruminants are stocky and very short-legged      (especially below the knees) critters. In fact, they      resemble heavy-shouldered Black Angus cattle, but they're      built so low to the ground that you almost wonder if their      briskets will drag!    </p>    <p>      Dexter cattle are also "easy keepers": They're relatively      weather-hardy beasts and require much less land and grain      than do larger bovine breeds. During the grazing season, a      cow and her calf can eat heartily on a couple of acres of      good pasture . . . and an adult Dexter's daily wintertime      ration need be only a bale-or at most a bale and a      half-of hay along with a pound of grain.    </p>    <p>      Just as important as the breed's economical eating habits      is the fact that the dual-purpose animals do a good job of      producing both meat <em>and</em> milk. An 18-month-old      steer will dress out to a good 250-500 pounds of tasty      beef, and a cow may yield 400-600 gallons of milk a year.      (The fresh liquid contains a high-5%, or      more-butterfat content, but tends to be "naturally      homogenized" like goat's milk, so you'll need either a      separator or some patience if you want to produce cream.)    </p>    <p>      Dexters are also extremely easy to work with. The low-slung      cud-chewers have such gentle dispositions that some owners      let their children caretake 'em . . . others find that a      few strands of barbed wire fencing are enough to contain      the placid critters . . . and lots of Dexter ranchers think      of their animals as bovine companions!    </p>    <p>      You'd naturally assume that such positive traits would make      Dexter cattle just about <em>the</em> breed for small      landholders. And sure enough, most everyone who raises the      animals is absolutely delighted with the      petite-but-productive beasts. So why, then, haven't Dexters      become farmstead regulars? Why don't you see the critters      all <em>over</em> our nation's pastures? The reason, of      course, is that along with all the good news about the      hardy cows, there is also some <em>bad</em> news.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      The most "infamous" drawback of the Irish Dexter is the      breed's genetic "bulldog trait". This birth defect      <em>(chondrodystrophia fetalis) is</em> fatal to any fetus      that inherits it. The mother is not affected, but her      unborn calf-which has a bulldoglike pushed-in nose      and extremely short legs-is spontaneously aborted      sometime between the second and eighth months of pregnancy.    </p>    <p>      The inherited trait is carried by a recessive gene, so      while only a moderate percentage of Dexter calves are      "bulldogs", the <em>potential</em> for the defect is often      handed down by seemingly healthy specimens.    </p>    <p>      In theory, one quarter of Dexter offspring bred from      parents who carry the trait should not survive.      Fortunately, some other-and not yet completely      understood-genetic factors modify the occurrence of      this calamity so that, in real life, <em>less</em> than one      quarter of the offspring are bulldogs. (Incidentally, other      cattle can be afflicted with <em>chondrodystrophia fetalis      . . . so never</em> risk spreading the bulldog trait by      mating a Dexter with an animal of another breed.)    </p>    <p>      The first piece of bad news, then, for potential Dexter      caretakers is that such farmers will lose a percentage      (probably around 5-10%, but <em>conceivably</em> closer to      25%) of their calf crop. Established Dexter owners, though,      don't find this part of "doing business" with the breed to      be a prohibitive drawback.    </p>    <p>      Prospective "mini-cow" raisers will have to face one      more-quite serious-problem, however: scarcity.      There are only 500 or 600 Irish Dexters in the entire      United States, so it <em>can</em> be danged hard to find an      animal that's up for sale. Folks sometimes have to search      for <em>years</em> to locate an owner who's willing to part      with even one healthy, productive cow.    </p>    <p>      You can learn the whereabouts of Irish Dexters in the U.S.      by contacting either the American Dexter Cattle      Association, 707 West Water Street, Decorah, Iowa 52101 . .      . or James Johnson (the organization's president), 4092      Broadview Road, Richfield, Ohio 44286. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:      Be sure to send a couple of dollars along with any requests      for information, to help compensate these folks for their      mailing expenses and completely voluntary assistance.]</em>      But be patient while you're waiting for a reply. The Dexter      Association people have-at times in the      past-been deluged with information requests. They      eventually (and kindly) answer all their mail . . . but      they might understandably not "cotton to" insistent queries      from people who are <em>too</em> anxious.    </p>    <p>      So if you want to raise Irish Dexters, you first have to      accept the fact that it will take time-and      persistence-to discover a source of the economical      animals. On the other hand, though, folks who eventually      <em>do</em> get these "dream" farmstead livestock most      often find that the rewards are worth the wait.    </p>
