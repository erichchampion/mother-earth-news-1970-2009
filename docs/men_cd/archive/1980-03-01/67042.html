        <p>Marlin and Eva Huffman</p><p>A 20-acre feline fantasy turns afine profit for these two Florida farmers!</p><p>Most people are well aware of the factthat cats are fascinated by catnip. It seems the little animalscan't resist the lure of <em>Nepeta cataria's</em> essentialoils, which are said to be similar in scent to the chemicals afemale feline gives off during her mating period.</p><p> Lesser known,however, is the fact that the plant's dried leaves and flowersmake a tasty herb tea, and-when brewed a bit stronger-thebeverage becomes a potent medicinal concoction for the treatmentof common colds, menstrual pains, baby colic, flatulence, flu,tension headaches, nervousness, and insomnia.</p><p> On our Floridafarm, we grow the attractive herb for <em>all</em> those reasons,but-primarily-our catnip patch is a 20-acre cash crop . . . thatadds thousands of dollars to our income!</p><p><strong>CULTIVATECONTENTMENT</strong></p><p> Catnip was first brought to this country byearly colonists as an essential component of their medicinalgardens. But, before long, the hardy plants escaped and soon grewwild over much of the United States.</p><p> It should be obvious-fromthe versatile herb's ability to thrive on its own that catnip<em>can</em> be a sure-fire crop . . . once you understand itsneeds. Full sunshine is a must for the plant, and good drainageis equally important. Happily -since catnip's shallow, long,fibrous roots thrive in poor, dry, sandy soil you'll hardly everneed to water your crop once it's established. Additionally,catnip cultivators don't have to worry about bugs or worms,because such pests -along with goats, chickens, and rats dislikethe leaves' strong oils.</p><p> As far as soil preparation goes, we'vefound that even a very <em>little</em> chemical fertilizer can<em>destroy</em> the herb, and raw, uncomposted manure will killthe plants, too. We use approximately one teaspoon of 50% organic6-6-6 per plant in the early spring and, again, in July. Andalthough the addition of a little agricultural lime to the earthis usually advantageous, a 5.8-6.5 pH range is satisfactory.</p><p><strong>TO GET GOING</strong> To start a catnip crop, purchaseseed from an herb dealer or buy small plants from a mail ordernursery. Here are some sources (which will supply catalogs onrequest)</p><p>George Park Seed Company<br />Dept. TMEN<br />Greenwood, South Carolina 29647</p><p>Burpee Seed Company<br />Dept. TMEN<br />Warminster, Pennsylvania 18991</p><p>Shades of Green<br />Dept. TMEN<br />Box 57 Ipswich, Massachusetts 01938 Johnny's Selected Seeds<br />Dept. TMEN<br />Albion, Maine 04910<br />(Send $1.00 and an SASE for information.)</p><p> In the fall or earlyspring, work the ground well, making sure you destroy and rakeout any perennial weeds and grasses. Then sow the seeds (whichgerminate poorly) on top of the soil at a ratio of about 10 persquare foot. When that's done, pack the tiny kernels into theearth with a roller (or tramp them with your feet) . . . and keepthe area moist for about 15 days.</p><p> Once the seedlings are 4 to 5inches high, thin them out to one plant per two square feet ...and <em>reset</em> your extra seedlings, as they transplant well.(You can space any purchased plants in the same manner.)</p><p><strong>HOW TO HARVEST</strong> By late July or early August-whenabout 25% of the blooms have turned brown-your crop will be readyto harvest. Perform the task early in the morning, just after thedew is gone, by snipping the herbs off at a point about fiveinches above the ground (if you cut the stems any closer to theirbases, the plants may not resprout). Then tie the foliage-at thecut end into convenient, uniform bunches . . . and hang the tabbytreats in a dark, very dry area.</p><p> <strong>CASH FOR CATNIP</strong>Though the market for catnip is somewhat limited, there<em>are</em> buyers eager for your crop. Check with your localherb dealer to find out if he/she stocks the feline enticer. (Ifthere are no such outlets in your area, try Wilcox Drug Company,Dept. TMEN; Box 391, Boone, North Carolina 28607. You'll findthat dried catnip can be shipped-very easily and inexpensively byUnited Parcel or any one of a number of truck lines.)</p><p> Most herbdealers will pay from 30d to 40d per pound for good-qualitycatnip (which must be fully dry and free of weeds), and aquarter-acre plot can reasonably be expected to yield 800-900pounds of the dried material per year. (Last year, we cut about80,000 dry pounds of the herb from our 20 acres.)</p><p> <strong>HOMEENJOYMENT</strong></p><p> Aside from the cash benefits that can be hadby "going commercial" with a catnip-raising operation, you'llfind that even a small patch of the herb will be a pleasantaddition to your life. To enjoy the plant in an herb tea, mixcatnip-at a ratio of one to three-with mint. You'll appreciatethe pleasing, subtle flavor <em>Nepeta cataria</em> adds.</p><p> Then,besides offering your cat its favorite weed "straight up", anoccasional sprinkle of powdered catnip can be used to attract theanimal to sleep or play in a given area.</p><p> Or, if you'd like tomake a special tabby toy, you can create a catnip mouse. Justtake a six-inch circle of cloth, fold it in half inside out, sewall but 1/2 inch of the unfolded side shut, and reverse it again.To give the toy stability, just insert a piece of narrow,oval-shaped cardboard (the "bottom" of the rodent) opposite theseam . . . stuff the pouch full of dried catnip . . . and sew orglue the hole closed.</p><p> When the mouse is finished, toss it to yourpet and stand back . . . as the action that'll follow is likelyto get thick!</p>
