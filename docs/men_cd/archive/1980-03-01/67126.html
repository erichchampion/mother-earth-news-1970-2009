        <p><br />-BRAXTON EIKENBERRY-</p><p>A grubber is a very useful - and seemingly forgotten - farmstead implement . . . with a double-ended head that's shaped like a pick on one tip and looks like an elongated adze on the other.</p><p>I've used my grub hoe to dig rows for planting seeds, potatoes, and the like . . . and to remove rocks, old tree stumps, half-buried fences, and whatever else gets in the way. In fact, I've even known folks to use a grubber to open cans of motor oil (though that <em>task</em> requires a delicate touch).</p><p>If you can't find a grub hoe in your local hardware store, don't despair. There are a few outfits that still stock 'em. The Cumberland General Store in Tennessee, for instance, has a great "dream book" of a catalog, which lists grub hoes along with a lot of other useful items. (For a copy of the book, send $3.00 - along with your name and address - to Cumberland General Store, Dept. TMEN, Route 3, Crossville, Tennessee 38555.)</p><p>However, if you want to save money, you can probably locate a <em>second-hand</em> tool. I bought mine - for $3.00 - from an antique store . . . and pocketed a $7.00 saving over the average $10 price tag for a new implement. I've seen other grubbers (some in excellent condition) be auctioned off for even less than I spent, too!</p><p>All in all, the grubber is a darn handy tool ... I'd sure hate to do without mine!</p>
