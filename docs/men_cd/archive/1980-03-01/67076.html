        <p><strong>The National Association for Gardening has the perfectsolution for "would be" urban and suburban vegetablegrowers:</strong></p><p>When the winter's snow has melted back to a few gritty graypiles on the street corner and the first crocuses show brightgreen in front of the porch, a lot of folks turn their thoughtstoward putting in a garden. Unfortunately, many people who'd loveto raise their own vegetables are-because of a lack ofavailable growing space-unable to do so.</p><p>However, over one <em>million</em> Americans have alreadysolved the exact same problem ... by forming community gardens!Such groups of vegetable raisers simply share adjacent growingplots on otherwise unused public or private land, and the cropcoalitions often obtain their "growing privileges" for free!</p><p>You can found a community garden where you live, too. All ittakes is a bit of organizational know-how and some enthusiasm. Ofcourse, it'll be up to you (or to someone you know) to providethe "sparkplugging" energy for such a project ... but a groupcalled the National Association for Gardening can readily supplyall the "how to do it" information you'll ever need.</p><p>The dedicated organization has helped <em>dozens of</em>successful community growers from Boston to San Jose. And the NAGfolks-who know scads of useful "inside tips" and "pitfallsto avoid"-have freely offered to share their hard-earnedknowledge with MOTH ER's readers.</p><p><strong>THE COORDINATOR</strong> <strong>IS THECORNERSTONE</strong></p><p>According to the "vegetable veterans" at the NationalAssociation of Gardening, successful community gardens are mostoften created by one livewire person. So the first step instarting your own group growing project is to find-orbecomesomeone who understands gardening, has the get-up-and-go todo the necessary groundwork, <em>and</em> possesses thededication to see the project through. Remember, though, that anycoordinator will need the volunteer assistance of some reliablestaffers.</p><p><strong>FIND THE LAND</strong></p><p>Locating a piece of real estate on which to establish yourgardens will likely be a matter of keeping your eyes open. Vacantlots, church or school property, factory yards, cemeteries,industrial parks, apartment grounds, utility right-of-way land,unused farmland, and corners of public parks should all be lookedupon as potential crop-raising territory. Just scout around:You'll be surprised how easy it is to find available "vegetableheavens".</p><p>And-because your group's activities will actuallyimprove the ground's appearance and fertility-you may beable to use the land for free. Be sure, though, to mar shal yourpersuasive arguments and supporters <em>before you</em> give yoursales pitch to any prospective land donor. Also, make certainthat you'll be allowed to use the area for a long enough time (atleast two seasons) to make your efforts worthwhile.</p><p><strong>PLAN AHEAD</strong></p><p>You will, of course, need to work out the physical details andmembership rules for your community garden before you hold a"sign up day" for growing plots. For instance, you shouldpredetermine the size of an individual garden (NAG recommends 25'X 30' vegetable patches, because forty such plots-plusaccess walkways-will fit in a one-acre tract, and each ofthe moderate-sized gardens can provide a family of four'svegetables for most of the year). You'll have to arrange for awater supply, too (check with the local fire department) anddecide whether to provide tools-which may be donated by acommunity-minded sponsor-and an on-site toolshed.</p><p>Your members should be told-in advance-about anyfees that have been decided upon, what the consequences forneglecting their plots would be (usually the loss of growingprivileges), whether organic and nonorganic growers will beseparated, and where seeds and gardening information can beobtained.</p><p><strong>DON'T FORGET TO PUBLICIZE</strong></p><p>Many established community gardens have membership waitinglists, but-while you are getting "squaredaway"-you'll probably need to do some active recruiting. Sotype up an attention-getting press release that contains all the"wh o", "what", "when", "where", "why", and "how" informationconcerning your project. Disseminate the flyer to local radiostations, community groups, and the person on your town'snewspaper staff who writes gardening news.</p><p>You can also start the following season's public relationseffort during harvest time ... by holding-andpublicizing-a homegrown banquet, a community food contest,a curbside "garden market", or even a charity giveaway of surplusgoodies.</p><p><strong>DO IT. . . YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID</strong></p><p>There's a lot more "groundwork" to starting a successfulcommunity garden than just preparing some soil for springplanting, but it is, indeed, possible for <em>almost anyone toorganize a successful crop-growing group. What's more, the effortwill probably make you several new friends . . . and enable apassel of people to eat</em> - <em>and live</em> -<em>a whole lot better!</em></p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The National Association for Gardening haspublished both a 38-page paperback book, Guide to CommunityGarden Organization, and a project coordinator's job descriptionand timetable.
