            		          <p>        Once in a while you hit it lucky and meet someone like        Yukon Pete.      </p>        <p>      Pete was born in Dawson half a century plus ten or fifteen      years ago, and grew up on a wilderness farm where the      family had a milk cow, raised their own pork, planted a big      garden, and lived off the land. And, of course, they made      good use of the north country's plentiful wild game . . .      fresh, canned, smoked, and preserved as pemmican.    </p>    <p>      It's been fifty years since Pete ate his mother's pemmican,      but he remembers it as if it were yesterday . . . and      here's the recipe.    </p>    <h3>      YUKON PETE'S PEMMICAN    </h3>    <p>      One-third lean bear meat<br />      One-third lean moose meat<br />      One-third lean pork scraps<br />      Salt, pepper, sage<br />      Berries<br />      Bear grease    </p>    <p>      To paraphrase another celebrated recipe, "First catch your      bear." Lucky hunters might substitute other wild      meats-venison or elk, maybe-for those listed      above, to add the true pemmican flavor that only game can      give. Us tenderfeet, though, may have to imitate the      mountain men of the old West, accept the fact that "meat's      meat", and use what we can get. Now about beef, pork, and      mutton? <em>(Pete's recipe is somewhat unusual in that it      calls</em> for <em>fresh meat. More often, pemmican</em>      <em>was made</em> <em>from</em>      <em>jerky.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Whatever makings you decide on, grind them with the medium      blade of your, food chopper, mix 'em well, and season with      salt and pepper (and, occasionally, sage for a change of      pace). Then cook the whole shebang together with very      little water-just enough to steam rather than boil      the pan's contents-until the meats are done. Toward      the end of the process, remove the lid from the kettle to      let the moisture evaporate while retaining the rich juices.    </p>    <p>      How much fruit you'll want to add to your pemmican is a      matter of taste. Personally, I'd keep the amount down to      not more than a quarter of the mixture . . . but suit      yourself.    </p>    <p>      The kind of fruit you add is also up to you. Pete's mother      made pemmican in late fall, when the hogs were slaughtered,      and spiced her mix with the cranberries she'd put up in      jars earlier. If you, too, choose canned berries, stir them      in when the meat is almost done.    </p>    <p>      Fresh fruit is also suitable for pemmican-making. I like      the idea of using serviceberries and chokecherries, as the      Indians did here in Idaho (but chokecherries, let me tell      you, are a curse to pit). Any such freshly picked      ingredients must be added earlier than canned berries to      allow thorough cooking.    </p>    <p>      For the next step you'll need a white cloth bag about the      diameter of a saucer. I sew mine from worn sheeting,      because new material doesn't allow surplus grease to seep      out. And I make a point of boiling the sack just before use      (I like to know that the fabric is sterile, and wet cloth      packs more easily in any case).    </p>    <p>      Fill the sack with the steaming mixture of meat and      berries, and have grease hot and ready to pour over the      contents. My Yukon friend tells me that his mother used a      big dipper to ladle out melted bear fat . . . about a quart      for 20 pounds of meat. No real substitute exists, he      claims, but adds that-since "there ain't no bear      grease"-I'd better stick to good pure lard and "stay      away from all that vegetable oil and shortening".    </p>    <p>      If you take Pete's advice, remember that lard will foam      when heated and should be melted in a large container. Pour      it into the sack at once, so that the hot fat will seep      down and mingle with the hot meat mixture. (This is one      reason why all cuts used must be lean.)    </p>    <p>      Another purpose of the added lard is to coat the sack and      make a tight casing which preserves the contents very      effectively. "Keep pemmican cold and it's good for ten      years," says Yukon Pete. I store small batches in the      refrigerator for short-term use, and wrap and freeze the      rest.    </p>    <p>      Using pemmican is an art in itself. The old northerner said      that when he was a kid he used to cut a couple of thick      slices, wrap them in newspaper, and stick the package in      his pocket. Then he'd snowshoe or drive his dog team to      school. At lunchtime, out came the pemmican-still      frozen-and he'd lay the slices on top of the old wood      heater to fry. "It's a rich food and really sticks with      you," he told me.    </p>    <p>      Pete <em>could</em> have eaten his pemmican cold-the      ingredients, remember, are precooked-and you've no      doubt heard stories about old-timers wolfing down the food      straight from the bag. Nevertheless, the mixture is too      greasy to be at its best in that form. You'll like it much      better heated . . . preferably by light frying.    </p>    <p>      Pemmican is a fine breakfast meat when served with hash      browns and eggs, sourdough hotcakes, or buttermilk biscuits      as its sidekicks. Or you might take a hint from Pete and      make a real Yukon feast by simmering a hefty chunk of the      preserved meat with carrots, potatoes, and onions (as you'd      cook a New England boiled dinner). It'll stick to your ribs      . . . and boy, is it good!    </p>
