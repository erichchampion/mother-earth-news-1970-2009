                <p>      Remember when we first mentioned Wind <em>Power Digest</em>      back in MOTHER NO. 32's "Special Windplant Section"?      Remember how we noted that WPD's first (and only; at that      time) issue contained a veritable wealth of useful      information for the serious wind energy enthusiast . . .      but that, without more help and support; we feared there      might never be an Issue No. 2?    </p>    <p>      Well, we're glad to say a lot of folks responded to that      notice, and thanks largely to them-and their dollars      (which is what all struggling infant publications need the      most) <em>-Wind Power Digest</em> lives on. Issue No.      2 was published this summer, and it's every bit as good as      No. 1.    </p>    <p>      In fact, <em>WPD No. 2</em> features photos and evaluations      of Comet, Zephyr 7.5 kw, Salter Rte-7000, and Amerenalt I      windplants . . . a look at Aero Power's new component      blades . . . a review of H.F. McColly and Foster Buck's old      1935 six-volt homebuilt generator plans . . . a special      reprint of a 1910 how-to article (complete with      schematics!) for building your own old-fashioned      water-pumping mills : . . an interview with North Wind      Power Company's Don Mayer . . . reports from various groups      and individuals researching wind power and its potential .      . . plans for a working Dutch windmill replica . . . reader      letters offering help, knowledge, equipment, and ideas . .      . and (whew!) just too many other features to adequately      mention here.    </p>    <p>      So c'mon, folks: Now we're <em>doubly sure Wind Power</em>      <em>Digest</em> is a valuable and outstanding source of      wind energy news and know-how. It deserves your support.      You can still buy issue Nos. 1 and 2 for $2.00 each, or get      'em both plus the next two numbers-yep, WPD's      publishing more or less regularly nowfor a mere six bucks.      Send your mosey and encouragements to Mike Evans, Editor,      <em>Wind Power Digest, 54468 CR 31,</em> Bristol, Ind.      46507.    </p>
