                  <p>      One of the world's most effective environmental groups is      San Francisco-based FRIENDS OF THE EARTH. Although FOE      publishes <em>Not</em> <em>Man Apart</em> -a      twice-a-month tabloid magazine packed with authenticated,      hard-to-find facts that every concerned citizen      needs-far too few of MOTHER's readers regularly see a      copy of <em>NMA. We</em> are therefore quite pleased that      FOE's staff has agreed to write a regular FRIENDS OF THE      EARTH column for THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.    </p>    <h3>INORGANIC VS. ORGANIC FARMING</h3>    <p>      MOTHER's readers have known it all along . . . and a recent      hard-to-ignore study of sixteen organic and sixteen      inorganic farms in the Corn Belt has now confirmed those      beliefs: Organic farming can produce better food, at less      expense, and with less adverse impact on the planet than      highly mechanized, energy-intensive "agribiz" techniques.    </p>    <p>      The study, by Dr. Barry Commoner, was undertaken when the      prices of fertilizer tripled last year in the wake of the      Arab oil embargo. Commoner found that while "natural" farms      produced 8 percent less food per acre than their mechanized      counterparts, they also spent far fewer dollars to raise      their crops than it cost the agribiz farms to raise theirs.      Net result: more profit for the organic farmers at less      expense to the land they tilled.    </p>    <h3>LEGAL BEAGLES</h3>    <p>      Environmental lawyers have scored some big victories since      our last report to MOTHER, and the Sierra Club Legal      Defense Fund had a hand in all of them:    </p>    <p>      Slow growth advocates won a smashing decision when an      ordinance limiting the growth of the town of Petaluma,      California was judged constitutional by a federal appeals      court in San Francisco.    </p>    <p>      Petaluma (site of the world arm-wrestling championship and      home of a large percentage of California's chickens) found      itself growing in all directions, at a pace that threatened      to overwhelm the surrounding countryside as well as the      town's schools, water system, and other facilities. So      Petaluma did something about the situation: The mayor and      city council drew up an ordinance limiting the growth of      housing developments, and Petaluma's voters endorsed the      measure by a 10 to 1 margin.    </p>    <p>      But the developers, knowing what was "best" for the town      (or were they thinking only of their own pocketbooks'!),      dragged Petaluma into federal court. The resulting decision      sided with the developers and against the ordinance.      Petaluma however, appealed that decision, Justice Douglas      (God bless his soul) intervened on behalf of the town, and      a higher court's panel of three judges voted unanimously to      overturn the previous ruling.    </p>    <p>      The case now may well be taken to the Supreme Court, where      there's no telling what might happen. In the meantime,      though, the burgeoning movement to curb urban and suburban      growth has a respectable judicial opinion in its pocket      with which to counter developers and their work.    </p>    <p>      Redwood National Park just may survive now, thanks again to      the Sierra Club's legal eagles. The park is threatened with      massive erosion and siltation caused by commercial logging      on slopes above RNP. (Timber companies have shown their      "public spirit" by cutting trees right up to the park's      boundaries. Legislation to expand Redwood National Park is      alive in Washington, and the loggers apparently want to      "get their licks in" before such a decision is made.) The      courts, though, have recently ordered the Interior      Department to take steps to protect the park, even if it      means going to Congress for money to buy up more land.    </p>    <p>      One other legal/forestry item: Clear-cutting now appears to      be officially illegal . . . but don't be surprised if the      Forest Service doesn't see it that way.    </p>    <p>      The Organic Act of 1$97 says that the Forest Service can      sell (for cutting) "dead, mature, or large growth trees".      Lawyers for the Sierra Club, Izaac Walton League, and West      Virginia Highlands Conservancy-however--contend that      clearcutt.ing involves a hell of a lot more trees than that      . . . and suggest the practice therefore violates the      Organic Act. The organizations filed suit challenging      several such sales of timber in West Virginia's Monongahela      National Forest . . . and won! The Forest Service, though,      has taken the farfetched position that the court decision      affects only that one national forest . . . an      interpretation which is flimsy, at best. Don't be surprised      if timber sales involving clear-cuts are soon challenged      everywhere. (If you live near a national forest that's up      for such "harvesting" and want to stop it, write to the      Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, 311 California St., San      Francisco, Calif. 94104 for advice.)    </p>    <h3>POLLUTED PORTFOLIOS</h3>  <p>      The Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural      Resources Defense Council, and National Audubon Society all      came in for a pounding recently when the <em>Los Angeles      Times</em> revealed that those organizations own stock in      the very businesses they criticize most: oil companies,      electric utilities, strip mining firms, and other big      polluters. Time magazine picked up the story, and angry      members have been berating their organizations ever since.    </p>    <p>      Dave Brower, president of Friends of the Earth (which, by      the way, came out smelling sweet . . . we don't have any      money to invest) rushed to the defense of the groups caught      with egg on their portfolio faces. In a letter to the      <em>L.A. Times,</em> Brower observed: "It would be almost      impossible for (Audubon, et al.) not to invest in      polluters, or for individuals not to. If you are insured,      or have deposits in a bank, or fly or drive or read or eat,      you are helping polluters in their daily rounds . . . .    </p>    <p>      "It seems to me that there are two courses open to the      management of environmental organizations, and indeed to      all investors, not excluding universities.    </p>    <p>      "One is to take advantage of stock ownership and to show up      at stockholder meetings and demand that the corporations be      environmentally responsible and stop talking nonsense about      how they must pollute in the U.S. or abroad in order to      create jobs. There are myriad jobs in abating pollution . .      . worthwhile jobs, well worth investing i n because the      world is better off for the work done.    </p>    <p>      "The other is to take prompt advantage of what the Council      on Economic Priorities is now making possible: the shifting      of investments to corporations who are performing best in      the effort to 'clean up'."    </p>  <h3>NUCLEAR NOTES</h3>    <p>      The TVA's reactor at Browns Ferry, Alabama suffered a      near-catastrophic accident recently when two electricians      set the place on fire while checking for air leaks with a      candle. The report of the incident reads like high farce.      with every possible mishap (yes, including many that the      nuclear industry says can't take place) mishappening.    </p>    <p>      Two new pro-nuclear booster groups have been formed, with      large infusions of dollars from the atomic industry. Watch      out for "Americans for Energy Independence" and the      "American Nuclear Energy Council" . . . their messages may      well turn up in your newspaper and with your utility bill.    </p>    <p>      Twenty-five hundred scientists, engineers, and      doctors-including nine Nobel laureates-have      signed a declaration of concern over nuclear power and sent      it to President Ford, The statement stops short of      advocating what FOE thinks is necessarya complete and      immediate halt to construction and operation of all      commercial reactors-but it does recommend "a drastic      reduction in new nuclear power plant construction starts"      and a halt to the program of exporting nuclear plants to      other countries. Newspapers across the U.S. largely ignored      the statement, which was released on the anniversary of the      bombing of Hiroshima.    </p>    <p>      <em>The Prometheus Crisis,</em> by the folks who brought      you <em>The Towering Inferno,</em> will be published by the      time you read this. Movie rights are already sold. The      Prometheus is a hypothetical nuclear plant in southern      California that suffers a catastrophic accident. Early      rumors say the book is wellwritten and technically      accurate. It and the movie should read legitimate nuclear      concern widely.    </p>    <h3>MISCELLANY</h3>    <p>      EPA Administrator Russell Train has banned the pesticides      chlordane and heptachlor due to "imminent cancer hazards"      to humans. The two, pesticides cause cancer in animals, and      were found in 73 percent of all dairy products and 77      percent of all meat, fish, and poultry samples examined in      a study by the EPA.    </p>    <p>      * * * * *    </p>    <p>      The big environmental confrontation of this year (and next)      may well prove to be the battle over plans to build a huge,      coal-fired electric generating plant on the Kaiparowits      Plateau in southern Utah. Pollution from the installation      would contaminate some of the cleanest air and most      beautiful landscape in the country . . . all to provide      unnecessary kilowatts to Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Los      Angeles.    </p>    <p>      * * * * *    </p>    <p>      The government and the oil companies have been anxious to      lease Outer Continental Shelf lands for exploratory      offshore drilling. Conservationists oppose these hasty      leases. For one thing, we don't even know how much oil is      there. Last year, for example, the U.S. Geological Survey      said that the Atlantic offshore area contained ten to      twenty billion barrels of crude. This year, the USES says      there's only two to four billion barrels.    </p>    <p>      Various state governments are now fighting against the      giveaway leases. California's legislature just passed a      bill forbidding new leasing or drilling. . . and the Golden      State's hotshot new governor, Jerry Brown, signed the      measure into law. Many of California's officials even      questioned whether the U.S. should <em>ever</em> lease oil      lands to private multi-national corporations, whose      policies and price-setting methods are not always      calculated with the public's best interests at heart.    </p>    <p>      Alaska's Governor Hammond, however, has decided to go ahead      and lease the Beaufort Sea for oil and gas development.      He's primarily motivated by his state's sinking financial      status. The pipeline project, once thought a boon for      Alaska, has since cost "the Last Frontier" much more than      originally estimated. Crime is up, prices are tip, welfare      is up, and so are the tempers of pipeline workers. State      revenues are down. Governor Hammond thinks, apparently,      that even more development will solve Alaska's development      problems. Sine all evidence is to the contrary, we can only      wonder . . . .    </p>
