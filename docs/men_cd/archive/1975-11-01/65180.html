            		        <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Wayne P. Merry started and ran for five      years the biggest Nordic ski school on the West Coast      (Yosemite Mountaineering). He's made cross-country ski      trips as much as 300 miles long and is one of the directors      of the National Hiking and Ski Touring Association.    </p>    <p>      WAYNE P. MERRY:    </p>    <p>      It was great to see Paul Stanton's article in MOTHER NO. 31      on getting into cross-country, or Nordic, skiing cheaply.      Like the cost of everything else, the price of equipment      for this sport has been going up like the dickens. It may      not be long before Nordic gear costs what downhill used to.      A cycle repeated?    </p>    <p>      I started the same way Paul did: by cutting the metal edges      off an old pair of wooden downhill jobs (that looked as if      they'd been hand-carved by a Viking), modifying a set of      old bear-trap bindings that weighed about 2 pounds each,      sizzling in some pine tar with a plumber's blowtorch, and      setting off to see the Alaskan woods.    </p>    <p>      Well, it's a great way to begin. Try it. Once you discover      what's out there, you'll be hooked. Quite often, though,      that converted ancient equipment won't even last through      your gyrations as a learner. For instance, those      hand-me-down poles, if very old, usually have rotten      leather in the baskets. Which means that-sooner or      later-when you put a bit of weight on one of the      supports to regain your balance, the basket will remain in      the snow and you'll find yourself trying to pole your way      home with a lance!    </p>    <p>      In five years of teaching cross-country, I've seen a lot of      folks start out with improvised gear . . . and at least      they <em>started,</em> which is the main thing. Eventually,      though, such beginners want equipment which will perform.      Even if everything holds together, you'll find after a      while that you want to go lighter and farther and faster      and learn that pretty stretched-out stride you see in the      books (and can't do with your old outfit).    </p>    <p>      Here, then, are some ways to get started in this sport at      low cost, and still provide yourself with workable gear:    </p>    <p>      First, a few words about skis. Those old heavy touring or      downhill boards which Paul describes will get you around,      although you'll be wearing about twice as much weight as      you need. The main problem you'll have is finding a pair      which hasn't deteriorated. Too often, Goodwill bargains      crack or break right in the middle of a long trip. (A      friend of mine had a pair snap for no apparent reason      halfway across the Sierra. Fortunately, he was both      ingenious and strong.)    </p>    <p>      An alternative-a far better heavy touring      ski-can sometimes be found in military surplus      stores: U.S. Army issue, mostly hickory to judge from the      weight, and darn near indestructible. These sturdy articles      are usually painted white . . . but if the aesthetics mean      anything to you, the paint can be removed and replaced with      clear varnish for a pretty natural finish. You can also cut      down the edges to make a lighter ski, very like the modern      general touring type.    </p>    <p>      Another source of good, inexpensive skis is an      establishment which rents cross-country gear. Every couple      of years-or more often-such a firm replaces      skis which are no longer very presentable (although they      still may be quite serviceable). The castoffs are often      sold, commonly with bindings still mounted, at a fraction      of their retail cost. If you can find a pair which is just      beat up and has no structural damage, you've usually got      something good . . . because if a ski can stand a year or      two of rental to beginners, it has to be tough!    </p>    <p>      Here are a couple of hints to help you when you're checking      out a collection of possible purchases: If you're after      sturdiness and aren't particular about weight, look for a      general touring ski which-if it's Scandinavian in      origin-may be marked "Tur Model" or "Tur Ski". Less      hefty types are light touring and racing skis ("Tur      Langrenn" and "Langrenn" respectively in Norwegian).    </p>    <p>      A good general touring ski, incidentally, is <em>not</em>      fragile . . . especially when compared to a pair of antique      heavyweights that may have been sitting in a damp garage      for 20 years. Four of us toured 300 miles on Bonna      2400's-above the Arctic Circle and carrying 70-pound      packs-and the skis performed perfectly.    </p>    <p>      I wouldn't worry too much about the flotation of lighter      equipment, either. If you use skis of standard      length-long enough, when stood on end, to reach the      wrist or palm of a hand held at arm's length over your      head-you'll find that extra-wide antiques won't hold      you up any better than general or even light touring skis.      A friend of mine, a park ranger, used to go on mufti-day      ski patrols with little skinny <em>racing</em> skis . . .      and his companions, on the widest and longest boards they      could get, found that he performed just as well as they did      in deep snow (while carrying a lot less weight strapped to      his feet).    </p>    <p>      Flotation-then, to repeat-is actually more a      function of length than width. If you're planning to do a      lot of trailless deep snow skiing and really want the      equivalent of a gigantic snowshoe to slide around on with      no great speed, just get the longest darn skis you can      find. You'll plod, but float a bit better.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too-if you have a lot of off-trail deep      snow travel ahead of you-that most cross-country ski      bindings are mounted to hold the boards (during a step)      with their tips pointed down at about a 20Â° angle. This      is done to provide the right balance for the traditional      Nordic stride, especially in a packed track. When you're      sinking into the snow at every step,      though-especially in deep powder or overdepth      hoar-you'll find that the whole length of each ski      (which is so mounted) will break through the surface and      sink in at every stride. This makes for tough going, since      the heavier tip of the board doesn't climb out well and has      to be raised with the toe of the boot. What you want is the      tail alone to break through so that you "only" have to      "climb out" of a hole as you make each step.    </p>    <p>      Accordingly, if deep snow trudging is what you foresee,      adjust your bindings so that the skis hang level during      your strides. (Attach the fastenings temporarily with tape      to determine the points of balance.) Remember, though, that      this adjustment won't perform well on a packed track when      you attempt the traditional Nordic stride.    </p>    <p>      Another pressing question for the beginner is the matter of      footwear. One consideration here is that if you buy special      crosscountry boots, you won't usually have much trouble      fitting bindings (since Nordic equipment is getting very      standardized now). On the other hand, it takes quite a      while to get bindings adjusted to hiking boots . . . and      some such combinations just won't work at all.      Unfortunately, the salesperson who tells you that special      footgear is important may just be right.    </p>    <p>      However, if (like most of us) you haven't got large      quantities of bread to spare, you might make do with      substitutes for a while. Be aware, though, that the little      lip on the outside of most cable bindings-which is      designed to fit over the edge of a ski boot sole-may      tear the dickens out of the corresponding part of a hiking      boot . . . and there goes 50 bucks or more! If you can      remove that metal rim one way or another and replace it      with a strap that passes over your toe just far enough back      so the leather loop won't slip off, so much the better.    </p>    <p>      And if you can find a set of the old Army surplus universal      bindings, you're better off yet. With them, you'll be able      to strap on your skis and go cross-country while wearing      almost any footwear. (The military binding is a piece of      belting screwed to the ski at the front and supplied with a      heel cup at the back, plus a couple of straps around toe      and ankle. It's a bigger version of the Balata fastenings      sold in good ski stores for little kiddies' X-C use.)    </p>    <p>      In any case, avoid stiff hiking footwear such as mountain      boots. They're so darned heavy that they'll wear you out      way ahead of time, and the inflexibility of their soles      prevents the bending at the base of the toes which is so      important to a free stride. The same factor means that much      less circulation is pumped through each foot than is common      with the very flexible Nordic boots . . . and that means      colder feet. The only case of honest-to-God frostbite I've      seen happen to a crosscountry skier in the Sierra was      directly attributable to such footwear. His companions, who      wore much lighter Nordic boots, had no trouble.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, what it boils down to is that if you improvise      with old equipment, or gear that was designed for another      purpose, you're going to have a certain amount of trouble.      The sooner you can latch onto some used touring skis,      boots, and bindings, the more you'll enjoy the sport and      the more dependable the gear will be. Keep a sharp eye on      surplus stores, spring sales at Nordic rental      shops-and even ski swaps-and you might find a      <em>real</em> bargain.    </p>    <p>      JEREMY SCHMIDT:    </p>    <p>      Skiing is my profession, and I was distressed by some of      the misinformation in Paul Stanton's "Cross-Country Skiing      . . . The Low-Cost Way" (MOTHER NO. 31). Let me be brief:    </p>    <p>      [1] "Skinny skis"-which Stanton says are best suited      only for very light touring-have taken me and      hundreds of others over and through the most rugged      mountains of the U.S. and Canada. They're strong, and they      do fine even in 80 or 90 percent of the fresh new snow in      the Rockies.    </p>    <p>      [2] Special X-C boots are <em>much</em> warmer than heavy      footwear, because they can't become soaked and freeze like      iron maidens on a skier's feet. I wear light touring shoes      on two-week high country camping trips, and companions with      mountain boots always suffer more from cold than I do.    </p>    <p>      [3] The great joy of X-C skiing comes not just from the      beauty of the country you get into . . . but also from the      ease of action, the strong, fast stride, the feeling that      your motion is somehow magically aided by the wings of      Mercury. To slog along on 10-pound skis (I own a pair . . .      I know) is a cost in terms of enjoyment and satisfaction      far greater than the $30.00 or $40.00 saved.    </p>    <p>      A better way to save dollars on cross-country equipment is      to wait for the spring sales, when good gear can be      obtained complete for $50.00 to $60.00. Would you buy an      elephant when you needed a horse, even if the elephant were      cheap Carthaginian war surplus?    </p>    <p>      ERIC JOHNSON:    </p>    <p>      I'd like to add a little advice to the suggestions Paul      Stanton made in his excellent article.    </p>    <p>      First, when you're looking for secondhand equipment, you      should lay both skis on a flat surface to check for camber      . . . which gives the resilience needed for proper glide on      flat ground and the flexibility for downhill travel.      Ideally, the test should show an inch to an inch and a half      of space under the middle of the ski.    </p>    <p>      Also, if the skis have bindings already attached, be sure      the fastenings aren't glued on with epoxy (which make them      almost impossible to remove). Good touring to you!    </p>
