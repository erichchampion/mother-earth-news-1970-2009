            	        <h5 id="byline">by Tom Reidy</h5>    <p>      The USSR covers one-sixth of the world's surface, embraces      13 republics, and is home to scores of ethnic groups. Among      these are many strains of sturdy peasant stock who have      developed their own frugal yet satisfying lifestyles . . .      lifestyles that include some superb traditional cookery. A      number of Russian dishes rely heavily on milk by-products      and may interest MOTHER readers who own bountiful dairy      animals.    </p>    <p>      TVOROG    </p>    <p>      <em>Tvorog</em> , the Russian cream cheese, is eaten      extensively-either by itself or in a variety of      dishes-and is a good use for sour milk.    </p>    <p>      To make this specialty, put at least two quarts of      solidified sour milk into a muslin bag and hang it over a      basin to strain off the whey. Leave the curd until it      becomes firm but not too dry, and mash it until it's smooth      and creamy. The cheese is especially good mixed with      chopped chives and a pinch of salt and eaten on buttered      rye bread.    </p>    <p>      SMETANA    </p>    <p>      <em>Smetana-sour cream-</em> is easy to make:      Just leave heavy cream in a warm place until it becomes      tart in flavor . . . a matter of two or three days, unless      you accelerate the process by the addition of a teaspoon of      sour milk or a few drops of lemon juice. Be careful not to      let the product go cheesy.    </p>    <p>      VARENETZ    </p>    <p>      The following ingredients are needed for this old Russian      dish:    </p>    <p>      8 cups creamy milk<br />      1 cup <em>smetana</em><br />      Cinnamon<br />      Sugar<br />      Rye breadcrumbs    </p>    <p>      Pour the milk into a wide earthenware dish and cook it in      the oven at very low heat. When a skin forms and the milk      assumes a faint golden color, push the film to the bottom      of the pan. Repeat this step five or six times. Then remove      the dish from the oven and let it stand until the milk is      tepid. Add the <em>smetana,</em> mix the pudding well, and      let it sit in a warm place for 24 hours. Refrigerate the      dish until it's wanted, and serve it sprinkled with sugar,      cinnamon, and rye breadcrumbs.    </p>    <p>      DRACHONA    </p>    <p>      <em>Drachona-</em> <em>a baked batter</em> -can      be eaten with roasted meat as a pleasant change from      Yorkshire pudding, or sprinkled with sugar and served hot      with melted butter as a dessert. You'll need the following      ingredients:    </p>    <p>      1 cup flour<br />      3 eggs<br />      2/3 cup smetana<br />      Salt<br />      2-1/2 cups milk    </p>    <p>      Place the flour in a bowl, make a hollow in the mound,      break the eggs into the depression, and mix well. Blend in      the <em>smetana,</em> add a pinch of salt, and beat the      combination until it's smooth and light. Warm the milk and      add it gradually to the mixture. Continue beating for a few      minutes.. Then pass the batter through a sieve, pour it      into a buttered dish, and bake it in a moderate oven for 30      minutes. If the dish is to be served as a dessert, pour 6      tablespoons of melted butter over it and sprinkle with 2      tablespoons of sugar.    </p>    <p>      CUCUMBER WITH SMETANA    </p>    <p>      1 large cucumber<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      2/3 cup <em>smetana</em><br />      1/4 teaspoon pepper<br />      2 teaspoons lemon juice    </p>    <p>      Peel the cucumber, slice it thin, sprinkle with salt, and      leave it for about an hour. Strain off the liquid. Combine      the <em>smetana,</em> pepper, and lemon juice, pour the      mixture over the cucumber slices, and serve the dish      chilled.    </p>    <p>      GOLUBTSY (STUFFED CABBAGE LEAVES)    </p>    <p>      2 onions, chopped<br />      3 tablespoons butter<br />      1 pound ground beef<br />      Salt and pepper<br />      1/2 cup cooked rice<br />      1 cup stock<br />      1 medium-sized white cabbage<br />      1 tablespoon flour<br />      1-1/4 cup smetana<br />      2 tablespoons tomato puree<br />      (or 1 cup tomatoes)<br />      2 teaspoons sugar<br />      2 tablespoons vinegar<br />      (or the juice of 1/2 lemon)    </p>    <p>      Fry the chopped onions lightly in 1 tablespoon of the      butter. Add the ground beef with salt and pepper to taste      and continue the frying for a few minutes. Then remove the      pan from the heat and mix in the cooked rice and a little      of the stock.    </p>    <p>      The whole cabbage should be cooked until soft in salted      water. The leaves should then be separated and flattened,      and the thick stalks cut away. Put about 1 tablespoon of      the meat filling on each leaf, roll up the little package,      and turn in the ends. Fry the rolls in 1 tablespoon of      butter until they're browned lightly on all sides, and pack      them closely in a casserole.    </p>    <p>      Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter, blend in the      flour, and dilute the sauce with the rest of the stock. Add      the <em>smetana,</em> the tomatoes or puree, and the sugar.      Salt to taste. Boil the mixture and stir it well. Remove      the liquid from the heat, add the lemon juice or vinegar,      and pour the sauce over the cabbage rolls. Cook the dish in      a slow oven for 1 hour. This is a firm favorite with my      family.    </p>
