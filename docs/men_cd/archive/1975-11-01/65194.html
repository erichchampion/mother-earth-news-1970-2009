                    <p>      Substantial amounts of household heat are lost through      single-pane windows like these. Storm windows, or plastic      sheeting taped over the frames, can cut the leakage in half      . . . and closed drapes-or, better yet, insulated      shutters-reduce heat loss even more.</p><p>This bundled-up      sleeper has the right idea: You can cut heating costs as      much as 15% just by turning the thermostat down to 60°      F at bedtime. Use quilts, warm night wear, and-if you      like-furry bedfellows to take the bite out of chilly winter      nights.</p><p>Chilly drafts like to sneak into a house through      cracks at the edges of door and window frames. Caulking and      weather stripping are inexpensive do-it-yourself projects      which can slice 10% or more off the average household's      energy bill.</p><p> Since moist air holds heat better than dry,      your home will stay warmer at less cost, if you keep its      relative humidity at 35 to 40%. Although a humidifier like      this one is ideal, pans of water on radiators-or a      good collection of houseplants-will also help.</p><p>For      satisfactory temperature control, a thermostat is best      located in a draft-free spot-always on an interior      wall-and at least three feet from lamps, TV sets, and      other heat-generating appliances.</p><p>Radios, TV sets, and      electric lights aren't big consumers of current . . . but      they all add up. It's a good ecological practice (and just      plain good sense) to turn off any appliance you're not      actually using.</p><p>An "instant on " TV set-especially of the      tube type-uses power even when the screen is dark. It's      best to plug such a unit into a socket controlled by a wall      switch, or to provide it with an extra on-off control.</p><p>      Radios, TV sets, and electric lights aren't big consumers      of current . . . but they all add up. It's a good      ecological practice (and just plain good sense) to turn off      any appliance you're not actually using.</p><p>An "instant on "      TV set-especially of the tube type-uses power even when he      screen is dark. It's best to plug such a unit into a socket      controlled by a wall switch, or to provide it with an extra      on-off control.</p><p>Light-colored walls, rugs, drapes, and      furnishings are efficient reflectors which reduce the      amount of artificial illumination needed to keep a room      bright and cheerful.</p><p>In areas where bright illumination is      needed, one large incandescent bulb performs more      efficiently than several smaller ones . . . and all lights      function best when well dusted.</p><p>Your furnace must be      correctly adjusted to operate properly. You can cut its      fuel consumption as much as 10% by having the system      serviced yearly . . . preferably each fall. Filters used in      forced-air heating should be cleaned or replaced monthly,      and all radiators and other elements kept dust free.</p><p>An      efficient alternative to a conventional furnace is the heat      pump, which supplies 1-1 /2 to 2-1 /2 times as much heat as      the electrical energy needed for its operation . . . and      will also provide air conditioning come summer.</p><p>Since a      natural gas heater needs a good flow of oxygen for top      performance, make sure the unit's air intake is working      well.</p><p>It's very important to check heating ducts for leaks,      and to insulate any portions of the system that pass      through unheated areas of the house (such as garages and      basements). Otherwise, large quantities of warmth will      escape on the way to lived-in rooms where the heat is most      needed.</p><p>More than half the energy used in American homes      goes into keeping our houses at livable temperatures . . .      and every degree over 70° F can add 5% to a family's      fuel consumption (and costs). Substantial savings may be      gained by leaving your thermostat at 68° during the day      (and wearing a sweater if you feel chilly).</p><p>We're sorry      that we have to evict that bird from its comfortable nest .      . . but chimneys should be cleaned yearly to avoid the      danger of fire and to allow proper functioning of the      household heating system.</p><p> Warm air, of course, rises . . .      all too often, into the attic and on out through the roof.      A 6inch layer of insulation between the upstairs storeroom      and the main part of the house will cut this loss to a      minimum.</p><p>      If you can't resist the charm of an open fire, a wise      choice of fuel will help to reduce its disadvantages.      Hardwoods burn hot and clean and are preferable to      softwoods, which emit chimney-fouling creosote.</p><p>A good way      to improve the performance of a standard fireplace is to      install a bent-pipe logholding device sold under the name      of "Thermograte". This ingenious fittingwhich works by      drawing air through its metal tubes-directs heat out into      the room (instead of up the chimney).</p><p>Partial closing of      the damper when the fireplace is in use will help to      control the escape of heat up the flue. (You don't need a      roaring blaze for coziness.) The damper should be fully      shut at all other times.</p><p>Food to be roasted, broiled, or      baked for more than an hour can be put directly into a cold      oven. If it's necessary to preheat the oven, 10 minutes is      usually long enough. Once the dish has been launched, it      should be left to its own devices (since each peek costs      you something like 25 degrees of useful temperature).</p><p>The      perfect pot for stove-top use is straight sided and flat      bottomed, covers the entire burner, and comes with a      tightfitting lid. It's best (for both thrift and nutrition)      to cook with little water and to turn down the heat as soon      as the liquid boils. Clean burner reflector pans also help      to save energy.</p><p>Electric dishwashers operate most      economically at full capacity (you may need to accumulate      utensils from several meals, if your family is small). And      have you considered letting dishes air-dry after the rinse      cycle is over?</p><p>Frost-which acts as an insulator and makes      it harder for a freezer to rid itself of warm air-shouldn't      be allowed to build up thicker than 1/4 inch. Dusty      condenser coils are another energy drain to avoid.</p><p>This      hungry gal would probably be startled to learn the actual      cost of her midnight snack. Cold air rapidly spills out of      an open refrigerator and large amounts of energy are needed      to again lower the I temperature of the box. It's important      to keep the unit closed as much as possible . . . and to be      sure it closes tight. If the door's edge won't grip a piece      of paper, its gasket should be replaced.</p><p>For obvious      reasons, the faithful family refrigerator will have to work      overtime (and consume more energy) if it's placed right      beside the stove. The appliances pictured here are in a      good relative position.</p><p>The production of hot water-the      second biggest item on the American householder's energy      budget-accounts for 15% of home power consumption. You can      cut this figure by locating the water heater as near as      possible to the points where most of its output is used (to      avoid heat loss in piping).</p><p>      A good way to reduce the expense of hot water production is      to revise your idea of "hot". Clothes, dishes, and human      beings can be washed effectively in water heated to      120° F. . . and cold liquid is quite adequate for many      cleaning jobs. (Don't believe, by the way, that articles      are "sterilized" by washing them at higher temperatures.      'Tain't so, unless you process them at least five minutes      at 212° F.)</p><p>      One dripping taucet can waste thousands of gallons of water      yearly . . . and if it's hot water, the energy loss is      considerable. Well-maintained plumbing is kinder to your      budget and to the nation's resources.</p><p>      The dryer's exhaust on the outside of your house needs a      periodic cleaning. A partly blocked vent means longer      drying times and the use of morethan-necessary current.</p><p>If      you've always hated ironing, here's a cast-iron excuse not      to do any: An ordinary hand iron-which converts      electricity to heat by the rather inefficient methods of      resistance-uses three times as much power as a color      TV set would consume in the same period. Natural non-iron      fabrics, then, save energy... yours and the nation's.      Artificial fibers, however, are frequently a different      story since-because they don't "breathe" -some      people find such clothes make them swelter in hot weather      and feel clammy during cold snaps.</p><p>Your washer and dryer      will perform best when full but not overloaded. A few      hints: Wash in warm or cold water if possible, sort clothes      by weight for drying, and dry them in consecutive batches      to make use of the heat which has already built up in your      dryer. Check the lint screen often and remove accumulations      of fluff. Or air- and sun-dry your clothes outdoors on a      line!    </p>
