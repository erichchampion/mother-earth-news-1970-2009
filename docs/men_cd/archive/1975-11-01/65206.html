        <h1 id="title">The Root Cellar<br />That Ain't!</h1><p>A whole lot of people planted gardens this year, but it's a good bet that most of them don't live anywhere near a farm, to say nothing of owning a root cellar. So how can those folks store such vegetables as squash and turnips and potatoes and the like?</p><p>Well, Charles D. Syverson (who some readers might recognize as the coauthor of a little manual on wind energy titled <em>Wind Power)</em> has come up with one answer: a build-yer-own, 24-cubic-foot food storage chest-not a freezer, but a do-it-yourself root cellar-that'll keep vegetables at a constant, thermostatically controlled temperature for months on end.</p><p>After some ten years of experimenting, perfecting, and trying out various prototypes, Syverson has come up with the ideal unit for the job <em>and</em> the best way to put it together . . . and he's rendered everything lie knows about the subject into a booklet of plans and instructions so that you, too, can build "a root cellar that ain't".</p><p>All you'll need to do the job-once you're armed with Charles' guide-is the inclination, ordinary hand tools, and relatively common electrical and construction materials which cost (according to Syverson's estimate) around $121. (No, that price ain't low . . . but it includes such largeticket items as an air-circulating fan and line voltage thermostat, and the finished chest itself is designed to last a good many years.)</p><p>The booklet, entitled (appropriately enough), <em>Complete Plans and Instructions for Making a 24-Cubic-Foot Food Storage Chest,</em> is written and illustrated with rare clarity. Nearly anyone-no matter how fumble-fingered-should be able to put the device together with a minimum of trouble. The plans cost $3.95, and can be ordered by writing Syverson Consulting, 2007 Roe Crest Drive, North Mankato, Minn. 56001.</p>
