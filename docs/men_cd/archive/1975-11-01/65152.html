                    <p>      <strong>(and other ways to come unstruck)</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here in New Hampshire, the word "road" is used pretty      loosely . . . to mean any track a vehicle just might be      able to make it over in most seasons. During my first      winter on the homestead, I quickly learned that getting      there is a lot less than half the fun when you're      scratching your head in 20Â°-below weather, wondering      whether a crane would work better than a team of oxen to      put that old heap back on the road (and you next to a      fire). Since I have a strong aversion to shelling out the      week's grocery money to a guy with a tow truck a couple of      times a year, I've picked up a few tricks for liberating      stuck vehicles . . . and I'd like to share them with you.    </p>    <p>      The elemental problems drivers usually encounter are snow,      ice, mud, and the roadside ditches that machines are prone      to leap into if not properly supervised. Since those of you      in the city will probably meet only the first two      conditions, I'll begin with them.    </p>    <p>      Often, coming unstuck from snow is only a matter of getting      enough traction. Snow tires or studs will usually take care      of this . . . and, if you have a front-engine auto, keeping      a little extra weight in the trunk will help.    </p>    <p>      Still, those measures don't always do the job. On sheet      ice, for example, snow tires get even less traction than      standard tires because-at any given moment-they      have less surface area in contact with the road. Which is      why that extra weight in the trunk should be sand . . . and      please note that you can't just scoop up a couple of      boxfuls somewhere and leave it at that. Unless your      non-skid material is properly prepared before it's packed      away with the jack and tire iron, you may find yourself      trying to throw a 100-pound frozen brick under your wheels      (which won't do any good at all).    </p>    <p>      I know only two ways to keep stored sand from freezing: [1]      Mix salt with it, or [2] dry it thoroughly and stash it in      an airtight container. Although the first method is easier,      I've preferred the second ever since I read that one-sixth      of the salt mined annually in the United States is spread      on roads . . . where it eats cars and makes the soil and      water much more saline than they should be.    </p>    <p>      Tire chains-another traction-boosting      device-will easily pay for themselves whether you      live in the city or country. For emergency or light duty,      short clip-on lengths of chain (available for a couple of      bucks) will do. For frequent use or for rural roads,      though, you should get a good set of wraparounds . , .      which will cost from $15.00 to $40.00, depending on size      and quality.    </p>    <p>      Once the chains are in place, you'll usually make it      anywhere you have to go . . . but I've never met anyone who      thought installing such devices was fun, and there'll      probably be times when you're just too cold or lazy to do      so before the car gets stuck. Well, don't despair! You      don't really have to drive over the spread-out chains to      fit them to the wheels . . . a good thing, too, since it's      obviously out of the question when the truck or whatever is      already lodged in a snowdrift.    </p>    <p>      Here's how to install chains without moving your vehicle:      First make sure there are no twists or kinks anywhere in      one of the pair. Then drape the chain over the top of the      tire and hook up its catch-link on the inside of the wheel.      (Practice will enable you to do this without lying on the      ground.) The next step may be a bit of a fight, depending      on how tightly the chains fit: Work the cross-links down      over the tire's tread while pulling the ends of the chain      until you can fasten the outside catch-link. Finally, add      the spreaders. Then repeat the process on the other rear      wheel and drive away. I once saw a guy go through this      routine in the dark, with both back wheels two-thirds under      water . . . which just goes to show that the job isn't as      hard as it sounds.    </p>    <p>      If the wildest place you ever drive is the L.A. freeway, of      course, there's no need to make your car's trunk look like      Admiral Byrd's dogsled . . . but if you're like me and live      (or are planning to live) back up in the woods, it pays to      take a tip from the Boy Scouts and be prepared for the      conditions you're likely to meet. This means you'll have to      find room in your auto for a few "extra" items.    </p>    <p>      One piece of emergency equipment-a shovel-is a      must . . . and is required by law in some states. A bow saw      or axe can also come in handy. It's really frustrating to      have a single downed 8-inch tree between you and your      destination . . . when the only woodcutting tool you're      carrying is a penknife.    </p>    <p>      Of course, no reader of this article would ever drive about      without a working flashlight . . . and its friendly beam      will indeed be ever-ready (despite faulty switches,      carelessness, and children's fingers) if you'll always      store the electric torch away with one battery reversed.      Then, when you bog down on a backroad some dark night, just      turn the cell to its "right" position and the light will      shine!    </p>    <p>      You'll most likely have a jack with you anyway. . . and if      yours is a bumper model, of <em>better quality than those      the big three include with their new cars,</em> it can be      used in a pinch to get your vehicle out of mud. Set the      jack on a wide, flat plank or rock-to keep it from      disappearing into the mire-and hoist the auto up      enough to get boards, stones, or whatever under the tires.      Always expect the jack to slip while you're doing this      (that is, stay clear of the support and try not to keep      your hands under the automobile or truck wheels any longer      than necessary). Be aware, too, that the planks, etc., may      be shot backward when you get the stuck car rolling . . .      which means that your helpers should grasp the door handles      and push from the sides rather than the back.    </p>    <p>      Also-if you've run off the road, but not too far      off-you can use the bumper jack to correct matters,      by hoisting the vehicle and pushing it off the support      sideways in the proper direction. I don't like to do this      because it's slow and dangerous and may damage the auto. If      you must try, though, you'll find it advisable to push with      a long sapling shoved under the frame or bumper to act as a      lever. This not only gives you a little more thrust, but      serves to put some distance between you and the jack (which      can move very rapidly on occasion).    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, I've heard that you can winch a stuck vehicle      out of a bad spot by means of a length of chain and the      jack placed horizontally. Could be. I tried it once, and      decided that my life was worth more than a towing charge.    </p>    <p>      Actually, the jack-in any position-is my least      favorite means of coming unstuck. I know two other ways      (apart from human or vehicular brute force) to accomplish      the same purpose, and both work so well it's a joy to write      about them.    </p>    <p>      First, if you live in the country, I'd strongly advise      spending about $35.00 on a come-along (Fig. 1) . . . a      compact manually operated winch. (The two-ton model is only      slightly more expensive than the smaller sizes, and is well      worth the difference.) I'd need an entire article to      describe all the uses for this little wonder (even if I      knew them all), so I'll merely point out that it can get a      vehicle out of almost any drift, ditch, or mudhole.    </p>    <p>      The operation of the come-along is simple. The winch has a      grab-hook on the back of its frame and a hook and length of      cable on its spool. (Check the line for wear periodically,      and make sure all connections are secure.) When in trouble,      one fastens the towline to the auto's frame or some other      solid portion of its anatomy and the winch-hook to a piece      of chain moored to a sturdy rock or tree. (If possible,      protect the trunk of alive tree with an old inner tube,      piece of cardboard, etc., to prevent damage to the bark.)      These hookup positions can be reversed, depending on where      it's convenient for the winch operator to stand.    </p>    <p>      If you're alone, you'll just have to muscle the vehicle      along . . . but it's best if someone else can help by      driving. When the cable is very taut and the auto is just      starting to move, the driver should spin the wheels fast      enough to help progress and reduce friction. (Don't do      this, of course, if the car is simply digging itself in      deeper.) When the machine moves forward, the cable will go      slack, and the driver must then hit the brakes to keep the      vehicle from sliding back while the winch operator catches      up.    </p>        <p>      So much for the come-along. Which brings us to my favorite      little-known and highly effective device: the magic rope. I      met it myself back before I had the come-along, when      Babe-my old three-quarter-ton      pickup-maliciously put her left front and rear wheels      into a muddy ditch a mile down an abandoned road. At the      time I wasn't especially concerned, since nearby friends of      mine had two four-wheel-drive Land Rovers. A few hours      later, though, when one Rover pushing and the other pulling      still hadn't budged ale Babe, I was getting worried. I felt      pretty sure that a tow truck would do no good, even if I      could get a driver to go back to where my pickup was bogged      down . . . so I called Robbie, a local guy who has unstuck      more vehicles than the Triple-A.    </p>    <p>      "Come and get my rope," Robbie told me when he'd heard my      story.    </p>    <p>      "No rope is gonna get Babe outta there," I said, surprised      that the expert would suggest anything so inappropriate to      the direness of the situation.    </p>    <p>      "This one will, it's special," Robbie laughed . . . and,      since I had nothing to lose, I went over to his place and      picked up a contraption like the one shown in Fig. 2.    </p>    <p>      The key to this setup is the nylon rope, which doesn't jerk      like a chain . . . but is elastic, like a rubber band. The      result is that the towing vehicle can drive away from a      stuck car or truck at some speed . . . and believe me, that      helps. Why? Well, suppose you eased a truck up to a brick      wall until the bumper touched, and then pushed. OK, now      imagine hitting that same wall at 50 mph. The difference,      of course, is momentum, and the springiness of nylon allows      you to harness that energy.    </p>    <p>      To use the magic rope, be sure any tangled cords are      untwisted, back the rescue truck up against the immobilized      auto, and attach one end of the line. Then coil the      remainder of the rope so it will feed smoothly, and fasten      the other grab-hook to the towing vehicle. All that remains      is to drive the already mobile machine away. With old Babe,      the first try-at 5 mph-rocked her back and      forth, and after the next run-at 10 mph-I was      on my way home.    </p>    <p>      I've never seen this technique damage a vehicle (the shock      travels very slowly and evenly through the nylon, and the      car moves forward smoothly rather than jerking as it does      behind a cable or chain) . . . and I've never had to drive      the tow car or truck away at more than 15 mph to make the      magic rope work.    </p>    <p>      If you want to make a towing device like the one I've      described, you can get the necessary half-inch nylon rope      at a marine supply house . . . and a few friends might do      well to get together and share the cost (because this stuff      is expensive). And don't plan to use the cord for any other      purpose, because those knots will never come out.    </p>    <p>      Well, I hope you don't get stuck at all this winter . . .      but if you do, the tricks I've mentioned should help.      Pleasant motoring!    </p>
