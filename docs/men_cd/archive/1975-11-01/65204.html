                    <h5 id="byline">      by Harlan Attfield    </h5>    <p>      Many town and city dwellers are becoming interested in      homesite farming these days . . . and, where local      ordinances permit, such an operation might well include a      small flock of poultry. If you've always wanted to keep a      few chickens, but held off because you thought that the      project required more room than you can spare from your      limited plot . . . well, it doesn't have to!    </p>    <p>      When necessary, although they won't be as happy as they      would in a large run, chickens can be kept in a very      restricted area and still enjoy good health and a      reasonable degree of comfort. That's the goal I had in mind      when I planned the cage you see in the accompanying      illustrations. The coop measures 7-1/2 by 3 feet and      provides brooding, growing, and laying facilities for 10 to      12 birds . . . enough to produce half a dozen eggs a day,      which is more than sufficient for the average family. If      you live in a mild climate where temperature, seldom drop      to freezing, this system may be just right for you.    </p>        <p>      On the other hand-though I believe the cage is well      suited to Fig 1 backyard poultry-keeping in the more      temperate areas in the U.S.-it wasn't invented for      that purpose. I designed it the island of Mauritius (where      I served as a micro-farming specialist with the Peace      Corps) for use by the Rural Reconstruction Project, a      division of the Mauritian Economic Planning Unit.    </p>        <p>      Mauritius lies off the African coast to the east of      Madagascar, and its climate forced me to a compromise      between my own inclinations and the realities of life in      that latitude. Personally, I prefer to keep chickens in      roomy grow ground enclosures . . . but because of the      severity of coccidiosis in many tropical countries, such      confinement often proves less humane than the clean      environment of a cage.    </p>        <p class="caption">      Colony cage, complete with burlap blinds<br />      and egg shelf.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, I hate battery cages. To allow a bird      only enough room to stand and sit-without even space      to turn around-is incredibly cruel. The EPU colony      cage is, I think, by far preferable . . . and even offers a      few advantages over the admittedly more natural      surroundings of the conventional chicken run:    </p>    <p>      Fig 2    </p>        <p>      [1] Ease and economy of construction<br />      [2] Increased efficiency, which allows you more time for      other chores<br />      [3] High percentage of clean eggs, and tow incidence of      cracked or crushed shells<br />      [4] Prevention of roundworms and coccidiosis-that      nefarious chick killer-by means of the wire      floor<br />      [5] Easy collection of manure for use in the garden    </p>    <p>      Conversely, this system does give rise to a few problems      (which are, however, easily prevented):    </p>    <p>      [1] In some cases the birds' droppings won't dry fast      enough to avoid the breeding of flies. Manure should be      removed weekly when such pests are troublesome.    </p>    <p>      [2] Since limited space inclines chickens to cannibalism,      they should be debeaked (preferably before the onset of egg      production). This operation is easily done on a young bird      by removing the tip of the upper beak-just in front      of the pad-with a sharp knife, scissors, or side      cutters. (See Fig. 1.) To prevent bleeding and infection,      cauterize the wound by placing a hot knife against the cut      surface.    </p>    <p>      [3] The cage should be placed under shade to protect it      from direct sunlight when temperatures are high. This is      very important because the sheet-iron roof is an efficient      conductor of heat. On windy or rainy days, burlap bags can      be hung over the front of the coop. (According to some      interesting test results, higher egg production can be      maintained by protecting layers from wind . . .      particularly during the winter.)    </p>    <p>      Fig 3    </p>        <p class="caption">      Colony cage, complete with burlap blinds<br />      and egg shelf.    </p>    <p>      The colony cage shown in the plans with this article was      built from the following materials:    </p>    <p>      [1] Packing crate boards (for back, sides, removable      partition, central wall supports, and nest-box frame)    </p>    <p>      [2] Five eucalyptus poles (two 60-inch-long posts for the      front uprights, two 54-inchers for the back, and an 8-foot      roost pole)    </p>    <p>      [3] 50 feet of 1 X 3 lumber strips (frame)    </p>    <p>      [4] 8 feet of <em>heavy</em> wire mesh, 3/4-inch square or      3/4 X 1-inch rectangular (floor)    </p>    <p>      [5] 10 feet of 1/2-inch-square galvanized mesh . . . not      the flimsy round type (doors and nest-box floor)    </p>    <p>      [6] Two raisin crates (nest boxes)    </p>    <p>      [7] One sheet of galvanized iron, 8 feet by 3 feet (roof)    </p>    <p>      [8] 2-inch straight nails, 3/4-inch U nails, flat-headed      galvanized roofing nails, hinges    </p>    <p>      Here's how the "C" cage operates: Chicks are started in the      left-hand compartment. Newspaper placed on the floor and      topped with about 2 or 3 inches of wood shavings (crushed      corncobs, cane fiber, peanut shells, etc.) will provide a      soft absorbent litter to keep the young birds dry and      clean.    </p>            <p>      A cardboard box, prepared as shown in Fig. 2 and fitted      with a 60-watt electric light bulb, is placed in the rear      of the compartment . . . or a kerosene lamp, surrounded by      a wire basket chick-protector, can be substituted (see Fig.      3).    </p>    <p>      For seven to eight weeks the chicks are confined to the      lefthand section of the coop, provided with heat, and fed      from shallow troughs or pans of mash and water placed on      the litter near the door. After that the box can be taken      out, the partition removed, and the birds given the run of      the cage.    </p>    <p>      A good food container for older birds is a trough feeder      fitted on the inside of the middle door. By making this      unit deep and filling it only half full, you can reduce      wastage by beak-swinging hens. A simple gravity waterer is      excellent for this type of coop, since its large volume      ensures less work for you and plenty of clean, fresh water      for the flock.    </p>    <p>      The particular cage on which the plans are based was fitted      with a roost pole . . . which isn't absolutely necessary,      but pleases the hens and gets them off the cold wire at      night Such a pole should be painted twice with crankcase      oil, which has been diluted half-and-half with kerosene, to      protect the flock from bloodsucking mites.    </p>    <p>      The two nest boxes-which are adequate for 10 to 12      layers-must be kept darkened with a burlap blind to      encourage use by the hens (since birds seek privacy and      darkness at laying time). The 1/2-inch square mesh of the      nest floor gives a bit under the occupant's weight and      prevents the egg from cracking when it's dropped.    </p>    <p>      One disadvantage of the conventional henhouse is that eggs      often accumulate in the nests and are sat on and kept warm      when other hens enter the boxes. Naturally, the quality of      the layings deteriorates very quickly under these      conditions, and cracks and breakage often result In the "C"      cage, this problem is eliminated by a slanting nest-box      floor which rolls the freshly laid eggs to an open air      shelf. They cool quickly in that container and can be      gathered whenever their collection is convenient.    </p>    <p>      As the hens' production declines, the partition can be      replaced and preparations made for a new batch of chicks.    </p>    <p>      I've already pointed out, of course, that I don't regard      the above system as ideal . . . but where little space is      available, or ground enclosures are hazardous to a flock's      health, the colony cage is a workable and humane      alternative to the usual form of close confinement. Perhaps      some of MOTHER's readers will find it useful. Good farming!    </p>
