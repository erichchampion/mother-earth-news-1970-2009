            		    <p>      <strong>[1]</strong> Any king snakes you find around the      house and or barn should be encouraged. They'll eat a few      eggs or small chicks . . . but they also prey on      rattlesnakes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>[2]</strong> Most cats and dogs don't care for      snakes and will therefore alert you to such a creature's      presence. Dogs, however, often get bitten. Guinea hens are      supposed to be excellent "snakers" as well as top-notch      watch birds    </p>    <p>      <strong>[3]</strong> If you're walking in a      rattler-infested area, wear long trousers and knee-high      boots.    </p>    <p>      <strong>[4]</strong> Never put your hands under or into      anything if you can't see what else might be there.    </p>    <p>      <strong>[5]</strong> Carry-and use-a four or five-foot pole      to probe any brush or high grass you go through. The said      stick (or a frog gig) can also be very handy for banging      snakes to death or for pushing them away from you.    </p>		<p><strong>[6]</strong> Bullwhips (6-12 feet long) are most    effective reptile killers . . . if you're experienced in    their handling. Such a whip can be used for cutting, popping    or "roping" as with a lariat, but only after a lot of    practice.</p>    <p>      <strong>[7]</strong> Stop if you think you hear a rattler.      Stand absolutely still until you can see where the sound      comes from or otherwise ascertain whether or not there's a      snake nearby. Remember, though, this species doesn't always      give warning (and other pit vipers can't).    </p>    <p>      <strong>[8]</strong> If you spot one snake, watch for      another. I've seen plenty of rattlers and never more than      one at a time, but it's good to remember this old wives      tale . . . just in case.    </p>    <p>      <strong>[9]</strong> Out in the countryside, carry a      snakebite kit and know how to use it. Specific emergency      treatment is covered in most field manuals, survival guides      and first aid booklets.    </p>    <p>      <strong>[10]</strong> If the worst happens, stay cool and      don't panic. A rattler's bite usually isn't deadly . . .      but it's not to be taken lightly, either. Get treatment as      soon as possible<br />      <br />      <em>Shirly G.
