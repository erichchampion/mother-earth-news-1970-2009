        				        <p>      Our place is located approximately five miles from the      towns of Grass Valley and Nevada City, two of the earliest      and most important gold mining centers in California. We're      about two and a half hours' driving time from Oakland and      Berkeley and another 20 minutes from San Francisco,At our      elevation of about 3,000 feet,we have a foot or two of snow      in the winter (up to five feet in unusual years) and summer      temper-<br />      atures in the 90's.    </p>    <p>      The area-especially the towns-looks a lot like New England      and is the scene of most of my watercolors Although we had      a large vegetable garden-about half an acre-last year and      will continue to grow a good deal of our food, we don't      intend to farm for a livelihood. Most of our income is from      my free-lance work as a book designer and artist, done by      mail for clients in California, Colorado and Hawaii. I'd      expected to have only a modest amount of such employment      when we moved to the country but the fact is that I've had      to refuse assignments to leave myself time for other      activities. Ardis (a newcomer to the graphic arts) has      helped me on some of my jobs and says she enjoys even the      tedious chores. 		</p>		<div class="sidebar">    <p>		<strong>ON</strong> August 31, 1971, I resigned my job as      production assistant and book designer at the University of      California Press in Berkeley. We rented our house in Walnut      Creek (a suburb of Oakland) to a fellow employee and moved      to the old homestead where my wife, Ardis, grew up and      spent about half her life.    </p>		<p>      Other income-such as the rental for our home in Walnut      Creek and the selling price of the Grass Valley property      Ardis owned before we were married-pays for much of our      cost of living (lower here than in the city).Thus most of      our freelance earnings can be spent on building our new      home in the woods about eight miles from here.    </p>		</div>		<p>				Several years ago we bought nine and a      half acres bordering Tahoe National Forest, and in the      spring of 1970 acquireda tract of the same size that      adjoined our land on the south. That same year we had a      well drilled on the first parcel (located water at 85 feet      and carried on until we hit bedrock110 feet down). In 1971,      just before we moved up here, Ardis and I built a pump      house over the shaft and installed the pump, storage tank      and electrical generator. The flow from this system is      hardly impressive (about 1-1/3 gallons a minute or 80 an      hour) but it never falters . . . even after nine hours of      steady pumping. We've had water here when other wells went      dry. (Of course, we spent some time with pump experts      beforehand to design a setup that wouldn't drain the well      faster than it can fill. Happily, the right equipment the      smallest unit made-was also the least expensive.) Our 5 kw      generator, which is mounted on a trailer, was purchased      secondhand from a newspaper classified ad for $500 . . .      and will not only power the water pump but provide enough      electricity for our house both during and after      construction. </p><p>In the summer of 1972, George, Ardis'      next-to oldest son, converted the machine from gasoline to      propane. The conversion kit ($50.00 from the generator's      manufacturer) took about two hours to install and worked      perfectly on the first try. The propane is delivered by      truck and is the only utility for which we pay . . . all      others are derived from that source. The fuel is contained      in two tanks-one 300-gallon and one 150gallon-also      purchased through classified ads for less than half their      usual cost. Our heat will come from wood, of which we have      ample supplies.    </p>    <p>      The articles in MOTHER NO. 12 helped us buy a used pickup      truck at auction: not just what we want for the long run,      but the price was right and it'll hold us until we come      across the "perfect" vehicle. At another sale we found a      Jeep with a dozer blade on the front and a trench digger on      the back. (That's a great machine, by the way: In one pass      it can carve out a ditch a foot wide and up to five feet      deep.) George and his younger brother Mark kept the Jeep      busy a good part of the summer digging foundations, leach      lines and utility and road ditches . . . even the hole for      the septic tank. One of those trenches is 300 feet long and      will carry a plastic waterline from a reservoir (a $40.00      plastic swimming pool with a 12-foot diameter and a      capacity of 2,500 gallons) to a tent-cabin we built in a      couple of weekends. That shelter will be part of a      permanent campground for friends who want to visit during      the summer months. We also put up another pool of the same      kind to cool off in, and to serve as an emergency water      supply in case of fire. It takes our well about 36 hours to      fill each of the reservoirs.    </p>    <p>      Although we finally have a building permit for the house      and managed to pry the plans away from the architect last      week, it's already November as I write and too late to do      anything this year. We've had 13 inches of rain since the      beginning of October and the roads to our property are      unpaved for the last five miles . . . which makes it pretty      hard for a concrete mixer to get in and out. Even if we did      the mixing ourselves we couldn't haul that much rock and      sand (particularly over one stretch which is solid clay for      a couple of hundred feet). We've tried to improve this      section by putting in drainage ditches, but the rain      started before we could finish and that, too, will have to      wait for next year.    </p>    <p>      Our house-to-be is hexagonal, raised one story off the      ground on telephone poles. Underneath, at the center, is a      core containing a workshop and laundry room. Still under      the house and extending away from this area-like a pointing      finger-is an enclosed stairway and storage unit. The stairs      bring you up into the middle of the hexagon where a hall      opens onto each of the rooms (all more or less pie-shaped).      Each room, in turn, has a sliding glass door leading to the      deck that surrounds the outside of the house. To the south,      an exterior stairway leads doom to the ground.    </p>    <p>      We had a time locating used telephone poles, but eventually      picked up about half as many as we needed from here and      there. Then we learned that Nevada City was undergrounding      its utilities, removing the poles from the main street and      installing gaslights in their place. (Grass Valley is now      doing the same . . . both communities have      economic-development grants from the federal government for      this project, which is supposed to make the towns more      attractive to tourists!) Ardis checked and found that the      procedure is as follows: [ 1 ] The electric company first      removes its wires. Then the telephone company [2] takes out      its lines and poles and [3] gives away the latter because      it has no license to sell them (or anything other than      phone services). To make a long story short, the telephone      people cut the poles in two and gave the lower (stronger)      halves to us and the tops to folks who wanted them for      fencepost's. The utility even delivered the timbers to our      house while we were on vacation in Canada.    </p>    <p>      This year, then, we're all set to start actual      construction. We plan to do the work ourselves, although I      can see from the results of this season that I'll have to      turn away jobs during the summer months in order to have      enough time. Our garden, like the business, has been an      unqualified success. Ardis experimented with drying many      foods, all with good results. I need to design and build      her some better equipment, though: So far she's had to make      do with netting stretched across my surplus picture frames.      She then covers the netting with the fruits and vegetables      to be dried and suspends the loaded frames in the attic.      One of her projects was to slice thousands of pounds-I'm      sure-of zucchini and reduce them to no more than three or      four pounds of dried slivers. Cooked up with some other      dried, canned or frozen vegetables, they're a very      satisfying dish and look just like fresh squash (although      the texture is a little more on the chewy side).    </p>    <p>      Last year we grew popcorn for the first time. The kernels      that do pop are delicious, and even those that don't are      good eating . . . easy to chew, like nuts, and not      tooth-crackers like the leftovers from the commercial      product.    </p>    <p>      We also planted three 50-foot rows of soybeans. The beans      are good, all right, but what a job to harvest and prepare      that many by hand! Although each of us pitched in for a few      hours now and then, Ardis worked hardest of all to get the      crop picked, shelled and dried. (The rains and frosts      arrived before most of the pods had cured naturally, so we      had trays of beans in the ovens and all over the heaters      for a couple of weeks.) We'll have to figure out a better      way to deal with that vegetable: Dried soybeans, as Ardis      likes to remind me, are only 294 a pound at Nevada City's      natural food store.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of heaters, we swear by our Aladdin kerosene      burners. We now own five . . . all purchased at garage      sales, many new or practically new, from people who didn't      know how to use them properly. When correctly adjusted,      they burn with a silent, practically odorless blue flame      and put out a lot of heat. They're also safer than most      other portable heaters (including electric), use cheap fuel      and can serve as cook stoves.    </p>    <p>      Last week I enclosed the front porch with a double layer of      6mil plastic sheeting and installed a second glass door at      the outer edge of the porch by the steps. Then I lit a      kerosene heater and set a gallon ketchup can full of water      on top. Result: a greenhouse, which provides a place for      our tomatoes, camellias, ferns, gardenias, lemon tree, etc.      When we come home on a cold wintry evening, the porch      light-diffused by the double plastic walls-gives us a      cheery welcome . . . which becomes a warm one when we step      inside.    </p>    <p>      I put an automatic closer on the outside door of the      greenhouse as I did on the back door last winter. With so      many people going in and out with their arms or hands full,      it saves not only heat but dispositions as well. As you can      imagine, what I've told you is only a part of everything      that's been going on. To tell it all I'd have to write a      book (and someday I will . . . but later, when I have more      time and perspective). Right now I'll close and go see what      surprise the mailman has brought for us.    </p>    <p>      Copyright © 2001-2002, Ogden Publications, Inc.<br />      All rights reserved.    </p>
