                        <h3>      HORSE ...    </h3>    <p>      <strong>In</strong> spite of the teachings of the      no-digging and no-ploughing school of husbandmen, people      still go on digging and ploughing, as they have done ever      since Neolithic times, and my guess is that they will go on      digging and ploughing as long as men live on this earth.      For there is really no other way of effectively growing      arable crops-at least, without the impracticable use of      enormous quantities of compost.    </p>    <p>      Cobbett says, in Cottage Economy: 'As to the act of making      bread, it would be shocking indeed if that had to be taught      by means of books.' I would like to paraphrase that: 'as to      the act of digging'. The only thing I will say about it,      realizing that the flight from the cities is likely to      include people who have practically never seen a spade, is      that you should nearly always dig a trench: that is, remove      one spit of soil (a spit is the wedge of soil cut by the      spade) out in a furrow right across your piece of ground      and dump it, then turn the next row of spits upside down      into the furrow you have left. Thus you always have an open      furrow in front of you to invert your spits into. When you      come to the end of your piece you should, in theory at      least, load the first lot of spits you dug out and dumped      into a wheelbarrow and cart them back to fill up the empty      furrow that has been left.    </p>    <p>      One way is to split your work down the middle and dig from      alternate ends. You can then throw the first spit of each      long narrow strip into the last furrow of the other. It is      often admissible, however, to dig by inverting the spits in      situ and not 'digging to a trench' when you are digging      land over for the second time, or just loosening the soil      around soft fruit bushes, or digging with a fork. But the      serious self-supporter is likely to be more interested in      growing food than in such counsels of perfection. But, in      my experience at any rate, the more you dig the better, and      it is better to dig badly than not dig at all.    </p>    <p>      If we wish to grow food on a larger scale, then there are      three things we can do effectively. One is to buy an      agricultural tractor. The other is go in for one of those      little garden cultivators: either a rotovator or a      mini-plough. The third is to plough by horse.    </p>    <h3>      TRACTOR ...    </h3>    <p>      <strong>In</strong> comparing these different methods of      cultivating I will merely draw on my own experience. We      have now a Ferguson diesel tractor which cost us $180.00      together with a fore-end loader, a link box, and a mounted      spring-tine cultivator. For $180.00 we could not have got      much of a garden cultivator which you can comfortably lift      off the ground with one hand. We can always borrow from a      neighbor a two-furrow plough to fit on the tractor (a good      secondhand one from a farm sale would cost us about 25      dollars), and we could certainly plough very deeply.and      well five acres in a day (if we were willing to spend a      whole day doing one job, which we are not). This tractor      will break up rough ground and bury any amount of rubbish      as it ploughs; if it hits a boulder in our boulder-strewn      glacial deposit of a farm, it just stops the tractor, and      if the boulder is no bigger than I am it will lift it right      out of the ground with its hydraulics. The spring-tine      cultivator covers a lot of ground, therefore it is easy to      make many passes with it, and it will pulverize the      roughest soil and make a seed-bed. Or almost make a      seed-bed-it is generally desirable to haul a set of light      harrows, or a ring-roll, over the land after it, to make      the tilt fine enough for small seeds. The tractor will work      in a small garden both with the plough and the spring-tine      cultivator-so long as the garden is quite empty of crops      and unencumbered. It becomes difficult when there are      patches of crop left which must be undisturbed, for the      tractor takes room to maneuver.    </p>    <p>      I must explain here that Harry Ferguson revolutionized      tractor work when he invented the three-point linkage      (which has now been adopted on most tractors), and for the      first time made it possible to use tractors in confined      areas of ground. Hitherto a tractor hauled a set of plough      shares mounted on wheels-like a kind of cumbersome      gun-carriage being dragged along behind the tractor. The      ploughs could (in some cases) be lifted out of the ground      by locking the carrying bar to the wheels so that the      turning of the wheels lifted the ploughs up into the air,      and then the tractor could be turned fairly easily. But      even so it was difficult to plough the headlands,      impossible to plough into the corners, and impossible to      plough right up against the hedge.    </p>    <p>      The three-point linkage changed all this, and made the big      tractor a possible implement for using in small gardens.      The plough was now mounted on three arms which stuck out of      the back of the tractor, two of them activated by the      hydraulics. Wheels are dispensed with, and the equipment is      compact in the extreme. By pulling a lever the driver can      whip the ploughs right out of the ground when it is easy to      back the tractor into any odd corner and plough right up      into the hedge. Most other implements can be three point      mounted too, and thus used with the same ease and      maneuverability. The three-point linkage undoubtedly saved      what was left of the hedges of England, for it made it easy      to plough right up to a hedge. In the old dragged-plough      days ploughing small fields was intolerable, and farmers      were bulldozing out their hedges to knock small fields into      bigger ones as fast as they could. Now this process has      been slowed down at any rate, if not stayed.    </p>    <p>      As to the costs, and general bother, of the big tractor, I      have sorrowfully to report that my machine has cost me over      its purchase price already in repairs. Being a diesel it is      hard to start: if not used frequently its batteries get      flat and the high compression engine is very hard to turn.      I either have to leave it on top of a hill and run it down      to start it, or else use a jump-lead from my car battery,      and it canes that. Alternatively I take the tractor      batteries out (and they are very heavy!) and put them on      charge with a trickle-charger (yes, we now are on the      electric mains). As for fuel oil for the diesel, to run it      economically, in Britain at least, you will have to use      duty-free oil. To obtain this you will either have to have      your own large storage tank, or else buy at cost price from      neighboring farmers. Diesel fuel you buy in garages is      taxed, and nearly twice the money. But our tractor has many      uses. It ploughs both field and large garden, it harrows      the pastures, it hauls firewood from the forest, it cuts      grass for hay, it turns and tedders the hay, it carries the      bales, it pulls a muck-spreader that we borrow from a      neighbor when we have a lot of muck to spread, or when we      have a little it carries that little in its link-box-a kind      of scoop that fits on to the three-point linkage. The      fore-end loader has a fork attachment which will load muck      into a muck-spreader very quickly indeed, or a dozer      attachment which can be used for leveling land.    </p>    <p>      If you have anything over an acre of arable land it might      well pay to get a big tractor, if you can buy one cheap. It      might well pay to get a petrol-paraffin, or 'T.V.O.' one,      for these are much easier to start (you can swing them by      hand) and if they do cost a little more for fuel, well how      much fuel will you use anyway on a small place? In using a      farm tractor on a smallholding you are using a sledgehammer      to crack a nut, but if you can get a sledgehammer for the      price of a nut-cracker-and it does the job equally well or      better-then maybe it is worth it. Our present holding is      seventy acres, so, in the absence of time to do our work      with horses; we need a large tractor.<br />    </p>    <h3>      GARDEN CULTIVATOR ...    </h3>        <p>      Garden cultivators are a different thing altogether. The      kind that pull ploughshares-unless they are very heavy      ones-I would discount. They plough but I don't believe they      plough very well. The rotovator kind are of two types. One,      like the Howard, pulls itself along by its wheels and stirs      the soil by means of the rotovator. Others, like the      Merrytiller, have no power-driven wheels while they are      rotovating, but shove themselves along with the rotovator      itself.    </p>    <p>      The latter are harder work to handle but I believe they do      a better job if you are comparing machines of the same      size. The Merrytiller type of machine is excellent for      inter-row cultivation, for keeping land clean between soft      fruit trees, and for the initial clearing of small areas of      ground. It is nimble, handy and cheap. The bigger      wheel-propelled machines like the Howard are better for      working large areas of land.    </p>    <p>      The consumption of fuel for all these machines is almost      negligible, but the amount of ground they can get over in a      day is comparatively small. To use them on a field scale is      tedious beyond belief, and they make an awful lot of noise.      If you like to hear the birds sing while you work (and for      me that is very important) they are not for you.    </p>    <h3>      HORSE ...    </h3>        <p>      And so we come to the horse, and here many people who have      not worked with horses, or seen them working, will say 'how      absurd! You might as well go back to ploughing with oxen!'      Well I have ploughed with oxen, and would very much like to      do so again and may one day.    </p>    <p>      There is nothing wrong with ploughing with oxen at all. And      as for horses-they have a great deal to be said for them.    </p>    <h3>      PLOUGHING...    </h3>    <p>      With two good horses it is possible to plough an acre of      moderate land in a day. Your fuel need cost you nothing (at      least nothing that has to come from outside the farm), you      can hear the birds sing as you work, and will not be      working in diesel or petrol fumes, and, if you have a good      rapport with your horses, ploughing can be a delight. I      don't believe there is a more entrancing occupation. And      there is one little thing that a horse can do that a      tractor can't, and that is to have another horse. A mare      can work in chains (although not in shafts) to within a few      hours of foaling. She foals in the spring, so can work the      winter through, which is when you want to do your      ploughing. After she has had her foal she must rest for six      weeks at least, and then only come into her work gradually.    </p>    <p>      Now one horse will not plough an acre a day, nor will he      plough very deep, or plough very rough ground.      Nevertheless, one horse can very well do the cultivations      of a smallholding. If the ground is too rough to put the      plough into it, put pigs on it. They will pioneer the way      for your one-horse plough for you. A horse will plough land      very well that has not been allowed to go too far, but long      tussocky grass, tough old pasture too coarse for sheep to      graze down properly or rough grass between apple trees,      your one-horse plough will not man use pigs, then get a      contractor in with a big tractor. And then, when your land      has been initially bust-up, keep it bust-up-by ploughing      and ploughing with your one horse, or dragging through it      such harrows and cultivators as you can lay your hands on.      Keep 'pulling of it about': grass is the enemy of the      plough: don't let it come back.    </p>    <p>      The kind of horse plough that we use nowadays, when we do      use a horse plough (and one is very useful for row-crop      work even if you have got a tractor), is the Brabant. We      bought ours in Spain. This is a wheeled turning plough, or      one-way plough, with no handles. You don't have to hold it,      it steers itself as long as the horse walks in the furrow.      All you have to do is turn it round at the headland and      swing the shares over, so as to turn the furrow the other      way. As the plough is also turned the other way that means      that you go back ploughing the same way. Ploughing with a      one way plough, whether by horse or by tractor, is much      easier and demands less skill than ploughing with a      fixed-furrow plough. But if you try ploughing with a      fixed-furrow plough you will see the difficulty      immediately, and have to set about finding a way round it.      You must plough a furrow, then turn round and plough      another furrow against the first. You then go round and      round this, each time ploughing another furrow towards your      first two furrows: gathering the stetch as ploughmen say.      When you think you've gone far enough you can start another      stetch by laying out another top-in other words, going to      one side into unploughed ground and ploughing two more      virgin furrows leaning up against each other. The Horse in      the Fur row, by George Ewart Evans (Faber and Faber), is      the best book I have ever found dealing with this      complicated subject, but no book in the world can beat half      an hour's instruction from an old horseman. Good ploughing      with horses is a highly skilled and technical job, and it      takes years to learn to do it properly, but anybody can      scratch away with a plough well enough to turn his land      over somehow or other. Perfection will come with time.    </p>    <p>      Other implements you can pull with a horse are many and      various. A ring-roll or Cambridge roll is a very good thing      to have; the rings can be bought separately and made up to      any width required. Cultivators, scufflers, expanding      horseshoes and steerage hoes come in great variety. An      implement I like is the old fashioned hoop-hoe, which any      blacksmith can make. The spring toothed harrow is a      marvelous implement. A tractor normally tows a gang of      these: a horse will easily pull just one member of the gang      and you can adjust the depth at which the tines go down      into the soil. These spring-toothed harrows are easy of      draught and marvelous at pulling down clods and getting a      seed bed, and you can often get them at farm sales.    </p>    <p>      Digging by hand, or hoeing by hand, are immensely slow and      laborious jobs. Cobbett, writing in 1820, claimed that a      man could dig with the spade twelve rods a day. A modern      man could not dig anything like so much, and 1 am fairly      certain that no man reared in a city could do a quarter of      it. A one-horse plough might very well do half an acre in a      day, or eighty rods. That is the difference. As for hoeing,      the difference is far greater: what would take a week to      hand-hoe can be done in an hour or two with a horse-hoe.      But mark, you will also have to hand-hoe your row crops in      the end no matter how many times you horse or tractor hoe      them. This is because no mechanical device can get in      between the plants in the rows, nor tell the difference      between a- weed and a plant. But a working horse lightens      the job of husbandry enormously; he really enables you to      get on top of your holding. As to where you can get all      these horse implements: well, up to now, farm sales have      been the answer. Up until 1970 anyway you could get      practically any horse implement you wanted, in Britain at      least, for a few shillings. Now people are beginning to buy      up horse ploughs to stick up outside pubs and the market is      wearing thin. Ireland, incidentally, is a richer source of      old horse tools than is England, and in France or Belgium      you can still get anything you want in this line new:      although God help you when you try to get it through the      British customs.    </p>    <h3>      HARNESS...    </h3>    <p>      One thing you have to have with a horse, of course, is      harness. This you used to be able to buy up at farm sales      for a few pennies or sometimes get for nothing; now if it      is any. good it is snapped up and hung on a pub wall. You      can get good harness, new or secondhand, on the Continent      still, or in Eire, and Spain makes some of the best harness      in the world, and the cheapest. The imagination boggles at      trying to get past the British customs though. If you can      use a needle you can do a lot in the way of repairing old      harness, but if the leather has perished then it is      useless. Harness hung up on pub walls for a year or two is      ruined: one thing leather can't stand is drying out.      Harness must have oil: not too much but enough. In South      Africa we used to use mutton fat, and it worked very well.      In Britain people generally use neat's foot oil. You should      oil or grease the grain side-that is the rough inside of      the leather, but wash the polished outside of the leather      with water and saddle soap. It seems a general rule that      animal fats and oils are better for animal products,      vegetable for vegetable (e.g., linseed oil for cricket      bats) and mineral for mineral (e.g., mineral oil for motor      cars). Wet is the enemy of leather, but oil keeps it out.      Heat is a worse enemy: to dry harness on a radiator is to      kill it stone dead.    </p>    <p>      You must get somebody to show you how to put the harness on      the horse. There are certain principles that have to be      considered. Forward power is transmitted from the horse by      the tugs (see Fig. 2). If the horse is working in chains      (i.e., pulling a plough or such instrument) the chains go      straight to the collar, from a whippletree. The latter is a      'spreader' of wood or iron that keeps the chains apart so      that they don't pinch the horse. A back-strap can go over      the horse's back to keep the chains from sagging and      getting under his hind legs when he stops. This strap      should be long enough to allow the chains to be straight      when the horse is pulling. When the horse is in shafts the      ridge pad (like a saddle) supports the ridge chain which      holds the shafts up and also takes any weight which is on      the shafts owing to a two-wheeled cart being front-heavy.      The girth strap goes under the belly of the horse to      prevent the cart falling over backwards if it is      back-heavy. The britchin goes round the horse's buttocks      and is chained on to the shafts to keep the cart back if      the horse is going downhill, or to back the cart. So with      shafts there are just three chains to hook on one side of      the horse, and two the other. The order of hooking them on      ('shutting the horse in' or 'putting him in') is: go to the      off side (right side) of the horse, hook the tug on, throw      the ridge chain over, hook the britchin chain on. Go to the      other side-hook the ridge chain on, then the britchin. See      that the britchin is not too tight so that it worries the      horse, but is not too slack either, for if it is the front      of the cart will shove against the horse's backside when      you go downhill and annoy him. See that the shafts are a      comfortable height and length and don't pinch the horse, or      poke him in the face when you are turning. If the tugs are      correctly adjusted you should be able to produce an      imaginary line from them, going backwards, and this line      should pass through the hubs of the wheels. I don't think      anybody should try to harness a horse unless they have been      shown how but if you have to, remember that you must take      the ham off the collar, or at least loosen them, and put      the collar on upside down, and then reverse it and put the      hames on. Generally you must do this with the bridle off      the horse, or the collar won't go on over it.    </p>    <h3>      FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT ...    </h3>    <p>      With the little work you will have to do on a very small      holding, if the horse gets plenty of grass, you will hardly      have to feed him at all. When the horse is not working he      will live on grass alone, and don't give him too rich grass      either (particularly if he is a pony) or he will get ill.      In the winter, if grass is short, you must give him more or      less hay according to how much grass there is. If you work      a horse at all hard you must give him other things besides      grass. Hay is better than all-grass for a working horse.      Grass makes a horse soft. Hay keeps him hard. The hay must      be good if you feed it to horses: dusty or mouldy hay is      dangerous. All-clover hay is bad too, except for nursing      mothers. Oat straw can be a substitute for hay, and I have      fed horses most successfully on oats in the sheaf: that is      one sheaf a day of unthreshed oats. They eat it straw,      corn, and all. O.M.C.S. (Old Mother Common Sense) will tell      you to take the string out.    </p>    <p>      If the horse is working hard though you must pay him with      oats, crushed maize or other corn. A big plough horse,      working a full day, needs as much as 20 Lbs. of oats or      other corn a day. For light work perhaps half that. A cob,      say of 5 feet, would do with perhaps three or five pounds      for light work, ten for heavy continuous work, plus hay,      and/or straw. Bran is also good. Eight to ten pounds of hay      is about right, with no grass: less with grass. Feeding      should be at least three times a day, and the horse should      be given plenty of time to eat: at least a full hour. A      working horse should be groomed once a day. When the horse      is not working he should not have corn, or if he does only      a very little. If you rest a hard-working horse you must      knock off his corn, otherwise he will get ill.    </p>    <p>      You must shoe your horse about once every six weeks,      whether you are working him or not. If you turn him out to      grass for a long period you had better pull the shoes off      him: if you leave them on, his feet will go on growing      under the shoes and he will go lame. Shoeing is a highly      skilled job and no unskilled person should tackle it. The      demand for the service of shoeing smiths is now insatiable,      in Britain at least, and this is a very good and profitable      profession for a young man to go in for. You get two pounds      per horse, and should easily be able to do ten in a day:      twenty pounds a working day and no rat-race is not to be      sneezed at: see if you can earn that by getting a degree in      philosophy.    </p>    <h3>      BREEDING ...    </h3>    <p>      The profitability of the smallholding horse can be      increased enormously if she is a good mare, and used for      breeding as well as work. Your mare may do any work for the      first six or seven months of pregnancy: then she should      only work in chains, for the shafts are uncomfortable for      her. She can be worked, with advantage to her health, right      up to foaling: many a mare has dropped her foal in the      field in which she has been ploughing, with no ill results.    </p>    <p>      After foaling the mare should be pampered a bit: a nice      warm bran mash for example, some oats, and she should be      turned out on to good fresh grass: if possible on which no      horses have been grazing for some time. She should not be      worked at all for at least six weeks, and then only be      given very light work for a few hours a day up to the time      of weaning. Before weaning she should not be kept away from      the foal for more than two or three hours. Weaning can be      at four months, but the later the better for the foal. When      you wean the foal you must keep him out of hearing of the      mare, on very good pasture, and then start working the mare      as hard as you like to help dry her milk off. Good summer      grass is ample for the foal, but when the first winter      comes you should give him perhaps a couple of pounds of      crushed oats and three or four pounds a day of good hay. If      you want a gelding get the vet, or a wise man, to come and      castrate him at about a year old, when the weather has      become milder after the winter but before the flies are      about. Foals on pasture should have their hoofs rasped down      every so often, so that the frog (the soft bit in the      middle) just rests on the ground.    </p>    <p>      The sooner you halter-break the foal the better. Get a rope      halter on at a few days old, and teach the foal to be led      and not be afraid of people. Get him used to having his      feet lifted. You can begin to break him for work in his      second summer (one assumes he was born in the spring).      Breaking should be a gradual but firm process. Keep him in      for a time (nothing tames a horse, or gets him used to      humans, so much as being kept inside), handle him a lot,      get him used to wearing harness, trotting round on a      leading rein (if you are going to ride him he should have a      mouthing bit and a breaking harness for a week or two),      then try him in chains in front of something that doesn't      matter, such as a set of harrows.    </p>    <h3>      PASTURE ...    </h3>    <p>      Horses living out don't want very good fattening pasture.      It is bad for them. The wider range of grazing they have      the better, and they do not thrive on land where only      horses are kept. They do far better running out either      with, or after, cattle. A horse kept out all the time and      worked occasionally and lightly is most unlikely to get      ill. One worked hard and continuously must be stabled and      fed 'high', and it takes a skilled horseman to keep him fit      and working. You are being forced to keep him unnaturally,      i.e., on food that is richer than his digestion was evolved      to cope with. But a horse out on grass should give you very      little trouble, if any at all.    </p>    <h3>      BUYING A HORSE ...    </h3>    <p>      There is no mystery about this-if you want to do really      heavy work, perhaps till a farm of fifty or a hundred acres      or more with horses, you will have to buy proper heavy      horses, Shires, Clydesdales, Percherons or Suffolks.      Personally I should never have any hesitation-I should      plump for Suffolks. They are the kindest, most noble, and      most beautiful animals that ever walked. But if you just      want to pull a one-horse plough get a good strong cob. Go      to a horse sale and buy one, or to a good dealer who won't      cheat you. Have a vet look at him first if you feel like      it. At a reputable horse sale animals are 'sold sound'-that      is you have a come-back if there is anything wrong with the      animal. Do not, until you are an expert, buy a horse from      anybody but a man with a reputation to lose unless you have      the animal vetted. If you are a beginner buy a fairly old      horse already broken and trained. You don't want both to be      learners. If you have a good horse, and are kind to him,      and work a lot with him, you will get very fond of him and      he will of you. He will be a source of great pleasure to      you. He will be pleased to see you and will try to please      you. And he will cultivate your large garden or small      fields as well as any tractor and better in many ways.    </p>    <p>      To compare the pros and cons of these three main sources of      power on the smallholding, farm tractors, garden      cultivators and horses, we end up with this: A secondhand      farm tractor is immensely good value for what it is,      because a tractor that is too old for a full-size farm is      not too old for doing occasional odd-jobs on a      smallholding, and also that sometimes the government      subsidizes farmers who buy new tractors whereupon they sell      their old ones long before they need to.    </p>        <p>      It will cope with any of the cultivation jobs in the field,      will cultivate even in fair-sized gardens, but is not as      good as either garden cultivator or horse at doing row-crop      work or working in confined spaces. Any fool can use it.      The garden cultivator may cost as much, new, as an old farm      tractor, and beware of getting an old garden cultivator      unless you know that there is a very good reason for its      being for sale. They wear out. It is infinitely slower than      a farm tractor, won't really plough (unless it is a very      big one), is fine for row crops, no good for transporting      things, and any fool can use it.    </p>    <p>      The horse costs about as much as the secondhand farm      tractor or the new garden cultivator. If you have enough      land you can feed him for nothing, and if she is a mare she      may give you foals. These can be a very valuable export      item. A horse will cover ground much more slowly than a      farm tractor but much faster than a garden cultivator. He      is very good for row crops and for transport. Working with      a horse can be a delight but the horseman must be a      sensitive and intelligent man. The horse is no tool for      fools, and no fool can use him.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Come all ye honest ploughmen<br />      Old England's fate you hold<br />      Who labour in the winter time<br />      In stormy winds and cold<br />      To clothe our fields in plenty<br />      Our farmyards to renew<br />      That bread may not be wanting<br />      Behold the painful plough!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The townsman in his turmoil<br />      The gentleman at ease<br />      Forget the gal/ant sailor<br />      Who ploughs the raging seas<br />      But we do give him sustenance<br />      And this he knows be true<br />      He sails upon the Ocean<br />      By virtue of the Plough. 9</em>    </p>    <hr />    <p>      Copyright © 2001-2002, Ogden Publications, Inc.<br />      All rights reserved.    </p>
