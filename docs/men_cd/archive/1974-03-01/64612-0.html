        One version of Mother's little urban car will be powered by a DC electric motor. The drive unit, in turn, will derive its energy from batteries and those batteries will be charged by a wind-driven generator. Later, a parabolic collector may be used to focus the sun's rays enough to heat water and produce steam. The vapor will then be used to operate a steam engine which will be harnessed to an electrical generator to charge the batteries to drive the car.
