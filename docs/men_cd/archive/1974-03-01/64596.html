                		<hr />    <p>      I'd like to share with <strong><em>MOTHER's</em></strong>      readers a few comments on Jack Widmer's "Homestead Hog      Production" <em><strong>(MOTHER N0.      23).</strong></em><br />      In that excerpt the author recommended breeding a sow twice      a year. From the standpoint of economy-which is not      necessarily "automated farming" it's better to do so three      times a year (ideally so she'll farrow in December, April      and August). A female hog is quite capable of producing      three litters annually if the pigs are pre-started and      weaned at 10-20 days. Also, as the sow matures, she gets      fatter and fatter until she's eating more than she returns.      If full use is made of her reproductive life, expenses stay      down, profit from the sale of weanlings rises and the      homesteader can afford to buy gilts when his brood animals      get too heavy.<br />      <br />      Although Widmer is correct in saying that one breeding is      usually enough, the chances of a larger litter are      increased if you allow two services within 24 hours. Never      hurry your boar some need 15 minutes for complete      ejaculation. (Young males, by the way, should be started on      gilts. A first encounter with a mature, aggressive sow can      result in low libido and hurt the boar's reproductive      efficiency.)<br />      <br />      The gestation period for swine is 112-115 days. If the      homesteader will memorize the phrase "three months, three      weeks and three days", he won't need that chart on pg. 71      to check his sows' farrowing dates. I don't mean to      suggest, however, that record keeping (heat periods,      breeding dates, birth dates and weights, etc.) isn't      important. It is, unless you're just raising a barrow or      two for meat.    </p>    <p>      Because sow milk is low in iron, just-farrowed pigs have a      propensity toward anemia. To avoid this the mother's teats      can be painted with an iron solution, or the litter      injected with a compound of that metal or iron-bearing soil      can be out in the farrowing pen for the young to root      through. No, you won't be "pumping 'em full of chemicals"!      Iron is a necessary trace mineral.<br />      <br />      If you have no electricity for heat lamps in the winter, be      sure to keep your new pigs warm and out of drafts.<br />      <br />      During their first week, young boars should have their      canine or needle teeth clipped off with wire-cutting pliers      prevent the males from later injuring your other swine as      they grow older). Be sure to cut cleanly and leave no      splinters. Ear notching for record purposes should be done      at the same time if you're going to do it at all.<br />      <br />      Whatever the age of your hogs, you'll get better daily      gains and feed conversions if the animals always have cool,      clean water to drink. The troughs that hold the supply      should ;a cleaned at least twice a week. Don't force your      stock to survive on old mud puddles!<br />      <br />      Let me repeat, finally, that the production of fast-growng      pigs which make the best gain on the least feed isn't      automated farming" at all. To get the most of an animal      resource by using the least of a plant resource is an      ecologically sound principle    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Copyright Â© 2001-2002, Ogden Publications, Inc.<br />      All rights reserved.    </p>
