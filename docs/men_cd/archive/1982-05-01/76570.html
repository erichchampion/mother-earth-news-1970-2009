                        <p>      STAFF PHOTO    </p>    <p>      <em>Helen and Scott Nearing are light-years ahead of most      of us when it comes to living a life of voluntary      simplicity in harmony with nature. Back in 1932 they began      homesteading a run-down farm in Vermont's Green Mountains,      and later-when the slopes around them exploded into      ski resorts in the early 50's- Helen and Scott moved      to a rocky inlet on the Maine coast. . . and started all      over again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>That's where you'll find the Nearings today: They're      still clearing brush, still building the stone structures      they're famous for, and still raising most of their      vegetarian diet themselves in productive wholistic gardens      . . . just as they've been doing for 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally, the Nearings have learned a good deal about      homesteading over the years . . . and they've agreed to      share that knowledge with MOTHER'S readers in a regular      question-and-answer column. Send your queries about      self-reliant living on the land to Helen and Scott Nearing,      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70, Henderson-ville.      North Carolina 28791. Please don't expect personal replies,      though. The most frequently asked questions will be      answered here-and here only-so that we can all      benefit from what the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>    <p>      Have you taken any "survivalist" precautions (such as      stocking up on food products, weapons, and essential      household supplies) in preparation for a coming economic      and/ or social collapse? Why or why not? I'd be interested,      too, in hearing your views about what will happen to our      society in the next 50 years.    </p>    <p>      Our "survivalist precautions" were begun 50 years ago, when      we made the decision to go back to the land. We did then      what the early settlers did: We stocked up on grains and      staples . . . dried and canned many vegetables and fruits .      . . and stored the tins, jars, and barrels of edibles in a      dry cellar. Today we continue to follow these steps toward      food self-sufficiency. We own no weapons (except a fly      swatter and a mousetrap, which we use with great reluctance      and only on extreme provocation). In addition, we've      invested in plenty of indoor and outdoor tools and have      taken good care of them over the years. These are the only      "precautions" we feel are necessary to battle whatever ills      the future may hold. As to our predictions for the next 50      years, we believe that nuclear weapons will at some point      be used, causing the loss of human and animal life on much      of our planet. The immediate future holds-at      best-worsening economic problems.    </p>    <p>      I've enjoyed reading, and I've been inspired by, your books      on how you've achieved the "good life" . . . and I've been      especially interested in the material on building with      stone. However, as a beginning homesteader and novice      carpenter/bricklayer, I need a more detailed outline of the      process. Could you recommend a good sourcebook or two on      stone housebuilding?    </p>    <p>      We know two excellent books that follow our methods of      construction: <em>How to Build a Low-Cost House of      Stone</em> by Sharon and Lewis Watson, and <em>Build Your      Own Stone House</em> by Karl Schwenke. Both volumes can be      found at public libraries or a good bookstore. We also      recommend <em>The Owner-Builder's Guide to Stone      Masonry</em> by Ken Kern, Steve Magers, and Lou Penfield.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: You can order</em> The Owner-Builder's      Guide to Stone Masonry- <em>for $11.95 plus 95 cents      shipping and handling-from Mother's Bookshelf(restricted),      P.O. Box 70, Hender-sonville, North Carolina 28791.]</em>    </p>    <p>      I'm a long-time admirer of your views and lifestyle, and      have read your books on homesteading. One question,      however, remains unanswered for me. With such rich and      bounteous gardens and only two mouths to feed (I gather      that your guests come and go rather sporadically), how are      you able to consume all the fresh produce? Finding creative      ways to serve and preserve my garden harvest has always      been more of a problem for me than growing it, and I'd      appreciate any suggestions you might have.    </p>    <p>      We've reduced our garden space from 10,000 square feet to      2,500 square feet. . . but even this smaller plot provides      us with more produce than we can consume. So-after      filling our cellar with canned, frozen, boxed, and binned      vegetables for winter use-we give away or barter with      the surplus.    </p>    <p>      There are chapters in <em>Living the Good Life and      Continuing the Good Life</em> -as well as in Helen's      new Simple Food cookbook-which detail our methods of      winter storage (write to the Social Science Institute,      Dept. TMEN, Harborside, Maine 04642 for ordering      information on all our publications).    </p>    <p>      It's great that some people can achieve a degree of      self-sufficiency by rural homesteading . . . but what steps      do you suggest that urban (and happily so) folks like me      take in order to be more self-reliant?    </p>    <p>      You seem to like the city and intend to stay in an urban      environment. If that's the case, you can try to eat whole,      nutritious foods from health food stores and from fruit and      vegetable markets . . . or, better yet, grow your own      crops, if you've got access to a bit of land where you can      do so. We've stayed in cities over a large part of the      world, and have generally tried to avoid restaurants and      cooked food when doing so. Instead, we always seek out the      open-air markets where fresh produce is brought in from the      country and offered for sale. (It's also a good idea to try      to buy food staples, in bulk, from cooperatives or health      food stores.) You <em>can</em> lead a very self-reliant      life in an urban environment . . . though in our opinion      country life is by far more enjoyable and healthful.    </p>    <p>      I was very disappointed by your advice, in issue 72, that      homesteaders not bother to save vegetable seed. For the      past two years our small rural county has held a community      seed exchange at a centrally located meeting place. Each      gardener specializes in a different set of vegetables, and      then trades with other growers for the seeds he or she      lacks. (I do well with spinach, onions, parsnips, broccoli,      celery, and kale . . . and swap my treasured seeds for      asparagus, peas, beans, tomatoes, and lettuce.) In this      way, very little land in any given garden is "wasted" to      grow seeds, yet through our <em>combined</em> efforts we're      able to produce all the seeds needed for the following      year's planting. With the "dog-eat-dog" attitude so      prevalent in our society, I think it's a shame to pass up      such an opportunity for creating a sense of community and      sharing among neighbors . . . while-at the same      time-taking a significant step toward food      self-reliance.    </p>    <p>      Hurrah for you and your community for your seed-saving      efforts! Any form of collective activity that leads to      local cooperation is commendable.    </p>    <p>      However, we still feel that the limited space in our small      two-person garden is best utilized by devoting it entirely      to primary crops, so we save very few seeds for the coming      year.    </p>    <p>      In MOTHER NOS. 56 and 61 you shared your views about the      negative aspects of owning pets and-as      vegetarians-you're of course opposed to raising      animals for meat. I was wondering, though, whether you are      also against keeping bees as "livestock" . . . and, if not,      why did you choose not to produce honey on your land?    </p>    <p>      Although bees are not actually considered      <em>livestock</em> , the consumer-by eating      honey-exploits the insects' productive labor . . .      and we object to this practice. Furthermore, honey is one      of the concentrated sweets that we are trying to eliminate      from our diet. (In fact, one of the reasons we left Vermont      was that we were producing and consuming large quantities      of maple syrup.) On a practical level, too, beekeeping      wouldn't suit us. There are few flowers in our region for      the insects to harvest from, and even fewer apiarists in      the area. And because we like to come and go as we please,      we feel that the on-the-spot attention often demanded of      beekeepers would hinder our mobility.    </p>
