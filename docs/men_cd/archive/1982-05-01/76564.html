                        <p>      School will soon be out for the summer in most places, and      now's the perfect time to pick up a free supply of      children's clothing. Pearl Zank visits her neighborhood      elementary school every spring and requests all the      unclaimed garments from the lost-and-found department. The      "orphans" usually include sweaters, jackets, caps, mittens,      boots, and more (Pearl has all the items thoroughly cleaned      before using them) . . . and the Rushland, Pennsylvania      reader reports that she's kept her youngest child well      dressed for <em>six years</em> by using this method.    </p>    <p>      "No matter how many times I tried to encourage frogs to      homestead under flowerpots or boards in my garden, the      hoppers all moved away," Sylvia Lucas wrote from      Montevallo, Alabama. "I finally solved that problem,      however, by raising my own frogs. I took a child's wading      pool . . . covered the bottom with soil, rocks, and a board      or two . . . and adopted some tadpoles from a nearby      stream. My children were fascinated by watching the      wigglers turn into tiny frogs, and many of the critters      stayed around to keep my garden pests under control (and      raise <em>another</em> generation of frogs)."    </p>    <p>      To keep varmints out of the roof rafters of your barn or      chicken coop, just run a wire along the center of each      joist, two or three inches above the wood. Then the animals      won't be able to walk on the beams . . . according to      Richard Anderson of Port Angeles, Washington.    </p>    <p>      Having been out of the "baby needs" market for over eight      years, Jim and Donna Carmean were shocked-when      shopping in preparation for the arrival of their third      child-to discover how expensive infant items had      become. Small flannel receiving blankets, for instance,      were priced at $6.00 apiece. Well, Donna found a way around      <em>that</em> expense by cutting one standard-sized flannel      sheet into four equal sections. She crocheted a finished      edge around all four sides of each quarter (if you don't      crochet, try simply sewing a blanket stitch border), and      then attached a small animal appliqu√© in one corner.      Since the Grayling, Michigan resident paid only $8.00 for      the sheet, she got four <em>extra-large</em> baby blankets      at $2.00 each ... or one-third the price of the ready-made      variety.    </p>    <p>      If your garden needs lime (and most do), Steve Morse of      Columbia, Kentucky knows a way to get some inexpensively.      Instead of purchasing bags of the soil nutrient, Steve      takes a trash can to a nearby quarry and shovels his own.      The going rate for such lime is about $4.00 a ton . . . but      Steve says the fellow at the gate lets him take his "puny"      canful for free! [ <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Be sure to test your      soil before spreading the lime . . . and to add the      substance gradually, being careful not to overcompensate      for a small pH imbalance.</em> ]    </p>    <p>      Using 16-penny nails as stakes for new seedlings      (especially tomato and eggplant) will prevent cutworms from      attacking the tender young stalks, says Wil Edwards of      Jackson, Tennessee. As the plants grow taller and stronger,      wooden stakes can be used to replace the nails.    </p>    <p>      Electric brooms and sweepers can generally be purchased      secondhand at great savings, but often the used appliances      won't include the <em>variety</em> of attachments that      accompany brand-new models. Well, Mary Ann      Hilgren-who hails from Oquawka, Illinois-has a      tip for those of you in such a predicament. She saves the      cardboard centers from toilet tissue and paper towels and      makes a slit, an inch or two long, on one end of each roll.      Then she overlaps the edges (adapting the opening to match      the size of her cleaner's hose nozzle) and seals the tube      to the nozzle with tape. The unsealed end can then be      molded or bent to reach almost any "impossible" corner or      crevice!    </p>    <p>      Here's a household tip that'll help you do two tasks at      once. St. Johns, Michigan reader Kathy Tyler washes her      bathtub out with a household mop! By sprinkling the      still-damp tub with cleanser after bathing and then      scrubbing it with the long-handled cleaning utensil, Kathy      gets both the tub and the mop clean . . . and saves her      back from unnecessary bending.    </p>    <p>      When thinning out her strawberry patch, Brenda Hartley      partially buries paper cups, three-quarters full of soil,      near the ends of new runners. Then she pushes one of the      plant-forming "vines" into each cup, waters them all, and      allows them to rest for a week or so while they set roots.      After that, the Danville, Illinois reader simply clips the      runners and carries the cups to new locations. Once there,      the paper containers can be easily removed without      disturbing the plants . . . and her strawberry patch stays      orderly <em>and</em> keeps on expanding!    </p>    <p>      "For the past few years our family has been eating,      preserving, and feeding our livestock <em>free</em> fruits      and vegetables!" writes Mrs. Steve Horn from Chase, Kansas.      "Every time we go grocery shopping in town, you see, we ask      the retailers for their vegetable clippings and throwaways.      In our area such produce is free for the hauling. Better      yet, nearly every case of outer lettuce leaves, for      example, also contains several perfectly good      <em>heads</em> . Our animals enjoy the loose trimmings, and      our family relishes the free salad fixings. Furthermore,      occasionally the stores will have certain vegetables on      'special', and when the sales are over we may 'inherit'      such usually expensive foods as cauliflower, tomatoes, and      peppers. Again, our livestock can feast on any of the      fruits and vegetables that are heavily damaged, and I      preserve the 'passable' fare for future dinners!"    </p>        <p>      After spending good money-one too many times-on      plastic siphon kits that proved useless, Daniel Owczarzak      discovered a "foolproof" method of siphoning gasoline. The      Elmo, New Yorker takes a hose and a used or outdated      automotive fuel pump-easily found at flea markets for      a modest sum-and slips one end of the hose into the      gas tank. He then attaches the other end to the pump's      inlet tube. By sliding a small pipe onto the device's shaft      and pumping it once or twice, he soon has gasoline gushing      from the outlet tube. When this occurs, Dan simply removes      the hose and installs his to-be-filled container!    </p>        <p>      Don't throw out those broken toys! Tina Chappell-a      Tarheeler from Tyner, North Carolina-suggests      completely disassembling the battered amusements and      packing the pieces away. Then, when rainy weather dictates      indoor activity, Tina gives her youngsters the box of      parts-along with plenty of glue-and lets them      "invent" their own playthings.    </p>    <p>      B.J. VanDerBerg passed on this tip about hustling up      crickets for his fishing expeditions. The Elkhart, Indiana      angler spreads out a piece of plastic- about two feet      square-on the ground near the water. He sprinkles a      half-cup of sugar on the plastic . . . and covers the lure      with doubled-up damp newspaper. In the morning the Hoosier      simply picks up the plastic and dumps all the      crickets-and there should be plenty!-into his      bait bucket.    </p>    <p>      Are you ready to replace your old lawn furniture with a new      set? If so, here's a suggestion on how to get more use out      of a time-worn chair. Donna Camp-Schuster recommends      cutting away the webbing and letting the frame serve as a      sack holder for leaves and garden rubbish! The Santa Cruz,      Californian just places a plastic trash bag through the      seat portion and folds the top over the arms and back of      the chair.    </p>    <p>      Don't throw away the frayed webbing that you remove,      either! Mel Bauman of Springwater, New York protects his      young fruit trees from wildlife nibblers by wrapping the      strips around the base of each tree. The web's open weave      allows the tree to breathe and doesn't collect moisture,      and the material stands up to weather really well!    </p>    <p>      You can protect your orchard from unwanted pests by      wrapping tree trunks with old-fashioned flypaper strips,      too. Kimbolton, Ohio's Rose Steward wrote to say that she      stopped an invasion of tent caterpillars by this method . .      . and Walter Garrison of Kuna, Idaho guarantees it'll halt      ants and earwigs-or any other      creepy-crawlers-in their tracks, as well. Sunshine      seems to keep the strips extra sticky . . . and since the      substance is nontoxic, it won't harm pets.    </p>    <p>      To keep rabbits, groundhogs, raccoons, and other      four-legged nuisances out of your garden this season, take      a tip from John Pitts of Orillia, Ontario. In the early      spring he puts several carpet scraps on the front porch for      the family pets to lie on. Then, when his garden begins      growing, the Canadian transfers those odoriferous rugs to      the borders of his vegetable plot and puts new carpet      pieces on the porch. The "doggie" scent repels unwanted      guests from the garden . . . and, by continually swapping      scraps from porch to plot, John is able to protect his      crops all summer long!    </p>    <p>      Frances dark of Nashville, Tennessee sent us a postcard      chock- <em>full</em> of good ideas. Since space doesn't      allow us to print them all (we try to let as many of our      readers as possible "speak" in this column), here are two      of her best tips: Frances reports that cheese will be      easier to grate if first placed in the freezer for ten      minutes, and she also recommends tying a string of bells      around the doorknob of your child's bedroom ... to alert      you when the youngster gets up during the night.    </p>    <p>      Nancy Crawford enjoys macram√©, and she likes to make      outdoor hangings to hold plants and bird feeders in her      Mattoon, Illinois yard. But Nancy recently discovered, to      her dismay, that squirrels were shredding the "tails" off      her hangings to use as nesting material. To prevent the      destruction, Ms. Crawford tied large knots at the ends of      her macram√© art . . . and soon began to feel guilty      as she watched her furry friends laboriously (and      unsuccessfully) trying to steal more fibers. So now, Nancy      just ties all her <em>leftover</em> pieces of jute outside,      and watches with pleasure as both squirrels and birds pluck      strands for their nests.    </p>    <p>      Finally, here's a bit of lore of a <em>different</em> sort,      donated by Priscilla Cook of Mountain Home, Idaho. "For      good health, avoid these exercises: carrying grudges . . .      flying into a rage . . . stretching the truth . . . jumping      to conclusions . . . digging up old scandals . . . going on      wild goose chases . . . patting yourself on the back . . .      and raking people over the coals."    </p>    <p>      <em>Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, down-home, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday life.
