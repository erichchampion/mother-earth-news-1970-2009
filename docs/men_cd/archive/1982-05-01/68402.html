                    <p>      <em>Whether you want wool, meat or milk, you'll find the      right sheep in our vet's rundown on...</em>    </p>           <p>      <strong>Randy Kidd, D.V.M.</strong><br />      All the evidence available to us today indicates that the      association between humans and sheep goes back to      prehistoric times. Of course, there's little doubt that      many a wild ram and ewe wound up in the bellies of      Neanderthal hunters . . . and surviving records-in      the form of testaments, artwork, and such-show that      primitive pastoral peoples used domesticated sheep for      wool, skins, milk, and tallow as well as for meat. For      example, an early Egyptian sculpture shows sheep being      driven across a freshly sown field in the Nile Valley,      apparently so their hoofs could press the seeds into the      soil. Furthermore, wool was used as clothing material by      the Babylonians at least 4,000 years before the birth of      Christ. All in all, then, we've been together a long time.    </p>    <p>      And-over those centuries-if humankind has      affected the development of sheep, sheep have, in turn,      affected the development of nations. In England, the wool      industry flourished until, by the sixteenth century, it had      become the chief source of revenue for the Crown. While      Spain (to give a more dramatic example) refused to give up      its monopoly on Merino sheep-the secret of that      country's lucrative wool export industry-to the point      that Spanish law actually specified the death penalty for      anyone found guilty of exporting a live Merino!    </p>    <p>      In recent years wool has been largely supplanted by      synthetic fibers, and only one-third of today's American      sheep raisers derive their income from the sale of fleece.      Nevertheless, wool finds its way into some of the finest      (and often most costly) articles on the market . . . it's      still incomparable for warmth, durability, versatility, and      beauty.    </p>    <p>      Happily enough, the increasing interest in homesteading and      in handmade, homespun apparel and furnishings has caused a      lot of people to take a second look at sheep . . . finding      them to be practical small-farm livestock <em>and</em> a      source of easily handled, unusual wools. And whether a      person wants animals for meat or wool, a backyard flock can      be one of the most economical components of a self-reliant      homestead.    </p>    <p>      The breeds listed below include some of the most popular      (as well as a few not so popular) types of sheep in the      United States. Naturally, this article can be only an      overview, and anyone who is inspired to consider acquiring      a flock should make a thorough study of the breeds that      seem most appropriate to his or her purpose . . .      <em>before</em> making a purchase.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong><br />      Sheep can be grouped in any of several ways: by their      suitability as meat producers, by the length or quality of      their wool, by their face color, or by their adaptation to      different altitudes. Probably the most useful kind of      grouping is classification by wool grades . . . which has      gone through its own evolution over the years. The most      modern method uses the micron (1/25,000 inch) as a      standard, and then rates wool by the average diameter of      the fibers in a given lot: The finer the wool, then, the      smaller the micron number.    </p>    <p>      The micron system appears to be more technically accurate      than its predecessors (such as the formerly popular "count"      system, for instance, which classed wool by the number of      hanks that could be spun from a pound), and there is some      effort being made to establish it as the standard for      describing wools in the United States. Few people, however,      have a "feel" for micron measurement, so the sheep listed      here are simply categorized as having fine, medium, or long      wool.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINE-WOOLED BREEDS</strong><br />      The fine-wooled breeds in the U.S. include the American      Merino, Delaine Merino, Rambouillet, and Debouillet. Like      the Spanish Merino from which they're all descended, these      varieties are noted for fine, tightly crimped wool that has      a heavy, greasy covering called "yolk". (When refined, this      combination of secretions from the sebaceous and sweat      glands becomes the smooth, oily product we call lanolin.)    </p>    <p>      In recent years the meatmaking capabilities of these breeds      have been improved, but if you're looking to put lamb chops      on the table, there <em>are</em> better meat types      available. On the other hand, though, ewes of the      fine-wooled types will often breed out of season ... a      definite advantage for the owner who's interested in      maximum productivity.    </p>    <p>      MERINO. No other breed has contributed more to the      development of other sheep types than has the Merino. Early      examples of this breed had thick wrinkles along their      entire bodies, a characteristic that breeders later      discovered produced wool of inferior quality. Now called      "type A", these sheep are rarely seen today, having given      way to the less wrinkled varieties known as "type B" and      the virtually wrinkle-free "type C", or Delaine Merinos.    </p>    <p>      All three varieties are hardy, long-lived, and possessed of      a strong flocking instinct. Their fleece is super-fine and      therefore difficult for any but an experienced spinner to      manage, but it does make up into very high-quality yarns.    </p>    <p>      RAMBOUILLET. The Rambouillet, a direct descendant of the      Spanish Merino, is the largest of the fine-wooled breeds.      The animals are commonly used in crossbreeding programs . .      . and it's been estimated that at least 50% of all the      sheep in the U.S. have <em>some</em> Rambouillet blood in      their background. (The Debouillet, for example, is a      Delaine/Rambouillet cross.)    </p>    <p>      Rambouillets are considered dual-purpose (meat and wool)      sheep. They have superior long, dense, fine wool that's      very popular for spinning. Most rams of the breed sport      large spiral horns, but some strains are polled (hornless).    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEDIUM-WOOLED BREEDS</strong><br />      The most popular medium-wooled breeds include the Cheviot      and North Country Cheviot, Montadale, Dorset, Tunis,      Hampshire, Oxford, Shropshire, Suffolk, and Southdown. (The      last five examples in this list are sometimes called the      "Down" breeds, a reference to the hills and downs of      southern England which were their place of origin.)    </p>    <p>      All of the medium-wooled sheep were developed for meat, and      their fleece is rated somewhere between the extreme      fineness and density of the Merino and the coarseness and      "open" quality typical of the long-wooled sheep. Most of      these breeds have dark faces and dark legs.    </p>    <p>      SOUTHDOWN. The smallest (and oldest) of the Down types, the      Southdown is said to produce the finest mutton of any      sheep. Its compact, wide, deep body type was used as the      foundation stock for all the other Down breeds. The young      reach market weight quickly . . . however, the      ewes-which are just average milkers-are not      prolific. Southdown wool is relatively short and can be      used to make a fine (thin) yarn.    </p>    <p>      SHROPSHIRE. The original Shropshires had a wool "cap"      extending down to the muzzle, but because this contributed      to an ailment known as "wool blindness", breeders have      worked to develop a clean-faced variety. Long-lived, hardy,      and prolific, Shropshires have the heaviest fleece of the      mutton types, but it tends to be short and varies in      quality from fine to medium grade.    </p>    <p>      OXFORD. The largest of the medium-wooled sheep, Oxfords are      the result of crossing Hampshires and Cotswolds (both      described below) in the mid-1800's. Oxford lambs are large      (9 to 12 pounds) at birth and therefore reach market weight      early.    </p>    <p>      HAMPSHIRE. A very popular breed, used extensively for      crossbreeding, Hampshires are heavy milkers and often      produce twins. The lambs are born dark and gradually turn      white, keeping dark legs and faces.    </p>    <p>      Because of their large size (second only to that of the      Oxford in the Down group), Hampshires need good pasture and      feed, and won't thrive if left to forage on poor ground.      The ewes sometimes experience lambing problems because of      the large head and shoulders typical of the young ones.    </p>    <p>      SUFFOLK. The thin, black-faced, black-legged look      indicative of the Suffolk strain can be seen in many of the      crossbred sheep raised on our western ranges. Unlike the      Hampshires, Suffolk lambs have small heads and shoulders      and thus give little trouble at lambing time. Members of      the breed are active foragers, too, and their meat has less      fat and finer texture than does that of most other      medium-wooled breeds.    </p>    <p>      DORSET. Both the rams and ewes of the original Dorset breed      had massive horns. Recently, however, a polled strain has      been developed. Dorsets will breed out of season . . . are      noted milkers . . . and are active, thrifty foragers.    </p>    <p>      CHEVIOT. With its distinctive white face, erect ears, Roman      nose, and small size, the Cheviot is easy to identify. This      hardy breed originated in the rugged hills of Scotland, and      is quite suitable for small farms. Furthermore, Cheviots      produce a medium-grade fleece which is prized by many      spinners because it doesn't need carding.    </p>    <p>      NORTH COUNTRY CHEVIOT. Larger than the original Cheviot,      the North Country strain is also calmer in temperament. The      fleece of this interesting "new" breed is of medium grade      and excellent for spinning.    </p>    <p>      MONTADALE. Montadales originated in America-as a      result of crossbreeding Cheviots and Columbias-in      1932. They are an attractive and hardy dual-purpose,      intermediate-sized sheep . . . with good-quality medium      fleece.    </p>    <p>      TUNIS. Easily recognized by its red or tan face and      pendulous ears, the Tunis originated in North Africa. Like      some other desert sheep, it has fatty tissue in its tail,      and can call on that stored energy when forced to go      without food for extended periods. Popular in the South,      the Tunis was nearly wiped out during the Civil War but      staged a comeback in the late 1890's. It's now once again      growing in popularity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LONG-WOOLED BREEDS</strong><br />      The long-wooled breeds-the Cotswolds, Border      Leicester, Lincoln, and Romney, for example-were      developed primarily for mutton. They are typically the      largest sheep (225- to 350-pound rams and 175- to 275-pound      ewes are common). Their wool is generally very long, open,      and coarse (it's frequently used in carpets, wall hangings,      and outerwear), and heavy rains may cause the fleece to      part and allow the sheep to get wet to the skin. When that      happens, the wool is undamaged, but the animals sometimes      become ill as a result of their drenching. These strains      tend to mature slowly and are likely to become fatty, but      their large size often makes them desirable for      crossbreeding.    </p>    <p>      COTSWOLD. One of the oldest breeds, the Cotswold has a tuft      of hair on its forehead and long, lustrous wool with      natural curls, which many spinners find pleasant to work      with.    </p>    <p>      BORDER LEICESTER. Developed in the border country between      England and Scotland, the Border Leicester has the erect      ears and Roman nose of the Cheviot . . . with wool      averaging between 8 and 12 inches long. The fleece is      coarse, and has considerable luster.    </p>    <p>      LINCOLN. The Lincolns are the heavyweights of sheepdom and      also grow the heaviest fleece-up to 30 pounds from      one ram-which is usually from 10 to 15 inches long      (one Lincoln produced a record 32-inch-long coat!),      lustrous, long-wearing, and difficult to card. These      animals are somewhat sluggish and slow to mature, but they      add size and staple (a term for fiber length and diameter)      to other breeds when used for crossbreeding.    </p>    <p>      ROMNEY. In full fleece, Romneys are noted for their      beautiful faces <em>and</em> beautiful coats. Unlike that      of some other "long" varieties, their wool is relatively      fine, dense, and much desired by hand-spinners because it      doesn't need carding. Romneys are quiet, particularly      resistant to foot problems, and known for high milk      production.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CROSSBRED TYPES</strong><br />      Breeds such as the Columbia, Corriedale, and Targhee are      the result of attempts to produce larger ewes that'll yield      more wool and heavier market lambs than do other types.      Their fleece is usually of medium to fine quality, and many      such breeds have adapted well to western U.S. range      conditions.    </p>    <p>      COLUMBIA. This strain was developed from a      Lincoln/Ram-bouillet cross in the early 1900's. It's a      tight-flocking, dual-purpose sheep that does well on range      or farm.    </p>    <p>      CORRIEDALE. A New Zealand breed resulting from a cross      between Lincoln and Merino sheep, Corriedales generally      produce more pounds of wool and lamb per pound of ewe body      weight than does any other range type. They're fairly      prolific, adequate milkers, and tight herders . . .      producing wool that's noted for its brightness, softness,      distinct crimp, and ease of handling. This is another      fleece type that can be worked without carding.    </p>    <p>      TARGHEE. Targhees (so called after the national forest of      the same name) are an American breed that was developed in      Idaho back around 1926. They're prolific (often having      twins or triplets), large, and resistant to both internal      parasites and hoof problems. Their ancestors are the      Lincoln, Rambouillet, and Corriedale.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER BREEDS TO PONDER</strong><br />      SCOTTISH HIGHLAND (OR BLACKFACE). Members of this very old      Scottish breed are among the most common sheep in Britain      today. They tend to be small, horned, and oddly mottled      with black on their faces and legs. Highland fleece is very      long (15 to 18 inches) and quite springy. It's used to make      carpets, tweeds, and mattress stuffing. The sheep also      produce excellent mutton.    </p>    <p>      FINNSHEEP. Multiple births are this breed's claim to fame .      . . the ewes may have litters of anywhere from three to      seven lambs! Finnsheep are fine-boned and medium-sized, and      they produce a very lustrous, light fleece that spins well.    </p>    <p>      KARAKUL. This is the only <em>true</em> black sheep . . .      since all the other dark types are mutations of various      <em>white</em> breeds. Karakuls are the source of      broadtail, Persian lamb, and half-Persian furs (those terms      refer to the pelts of lambs at various stages of growth).      Adult Karakul sheep have long, coarse outer hair with a      fine undercoat. Usually born black, they do lighten in      color as they age, and may turn to any of various shades of      brown, blue, gray, or even white.    </p>    <p>      NAVAJO. The Navajo is quite possibly a descendant of the      Spanish Jacob (or Piebald) sheep. The breed hasn't been      standardized and therefore occurs in a wide range of sizes,      shapes, colors . . . <em>and</em> number of horns: The rams      may have from one to four!    </p>    <p>      BARBADOS. The Barbados Blackbellies (see the article in      MOTHER NO. 65, page 38) are "hair" sheep with practically      no wool. A long "cape" around the neck and shoulders does      have fibers that can be spun, however. Barbados are used in      crossbreeding to add hardiness, multiple births,      and-important for handspinners-color variety.      The sheep will also breed out of season.    </p>    <p>      <strong>YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN</strong><br />      Improvements are continually being made in established      breeds, while new strains are being developed all the time      to meet the needs of today's farmers and ranchers. As you'd      imagine, then, this article can't do justice to      <em>all</em> the varieties available . . . but it might      just serve to break ground for those homesteaders whose      back-to-basics lifestyle has made them ready for a      long-term relationship with one of humanity's      oldest-and most valuable-associates.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: There are many good books available on      sheep, including the interesting and unusual</em>      Adventures in Fleece, <em>by Buhnne Tramutola.
