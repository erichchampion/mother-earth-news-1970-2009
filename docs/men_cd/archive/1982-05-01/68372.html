                    <p>      <em>It's still not too hot for early morning baking . . .      and these loaves will accent any summer meal.</em>    </p>        <p>      STAFF PHOTO    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nancy Bubel</strong><br />      Homemade bread, fresh from the oven, rates high on almost      everybody's list of favorite foods. And these two herb and      spice recipes both produce loaves that are just right to      serve with quick, light meals    </p>    <p>      <strong>HERB BREAD</strong><br />      Folks who enjoy gardening as well as baking can give this      recipe the added savor of homegrown flavorings. (If sage      and celery seed aren't among your favorite herbs, you can      substitute others of your own choice, but do keep the      nutmeg: It seems to set the stage for the rest!)    </p>    <p>      1/4 cup of honey<br />      1/4 cup of oil or lard<br />      1 tablespoon of salt<br />      1-1/2 cups of milk, scalded<br />      2 tablespoons of active dry yeast<br />      1/2 cup of warm water<br />      4 teaspoons of celery or caraway seed<br />      2 teaspoons of ground sage<br />      1 teaspoon of nutmeg<br />      2 eggs<br />      6-7 cups of whole wheat flour    </p>    <p>      To begin, mix the honey, salt, and shortening in a large      bowl and pour the scalded milk over them. While that      mixture is cooling, stir the dry yeast into the warm      (105-110°F, or "wrist" temperature) water until it      softens and dissolves. Add the yeast preparation to the now      lukewarm milk mix, then stir in the celery or caraway seed,      sage, and nutmeg before beating in the eggs and 2 cups of      the whole wheat flour.    </p>    <p>      Once everything is blended well, continue adding flour      until you've used a total of 6 to 7 cups (when the dough      begins to form a ball and "cleans" the sides of the bowl,      you've used enough). Then oil your hands, turn the mass out      onto a lightly floured board, and knead it for 5 to 10      minutes until it's smooth and elastic. Put the dough into a      clean, oiled bowl, turning it so that all sides are slicked      . . . cover the container with greased wax paper and a thin      cloth . . . and let the dough rise in a warm place until it      has doubled in size.    </p>    <p>      Now, punch down the risen mound, knead it again, and shape      it. Put the loaves into two greased 4-1/2" X 8-1/2" pans,      cover them lightly with a clean dish towel, and let them      rise again until they've almost- but not      quite!-doubled in bulk. Bake the bread in a preheated      350°F oven for about 45 minutes (it should be nicely      browned and make a hollow sound when tapped). Five minutes      or so before you expect the loaves to be done, brush the      tops with beaten egg white or milk to give them a soft      shine.    </p>    <p>      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: MOTHER'S tasters were enthusiastic      about this herb bread. All of us felt that, depending upon      an individual's choice of herbs and taste preferences, it      could be a wonderful accompaniment for summer salad dinners      (see this article for suggestions on those) . . . and,      especially when prepared with herbs from your own home      garden, it would make a very personal and satisfying gift      as well.]<br /></em><br />      <strong>FINNISH BRAID</strong><br />      Here's a bread that owes much of its appeal to the taste of      cardamom, an Oriental spice that's long been prized in      Scandinavia as a flavoring for baked goods and liqueurs.    </p>    <p>      1 cup of milk, scalded<br />      1/3 cup of honey<br />      1 tablespoon of salt<br />      1/4 cup of oil or melted butter<br />      2 tablespoons of active dry yeast<br />      1/3 cup of warm water<br />      1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cardamom<br />      powder (or grind the seeds from 3 to 5 pods)<br />      3 eggs<br />      6-7 cups of whole wheat flour    </p>    <p>      To make this fragrant bread, first pour the scalded milk      into a large mixing bowl with the salt, honey, and oil or      butter. Set the hot liquid aside, and dissolve the yeast in      the warm water (as in the first recipe) before adding it to      the cooled milk mixture.    </p>    <p>      Next, stir in the cardamom and beat in the eggs. Then add 2      cups of the flour, stir it vigorously to help develop the      gluten, and continue adding flour until you've used a total      of 6 or 7 cups and the dough pulls away from the side of      the bowl. Turn the bread-to-be out on a floured board,      knead it for 8 to 10 minutes, and let it rise in a clean,      oiled bowl-lightly covered-until it has doubled      in size.    </p>    <p>      At that point, punch the dough down, knead it again      (briefly), and divide it in half. Cut each section into      three equal parts and roll the six pieces into long, smooth      ropes. Then braid the cables-in groups of      three-on a greased cookie sheet, making two loaves.      Let the bread rise again to almost double its size, brush      it with beaten egg or milk, and bake it in a preheated      350°F oven for about 30 minutes ... or until its crust      is deeply golden brown.    </p>    <p>      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: This bread drew rave reviews from our      tasters, too. Furthermore, because the braid is decorative      as well as tasty, it's especially suited to gift giving, or      for those occasions when you've invited company for      dinner.]</em>    </p>
