                    <p>      <em>In many parts of the Third World, earthen stoves are      reducing energy needs and changing traditional methods of      food preparation. Now you can build one of the efficient      cookers yourself.</em>    </p>    <p>      PHOTOS BY THE AUTHOR<br />    </p>        <p>      The front damper of this lorena cooker slides on a pair of      runners.    </p>                <p>      CROSS SECTION<br />      Earthen stoves can be custom-built to your design and can      feature, for instance, up to four potholes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Larry Bradshaw</strong><br />      Louga, Voltena, Kaya, Chula, and Lorena... the terms sound      like mysterious incantations from a sorcerous ritual.      Actually, though, they're all types of simple earthen      stoves . . . do-it-yourself appliances that promise to      revolutionize cooking-and reduce fuel consumption      levels-on a global scale.    </p>    <p>      Developed, for the most part, by students of appropriate      technology working with native peoples, sand/clay      cookstoves are beginning to replace traditional      fuel-gobbling open fires in the Third World . . . where      deforestation, desertification, and dependence on imported      fuels have long plagued developing nations. Thanks to the      earthen heaters' simple construction, low cost, and      convenience of operation, staff members of such      international aid organizations as Volunteers in Asia, Save      the Children, and Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA)      have successfully introduced the relatively efficient units      to areas of Africa, Asia, and South America.    </p>    <p>      And, impressively enough, this growing "kitchen revolution"      has already decreased wood usage sufficiently to allow many      such regions to take the first hesitant steps toward      reforestation: The cookers can, you see, conserve as much      as 50% of the wood (or charcoal) that would be required to      prepare the same food over an open fire. And, on a more      personal scale, earthen stoves provide safer cooking      conditions . . . and produce less smoke, thus lowering the      risk of related respiratory ailments.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, while the initial motivation behind the      development of mudstoves was the overwhelming need to ease      the serious energy crisis facing Third World countries, the      simple-to-build units could certainly be valuable to many      people in North America as well. The fact is that anyone      who'd like an attractive, inexpensive outdoor stove (to be      used, perhaps, for summer canning and baking or even      barbecuing) could do a lot worse than to build an earthen      cooker.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT IT'S MADE OF</strong><br />      In essence, a mudstove is little more than a firebox      enclosed by an earthen mass usually made of sand and clay,      building materials that are commonly available at little or      no cost. Simplicity is the key to the cookers' design, and      the construction details can be altered to suit individual      needs.    </p>    <p>      Fine sand can, of course, be found along the edges of      streams and at the ends of rain washes. Once collected, the      grains should be sieved, through a 4mm screen mesh, to      remove pebbles and other foreign matter. Clays, in turn,      can often be easily scouted out in roadcuts and ditches,      and along streambeds with exposed banks. If you have      trouble finding a source of clay, though, local potters and      agricultural extension agents might be able to help search      out nearby deposits. As you'd imagine, <em>sandy</em> clays      are especially well suited for use as stove materials,      while silt should be avoided. (You should clean freshly dug      clay by first drying it and then sifting the "dust" through      a 5mm mesh.)    </p>    <p>      To determine the suitability of a clay sample, just wet a      handful and work it into a pliable consistency. Then try to      mold a thick rope of it around your finger: The mud should      retain its workable state and form a ring easily. If it      does, you can next flatten out the test piece into a rough      tile (1/4" or more in thickness), dry it, and "bisque" it      in a small fire. After the flames die, leave the clay tile      in the hot coals for half an hour, then remove it to cool.      The finished piece should resist crumbling when scratched      or pinched.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MIXING THE SAND AND CLAY</strong><br />      Once a generous quantity of raw material is collected (your      own stove design will determine exactly how much you'll      need, but do gather roughly three to four times more sand      than clay), you're ready to produce a mix with the proper      consistency. Appropriate combinations can      range-depending upon the specific characteristics of      the substances used-from a sand/clay ratio of 2:1 up      to one of 5:1.    </p>    <p>      The ingredients, in dry form, should first be thoroughly      mixed and ground under foot on a clean surface. When the      clay appears to be well pulverized into the sand (30      minutes of mixing for a 20-gallon batch isn't unusual),      water is added slowly, ground in, and then shovel-mixed.    </p>    <p>      The most reliable method of testing for the correct      sand/clay/water proportions is to make and compare sample      bricks from several different mixtures. Use a hammer      handle, a length of 2 X 4, or your fist to compact the      material into thoroughly wet rectangular wooden frames. Be      sure to compress it until your finger can't penetrate the      surface deeper than about 1/2 inch, and be especially      careful to pack down the mix along the edges and in the      corners... where the finished bricks are most likely to      split or crumble. Then remove the molds and leave the      blocks to dry in the sun (remembering to turn them      regularly to assure even drying).    </p>    <p>      The success or failure of any particular sample mixture      will be readily apparent: If cracks form across a test      brick's surface, you've got too much clay (resulting in      quick shrinkage)... if crumbling around the edges occurs      with reasonably gentle handling, there's too much sand. The      ideal blend of the two components will yield a dry block      which-although it'll shatter if struck      sharply-has good cohesion and compressive      strength.<br />      <br />      <strong>PLANNING AND SHAPING THE STOVE</strong><br />      After you've determined the best possible recipe and mixed      your raw materials, you can begin to shape the huge lump of      earth into a cookstove. While there are many different      designs in use around the world, we'll concentrate here on      the lorena stove, a versatile cooker that was originally      developed in the highlands of Guatemala and is now being      used in several other Central American countries. Its name,      by the way, is a composite of the Spanish words for mud (      <em>lodo</em> ) and sand ( <em>arena</em> ).    </p>    <p>      This particular design allows hot gases from the fire to      traverse a tunnel that winds through the stove's body, and      then to exit via a simple chimney. While topside cooking is      in progress, the lorena's great earthen mass stores heat,      which can then be used for extended food warming or for      baking . . . even <em>after</em> the fire has died out. The      rate of burn is controlled by adjusting one crude but      effective scrap-tin damper at the opening of the firebox      and another just in front of the exit flue.    </p>    <p>      The cooking pots fit tightly into deeply recessed holes on      the stove's upper surface. It's best to limit the number of      potholes to no more than three, but their size and shape      will depend upon the specific utensils you plan to use. The      tunnel must pass under and connect the holes . . . forming      a bend beneath each pot to assure maximum heat transfer.    </p>    <p>      You'll probably want to sketch an outline of the stovetop      on the ground or floor next to the construction site in      order to determine the dimensions and placement of the      potholes and the position of the flue. Using that drawing      as a guide, you can go on to form first a solid, level      base, either of lorena mixture or of stone or old brick      (which is needed because any shifting of the foundation      could cause cracks in the stove's body, and which can also      elevate the unit to a convenient height) and then the stove      itself, working upward in straight vertical lines.    </p>    <p>      The stove body will be built up, in layers, to form a solid      block . . . into which you'll later carve the potholes and      tunnel. Start by shoveling some of the lorena mixture onto      the base and spreading it out to an overall depth of five      or six inches. Then compress the material with a homemade      wooden tamper (again, a piece of 2 X 4 will do) as you did      the test blocks.    </p>    <p>      Add successive layers in the same manner, taking care      always to maintain the stove's vertical line. When tamping      near the perimeter of the structure, you'll need to support      the outer edge with a wooden frame . . . using either      right-angled or curved forms at the corners, depending on      the shape you've chosen. As you build, make sure all the      layers of lorena have the same consistency, in order to      create a strong, unified mass . . . and always cover the      block with a plastic sheet whenever you have to stop work.      (If the material becomes too dry at this point, the      interior carving that'll be done later will be quite      difficult.)    </p>    <p>      The finished height of the stove will depend on the depth      of its largest pot: Align that container's rim with the      cooker's top edge, and then make sure there's a good six to      eight inches of solid lorena between the pot's bottom and      the stove's base, to allow room for tunneling. When the      block finally reaches the proper height, scribe the      position of the pots, the tunnels, and the chimney hole on      its surface. As you lay out the design, be sure to leave a      three- or four-inch margin (about the width of a fist)      between the potholes and the stove's edge.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CARVING THE TUNNELS</strong><br />      Just as the lorena stove can be molded from simple      materials,. it's also <em>carved</em> with rudimentary      tools. In fact, a large metal Spoon is all you'll need for      scraping out the firebox and the inner passageways.      Remember, though, to keep your utensil wet, and to leave an      insulating layer of lorena ( <em>at least</em> two inches      thick) between the foundation and the bottom of the firebox      and tunnel.    </p>    <p>      Begin burrowing by cutting into one side of the block to      form the firebox. That opening needs to be large enough to      accommodate the fuel you'll be using, but-for maximum      efficiency-it should be no longer or wider than the      first pothole . . . which, in most lorena stoves, rests      directly over the firebox.    </p>    <p>      Next, rough out the potholes . . . checking the fit of each      utensil in its assigned "nest" from time to time. At this      stage, however, let the holes stay slightly undersized,      since their final forms are best shaped after the rest of      the carving is completed. Leave a bit of shoulder to      support the bottom of each pot, and then dig about four      inches deeper than that (go down six inches or so under the      first pot, to make room for the fire) to the level that      will become the floor of the heat passageway. You can scoop      out the chimney hole at this time, too.    </p>    <p>      Once all the holes are properly spaced along the top of the      stove, go on to complete the internal tunneling. Reach      through the firebox and other openings as necessary, and      dig carefully along your inscribed path, intercepting each      pothole and-finally-the chimney hole. Once it      progresses past the firebox, the tunnel should be made      large enough to accommodate-just barely-the      width of a hand holding three eggs. To insure an even flow      of hot gases and smoke, the passage must also be relatively      smooth and <em>gently</em> curved.    </p>    <p>      Following that excavation process, the potholes can be      "fine-tuned" so that they'll allow the cooking utensils to      fit securely in place. Use the containers themselves as      tools (remembering to wet their outer surfaces first), by      twisting and easing them into place . . . <em>without</em>      putting any significant weight on them while doing so. To      insure that it gets the maximum exposure to the heat      circulating inside the stove, each pot should be recessed      until its rim is almost level with the stove surface.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INSERTING THE DAMPERS AND BAFFLES</strong><br />      With the digging and shaping completed, it's time to      install the dampers. The front closure can simply be      attached to the outside of the stove with runners (as shown      in the photo), and a flue damper can be integrated      conventionally into the length of stovepipe that will be      inserted into the chimney hole. Or slots may be cut into      the stove body itself-across the firebox entrance and      in front of the chimney hole, as indicated in the      drawings-to accommodate pieces of thin sheet metal      cut to size and bent at the top to form handles. Make the      slots by carefully easing a large knife or machete down      into the lorena-using gentle pressure-and      working the tool slowly (to prevent cracks) as you form the      vertical slits.    </p>    <p>      The last additions to your homemade cooker will be the      baffles, which act as airfoils to direct the flow of hot      gas and flame toward the bottoms of the pots. Each      baffle-which is actually made from an extra lump of      fresh lorena-is formed at the juncture of tunnel and      pothole, and rises to within two inches of the pot bottom.      Cupping a hand downward, you can easily form the baffle and      press the mix in place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A FEW FINAL TOUCHES</strong><br />      To polish off your handmade stove, you'll need to burnish      the block's surface (inside and out) with a smooth rock or      the back of a spoon. That finishing process helps to seal      the surface against abrasion and spills . . . but you might      want to increase the durability of the lorena even further      with a thin coat of oil or paint, or a cement or plaster      wash. Any sharp corners should, at this time, be rounded      with a wet knife.    </p>    <p>      Depending on your climate and the stove's location, the      hand-formed appliance will take from two to four weeks to      cure completely. By setting occasional small fires in the      stove during that period, you can hasten the drying process      . . . <em>and</em> satisfy your curiosity as to how well      your creation will function! Shrinkage should be very      slight (thanks to the material's high sand content), but      the pots and stovepipe <em>will</em> probably need to be      adjusted in their holes now and then as the stove cures.      Don't worry about the <em>small</em> surface cracks that'll      probably appear while the lorena is drying: They're not a      serious threat.    </p>    <p>      The sand and clay mixture is, of course, water soluble ...      so it can easily be reconstituted should you need to repair      more serious structural cracks or a damaged edge. Just      lightly score around the blemish and dampen the area down      to accept patching. (Larger sections should be terraced and      then rebuilt in layers.) In the unlikely event of a      cave-in, the collapsed wall can even be repacked with fresh      lorena and retunneled.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, a water-soluble stove must be protected      from rain. If you've built it outdoors, either provide it      with a crude shed roof, or cover the cooled cooker with a      plastic tarp after each use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE LORENA IN OPERATION</strong><br />      A lorena stove, when properly made, will be quite      functional and durable . . . and should provide reliable      service for a number of years. The following general      pointers on "the joy of cooking" with mudstoves should      provide you with all the basic instruction you need.      (Remember, though, that each lorena is unique, and can be      expected to demand that you learn the "tricks" required for      its most efficient operation.)    </p>    <p>      The pot that sits over-or closest to-the      firebox will, obviously, be the hottest. The second, while      still quite warm, is usually better suited to simmering and      slow-cooking. The pot farthest from the fire receives only      residual heat, so it's generally best used for such tasks      as keeping a supply of water warm (for washing and so on).    </p>    <p>      Remember that while the stove is in operation, careful      adjustment of the dampers will greatly increase the unit's      efficiency. And after you're through cooking on the      surface, the heat trapped in the lorena's mass can be used      for baking. To turn the firebox into an oven, first clear      out all the coals . . . place <em>wrapped</em> food inside      . . . close both dampers . . . and cover the open potholes      to retain radiant heat.    </p>    <p>      If built <em>indoors</em> , a lorena stove can be modified      to provide thermal storage for home heating ... by      extending the tunnel past the last pothole and through a      second-connected-mass of packed clay and sand      that will, of course, absorb more of the heat left over      from cooking. If you like, this appendage can even be      shaped to your specific needs . . . perhaps as a radiant      "hot seat" or a platform for a small warmed bed. Because of      the mass involved, the surface temperature of such an      accessory will rarely rise above a comfortable level, but      that heat will be retained for a good long time. (If you do      construct an additional earthen section, though, you'll      have to include removable tiles or bricks along its tunnel      route, to permit access for cleaning out built-up soot,      ash, and creosote.)    </p>    <p>      In order to exploit the absorbed heat even further (after      all, why waste "free" energy?), it's possible to route a      cast-iron pipe through the accessory mass as you build it      (this should <em>not</em> intersect the flue tunnel). A      small fan can be placed at one end to pull in room air,      which will be warmed as it passes through the tube, and      blow it out the other end.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the ideas presented here are only a few of the      possible variations on a basic concept. You can see      that-whether it's used as an outdoor cooker or as an      indoor source of heat for a home, garage, or      workshop-the earthen stove is a simple invention with      profound ramifications. By allowing for increased local      self-reliance, requiring only readily gathered materials,      and conserving precious fuel, this fine example of soft      technology offers hope for the deforested Third World ...      as well as an alternative to the often wasteful appliances      typical of our own industrialized society.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For more details on earthen stove      construction, you can order a book entitled Lorena      Owner-Built Stoves from Volunteers in Asia (Dept. TMEN,      P.O. Box 4543, Stanford, California 94305). The 144-page      paperback, published in 1979, costs $4.00 plus $1.00      shipping and handling.</em>    </p>
