                    <p>      PHOTOS SUPPLIED BY THE AUTHOR    </p>        <p>      <em>Tom Brown, Jr. Was brought up in the way of the woods      by a displaced Apache named Stalking Wolf. Today, he is one      of our country’s leading outdoors experts, author of      The Tracker and The Search, and head of one of the largest      tracking and wilderness survival schools in the U.S. (write      Tom Brown, Jr., Dept. TMEN, Box 173, Asbury, New Jersey      08802). Tom has agreed to do a series of special features      for MOTHER, articles that will help us all learn how to      survive in the wilds. With the Tracker’s guidance, we      can become more…</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tom Brown, Jr.</strong><br />      It's very difficult to write a survival article on wild      foods that will be relevant to readers in a broad range of      areas and terrains. Therefore, I've tried to include a      variety of widely distributed plants that can be easily      identified and are-for the most part-to be      found throughout the year.    </p>    <p>      Remember, though, that when a person sets out to gather      wild edibles, he or she must do so with a great deal of      caution. Some people, for example, might have allergic      reactions to otherwise "safe" plants, and a number of      factors-including the time of collection and method      of preparation-can make a big difference in both the      safety and the palatability of many free foods. You should      never, of course, pick plants close to roadways, polluted      waterways, croplands, or any other place where chemical      sprays or fumes could have contaminated them.<br />      Furthermore, the forager should never eat a plant that      looks unhealthy, or one that he or she can't identify      beyond the shadow of a doubt. Whenever my survival school      students collect wild edibles, I ask them whether they'd      stake their lives on their ability to identify the species      at hand . . . because that, in fact, is just what they'll      be doing when they eat it. So use a good Held manual on the      subject . . . preferably one that contains both sketches      and photographs showing leaf, root, flower, and stalk      structure, and-when possible-get some training      from a wild-plants expert in your area (both the common      names of and, surprisingly, the <em>appearance</em> of some      plants will change from one locale to another).    </p>    <p>      <strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong><br />      A person in a survival situation will likely find that      roots and tubers are most easily gathered with a "digging      stick" (a sturdy branch pointed at one end). When working      in rocky soil, it's a good idea to fire-harden the point by      heating-but not burning-it over glowing coals.      The digger is then pushed into the ground next to the      plant, and the root is levered out.    </p>    <p>      To collect seeds, tie a shirt in the form of a bag      (wrapping the sleeves around the neck hole to close it) ...      place the seed heads in the sack . . . and shake the      kernels loose. Or, you might want to make a willow hoop out      of a flexible sapling and place the shirt over it to form a      shallow tray into which seeds can be knocked off.    </p>    <p>      Finally, keep in mind that plants are living entities      and-many people believe-have their own spirits.      Whenever I pick one, I thank it for giving its life to keep      me alive. And, of course, we must all be very careful not      to wipe out a species in any one area.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BIG FOUR . . .</strong><br />      These food sources are both familiar to most folks      and-across much of North America-abundant!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oaks.</strong> All acorns ( <em>Quercus</em>      species) are edible, though some are a good bit sweeter      than others. However, if you simply shell one of the seeds      and take a bite, it's likely that you'll immediately be      turned off by the very astringent, burning quality typical      of most oak nuts. Fortunately, you can leach out the tannic      acid that makes them bitter, and the easiest way to do so      is to shell the acorns, smash them (you'll want to break      them up but <em>not</em> pulverize them), wrap the pieces      in a cloth, and place them in a stream for about half a day      (longer, if they haven't lost their unpleasant taste by      that time). Another method is to boil the nuts, changing      the water frequently, until the flavor appeals to you.    </p>    <p>      Once they're leached, the acorns can be eaten raw, toasted,      added to stews, or pounded fine and mixed with wild-grain      flours to make bread. They're a valuable source of proteins      and carbohydrates that's available from early fall until      well into the next spring. And acorn <em>sprouts</em> can      be prepared in the same ways as the nuts themselves,      or-in the case of most white oak species-can be      eaten right off the ground.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grasses.</strong> Of the many grasses found in      North America, all but a few are edible, with their seeds      being the most palatable part. However, it's best to select      grasses with large seed heads or clusters, since trying to      collect small ones would likely be a waste of vital energy.    </p>    <p>      The seeds should be dried and parched, then winnowed to      remove the chaff. The kernels can then be toasted and eaten      plain, added to stews, or ground into flour for bread. Some      of the best, safest, and most widely available grasses are      crab, goose, foxtail, blue, rye, and orchard, plus wild      oats and millet. <em>Eat the Weeds</em> by Ben Harris      (Keats, 1973, $1.50) <em>and Handbook of Edible Wild      Plants</em> by Euell Gibbons and Gordon Tucker (Donning      Company, 1979, $4.95) are both good sources of information      on edible grasses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pines.</strong> Not all evergreens are edible, but      the <em>Pinus</em> (pine) species are. These trees offer a      wide assortment of munchables that are all easily collected      and prepared. You can, for instance, add the pollen to stew      as a thickener and to bread for flavor. And if you heat the      cones gently by a fire until they open, the seeds can be      easily extracted. These can then be eaten raw, parched and      winnowed, or shelled and baked-depending on the      species-and added to soup and bread. Use pine needles      (along with those from spruce and hemlock . . . but be sure      you're not gathering the needles from the red-berried,      <em>poisonous</em> American yew, <em>Taxus canadensis</em>      ) to make a nourishing tea. You can also dry the inner bark      of pine, spruce (Picea species), and hemlock ( <em>Tsuga      canadensis</em> ) and add it to stew and bread.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cattails.</strong> The cattail (either <em>Typha      latifolia</em> or <em>T. angustifolia</em> ) can be      utilized at almost any time of the year, because at each      stage of its life cycle it has a number of edible parts.      For example, you can mash the root up in cold water to      separate the soluble starches, and-once these have      settled, and the fibers and water have been      removed-add the material to stew or mix it with other      wild flours to make bread. The new shoots can be eaten raw,      and those up to a foot tall may be prepared like asparagus.      The head, before it emerges, can be cooked and eaten like      corn on the cob. Finally, it's possible to collect cattail      pollen for use in soup or as a flour.    </p>    <p>      <strong>. . . AND MANY MORE</strong><br />      Clover. Many clovers ( <em>Trifolium</em> species) are      edible, the best being the red, sweet, yellow, white, white      sweet, buffalo, alsike, and crimson varieties. Boil or      steam the flowers and new green leaves and eat them as you      would spinach. Tea made from the dried flowers is also      relatively high in food value.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mint.</strong> Most members of the mint family (      <em>Mentha</em> species) can be used as tea or provide      flavoring for other foods and drinks. For example, you can      steep the green (or dried) leaves for a short time in hot      water and add the liquid directly to a stew.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Spicebush.</strong> The spicebush ( <em>Lindera      benzoin</em> ) is the forerunner of our modern allspice,      and the pioneers dried and powdered its berries to make a      versatile flavoring. For a zesty tea, steep its bark, young      twigs, and young leaves in warm water for about ten      minutes. (This beverage is flavorful, but its food value is      quite low.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Miner's Lettuce.</strong> The <em>Montia</em>      species (which belong to the same      family-Portulacaceae-as purslane, another      popular edible green) are available during much of the      year, and these typically small, low-growing residents of      damp places make a good cooked vegetable. It's also      possible to eat them raw or add them to soup and stew. (The      new, small leaves have the best flavor.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sumac.</strong> All of the <em>Rhus</em> species      are edible, with the exception of poison sumac, which can      be distinguished from the others by its loose clusters of      white berries and the absence of teeth on the leaves. To      make a good tea or cold drink from the bright red      stag-horn, smooth, and winged sumac berries, just bruise      the clusters in cold water ... let the brew sit for ten      minutes . . . strain it ... and drink the beverage hot or      cold. You can also make a fine soup with a fruity flavor by      heating the berry clusters and then straining them out      before eating the broth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Violets.</strong> The new, green leaves of the      <em>Viola</em> species can be cooked as a green, added to      soup as a thickener, or eaten raw in a salad. The dried      leaves, on the other hand, make excellent tea that's high      in vitamin A. The violet's taste, however, is very bland,      and the leaves will be most appealing when mixed with other      greens.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dandelions.</strong> You can eat the tender leaves      of <em>Taraxacum officinale</em> raw or cook them like a      potherb . . . if they're gathered before the plants bloom.      The mature flower itself is tasty when dipped in a batter      made from wild-grain flour and fried like a fritter, while      ground dried roots make an excellent hot drink.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chicory.</strong> When dried, roasted, and ground,      chicory ( <em>Cichorium intybus</em> ) roots will brew up      into a coffeelike hot drink, and the new green leaves can      be cooked as a potherb or simply added to stew. Also, the      blanched white part of the new leaves at the plant's base      are tasty when eaten raw . . . alone or in a salad.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Greenbriers.</strong> The new green leaves,      sprouts, or shoots-as well as the young      tendrils-of the <em>Smilax</em> species can be eaten      raw or cooked. In many parts of the country, greenbriers      have edible parts from spring through the middle of autumn.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stinging Nettles.</strong> The stinging nettle (      <em>Urtica</em> species) is a very good survival plant,      since it can be found in many areas of the country. Steam      or boil the young shoots or leaves to produce a great      cooked green. Or boil the older leaves for ten minutes,      then strain out the fibers, to make a tea. Be careful,      however, when handling this plant: Its "bite" is very      painful, but fortunately, the stinging capability is      destroyed by cooking. (The plant's stem fibers, by the way,      make good cordage.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Roses.</strong> It's possible to steep the fresh      petals of the Rosa species in hot water to make a very      tasty tea. Also, the dried and pitted rose hips can be      eaten raw and make an excellent survival food, because they      can often be found throughout the winter and are packed      with vitamin C.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Great Burdock.</strong> The young green leaves of      <em>Arctium lappa</em> can be eaten raw or prepared as a      potherb for a quick survival food. The roots of first-year      plants must be peeled of their inedible rind, and can then      be boiled-in two changes of water-for 30 to 40      minutes and eaten like potatoes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Amaranth.</strong> You can roast and grind the      seeds of the mature plants of <em>Amaranthus</em> species      into a rich flour. The young leaves can be eaten raw, added      to other cooked vegetables, or put directly in stew. (This      food source is available, in many areas, from spring      through fall.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Waterlilies.</strong> Almost all waterlilies (      <em>Nymphaea</em> and <em>Nuphar</em> species) are edible      and can be gathered most of the year. During the summer      months, when the rootstocks become mushy and rather      tasteless, they're still an excellent source of survival      food. Additionally, the young, unfurling leaves and      unopened buds can be prepared as a potherb. The seeds can      be parched, winnowed, and ground into a nutritious flour,      and the potato-shaped tubers of the tuberous waterlily (N.      tuberosa) can be dug from the mud and prepared      like-what else?-potatoes. Two of the more      common edible varieties are the yellow pond lily and the      fragrant pond lily. (Be careful, though, to collect any      such plants from pollution-free waters!)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Arrowhead.</strong> Use a forked stick to push the      tubers of this marsh plant ( <em>Sagittaria</em> species)      free of the mud, after which they'll float to the surface.      Though these can be cooked like potatoes, many people      prefer to eat them raw, as a nibble food. The arrowhead is      an excellent survival edible because it's available      throughout the year, but the roots do get bitter and soft      in midsummer and are especially so when the plant is in      flower.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chickweeds.</strong> Chickweeds of the      <em>Stellaria</em> and <em>Cerastium</em> species make very      good cooked greens, and all but the mouse-eared type can be      eaten raw (although some people don't care much for the      taste).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Common Plantains.</strong> When steamed or boiled,      the tender young leaves of the <em>Plantago</em> species      can be eaten as a cooked vegetable or added to soup and      stew. The very young, unfurling leaves are sometimes eaten      raw. Then, too, I like to grind the parched and winnowed      seeds into wild flour that has a distinctive taste and a      healthful dose of protein.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Prickly Pear.</strong> This fruit's fleshy pulp      makes an excellent trail-side food. The seeds of the      <em>Opuntia</em> species can also be parched and ground      into Hour, and the young pads-peeled-can be      eaten raw or fried.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Winter Cress.</strong> You can eat the winter      rosettes of <em>Barbarea vulgaris</em> raw or add them to      salads, but the leaves of the spring plants must be      prepared as a potherb to rid them of their bitter taste. If      cooked before they bloom, the flower heads resemble      broccoli, but might require two changes of water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TAKE A SHOPPING TRIP!</strong><br />      The plants described here represent just a small sampling      of the many valuable and often delicious vegetables that      can be found growing wild. Get yourself a good field guide      and take advantage of summer walks to sharpen your      identification skills.    </p>    <p>      Foraging is a rewarding and enjoyable family activity, as      well as an emergency technique . . . and it will allow you      to add variety to your meals while lowering your grocery      bills!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: As a basic resource, MOTHER'S staffers      heartily recommend Lee Peterson's</em> A Field Guide to      Edible Wild Plants, <em>which is available in many      libraries and bookstores. . . or-for $10.95 plus      95 cents shipping and handling-from Mother's      Bookshelf(restricted), P.O.
