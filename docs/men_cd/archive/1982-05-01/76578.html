                    <p>		 If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us about it in around 500 words (write to THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville,      North Carolina 28791): Be we to mention when and where you      started your venture and with how much "seed money", what      you make (net), and anything else that might be of      assistance to other entrepreneurs. If your story is used in      this column, you'll receive [I] the satisfaction of knowing      that you may help someone else start a business and [2] a      free two-year new or renewal subscription to THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS (restricted) .			</p>    <p>      I have a bootstrap business that I can "pick up" anytime I      need it ... by simply picking up a tack hammer and staple      gun that I've already paid for.    </p>    <p>      My enterprise was born, many years ago, when my father      asked my sister and me to reupholster a couple of old      sofas. Well, we balked at the idea, but he said, "If you      put your mind to it, you can do anything anyone else can      do, and being female has nothing to do with it!" To make a      long story short, we did refinish the two couches, and they      both turned out great!    </p>    <p>      That began my upholstering career, and-as I      said-I'm still at it (when I need to be) some 20      years later. And, though Dad inspired me to start the      business, MOM has kept me going! Such pieces as "It Pays to      Be an Old Sew-and-Sew" (No. 48, page 64) and Maria      Bachman's letter describing her stitchery service (issue      69, page 154) have really helped to reaffirm my faith in      the power of this particular individual to take care of      herself <em>and</em> provide extras for her family . . .      without having to hold down a "regular" job.    </p>    <p>      For example, my son recently needed surgery at a hospital      nearly 200 miles from home. So during my stay in that town,      while he was hospitalized, I bought an old sofa for $45,      reupholstered it, and sold it for $500. That certainly      helped us get the budget back in balance!    </p>    <p>      I can find the sort of work I do almost anytime,      and-since my customers, as a rule, supply both      furniture <em>and</em> fabric-the cost of the tools I      mentioned has been my only investment: one tack hammer, 25      <em> cents</em> (at a flea market) . . . and one electric      stapler, $19.95. Armed with that equipment, my dad's      advice, and MOTHER'S wisdom, I guess I was bound to      succeed.    </p>    <p>      Jan Worley<br />      Murphy, N.C.    </p>    <p>      My story really began back in 1979 with the arrival of a      bundle of assorted issues of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted)      sent by an old American friend. My husband Brian and I had      long been interested in growing herbs and "old time"      cottage garden perennials, but "Start a Home Business With      Herbs!" (issue 56, page 56) gave us enough confidence to      actually set up a similar enterprise of our own. We began      selling both plants and seeds (collected from our older      established herbs) and soon had built a small but steady      income . . . which we used to buy seeds of rarer varieties      of herbs and wildflowers.    </p>    <p>      At this point our whole business venture changed      directions, though. Several of MOM'S articles on wild foods      really caught our interest, and-since many of the      plants described in them were unobtainable in our neck of      the woods-we started tracking down seed companies      that <em>sold</em> the North American wildlings.    </p>    <p>      Soon we had such a demand for the seed-started "new" plants      that we were unable to satisfy all the requests, and      decided to try another approach. We bought a secondhand      photocopier (it set us back $350), paper, and a filing      system ($120) and started producing a small booklet listing      all of our plant sources. We offered the little catalog for      sale to those who inquired about the plants.    </p>    <p>      Then we began scouting out sources for Australia's      <em>own</em> edible and useful flora. Gradually we became      involved in the business of indexing mail order suppliers      of edible, useful, and exotic herbs, shrubs, and trees from      all over the world . . . and publishing that information in      a series of directories for both local and foreign      customers.    </p>    <p>      Although we definitely haven't abandoned the plant      business, we're now also a thriving information service,      answering all kinds of inquiries about Australia itself:      questions about land, jobs, houses, rural and alternative      communities, courses, workshops, magazines, books,      holidays, and more. We're earning about $120 per week of      part-time work now, and expect to turn a tidy profit this      year, though we always try to keep our prices low.    </p>    <p>      You can obtain details concerning all of our available      directories and services for $2.00, refundable with your      first order.    </p>    <p>      Margaret & Brian Holland<br />      Holco Information Services<br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      20 Stephens Rd.<br />      Queanbeyan, N.S.W. 2620<br />      Australia    </p>    <p>      Babies are my bootstrap business! Two years ago I came face      to face with the fact that our one-income family was really      taking a beating from double-digit inflation. Every      month-despite our savings plan, vegetable garden, and      coupon clipping-we faced a negative cash balance. We      felt that we were in a last-resort situation . . . and that      I'd have to go to work. The idea of leaving my two children      (both less than five years old) with strangers and of      facing a working world I had not been a part of for over      four years frightened me, but we seemed to have no choice.    </p>    <p>      Then, when I began to evaluate my marketability, things      looked gloomier still: My education consisted of two meager      years of college and no technical training ... I had no      office skills other than a little personal-use typing . . .      and my employment history was limited to waitress and      nurse's aide work. Hot oatmeal cookies, a long history of      magically repairing broken dolls, and a soothing way with      banged-up knees were not impressive job credentials. I      found myself labeled "unskilled" in a highly specialized      society.    </p>    <p>      On top of that, I had to face the frustrating scarcity of      day-care centers and the outrageous fees and long waiting      lists at nursery schools . . . and I hadn't even begun to      figure out the expense of commuting and of buying a      "career" wardrobe. My paycheck would likely be pretty much      swallowed up by the added outlay, even if I <em>could</em>      find an employer who'd take a chance on me!    </p>        <p>      But wait! I had once read an article, in MOTHER, about a      woman who operated a business while caring for her own tots      ("Mother Types at Home", issue 54, page 80). And I suddenly      realized that I could provide a salable service from      <em>my</em> house. After all, I'm fairly calm in the face      of child-induced chaos, I love to read stories aloud, and I      wield a mean crayon! Furthermore, I <em>wanted</em> to stay      with my kids . . . and I knew there must be other parents      as discouraged about finding good, reasonably priced      child-care facilities as I'd been.    </p>    <p>      The rules and regulations for starting such an enterprise      didn't prove to be too imposing, either. I was required to      plug all of my home's electrical outlets, install      childproof latches, and obtain a letter from our doctor      certifying the health of the whole family. Then the fire      marshall came to inspect our woodstove and chimney . . .      and I was in business.    </p>    <p>      A single classified ad soon brought me all the children I      could handle, and quite a sizable waiting list to boot. My      fee is $1.25 an hour per child, which includes lunch and a      snack. (The prices for extras-such as breakfast or      birthday parties-are negotiated separately.)      Operating costs for my home-based business are limited to      food (about $20 a week) and taxes and insurance ($30 a      week).    </p>    <p>      Now, I'm able to raise my own preschoolers myself,      <em>and</em> provide them with a wide variety of new      playmates. Best of all, though, I've found that there's a      real <em>need</em> for what I'm good at ... and that, by      doing it, I can bring in a paycheck of about $190 a week.    </p>    <p>      Marcia Beebe<br />      Mystic, Conn.    </p>
