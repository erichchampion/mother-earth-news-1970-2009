        <p>Here's just one more of the good things that'll be going on at the Eco-Village this summer.</p><p>From August 14 to 16, 1982, Mother's Chapters will meet for their first annual national convention. This gathering-to be held at our lovely Eco-Village property here in the cool mountains of North Carolina-is scheduled at a time that's just before most children have to return to school, and should be a real end-of-summer treat for chapter members and their families.</p><p>Although the plans are still being finalized, here's a sneak preview of just a <em>few</em> of the many events that'll take place during the exciting long weekend. First of all, upon arrival, you-as a chapter member-will be permitted to camp free of charge on MOM'S property for the duration of the convention. The first day will be spent getting acquainted with fellow members and gathering to share the experiences you've all had during your groups' first year. You'll also have the opportunity to meet and talk with the folks at our national chapters headquarters . . . and spend time with some of the writers and researchers who put this magazine together. After that, various chapters will-if time and scheduling allow -give presentations of their most successful projects. The day will end with a hot-dog roast, at which you'll listen (and dance!) to live traditional mountain music.</p><p>At 10:00 a.m. on the second day, after spending some free time browsing through Mother's Bookshelf (restricted) and visiting the exhibits at the Eco-Village, you'll be admitted (again, free of charge) to the Show-Hows. These hour long (or more) mini-seminars will cover the whole range of topics presented in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) . . . subjects like earth-sheltered housing, biodynamic/French intensive gardening, and alcohol fuel production (to name just a few). The choice of which seminars you attend will, of course, be up to you . . . and, if you prefer, you can just walk about the grounds instead (perhaps hiking along one of our clearly marked trails) and enjoy their natural beauty. Either way, after a long day of exploring the Eco-Village from one end to the other, it's going to be a real treat to sit back and enjoy (or <em>participate</em> in) the homegrown entertainment that'll make up MOTHER'S first "Chapter Talent Show". (Come prepared to give us your best, because the grand prize will be a free trip to the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee!)</p><p>On the third morning (Monday), at 7:00 a.m., you'll have the option of boarding a bus for a scenic trip through the mountains to Knoxville, where you'll spend a full day at the World's Fair . . . the theme of which -appropriately enough-is the future of world energy. Members who choose to go must pay for this trip, however, and the fees are as follows: adults, $30 each . . . senior citizens (65 +) and Lifetime Subscribers, $29 each . . . and persons under 21, $28 each (children three years old and under get free lap space).</p><p>If you like these summer plans for our chapter members and want to participate in this special program, <em>it's very important that you let us know as soon as possible</em>. Just mark the appropriate box on the accompanying coupon ... if you are now a member or are signing up to become one.</p><p>Do your best to make it... we're going to knock ourselves out to be sure that all who attend will get <em>more</em> than they'd planned!</p>
