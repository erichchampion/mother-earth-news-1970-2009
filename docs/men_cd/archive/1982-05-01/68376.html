Harris, Jr., who is the author of a Brief      Guide to Snakebite (Preston Publications).</em>    </p>    <p>      Few creatures are as universally feared as poisonous      serpents, but the fact is that snakebite is a far cry from      the "certain death" that many people consider it to be. To      begin with, the chances of being bitten by any      snake-venomous or not-are slim.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the only available statistics on the effects      of venomous snakebite are nearly 20 years old and thus      outdated, but if the ratio recorded then still holds true,      only one bite in 3,000 is likely to be fatal, while some      10% to 20% produce no effect whatsoever, even if the      snake's fangs do penetrate the skin! Fatalities occur most      often when elderly people, individuals who are ill, or      small children are bitten ... or when a person who is      struck receives no treatment. Authorities estimate      that-in the U.S.-there are no more than 12 to      15 deaths from snakebite per year at present.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS</strong><br />      The best way to deal with snakebite is, of course, to avoid      getting bitten in the first place. And perhaps the best way      to do <em>that</em> is to know the various serpents and      recognize their preferred habitats.    </p>    <p>      Of the four venomous snake types in the U.S.,      three-the various water moccasins, copperheads, and      rattlesnakes-are pit vipers and share some common      characteristics. All have [a] a pit-or      hole-between the eye and nostril, which is      heat-sensitive and helps the snake locate prey (these      reptiles are also very responsive to vibrations, but can't      actually "hear"), [b] vertical pupils in their eyes, [c]      wedge-shaped heads that are wider than their necks, and [d]      hinged poison fangs that lie flat against the roof of the      mouth when the jaws are closed, then snap forward and erect      when the mouth is opened. In addition, all three have a      venom that's destructive to blood and tissue and produces      symptoms within a few minutes after being injected.    </p>    <p>      The most common pit viper in the United States, and the      poisonous snake responsible for the greatest number of      bites, is the <em>rattlesnake</em> . There are      approximately 20 species and subspecies of rattlers: Some      are light, some dark, some marked with diamonds, while      others are blotched or banded . . . but all may be      recognized by the horny string of interlocking, loosely      fitted rattles at the end of the tail. When vibrated      rapidly, these rattles produce a distinctive buzzing sound,      but-contrary to legend-the snake may or may      <em>not</em> choose to vibrate its tail when disturbed.      Chief among this group of reptiles are the eastern and      western diamondbacks, which are large and capable of      injecting a sizable amount of poison with one bite.    </p>    <p>      The <em>copperhead</em> is, by some standards, a rather      handsome snake . . . and the <em>only</em> one in the U.S.      whose hourglass markings are positioned with the      constricted portion of the design down the midline of its      back, as though someone had bent the hourglass across its      spine and down on either side. The color can vary from      almost pink to dark chestnut brown, with only some      specimens having the bright copper-colored head that gives      the species its common name.    </p>    <p>      The <em>cottonmouth</em> , or <em>water moccasin</em> , is      a heavy-bodied snake with a reputation for bad temper. It's      difficult to identify quickly because its markings tend to      become indistinct with age. Besides having the usual pit      viper characteristics, the cottonmouth has a broad, dark      band extending from the nostril through the eye to the      angle of the jaw on either side of the head. The interior      of the mouth has a white "cottony" lining that's visible      when the snake gapes threateningly at an intruder. Unlike      other water snakes, the cottonmouth swims with its head      well above the surface, but it can bite just as easily      <em>under</em> the water as out of it.    </p>    <p>      The <em>coral snake</em> (which is the fourth poisonous      type in the United States, and the only one that's not a      pit viper) is easily seen . . . but just as easily      misidentified. There are, you see, at least three other      serpents with similar markings-the scarlet snake, the      organpipe shovel-nosed snake, and the milk snake-all      of which are harmless. The venomous species is slender and      black-nosed, with bands of red bordered in <em>yellow</em>      and black strips between the red and yellow circlets.      Although the old rhyme doesn't tell the whole story, "red      and yellow kill a fellow . . . red and black venom lack"      can be a useful adage.    </p>    <p>      Coral snakes are related to the kraits and cobras of Asia      and have a highly virulent neurotoxic venom that may not      produce symptoms for several hours ... by which time it may      be more difficult to treat the victim. Unlike the pit      vipers, these reptiles have poison fangs that are fixed,      rather than hinged, in the jaw. The fangs are smaller than      those of pit vipers, too, and coral snakes must chew in      order to inject their poison. Fortunately, they are      typically un-aggressive and relatively uncommon. ("The      chances of being struck by lightning are probably 20 times      greater than those of being struck by a coral snake,"      declares one eminent authority.) Nevertheless, to be on the      safe side, it's best to give any brightly banded serpent a      wide berth.<br />      Regardless of which of the four venomous snake types may      live in your area, it's important to keep in mind that      woods and meadows, or even tumbledown buildings, could well      be "home" to poisonous serpents. At one time the reptiles      were typically found in areas of low population density . .      . but that's no longer always the case. Rapidly expanding      suburbs have usurped some of their old territory, crowding      the creatures into larger groups . . . sometimes in small,      often recreational, patches of land surrounded by houses.      And snakes whose natural inclination is to live on rock      ledges and in mountainside scree slopes may find similar      refuges in building foundations.    </p>        <p>      <strong>READ A BITE SIGNATURE</strong><br />      Sometimes the only way to accurately determine whether a      bite is that of a poisonous snake is by examining the      pattern of the tooth marks, so it's best to learn what to      look for <em>before</em> you need that knowledge. Harmless      serpents usually have four rows of teeth in the upper jaw      and two rows in the lower . . . while venomous types lack      the two outside rows in the upper jaw and have, instead,      two large poison fangs in the front of the mouth. The      accompanying sketch illustrates a <em>full</em> tooth print      of each variety, but in an actual bite only a portion of      the print is likely to show. If a poisonous snake has      bitten someone, however, one or both fang marks      <em>will</em> almost always be visible, as will perhaps a      few of the smaller teeth.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, the bite may be quite bloody even though the      tooth punctures are minute: Snake saliva contains an      anticoagulant, which causes the blood to flow freely for      some minutes after a bite. (This actually cleanses the      wound of bacteria and reduces the likelihood of infection.)      Rinse the blood off with water to see the bite pattern, but      <em>do not use kerosene, alcohol, or any other such      liquids</em> , as they can compound the problems that the      bite itself may cause.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SAFETY FIRST</strong><br />      Another aspect of snakebite prevention lies in taking      precautions when traveling through known serpent habitat.      If at all possible, follow these rules:    </p>    <p>      [1] <em>Before</em> going out in the field, find out the      name, address, and phone number of a physician competent in      the treatment of snakebite (remember that not all doctors      are equally familiar with these procedures).    </p>    <p>      [2] Don't travel alone in snake country. The usual rule is      to stay in groups of no less than three. If one person is      hurt, the second can stay to care for the victim while the      third goes for help.    </p>    <p>      [3] Wear proper clothing. Don't select shorts or tight      jeans . . . baggy pants are definitely safer than snug ones      (after all, it's better to have a striking snake get a      mouthful of britches than a bite of you). And although      hiking shoes do provide some protection, high boots are      better. The latter may be uncomfortably hot in the      summertime, but they're a <em>must</em> in areas that are      known to be heavily infested.    </p>    <p>      [4] Always be aware of where you're putting your hands and      feet. Never reach <em>up</em> and <em>over</em> a ledge      when climbing ... if you can't see the surface, you can't      be sure it's unoccupied. And don't sit down on a log or the      ground without checking the area carefully, or step      completely <em>over</em> a log in the path . . . instead,      step on top of it first. Not even a snake likes to have a      foot planted on its spine, and it may express      dissatisfaction by sinking its fangs into your leg.    </p>    <p>      [5] Be sure that you're familiar with the basic first aid      procedure for snakebite before you need it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOTCHA!</strong><br />      Of course, regardless of how careful you are, there's      always a slim chance that you'll be bitten. Therefore, you      ought to know what to do if the unlikely should happen.    </p>    <p>      The <em>first</em> thing to do is keep calm. Naturally,      that's more easily said than done, and it will probably      take all your will power to accomplish it in the face of      the shock and fright a bite will cause, but it's      <em>vitally</em> important. Increased activity and fear      make the heart beat faster, speeding the venom-if any has      indeed been injected-through your system.    </p>    <p>      Second, if you can see that the striking snake is one of a      venomous variety, or if you really aren't sure, kill      it-be <em>certain</em> it's dead-and take it      with you to the hospital. A physician who knows the size      and species of serpent involved can administer the correct      kind and amount of antivenin.    </p>    <p>      Third, check the bite pattern. If you find fang marks (or      can't be sure there aren't any), apply some kind of      constricting band -such as a shoelace, bandanna,      fishline, or whatever you can find-between the bite      and the heart. Place it close to the bitten area <em>if      you're doing so immediately after being struck</em> . This      will serve to localize the venom as much as possible: The      body can actually detoxify a certain amount of foreign      material if it can be allowed to leak <em>slowly</em> to      the vital areas. The tourniquet should be just tight enough      to allow the insertion of two fingers between the bandage      and the body . . . and it should be left on, without      loosening, for up to an hour or even an hour and a half.    </p>    <p>      Fourth, if you've identified the snake or the bite as      venomous (or, again, if you're not sure) <em>get to a      doctor as soon as possible</em> . In general, bad bites      will produce symptoms within minutes. These signs include      swelling, purpling, and a painful burning sensation . . .      but remember that coral snake bites, which may not show      clear symptoms for several hours, must also be treated      quickly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUT HOW QUICK IS QUICKLY?</strong><br />      There's considerable controversy over the treatment of      venomous snakebites, much of which is caused by the fact      that a great number of variables can affect the bite's      severity. Among these are the age and body size of the      victim, the species and size of the snake, the time of      year, the section of the snake's geographical range where      the strike occurred, the number of bites, their location,      the depth of fang penetration, the length of time the snake      held on, the amount of venom injected, the sensitivity of      the victim to the venom, the kinds of bacteria in the      snake's mouth, the condition and disposition of the snake      at the time, and the effectiveness and type of first aid      treatment.    </p>    <p>      At least one widely respected authority believes that any      venomous snakebite must be treated within 30 minutes for      the victim to be relatively sure of recovery. Another feels      that a person can usually stand a delay -if      necessary-of two to four hours before risking serious      consequences. All agree that the victim should be taken to      a doctor or a hospital as <em>rapidly as possible</em> so      that antivenin can be administered.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A BIT ABOUT ANTIVENIN</strong><br />      There are two kinds of snake antivenin commonly      available-to doctors, or through prescription      only-in the United States. Both are manufactured by      the Wyeth Laboratory in Philadelphia, both are very      expensive, and both can be dangerous in the hands of a      nonprofessional. "Antivenin (Crotalidae) Polyvalent" is      effective in the treatment of all kinds of pit viper bites,      including those of the fer-de-lance and formidable      bushmaster of South America. "Antivenin ( <em>Micrurus      fulvius</em> )" is used for the bites of the eastern and      Texas coral snakes. If authorities disagree on some aspects      of snakebite treatment, they are all in accord when it      comes to the matter of antivenin: It is not for use by a      layperson.    </p>    <p>      Antivenin is a chemical counterbalance to the powerful      toxins in snake poison. It is prepared from the blood of a      horse as a dehydrated serum product, and there's the      possibility that a given individual may be allergic to      horse serum . . . perhaps as a result of previous tetanus      inoculations, which are also prepared from that material.      Such a man or woman could experience a fatal reaction upon      being treated. In very severe cases of snakebite a      physician may elect to use the serum in spite of a victim's      positive reaction to a sensitivity test, but would then be      prepared to treat the allergy symptoms as they developed .      . . using all of the medical equipment at his or her      disposal.    </p>    <p>      The amount of antivenin needed will vary from case to case.      It's packaged in 10-cc. vials, and anywhere from 5 to 30      vials (in rare cases even more) are used to treat the bite      of a diamondback rattlesnake, while a coral snake bite      requires at least 3. Administration of the serum is a      complicated procedure involving several steps . . . and a      great deal of care.    </p>    <p>      Medical attention is also needed for the aftereffects of a      bite. These may include considerable tissue destruction,      and a doctor will have to remove this dead flesh within a      week or so. In the meantime a broad-spectrum antibiotic is      usually given to prevent serious infection. Active exercise      of the bitten part, as it begins to heal, can help prevent      deformation.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, in view of both the dangers and expense involved      in treatment <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: As of this writing, the      prices of antivenin at our local pharmacy in      Hender-sonville are as follows: pit viper antivenin,      $40/vial, coral snake antivenin, $60/vial]</em> , it's      clear that snakebite <em>prevention</em> is of the greatest      importance!    </p>    <p>      <strong>A RUNDOWN ON THE DO NOTS</strong><br />      Finally, you should know specifically what to      <em>avoid</em> doing if you're bitten. Here are a few of      the most important don'ts:    </p>    <p>      First, do not make an incision and attempt suction of the      wound. This once-recommended treatment often results in cut      nerves, tendons, and blood vessels with attendant infection      . . . and does little good in removing the poison.    </p>    <p>      Second, do not put the bitten limb in ice or use      <em>any</em> form of cooling. This procedure, which was      formerly thought to retard the spread of venom, has been      responsible for the permanent deformation or amputation of      many arms and legs.    </p>    <p>      Third, do not eat or drink prior to treatment, since doing      so tends to speed up the body's circulation.    </p>    <p>      Fourth, and perhaps most important of all, do not assume      the worst! The curator of reptiles in one of our finest      zoos believes that possibly 50% of all venomous snakebites      actually have no toxic effect. He speaks from experience:      Bitten three times by various pit vipers, he has had a      reaction only once (and that, incidentally, resulted from      the bite of a cottonmouth that was "safely" impounded in a      heavy canvas catch bag). "If it's a serious strike, you'll      know within a few minutes," he says. "And," adds a      pharmacist, "remember that there's scarcely a place in the      country where you can't get to a doctor in plenty of time."    </p>    <p>      So, follow the first aid procedures recommended here . . .      and keep calm.    </p>    <p>      <strong>USE COMMON SENSE</strong><br />      The quotation "the only thing we have to fear is fear      itself" may well be relevant to our dealing with snakes.      Poisonous serpents are fellow passengers on this old planet      and should be treated with respect and understanding. By      using our intelligence and employing a reasonable amount of      caution, there's no reason we shouldn't be able to enjoy      encounters with our remarkable neighbors-bringing      back, perhaps, memorable photographs-without getting      hurt.    </p>
