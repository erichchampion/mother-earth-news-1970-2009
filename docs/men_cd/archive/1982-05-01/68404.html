        <p><em>This couple designed and built a 1,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, three-story conical dwelling!</em></p><p><br />Clockwise from above, left: With the poles in place, the upper floors go in...Note how the green house and windows are framed...The finished triple-decker...Kon Tipi's interior.</p><p>PHOTOS BY THE AUTHOR</p><p>We've come to call our dwelling Kon Tipi because-as was Thor Heyerdahl's famous raft Kon Tiki-it's been an adventure both to build and to live in. Furthermore, since our construction costs totaled less than $1,500 <em>and</em> freed us from the treadmills of rent and mortgage, the unusual home is sure to help us ride out the rough waters of current and future economic storms.</p><p>Michael and I are convinced that anyone with modest building skills could duplicate our tipi, too (Mike <em>is</em> pretty handy with tools, but he took care of the entire job-with some help from me and our wonderful neighbors-in a scant two months). And a stubborn scrounger could certainly reduce the <em>cost</em> of constructing a similar house... by employing used insulation and salvaged lumber.</p><p><strong>STEP ONE: DISCOVERING THE COVERING</strong></p><p>A traditional native American tipi, as most of you surely know, has both an outer cover and a liner. In such a dwelling the inner wall extends from ground level to about six feet high, and is secured to the inside of the poles . . . creating an air space. We chose, however, to extend the liner all the way to the top, and to place both it and the cover <em>outside</em> the pole framework . . . with insulation sandwiched between the two walls.</p><p>On the average, tipis run from 18 to 20 feet in diameter. Kon Tipi, on the other hand, is a full 30 feet across and rises 30 feet to the point where its poles meet. In order to cover the structure twice (once for the outer wall and once for the lining), we had to purchase some 300 yards of 54"-wide fabric. After considering the advantages of various types of material, we settled on nylon reinforced vinyl . . . since it has an outdoor life of about 20 years, is waterproof, meets California's fire-resistance standards, won't rot or mildew, and is less expensive than treated canvas. ( <em>Untreated</em> canvas doesn't hold up well in moist climes . . . and the treatment process is costly if you pay someone else to do it, yet involves caustic chemicals that would influence many do-it-yourselfers to shy away from tackling the job.)</p><p>We bought our fabric from the Duracote Corporation (Dept. TMEN, 350 North Diamond Street, Ravenna, Ohio 44266). At that time, our 200 yards of 10-ounce, white Dura-Tuff 4932 (most of which was used for the outer wall) cost $2.65 per yard, while the 100 yards of a similar 6- <em>ounce</em> material (which, with the leftover heavier fabric, formed the liner) was priced at $2.07 per yard.</p><p>With the material purchased, we set to the task of assembling our tipi's skins. After cutting and numbering each length for the outer cover (following the pattern shown in Fig. 1), we glued the longest (68-foot) strip <em>over</em> the second (66-foot) length, using Bostik 7130 adhesive. It's very important to shingle each consecutive upper (long) section of fabric over the lower (shorter) piece that follows it, so that water will run over, and not into, the seams.</p><p>When it came to the actual gluing, we simply snapped a blue chalk line one inch from, and parallel to, one edge of each of the to-be-joined strips, then ran lines of glue along the chalked fabric. After brushing the adhesive out so that it covered the areas from the edges of the two sheets of material to the marked lines, we pressed the joints together, smoothed them with a roller, and wiped any excess glue away with clean rags. In all, it took us about 12 hours to assemble the outer wall.</p><p>Since we had quickly tired of the fumes produced by the glue (and because needle holes, which might have admitted moisture through the outer wall, weren't a concern in the inner covering), we decided to <em>sew</em> the liner together. The task required another 12 hours of work, using a double needle that produced two parallel seams about 1/4 inch apart. The only real problem we encountered was the tendency of the fabric to pucker . . . which made it necessary to hold the material securely, both in front of and behind the needle, as we stitched.</p><p><strong>STEP TWO: A VAULT OF POLES</strong><br />After the vinyl was assembled, folded, and stored, I pretty much turned Kon Tipi over to Michael . . . since I had to finish off two more months of city work before sailing into country life full time. Mike established a camp on our 20 rural acres and got right to the task of selecting and cutting poles. He chose, blessed, chopped, dragged, and peeled some 16 oaks, each about 35 feet in length and 4" to 6" at the base (after peeling). Once the poles were prepared, their lower ends were treated with wood preservative.</p><p>It was short work, then, to clear and level the 30-foot, circular homesite, after which Michael approached the intimidating task of actually raising the monstrous tripod that would form the core of the pole assembly. The job involved tying three trees together, at a point 30 feet from their bases, with one end of a strong 40-foot rope. Then he spread the butts of the poles apart . . . placing two together at one point on the perimeter of the prepared site, and the other (single) pole-also on the edge of the circle-roughly 25 feet away. (See Fig. 2 for a sketch of the pole-lifting procedure.)</p><p>With that done, Michael braced the bases of the logs in place with stakes . . . temporarily propped up the joint (where the three poles met) with a 10-foot length of 2 X 4. . . tied the free end of the rope to our truck . . . and pulled the framework high enough to allow him to grasp the base of one of the paired poles and swing it around the perimeter until the tripod stood on its own. He went on to place each log butt in its final spot by dropping a plumb line from the point at which they crossed to mark dead center of the 30-foot circle, and positioning each post exactly 15 feet from the center and equidistant from the two others. It was then a relatively simple matter to add the rest of the uprights and-climbing a ladder to do so-tie their tips to the tripod's joint.</p><p><strong>STEP THREE: FLOORS GALORE</strong><br />In order to make the best use of the space that would be enclosed by Kon Tipi's fabric walls, we decided to make it a three-story home (one of the accompanying photos shows the poles up and the floors under construction). Michael began the second floor by choosing two sturdy poles that were directly opposite (that is, 30 feet from) each other at their bases. He then measured the distance between the uprights at a height of 6'8" (it came to 22 feet), located a pair of 2 X 10's of that dimension, and nailed one of the planks to each side of the pair of poles (see Fig. 3). Parallel beams, getting progressively shorter as they approached the edges of the tipi, were added next. (These boards were used singly . . . only the initial span was doubled.)</p><p>Mike completed the framework by fastening 2 X 8 crossmembers to the joists at approximately 3-foot intervals. (Because of the shape of the tipi, these measurements had to be varied somewhat from one position to another.) He planked the floor with rough-cut 1" X 8" oak boards . . . leaving one quarter-section without flooring or crossbeams, to enhance ventilation, increase the dwelling's feeling of openness, and provide access for the stovepipe and stairway.</p><p>The third floor is simply a smaller version of the second . . . and our roof-which is positioned about 18 inches below the point where the posts cross-consists of 2 X 4 rafters and plywood cut to fit snugly around the poles. Now you might be wondering how we incorporated <em>upright</em> supports beneath our second and third floors and the roof, and you could well be surprised to learn that there are none! In fact, the <em>only</em> vertical walls in our dwelling are the ones that enclose the 5' X 8' bathroom (two bulkheads handle that job . . . both of which were framed with 2 X 4 studs and sheathed with oak boards).</p><p>The first floor is composed of sand, covered-in sequence-with heavy black plastic and loose oak planks. We left a 5' X 5' area bare, except for the sand and some large flat rocks, to provide a safe location for our woodstove. Of course, the ground floor <em>could</em> have been raised up on joists, and even insulated, but we were pressed for both time and money . . . and we can always go on to do a fancier job as our circumstances permit.</p><p><strong>STEP FOUR: SETTING THE SAIL</strong><br />While hanging the cover and liner on Kon Tipi, it was difficult not to imagine that we were unfurling the canvas on some ancient seagoing vessel. The huge expanse of fabric was really a sight to behold (and a real handful when the wind caught it). We began the job by tying a strong rope to the center of the liner's straight edge (at the point indicated in Fig. 1) and then raised the fabric, by means of a pulley attached to one of the poles. By standing on the roof, Michael was able to tack the liner to the framework at his feet, using lathe and roofing nails.</p><p>After smoothing the inner wall evenly around the tipi, we stapled rows of fiberglass insulation- <em>through</em> the liner-to the poles, starting from the bottom. Mike spent a full day getting that job done and hauling up the outside wall, but he had to work fast . . . since an unexpected downpour would have done real damage had it hit before the waterproof outer wrap was in place. (To handle the run-off from future rains, we dug a drainage trench on the high side of the tipi . . . and used the dirt removed while doing so to bury the bottom edges of the vinyl.)</p><p><strong>STEP FIVE: PORTS AND PORTALS</strong><br />Now most folks don't think of windows and doors when imagining tipi life, but we'd been able to salvage a number of panes and screens at no cost and were willing to experiment. As it turned out, cutting the openings for our viewports and entryway involved more by-guess-and-by-gosh figuring than did any other task we encountered.</p><p>To build the front door/window combination, for example, Michael first selected three poles on the east side of the tipi. He then cut through the vinyl and insulation, along the line of the middle pole, starting at a point 7 feet up and moving down to the ground. With that done, Mike sliced a horizontal gash, at the 7-foot mark, running from the first pole to the third. This "T" cut allowed him to fold back the vinyl and insulation.</p><p>Next, the entryway was framed in with 2 X 4's: First, 7-foot uprights were fastened to the bases of the three poles, followed by horizontal-or roof-line-planks . . . which were secured to the tipi poles at points 7 feet from the ground. Michael claimed that the job was sort of like constructing a dormer on a simple slanted roof, except for the fact that the tipi's curve made it a little more "interesting".</p><p>With the frames in place, Mike hinged the window to its upper border so that it could be pulled in and hooked to the entry ceiling on warm days. The door was set to open inward . . . the spaces below and beside the window were filled in with planks and insulation . . . the entry's 1/2" plywood roof was topped off with roofing paper, white roll roofing, and tar ... and the vinyl flaps were stapled to the frame. The whole job turned out to be easy enough to inspire Michael to go on and build dormer windows on each floor . . . plus the 5' X 10' greenhouse shown in one of the accompanying photos (which provides us with additional light, solar heat, and-of course-a way to assure ourselves a continual harvest of vegetables).</p><p><strong>SOME SUM!</strong><br />As you'd imagine, part of the satisfaction of building Kon Tipi came from knowing that our entire home was constructed for less money than most homebuilders would have to fork over while just putting in a foundation! Here's the final breakdown of our actual expenses:</p><p><br />We've been more comfortable in our "home in the round" than either Michael or I ever thought possible, too. And it's wonderful to know that, whatever future we may dream of and set sail toward in the years to come, Kon Tipi will help make "getting there" an adventure!</p><p><strong>SUBSCRIPTION PROBLEM?</strong></p><p><strong>Your answer may be here!</strong></p><p>Many subscription problems are only a need for information, so you may find your answer here without having to go to the trouble of writing to us:</p><p>If you have already paid or already renewed and you get another bill or another renewal notice from us, it is probably because it crossed in the mail with your payment or renewal.</p><p>We mail bills and renewal notices once a month. It usually takes about four days to prepare and mail your bill or renewal notice, five days for it to reach you, five days for your check or renewal order to come back to us, and four days to enter the transaction in your subscription record. That's a total of 18 days, even if you pay or renew on the very day you receive our reminder.</p><p>But if you wait two weeks before responding, for example, you can see that another bill or renewal notice would be on its way to you. So, if you have sent in your payment or renewal instructions and you receive another notice, please disregard the first notice you receive after you respond. But if you should receive a SECOND notice after you've responded, please return it with a note telling us so.</p><p>If you order a subscription, please allow about eight weeks for your first issue to arrive, and do NOT send us a second order in the meantime. Our computer would then enter that second subscription for you, too, and you would get two copies of each issue... plus another bill for the second order.</p><p>If you are already a subscriber and you receive a new subscriber's trial subscription offer from us, it is because we have arranged to use some other organization's mailing list. We try to omit our own subscribers' names, but sometimes it is not possible. If you do get such an offer from us, we would appreciate it if you would pass it along to interested friends and tell them to strike out your name and write in their own when they order.</p><p>If your magazines stop coming, we may not have received your payment or your renewal instructions ... or maybe they did not arrive early enough to avoid interruption in service ... or maybe your magazine was lost in the mail.</p><p>If you have moved and you are not now getting your magazines, it may be because we did not receive your change of address ... or you gave us your new address but not your old address, so we could not locate your subscription record to change it ... or you gave us your change of address but there wasn't enough time to change it before the next issue was mailed.</p><p>If you start getting two copies of each issue, compare the two mailing labels. They will be different. The differences may appear to be slight, but even slight differences are significant to the computer. Send us both labels and tell us which is correct. For example: J.R. Smith and J. Smith may be different people (father and son?). The computer cannot tell that Mary Thompson and Mrs. Charles Thompson are the same person, and neither can we. If we have a subscription going to 154 Maple but the new order shows it as 154 Maple Avenue, that city may have both a Maple Street and a Maple Avenue (maybe even in the same zip code area), so we may carry two subscriptions on our mailing list (and send out two copies) until notified.</p><p>If you have written to us before about a problem and did not receive a reply, probably the problem was such that we could solve it with the information you sent at first, so no further correspondence was needed. But it a response was indicated, it could be that we were unable to read your name and address ... or we may have made a mistake, or perhaps overlooked your note on the back of a renewal notice or invoice or other form ... or there was an error in your address or zip code ... or your name was not signed the way it is listed in our subscription records ... or we did not receive the numbers that appear with your name and address on your mailing label or billing invoice or renewal notice ... or your letter may have been on office stationery that did not show your subscription's address ... or not enough time was allowed for your letter to arrive, for us to process your request, and for the results of our action to get back to you.</p><p>We want to give you good service, and you can help. Your assistance and understanding will really be appreciated!</p><p>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted)<br />P.O.Box 70 Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791</p>
