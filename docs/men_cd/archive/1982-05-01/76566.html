                    <p>      <em>In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of humankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced      our still-standing offer: Anyone who sends us a short      account of an actual barter that gets printed in this      column (write THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791) will receive a      12-month subscription (new or extended) to MOTHER.</em>    </p>    <p>      My family used the old-time practice of bartering to obtain      the mountain cabin we'd always wanted but didn't have the      cash for. We had managed to save $500 to buy a small patch      of mountain land, and then collected used lumber from my      father's remodeling jobs. However, we just didn't have time      to build the cabin and clear the land ourselves (      <em>and</em> hold down full-time jobs to boot), nor could      we afford the cost of hiring a construction crew. We      suspected, however, that some of our handy acquaintances      would fairly jump at the chance to exchange a little labor      for the use of our cabin as a vacation hideaway or a      hunting camp . . . and we were right! Four of our friends      were quick to take us up on the offer.    </p>    <p>      Before we could put those people to work, though, we still      had to find a way to transport the salvaged building      materials from our present home to the land (a 150-mile      trek). So we decided to try barter again, and soon traded      the promise of a free week at the cabin-to-be to a fellow      who owned a trailer truck. He was able to haul all the      lumber to our site in one trip.    </p>    <p>      The use of our little dwelling has since been exchanged for      a mattress, some venison, several pieces of used furniture,      and help in constructing a boat dock. And best of all,      we're bartering away only cabin use during periods of time      when the building would otherwise be empty anyway!    </p>    <p>      <strong>J.M. Pennsylvania</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many people seem to feel that swapping is pretty much      confined to the rural areas of the country. Well, as a      confirmed city slicker, I'd like to help put an end to that      notion.    </p>    <p>      You see, my husband and I have-for <em>years</em>      now-been swapping our skilled labor for that of      others. For example, my spouse fixes friends' automobiles      in exchange for such services as help (from an accountant)      in preparing our income tax return, or-in another      instance-the installation of a new sink and a garbage      disposal in our home (a plumber buddy did that one). In      addition, I've traded tutoring in the three R's (Iâ€™m      a former teacher) for music and art lessons for my children      and me. Our nine-year-old son has gotten into the act too,      by offering his babysitting services to a neighbor who has      several small children ... in exchange for cross-country      skiing lessons.    </p>    <p>      We've recently begun trading for <em>products</em> as well.      Our two most successful deals resulted in our owning a boat      and motor! First, I swapped a no-longer-used washing      machine for an older-model boat which was still in good      condition. Then we exchanged a riding lawn mower (we didn't      need it on our small lot) for the outboard motor.    </p>    <p>      So, as you can see, bartering is alive and well in both      urban areas and rural realms . . . and we intend to      <em>keep</em> at it!    </p>    <p>      <strong>A.C.<br />      Washington</strong>    </p>    <p>      Not long ago, when I was in need of professional help with      the design for my dream house, I happened to meet a      MOTHER-type architect who, like me, is also an enthusiastic      amateur astronomy buff.    </p>        <p>      As our friendship grew, I invited the designer to my home      for an evening of stargazing . . . and discovered that my      new buddy didn't own a telescope. He eyed my homemade      'scope with obvious admiration, and complimented me by      saying that it was comparable in quality to some of the      commercial models he'd coveted.    </p>    <p>      Well, that was all the encouragement I needed! I suggested      a trade, and-as I'd hoped-the resulting deal      furnished my wife and me with a set of top-notch house      plans . . . while my friend can now "visit" nearby heavenly      bodies, aided by <em>his</em> home-built telescope,      whenever the mood strikes!    </p>    <p>      <strong>H.R. Texas</strong>    </p>    <p>      As recent refugees from city life, my wife and I were quick      to discover that we needed all the help we could get while      fixing up a small cabin and starting a garden on our few      acres in the California mountains. Our neighbors were      <em>so</em> willing to pitch in, though, that we were soon      well on our way to becoming successful homesteaders. In      fact, our only "problem" was to find some service that      <em>we</em> could perform in exchange for all the help our      new friends gave us.    </p>    <p>      The first opportunity for a "thank you" swap arrived with      our neighbors' new baby. The couple intended to have a home      birth, and we thought that they might enjoy a vacation from      their three active boys for a few days before and after the      delivery. Furthermore, the expectant parents needed a      fill-in person to answer the phone, order parts, and keep      up with the paper work at their family-run garage during      that time.    </p>    <p>      Well, the exchange turned out to be fun for everyone      involved. My wife and I had a wonderful time being foster      parents to those energetic youngsters (it gave us a chance      to feel like children again ourselves), and the few days of      relaxed, country-style office work were a snap compared to      the full-time labor we'd been accustomed to in the city.    </p>    <p>      <strong>C.B. California</strong>    </p>    <p>      Barter, in one form or another, has long been a way of life      in this part of tidewater Virginia. Many of our deals are      little more (or less!) than informal neighborly assistance      . . . and don't involve actual agreements about      reciprocation. We might, for example, give a truckload of      manure to a green-thumbed friend, and-at some time in      the future-be presented with a bushel of fresh      oysters, a tubful of herring for salting, or a few rabbits      for the stewing pot.    </p>    <p>      We do, however, have one ongoing "official"      trade-involving soft crabs and land ownership      rights-that could only occur in a tidal area. The      crustaceans, you see, need to shed their hard exoskeletons      in order to grow larger . . . and our area's ready-to-molt      shellfish move along the shoreline looking for a safe place      to "disrobe". During this search the wary crawlers      instinctively avoid all obstacles, and head into deeper      water (where they are better able to maneuver) if they      <em>do</em> encounter a barrier. Crab hunters use this      response to their advantage by running a wire fence (called      a "peeler run") perpendicular to the shoreline . . . from      the high-water mark to boating depths. A trap is then      placed at the underwater end of the fence to catch the sea      creatures. (The boxes are checked once or twice daily, and      the crabs-which by this time have begun their molting      process-are put in holding tanks until they are      completely free of the outgrown shells.)    </p>    <p>      And just how does the swap work? Well, the crabbing traps      <em>must</em> extend to the high-water mark . . . and all      of the beach above the <em>low</em> -water mark is private      property. (The distance between the tide lines is about      five feet.) So it's customary in these parts for crabbers      to give a small portion of their harvest to landowners in      exchange for permission to run fences on their property.    </p>    <p>      The results are enjoyed by both parties, too. Freshly shed      soft crabs are an expensive delicacy which we couldn't      afford to <em>buy</em> . . . and our exchange provides the      local fisherfolk with a less hassled way of earning a      livelihood.    </p>    <p>      <strong>D.G.
