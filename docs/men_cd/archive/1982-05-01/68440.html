                    <p>      <em>"Be a Clown! Be a Clawn! All the world loves a Clown!      (Cole Porter, The Pirate)</em>    </p>          <p>      <strong>Thomas Niccolls</strong><br />      My interest in clowning dates back to the late 1960's, a      grim period of protest and social unrest. At that time, I      came to believe that humor could be valuable medicine in a      world that seemed bent on following its own destructive      course. The clown character held <em>personal</em> appeal      for me, too, because I was then struggling through the      trauma of turning 40... so when "Nibs" popped out of my      psyche, his lighthearted influence was more than welcome.    </p>    <p>      As many of you likely know, clowning is an ancient and      honorable art. Furthermore, the pastime requires more than      simply donning a silly costume and greasepaint... it      involves discovering the clown that resides inside you. I      think <em>all</em> of us have one, but most folks spend      their lives keeping that "spirit" contained.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO BRING OUT THE CLOWN WITHIN</strong><br />      You can easily begin to free your own clown character,      though, if you simply list a number of adjectives or      phrases that you believe are descriptive of your      personality. Let's suppose, for example, that you write      down "shy", "loves animals", "enjoys singing", and      "jogger". That catalog denotes the "normal" you. . . and      refers to the activities you're most likely to engage in,      and the feelings you're likely to demonstrate, on a      day-to-day basis. The clown inside you includes those, of      course, but will also embrace their <em>opposites</em> .    </p>    <p>      So, take your list and write down opposing qualities. . .      "outgoing", "afraid of animals", "unmusical", "sedentary",      and so on. After all, there are times in your life when an      atypical "you" seems to pop out, right? Good clowning,      then, allows you to experience-and make good use      of-the <em>whole</em> range of thoughts and feelings      that create your personality. That's why clowns not only      laugh . . . but also weep copious tears. It's why they can      often nimbly juggle and at the same time stumble over their      own big feet. One minute a clown might strut around like      Mr. Universe and the next minute be trembling like a scared      rabbit.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, if you want to develop a <em>true</em> clown,      you'll need to spend a lot of time thinking about your      fantasies, dreams, goof-ups, and embarrassing moments.      Then, when you understand that character's personality,      pick out a moniker that expresses your clownish side.      Flower, spice, or insect names are popular choices. Are you      a "Doodlebug" perhaps? How about "Cinnamon" or "Petunia"?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ROAR OF THE GREASEPAINT . . .</strong><br />      Now that you've thought through your ideas and "conceived"      your clown, how do you give birth to him or her? Well, it's      best to start by designing the makeup for your face. Check      the Yellow Pages for theatrical supply stores, and pay a      visit to one of them. A salesperson should be able to      outfit you with everything you'll need . . . but here's a      basic shopping list for you to keep in mind: greasepaint      (either little pots of it or pencils) in clown white and      black, and also in one or more vivid colors such as red,      blue, or purple... a black grease pencil (for outlining) .      . . and white powder. Load up on plenty of cold cream,      tissues, and baby oil at the drugstore, too . . . and also      purchase a sponge and a soft brush (something similar to a      shaving brush will do the trick).    </p>    <p>      <strong>OH FUNNY FACE!</strong><br />      I've found that a makeup routine can be reduced to seven      easy steps: First, smear a <em>small</em> amount of cold      cream, using upward strokes, over your face ( <em>and</em>      neck and ears, if you're a full white-face clown) to fill      in the pores and make removing the greasepaint, when your      day's clowning is done, easier. Second, apply the clown      white. Start with a thin coating and add to it gradually.      (Most beginning clowns wear too much.) Then smooth the      white out with your fingers in firm downward strokes.    </p>    <p>      The third step is to apply the colors you've selected for      your mouth, nose, and eye area . . . and such other ac cents      as stylized round cheek spots. If you want a red rubber      nose, you can simply obtain one at a theatrical supply      store ... or you can make your own substitute by cutting a      ping-pong ball in half and painting it with latex. Hold the      homemade schnoz in place with monofilament fishing line,      which is practically invisible, and use a thin rubber band      at the back of your head to provide enough elastic to allow      you to put the nose on and take it off easily.    </p>    <p>      Step four will make your spots of color stand out: Outline      each area with the black grease pencil.    </p>    <p>      When that's done, it's time to take step five, which      separates true clowns from amateur "greaseballs". Find an      old, clean sock . . . fill it with a handful of powder . .      . shake it to get the powder sifting through . . . and      "throw" it toward your face. (A big powder puff would serve      the same purpose.) Keep this up until there's a fine, even      layer of powder on your face, which will dry up the grease.    </p>    <p>      After you're thoroughly powdered, remove any excess with      the soft brush. Use a light touch while doing so, being      careful not to smear your lines! Finally, pat a damp      sponge-lightly-over your entire face . . . to      absorb any loose powder. This should leave your face      feeling neither greasy nor dry, and all the colors will      show bright and true.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT</strong><br />      Even though you now know my basic technique, it'll take      both time and patience to develop your own face makeup.      You'd probably be best advised to keep it simple . . . and      not to make the features too large.    </p>    <p>      Most beginners, it seems, add too many symbols to their      faces (butterflies, balloons, and flowers are among the      common ones). Do experiment with them, by all means, but I      think you'll find that your clown face will be more      expressive and less "busy" if you simply emphasize your      mouth, eyes, and nose.    </p>    <p>      In doing so, you'll have to study the natural shapes and      lines of your features. If your face is round, for      instance, consider accentuating that fact by making your      eyes and mouth appear rounded, too. You might also want to      color your lower lip red and leave the upper lip white.      This will give greater flexibility to your expressions.      Learn which parts of your face move as you smile, frown,      and so forth. With color added at the appropriate points,      you can manipulate the muscles in your face to      convey-strongly-your different moods.    </p>    <p>      One last tip on makeup: Baby oil-when it's liberally      applied and wiped off with tissue-is great for      removing greasepaint. Cold cream works fine, too. Whatever      you do, though, <em>don't</em> try to wash the greasepaint      off with soap and water... or you'll have a real mess on      your hands ( <em>and</em> face!).    </p>    <p>      <strong>"I HAVEN'T A THING TO WEAR!"</strong><br />      Most closets have plenty of clown costumes lurking in them,      just waiting for the magic touch of creativity. My first      clown coat was made from the inside liner of an old      raincoat ... a nice black, fuzzy thing which I promptly      adorned with brightly colored patches, bells, and other      trimmings. Yellow tights and a fool's cap completed my      jester clown's wardrobe.    </p>    <p>      You might also try hunting around garage sales and      secondhand shops for old formal wear to create an      interesting "tramp" clown. Wigs are simple to fashion from      yarn stitched to a child's pair of stretch panties (with      the legs sewn shut).    </p>    <p>      Oversized shoes can be created by simply finding      large-sized thrift-shop tennies and fitting the "boats"      over your own. One of my friends stitched a neat pair of      clodhoppers from a castoff leather coat. (Professional      clown shoes run from $50 to $100, so it's best to try the      homemade approach before buying.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>ALL DRESSED UP AND NO PLACE TO GO?</strong><br />      A clown ought to be able to find lots of opportunities for      work. Children's birthday parties are a good source of      jobs, for instance. The clown can enter the party to      present the birthday cake . . . pass out party favors... or      even lead the children in some games. One word of caution:      Children under four are usually frightened by      strange-looking critters like clowns, so warn mothers that      <em>little</em> tots might not react favorably. It's also      wise to let the youngsters come to you, rather than to      approach them. That way you'll know they're <em>ready</em>      for your attention.    </p>    <p>      You will, of course, want to develop and maintain a      repertoire of gags or stunts. If you're musically inclined,      you might even carry an instrument, or sing. Other talents,      such as sketching and storytelling, can be worked into a      clown routine, too. And puppets can be useful props, as can      invisible trained flea acts (just <em>mime</em> them).    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE MESSAGE IN YOUR MADNESS</strong><br />      Clowning can be used to demonstrate a gentle approach to      life which underscores the simpler way of living that most      readers of this magazine strive to achieve. Think of the      possibilities, for example, of a good clown skit that      conveys the difference between a high-consumption lifestyle      and a natural, more environmentally acceptable way of doing      things.    </p>    <p>      Often, in times past, only court jesters and clowns were      <em>allowed</em> to speak out the words of wisdom their      world sorely needed to hear. In fact, back in 1917 a French      author by the name of André Suarés wrote:      "The art of the clown is more profound than we think; it is      neither tragic nor comic. It is the comic mirror of tragedy      and the tragic mirror of comedy." And the poet John Donne      penned a similar sentiment in 1633: "Who are a little wise,      the best fools be."    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Readers interested in learning more      about clowning can contact the Clowns of America Club,      Dept.
