                    <p>      <em>In the hot days to come-when energy levels will      tend to be low and appetites sluggish-you can perk up      your palate with one of these light (yet satisfying!)      single-dish meals.</em>    </p>        <p>      STAFF PHOTO    </p>    <p>      Within the next month or so, most people's garden plots      will be fairly bursting with mouthwatering vegetables . . .      and a lot of that produce will find its way to the dinner      table in large, colorful salads. However, garden-fresh      edibles-although they're often considered the classic      ingredients-aren't the only "raw materials" that can      be used to manufacture memorable salads.    </p>    <p>      You can, for example, create tasty cold dishes from cooked      grains, pasta, beans, or marinated cooked vegetables. And      these nourishing-and filling-"alternative"      salads are often quite convenient, since they can be      prepared well in advance and refrigerated until serving      time. (In fact, the following recipes <em>need</em> to be      well chilled-often for several hours-to allow      their flavors to blend and mature.)    </p>    <p>      Each of these dishes is based on nutritious, natural foods      and-when served with homemade bread-will make      an appealing, lightweight supper on those summer days when      no one feels like cooking, <em>or</em> eating, a hot meal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TABOULI</strong><br />      Among chilled grain salads, <em>tabouli</em> -which      you'll also see spelled a number of other ways-is      probably the most "exotic". This spicy dish isn't a staple      of most Westerners' diets, but it is a great Lebanese      favorite . . . and the traditional formula can easily be      varied to suit individual tastes.    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup of raw bulgur wheat<br />      3 medium-sized tomatoes, chopped<br />      1 cup of minced fresh parsley 1/3 cup of diced      scallions<br />      1/2 cup of lemon juice<br />      1/2 cup of sesame or olive oil<br />      2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh (or 2 teaspoons of      dried) mint<br />      1 teaspoon of sea salt a pinch of cayenne pepper    </p>    <p>      Combine all the ingredients and marinate them in the      refrigerator for about 6 hours. Then adjust the seasonings      to taste, and serve the tabouli on a thick bed of lettuce      leaves or sprouts. (As an alternative, you could chop up      the greens and toss them in with the salad . . . pile the      whole mixture on a platter . . . garnish it with black      olives and sprigs of parsley . . . and let four hungry      people scoop it up-Middle Eastern style-with      whole lettuce leaves.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>BALKAN RICE SALAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 medium-sized zucchini squash, cubed and steamed<br />      1 cup of thinly sliced onion<br />      1/2 cup of chopped pimentos<br />      1 large clove of garlic, pressed 1/3 cup of sesame or olive      oil<br />      3 tablespoons of vinegar<br />      2 tablespoons of soy sauce    </p>    <p>      Marinate the foregoing ingredients and chill them for at      least 4 hours. Meanwhile, you can prepare the rest of the      salad, as follows.    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons of butter<br />      1 small onion, minced<br />      1 cup of raw brown rice or millet<br />      2 cups of water (3 cups if using millet)<br />      3 tablespoons of soy sauce<br />      1 tablespoon of ketchup<br />      1 teaspoon of curry powder    </p>    <p>      Saut√© the onion in the butter before adding the      grain, water, and seasonings. Next, cover the pan and let      it simmer for about 45 minutes . . . after which you can      stir in the marinated mixture and these garnishes:    </p>    <p>      1 large green pepper, chopped<br />      1/2 cup of sliced green olives 1/2 cup of sliced black      olives<br />      2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley    </p>    <p>      Season the rice salad to taste and chill it thoroughly.      This hearty cold dish will easily feed six people when it's      arranged on a bed of greens and surrounded with sprouts and      lemon wedges. You can even stuff the leftovers into pita      bread pockets for the following day's lunch!    </p>    <p>      <strong>CUCUMBER- YOGURT SALAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      3 cucumbers<br />      1/2 cup of plain yogurt<br />      3 tablespoons of mayonnaise<br />      1 tablespoon of fresh (or 1-1/2 teaspoons of dried) dill      weed<br />      1/2 teaspoon of celery seed<br />      1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder<br />      1/4 teaspoon of sea salt a pinch of cayenne pepper sesame      seeds    </p>    <p>      Slice the cucumbers very thin . . . combine them with the      rest of the ingredients . . . and let the salad marinate in      the refrigerator until it's well chilled. Sprinkle it with      toasted sesame seeds just before serving. This tangy,      refreshing dish will perk up a dinner for four.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COLD BROCCOLI SALAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 bunch of fresh broccoli, cut in chunks (about 4 cups) and      steamed<br />      2 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />      2 heaping tablespoons of minced scallions<br />      1 cup of sliced mushrooms<br />      1 clove of garlic, pressed<br />      1 teaspoon of soy sauce<br />      1/2 cup of dry white wine<br />      3/4 cup of soy mayo, yogurt, or sour cream    </p>    <p>      Drizzle the lemon juice over the steamed broccoli and set      it aside to cool. Then, in a saucepan over medium heat,      simmer the rest of the vegetables in the wine and soy sauce      for a few minutes. Add the broccoli before stirring in the      mayonnaise . . . refrigerate the dish for about 2 hours . .      . and serve it to four to six broccoli lovers. (This salad      will be especially attractive if you decorate it with      cherry tomatoes and avocado cubes.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>MARINA TED BEAN AND VEGETABLE SALAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 cups of cooked green beans<br />      2 cups of cooked pinto or kidney beans<br />      1-1/2 cups of cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans)<br />      8 ounces of canned artichoke hearts, quartered      (optional)<br />      1 cup of fresh green peas, either raw or very lightly      steamed<br />      1 cup of diced carrots, lightly steamed<br />      1/2 cup of sliced ripe olives<br />      1/3 cup of chopped scallions<br />      1/3 cup of diced green pepper<br />      1/2 cup of chopped pimentos<br />      1/4 cup of minced fresh parsley<br />      1 tablespoon of chopped fresh (or<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons of dried) chives    </p>    <p>      Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl, then add the      following dressing:    </p>    <p>      1 cup of sesame or olive oil<br />      1/2 cup of cider vinegar<br />      2 tablespoons of honey<br />      1-2 cloves of garlic, pressed<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons of herb seasoning salt<br />      1 teaspoon of basil a pinch of cayenne pepper    </p>    <p>      Cover the bowl and let the mixture      marinate-chilled-for at least 6 hours, stirring      it occasionally. This recipe makes a lot of piquant,      filling salad ... so feel free to gather six or eight      friends to help you eat it!    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHILLED PASTA SALAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      1-1/2 cups of cooked and drained macaroni or noodles<br />      1 stalk of celery, sliced<br />      1 small carrot, grated<br />      2 tablespoons of minced parsley<br />      1 tablespoon of chopped scallions<br />      1/4 cup of diced green pepper (optional)<br />      1/4 cup of alfalfa sprouts (optional)    </p>    <p>      Mix the pasta and vegetables together, and toss them with      your favorite cream dressing... or make a distinctive sauce      from the following ingredients:    </p>    <p>      1 cup of instant (or 2/3 cup of noninstant) milk      powder<br />      1/2 cup of plain yogurt<br />      2 teaspoons of cider vinegar<br />      1/2 teaspoon of soy sauce<br />      1 teaspoon of basil<br />      1/2 teaspoon of thyme 1/4 teaspoon of oregano 1/2 teaspoon      of sea salt a pinch of cayenne pepper    </p>    <p>      Chill the salad until you're ready to eat it (at least 2      hours), then serve it, on lettuce leaf beds, to four or      five diners.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, a summer supper doesn't have to be heavy      and hot . . . nor must it necessarily be a simple bowl of      freshly harvested vegetables and greens. In fact, once      you've tried one (or more) of these nutritious one-dish      meals, everyone at your dinner table will likely agree that      a salad is the "hottest" thing going in warm-weather      cookery!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Most of these recipes are adapted from      Marilyn Bailey's</em> To Your Health ( <em>$5.70 postpaid      from Ursa Enterprises, Dept.
