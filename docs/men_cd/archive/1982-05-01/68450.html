                    <p>      <em>Try and alternative to commercial pesticides and      herbicides.</em>    </p>        <p>      STAFF PHOTO    </p>    <p>      For those of you who cringe (and rightly so!) at the      thought of applying harsh chemicals to the same soil      that'll bear your family's yearly harvest of fruits and      vegetables, yet who don't want to leave the garden plot      vulnerable to a host of wintering-over pathogens or spend      your summers fighting a thick carpel of weeds, there may be      an effective (and amazingly simple) solution to your      problem.    </p>    <p>      There's a new technique, you see, currently being      researched by farmers and gardeners throughout the      country-including MOTHER'S own Kerry and Barbara      Sullivan-that uses the sun's rays to kill bacteria,      fungi, weed seeds, nematodes, and such. The procedure,      called solarization, consists of simply soaking the ground      with water and then covering the wetted area with 1-to      6-mil clear plastic sheeting. (Naturally, you'll need to      weight down the edges to prevent the plastic from blowing      away.)    </p>    <p>      The covering produces a greenhouse effect on the soil, and      heats the ground beneath it to temperatures between      100°F and 140°F. After four to six weeks of this      solar conditioning, the soil should be cleansed of most      weed seeds and pathogens without chemical contamination.      What's more, the "pasteurized" earth is-if early      studies prove true-actually more productive than      ordinary loam.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW IT WORKS<br /></strong> There are several      perfectly logical explanations for the success claimed by      proponents of this method. For one thing, the sunlight      shining through plastic heats the topsoil enough either to      kill outright or, under less than ideal conditions, to      germinate any preexisting weed seeds (or other spores) that      might be harmful to new vegetable seedlings. Then, as the      unwanted <em>sprouted</em> seeds grow, the shoots are      destroyed by the continued high heat.    </p>    <p>      The reported increases in soil productivity could well      result from the anaerobic situation that's created by      watering the ground and covering it with airtight plastic      sheeting. Any living matter that requires oxygen, then,      will die . . . while those organisms not in need of oxygen      will thrive and-it has been suggested-speed up      the decomposition of any organic matter present in the      soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A FEW BUGS</strong><br />      Of course, there are possible disadvantages to the      solarization process, as well. One obvious drawback is      that-by temporarily heating the soil-you might      destroy as many beneficial organisms as potential problems      (although some researchers feel that the process actually      tips the scale in <em>favor</em> of beneficial organisms).      And, since the procedure does increase the      <em>sterility</em> of the treated soil, folks more inclined      toward totally wholistic gardening methods would likely      prefer to plant a cover crop as a means of discouraging      weed growth and conditioning the earth.    </p>    <p>      It's also true that within two weeks of removing the      plastic and tilling the cleansed earth, many new weed seeds      and bacteria spores will likely be either blown or carried      back onto your plot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MORE TO COME</strong><br />      Soil solarization, however, does seem to have a lot of      merit. The process would probably be most beneficial to      crops like tomatoes, which are particularly susceptible to      such soil-borne diseases as verticillium wilt . . . which,      in turn, can be controlled by solarization. As an      experiment, MOTHER'S gardeners have put one plot "under      wraps" at our Eco-Village test gardens. The Sullivans      intend to plant the newly conditioned site in early May,      then compare the yields from that soil with those from an      untreated patch nearby. We'll present those results in a      future issue of MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: More information on developments at our      research gardens can be found on this article .</em>    </p>
