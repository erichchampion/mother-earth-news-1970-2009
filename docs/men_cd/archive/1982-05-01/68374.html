                    <p>      Lee Fryer began fighting our overdependence on chemical,      fossil-fuel-based fertilizers in the days before many of us      had even heard of "organic" farming. And we're pleased to      have this expert (a man who's had decades of experience      working with benign soil aids) explain how to . . .    </p>    <p>      <em>An agricultural consultant and president of Earth Foods      Associates, Mr. Fryer is the coauthor of a number of books      and-for several years-ran a large fertilizer      business that was based on converting seaweed, fish      by-products, chicken feathers, and other nutrient-laden      "waste" into farm- and garden-boosting products. We think      you'll enjoy the following excerpts from his forthcoming      book.</em> The Bio-Gardener's Bible <em>(scheduled for      publication by Chilton this fall).</em>    </p>    <p>      First, we should decide what grade, or analysis, we need in      the mixed fertilizer. For example, in the case of a      fertile, well-manured garden, only moderate      <em>nitrogen</em> should be included. <em>Phosphate</em>      should be at least double the nitrogen content, and      <em>potash</em> should be about the same as the phosphate.      Such a 1-2-2 ratio is about right for a general-purpose      organic-based garden fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      In order to leave "room" for plenty of bulk organic      ingredients, we will deliberately make this a      medium-low-analysis product. So, we'll settle on a 3-6-6      grade. This means the finished product will contain a      <em>guaranteed analysis</em> of 3% nitrogen (N), 6%      phosphate (P2O5), and 6% potash (K2O). Thus, as noted      above, the major plantfoods are provided in a 1-2-2 ratio.    </p>    <p>      To comply with these specifications, each 1,000 pounds, 100      pounds, and 10 pounds of this "model" fertilizer will      contain the following amounts of nitrogen, phosphate, and      potash.    </p>		     <p>      After looking over the available fertilizer materials in      our neighborhood, let us assume that the following      ingredients are selected for this "model" general-purpose      garden fertilizer.    </p>		      <p>      To meet the requirements of our 3-6-6 guaranteed analysis,      we may now prepare the following formula. It's calculated      to yield 1,000 pounds. However, using simple arithmetic,      the quantities can be determined for 100- and 10-pound      batches.    </p>		      <p>      NOTE: If materials are available, this fertilizer can be      improved by adding 50 pounds of seaweed meal and 30 pounds      of Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate). The quantity of compost      would be reduced to accommodate these extra ingredients.      Doing this will add seaweed's large assortments of trace      minerals, and useful magnesium from the Epsom salts.    </p>    <p>      In accordance with good fertilizer practice, we've provided      enough materials to slightly exceed the requirements of the      formula. It is noted that 3% of 1,000 pounds equals the 30      pounds of nitrogen required. Six percent (6%) of 1,000      pounds equals the 60-pound requirements for phosphate and      potash, respectively.    </p>    <p>      In this simple home mixing operation, we would round off      the superphosphate quantity to 300 pounds, the potash to      100 pounds, and the compost to 400 pounds, revising the      total to 1,020 pounds.    </p>    <p>      The quantities for smaller batches are as follows.    </p>		       <p>      <strong>ADAPTATION FOR STRICT ORGANIC      GARDENERS</strong><br />      To adapt this formula in accordance with strict organic      principles, the following revisions are suggested. However,      other combinations of organic ingredients are also      possible.    </p>		        <p>      This formulation does not fulfill the requirements of a      3-6-6 grade, in terms of <em>available</em> NPK nutrients,      since the phosphate and potash are not provided in readily      available forms. However, this is a practical organic-type      fertilizer for gardens, shrubs, berries, and fruit trees.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WEIGHING AND MIXING INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br />      When neighbors get together to blend and mix a large batch      of fertilizer, such as 1,000 pounds or more, any kind of      fairly accurate platform scales can be used. A sturdy box      can be preweighed to determine its tare, to be deducted      from gross weight. The proper amounts of the various      ingredients can then be weighed out and determined. (For      smaller batches, simply use any fairly accurate household      scale.)    </p>    <p>      I mix my fertilizers on a concrete driveway or auto parking      place, but any dry flat surface will do. Simply pour the      various materials on top of each other in a conical pile,      adding the small quantities last. Then mix everything with      a shovel by scooping material off the edges and pouring it      on top. Mix the pile thoroughly at least three times.    </p>    <p>      The finished fertilizer can be put into convenient-sized      bags or boxes. Poly liners are recommended, since some      fertilizer materials attract moisture. Store the containers      in a dry place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO SHOP FOR FERTILIZER MATERIALS . . . DON'T      GET FRUSTRATED</strong><br />      At present, in most urban communities, local garden centers      offer packaged superphosphate, bone meal, sulfate of      potash, Epsom salts, and urea. Some of them cater to      horticultural-type customers and provide FTE and chelated      minerals. Dehydrated manure and compost are also widely      available. (You can do most of your shopping by telephone,      using the Yellow Pages.)    </p>    <p>      Also, resourceful gardeners may be able to obtain bulk      material supplies by finding a fertilizer mixer/distributor      someplace in the surrounding area. Such companies are      frequently willing to sell small quantities of materials to      pleasant people who call on them. They may even have such      often hard-to-get items as FTE, Sul-po-mag, and chelated      minerals.    </p>    <p>      However, if the bulk NPK-type materials aren't available, a      practical alternative is to buy a sack (or more) of a      fairly good, already mixed garden fertilizer . . . and      fortify and "sweeten" it with biotype materials      (organic-based rose fertilizer usually contains more potash      than do other varieties). Here is a recipe for 100 pounds      of Deluxe Garden Fertilizer, using an already mixed      fertilizer as a base.    </p>		      <p>      The guaranteed analysis (grade) of this fertilizer is      approximately 4-6-6. This formula can be made strictly      organic by selecting a 100% organic mixed-fertilizer base      and eliminating the ureaform and superphosphate. Ground      rock phosphate and granite dust may be added.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: More soil-care tips can be found on this      article .</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOME BIOLOGICAL FERTILIZER      INGREDIENTS</strong><br />      <br />      <em>The information in the accompanying table will assist      you if you wish to prepare your own balanced fertilizer      mixtures containing the right amounts of major plantfoods.      Here are a few additional properties of several of the      commonly used organic-type fertilizer materials.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANIMAL AND POULTRY MANURES</strong><br />      <em>Animal manures are inherently low in actual plantfoods.      For example, dehydrated cow manure usually contains less      than one-sixth the amount of nitrogen found in sulfate of      ammonia (21% N). . . even though it smells stronger and      richer. However, we use the manure materials because they      also feed and stimulate the soil organisms that build      fertility and capture nitrogen from the atmosphere . . .      they improve the condition of the soil . . . and they      promote good air and moisture relationships.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>As some gardeners already know, poultry manure has a      higher nitrogen content than animal manure, sometimes as      high as 4% to 6% in the dehydrated product. Compared with      popular commercial fertilizers, though, even poultry manure      is a low-analysis material. It contains about one-sixth the      nitrogen of ammonium nitrate (33% N) and one-tenth the      amount in urea (46% N).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It's a sound practice to compost manure materials      before application. This increases their fertilizer      value.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMPOST</strong><br />      <em>Compost</em> is biologically processed <em>organic      matter, improved in this way for its use as fertilizer.      Even the bodies of the billions of bacteria and fungi that      perform the composting process add values to the      product.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The quality of the compost is dependent to a large      degree on its bulk constituents. A compost can be made with      manures, animal and poultry dressing wastes, feathers,      blood, fish, leaves, grass clippings, weeds, sawdust,      kitchen garbage, seaweed, sewage sludge, and any other      available biomass material.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>However, compost is enhanced when animal, poultry,      and/or fish materials are included with the vegetable      materials. This provides readily available protein-type      food for the composting organisms, thus promoting their      activity and populations in the compost pile.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>SEAWEED MEAL AND RAW SEAWEED</strong><br />      <em>Again, an important principle must be kept in mind: We      do not use seaweed as a source of NPK-type plantfoods. In      fact, seaweed contains only a smidgen of nitrogen, a speck      of phosphate, and a morsel of potash. Its signal values are      in the excellent assortments of secondary and trace      minerals it provides, such as magnesium, sulfur, iron,      zinc, iodine, molybdenum, boron, manganese, and      copper.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Also, seaweed is a good soil conditioner, serving to      loosen and improve tough, cloddy soils. In addition, it      acts as a chelating agent to help plants glean minerals for      an adequate diet.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BONE MEAL</strong><br />      <em>The bones of all animals are composed mainly of calcium      and phosphorus, in a compound called bone phosphate of      lime. When they are ground raw, portions of meat,      cartilage, and marrow are retained-adding to the      protein (nitrogen) content-and the product is called      raw bone meal. It contains from 2% to 3% nitrogen (N), 18%      to 20% phosphate (P2O5), and 28% to 30% lime (CaO). As      such, it is the finest form of phosphate fertilizer      available for use by gardeners and nursery growers.</em>    </p>    <p>      Steamed bone meal <em>is a white powder-type material. It      may contain 28% to 30% phosphate and only 1% or less of      nitrogen. It, too, is a good phosphate fertilizer but has a      lesser effect than raw meal as a biological stimulant.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>FEATHER MEAL</strong><br />      <em>As practical gardeners learned many years ago, feathers      are excellent fertilizer materials. This is because they      contain over 90% protein, thus providing 12% to 14%      nitrogen (dry basis).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Fertilizer manufacturers know how to use steam heat and      suitable reagents to process feathers into feather meal. It      contains 10% to 13% nitrogen, plus the various minerals      birds use in growing their feather clothing.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Feather meal may become available in local gardening      areas as the costs of other fertilizers rise to scandalous      levels. If so, it can be used as a nitrogen ingredient in      mixed fertilizers, or applied straight.</em>    </p>
