                    <p>      <em>"'And you really live by the river? What a jolly life!'      'By it and with it and on it and in it,' said the Rat."      (Kenneth Grahame, The Wind in the Willows)</em>    </p>    <p>      PHOTOS BY THE AUTHORS AND MOTHER'S STAFF<br />      [1] A car-top canoe carrier can be as simple as two rolled      blankets and a couple of ropes. [2] Lash all your gear to      the thwarts… so that nothing will be lost if the      boat should capsize. [3] A 1- to 3-HP motor can be clamped      to the side-near the stern-of the canoe (the      putter shown here is an electric powerplant). [4] When      boarding, the bow paddler climbs into position while the      person who’ll sit in the stern steadies the craft.      [5] Paddling requires teamwork, whether the canoe is      pivoting among lily pads or… [6] gliding on a      mirrorlike pond. [7] Because the pivot point of the craft      is its center, the stern paddler (who is located farther      from that than is the bow person) will have a greater      effect on-and more control over-the line of      travel.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Dennis and Judy Sizemore</strong><br />      Canoeists, like the Water Rat, know the joys of paddling on      a lake or river, flowing along in harmony with the earth's      natural forces and often enjoying glimpses of her untouched      beauty that the shorebound never have a chance to view.      Furthermore, waterways that are deep enough to accommodate      <em>motorized</em> boats tend to be heavily trafficked . .      . but narrow and twisting streams, broad flat swamps, and      shallow inlets where only small craft can venture remain      far more wild. And the canoe-with its quiet grace,      speed, ease of handling, light weight, versatility, and      relatively low cost-is the ideal boat for exploring      such reaches.    </p>    <p>      If you're hankering for adventure, then, or simply want to      enjoy the wonders of nature that can best be found off the      beaten trail, canoeing could be your ticket to freedom.      Learning how to handle one of the narrow, tippy vessels      will take some practice, of course, but the following      guidelines for choosing equipment and mastering the basic      paddling techniques should put you on your way to becoming      at ease on the water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHOOSING A CANOE</strong><br />      A new canoe of good quality will cost you a hefty $400 to      $2,000, while a used one will run from $100 on up. So as a      novice (see Fig. 1 so that you can talk like an expert)      you'll want to <em>rent</em> your equipment until you're      familiar with the various styles of craft <em>and</em> know      which will best meet your specific needs. Check with      camping stores or boat dealers for information on nearby      canoe liveries.    </p>    <p>      The sleek river runners come in a confusing variety of      sizes, designs, and materials . . . simply because there is      no perfect, all-purpose canoe. You'll want to choose the      style most suited to the type of paddling you'll be doing.      For example, will you be cruising on flat water or running      the rapids? Do you plan to travel as a solo paddler or with      a partner? Are you primarily interested in fishing, racing,      or canoe camping? These factors-and a good many      others-can influence your choice of equipment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS</strong><br />      In general, it's best to select the longest canoe that      suits your needs. Although they're lightweight, the shorter      craft (those from 10' to 13') tend to ride low in the      water, offer little room for gear, and are typically slower      and more unstable than are longer canoes. So even if you      intend to paddle solo, you'll want to choose a 14-footer,      at least.    </p>    <p>      Most canoeists prefer a 16' to 18' craft. The standard 17'      size travels swiftly when powered by two paddlers, has the      capacity to carry a good bit of gear, and is easy to handle      in white water. Canoes <em>over</em> 17' have an increased      capacity (meaning that they ride higher in the water than      would a shorter canoe loaded with the same weight), but in      gaining that advantage they sacrifice maneuverability.      Therefore, craft 18' or longer are used primarily for      cruising on flat water.    </p>    <p>      When selecting a canoe length, you should also be aware of      the craft's beam (the width of the boat at its widest      point) and the degree of fullness from the beam to the ends      of the craft. The more pointed and narrow a canoe, the      faster it will travel . . . however, that speed is achieved      at the expense of stability.    </p>    <p>      Another aspect of canoe design is depth. On a      wind-protected river you'll want a center depth of about      15", in order to be sure you have adequate freeboard      (that's the height of the craft's side above the      water-line) to prevent white-water waves from splashing      into your lap and swamping the canoe. On an open lake,      however, the wind will tend to catch such high sides and      blow you off course, so a shallower craft-11" to      12"-would be more appropriate.    </p>    <p>      Hull configuration will play an important role in      determining your canoe's specific function, too. There are      two basic types of hulls: flat-bottomed and rounded (see      Fig. 2). The former design has a very shallow draft (the      amount of boat that rides <em>under</em> the water), ample      cargo-carrying capacity, and stability. This type of canoe      is generally the choice of fisherfolk, since it gives an      angler room to stand up and cast, and will remain      relatively steady while he or she does so. Variations of      the flat-bottomed hull are the "shallow V" and the "shallow      arch" designs. Each of these configurations results in a      canoe that initially is somewhat tippier than is a      flat-bottomed boat, but has a greater reserve stability if      the craft should really begin to go over, and such designs      are sometimes preferred for general-purpose recreational      canoes.    </p>        <p>      The round-bottomed style feels least stable at first, but      is actually very seaworthy in rough waters. It's also the      fastest type, making it the choice of white-water racers      and long-distance paddlers.    </p>    <p>      Finally, you'll have to decide what type of keel (the      centerline that runs along the bottom of the craft), if      any, will best fit your needs. Some canoes have a "fin"      keel, others have a flat or "shoe" keel, and still others      are keelless. (An aluminum canoe, of course, always has a      keel . . . since that feature functions as the joint that      holds the two sides of the boat together.) A fin keel can      help to keep a craft on course in a strong wind by      minimizing sideways slippage, but in a swiftly flowing      shallow river, the fin has a tendency to hang up on rocks      ... so in such waters the flatter shoe keel would be a      better choice. In fact, real white-water fans frequently      prefer a keelless design (it offers no drag and allows the      canoe to slip sideways easily to avoid obstacles) with      "rockered" ends, resulting in a highly maneuverable craft.    </p>    <p>      Each of the design elements-length, beam, depth, hull      shape, and keel-will play a part in determining the      handling characteristics of your canoe. As a newcomer to      the sport, then, you'll want to try out different styles      and combinations, and finally choose a design that suits      you.    </p>        <p>      <strong>MATERIALS</strong><br />      One of the most important factors to consider when you're      in the market for a canoe is the material-wood,      aluminum, fiberglass, Kevlar, or ABS plastic-it's      made of. And, again, you should get to know the various      materials, to see how they hold up, before putting down any      cash.    </p>    <p>      Wood makes by far the most attractive canoes and-if      cared for properly-will last for decades. Wooden      craft do, however, require some upkeep, and they're heavier      than are those constructed of the more modern materials. In      addition, the high price of wooden canoes ($1,000+) puts      them beyond the budgets of most would-be owners. (Those      purse-minded purists who yearn for the beauty and sleek      performance of wood might consider buying a do-it-yourself      canoe kit, such as the one offered by Old Town-see      the access list in the accompanying sidebar-which      produces a 17' cedar strip model.)    </p>    <p>      The low price, light weight, durability, and low      maintenance needs of aluminum canoes make them practical      for both white-water and general family use. The main      drawbacks of aluminum are its lack of aesthetic appeal, its      noisiness, and its tendency to cling to rocks rather than      slip over them as plastic or fiberglass will do. On the      other hand, aluminum will slide unharmed over sand bars,      and can withstand the kind of brutal treatment that would      often damage a wooden or fiberglass boat. If you decide a      metal canoe will suit your paddling style, choose one with      close, flush rivets on the keel line and neoprene seals...      to assure watertight joints.    </p>    <p>      Fiberglass is one of the most popular canoe materials,      because of its reasonable price, attractiveness, and low      maintenance requirements. However, fiberglass craft can      range in quality from poor to excellent, so you'll want to      examine any prospective purchase closely. Avoid the      "chopper gun" models, which are made by shooting shredded      fiberglass matting into a liquid resin, resulting in a      heavy but weak hull. The hand-layup method, in which sheets      of fiberglass cloth are wetted down with a high-quality      resin and placed by hand on the canoe, is a far superior      construction technique. When buying a fiberglass canoe,      you'll get what you pay for... so be leery of "bargains",      and always look for the cloth weave on the inside of the      craft.    </p>    <p>      A newer material called Kevlar (it's a fiberglass      polyamide) is woven into sheets and hand-laid in much the      same way as is fiberglass, although the Kevlar process is      considerably more costly and sophisticated. This synthetic      is substantially lighter and sturdier than fiberglass, too,      and these qualities are reflected in a typically higher      cost.    </p>    <p>      The most recently developed canoe-body substance is ABS (it      stands for acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) plastic,      marketed under such trade names as Royalex and Oltonar. A      typical ABS "sandwich" consists of expanded buoyant plastic      foam encased in layers of ABS and covered with a tough      vinyl skin. This unusually durable material has the unique      ability to snap back into shape after a collision. Plastic      canoes are relatively maintenance-free as well as being      rugged, and-not surprisingly-frequently command      hefty prices.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PADDLE CHOICES<br /></strong> Finding a canoe, of      course, is only part of the outfitting process . . . you'll      still need something with which to propel it! Paddles are      made from almost every material used in canoe      manufacturing, and the advantages and disadvantages of each      substance are similar, as well. Wooden paddles are      generally heavier and require periodic sanding and      varnishing, while the synthetics and metal need little or      no upkeep. If you choose wood, you'll find that a laminate      is sturdier and lighter than a solid piece. If, on the      other hand, you <em>prefer</em> a paddle honed from a      single plank, be sure to select one no wider than 6-1/2",      as a broader blade will tend to split.    </p>    <p>      Like canoes, paddles come in a variety of designs, and      again your choice will depend on the type of canoeing      you'll be doing. The common "beavertail" blade, for      example, has a rounded tip... as opposed to the square      blade popular with white-water canoeists. You'll also have      to select either the long-established "pear" grip or the      newer "T" handhold.    </p>    <p>      There are two rules of thumb commonly used to determine the      length that will suit you best: You might simply choose a      paddle that-when you're in a standing      position-reaches up to your chin or a bit higher . .      . or you could, instead, buy one that just fits between      your hands when your arms are stretched out to the sides.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MASTERING THE BASICS</strong><br />      As is the case with <em>any</em> active sport, canoeing      demands a certain proficiency in several specific skills.      Before you even set foot in one of the narrow boats, it's a      good idea to practice the basic strokes . . . while, say,      kneeling on the edge of a dock. Hold the paddle by placing      the palm of the hand that's <em>opposite</em> your paddling      side on top of the grip, and-with the other      hand-grasp the shaft as close to the blade as is      comfortable. Since a paddle is most efficient when it's      vertical, or nearly so, make sure the blade will enter the      water at a point near your knee, and draw it back only as      far as your hip. Then, as you return the paddle forward for      a second stroke, "feather" it (turn its edge forward) in      the air to decrease its wind resistance.    </p>    <p>      Once you've gotten the "feel" of paddling, get a partner      and practice the different strokes in a canoe . . . keeping      close to shore at first. If possible, have an experienced      canoeist friend take the stern while you sit in the bow,      and let him or her instruct you in the various techniques      (see Fig. 3). You'll want to learn how to go forward and      back up, pivot the boat, turn in a wide "sweep" stroke,      execute emergency maneuvers, and-once you graduate to      the stern-master the "J" stroke.    </p>    <p>      Of course, just getting into and out of the boat can be an      education in itself. To board, first pull the canoe      parallel to the dock. Then stow all your gear (which should      be in watertight bags), balancing the weight fore and aft      as well as from side to side, and lash it securely to the      thwarts. Be sure-even on short outings-to take      along an extra paddle, bailers (capped milk jugs, cut off      at the bottom, and sponges will do nicely), and duct tape      (for emergency repairs). . . attach a painter (a length of      line) to the bow and coil it neatly in the boat . . . and      always wear life preservers. Finally-with all the      gear secure-the person who will sit in the bow climbs      aboard . . . and, once he or she is seated, the stern rider      eases in place.    </p>    <p>      It's best to paddle from a kneeling position (in order to      keep your center of gravity low in the boat), resting your      buttocks against the seat and using pads or cushions to      minimize the wear and tear on your knees. Some canoeists      find this position uncomfortable, however, and prefer to      paddle from a seated position . . . except when in stormy      water or rapids, where a low center of gravity would be      essential.    </p>    <p>      Practice paddling in calm waters until the maneuvers become      familiar. Also try capsizing the craft on      purpose-holding onto your paddle-and then right      the swamped canoe and propel it to shore.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UNDERWAY!</strong><br />      After you've mastered the strokes in the bow and stern and      feel confident in both flat water and moderately fast      streams, you might want to try an overnight canoe      excursion. The guidelines on gear and safety that apply in      other wilderness activities all hold true for canoe trips.      Make sure you take equipment appropriate to canoeing,      hiking, <em>and</em> camping . . . including a first aid      kit and emergency repair materials, compasses, maps,      matches, a flashlight, and insect repellent. Remember to      guard against the sun with a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved      shirt, sunglasses, and sunscreen, and to have some warm      woolen clothing along for comfort on wet and windy days. In      short, think ahead and try to prepare for all possible      situations.    </p>    <p>      Before actually making the trip, read all you can about the      waterways on which you'll be traveling. You can get      topographical maps from your state's Geological Survey or      Parks and Recreation department (look under "Government      Offices-State" in the Yellow Pages). In addition,      there are innumerable canoe-trail guidebooks put out by      canoeing organizations and outfitters (it's best to get      <em>several</em> and compare the information). You'll want      to be familiar enough with the route, <em>before</em> you      set out, to be able to anticipate each stretch and be aware      of any possible fluctuation in the river. (If at all      possible, canoe with a partner who has traveled the waters      before.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHERE OT SHOP</strong><br />      When you set out to buy your equipment, you'll find that      there are hundreds of firms to choose from. It's a good      idea to shop for name-brand canoes, as the quality of such      manufacturers' workmanship has been established over the      years. It's impossible, of course, to include even a      representative sampling of the major canoe-makers here, but      the following list will at least help you get started in      your search. (Remember, too, to check with local canoe      clubs and outfitters for bargains in <em>used</em>      equipment that they might know about.)    </p>    <p>      Alumacraft Boat Company, Dept.

Take several day-long trips to      accustom your muscles to continual paddling-and      practice canoe carries over various kinds of terrain,      <em>with</em> a pack on your back-before graduating      to overnight (or longer) excursions.
