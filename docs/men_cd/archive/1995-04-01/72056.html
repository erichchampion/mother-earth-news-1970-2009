                <p>      HERBS AND REMEDIES    </p>    		<p><strong>Two powerfully healing herbs you might have      overlooked.</strong></p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Steven Foster    </h5>		    <p>      <strong>E</strong> arly each spring, as soon as the frost      left the ground in my childhood home of Maine, dandelion      greens began to sprout, and before their early spring      blooms appeared, my grandmother would be out in the yard      harvesting the tender young greens.    </p>    <p>      "A spring cleanser," she said.    </p>    <p>      She let the greens soak in water overnight to remove the      bitterness, then boiled them like spinach. A complement of      vinegar, sprinkled over the steaming hot greens, made them      a perfect addition to dinner for a week or two each spring.      As soon as the flower buds began to form at the crown of      the root, she stopped harvesting them.    </p>    <p>      "Too bitter now," she would always say.    </p>    <p>      Dandelion is difficult to categorize. We think of it as a      weed, sometimes a vegetable, but dandelion an herb?      Certainly. What is an herb? Any plant used for culinary,      fragrant, or medicinal purposes, according to my      <em>Webster's</em> . Of course, it is so common, so      pervasive, and so familiar, our association of dandelion is      mostly that of weed. But while best known as something to      rid from a lawn, it is used for both food and medicine and,      therefore, is an herb.    </p>    <p>      Dandelion is known to botanists as <em>Taraxacum      officinale</em> , an extremely variable biennial or      perennial herb species. Over 100 different variations of      this simple herb have been described by European botanists.      Probably native to Europe, it is widespread throughout the      northern hemisphere. Wherever humans find home, so does the      dandelion. The stemless leaves arise from the crown of the      root in a rosette. The flower heads, those crowded familiar      yellow blooms, are actually a "composite" of hundreds of      tiny flowers packed together, rather than a "single      flower." It is a member of the aster or composite family.    </p>    <p>      Leaves are best harvested when they are still tender and      sweet, and are at their best during the first year of      growth. Leaves harvested after the plant buds tend to be      bitter and tough. Like her mother before her, my      grandmother was right. If you harvest dandelion leaves from      your lawn or yard, you will want them early in the spring      before the flower buds. Dandelion leaf growing is actually      a small commercial industry. As a specialty crop for fresh      leaf production, three to four million dollars worth of      leaves are grown each in Texas, Florida, Arizona,      California, and especially, New Jersey. Who would have      thought?    </p>    <p>      What can you do with dandelion in the kitchen? For the      freshly harvested leaves consider dandelion boiled greens,      dandelion spaghetti, dandelion quiche, dandelion lasagna,      dandelion bread, and dandelion pizza, to name a few. The      flowers also offer an interesting array of possibilities      from wine to jams. These are just a few of the gastronomic      possibilities to be found in, yes, you guessed it, a      cookbook devoted to the subject. Interested in more? See:      Peter Gail's <em>Dandelion Celebration</em> : A <em>Guide      to Unexpected Cuisine</em> (Goosefoot Acres Press, P.O. Box      18016, Cleveland Heights, OH 44118).    </p>    <p>      How about nutritional value? Dandelion fresh leaves contain      protein, fiber, calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium,      thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin C, and are especially high in      vitamin A. The dried leaf is high in potassium (about 4%).      According to Dr. Gail, dandelion leaves rank ahead of both      broccoli and spinach in overall nutritional value.    </p>    <p>      Both the leaves and roots of dandelion are used in herbal      medicine. Traditionally, both dandelion leaf and root have      been used for liver, gallbladder, and kidney ailments, and      as a tonic for weak or impaired digestion. They are also      considered mildly laxative. The dried root is believed to      have weaker activity than the fresh root or its      preparations. In modern European herbal medicine (called      "phytomedicine"), the leaves are used for conditions      involving water retention resulting from various causes.      Experimental data confirm that the leaf has a significant      diuretic action, and because of its high potassium content,      the leaf replaces this mineral lost through the urine.    </p>    <p>      Traditionally, the root has been used for the treatment of      rheumatism. It has been shown to possess antinflammatory      activity, perhaps providing a rational scientific basis for      its historical use in treating rheumatism. Its primary      modern use is for conditions associated with bile secretion      in the liver, as well as dyspepsia and loss of appetite.      Alcoholic extracts of the root increase bile secretion in      animal models by over 40% according to a scientific review      on dandelion produced by the European Scientific      Cooperative for Phytotherapy. They also note that the root      has experimental weight-loss activity due to its diuretic      actions and is weakly antibiotic against <em>Candida      albicans</em> .    </p>    <p>      Timing of harvest affects root quality. Summer-harvested      roots (June-August) produce a less uniform product      with lower content of biologically active bitter      principles. Late September-October harvest is      preferred. If an extract is made from the roots, the      fall-harvested roots make an opaque extract.    </p>    <p>      Spring-harvested roots (lower in inulin and other bitter      principles) produce a clear extract. In Germany, where      herbal medicine reaches its highest scientific state of      development in a Western industrialized country, dandelion      root (with herb) and dandelion leaves are allowed by the      German health authorities to be labeled for medicinal      purposes. Use is allowed as a diuretic, for treatment of      loss of appetite, dyspeptic problems, and disturbances in      bile flow. Dandelion products are contraindicated in the      treatment of obstruction of bile ducts and certain      gallbladder conditions. However, they may be used for      supportive treatment of gallstones, under a physician's      supervision. Incidentally, all medical students in modern      Germany are required to take a certain number of course      hours on herbal medicine, and a section on the subject is      now part of Germany's licensing exam for physicians.    </p>        <h3>      Stinging Nettle    </h3>    <p>      Another neglected weed that becomes a springtime herb of      choice is stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). Stinging nettle      is native to Europe, Asia, as well as North America.But the      North American material differs from the typical European      <em>Urtica dioica</em> by possessing male and female      flowers on the same plant. Here in the US., we have four      species of stinging nettles (with two subspecies and six      varieties). The typical European form has been introduced      here and is sporadically naturalized in North America.    </p>    <p>      I didn't know how to identify the plant when I first      encountered it, but soon learned the hard way. With shorts      on one Maine summer I was walking through a pasture and the      leaves, loaded with nettle. Their stinging hairs, grazed my      legs, creating tiny stings much like an ant bite. The leaf      and stem hairs are like tiny syringes. When they come into      contact with the skin, the tips break off, injecting their      chemical mix containing histamine, small amounts of formic      acid, and other chemicals into the skin. The resulting      burning sting can last for an hour or more.    </p>    <p>      Upon drying or cooking, the stinging compounds dissipate,      and freshly cooked nettles make a delicious and nutritious      spring green. The fresh plants should, of course, be      handled with gloves. Harvest the spring shoots in May or      June, before nettles begin flowering, for a tasty pot herb.      The dried herb can be sprinkled in salads, soups,      vegetables, and other foods for a subtle salt flavor and a      rich supply of iron, magnesium, potassium, calcium, vitamin      A, protein, as well as dietary fiber. In fact, nettles were      once grown as a fiber plant in Europe. They contain about      15% fiber by weight that can be processed into a soft,      flexible textile said to feel much like silk.    </p>    <p>      Herbal traditions hold that the leaves have mild diuretic      properties and are "blood building." Experimentally, the      dried leaf tea reportedly increases blood hemoglobin.      Diuretic activity has been confirmed by both laboratory      studies and a human clinical study. Nettles are also      thought to help stimulate blood circulation and have been      used as a spring tonic to clear chronic skin ailments. In      Europe, nettle leaf tea or extracts have also been used for      the treatment of skin eruptions such as eczema.    </p>    <p>      In modern German herbal medicine, an average daily dose of      about one-third ounce of the dried herb is used for      supportive treatment of rheumatic conditions, and      inflammation of the lower urinary tract. A recent      double-blind study also showed that freeze-dried nettle      extract produced positive, though limited, results in the      treatment of allergic inflammation of the nasal cavity.    </p>    <p>      The root is also the subject of modern research. An alcohol      extract from nettle roots was recently reported to lessen      the number of times that men over of the age of 60      suffering from benign prostatic enlargement (benign      prostatic hyperplasia) had to urinate during the night. The      treatment was found to be most effective in mild cases.      Therefore, the German government allows preparations of the      root for symptomatic relief of urinary difficulties      associated with prostate enlargement.    </p>    <p>      So, think twice when you see the lowly weeds. Perhaps we      should think of them as "herbs," rather than plants to be      eliminated by herbicides.    </p>
