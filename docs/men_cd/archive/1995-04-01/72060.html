                <p>      SHUSWAP DIARY    </p>               <p>      Summer rapidly approaches. I'm sitting by Shuswap Lake in      southern British Columbia and breathing in the aquamarine      air. This has long been my favorite season here, and as I      stare toward Blake Point a half-mile across Magna Bay, I      thrill at the thought of my daily swims there throughout      the last warm days of 1978. One in particular I will never      forget: The tourists have all migrated back to the city and      I have the lake to myself. It holds me in its frigid grip      as I fill my lungs with apple-ripe air and stroke toward      the far side. Blake Point is a slender sculptured arm of      sand that stretches out from a stand of crowned cottonwood,      to loosely embrace the bay. As I approach, voices ring out      to me across the surface. Drawing nearer I see no less than      100 Canada geese strutting on the farthest reach of sand.      Closer yet, I watch half of the dark-headed flock leave the      rank and begin swimming out toward me. Rhythmically they      form a V, their black eyes shining in concentration above      their white chin straps. Astonished, I find myself in the      lead, at the very apex of their design. Then a clatter of      wings and trumpets shatters the calm as they fly low over      me, nearly brushing me with wing tips in passing. Elated, I      continue to the point, then turn to swim back. Not far from      shore I am astounded to swing around and see the remaining      geese following. Once again I find myself at the apex of      the V We glide through the lake for a few moments until I      again feel them take flight around me.<br />      <br />      It was with memories such as this that I returned to      Shuswap Lake three years ago. Apart from reconnecting with      my family, I also longed to lay eyes on the lake again, and      to be immersed in its time-steeped waters. I was the fourth      generation to regularly stand hypnotized by its shimmer      against the multihued mountainside. But this was 1992, and      baffled I watched battalions of high-powered boats veer      across the bay. Every size and description of toy      imaginable was out there creating havoc with the natural      serenity. After 13 years in the wilderness I simply      couldn't grasp it.<br />      <br />      Sadly, Shuswap Lake's reputation as a party place has grown      substantially over the years. Sicamous on the most      southerly arm, has been dubbed "Houseboat Capital of the      World," and advertising for "booze and cruise" trips on the      lake have brought the yahoos in from far and wide. It is no      longer safe to swim more than 50 feet from shore. All this      past summer I watched a mother mallard with her brood of      eight navigate nervously along the bay, negotiating wide      passes around the tightening intrusion of wharves and      fences of plastic buoys. Submerged in the stench of      gasoline fumes, and buffeted about by the crazed wake of      throngs of motorized missiles, the mother mallard struggled      to stay in tune with the natural rhythms that had flowed      through her kind for aeons.<br />      <br />      Sitting in the sweltering sun this summer I watched      incredulously as a house boat decked out in a neon pink      banner pulled into the bay. In large black letters it      proclaimed SEADOO RENTALS. A clutch jet-ski boats hung like      baby leeches off of the larger vessel. The operator,      without considering the already chaotic state of the bay or      the wishes of the residents, was willing to add to the din      to make a buck. Soon beach-goers were tearing over and      paying for a whirl on a seadoo. Mounting one seems to      induce instant insanity. With the persistence of giant      mosquitoes they spun around in idiotic circles, intruding      on every level of life and rights in the land. But with      luck the marvelous happened. From the west side of the bay      a canoe made a beeline for the houseboat. In the distance      they merged. Within minutes the houseboat retreated out of      Magna Bay, its gaudy sign still screaming.<br />      <br />      Madge Noakes, who lives with her husband near Blake Point      (she grew up on the point and it was named after her      family), looks as delicate as porcelain, but she has a core      of steel. Vibrant with anger she told me about the seadoo      she had seen chasing a family of geese. In the past she had      actually witnessed a speedboat running a Canada goose to      death. One summer, with her aura of white hair and frame      that looks as though it could be knocked over with a      feather, she single-handedly took on a gang of rowdies who      refused to leave her private beach. One of the brawny beer      guzzlers had even threatened her with a fist, to which      Madge responded, "Go ahead and hit me." When they delivered      the even more articulate insult of mooning her, their lewd      gesture backfired. Madge had her camera poised and the      perfect shot put the power in her hands. After that they no      longer crossed her property line. But as Madge summed it      up, "We can write the summers off until we get controls      in." Apart from business people dependent upon the tourist      dollar, there are few members of the North Shuswap      community who meet the annual invasion with anything less      than dread. Granted, tourism is inevitable and it wins      hands down over other resource-based industries, but what      the locals want is respect for the area. Let it be known      for its natural beauty and the lively population of artists      and crafts people gracing its shore, rather than a lawless      out back where some venture only to "party till they      puke."<br />      <br />      Every morning after seeing the kids off to school, I begin      my day with a beach walk. It helps to clear the cobwebs,      and also to stretch my legs before sitting down to write.      Best of all, I never know what surprises wait for me once I      step outside the close confines of my trailer. Across the      road the Lake beckons, ever alluring no matter what the      weather.    </p>        <p>      One frigid morning I stood by an intensely steaming lake      with an amicable border collie named Cedar. I had agreed to      dogsit Cedar for awhile and he made a point of following me      most mornings. As we walked and watched the ghosts of vapor      rise from the waters, a movement in the lake brought us to      a halt on a rocky beach near the red railed wharf. Beside      the structure I could see two dark heads in the water. Then      another, and another, and I soon recognized them as animals      rather than birds. As their sleek bodies, followed by a      flow of tail, wove in and out and slowly closer to us, I      finally recognized them. In all, five otters were      frolicking in the still lake. Cedar, who was a water dog by      nature and would plunge in after a tossed stick no matter      what the season, was as baffled as I was by how close these      animals were. He plunked passively on his haunches to watch      as the otters followed a path of sunlight and swam directly      towards us, and continued on their course until they were      no more than two feet away. Their limpid eyes, it seemed to      me, were gleaming with curiosity and I could hear their      breathing clearly over Cedar's soft whining. Then, without      warning, they switched their course and headed east, and we      stared after them until they vanished from sight.    </p>    <p>      We continued our stroll another half mile to Blake point,      but every few feet our walking rhythms were interrupted by      heavy cables securing raft after raft to the shoreline. One      false step and I'd be sprawling on sand scattered with      multi-hued rocks and salmon carcasses. All the while the      child in me remembered racing along this very beach and I      suddenly resented the influx of people who had come to      claim what, in truth, can never be owned by anyone.      Prominent PRIVATE PROPERTY and KEEP OUT shouted their      commands as we continued our way past Madge and Stan's      place. Around another bend, Cedar stopped and nervously      sniffed the air. I turned and saw a bald eagle staring with      scorn from the fractured crown of a cottonwood. Cedar and I      could now chalk up two remarkable sights on this short      trip.<br />      <br />      A short distance further was the outflow of Onyx Creek,      where nearly apple green water took a meandering rocky      course to the lake, and my thoughts again swirled back to      childhood, when the creek was still called Manson. Only one      family lived close to the mouth then. What I remember most      about George and Annie William's place was how submerged it      was in the cottonwood trees and choir of creek voices.      Today, I could only describe the William's home as a shack,      but the creek cast a spell on me then. Who needed wealth      when one could live surrounded by such natural beauty.    </p>    <p>      A REMARKABLE SIGHT:    </p>    <p>      I turned and saw a bald eagle staring with scorn from the      fractured crown of a cottonwood.    </p>    <p>      George and Annie were of Scottish descent and they called      their shaggy collie Bobby, Booby. Their daughter Irma was      crippled but when we went to visit, she always smiled as      she navigated out to the front room in her wheelchair.      Annie was tiny as a sparrow, and with her hair tied back in      a bun, she would pour rich cream from her own cow into our      tea. My sister and I had caps of shiny brown hair,      gap-toothed grins and the insatiable thirsts of six year      olds. When we were finished with several helpings, George      would inevitably insist upon hitching his horse to the      wagon and driving us home again, though it was only a      half-mile away.<br />      <br />      The William's made little impact on the land and their tiny      home no longer stands. Much of the point has now been      occupied by large, opulent houses, some of which could no      doubt sell for $300,000 or more. In many glowed small      lights left perpetually on to trick potential prowlers into      thinking someone was home. A saving grace is that the      developers preserved the property bordering the creek, but      as I stood there I could hear the progress of electric      saws, drills and the thunder of trucks hauling      landfill.<br />      <br />      Cedar and I turned and traced our path home. An electric      merganser, head submerged, darted along the shoreline,      slipping back into the water with grace and speed of an      eel. The sky was furrowed with freshly turned rain clouds      and I wondered what the future holds for Shuswap Lake. What      will become of the otters, beaver, loons and myriad forms      of life as developers continue the seemingly inexorable      course of snuffing out their habitat?<br />      <br />      I, for one, can live happily without a seadoo, all terrain      cycle, and a variety of other instant gizmoatics. What I      cannot live without is the increasingly elusive wing of      wilderness.    </p>
