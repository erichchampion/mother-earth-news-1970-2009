        <p>Attract birds to your yard and garden for year-round enjoyment by making a simple bird feeder with a plastic milk jug.</p><p>To make a homemade jug feeder, use a utility knife to cut a window out of the jug, about 2 inches up from the bottom. Poke several small holes in the bottom so rainwater can drain. Add a small stick just below the window for a perch. Some birds will feed inside the jug while others stand on the perch.<br /></p><p>In addition to putting seed in feeders, you can also drop several handfuls of seed on the ground for the ground feeders. High-quality black-oil sunflower seeds are great as basic wild-bird food. Cracked corn, millet and thistle also are favorites of our feathered friends.</p><p>To make special bird treats, gather large pinecones, dip the cones in honey and then shake them in a bag full of cracked corn and white millet. Peanut butter also works, but honey seems to appeal to the largest number of birds.</p><p>One of the benefits of creating your own seed treats is that you can avoid commercial mixes that include less attractive filler seed to bulk up the mix.</p>
