                        <h5 id="byline">      by ROBERTA HAMMER    </h5>    <p>      Winter is the homesteaders' time of trial. Even here in      Missouri-far from the Canadian wilderness and the      blizzards of the west-there are times when we feel      like shucking it. These are the days when the pipes are      frozen, the animals need water, all the dishes are dirty      and the light bulbs we're using to thaw the pump keep      breaking. If only we had a hand pump instead of instant      electric water, we wouldn't get into such a situation!      Still, there's nowhere else we'd go and nothing else we      want to do. We like it here.<br />    </p>    <p>      Winter is grim because there's not much to do outside so we      stay inside and read a LOT. And, now that the seed catalogs      have come, we PLAN a lot. We plan far more than we'll      probably ever accomplish but-after a few winters out      where nature isn't scraped away by the street      department-a family just naturally has more      confidence in themselves and what they can do with their      resources. They also have a better idea of what they CAN'T      do.    </p>    <p>      Right now we live 45 miles northeast of Kansas City. We've      lived on farms in two other locations in Missouri and we've      looked at a lot of acreage in this state. Here's some      Missouri information for folks like Jack and Judi Missett      (DEAR MOTHER, NO. 7) who want to know the advantages and      disadvantages offered by different parts of the country.    </p>    <p>      If you like seasonal weather, Missouri has a pretty nice      climate. The temperatures here can go below zero in winter      and, once in a while, will climb above 100 in the summer.      These are the extremes and are not typical; in January we      sometimes have days that register 50 or 60 degrees. We have      our last spring frost (we plan on it!) between April 15 and      May 1 and our first frost of the fall usually occurs in      early October . . . so we have an ample growing season. The      southwestern section of the state has a warmer climate but      the Ozark Plateau that angles across the southeastern      corner is comparable to the very northern part of Missouri      with, maybe, an even shorter growing season.    </p>    <p>      The place we've lived that we liked best was near Columbia,      a little north and slightly east of the center of the      state. There, we were close enough (but not too close) to      big towns to have our pick of jobs when we wanted them. The      presence of the University creates a more stimulating      intellectual climate in that region and the scenery is      beautiful. There are limestone bluffs, winding roads      through huge oak forests, dogwoods blooming in the woods      and lots of little farms with some acres cleared and some      rough and wooded.    </p>    <p>      We lived on a 148-acre farm 25 miles from Columbia. It was      remote, secluded, wooded, beautiful . . . and not ours, so      we had to leave. You can still buy wooded, unimproved land      in that area for less than $100 an acre but if you want a      good, cleared, tillable farm you'll have to really hunt to      find one with a low down payment.    </p>    <p>      Acreage gets increasingly rougher and less expensive as you      go south into the Ozark hills and big towns get scarce. We      looked at 80 acres for $7500 down that way and it was      really beautiful. The place was bordered on all sides by      the Mark Twain National Forest and had a fieldstone house,      a log barn, two springs, deer tracks and pines growing      among the oaks. BUT it required $3000 down and it was      pretty far from the only good source of jobs (a lead mine)      in the area. Besides that, hunting is allowed in the      National Forest . . . and Boy! Our goats look a lot more      like deer than some of the things deer hunters have been      known to shoot!    </p>    <p>      We were shown that place by United Farm Agency, which      publishes catalogs of farms and land for sale, and they      have many listings of such idyllic Ozark beauty spots.      You'll have to pay more to settle close to Springfield or      Joplin (and the jobs they offer) but-if you have the      time to look-I'm sure you can find some great little      homesteads in the Ozarks.    </p>    <p>      We now live in the west-northwest section of Missouri about      45 miles from Kansas City. Generally, land within 20 or 25      miles of the city (unless your signs are great) costs about      $1000 an acre and decreases in value only as you get      farther out and farther away from the super highways. The      county we are in has no large towns and no big highways. It      is considered (by the Federal Government) to be a poverty      county and taxes are fairly low.    </p>    <p>      Our 24-1/2 acres is half wooded and half cleared and cost      $460 an acre. There were some good fences but the only      buildings on the place were an old falling down house and a      shed suitable for goats. The soil is . . . well, it's      almost nonexistent. The top soil, anyway, has been allowed      to wash away and we have a lot of rebuilding to do.    </p>    <p>      One of the best things about living in the country-in      Missouri, anyway-is the people you have for      neighbors. You can always find someone to pull you out of a      mud hole or do your milking for you when you're away      overnight. We are considered a little weird but we don't      make a point of looking freaky so we get along well with      most of the folks in our community. They have a lot to      teach us.    </p>    <p>      The schools around here are no more backward than those in      Kansas City and our country schools are more pleasant in      some aspects. The local district is almost county-wide so      it's as big as many city school districts. The classrooms      our children attend out here in the sticks are modern and      bright and well equipped with modern teaching aids . . .      whatever that's worth.    </p>    <p>      Advantages and disadvantages are different things to      different people. Some folks don't like cold and snow,      others are rubbed the wrong way by the proximity of cities      and most want fertile soil although not all can afford it.    </p>    <p>      The main reason we're in Missouri is because we grew up      here and all our ties are here. Outside of a commune, we      don't know if we'd like it in the wilds and we find it kind      of scary to think about barging off into bush country      somewhere. Here, we have breathable air and we don't have      to listen to traffic 24 hours a day. The      people-farther, and farther away from the big      cities-are slower, calmer and more peaceful.    </p>    <p>      We recommend Missouri's rural areas, in other words, but we      don't recommend the towns and cities. We can't think of ANY      advantages to them!    </p>
