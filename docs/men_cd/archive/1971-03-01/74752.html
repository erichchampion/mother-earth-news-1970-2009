                    <h3>THE OWNER-BUILT HOME, BOOK ONE, CHAPTER 9</h3>    <h2 id="subtitle">      THE FIREPLACE    </h2>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        KEN KERN      </h3>      <p>        Ken Kern, author of THE OWNER-BUILT HOME and THE        OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, is an amazing fellow and everyone        interested in decentralist, back-to-the-land, rational        living should know of his work. Back in 1948 he began        collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural        construction materials and techniques. He combed the        world for ideas, tried them and started writing about his        experiments.      </p>      <p>        Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's        articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN        REVOLUTION. Ken has also issued a three year series of        pieces (called TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun        pit design of his has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.      </p>      <p>        This series of Ken Kern's work is being taken both from        OWNERBUILT HOME (already published) and OWNER-BUILT        HOMESTEAD (to be published). To give you advance chapters        of HOMESTEAD as they are written I have to break my        presentation of HOME on an irregular basis for which I        apologize. If you want HOME all at once it's available        right now direct from Ken Kern, Sierra Route, Oakhurst,        California 93644 for $10.00.      </p>      <p>        -MOTHER      </p>    </div>    <p>      No major stretch of the imagination is required to see the      status of the fireplace in relation to building site and      indoor climate. Given the proper set of climatic      circumstances, a well designed fireplace may serve as the      sole heating plant. Some experimental fireplace units      recently built in England have a reputed 80% efficiency. A      Heat Circulating type of fireplace-now becoming more      prevalent in this country-barely achieves an      efficiency of 40%, and conventional open hearth units give      off less than 25% of the heat content of the fuel consumed.      With the conventional fireplaces, half of the heat content      is lost to the atmosphere in the form of chimney gases.      Another one-fourth is conducted directly into the      surrounding masonry. An even greater loss occurs when the      fireplace is located on an outside wall.    </p>    <p>      But a fireplace can have a significance to site and climate      over and above the pure economy of indoor heating.      Symbolically the fireplace belongs more in the realm of the      building site-the landscape garden plan-than it      does to the house proper. The Chinese have a point here.      The house symbolizes the feminine (Yin) principle. As a      container, it is hollow, womb-like, commodious and warm; it      is run, managed, and cleaned by women. But the site upon      which the house is placed contains all the principles of      masculinity (Yang). The dark, passive, submissive character      of the house is contrasted to the bright and forceful      elements of the open landscape. And the most obvious      phallic symbol is of course the chimney. Man "tends" his      symbol by insisting (as he usually does) on making the      fires-even if he does nothing else in the house. Any      observant architect will witness the fact that it is more      often the husband than the wife who is concerned with the      design and eventual "looks" of the fireplace.    </p>    <p>      I have personally found that more freedom in design can be      executed and accepted in the landscape plan and in the      fireplace design than in practically any other component of      the house. Clients will approve contemporary line and form      in their gardens and fireplaces, but reject the same      principles of good design when applied to the house proper!      This fact gives me reason to expect better      results-both functionally and      "esthetically"-from the <em>fireplace</em> than from      the room in which it is to be placed.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, most of the technical improvements in      fireplace design have not yet filtered down into common      usage-and this in spite of the fact that improvements      occurred as far back in time as 1624, when Louis Savot      invented the first Heat Circulating fireplace. His unit was      installed in the Louvre, in Paris, and became the direct      prototype of Ben Franklin's 1742 "Pennsylvanian Stove." The      1624 French fireplace achieved from 30 to 45 percent more      efficiency than most American tract-home fireplaces of      today! Savot surrounded the grate with a metal air chamber      which had warm air outlets above the fire opening. He also      supplied the fire with air from under the floor. Thus room      drafts were reduced and combustion efficiency further      improved.    </p>    <p>      Few people are aware of it, but practically all of the      technical features of Franklin's Pennsylvanian Stove were      copied from earlier inventors. Savot's concept of      pre-heated draft was employed by Franklin with little      change in design. Prince Rupert's descending flue, invented      in 1678, was also applied on the early Franklin stoves. The      smoke rose in front of a hollow metal back, then passed      over the top and down the opposite side. Then, at the same      level as the hearth, the smoke ascended the flue. Ducts,      similar in design to those invented by Nicholas Gauge in      1716 were also incorporated in the Franklin stove.    </p>    <p>      A noteworthy development of the open fireplace was started      in 1796 when the Englishman, Count Rumford, published his      comprehensive essay on "Chimney Fireplaces." His main      contribution was in the alleviation of smoking chimneys.      One fault, he correctly asserted, was due to too large a      chimney-throat. Rumford also introduced the inclined      fireback, which increased fireplace efficiency by providing      a greater radiation area. For the purpose of breaking up      the current of smoke in the event of chimney down-draft,      the back smoke-shelf of Rumford's improved fireplace ended      abruptly-a practice strictly adhered to by fireplace      masons to this day.    </p>    <p>      In keeping with my original plan of how-to-think-it as well      as a how-to-do-it book, I feel that it is more important      for the owner-builder to understand the aerodynamics of      combustion and ventilation than it is for him to be      presented with the detailed dimensions of one particular      fireplace that "works." In actual practice a fireplace      involves; first, the motion of air toward the fire; second,      its passage through and over the fuel bed; third, the      admixture of ventilating currents with combustion products;      and finally the flow of chimney gases up the flue.    </p>    <p>      The first problem involves the motion of air toward the      fire-the draft. Tests carried out by the <em>Domestic      Fuels and Appliances Committee</em> in England indicate      that the required volume-flow for an average fireplace      opening is about 3000 cubic feet per hour-which      amounts to about four complete air changes in an average      size living room per hour. This same research study agency      found that the amount of fresh air required for ventilating      by a family of four is about 2400 cubic feet per hour. In      other words, a standard fireplace will cause the      displacement of over twice the amount of room air required      for optimum ventilation. Half the amount of room air should      therefore be drawn directly from the outside, and not be      permitted to pass through the room to the fireplace.      Another problem of draft is presented where fireplaces are      installed in our modern, tightly-constructed, efficiently      weather-stripped houses: The amount of air available for      supplying the chimney draft is insufficient! A partial      vacuum results, which tends to pull smoke and combustion      gases back into the room.    </p>    <p>      The problem of the foot-chilling floor draft was recognised      and solved by Savot through his application of a sub-floor      inlet for pre-heated fresh air. If applied today, his      technique would eliminate the trouble frequently      encountered in modern homes, where fireplaces operate at      low efficiency, and have a tendency to smoke because of the      lack of free-flowing air for adequate chimney draft. Cold      air currents within the room would also be minimized, for      the fireplace would derive its draft independently of      air-changes within the room. And finally, the      combustion-efficiency would increase as the incoming draft      would consist of pre-heated air. Without knowing about      Savot's work, Wendell Thomas in our day has placed an      air-inlet in the floor by the Stove as part of his      "no-draft floor" invention noted above.    </p>    <p>      The commonly accepted fireplace is without a gate; the fire      is simply bedded on the hearth. Where a grate is used and      the firebed is raised off the hearth-even a few      inches-a better rate of combustion results. The Stool      Grate, as it is known in England, consists of raised bars      upon which the firebed rests and below which air has access      through a supply line. According to experiments in England,      this Stool Grate system is 17% more efficient than the      simple hearth.    </p>    <p>      Let us consider, secondly, the passage of air through and      over the fuelbed. The grate, involving flue-control, was      common use during the Victorian era. Fireplace development      along this line naturally leads to incorporation of a      closeable open-fire. A description of such a combination      stove-fireplace has been presented by the British Building      Research Station. A 50 to 55 percent efficiency over the      enclosed fireplace is said to result from this closed      fireplace unit.    </p>        <p>      We come, thirdly, to the admixture of ventilating currents      with combustion products. Count Rumford was the first to      give extensive study to inside-fireplace proportions. His      final rule-of-thumb is that the back of the fire-space      should be equal to the depth of the recess. Deep fuel beds      produce more smoke than shallow beds, since there is scant      combustion-air at the back of the grate. Experience proves      that the rate of smoke-emission increases proportionally      with the depth of the firebox, especially in the early      stages of firing.    </p>    <p>      It is also apparent that radiation is more effective with a      shallow grate; with a deep grate some radiation is mostly      upwards. Rumford also found that a sloping fireback      contributed to increased radiation. Higher temperatures and      consequent decrease of smoke-emission results when the      fireback becomes inclined toward the fire. In order to      retain high temperature-and corresponding high      efficiency-it becomes important, of course, to      adequately insulate the fireback and walls.    </p>    <p>      Count Rumford's conclusion about the relation between the      chimney opening and effective draft has yet to be      scientifically refuted. The throat-opening should be      sufficient to constrain the effluent to pass at a speed      high enough to discourage down-drafts. Chimney-throat      standards for most fireplaces call for an eight-inch      opening; Rumford recommends four inches. If a damper is      installed within the larger sized chimney-throat, the      situation is not too bad. However, a properly designed unit      makes a damper superfluous. Simply stated, if the      chimney-throat is too large, then some cool air that does      not affect ignition or combustion will be drawn over the      fire. This naturally results in an increase of      smoke-emission. Putnan recognized the truth of this      relationship between throat-size and combustion:    </p>    <p>      "Cold air, being heavier than warm, will fall below the      latter and press it upward to make room for itself. Thus      the air in the neighborhood of the fireplace will press the      hot smoke up into the chimney-throat. If this throat is      only large enough to take the smoke, hot air only will      enter the flue, and the draught will be rapid. But if the      throat is larger than necessary, that part of the cool air      of the room which enters the fireplace and becomes most      heated by the fire, and next in buoyancy to the smoke,      will, in its turn, be pressed up by the cooler air behind      it and enter the flue alongside of the smoke. Indeed, the      entire volume of the air of the room, being warmer than the      outside air, will tend to enter the flue with the smoke, so      long as there be room provided for its entrance."    </p>    <p>      The English scientist, Dr. P. O. Rosin, has done much      significant research on the aerodynamics of open fires. He      built scale-models of fire places, using celluloid sheets      to reveal visually the behavior of the gaseous flow      associated with open fires.    </p>    <p>      Rosin was the first to prove that Rumford's horizontal      smoke-shelf on top of the fireback was aerodynamically      faulty, producing eddies of smoke-laden air that back up      into the room at the least down-draft. Rosin found also      that the chimney-breast must be located and shaped in      reference to the upper part of the fireback. A passage must      be provided which contracts toward the throat and then      diverges, as gradually as can practically be arranged, to      the cross-section area of the flue. The lower edge of the      chimney-breast should be well rounded and free from abrupt      changes of direction.    </p>    <p>      The final aspect of a fireplace, the flow of gases up the      flue, involves the chimney itself. A chimney performs a      dual function: Production of drafts; and elimination of      combustional residues. The chimney should be so designed      that the draft is adequate to deliver just enough air for      complete combustion within the firebox. The National Bureau      of Standards tests indicate that the draftproducing ability      of a chimney is substantially improved over that of      conventional chimneys when the flue is <em>reduced</em> in      cross-sectional area. Oddly enough,      <em>flue-temperature</em> is the major factor in      determining flue-size:    </p>    <p>      The formula for calculating draft is based upon mean      temperature which is the average of the temperature at the      base of the chimney and the temperature at the top. If the      chimney construction is such that an appreciable amount of      heat in the flue gases is lost through the chimney walls,      the temperature at the base will have to be higher to      produce a given mean temperature than if the chimney walls      were to be built to resist the transfer of heat through      them.    </p>    <p>      If the walls of the chimney are massive and absorb the heat      of the flue gases, a long time may be required to raise the      average flue gas temperature high enough to produce the      necessary draft. On the other hand, a long time is required      to dissipate the heat retained in the chimney walls and the      draft will continue at high intensity even though no heated      flue gases are supplied by the heating system.    </p>    <p>      "The ideal chimney has no heat loss through its walls and      consequently no difference in temperature of flue gases      between bottom and top; no heat capacity or heat-retaining      ability with consequently no time lag in producing draft      when combustion is started or in 'killing' draft when      combustion ceases."    </p>    <p>      Obviously, the fireplace should be located on an inside      wall of the house. An outside chimney, exposed to the      weather on one or more sides, is bound to cool off when the      fire is low. Then when the fire is kindled again, the      products of combustion have to force their way out of a      chimney filled with dense, cold gases. Moreover, the heat      that escapes from an inside chimney is useful because it      helps to warm up the house. Tests shore that insulation      between the flue-lining and surrounding      masonry-construction improves draft. The National Bureau of      Standards has demonstrates, that a round 7-inch flue, with      a cross-sectional area of only half that of a rectangular      9-inch by 12-inch flue, will produce the draft required,      since in square or rectangular sections have little effect      on draft. This means, of course, a substantial saving in      flue-material, surrounding masonry, and labor costs.    </p>        <p>      Oftentimes some form of draft-diverter becomes necessary to      prevent downdraft tendencies at the flue-terminal. A steady      draft is necessary to proper combustion is to be assured      over long periods of firing. One type of draft-diverter,      consisting of a permanent annular opening, is especially      effective under normal or down-draft conditions. Under all      conditions of negative pressure in the breeching, air is      admitted to it and the temperature of the mixture is always      below the temperature of the flue-gases. An even simpler      way to counter down-draft tendencies is to reduce the      flue-terminal in cross-section area. The velocity of      flue-gases is thereby increased at the flue-terminal and is      sufficient to oppose tendencies toward down-draft.    </p>    <p>      Contemporary designers have long been stymied with the      problem of integrating conventional fireplace rooms into      the modern context. It never occurs to most of them that      entirely <em>new</em> fireplace forms might be possible.      Architect Robert Woods Kennedy, for instance, tells in his      book <em>The House</em> about the unfortunate      design-qualities of the conventional fireplace: When not in      use in summer and when the ashes are removed, the fireplace      is a poor center of focus. But instead of considering the      possibilities of forming the fireplace into an interesting      sculptural composition, Kennedy suggests placing a      "planter" adjacent to the fireplace as an "alternate      focus":    </p>    <p>      "A flower window is a wonderful focus because it is      beautiful at night, if well lit. With such arrangement the      fireplace becomes an incident rather than focus."    </p>    <p>      I personally feel that a fireplace which is truly      successful in all ways-functionally as well as      "esthetically"-must necessarily contribute in all      ways and at all times to the interest and composition of      the room in which it is located. Remember that a      non-smoking hearth fire is welcome even in summer on cool      mornings or evenings. The search for an "alternate focus"      is admission of poor design. In France, and in some of the      Scandinavian countries especially, one finds more and more      original fireplaces being built.    </p>    <p>      Fireplace construction today is something of a paradox. I      refer to the growing usage of Heat Circulating forms which      increase room heat at the cost of progress in classic      fireplace design. A number of commercial units are      available (Heatform, Heat-a-labor, and Magestic are the      more popular brands). The Heat Circulating form consists of      a steel fireplace shell, surrounded by an <em>outer</em>      jacket of steel. The walls are so formed that, air is      trapped against the hot firebox walls, picking up heat and      rising through suitable grills into the living space, the      room. Cool air is draw from the same room through other      grills at the floor, and a continuous circulating stream is      thus formed. An even more effective warm air distribution      can be obtained by placing a circulating fan in a floor      duct. The fan must be powerful enough to reverse the      direction of flow, and discharge warm air on the far side      of the room.    </p>    <p>      As efficient as these commercial forms are, they      drastically restrict the original design and character of      the fireplace. Besides, they cost from $80 up. I know of      one owner-builder, however, who fabricated his own      heat-circulating form, using raw materials from a junk      yard. It perform very effectively and probably recovers      more more usable heat from the fuel consumed than the most      efficient and expensive commercial unit. Following is a      detailed description of this home-fabricated fireplace,      along with some suggested design showing a possible      exterior treatment.    </p>    <p>      The principal ingredients for this device were a discarded      water-boiler about 24-inches in diameter by 4 feet high,      plus several discarded range-boilers 12-inches in diameter,      which can be found in abundance in most junk yards. The      larger boiler must be cut down as shown, and have the upper      part closed with a 1/8-inch plate.    </p>    <p>      The firebox was then set in the corner of an adobe walied      room, Mexican style, and the 12-inch flue welded in place.      Previously a 12-inch air duct had been formed under the      floor, culminating in a distribution plenum slightly larger      in diameter than the firebox. The firebox was supported by      spaced bricks over this plenum, allowing free circulation      to the space behind the firebox walls. An outer jacket of      sheet metal was placed behind the firebox, allowing about      2-inch airspace. It was then backed by a layer of salvaged      glass wool and loose pumice fill.    </p>    <p>      Brick jambs were then carried up from the floor level,      adjacent with the vertical edges of the firebox. At lintel      height the massive wood end for further stability. The      lintel was covered on the back with asbestos and sheet      metal, and was kept about an inch away from the upper face      of the firebox, to allow air circulation. From the lintel      up, a solid fac-ewall of brick was carried, pierced only by      the warm-air outlet about 10-inches by 16-inches. About two      feet above the top of the firebox, a small concrete slab      was cast in place, resting in grooves cut in the outer      walls and in the brick face wall, and locking the 12-inch      steel flue in position. Above this slab, the triangular      space around the flue was filled with earth. Where the flue      pierced the roof, a mesh-reinforced collar of concrete      5-inches thick was carried up around it.    </p>    <p>      The circular hearth formed by the lip left at the lower      part of the original boiler was then poured full of a      fireclay-portland cement mix, and allowed to set. Wood was      placed in the firebox in a vertical position, as in typical      Mexican fireplaces. Fairly long logs could be so placed,      and though some of the burning took place in the head of      the firebox, out of sight, the heat produced was utilized      in the upper radiating surfaces and showed up in the      astonishingly warm air output, as distinguished from the      radiant heat emitted from the open part of the fire.    </p>    		<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>    <p>      (books listed in order of      importance)<br />      <em>Building Research Station Digest No. 16:</em> British      Building Research Station, Garston, Herts., U.K.<br />      <em>Performance of Masonry Chimneys For Houses:</em>      research paper No. 13, U.S. Housing and Home Agency<br />      <em>The Open Fireplace in All Ages:</em> J.

Houses in      England are usually designed for a "background heat" of 50      degrees by means of a radiant heat source. In this country,      however, an ideal heating system is more generally thought      of as one which provides a uniformly comfortable (70      degree) temperature throughout the house and throughout the      day. This, in essence, is the difference between "space      heating" and " central heating."    </p>    <p>      For technical purposes the National Bureau of Standards has      defined a "space heater" as an "above-the-floor device for      the direct heating of the space in which the device is      located without the use of external pipes or ducts as      integral parts of such heating device." In rural areas      about as many people use space heaters as their sole form      of heat as there are urban people who use central heating      installations. The low first cost of oil, wood, coal or gas      burning space heaters accounts in part for their widespread      use. The independent-type heater can be easily installed      and is efficient as well as low in fuel consumption. The      provision of a zone of warmth by radiation is another      important advantage.    </p>    <p>      But to appreciate the more basic characteristics of space      heating, one must first come to an understanding of the      Supplemental Concept of house warming. I refer to the use      both of multi-duty appliances and of combination heating      methods. In the former instance, it is possible to use a      single appliance for space heating, water heating and      cooking. In England this type of "combination grate" is      becoming more and more popular: A space heater designed      with a side oven (or a top oven), and a hinged closure hot      plate for cooking. A boiler is also integrated into the      unit to provide domestic hot water. Hot gases are directed      around the oven or around the boiler by a single damper      control. When the closure plate is up and the damper is      closed the effect is one of an open fireplace. A similar      kind of British heating appliance is designed for the fire      unit to be located in the living room and the cooking unit      in the kitchen, on the opposite side of the dividing wall.      This type of back-to-back grate makes it possible for one      appliance with one flue to serve two rooms. Since this type      is not commercially available in North America, the      owner-builder who wants it must build his own, using      commercial iron grates and brick masonry.    </p>    <p>      With the exception of the Franklin stove, the first      improvement over the simple wood and coal burning iron      stove space heater occurred in 1836, with the invention of      the air-tight radiant heater, which had a cylindrical fire      box of rolled steel between a cast iron base and top. Just      25 years ago the next major improvement was made, with the      <em>jacketed</em> space heater produced in quantity. This      type heater has a sheet of metal enclosing an air space      around the combustion chamber, with openings at top and      bottom of the enclosed space, through which a current of      air flows upward, thus producing more convected heat than      previous stoves and making it possible to heat other rooms      than the one containing the heater. The most recent      development in "console," or jacketed, space heaters      happens also to be the most significant: The fire-brick      lined, down-draft, "complete combustion," automatically      controlled heaters such as the Riteway and Ashley wood and      coal burners. These heaters are known to deliver from a      given amount of fuel fully double the amount of heat      delivered by old style heaters, and will burn for 24 hours      with one stoking. Combustion gases in the Riteway stove are      distilled from the fuel in the heating chamber, then flow      down to the charcoal level and pass upward through a      special gas-combustion flue. Here, preheated secondary air      is added to insure complete combustion of all gases. Water      heating coils, moreover, can be incorporated in the Riteway      heater.    </p>        <p>      Free-standing and portable console space heaters have been      replaced in recent years by built-in varieties such as      circulating wall heaters, PanelRay radiant heaters,      gas-steam radiators, electric resistance heaters and floor      furnaces. Except that a floor furnace can cause excessive      floor drafts, it is an improvement over most other built-in      space heaters. That is, combustion air drawn from the      outside, plus combustion products, are vented to the roof      of the building. Heat is emitted from the unit at only one      point-through registers directly above the firebox.      Cold air from the floor level, drawn into the furnace      between the firebox and its jacket, moves upward. This      furnace can supply heat to two rooms.    </p>    <p>      In his own self-designed home in the mountains of western      North Carolina, Wendell Thomas demonstrates one of the best      instances of the Supplemental Concept of heating that I      know of. The Thomases have not paid a cent for fuel. They      burn only small quantities of brush in their Riteway      heater. On the coldest winter mornings (without any stove      heat overnight) the temperature inside seldom falls below      60° F. This high minimum depends upon four factors: (1)      good insulation, including storm doors and windows, and      half-inch thick insulation boards set up inside the windows      at sundown on cold evenings; (2) the chiefly southern      exposure; (3) the cave principle-earth bank up to the      window sills on south and east, and up to the roof on the      solid north and west walls; and (4) the "no draft floor"      invention-a ventilating slot between floor and wall,      allowing air chilled by the outer wall to sink to the      cellar (or crawl space) where air is heated by earth (up to      50° in winter) and thus rises through a central      ventilator in the floor of the living space.    </p>        <p>      The ventilating slot between floor and wall not only tends      to keep the living space warm (saving greatly on fuel); it      tempers both upper and lower air, keeping the cellar dry      and the living space air normally humid; and in the cool      season it causes a constant gentle up-and-down air      circulation, even with all doors and windows closed. Since      the air movement is vertical near heater and walls, and      horizontal only along the ceiling and the <em>cellar</em>      floor, <em>there is no living space floor draft,</em> no      cold air sweeping from under the door to the heater and      chilling the feet.    </p>    <p>      Few builders are really aware of the potentialities of      using earthstored heat and cold for enhancing residential      comfort. By a process of combined conduction and      absorption, heat is stored in the earth's crust every      summer and drained from it during the winter. At a depth of      about 15 to 20 feet below the surface there is little      variation from the annual mean. Investigations on this      subject in India show that the amount of heat available      from a tunnel surface area of about 200 square yards is      about 4 million BTU. Results from the experimental      buildings designed to capture some of the ground heat      proved encouraging, when an earth-tempered air stream was      drawn up from 15 feet below grade through a suitable system      of masonry-lined ducts.    </p>    <p>      Heating engineers in 1935 developed a mechanical device to      withdraw the near-constant, inexhaustible heat from the      earth. The system is called a Heat Pump, and uses either an      air or water medium in its two-phase heating or cooling      operation. After drawing heat laden water from within the      earth into a heat exchanger refrigerant coil, the collected      heat is concentrated by a compressor and sent to an air      coil. Cool air from the house is blown through the air      coil, picking up the heat and carrying it through a central      duct system. As can be seen, the heat pump in theory is a      mechanical refrigerator in reverse. It extracts a quantity      of heat from the ground or air, then rejects the remainder      as unavailable energy. Thus the heat pump has a low overall      efficiency-ranging from 8 to 30%. Until the time when      heat pump installation costs ($2000 to $3500) are reduced,      they will not become competitive with existing central      heating and cooling methods. Even though the electricity to      operate a heat pump costs one-third as much as that of      conventional electric heaters, the operation price is still      twice that paid for less expensive fuels.    </p>    <p>      The previously described Thomas house illustrates clearly      my Supplemental concept of house warming-in combining      several heating methods to achieve inside winter comfort.      Of the three types of heating used (wood-burning space      heater, ground tempering, and solar rays), the      southoriented windows provide the Thomases with a major      share of winter heating in the daytime when the sun shines.    </p>    <p>      There are all degrees of "solar heating"-from the      simple south-oriented, double-glazed windows to a complete      collection and storage installation. Socrates was the first      known writer to state the basic principle of solar      heating-an important principle seldom employed in      contemporary house design practices:    </p>    <p>      In houses with a south aspect the sun's rays penetrate into      the porticos in winter, but in summer the path of the sun      is right over our heads and above the roofs, so that there      is shade. If, then, this is the best arrangement, we should      build the south side loftier, to get the winter sun, and      the north side lower to keep out the cold winds . . .      (Xenophon's <em>Memorablia).</em>    </p>    <p>      But the provision of large, double-glazed, south-oriented      windows with adequately designed overhang does not      necessarily constitute a "solar house." Even with a great      deal of winter sun penetrating into the house on clear or      partly cloudy days, the heat loss during completely      overcast conditions and at night may be greater than the      gain during the favorable periods. If no attempt is made to      control the excessive heat loss through the glass, such a      "solar house" may require as much as 20% more fuel than an      orthodox house during December and January (according to      <em>Heating and Ventilating Guide</em> figures).    </p>    <p>      Wendell Thomas has recognized and solved this problem      through the Supplemental Concept. He realized that, in the      cold season where he lives, the day is only 8 hours long      (or one-third of the 24 hours) and that the sun shines      about every other day. So sunlight is available only      one-sixth of the time! Accordingly, he designed a dwelling      only moderately solar, and compensated by "burying" the      house in the ground except for the south and east window      area. Even here the windows do not fill the area, and at      night (16 hours) and on cold, <em>dark</em> days, the      windows are covered inside with insulation boards and      drapes, except for two large <em>triple-paned</em> windows      which can be left uncovered in the daytime to admit      adequate light.    </p>    <p>      The Thomas solution is inexpensive and renounces the idea      of a dominantly solar house. Whether an      <em>inexpensive</em> 50 to 100% solar house can be had is a      question which research is now answering in the      affirmative.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, in order to achieve a balanced condition, some      arrangement for storing the surplus daytime heat-to      be released at night or on dark days-should be      incorporated. Let us first consider the general problems of      building a house completely heated by solar energy.    </p>    <p>      There are good arguments for using "income      energy"-the abundant and inexhaustible      sunlight-instead of "capital energy"-fossil      fuels and uranium which once used can never be replaced.      But before solar energy can be utilized for house warming,      it must first be collected and then stored. Both      <em>moving</em> and <em>fixed</em> collectors have been      used. Each type has construction and maintenance problems.      The "plane collector," which has some advantages over other      types, consists of a black metal absorber-plate covered      with insulating glass panes enclosing air spaces. Air or      water circulation is used to carry heat from the black      plate to a heat-storage bin.    </p>    <p>      Solar heat storage is perhaps the major economic liability      of the solar house. One must adopt a well designed system      of heat storage in order to maintain continuous service at      standard temperatures during sunless hours.    </p>    <p>      The specific-heat type of heat storage, using stone or hot      water, was used in the first solar-heated houses (built in      1939 at M.I.T.). Later and more efficient installations, of      the heat-of-fusion type, use a heat storage material which      melts (and stores heat) at a moderate temperature. The heat      storage capacity of some of the hydrates used for this      purpose (such as Glaubers Salt) is six or more times      greater than water and thirteen or more times greater than      rocks.    </p>    <p>      With the Supplemental Concept, however, the design for      solar collection and storage takes on a different form.      When auxiliary heat is provided, the size of the collector      plates can obviously be reduced, and the transport medium      of water or air can be integrated with the water heating      system or space heating ducts. Even the economics of solar      heating is improved when designed as a "partial" rather      than a "full" system; a house designed for between 50 and      75 percent solar heating seems to represent the optimum      degree of solar heating economically. The term      "sun-tempered" has been coined for this partial solar      heating.    </p>    <p>      One experiment in sun-tempered heating at the University of      Colorado, Boulder, Colo., with installation costs under      $500 has proven successful. A 12 by 20 foot trap was      located on the roof of the house. Air entered the trap at      the eaves, passed through a double glass panel (the bottom      layer painted black for heat absorption), and was carried      by ducts to the furnace pipe system. Temperatures were      varied by controlling the speed of the air moving through      the layers of glass.    </p>    <p>      Peter van Dresser, El Rito, N.M., has worked for years in      developing a simplified, less expensive sun-tempered      system. He prefers to locate the collector panels below the      floor level, which provides for a gravity flow hot air      circulation through ducts buried in stone directly below      the masonry floor. A correct tilt to the glass collector      (latitude plus 15 degrees) insures direct incidence of      winter's low-angle solar rays, yet reflects, or sends away,      the high-angle summer rays.    </p>    <p>      The William Johnston residence in Stratford, Ontario,      Canada, employs a simplified sun-tempered heating system.      For a slight additional expense in window and floor      materials, Mr. Johnston's heating bill came down to $97 in      an area where similar but non-solar houses use $340 in      fuel. Johnston used the concrete slab that forms his floor      to store the heat that comes in from the windows. The slab      was poured over six inches of washed gravel and one inch of      insulating board. It was insulated from the outside walls      as well as from the ground. The concrete floor slab proved      to be an excellent radiator-radiating heat directly      to persons and objects in the room. Its capacity to store      heat is remarkable. Though it does not seem warm to the      touch, it absorbs enough heat during the day to keep the      house warm throughout the night in all but the coldest      weeks of winter. It is reported that the slab trapped and      radiated enough heat one winter day when the outside      temperature was 15° <em>below zero</em> to keep the      house at 76° F.    </p>        <p>      Successful sun-tempered houses in the Southwest have been      built using black-surfaced masonry interior sun-facing      <em>walls</em> to store daytime solar energy. Surfaces      inside such a house should be low absorbers and high      emitters, such as finished plaster, which absorbs 35% of      the solar radiation and emits 93% of this in <em>long      waves.</em> The short solar waves penetrate glass readily      and warm objects within the room; the objects then radiate      in long waves which cannot get back through the glass, and      so remain to heat the house.    </p>    <p>      Glass, however, is not required for the collection of solar      heat. The National Physical Laboratory of Israel (Box 5192      , Jerusalem) has perfected a highly polished metal surface      coated with a molecular-thin black layer which absorbs more      than 90% of sunlight. Yet the polished metal radiates very      little of the heat it receives through the surface coating.      These "selective black" collector plates are now in      production in Israel. Dr. Tabor, the laboratory director,      has written, "We are at present negotiating with a large      American company to license them to use our methods, but I      cannot yet say what their policy will be towards individual      builders and architects,''    </p>    <p>      A major advance in sun-tempered space heating will take      place when owner-builders can purchase selective black      collector plates at a reasonable price. A south-facing wall      fitted out with such plated would really drink in solar      heat, windows or no window.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of      importance)    </p>    <p>      <em>World Symposium on Applied</em> <em>Solar Energy      Proceedings:</em> Association for Applied Solar Energy,      Stanford Research Institute, University of Arizona<br />      <em>Temperature in a Test Bungalow With Some Radiant and      Jacketed Space</em> <em>Heaters:</em> Paul Achenbach;      Building Materials and Structures Report BM S-114., Jan.,      1949<br />      <em>Space Heating With Solar Energy:</em> M.I.T..
