                    <h5 id="byline">      by JAMES L. CHURCHILL    </h5>            <p>      At first glance the deep snow and cold of winter might seem      to preclude any harvesting of wild foods. Not so.    </p>    <p>      Our old friend, the cattail, sleeps under the ice with      almost all the goodness of summer stored in his white roots      and tapered new shoots. It's possible on our homestead to      cut a hole in the ice of a pond, rake up enough cattail      roots for biscuits, wait for the water to clear . . . then      drop a small fish hook baited with a goldenrod grub down      the hole and whip out the fat bluegills that came to      investigate the disturbance.    </p>    <p>      I know a place in the orchard where I can dig down to a      patch of strawberries that are just as green now as ever.      Strawberry leaves make a good tea that is brimfull of      Vitamin C and I have developed a syrup from the tea that      goes good with flapjacks.    </p>    <p>      Over a hill and across the meadow a small brook tinkles and      gurgles through thick woods. As soon as the sun warms a      little in March, the patches of watercress in the brook      will branch upward from their white roots to yield several      delicious dishes.    </p>    <p>      Further north the black birch <em>(Betula Lenta)</em> and      yellow birch <em>(Betula Alleghaniensis)</em>      stand-naked but solid-against winter's fierce      blasts, ready to yield a variety of drinks for the      knowledgeable forager. Where this tree grows, very often,      the mighty Hemlock also sighs in the wind like a patient      lady waiting for spring. From the flat needles of the      evergreen comes hemlock tea (no relation to the poison      brew-made from a ground plant-that killed      Socrates), a favorite of woodsmen since logging days.    </p>    <p>      I've already given directions on gathering and using      cattails in my original FOOD WITHOUT FARMING <em>(MOTHER      NO. 3)</em> so I won't go into that again. I do want to      give you some rec ipes for the other wild foods I've just      mentioned, however, and then I want to tell you how to make      and use a Canadian Smoke Box like the ones we saw at Ranger      Lake in Ontario, <em>(MOTHER NO. 6).</em>    </p>    <p>      Strawberry tea is brewed by, first, digging the leaves from      the snow and allowing them to thaw. Then drop a double      handful into a teapot and cover them with boiling water.      Serve with a spoon of honey. That's all there is to it.    </p>    <p>      For strawberry leaf syrup make three cups of strawberry tea      and set them aside. Combine 3/4 cup of water with 6 cups of      brown sugar and mix very well. Bring this mixture to a boil      and boil hard for one minute. While it's hot pour it into      the strawberry tea. Stir for three minutes. Cover with      tight lids. This syrup, if refrigerated, will keep for      three weeks.    </p>    <p>      With that out of the way you can pull on a pair of      waterproof boots, find an old pair of scissors and gather      some watercress.    </p>    <p>      Watercress grows in clear, cold, flowing brooks all over      the United States and Southern Canada. There are two things      to remember about this plant: (1) It might be polluted if      you find it growing in a polluted stream and (2) Never pull      it up. Watercress should always be <em>cut</em> off just      above its white roots.    </p>    <p>      If you suspect that your favorite watercress brook is      contaminated, soak the "cress" in water containing      dissolved Halazone tablets. The tablets, of course, can be      purchased at almost any drugstore. Use according to      directions. And see what you can do about halting the      pollution at its source.    </p>        <p>      After you've gathered a good quantity of watercress try      some as an addition to a meat sandwich or tossed salad or      cook them as boiling greens. Boiling greens are made by      placing a double handful of cleaned watercress in a      saucepan. Cover with water, set on the fire and boil for      three minutes. Remove, drain, add a pat of butter, season      and serve.    </p>    <p>      Watercress soup is started the same way. Wash and pick over      one pound of watercress. Cook for ten minutes. Drain off      the water, add three tablespoons of butter and cook very      slowly for 15 minutes. In a separate pan melt two      tablespoons of butter and blend in two tablespoons of      flour. Keep stirring, salt lightly and cook about five      minutes or until the flour taste is gone. Add the blended      flour and butter to the watercress and heat for about one      minute. Pour into thick bowls and serve with corn bread.    </p>    <p>      Chinese watercress is probably the most vitamin-filled way      to serve this plant. Heat two tablespoons of cooking oil in      a large skillet. Sprinkle one tablespoon of grated fresh      ginger root into the hot oil and cook two minutes. Add one      pound of washed watercress. Stir and cook for four minutes.      Remove from heat, toss with a few drops of soysauce and      serve. Now you're ready to relax with a cup of birch tea.    </p>    <p>      Black birch makes the best tea. The black birch is a medium      size tree that seldom grows more than two feet in diameter      or reaches a height of 60 feet. Its leaves and twigs look      much like the white or paper birch except the bark is very      dark red to black. In summer a difference can be noted in      the leaves: Those of the black birch are hairy underneath      and slightly more oblong than those of the white birch. The      real clue to identification however is the wintergreen      flavor found in the twigs. The yellow birch <em>(Betula      Alleghaniensis)</em> has wintergreen-flavored twigs also,      but the black birch has a stronger-flavored oil that makes      a hearty tea with less effort.    </p>    <p>      Brew birch tea by cutting about a quart of twigs into      one-inch pieces. Place in a suitable pan and pour hot (but      not boiling) water over them. Let the mixture steep until      it's cool and strain the twigs and impurities from the      water with a tea strainer. Heat again and serve warm with      milk and a dash of honey.    </p>    <p>      I tried this recipe with wild honey that Joe Cummings of      Bernardston, Massachusetts sent me and it was dang good.      Joe is quite a fellow. One of the last of the professional      bee hunters. If you want some genuine wild honey write to      Joe at Hucklehill, Bernardston, Massachusetts, 01337 and      I'm sure he'll take care of you.    </p>    <p>      Here is a recipe for birch beer that I got out of an old      cookbook. I haven't tried it but it's enough like one in      Euell Gibbon's book, <em>Stalking The Wild Asparagus,</em>      to reassure me.    </p>    <p>      Place four quarts of black birch twigs cut into small      pieces in the bottom of a five gallon crock. Add eight      pounds of brown sugar to four gallons of water in a large      kettle. Stir until the sugar dissolves, heat to boiling,      boil for ten minutes and pour the bubbling mixture over the      chopped birch twigs in the crock.    </p>    <p>      Stir in one cake of yeast dissolved in a half cup of warm      water. Cover and let it work for ten days, or until the      cloudiness is gone. Bottle and cap tightly. It's ready to      serve immediately. Chill before serving. Caution: This is      an alcoholic drink and some hemlock tea might taste good      the next morning.    </p>    <p>      Hemlock tea is made by chopping hemlock needles into      inch-long pieces. Pour boiling water over the needles, let      steep for several minutes, strain out the needles and drink      warm. Makes you wonder how some of the old-timers managed      to get themselves a mild case of Scurvy every winter, when      easily available tea like this would cure them of Vitamin C      deficiency; doesn't it?    </p>    <p>      All this tea drinking has probably made you hungry so let's      reach for some good smoked fish from our Canadian Smoke      Box.    </p>            <p>      I made my 14" X 14" X 24" smoke box from scrap plywood. The      14" X 14" top and bottom each has a hole cut in it. The      bottom hole is at least seven inches in diameter and is      fitted with a six-inch stove pipe collar. The hole in the      top is about six inches across and has a cover that slides      or swivels on a screw through one corner. This sliding      cover is used to regulate the amount of smoke that passes      through the box.    </p>    <p>      The top is also hinged and will fold back to allow the      placement of meat or fish on wire mesh shelves inside the      box. Evenly spaced inside my smoker are one-inch cleats      that support 12" X 13" wire mesh shelves. These mesh      shelves are not fastened at all. They just set on the      cleats and can be lifted out for cleaning and when filling      the box. That is, the top mesh screen must be lifted out to      place the meat on the bottom shelf before the smoking is      started.    </p>    <p>      One of the main advantages of the Canadian Smoke Box is      that it can be placed over the stove pipe of a wood stove      and-when the ham or fish or whatever is      cured-the box can be removed and stored. If you build      one and wish to install it permanently it could be set on      the edge of a hill and connected with stove pipe to a fire      box below. The fire box, in that case, could be made of      stones or an old barrel and should be at least ten feet      from the smoke box so you can regulate the heat.    </p>    <p>      I use a home made barrel stove in the garage as the firebox      for my smoker. A strap iron loop on the garage roof and a      mating hook on the smoker supports the box in place. The      stove pipe from the barrel stove is threaded into the      collar on the bottom of the box, the box's top is swung      back and the wire mesh shelves are lifted out and loaded.      The sliding cover is then opened completely and a small      fire is built in the stove. I am ready to start smoking      after the meat and fish is prepared according to the      following specifications.    </p>    <p>      Smoked venison jerky is made by slicing venison into one      inch strips. Drop the strips into a boiling salt brine.      This brine should be just as strong as you can make it.      Keep stirring in salt until it won't dissolve anymore. Let      the venison strips boil about three minutes, remove, drain      and place in your smoke box. Build a small fire in the      stove and when it's blazing good smother it with a double      handful of slightly damp <em>green</em> hickory chips or      sawdust.<br />    </p>    <p>      I make my sawdust with a chain saw and every homesteader      should have one. Chain sawdust looks like thin curls of      wood and it works very well for smoking. Let this smoke      pour around your venison jerky for at least four hours,      remove, pepper the jerky and eat it.    </p>    <p>      In my opinion venison jerky is the best food in the world.      If the Great Spirit told me I could have just one more      meal, this is what I'd choose. If you don't have venison      you can make jerky from goat meat, mutton, beef or any      other meat.    </p>    <p>      Smoking with this box and barrel stove combination is a      cycle of building up the fire and smothering it with green      sawdust. When the flame starts to burn high on the dried      out sawdust smother it again. The larger the bed of coals      the more sawdust you can place on it. If you can build the      coals into a bed a foot in diameter it will handle a good      sized pail of green sawdust. Shut off the draft and it      should smolder for hours.    </p>    <p>      There are only a couple of things that can go wrong: (1)      The fire will go out because it runs out of fuel or the      draft is shut too tight or, (2) it will get too hot and      cook the cut you are trying to smoke.    </p>    <p>      If the fire goes out, of course, you will just build it up      again and go on with the curing. Never use oil of any kind      for restarting the fire as it will flavor the object being      smoked. By the same token clean out all old ashes before      starting a cure and never burn tarpaper or garbage in your      stove while a smoking project is underway.    </p>    <p>      If the meat or fish gets too hot and is cooked it will      still be edible. It might even be delicious so eat it and      start over again. Smoking meat takes a little experience      but is a very forgiving process and anyone can soon become      an expert.    </p>    <p>      Fish are smoked in the following manner: Clean and fillet      or split all fish over one pound. Wipe the pieces off with      a damp cloth and place them in a "bath" made of half salt      and half brown sugar. Make sure the mixture touches all      parts of each fillet. Leave overnight or for about twelve      hours. Next day rinse off the salt and sugar with cool      water, drain and pat dry. Place the fillets on the mesh      screens of your smoke box. Be sure they do not touch each      other or the sides of the box. Smoke at about 100° (a      thermometer is very helpful) for 24 hours, turn over and      smoke another 24 hours. Keep trying the fish and don't stop      until they are tender and smoke-colored clear through.    </p>    <p>      A faster way to smoke fish is to keep the temperature in      the box at about 150° with very heavy smoke. Twelve      hours should finish this recipe. When you get tired of fish      and venison you can smoke some ham and bacon.    </p>    <p>      Cure ham by placing it in a brine made of eight pounds of      salt, two pounds of sugar and two ounces of saltpeter. Add      4-1/2 gallons of water. Be sure to put the ham and brine in      a glass or earthen crock. Never use metal with salt brine      and don't even use a metal spoon to stir the mixture. Salt      will oxidize metal into some very lethal toxins. Place a      weight on the ham so that it remains completely covered by      the liquid and leave it for 3-1/2 to four days to the      pound. That means a ten pound ham will have to cure for      more than a month.    </p>            <p>      Watch the ham as it cures for signs of the brine turning      "sour."    </p>    <p>      This will be indicated by the presence of slime or      rope-like discolorations in the solution.    </p>    <p>      If the brine sours remove the ham, scrub and rinse it very      well. Dump the sour brine, scrub and rinse the crock. Make      a new brine with same amounts of salt, sugar and saltpeter      but add 5-1/2 gallons of water instead of 4-1/2. This,      because there will be no unsalted juices left in the meat      to dilute the solution.    </p>    <p>      When the ham is cured remove the wire shelves from your      smoke box and suspend the ham from a rod placed across the      top cleats. Smoke at about 80 to 100 degrees for at least      72 hours. Check it then and if it doesn't please your eye      and palate, smoke the meat longer.    </p>    <p>      Bacon is cured by placing in a solution made of 5-1/2      gallons of water, eight pounds of salt, two pounds of sugar      and two ounces of saltpeter. It should cure in the solution      about four days to the pound. Again, watch for the brine to      turn sour and make new brine if it does. This time,      however, you will mix the second brine in exactly the same      proportions as the first.    </p>    <p>      When the bacon is cured suspend it in your smoke box or lay      it on the wire shelves and smoke for 24 hours at less than      100°, then increase the heat and smoke it for at least      another 24 hours. As before, smoke the bacon until it      pleases your eye and palate.    </p>    <p>      The flavor of smoked meat is largely a product of the wood      used for smoking and suitable fuel can be picked up around      any wooded homestead. Hickory is very good, apple is good      and so is oak. In the north where hardwood trees are      scarce, most folks use alder. Corncobs also work well but      never-never use any resinous wood such as pine.    </p>    <p>      When you have your smoke box made and operational, try the      wood in your area on some small cuts of meat before you      commit that ham or fish to a smoking that you may not like.    </p>    <p>      Good luck. See you next issue.    </p>    <h3>      you can make a barrel stove by:    </h3>        <p>      A. Cutting 6 inches from the diameter of the barrel and      bolting quarter-inch boiler plate across the opening with      one-inch angle placed inside the barrel at the periphery of      the cut.<br />      <br />      B. Cutting a 5-inch diameter hole in the rear of the boiler      plate and welding 2 inches of 6 inch pipe to the plate for      stove pipe collar.<br />      <br />      C. Cutting the door frame out of another piece of 10 X 13      1/2 quarter-inch boiler plate. The opening in the door      frame is 8 X 10 inches. The door itself is 11-1 /2 X 8-1/2      half-inch plate steel. Hinges are 1 inch sections of      5/-8inch tubing with a 1/2-inch steel rod axis. Five inches      of quarter-inch strap iron secured with 1 inch of      1-1/2-inch angle welded to the door frame makes the latch.      The door frame is bolted over an 8 X 10 inch opening in the      barrel.<br />      <br />      D. The draft is controlled by blocking the barrel opening      at bottom of picture with pipe bushings.<br />      <br />      E. When barrel burns or rusts out remove top and door and      install them on another barrel. This makes an excellent      forge as well as a tremendous heater.    </p>
