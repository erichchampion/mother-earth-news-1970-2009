                    <h5 id="byline">      by JAMES E. CHURCHILL    </h5>        <p>      The reasons for building a homestead pond are many and      varied. I originally built mine because I wanted a      plentiful supply of good fish for food; I wanted the      convenience of catching those fish right on my own farm;      and because raising fish sounded so downright interesting.      Once our two "mini-lakes" were finished, however, I found      they contributed much more than fish to our life: many more      animals, wild ducks and other birds now come to visit and      sometimes stay on our place; the edible wild plants that      grow around the moist edges of the ponds add much "free for      the picking" variety to our diet; the little lakes form an      extremely convenient water supply for the chickens and game      birds we raise; the reservoirs give us a place to swim and      practice, canoeing in the summer and are our own private      skating rinks in the winter; the steady sources of      water-always handy for fire department use, if      necessary-cut the fire insurance premium on our      house.    </p>    <p>      There are other considerations too, such as the beauty that      the ponds add to our homestead . . . the satisfaction I get      from just sitting on a rock and watching the fish . . . or      the visiting fisherman (a ten-year-old. sage) who knows      what water spiders eat, where turtles go in the winter and      why a coonhound will never bark "treed" on Halloween night.    </p>    <p>      When I started my reservoirs I didn't have a water supply      nor a particularly good place to build a pond. I didn't      even know where to go for helpful information. Gradually,      by "feeli ng" my way along, I not only successfully      established our two ponds-one managed for trout and      the other stocked with bass and panfish-but I learned      several methods of building small lakes for very little or      absolutely no money at all. I now feel that anyone with a      half-acre or larger homestead-and armed with the      knowledge in this article-should be able to build and      maintain a successful fish pond regardless of his resources      or geography.    </p>    <h3>      SELECTING THE SITE    </h3>    <p>      I suppose the ideal location for a pond would be a      half-acre (or larger) gulley or valley with clay soil,      located on a gentle, grassy slope directly below a spring      or artesian well. All a builder would have to do, in such a      situation, is build an earth dam (with a spillway or drain      pipe to control the water's depth) across the lower end of      the depression and let it fill.    </p>    <p>      If you've got the gulley and slope but not the spring or      well, you may still be in luck. As long as you have five      acres drainage for each square foot of water that is six      feet deep in your minilake, you can build the dam and let      the rainwater runoff from the hillside fill your pond. As a      matter of fact, you can get by without the galley and      slope. Even if your homestead is flat as a pancake you can      still have that "private fishin' and swimmin' hole" . . .      by excavating.    </p>    <p>      An excavated pond is more work but it's also the most      versatile (therefore, most popular) mini-lake. Such a pond      can be located anywhere a source of water is available or      can be made available. An excavation-instead of a      dam-can even be placed in one of the gullies      mentioned earlier and, so located, would probably be easier      to keep full of water than a dug-out pond on level land.      Most valley ponds <em>are</em> at least semi-excavated, as      a matter of fact: the dam at the gulley's lower end being      constructed, generally, of clay bulldozed out and pushed      down from above.    </p>    <p>      The only minus factor (vastly overstressed in my opinion)      of an excavated pond is the difficulty involved in draining      such a reservoir dug into level ground. I believe, once      your pond is stocked, you'll find yourself much more      concerned with how to keep the water in than with how to      let it out. A pond can always be speedily drained with a      large pump that can be borrowed or rented if you don't have      one of your own.    </p>    <h3>      POND BEDS: GOOD AND BAD    </h3>    <p>      One of the poorest places to excavate a pond is in gravel      or coarse sand. Such a bed will not hold water for any      length of time and-if you're forced to establish your      private lake in such soil-you'll have to seal the bed      in some way.    </p>    <p>      Sand beds can be made watertight with strips of heavy black      plastic laid to completely cover the pond bottom and sides.      The strips should be lapped about three inches to form a      seal. Consult your local plastic dealer or county agent for      more information.    </p>    <p>      Sand ponds also can be sealed with clay if it's available.      The sides are waterproofed by digging a narrow trench one      foot deeper than the pond and three feet outside its water      area. This trench, which completely surrounds the lake, is      then tamped full of clay. The bottom is plugged by throwing      clay into the water and keeping the mini-lake as muddy as      possible by running an outboard motor or driving animals      through the pond to keep the clay in suspension. The clay      particles in the water that seeps through the bottom will      eventually form a tight, long-lasting seal.    </p>    <p>      As you might have suspected, clay makes the best bed for a      pond and-if your lake site has such subsoil (as most      do) you're home free and should have no trouble holding      water in the finished reservoir.    </p>    <h3>      THE DAM    </h3>    <p>      Although 3 few farm pond; sport concrete and other      complicated barriers, a plain old earthen dam is-by      far-the most popular "stopper" for a homestead lake.      Rule of thumb says a ratio of two parts clay to one of sand      makes the best structure; that the top of a dam should be      at least eight feet wide: and that the slope of the sides      will be three-to-one upstream and about two-to-one      downstream.    </p>    <p>      A dam is not just dirt (even clay) piled up on the bottom      of a gully. The "seam" where such fill lays on the original      soil will be a choice place for a water leak unless a      trench is dug through any top soil and down into clay to      accept the first layers of fill (which should, if possible,      be pure clay). Succeeding layers of the dam should be sand      and clay which is both well mixed in the proper proportions      and well compacted. Black top soil and/or gravel should not      be used and soil mixed with tree limbs, stumps or other      debris should also be avoided. As the dam settles and the      wood and other trash rots-as it quickly      will-holes will form in the structure and the only      hole we want in our dam is-possibly-a spillway.    </p>    <h3>      THE SPILLWAY    </h3>    <p>      A spillway is a channel over, through or around a dam      designed to carry excess water out of a pond or lake      and-thereby-hold the maximum water level in the      reservoir to a desired level. A properly designed spillway      is just as important as a properly designed dam. Indeed,      many good dams have heels washed out because a contractor      tried to save a few dollar with a "short cut" overflow      system. This is foolish because a spillway is relatively      inexpensive in the first place and quite easy to lay out      and build.    </p>    <p>      Many spillways are constructed of rocks cemented together      to form a trench through the top of a dam. Some look like      open boxes of treated wooden planks. Such a "box" spillway      has both ends missing to form an inlet and outlet for the      water and may have a vertical slide at the inlet end so      that planks-called <em>slash boards</em> -can      be dropped across the flow through the box to adjust the      pond's level. Cranberry and rice farmers, who must adjust      water levels to inches, use this slash board arrangement      and their wooden spillways last as long as ten years.    </p>    <p>      A pipe, eight inches or larger in diameter, also makes a      very satisfactory spillway and probably the most      trouble-free idea is simply to let excess water run around      the ends of the dam in a thin, slow-moving sheet. This      latter arrangement only works when a dam is higher than the      sides of the pond, of course. In some special cases      (usually when it's built of concrete or stone) the dam      itself becomes the spillway and a gravel bottom immediately      downstream catches the run-over and prevents erosion.    </p>    <h3>      GETTING IT ON    </h3>    <p>      One of the first questions you'll ask yourself, after      you've picked the site for your pond, will be, "How Am I      Going To Move All That Dirt?"    </p>    <p>      At the very bottom of the do-it-yourself methods is the      hand shovel and wheelbarrow approach. Hundreds of dams have      been built this way and hundreds more will be . . . but      it's strenuous, time consuming and the finished dam should      be a llowed to settle a year before it has to hold back      water.    </p>    <p>      One alternative to the "Armstrong" idea is an earth moving      scraper pulled behind a farm tractor. If you have or can      borrow the tractor, a second-hand scraper usually can be      obtained at a farm auction or from a machinery dealer. You      can sometimes borrow or rent one also. Horses and mules      have been used to pull these scrapers but an experienced      tractor driver can move a lot more dirt with one in a day's      time.    </p>    <p>      The mini-lake will go in much faster and easier, of course,      if you can hire(or get free) a bulldozer or earth mover to      do the job. If you do hire the construction out, however,      insist that the operator be experienced and that he follow      all the accepted rules of good pond design and      construction.    </p>    <h3>      HOW I BUILT MY FIRST POND    </h3>    <p>      Half my homestead is tillable and the other half is      forested. At the south edge of the forested half there was      a small opening in the oak and hickory trees. This clearing      was about 100 feet in diameter and appeared to be almost      constantly damp as the result of an underground water      source. I sighted across a hand level to establish a base      line for the edge of the planned pond and staked the area      out. Then I started to dig by hand.    </p>    <p>      One week and four blisters later-with a grave-sized      excavation to show for my efforts-I decided I had to      find a new way. I wanted a pond 75 feet in diameter and 7      feet deep with sides that sloped like a bowl (to minimize      cave-ins and make the mini-lake easy to seine). At the rate      I was going I would be an old man before I got the pond      dug. I certainly did want that homestead lake-and      soon!-but I knew I couldn't afford to contract the      construction out to a heavy equipment operator . . . so, by      necessity, I was <em>forced</em> to discover that there are      ways to get an excavating job done for little or no money.    </p>    <p>      I work for an equipment manufacturer who, at that time, was      developing a tractor-mounted backhoe. The backhoe was in      the working prototype stage and I learned that the engineer      in charge of the project was looking for a place to make      some unobserved tests of the machine. I quickly went to the      engineer and generously offered to allow his backhoe to dig      my pond. He was reluctant at first but I wore down his      objections by promising to grease the machine and chase      away any of my distant neighbors that showed up. Finally,      the engineer agreed.    </p>    <p>      The next morning, before I left for work, the machine      roared into my yard. I showed the operator the staked-out      lake, told him what I wanted and left. When I returned that      night, the entire pond-a big yellow bowl with      mountains of dirt piled, around the edge-was dug. I      bought fuel for the tractor and greased it. The following      day the operator came back and spread the mounds of dirt in      a gentle slope around my new lake. He was gone before I got      home. My fish pond was dug. Total cost-including a      box of cigars for the operator-was $9.45.    </p>    <p>      To keep the pond from washing I then seeded the edges down      with a mixture of grass that the local garden store      recommended. I kept the seeded earth moist for a few days      and it soon turned a beautiful green, completely healing      the fresh scars. The pond, situated near the bottom of a      gentle slope, filled rapidly with subsurface drainage and I      was ready for fish.    </p>    <p>      The excavation of my first homestead lake may seem like a      lucky one-of-a-kind deal but there are dozens of companies      which manufacture earth moving machinery and they have      thousands of employees. I'm sure that many other folks      would be able to get work done this way if they tried. And      if you don't happen to work for such a firm? Well, if you      don't work for a heavy equipment manufacturer there's at      least one other way to get a fish pond dug "for free." I      know, because I used the method to build my second pond.    </p>             <h3>      MY SECOND POND    </h3>    <p>      After I had my first pond dug I decided I needed and could      utilize a second, bigger homestead lake. The engineer's      answer was "No" this time but he told me that the heavy      equipment dealer in our area would rent machinery to anyone      who was qualified to use it. I visited the dealer and found      that his rate was fifteen dollars an hour for the machine I      needed. Not so bad . . . but I couldn't operate the      monster. All the estimates I got from contractors were way      beyond my budget so I forgot about pond number two for a      year.    </p>    <p>      Then, with the other projects around my homestead pretty      well caught up, I decided to give the second pond another      try. I had already selected the site (downslope from pond      number one) and staked it out.    </p>    <p>      This mini-lake was to be 60 feet wide and 100 feet long. It      would average about seven feet deep with the overflow      running around the banks on the original earth. The      potential pond was located in a clearing (in fact, it was      part of our 1-1/2 acre garden) and again I wondered, "How      Am I Going To Get All That Dirt Out Of There?" About then I      fell in with a cheery fellow who shared my hobby of raising      gamebirds and, suddenly, my problem was solved when my new      friend introduced me to the "demonstration" method of      getting a pond dug.    </p>    <p>      My new acquaintance, his dad and brother were in the      excavating business and the very same heavy equipment      dealer I had contacted was trying to sell the family a      front end loading earth mover. The dealer had agreed to      lend the contractors a demonstrator and operator. The      operator would spend a day or so showing the family how to      run the loader after which my friend, his brother and      father would test the machine.    </p>    <p>      Guess where the demonstration took place? That's right: my      place. More specifically, on the site of my number two      pond.    </p>    <p>      We thought, in advance, that the dealer would let my      friend's family use the loader for only a day or so and the      contractors agreed to turn the machine over to me as soon      as they had found out what they wanted to know about it.      Since I knew nothing about operating heavy equipment I      decided to learn all I could in the week we had before the      loader was delivered.    </p>    <p>      I went to the library where I found a copy of " <em>How To      Operate Heavy Equipment</em> <em>"</em> by H. L. Nichols,      Jr., printed by North Castle Books, Greenwich, Connecticut.      I read and reread this excellent manual until I had the      principles firmly in mind then I pored over another book by      the same author- <em>"Modern Techniques Of      Excavation";</em> printed by Colonial Press, Inc., Clinton,      Massachusetts-until I thought I knew exactly what I      would do when the loader arrived.    </p>    <p>      Finally the machine was here . . . and the deal turned out      even better than I had expected. The dealer's operator      stayed with the loader for two days. This almost took care      of excavating the pond right there. My friend finished the      digging in about two hours the third morning and then I      climbed on and used my "book larnin" to level the piles of      earth around the new little lake.    </p>    <p>      The second pond was done. It had cost me 25 cents for soft      drinks.    </p>    <h3>      OTHER LOW-COST EXCAVATION METHODS    </h3>    <p>      There are still other ways to get a pond constructed for      very little out-of-pocket cash. If yours is to be located      at least one-half mile from human habitation, blasting is a      very reasonable way to remove the dirt. It's not necessary      to pay for dynamite to move all that earth either, although      dynamite will be used to trigger the blast.    </p>    <p>      The main explosive element is Ammonium Nitrate saturated      with fuel oil. This is the same Ammonium Nitrate farmers      use for fertilizer and the fuel oil is the number two grade      available at any service station. A good-sized pond can be      blasted for less than ten dollars with this method. Before      you try it, however, you should obtain a copy of the      booklet, " <em>Blasting Potholes For Wildlife</em>      <em>"</em> from the Wisconsin Department of Natural      Resources, Box 450, Madison, Wisconsin 53701.    </p>    <p>      Many states have cooperative programs whereby they will      share or absorb the cost of digging a fish pond.      Information on this can be obtained from your county agent      or local conservation agent. Most of these programs are in      cooperation with the U.S. Department of the Interior.    </p>            <h3>      FILL IT FULL AND KEEP IT FULL    </h3>    <p>      After you have-by hook or crook-managed to get      your pond excavated, your next consideration will be to get      enough water to fill and keep it filled. Of course, the      spring owner or pond owner with five acres or so of      drainage for each six cubic feet of water will not have to      concern himself with a water supply.    </p>    <p>      Right here would be a good time to mention that if your      only possible homestead lake location is, say, below a bare      hillside where much silt and dirt will wash into the body      of water, you will do well to build a double pond. The      first pond will trap the dirty mixture and let the silt      settle out before the water runs into the second pond where      you'll have your fish.    </p>    <p>      If your pond is located on level ground then you may have      to use a well for a water supply. I use my house well which      will supply the house and permit me to pump 850 gallons of      water per hour to my fish ponds without affecting the      well's level. Well drillers have told me that this is a      good-but by no means exceptional-flow. Many      wells will supply this much water.    </p>    <p>      I have my fish pond pump circuit independent of the      submersible pump circuit for the house water. The entire      jet pump, jet, 100 feet of hose and a large tile for a pump      house cost me less than $150.00. I installed the "pond      pump" by first dropping a weighted line down the well      casing to find out how far down the water level was (25      feet).    </p>    <p>      I next went to a local water pump dealer and purchased a      used jet pump. Then I built a pumphouse from 40-inch tile      that I bought from a tile manufacturer.<br />    </p>    <p>      I dug down around the well casing and set the tile      vertically below the surface of the ground. Complete with a      cement floor and a block to mount the pump on, this became      a useful and easily made pumphouse. I covered the top of      this house with a wishing well that doubles as a bird      feeder in winter.    </p>    <p>      All that remained then was to purchase plastic pipe to      connect the jet to the pump. I made the pipe 32 feet long      to sink the jet five feet into the water inside the casing.      The outlet froth the pump was connected with 3/4-inch      plastic pipe to a waterfall at the first pond 100 feet      away.    </p>    <p>      It was necessary to bury the pipe about three feet in the      ground to keep the water cool while it traveled to the      pond. Burying also keeps the line out of the way and out of      sight. I drain the line in winter when there is no problem      with evaporation or the water getting too warm for my      trout.    </p>    <p>      I wired the pump through a 20 ampere fuse, primed the jet      and started it up. Altogether I have 1/5 surface acre of      ponds and the outlet from the trout pond is a 6-inch clay      tile to the bass pond. I easily keep the water in the first      fish pond below 70 degrees in summer with this pump and the      overflow maintains the water level in the second tiny lake.    </p>    <p>      Two other ways I have seen for keeping ponds full are: (1)      connecting the eave troughs from three large buildings into      a pipe that runs into the pond, (2) digging drain tile in      like spokes of a wheel that radiate out from a pond so that      the tiles catch and direct most of the local drainage into      the lake. This works very well if the pond will hold a      considerable surplus of water for the dry season.    </p>    <p>      Any pond in any location should stay full through use of      one or more of the above methods. All that remains then is      to stock it with fish.    </p>    <h3>      STOCKING THE POND    </h3>    <p>      Getting fish is simple if you have a large pond. Just      contact your county agent and he'll make arrangements for      the Department of Interior, in cooperation with your local      conservation department, to deliver fish to you. This      service is free but the fish have to be ordered before May      1st.    </p>    <p>      If-like mine-your ponds are small, then getting      fish is more complicated. In my state, you cannot legally      buy fish and stock them in a small pond without a license.      After consulting with personnel from the fisheries division      of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, however,      I learned two almost unknown but very important points of      the law.    </p>    <p>      Trout can legally be bought from a licensed hatchery and      stocked without a license and other fish can be bought from      hatcheries or caught from public waters for restocking if      you possess a class C hatchery license. A class C license      costs $5.00. Many states have no regulations against      restocking native fish so it may be possible for you to get      your brood stock by fishing public waters.    </p>    <p>      Trout, channel catfish and some other fish will not      reproduce in many ponds so it is mandatory to have a source      of supply for them. I buy my trout from Rushing Waters      Trout Farm at Palmyra, Wisconsin and my bass and bluegills      are good native Wisconsin stock.    </p>    <p>      Trout must have water that contains plenty of oxygen and is      kept below 70 degrees. The rainbow trout I've raised feed      and gain best with water temperature kept between 65 and 70      degrees. I avoid crowding the rainbows and raise only 100      at a time in my 75 foot diameter pond although I could      raise many more trout by installing a system to aerate or      churn the water. I artificially feed the trout a little but      they don't eat much: they seem able to forage most of their      food.    </p>    <p>      I have upwards of 100 adult largemouth bass in my other      pond and hundreds of bluegills. I cleaned out the bluegills      last fall and now-as I write this in August-I      have an estimated 500 "eatin' size" bluegills to catch      again this year. The bass have spawned also so I'll take      out some of the larger adults.    </p>    <p>      It's very easy to get so many fish in a pond that they all      stop growing and I feed the fish in the bass pond the same      feed that the trout get: a product called Trout Chow sold      in floating pellet form by a large farm feed company. It is      very gratifying to see the bluegills feed and grow like      they do. I suspect more pounds of meat could be raised from      bluegills than from any other fish.    </p>            <p>      F isheries personnel have a term for carefully fed and      maintained ponds. They call it "intensive management" as      opposed to minimum management where you just throw in a      certain number of fish, fertilize the water and forget      about it except for catching what you want.    </p>    <p>      I've planted cattails in one pond and wild rice in the      other. Each has done well and I regularly use both cattails      and wild rice for food. Once in awhile a muskrat will come      and forage among these plants and I'm glad to see his raft      like feed beds and to know that I've established a place to      his liking.    </p>    <p>      If the 'rat becomes a nuisance I'll just string a light      bulb out to the pond and let it burn all night. This will      bother him into leaving. Incidently this is a good way to      attract insects for fish food, too. Hang the bulb just over      the water and many insects will fall in to be devoured by      the fish that are also attracted to the light.    </p>    <p>      Now and again a mink will come for a visit and I'll see his      cat-like tracks in the mud at the water's edge . . . and      maybe the uneaten tail of a fish lying nearby. The mink is      such a wild and independent creature that just knowing they      have been by cheers me. If they become too much of a      nuisance I'll trap them during the fall when their pelts      are prime and worth the skinning.    </p>    <p>      When winter comes and locks the land the problem of water      evaporation disappears but a thick layer of ice on a small      pond can create another trouble: oxygen starvation. This      develops when the water is isolated from the air and the      oxygen-producing algae is shaded from sunlight for long      periods. The problem is especially acute if snow covers the      ice. In ponds with a high fish population and no incoming      water it will usually be necessary to use one of the      following methods to keep the fish from using up all the      oxygen in the water and dying.    </p>    <p>      The first idea I tried was churning the water with an      outboard motor about once a week. I set the motor low      enough on its stand so that it could be placed through a      hole in the ice and submerged in the water about a foot.      The action is terrific when you start up the outboard. It      will draw the water up through the hole in the ice like a      pump. I can almost completely erase the ice from my small      pond this way-in about a half hour. It works well but      I usually wind up getting wet before the session is over.    </p>    <p>      Looking around for an improvement I decided to try a small      electric-motor powered air compressor. I bought a used      compressor for $5.00, attached about 30 feet of hose, cut a      hole in the ice, dropped the hose in and started the      compressor. This works very well. It saturates the water      with oxygen while at the same time circulating the water to      open a hole in the ice. This, of course, brings the water      in contact with the atmosphere where it picks up more      oxygen. I still use this rig and have yet to lose a fish      from oxygen starvation.    </p>    <p>      A large (the largest) mailorder, retail store chain lists a      windmill in its farm catalog that will keep a hole in the      ice open all winter for livestock watering. I can see no      reason why this wouldn't keep a fish pond aerated also.    </p>    <p>      When you have your fish pond operating well, don't overlook      its money-making possibilities.    </p>    <p>      One good bet is raising bait fishes or minnows. If you      decide to try this a good publication to have is      <em>Raising Bait Fishes,</em> distributed by the Fish and      Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington,      D.C. 20240. This little booklet contains a lot of good      pond-building information also. Three-inch minnows in my      area right now are selling for $3.00 a pound (wholesale)      and, according to <em>Raising Bait Fishes,</em> 3000 pounds      of minnows can be raised per acre per year.    </p>    <p>      There's also a ready market for trout and other fish. In my      area the "pay ponds" charge so much per pound for the fish      that fishermen catch from them. These ponds appear to do      well.    </p>    <p>      One interesting sideline we have is trading fish to our      neighbors for beef or pork. The neighbors think that      they're getting the best of the bargain.    </p>    <p>      A fish pond can enrich life on your homestead in many ways.      Just remember, before you start, to write your state      conservation department for all the pertinent publications      they have. Contact your county agent for further      information and write the Department of Interior, Bureau of      Sport Fisheries and ask for their list of publications.      Read them all, then go talk to as many pond operators as      you can. Read and reread this article and, frankly, I don't      see how you can go wrong. If I can help just drop me a line      (please include a stamped envelope) in care of MOTHER.    </p>
