                        <p>      Blizzards with temperatures down to -50Â° have howled      across the steppes and plains of east Asia for untold      centuries . . . and, for many of those centuries, nomadic      herdsmen have survived such storms - snug and warm      - inside the traditional ger or yurt . Has this      modern age changed all that? No and yes: eighty-five      percent of all Mongolians still live in gers . . . but the      collapsible shelters are now prefabbed in factories.    </p>    <p>      The above sequence shows a factory-made yurt being      assembled in less than one hour without nails or bolts.      Tribesmen (UPPER LEFT) erect the expanded trellis wall and      (UPPER RIGHT) attach roof ribs to a ring held up by two      poles. The completed frame (CENTER LEFT) is ready for      (CENTER RIGHT) sheets of insulating felt. Felt was invented      in central Asia and is widely used the world over in boots      and other cold weather gear. The ger's walls (LOWER LEFT)      are covered with more sheets of felt and (LOWER RIGHT) a      final layer of canvas protects the insulation from rain and      snow. Part of the crew then secures the outer covering with      ropes while two men use a long pole to spread a separate      cover over the yurt's roof ring. Later, the ger's stovepipe      will be raised through this top covering and the fabric      itself may be turned back to admit air and light on nice      days.    </p>
