    <p>
            		        <p>      Soft blue smoke rises from a Navajo sheep camp as the sun      spreads a gold-red glow across this treeless, arroyo-cut      land of tumbleweed and sage. Shiprock-home of ancient      monsters-lies to the west. The monsters are not all      dead: Over a hill to the east, great columns of smoke      belch-seemingly-from the heart of the earth.      The sky turns black and a heavy cloud of poisoned air hangs      over the land of the Navajo.    </p>    <p>      The old ones remember when they could see the sacred      mountains of the north-snowcapped, in      Colorado-every day. They remember, too, when water      ran pure in the San Juan River and the land was free and      beautiful. Today the water is contaminated by industrial      waste and the land is scarred by transmission lines.    </p>    <p>      The southwest, where the Spanish first wrought ecological      havoc with the introduction of sheep, is again invaded.      This time, big-city utility companies-seeking fresh      and far-away fuel sources-are hastening the      destruction of land, air, water and the culture of the      people who have inhabited this area for millenniums.    </p>    <p>      The clean air and water, once the primary economic asset of      the southwestern states, is becoming a dwindling resource      thanks largely to two coal-fired power plants now in      operation. One-the Four Corners generating station      near Farmington, N.M.-spews out more particulate      matter from its stacks (320 tons daily) than all the      polluters of New York and Los Angeles combined. It's the      single largest source of pollution in the southwest and one      satellite photograph shows a plume from the plant covering      10,000 square miles. There is no excuse for this: The      operators of the station, Arizona Public Service Co.,      failed to purchase and install the pollution control      equipment required by the contract.    </p>    <p>      Particulate matter is only the visual aspect of air      pollution. Coal-fired power plants also emit oxides of      nitrogen and sulfur-invisible, but more      serious-that cause damage to plant, animal and human      life. The Mohave power plant, the second major generating      station in the southwest, burns low-grade Black Mesa coal      and is estimated to produce 65 times as much sulfur dioxide      and 86 times more nitrogen dioxide than permitted by the      Los Angeles Air Pollution Control District.    </p>    <p>      And the worst is yet to come. The Four Corners and Mohave      plants are only the first two of six major coal-fired      electrical generating stations-Four Corners, Mohave,      Page, Huntington Canyon, Kaiparowits and San      Juan-planned by Western Energy Supply and      Transmission, a 23-company utility consortium. WEST also      expects to establish many smaller power plants throughout      the region. The southwest is to be covered by a cloud of      noxious gases.    </p>    <p>      The area containing the Grand Canyon, Lake Powell, Monument      Valley, Rainbow Bridge, Bryce Canyon, Lake Mead, Mesa      Verde-the home of the traditional Indians and of      Spanish-American villagers along the Rio Grande and      Colorado Rivers-is to be expended to the demands of      city dwellers for more electricity.    </p>    <p>      The relationship of these cities to the generating stations      is similar to the relationship a "mother country" projects      upon a colony: A dependence, need and demand for raw      materials with little regard for the social, human and      environmental consequences involved. A home-owner in Los      Angeles, operating an electric toothbrush, now influences      the life of a Navajo shepherd on Black Mesa or a Hopi      religious chief in the windswept village of Oraibi.    </p>    <p>      The power plants will have a generating capacity of 36      million kilowatts by 1985 and produce three times as much      power as the Tennessee Valley Authority, 17 times more than      the Aswan Dam. Under existing air pollution standards, none      of these coal-burning plants would be allowed to operate in      the Los Angeles basin. They have been placed in the      southwest because of almost non-existant pollution laws and      the availability of fuel and cooling water.    </p>    <p>      That water is very important. Coal-fired power plants      already consume a tremendous amount of cooling      water-up to 370,000 acrefeet a year-and return      a highly saline discharge to the Colorado River watershed.      The concentration of salts and dissolved solids will be      intensified as the power-generating net is expanded and      farmers in the Imperial and Mexicali Valleys, already      suffering from saline water, will further feel the results      of the power plant complex.    </p>    <p>      A massive state development plan, the Central Arizona      Project (CAP), portrays the inter-relatedness of the      southwest crisis. CAP calls for millions of acre-feet of      water to be pumped to the expanding economies of Phoenix      and Tucson. Electricity for the project will be produced at      the Mohave and Page generating stations and water will be      taken from the already over-allocated Colorado River.    </p>    <p>      The Navajo tribe, by virtue of the treaty of 1868, holds      historic claim to all the water in the Colorado      but-through government and industrial      pressure-has been persuaded to waive these rights.      Today, the Navajos have an insufficient amount of water      (12,900 acre-feet) available for reservation use and CAP      will make it increasingly difficult for Indian tribes to      receive and utilize their full entitlement of water.    </p>    <p>      Power plants, transmission lines and cooling ponds will      scar the land . . . but far more disruptive will be the      strip mines that supply the plants' enormous appetite for      coal. Except for Mohave and Page, the generating stations      are located near abundant coal resources and the Four      Corners mine-operated by Utah Mining and      Construction-will be the largest open pit mine in the      nation by late 1971. It will produce eight and onehalf      million tons of coal annually.    </p>    <p>      The Mohave and Page plants will be fueled by coal from a      more distant source: Black Mesa, a high plateau in the      center of Navajo and Hopi lands in northeastern Arizona.      Leases were signed between Peabody Coal and the Navajo and      Hopi tribal councils "without adequate deliberation,"      according to Navajo Council member Keith Smith. "We were      asked, in effect, to say yes or no to the proposal."    </p>    <p>      Sixty four thousand acres have been leased by the mining      company. Fourteen thousand of these acres will be      stripmined, tearing up Anazazi ruins, forcing families to      move, destroying graves and grazing areas. Huge roads have      been cut across the mesa, filling washes and causing all      manner of drainage clogging and destruction. A railroad      from the foot of Black Mesa will carve a large right-of-way      through unspoiled northern Arizona to transport coal to the      generating plant at Page, 78 miles away.    </p>    <p>      The mine, roads and railroad will take much from the      natural beauty of the land and return only a few jobs of      short duration. The air and water pollution yet to be      generated by the power plants damns the project even more      and another water problem generated by the Black Mesa      scheme may turn the entire surrounding area into a near      desert. Pumping 2,770 gallons of water a day from Black      Mesa wells, to operate the 273-mile long pipeline (which      slurries a mixture of pulverized coal and water to the      plant at Mohave), could lower the local water table and      cause natural wells and springs to go dry.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the most disasterous of the human consequences      associated with the power plants will be the desecration of      Black Mesa. Black Mesa is a religious shrine-the      Female Mountain of the Navajo, the eagle-hunting grounds,      of the Hopi-and strip-mining this land is sacrilege.    </p>    <p>      Thus America is faced with losing the southwest-to      smog, water pollution, land devastation and cultural      disintegration to provide more electricity for the      overcrowded cities of a selfdestructing economic system.    </p>        <p>      There are alternative means of generating      power-nuclear, geothermal, waste plants-but to      produce more electricity to meet increased demand is not      the solution. There must occur, <em>beginning      immediately,</em> a reduction in the per-capita consumption      of power. We must learn to live without electric can      openers, toothbrushes, two TV sets. We cannot forsake our      one earth and expend its lifesupporting capacities for the      minor conveniences of superabundant power. We MUST learn to      use less electricity.    </p>
