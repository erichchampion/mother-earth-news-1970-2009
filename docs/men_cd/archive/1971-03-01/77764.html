        <h3>INNOVATOR</h3><p>The primary gratis rental for the nomad and/or remote traveler is absentee-owned land. Roads and fences to be repaired, cattle watched and timber guarded are only a few reasons that absentee land owners seek farm and ranch caretakers.</p><p>How does one find such a deal? First, try the local newspapers (not only the dailies but the weeklies and "throw aways" too) of the area in which you want to locate. Bulletin board notices (the best places for these-according to a land owner-are saddle shops and auction yards) can also be productive. When you run an ad or post a notice, state what you're looking for and what you are willing to do. There's no need to post philosophical treatise: The folks you want to reach have little time for such subjects. The next step-and usually the most successful-is going out and looking and asking.</p><p>In small towns, ask the police or storekeepers or local ranchers. Few people will get uptight if you let it be known that you're willing to work in exchange for living space. Country storekeepers are often local real estate dealers; check them. Realtors use caretakers too. Visit farms and ranches to pick up the gossip and needs of the neighborhood.</p><p>Gratis rent isn't a fantasy to dream about. It's happened to friends: One group I know was invited to live on a ranch by a land owner who digs "drop outs." An acquaintance got a house in the woods for repairs and improvements on the building. Another caretakes a house and land in exchange for rent.</p><p>Me? I turned down an offer to park my camper gratis in the mountains while cutting wood for a living. Instead I moved the rig, my family and myself to another mountain top where I live-without rent-in 77 acres of forest. I neither have to work . . . nor not work . . . traveling slowly . . . being free.</p>
