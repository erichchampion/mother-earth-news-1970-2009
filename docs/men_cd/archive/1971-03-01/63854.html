                    <p>      A modern version of the age-old yurt is popping up all over      the country like some friendly toadstool these days and a      fellow name of Bill Coperthwaite in Bucks Harbor, Maine is      responsible. The following article, by Bill himself, tells      how-somewhere between California and Sweden-his      contemporary ger came about.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      THE MODERN YURT    </h2>    <h3>      WM.S. COPERTHWAITE    </h3>    <p>      The yurt has its origins in the folk wisdom of the ancient      nomads of inner Asia. There, the prototype has withstood      the fierce cold, the violent winds and the intense heat of      the steppes for thousands of years. The traditional yurt,      made of light poles and covered with thick felt, was a      portable structure which the nomads carried with them in      their search for suitable grazing for their herds. It is      out of a profound respect for the technical genius of these      people that the name yurt was chosen for our contemporary      structure.    </p>    <p>      The nomadic yurt builders appear to be the first people to      have used the principle of the tension-band in the support      of a dwelling. This advance allowed the roof, or roof-wall,      of a structure to be raised above the ground without the      use of internal posts or trusswork. This solved a basic      architectural problem of eliminating the negative space,      space formed by the walls of most tent structures as they      meet the ground. The challenge was to have neither negative      space, posts nor trusswork blocking the interior of the      dwelling. These ancient peoples made an ingenious discovery      that, at once, gave to their tent a positive wall angle, a      clear inner space, a circular structure to fend off strong      winds while permitting less heat loss per unit of volume      than other shapes . . . and, still allowed the dwelling to      remain portable. The invention was a simple band-made of      the hair of yak, camel or goat or wool of the sheep-in the      form of several ropes sewn side by side, used to encircle      the building at the eaves and take the outward thrust of      the roof.    </p>    <p>      The world has used the tension-band principle for many      purposes, chiefly in the construction of lightweight      containers (buckets, boxes, barrels and baskets), tubs      tankards and silos and-at times-for large      masonry domes as in the Levant and ancient Rome. However,      only the Central Asian nomad appears to have applied the      principle to domestic structures.    </p>    <p>      My experiments with circular structures stem from an early      fascination with the economy of surface-to-area ratio that      they offer. This interest served no consciously practical      purpose until 1962 when I was teaching at the Meeting      School in Rindge, New Hampshire. There, a group of four      students were excited about math but had taken all of the      courses offered so we agreed to work together exploring the      geometry of roof structures. During this time I saw an      article in the National Geographic Magazine (March 1962)      with pictures of Mongolian yurts. Our immediate response,      upon seeing the skeletons of the structures, was that the      roof could be changed in a significant way to make a      new-and for some purposes, improved-roof. We      cut poles in the woods and erected the new roof.    </p>    <p>      In the spring of 1964, the first complete example of the      new yurt design was built at the John Woolman School in      Grass Valley, California. It differed from the Mongolian      yurt by having a wall that sloped outward at the top and a      roof structure that eliminated the heavy, wooden, central      ring of the traditional dwelling. This sloped wall gave      increased rigidity and strength to the structure, a back      rest in the interior and a feeling of greater spaciousness.      The dwelling was covered with translucent material allowing      the skeleton to be patterned against the sky. A madrone      tree shaded the yurt and the shadows of the leaves playing      on the roof gave it the appearance of a Japanese      painting.<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      The response of students and others who came in contact      with the structure was exciting, More than half the student      body volunteered to help build it. The pleasure shown by      those who took part made me realize that this was an      approach to learning that had great potential.    </p>    <p>      At this point the yurt was a spacious tent with a complex      skeleton of new design. It had not yet solved the problem      of providing a simple, inexpensive, permanent dwelling.      These problems, without solution, accompanied me on my      travels for about a year. Then one day while hiking in      Sweden, it occur red to me that-to make a solid      walled structure on the yurt plan-it was only      necessary to increase the width of each wall and roof      member until it overlapped its neighbor. Thus we had a      structure that united skin and skeleton. This meant that      the interior and exterior wall was erected as one      eliminating the skeleton and the perishable tent skin of      the past. By cutting the roof boards diagonally, little      waste was incurred in making tapered elements.    </p>    <p>      Upon returning from Sweden we built one of these structures      (with a sod roof, in the spring of 1966 in Plaistow, New      Hampshire. It is a pleasant dwelling and solved a number of      technical problems nicely. However, it was still not simple      enough for unskilled people to construct. The problem of      simplifying the yurt was taking a lot of time, when      suddenly, the next step came clear.    </p>    <p>      The new yurt design would be based on another geometric      concept. Instead of having an hyperbolic-paraboloid curve      in its walls, as did all other yurts up until this time,      the structure would be conic. It would appear as an immense      water bucket with its members tongue and grooved together.      The roof would be the same in principle, but a much flatter      core    </p>    <p>      The concept proved sound when we built the first conical      yurt , in College, Alaska at the home of Niilo Koponen, in      the spring of 1967. It was a delightful structure both to      build and to live in. It came closer to the ideal of      uniting skin and skeleton from straight wooden members than      any structure known to me. It proved easy to erect and      three people put up the walls and roof in seven hours.      Although I was pleased with the new structure in many ways,      I felt that cutting the tongue and groove the tapered      boards still required too much skill for the average      person.    </p>    <p>      I continued to analyse the yurt design until, one day, it      occurred red to me that there was no need to tongue and      groove the boards nor to taper the wall members. I had been      limiting my thinking to the structural terms of liquid      containers that needed to be forced together with bands to      keep them from leaking. But there was no liquid pressure in      the yurt. Its outward thrust and stability came from the      roof. The walls could be tapered boards, overlapped for      ease of nailing, and lapped more the bottom than at the top      to produce the sloping wall.    </p>    <p>      The complicated tongue and grooved, tapered boards of the      roof were eliminated by the folded roof that is to be seen      on the yurts in the photos that accompany this article. The      roof requires power equipment in its construction only for      the ripping of the boards. They are then nailed at right      angles to one another. This makes both a simpler roof      structure and an immensely stronger one as well. A      by-product of this design is the ring of triangular windows      fitted under the eaves. Although sufficient light comes in      through the central skylight, the quality of light entering      through the peripheral windows adds greatly to the      attractiveness of the structure.    </p>        <p>      The first yurt of this design was built at the home of      Randolph Brown in Westwood, Massachusetts in the fall of      1968. Shortly after this came the opportunity to build the      first Harvard yurt which was basically the same structure      with some changes in proportion. Used as a study and      seminar room in 1968-69, it received more attention than      any of the contemporary yurts up until that time, partially      due to its location on the Harvard Graduate School of      Education campus. The structure's attractiveness,      uniqueness and simplicity drew people to it. It was this      yurt that prompted the Study-Travel-Community people to      build their own school.    </p>    <h3>      SPATIAL QUALITY    </h3>    <p>      The quality of space in the yurt is quite different from      that which I have experienced in any other structure.      Viewed from the outside the yurt is unimposing. With its      low profile, sod covered roof and wall of weathered pine,      it blends easily into the natural landscape. The curved      form gives as little resistance to the eye as to the wind,      adding to the impression of its smallness . . . the yurt      seems almost a play house. From outside the possibility of      standing erect within is questionable. It is a distinct      surprise, upon entering the yurt, to find adequate head      room throughout. The illusion is intended. The structure      blends with the natural environment and is less dominating,      more human in scale . . . yet spacious within. The goal is      to promote a feeling of being at home and in harmony with      nature.    </p>    <p>      The space inside a yurt seems much larger than it is. This      is due, in part, to the structure being circular with an      outward sloping wall which tends to carry the eye with it      as it expands. In similar fashion, the roof lines expand      radially and meet the wall at a ring of light which helps      to carry the eye even further and gives a feeling of still      greater spaciousness. The central skylight spreads the      illumination evenly throughout and soft light from the      peripheral windows adds variety. All of the structural      elements described are functionally important and either      make the yurt a stronger structure, less expensive or      simpler to build. The esthetic qualities of the building      are by-products of these elements.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the yurt's most satisfying quality is the effect it      has had upon the majority of people who have visited it.      They are moved to talk not only about the beauty of the      enclosed space but also about the space as an environment      for group interac tion. Visitors, trying to formulate the      difference between this space and others they have known,      often become conscious spatial quality for the first time.      At a time when visual pollution is so great, it is of      extreme importance to develop sensitivity to environmental      quality. The yurt seems to aid in this development.    </p>    <p>      The spatial quality of the contemporary yurt is conducive      to discussion. As a seminar room, the structure has the      advantage of bringing people into a face to face      relationship easily. There is no need to arrange chairs in      a circle as in a rectangular room . . . no need to ask      people not to sit behind one another. The curved bench      echoes the wall, set at a comfortable angle for the back,      and places people within pleasant conversation distance. It      promotes group process since there is no one place more      prominent than the others.<br />    </p>    <h3>      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STRUCTURE    </h3>    <p>      Educationally this building is significant because its      design provides people with the opportunity to build      something large and important for which they previously      have had neither the opportunity nor the experience. The      concept of simple structural beauty as a part of the      environment is an important one. It gives great      satisfaction to participants to find that they can make      useful structures that are esthetically pleasing as well.    </p>    <p>      T he design of this contemporary yurt is the result of ten      years' effort to develop techniques that make it possible      for children and unskilled adults to participate in a major      way in the creation of their own shelter. Taking part in      the ordering of an environment means having a better chance      of understanding and appreciating that environment. The      construction of a yurt allows a person to see the total      erection of a building in two or three days' time-(so      quickly as to seem like time lapse photography). To see the      same thing happen with a normal building in our society      takes months and is beyond the attention span of many.      Speed of construction also gives more people a feeling of      accomplishment before they reach their threshold of      discouragement and provides permanent shelter in the      shortest possible time.    </p>    <p>      Yurts of this design have had a wide appeal and, in      addition to their use in schools at the present time, they      are in service as summer homes on the coast of Maine and      Cape Cod; as a mountain shelter, a home, a research      station, and as student housing in Alaska; as a home in      British Columbia; and as a retreat in a Hawaiian mental      hospital. As this is written, a yurt is being built as a      sharecropper home in Mississippi, with the aid of students      from the Study-Travel-Community School. It's a good project      for these students since it is initially attractive and      exciting to them while, at the same time, it demands      cooperation, creativity and disciplined action.<br />      <br />    </p>          <h3>      HOW TO ORDER PLANS FOR THE COPERTHWAITE YURT    </h3>    <p>      The Study-Travel-Community School did it... other groups      and individuals are too . . . and so can you. Build your      very own yurt or yurts and move right in, that is. All      you'll need to tell you how is a $3.00 set of plans from      Bill Coperthwaite.    </p>    <p>      It should be noted right in front, now, that your three      Iron Men are not buying you reams of highly detailed      drawings. Instead, you'll receive a single (23" X 33")      sheet of heavy paper bearing-among other      information-the following disclaimer:    </p>    <p>      This plan is not meant to be a complete set of instructions      but a guide to the most difficult parts for those who want      the adventure of building their own yurt. If you,      perchance, get hung up, have a swim and try again with a      clearer head.<br />    </p>    <p>      That tongue-in-cheek line shouldn't scare you off, however,      because Bill's yurt design is supersimple and the sheet of      plans presents a number of crystal-clear illustrations like      the one below. I mean, what the heck. If a 15-year-old kid      can do it . . . why not you? Get your yurt recipe from:    </p>    <p>      Wm. S. Coperthwaite<br />      Bucks Harbor<br />      Maine 04718<br />    </p>    <h3>      . . . AND HEE'S WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES WHEN YOU DO    </h3>    <p>      October 1, 1970<br />      Bucks Harbor, Maine 04618<br />    </p>    <p>      An Eskimo museum is being created and unbeknownst to most      of you, the money you invested in a Yurt plan was helping      to make this project possible.    </p>    <p>      The museum is a collection of artifacts and films from      Eskimo life across the Arctic. It will travel to the Eskimo      villages of Alaska with the intention of creating greater      knowledge and respect among the Eskimo people for their      cultural heritage. This will be a small, mobile museum      going from village to village by plane, snowmobile and dog      sled.    </p>    <p>      For the last three years I have been assembling this      collection and preparing to take it into the field. This      fall it will come about under the sponsorship of the      University of Alaska, the Alaska State Museum, the Harvard      Graduate School of Education and the newly formed Yurt      Foundation.    </p>    <p>      The Yurt design and the publication of the plan have been      so enthusiastically received that two new organizations      have been formed.    </p>    <p>      (1) YURT DESIGNS INC., BOX 183, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS.      This is a business organization concerned with the      production of yurts and the providing of consultant help      for those requesting it.    </p>    <p>      (2) THE YURT FOUNDATION, BUCKS HARBOR, MAINE. A private      non-profit corporation has been set up so that money coming      to me from the sale of yurts or yurt plans can be more      fully used for educational purposes. The chief concern of      the Yurt Foundation will be the collecting of folk      knowledge from around the world and the combining of this      with contributions from modern knowledge for the purpose of      creating a life style which will be simpler and in more      intimate contact with the natural world while promoting      intellectual and creative fulfillment.    </p>    <p>      THE FIRST PROJECT    </p>    <p>      It is a fitting beginning that the first project sponsored      by the Yurt Foundation is one concerned with the building      of greater respect for their heritage among the Eskimo      people. It is out of great respect for the Eskimo culture,      their way of life, their folk wisdom and out of gratitude      for what I have learned from them that I go north with this      collection.    </p>    <p>      To anyone wishing more information on the Eskimo museum or      the Yurt Foundation, it will be sent.    </p>    <p>      $4,000 have been promised in gifts to date for the museum      conditional upon the raising of the additional $10,000      needed to complete the project. Would you like to share      further in sponsoring the museum? Do you know of others who      would? If you can help financially, checks should be made      payable to the Yurt Foundation and sent to me at Bucks      Harbor, Maine.    </p>    <p>      A new issue of the yurt plan is out as of August. It has a      green sod roof (complete with goat) and more information to      ease construction.    </p>    <p>      It makes me very happy to be able to offer the opportunity      for you to be of use to the Eskimo people.    </p>    <p>      BILL COPERTHWAITE    </p>
