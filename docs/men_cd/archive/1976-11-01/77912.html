    <p>
                    <p>      The following procedures are used regularly in cooking with      tofu. Try to master them from the outset, since each gives      the tofu a unique consistency and texture. The eight      techniques listed below are in order of the amount of water      each allows to remain in the tofu. Thus parboiling, the      first technique, expels very little water, while crumbling      rids the tofu of more than 65 percent of its moisture,      leaving it very firm and containing more than 20 percent      protein. The chart with this sidebar shows the effect of      each technique on the weight, protein, and moisture content      of a 12-ounce cake of tofu originally containing 7.8      percent protein and 84.9 percent water.    </p>    <p>      When fresh tofu is mashed or blended, 9 ounces yield 1 cup,      and 12 ounces yield approximately 1-1/2 cups.    </p>		    <h3>PARBOILING</h3>    <p>      This technique is used with both regular tofu and      <em>kinugoshi</em> (a smooth-textured tofu made from thick      soymilk) for at least four different purposes: [1] to warm      the tofu before serving it topped with hot sauces, [2] to      freshen stored tofu that shows signs of spoiling, [3] to      make the tofu slightly firmer so that when simmered in      seasoned broths it absorbs flavors without diluting the      cooking medium, [4] to impart to the tofu a slight      cohesiveness desired when preparing <em>aemono</em>      (Japanese-style tofu salads).    </p><p>The addition of a small amount of salt to the water    seasons the tofu slightly, imparts to it a somewhat firmer    texture, and makes possible longer parboiling without the    tofu developing an undesirably porous structure.</p>    <p>      Because parboiling causes a slight loss in some of the      tofu's delicate flavors, it should be used only when      necessary.    </p>    <p>      REGULAR PARBOILING: Bring 1 quart water to a boil in a      saucepan. Reduce heat to low and drop in tofu. Cover and      heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until tofu is well warmed. (For      a firmer texture, cut tofu into 4 equal pieces before      parboiling.) Lift out finished pieces with a slotted spoon.    </p>    <p>      SALTED WATER METHOD: Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a      saucepan. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, drop in (uncut) 12-ounce      cake of tofu, and return to the boil. Remove pan from heat      and allow to stand for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove tofu,      discarding water.    </p>    <h3>      DRAINING    </h3>    <p>      Draining or storing tofu out of water (for no more than 12      hours) gives it a fairly firm texture and also helps      preserve its flavor, since its subtle natural sweetness is      lost quite easily in water. A 12-ounce cake of tofu drained      for 8 hours will lose moisture equal to about 17 percent of      its weight. The protein content of the final 10-ounce cake      thereby increases from 7.8 to about 8.5 percent.    </p>    <p>      Place the tofu in a 1- or 2-quart flat-bottomed container.      Cover well and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours or, for a      firmer texture, overnight. If set on a small colander or      folded towel placed into the container beforehand, the tofu      will drain even more thoroughly. If two cakes are stacked      one on top of the other, the one on the bottom will be      almost as firm as if it were pressed (see below). If the      tofu was purchased in a sealed plastic tub, prick a tiny      hole in bottom of tub, drain out any water, and place tofu      and tub in container as described above.    </p>    <h3>PRESSING</h3>    <p>      When pressing tofu, it is important to preserve the form      and structure of the cake so that it may later be cut into      thin slices. Tofu is fully pressed when it can be picked up      and held vertically in the air without crumbling. Pressing      time may be varied to suit the dish being prepared: light      pressing preserves the tofu's softness for use in tossed      salads, while lengthy pressing gives firmer, stronger tofu      for use in deep-frying.    </p>    <p>      Because of its delicate texture and unique structure (which      holds water in millions of tiny "cells"), kinugoshi is      almost never pressed. Doufu (Chinese-style firm tofu) has a      cohesive structure and low water content and may be used      without further pressing in any recipe calling for pressed      tofu. Pat its surface dry with a cloth before use.    </p>        <p>      TOWEL AND FRIDGE METHOD: Wrap the tofu firmly in a small      terry-cloth or cotton towel folded into fourths (facing),      and set on a plate in a refrigerator for 1-1/2 to 2 hours      or overnight. To decrease the pressing time, drain the tofu      beforehand, place a 2- or 3-pound weight on top of the      tofu, and replace the damp towel with a dry one after about      30 minutes. Or cut the cake horizontally into halves before      pressing and place in the towel as illustrated below.    </p>    <p>      SLANTING PRESS METHOD: Wrap the tofu in a towel or bamboo      mat (sudare)-or sandwich the tofu between bamboo      mats-and place on a cutting board, tray, or large      plate next to the sink. Raise the far end of the board      several inches. Set a 2- to 4-pound weight on the tofu and      let stand for 30 to 60 minutes (below).    </p>        <p>      SLICED TOFU METHOD: Cut the tofu crosswise into 1/2- to      3/4-inch-thick slices and arrange on two towels placed on a      raised cutting board (below). Cover the slices with a      double layer of towels and pat lightly to ensure even      contact. Allow to stand for 30 to 60 minutes. This method      is commonly used when preparing tofu for deep-frying. For      faster results, top with a cutting board and 5-pound weight      and change the towels after 10-minute intervals.    </p>    <h3>SQUEEZING</h3>    <p>      This process results in a mashed tofu that is slightly      cohesive and has a texture resembling that of cottage      cheese.    </p>        <p>      Place drained, parboiled, or pressed tofu at the center of      a large dry dish towel and gather its corners to form a      sack. Or use a tofu pressing sack if available. (      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: see MOTHER NO. 41, page</em> <em>41</em>      .) Twist sack closed, then squeeze tofu firmly, kneading it      for 2 or 3 minutes to expel as much water as possible      (below). Squeeze lightly enough so that no tofu penetrates      the sack. Empty the squeezed tofu into a mixing bowl.    </p>    <h3>SCRAMBLING</h3>    <p>      This technique causes a further separation of tofu curds      and liquid whey resulting in a texture similar to that      produced by squeezing, but one which is slightly firmer and      more crumbly.    </p>    <p>      Place tofu in an unheated skillet. Using a (wooden)      spatula, break tofu into small pieces. Now cook over medium      heat for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly and breaking      tofu into smaller and smaller pieces until whey separates      from curds. Pour contents of skillet into a fine-mesh      strainer. Allow curds to drain for about 15 seconds if a      soft consistency is desired, or for about 3 minutes for a      firmer consistency. Spread curds on a large plate and allow      to cool to room temperature.    </p>    <h3>RESHAPING</h3>    <p>      This process yields a tofu cake having a very firm and      cohesive consistency similar to that of natural cheese or      processed ham. Called <em>oshi-dofu,</em> or "Pressed      Tofu", in Japan, it is used in recipes calling for pieces      the size of French-fried potatoes which hold their shape      during cooking or tossing.    </p>    <p>      The first method given below takes about twice as long as      the second, but yields a tofu that retains more of its      natural flavor and texture. The addition of salt that it      calls for prevents the tofu from developing a somewhat      elastic, web-like structure while also seasoning it. The      second method yields a firmer structure that holds together      better during sautéing. The tofu undergoes a slight      loss in flavor that is not very noticeable if served with a      well-seasoned sauce in the typical Chinese style.    </p>    <p>      FIRM SEASONED TOFU: Combine 24 ounces tofu and 1 teaspoon      salt in saucepan; mix well. Stirring constantly, cook over      medium heat for about 4 minutes or until tofu begins to      boil vigorously. Pour the tofu into a cloth-lined colander      in the sink and allow to drain for several minutes.      Transfer the cloth onto a cutting board and carefully fold      the edges of the cloth over the tofu. Shape the tofu into a      cake about 5 inches square and 1 inch thick. Place a pan      filled with 3 or 4 quarts of water on top of the cloth      (below) and press for 1 to 2 hours in a cool place. Unwrap      and cut as directed . . . or re-wrap in a dry towel and      refrigerate for later use.    </p>        <p>      VERY FIRM TOFU: Boil the tofu in unsalted water as when      crumbling (see below). Drain tofu, then proceed as above,      pressing the tofu for 30 to 60 minutes.    </p>    <h3>CRUMBLING</h3>    <p>      By reducing its water content to a minimum, we can obtain      tofu with much the same texture as lightly sautéed,      crumbly hamburger. Yet the tofu is slightly firmer,      lighter, and fluffier, which makes it ideal for use in      tossed salads, egg and grain dishes, spaghetti or curry      sauces, and casseroles.    </p>    <p>      Combine 12 ounces tofu and 1 cup water in a saucepan. With      a wooden spoon or spatula, break the tofu into very small      pieces while bringing the water to a boil. Reduce heat and      simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Place a colander in the sink and      line with a large cloth (or a tofu pressing sack). Pour the      contents of the pan onto the cloth, gather its corners to      form a sack, then twist closed. Using the bottom of a jar      or a potato masher, press the tofu firmly against the      bottom of the colander to expel as much water as possible.      Empty the pressed tofu into a large bowl and allow to cool      for several minutes. Now break the tofu into very small      pieces, using your fingertips or a spoon.    </p>    <h3>GRINDING</h3>    <p>      This process yields tofu having much the same light, dry      consistency as crumbled tofu, but with a texture that is      finer and more uniform.    </p>    <p>      Using either regular tofu or kinugoshi, prepare reshaped or      crumbled tofu (described above). Refrigerate tofu in a      covered container until well chilled. Then, cutting into      chunks if necessary, run through a meat grinder with a      medium-fine attachment.    </p>
