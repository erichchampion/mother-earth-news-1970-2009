    <p>
                <p>      IS THIS THE WORLD'S FIRST COMPETITIVELY PRICED SOLAR-HEATED      AND -COOLED HOME THAT QUALIFIES FOR FEDERAL HOUSING      AUTHORITY AND VETERANS ADMINISTRATION BACKED FINANCING?    </p>        <p>      Until just a few weeks ago anyone who wanted to live      in a solar-heated and -cooled house found the construction      of that dwelling to be pretty much a do-it-yourself affair.      (There simply weren't any "ready-made" sun-powered homes on      the market.)    </p>    <p>      And who could really afford the expensive construction of a      custom, one-of-a-kind solar-tempered building anyway? For      that matter, who (other than the local banker's favorite      grandchild) could even obtain financing for such a "crazy"      idea? Who indeed?    </p>    <h3>      COMES THE DAWN!    </h3>    <p>      Some folks down in Greenville, South Carolina (folks who go      by the name of Helio Thermics,      Inc.)-however-have now changed all that.      They've changed it by designing, building, and making      readily available [1] a "standard" solar-heated and -cooled      dwelling that [2] is very competitively priced and [3] is      among the very first-possibly <em>the</em>      first-such structures to qualify for both FHA and VA      mortgage insurance.    </p>    <p>      As impressive as the name (Helio Thermics, Inc.) may sound,      this threefold "breakthrough" in the use of solar energy      wasn't made by any overstaffed and over-financed      foundation, government agency, or corporation. Helio      Thermics is actually little more than three brothers . . .      Randy, Mike, and Larry Granger. Three brothers who-in      their backyard, so to speak-studied some U.S.      Department of Agriculture research data (which is freely      available to anyone) and then-based on that      information-designed, built, and refined an      exceptionally clever solar-heating and -cooling system.    </p>    <h3>      FIRST THINGS FIRST    </h3>    <p>      One of the most impressive things about the Granger      brothers is that, unlike far too many experimenters in the      field, they didn't try to design their sun-powered system      "wrong end to". That is, they did <em>not</em> become so      embroiled in the usual "my collector is more efficient than      your collector and my method of heat transfer is better      than yours" competition that they wound up-as other      experimenters have-"proving" themselves "right" with      a funny looking, lopsided, uncomfortable house that cost      two or three hundred thousand dollars.    </p>    <p>      Instead, they "began at the beginning" by concentrating on      the more prosaic (although, in some ways, far more      important) components of their system. Things like studding      and insulation.    </p>    <p>      The exterior walls of the prototype Helio house-which      has been in operation since February of 1976-are all      framed with 2 X 6's instead of the customary 2 X 4's. This      makes it possible for those walls to contain batts of      fiberglass insulation that are a full <em>five and      one-half</em> inches thick, rather than the "standard"      three and a half inches used in most contemporary      structures. And the ceiling of the building is insulated      with a thick 12 inches of the fiberglass . . . which is      twice the six inches recommended as "heavy" insulation for      the Greenville, South Carolina area by many authorities on      the subject.    </p>    <p>      This "extra" insulation, plus the fact that every window in      the Helio Thermics house is glazed with thermopanes (double      layers of glass), makes the building extremely easy to heat      in the winter and to cool during the summer. Or-to      put it another way-by spending a little more to      insulate their structure in the beginning (by putting      "first things first"), the Granger brothers were able to      drastically reduce the size, complexity, and cost of      everything that followed.    </p>    <h3>      THE COLLECTOR    </h3>    <p>      The economies of Randy, Mike, and Larry's approach to the      construction of a sun-warmed and -cooled house are perhaps      most obvious when you inspect what is usually one of the      most expensive of all the components that go into such a      system: the collector. The Grangers' building-in the      strictest sense-doesn't even have one!    </p>    <p>      What the boys did was take something (the attic) that      virtually all houses have anyway and, at very little      additional qxpense, modified it into a "hot air solar      absorber". This modification was actually quite simple.    </p>    <p>      Since the optimum angle for the placement of a solar      collector is generally considered to be latitude plus 15      degrees, and since Greenville, South Carolina is located      approximately 35 degrees north of the equator, the      south-facing slope of the attic's roof was set at 50      degrees to the horizon. Translucent, reinforced,      tedlar-coated, corrugated fiberglass sheeting ("Filon", the      brand named panels used on some greenhouses) was then      attached with weatherproof screws directly to the rafters      on that side of the attic in place of standard roofing      material.    </p>    <p>      This created 400 square feet of "collector" . . . at the      rockbottom cost of only about $2.50 per square foot! That's      an exceptionally low figure, as anyone experienced in the      construction of solar collectors will tell you. Especially      low, in fact, since <em>two layers</em> of the Filon were      fastened to the whole 400 square feet of collector surface.    </p>        		    <p>      The double thickness of corrugated translucent sheeting      that covers the Helio home's "solar absorber" is      cross-laminated both to add rigidity and to increase the      insulating value of the Filon panels. The first layer of      the sheets was laid horizontally on the attic's south face      and then the topping layer was run vertically (to better      shed rain, snow, and other moisture). The half-inch-thick      plywood floor and opposite wall of the attic's interior      were then painted flat black so the collection chamber      would absorb the incoming rays of the sun more efficiently.    </p>    <p>      This was all done, quite obviously, to make the      attic/collector a better heat trap during the winter. But      what about those hot South Carolina summers? What keeps      that double layer of translucent plastic and those absorber      panels of black plywood from turning the attic into an      unbearably hot solar oven during the months of July and      August?    </p>    <p>      V-e-r-r-r-y simple. By opening a series of vents along the      ridge of the attic's roof and immediately under its eaves,      the Grangers have found they can create a surprisingly      effective natural "air conditioner" for that part of the      house. The more the air in the loft is heated, in other      words, the faster it rises out the ridge vents and the more      it draws cool air in through the openings under the eaves.      Believe it or not, USDA tests have shown that this entirely      natural flow of air can keep summer temperatures in the      attic as much as 40 <em>degrees Fahrenheit</em> lower than      the attic temperatures in "ordinary" homes located in the      same neighborhood as the Helio Thermic dwelling.    </p>    <p>      So: By merely opening the vents along the ridge and eaves      of the attic, that section of the Granger house can be      naturally air conditioned during the summer. And by just as      Simply closing those same vents, the modified attic can be      converted into a very effective solar collector.    </p>    <h3>      THE DELIVERY AND STORAGE SYSTEMS    </h3>    <p>      Of course, if Randy and Mike and Larry had stopped right      there, they wouldn't have had much of a solar-tempered      house on their hands. Few people spend all their time up in      the attic. Besides, taken just this far and no farther,      there'd be no way to store the attic/collector's excess      warmth or cold during any given period and then use it at a      later time.    </p>    <p>      So the boys tucked 1,100 cubic feet (60 tons) of washed,      egg-sized rock under the building. And they connected this      "heat sink" to the attic with a network of ducts, dampers,      and louvers so that-among other functions-a      blower (the Grangers call it an "air handler") can draw      air-either hot or cold-from the attic. And that      air can be used to heat or cool either the building's main      floor or the crushed stone in the storage pit underneath.      And-if stored-the captured warmth (or coolth)      can always be extracted from the storage area on demand and      blown into the house's living space. by the      1,600-cubic-foot-per-minute fan (driven by a half-horse      electric motor) that is the heart of the building's air      handler.    </p>    <h3>      THE LITTLE "BLACK BOX"    </h3>    <p>      All very well and good. It's easy to see how the Helio      Thermics house can capture hot air in its attic on a sunny      winter day (or cold air on a cool August night) and then      either blow that air into the structure's living quarters      or down into its rock storage area for use at a later time.      But it's also easy to see that the mere switching of vents      and louvers and dampers could soon turn into a full-time      job for someone.    </p>    <p>      ("Let's see now. I'm collecting excess Btu's in the attic      and the house is cold so I'll pump some heat from the attic      to the living area. Whoops! Too much. Better switch a      little down to the storage pit. Wait a minute! A cloud just      went in front of the sun . . . shift all the warmth we can      collect to the house again. Yes . . . NO! Too much. Maybe      if we . . . on the other hand . . . WAIT A MINUTE!!!")    </p>    <p>      So the Grangers built a full-time "someone"-an      electronic control unit-right into their house to      continuously take care of this chore. The "solid state      black box" is about as big and as complex as a small TV set      and, just like most modern color TV's, has removable      curcuit boards for easy service and repair.      <em>"Unlike</em> the average `boob tube', however," say the      Grangers, "our black box is designed to work darn near      forever."    </p>    <p>      The control unit (actually a mini-computer) constantly      monitors the temperature in five locations: [1] the Helio      Thermic building's collector/attic, [2] the structure's      living area, [3] the central portion of the rock storage      pit, [4] the outer edges of the storage area, and [5] the      atmosphere surrounding the house. With this continually      updated information always "in mind", it then decides which      heating or cooling source and what mode of operation (there      are eight modes) will most economically keep the building's      living space at the temperature set on the black box's      console dial.    </p>    <p>      As it deems necessary, the control unit will [1] heat the      house with Btu's drawn down from its attic or [2] stash      those therms away in the storage pit below. Then again, it      may decide [3] to pull some of that collected warmth back      up out of crushed stone and distribute it to the      structure's living area. It may even [4] tap into a very      small supplemental source of heat to augment the solar      collection and storage system during unusually long periods      of overcast weather.    </p>    <p>      The control unit can also [5] cool the building with      outside air or [6] cache some of that coolness in the      storage bin. And it can [7] make the decision to draw      collected cold air from the storage area under the house      and blow it into the living space, or even [8] distribute      the output of a regular air conditioner.    </p>        <h3>      THE BACKUP HEATING SYSTEM    </h3>    <p>      The Grangers are quick to admit that-just like most      solar-heated structures-their Helio Thermic house can      be temporarily "put out of business" by three or more solid      mid-winter days of heavy cloud cover. Unlike a great number      of other sun-warmed buildings, though, theirs is so well      insulated that it can be supplementally heated with nothing      but an ordinary 50-gallon, quick recovery, gas-fired      domestic water heater!    </p>    <p>      The hot (140° F) water is pumped through a heat      exchanger (something like an automobile radiator) within      the Helio Thermic air handler. There, some of its thermal      energy is transferred to the air passing around the heat      exchanger's coils and the warmed air is then distributed      throughout the house.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly enough, the water which returns from the      exchanger is still hot enough (130°) to pipe right into      the dwelling's plumbing for washing, bathing, and other      household uses. And-at current natural gas prices in      the Greenville area-a whole week (which would be, to      say the least, highly unusual) of heating the entire Helio      Thermic prototype with this backup source of warmth has      been calculated to cost only $6.80.    </p>    <p>      And if that irregular and highly unusual expense bothers      you, you should realize that the Granger boys are more than      getting it back on a regular basis directly from their      building's attic/collector. What they've done, you see, is      paint some copper tubing black, lay it out on the attic's      floor and then connect one end of the bed of piping to the      bottom and the other end to the top of an electric water      heater's tank (the unit's heating element has been      removed). This very simple solar-powered heater can warm      its water to a torrid 170° F and it supplies the Helio      Thermic prototype with a large part of all the hot water      its residents need.    </p>        <h3>      THE BACKUP COOLING SYSTEM    </h3>    <p>      Even though it was never actually necessary to      supplementally cool the Helio Thermic house during its      first summer, the Grangers did do a limited amount of      experiments with the idea just to see how it would work.    </p>    <p>      "You can bolt a big air conditioner right into the      building's ducting and use it to 'overpower' any      uncomfortable heat in the house on a really hot day if you      want to," says Mike. "We think it's a lot smarter and less      costly, though, to u se a much smaller conditioner and just      run it on the few nights when the outside air temperature      doesn't drop enough to cool the rocks in the structure's      storage bin. On such nights, the small conditioner can be      used to cool the storage pit . . . and then the bin of      rocks used to cool the house during the following day."    </p>        <h3>      . . AND THE LIVIN' IS EASY!    </h3>    <p>      You don't have to be an engineer with a degree in      thermodynamics to live in the Helio Thermics house, nor do      you have to tolerate idiosyncrasies in the structure that      only an inventor would live with. Quite the contrary. The      dwelling boasts all the modern comforts that most Americans      expect . . . or, at least, have come to want.    </p>    <p>      Do you like your living space maintained at a constant 68      or 70 degrees? Then just set the control unit at that      temperature. The only additional effort you'll have to make      to guarantee your year-round comfort will take place in the      spring (when you'll flip a master switch from its "heating"      to a "cooling" position) and in the fall (when you'll flip      the same switch back again). Everything else will be taken      care of automatically.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, you'll almost think that your heating      and cooling bill is being automatically handled by the      Helio Thermics control unit too. Because the average      monthly cost of operating the prototype house has been only      about $5.00 . . . instead of the $35 to $40 that it      "should" cost to heat and cool a house of 1,100 square feet      in the Greenville area.    </p>    <h3>      BUT WHAT ABOUT INITIAL EXPENSE?    </h3>    <p>      Then again, everything-even "free" heating and      cooling-generally winds up costing something. And in      the case of solar-powered houses, that "something" is      usually a heart-stopping increase in the original purchase      price. (Yes, Virginia, there really are prototype      solar-heated homes that cost $ 300,000 ! )    </p>    <p>      Luckily for all of us, the Helio Thermics house ain't      anywhere close to the $300,000 category. To be more      precise, its 1,100 square feet of living space-2 X 6 studs,      extra-thick insulation, collector/attic, air handler,      storage pit and all-is priced at just $24,000 . . .      complete. And that's only about $4,000 more than a gas or      electric heated home- <em>without all</em> <em>the      extras</em> <em>-</em> currently costs in Greenville,      South Carolina.    </p>    <p>      This means that if the Granger brothers' prototype saves      its residents $35 a month (as it has already proven it can      do), the house will save enough in fuel alone to make up      the $4,000 difference in less than 10 years. And that's if      gas and electricity never cost any more than they do right      now. If the price of energy continues to escalate (and it      will) as it has during the past few years, the Helio      Thermic will pay off the you can adapt some of the helio      thermics concepts to your own house difference even sooner.      And after that, of course, its continued year-after-year      savings will be pure gravy.    </p>    <h3>      AND IT CAN BE FINANCED!    </h3>    <p>      Best of all (for us ordinary people who seldom find      ourselves with an unexpected $24,000 to spend in a single      lump), the Helio Thermic solar house can be      <em>financed.</em> The design is one of the very      first-if not <em>the</em> first solar-heated and      -cooled home-that has been approved for mortgage      insurance by both the Federal Housing Authority and the      Veterans Administration. (NOTE: FHA and VA mortgage      insurance is granted at a regional level and what qualifies      in one area may not necessarily be accepted in another. But      the Helio Thermic <em>has</em> been approved by both      agencies in the Greenville, South Carolina area and there's      <em>no</em> good reason for it not to be approved in other      regions of the country. And soon. Especially if you decide      that you want to build one of the houses where <em>you</em>      live.)    </p>    <h3>      BUT WILL IT WORK UP NORTH?    </h3>    <p>      Even though the Grangers constructed their prototype      dwelling down in what most folks consider to be "The Sunny      South" . . . Randy, Mike, and Larry state that their design      should perform as well in cooler climates as any other      solar heating system now on the market. Probably better      than most, since the Helio Thermic house (except for its      add-on water heater in the attic) has no pipes to leak,      corrode, break, or freeze.    </p>    <h3>      SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?    </h3>    <p>      The Granger boys are quick to add that their particular      design for a sun-powered house-or any particular      design for such a structure-probably won't please      <em>everybody.</em> But it's obvious that they have      justifiable reasons for being just a little proud of "the      house that Randy, Mike, and Larry built".    </p>    <p>      Let's face it: The Grangers-without hundreds of      thousands of dollars in government or foundation grants and      without the backing of a multi-million-dollar      corporation-have gone one heck of along way toward      ushering in the Solar Age for John Q. Public almost      singlehandedly.    </p>    <p>      Sure others have built some darn good solar-heated and      -cooled houses. (Steve Baer, Harold Hay, and Harry      Thomason, to name just three of the reigning geniuses in      the field.) And other have built those houses almost      singlehandedly by themselves, with no help from grants or      big corporations. (Steve Baer, Harold Hay, and Harry      Thomason, to name the same three geniuses again.)    </p>    <p>      But, as far as we know, this is the first time that anyone      has ever come up with a sun-powered house that both heats      and cools itself, looks the way that Joe Suburb and his      wife think a house should look, carries a price tag that      Joe can afford . . . and has been stamped "approved" by the      FHA and the VA. If that doesn't open up solar houses to the      mass market, I don't know what will.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      you can adapt some of the<br />      helio thermics concepts to your own house    </h2>    <p>      Can you adapt any of the Helio Thermics ideas to your own      house? "You betcha," say the Granger brothers. "We haven't      really done anything that is beyond the reach of any      reasonably handy family."    </p>    <p>      Even though the pitch of your home's roof is probably far      from optimum and even if its southern-most oriented slope      doesn't face exactly south, you can most likely use the      attic to capture enough of the sun's warmth to be      worthwhile.    </p>    <p>      Just remove the roofing material from the rafters on the      roof's southern slope (and if it doesn't have one, a      western slope is a distant second choice). If you do have a      southern slope to work with and you can handle the extra      investment in labor and expense, you can dramatically      increase the efficiency of the finished conversion by      reframing that face of the roof to make its angle equal to      your house's latitude plus 15 degrees.    </p>    <p>      Then replace the removed roofing with two layers      (cross-laminated) of tedlar-coated, corrugated fiberglass      (Filon) panels as described in the accompanying article. If      you use the sheeting that is trade named "Filon", you'll      find that it's guaranteed for 20 years ...which is probably      about as long as you could have expected the original      roofing to last when it was new.    </p>    <p>      Additional insulation should then be added to the floor,      the ends, and the north-facing slope of the attic (to hold      the Btu's you'll trap once they're caught), and the whole      attic-except, of course, for the Filon-topped      slope-finished inside with a lining of plywood that is      painted flat black.    </p>    <p>      As heat is collected in this trap, it can be transferred      (when desired) to your home's living area through a sheet      metal duct. An ordinary fan mounted in the ducting and      controlled with a manual switch is all you'll actually need      to do the job . . . but a "semi-automated" system turned on      and off by a double set of thermostats is much to be      desired. Place one of the "stats" in the attic/collector      and set it so that it will only allow the fan to kick on      when there are "surplus" Btu's in the attic. The second      thermostat is then mounted in a cool corner of the living      area and set to "tell" the fan when additional heat is      needed in that part of the house.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you have the time and money and inclination,      you can always take the next logical (though very big) step      by tearing out the basement or crawl space under your      house, installing a heat storage pit, and otherwise      completely duplicating the sophisticated solar-heating and      -cooling system built into the Helio Thermics prototype.      But that would be ridiculous because such extensive      remodeling of an old building would probably cost more than      the price of a brand new Helio Thermics structure . . .      complete!    </p>    <p>      For more information about the Helio Thermics house write      to the company at 70 Delores Street, Greenville, South      Carolina 29605. And remember that the Granger brothers are      "little guys" just like you and me. Although we know they'd      love to do it, they simply don't have the resources they'd      need to send a personal answer or even preprinted replies      to everyone who'll probably contact them as a result of      this article. So please slip a couple of bucks into your      envelope if you do write to the boys.-MOTHER.    </p>

Cool air (blue) enters the return duct (at right) and travels to the far side of the rock storage area, where it absorbs stored Btu's prior to re-entering the cycle. Heavy insulation?and a virtually airtight house?are what make it possible.

In modes 1 through 4, the vents in the eaves (and atop the attic) are closed to retain heat during cool weather. In modes 5 through 8 (warm weather), these same vents are opened... thereby allowing the attic to cool through convection. Mode 4 illustrates the most complex?and least often used?heating cycle, in which water is pre-heated by the collectors in the attic, then brought to even higher temperatures by a gas-fired heater, and finally passed through the heat-exchange coils in the ""air handler"".
