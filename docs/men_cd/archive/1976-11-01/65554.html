                    <h5 id="byline">      By BILL SUTO:    </h5>    <p>      My wife and I had always wanted to raise our own bacon,      but-because we live on a small lot in a Florida real      estate development-we hesitated to buy a real, live      pig. Problem is, you just can't have a porker or two      running around on the lawn (or worse, <em>other</em>      people's lawns) in a neighborhood like ours.    </p>    <p>      Still, despite our less-than-perfect locale (and despite      the fact that we'd never raised a hog before), we were      determined that <em>someday</em> we'd give pig ownership a      try.    </p>    <p>      As luck would have it, a friend of mine approached me at      work one day last year-about, a week before      Christmas-and asked if I wanted to buy a pig.    </p>    <p>      "Nope," I answered, and went on to list my reasons.    </p>    <p>      "But you can give it to your wife for Christmas," my      co-worker said, half jokingly.    </p>    <p>      Well I mulled that suggestion over awhile . . . and decided      that, by gosh, a pig <em>would</em> make one hell of a good      Christmas present! (It certainly wouldn't be the sort of      thing my wife would expect or forget.) So-putting      aside all thoughts of neighbors and lack of space-I,      looked my buddy square in the eye and said, "OK. I'll take      it!"    </p>        <p>      Thus, when Christmas morning rolled around, I had a      thoroughly surprised and delighted wife . . . plus a      seven-week-old pig! There was just one little problem: The      small wire cage in which I'd brought our plump little      friend home was much too tiny to serve as his permanent      residence. Our piglet obviously needed a much larger home .      . . and right away.    </p>    <p>      So we built a simple pigpen consisting of one full sheet      (4' X 8') of exterior-.grade 1/2-inch plywood (for the      floor) set in a cradle of four 48" X 56" two-by-four      frames, and some eight-foot-long pine boards for siding. I      call it the "Quick and Easy" pigpen, because it goes      together quickly and easily with the aid of just a few      basic hand tools. (! spent around $30 on our pen. . . but      only because I chose to use all-new lumber. You should be      able to put together a similar sty for much less-if not for      free-from recycled materials.)    </p>    <p>      To construct "Pork Chop's" pen, I first nailed two      48-inch-long two-by-fours to the ends of a 56-inch-long      two-by-four-and closed the open side of the resulting      rectangle with a 1" X 2" furring strip-to make one of the      sty's four main frames. Then, after fabricating three more      identical rectangles, I simply [1] stood them all upright,      [2] spaced them an equal distance (about 32") apart, [3]      laid the 4' X 8' sheet of exterior-grade half-inch plywood      inside the four sections of framing, and [4] nailed the      plywood floor down.    </p>    <p>      I used 8-inch-wide pine boards, eight feet long and spaced      four inches apart, for the pen's sides. It's important to      nail these planks to the inside of the stall, by the way.      (If you were to spike them to the outside of the pen, the      hog would eventually push them loose as he banged against      and scratched his rump on the planks.)    </p>    <p>      We mounted gate boards on one end of the pen so that we      could slide them in or out (see diagram). This made it easy      for us to let our growing porker out regularly while one of      us got in to clean his quarters. (We closed off the other      end of the sty with a piece of plywood that was cut to fit      and spiked on with extra nails. We also covered that end of      the pen with a simple plywood roof to give our piglet a      little shade.)    </p>        <p>      Although some folks might think it cruel to raise a hog in      such a small area, it's not. Ours lived like a king for the      four months we kept him. We changed his bedding of hay or      oak leaves (raked from the lawn) every day or two, and      buried the old bedding in the garden (to help keep down      unwanted odors and-at the same timefertilize our plants).      We also fed Pork Chop rather lavishly twice a day . . . and      when it came time to butcher the animal, he tipped the      scales at 225 pounds!    </p>    <p>      When all was said and done (and eaten), we figured the cost      of our homegrown, home-butchered, and homecured pork at      around 45 cents per pound . . . which isn't too bad, for a      first attempt at hog-raising.    </p>    <p>      And it certainly never would've happened right here in a      Florida development without the Quick and Easy Pigpen!    </p>
