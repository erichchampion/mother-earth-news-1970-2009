                        <p>      <strong>WHO'S GIVING WHOM WHOM A BREAK TODAY?</strong>      According to a report in <em>Nutrition Action,</em> a      McDonald's Restaurants franchise owner has moved his entire      operation right into the Benton High School cafeteria in      Benton, Arkansas . . . and has managed to build a booming      business by replacing fruits, vegetables, and "other      unpopular foods" with Cokes, shakes, fries, and Big Macs.      The owner is quoted as saying that "We've had no complaints      from parents except for one mother, who said she wished we      wouldn't serve McDonald's food at lunch because that's what      she likes to feed her child at dinner."    </p>    <p>      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>FOLKS WHO RAISE RABBITS,      CHICKENS, OR OTHER SMALL LIVESTOCK</strong> may be      interested in a new 13-page booklet entitled "Accounting      for the Homestead". The publication-which explains      and illustrates a simple method for keeping accurate      cost-versus-production records-is available for $2.00      from the Institute for Tomorrow, 4900 Vulcan Ave., El Paso,      Tex. 79904.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL      QUALITY</strong> has reported that up to 90 percent of all      cancer in humans is caused by environmental factors, many      of which are man-made. Despite that fact, however, most of      the $800 million doled out every year by the National      Cancer Institute is spent in pursuit of a <em>virus . . .      the</em> existence of which remains unconfirmed after      decades of study. Critics of the so-called "war on      cancer"-including Dr. James Watson, a Nobel prizewinning      biochemist-charge that "the American public is being sold a      nasty bill of goods", and that much of the money involved      is used just to "perpetuate pre-existing programs". They're      also quick to point out that the cancer cure rate has      increased by "only about 1 percent" since the 1950's . . .      .    </p>    <p>      <strong>JUST EXACTLY HOW MUCH DOES "THE WASTEFUL SOCIETY"      WASTE?</strong> Well, according to the National Association      of Recycling Industries' 1975 figures, the story goes      something like this: enough aluminum to build 18,700 jumbo      jets, enough paper to save 765 million trees, enough steel      and iron to build 80 million cars . . . and tens of      millions of tons of copper, lead, zinc, textiles, and other      perfectly recyclable materials. And yet, municipal      officials all across the country are scratching their heads      and wondering what to do with all the "trash" that's      filling their cities' landfills.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAHEGNAY SOUAMlN OF BOMBAY, INDIA HAS      DISCOVERED</strong> a new-although somewhat      questionable-technique fog recycling automobiles.      According to the Zodiac News Service, the Indian fakir has      managed to eat an entire Chevrolet by dismantling the car,      cutting it into tiny pieces, and then swallowing a few      tidbits each day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL IS BEING "LOVED TO      DEATH"</strong> according to Paul C. Pritchard, executive      director of the Appalachian Trail Conference. In 1968,      approximately 600,000 men and women walked portions of the      Maine-to-Georgia    </p>    <p>      pathway, but-this year-the number is expected      to jump to over 4 million. At some points, says Pritchard,      hikers pass each other <em>every 20 seconds.</em>      Meanwhile, other less "famous" trails go virtually unused,    </p>    <p>      <strong>LOOKING FOR A WAY TO FIND AND FINANCE A      HOMESTEAD</strong> all in one fell swoop? Then you might      take a tip from Mr. and Mrs. John Klein (9932 Loralinda      Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45239) who have renovated an old      school bus and now operate a kind of "budget travel      service" from Cincinnati to San Francisco. The Kleins make      one four-day trip every month during the spring and summer      and-each time-carry 17 to 20 passengers who pay      just $59 apiece for the one-way ride. The cash goes toward      the couple's future homestead . . . which they have plenty      of time to search for on their way back to Ohio.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"WASTED PEOPLE" AS WELL AS PEOPLE'S WASTE ARE      RECYCLED</strong> as a result of Newark, New Jersey's      "Project Resource". The two-year program has put      approximately 150 so-called "unemployable" former convicts      to work collecting old newspapers (which are then sold to      recycling centers). Officials say that-before the      project-approximately $430,000 worth of paper was      tossed away into city landfills every year. Now, however,      much of the "waste" is profitably retrieved . . . and the      ex-prisoners gain on-the-job experience which prepares them      for other employment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A POIGNANT REMINDER OF MAN'S FOOLISH AND      IRREVERSIBLE WAYS</strong> is served up in <em>A Passing In      Cincinnati,</em> a booklet which tells the tragic story of      "Martha"-the last passenger pigeon on      earth-whose death in 1914 marked the end of "the most      impressive species of bird that man has known". Published      by the Department of the interior as part of its      "Bicentennial historical vignettes" series, the book is      available for 65 cents from the Superintendent of      Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,      D.C. 20402. Ask for stock number 024-000-00824-0.    </p>    <p>      <strong>19 COUNTRIES ARE NOW CAPABLE OF PRODUCING NUCLEAR      WEAPONS</strong> , and-according to a report issued      by the Stockholm International Peace Research      institute-the number will in all likelihood grow to      thirty by 1980. The Institute's studies also show      that-in 1975 alone-the nations of the world      spent $280 billion on weaponry. And half of all the arms      sold that year, says SIPRI, went to the Middle East . . .      "the most militarized region in the world".    </p>
