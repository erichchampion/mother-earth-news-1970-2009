                <p>      Here, from a resident of British Columbia's far northwest      corner, is a Compleat Survival Manual for the Pilgrim      Facing His or Her First Winter With a Privy. And for all      you folks with indoor plumbing: Rejoice, rejoice!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Wayne Merry    </h5>    <p>      Regardless of what anyone says, there is <em>one</em>      advantage to having an outhouse in the colder regions of      our land: Namely, you don't have to worry about frozen      plumbing. The prospect of actually having to use an outdoor      potty at thirty below, however, is horrifying to most      folks. (It's enough, in fact, to throw the average      tenderuh-foot's body functions completely out of whack!) A      recent arrival from wanner climes even confided to my lady      that she dreaded the possibility of having to present a      strategically located frostbite for treatment at the local      outpost hospital.    </p>    <p>      And yet, a trip to the arctic or subarctic biffy doesn't      <em>have</em> to be an exercise in stark terror: You      <em>can</em> overcome most of the inconveniences, if you      know how.    </p>        <p>      SEAT TEMPERATURE The temperature of the outdoor commode's      load-bearing surface is our most immediate concern.      Imagine-if you dare-the sensory and emotional      impact of sitting on a seat forty degrees colder than the      average ice cube . . . a frost-caked surface cold enough to      freeze water instantly with an audible crackle. One way to      ease this "impact"-as suggested in MOTHER NO.      31-is simply to hang the john's seat behind the      kitchen stove when the lid is not in use, and then take it      with you when you go to use "the facilities". The idea      works, too . . . though fastidious sorts aren't usually too      pleased with the idea. And, if you have small kiddies who      are still developing dexterity and accuracy, the concept      further lacks appeal.    </p>    <p>      Then again, you may want to try a technique I first spotted      at a ranch near McKinley Park in Alaska. The rancher there      had obtained a horseshoe-shaped seat (such as commonly      found in public restrooms) and pulled an old woolen sock      over each half of the lid. It was marvelous.    </p>    <p>      The absolute ultimate, though (believe it or not), is the      styrofoam seat. (OK. So it's plastic. Can you think of a      better use for plastics?) Such a lid is a snap to make: All      you have to do is [1] find a two-foot-square hunk of      2"-thick insulating styrofoam (or any piece big enough to      extend well beyond the edges of the privy's opening), [2]      outline the hole in the latrine on it, and [3] cut the      center out of the block with a keyhole saw. (The seat's      usable "as is", but does tend to break easily unless      reinforced. Hence, you might like to cement the foam to a      scrap piece of plywood that's been cut to size.) Tack a      couple of blocks to the outhouse bench's top to keep the      new seat from sliding around, and presto! You've got an      insulated perch you can slide into place whenever the frost      fiends are sufficiently vicious.    </p>    <p>      This-I guarantee-is the warmest and most      comfortable seat you can imagine (even if you forget and      leave it out in the snow on a night when the temperature      plunges to fifty below). It feels <em>heated,</em> as      though there's an electric element inside! With a foam lid      like this, you no longer need fear discomfort or      moon-shaped frostbites.    </p>    <p>      (You might even want to build the next loo facing north, so      you can leave the door open and admire the aurora borealis      in comfort, as you peer out from between your styrofoam      foundation and down parka.)    </p>    <h3>      FROST BUILDUP    </h3>    <p>      A lesser-but still significant-problem      associated with an outhouse up here in the far north is the      frost that sometimes builds up inside the structure. It can      make the interior of the building utterly beautiful when it      coats walls and ceiling with thick layers of giant,      iridescent crystals and transforms each cobweb into a long,      swaying strand of gems.    </p>    <p>      Your appreciation of the aesthetics of the situation      generally vanishes quickly, however, when you realize that      the source of all this sparkling beauty is the . . . vapor      . . . . from . . . . . the . . . . . . pit. Then too, the      crystals are so fragile that the mere closing of the door      can jar loose a tinkling snowstorm that-if nothing      else-is sure to cover you liberally. (Even if you use      the utmost stealth and reach your destination without      causing the slightest structural vibration, you may still      be confounded as the vapor of your own breath adds the      final milli-microgram needed to touch off an avalanche from      the heavily laden cobweb hanging directly above the back of      your neck! It raises hell with meditation.)    </p>    <p>      You won't be able to lick the frost problem entirely. About      the best you can do is [1] leave a tight, flat cover on the      opening in your Chic Sale's bench when it's not in use to      prevent vapors from rising into the building, and [2] prop      the privy's door open during warm spells so that the      crystals can vaporize and be wafted away. (If the cold snap      is prolonged enough to fill your outhouse with frost      anyway, just bang the structure on the outside with your      fist before you enter. This'll knock loose any storms which      hang in wait. Then you can ignore the source of the      crystals as you settle down inside and pretend you're in a      geode. It's pretty, anyway.)    </p>        <h3>      STALAGMITES    </h3>    <p>      A cold-weather phenomenon that's unheard-of except in      the north is the Outhouse Stalagmite, a sharp and slender      spire that grows with amazing speed from the darkness of      the pit and quickly threatens to violate the upper sanctum.      This problem you fight with violence.    </p>    <p>      Inside an outhouse at a station on the Canol Road in the      Northwest Territories there's an immense, cavemantype club      resting in a corner under a sign that reads    </p>    <p>      In this land of ice and snow<br />      The refuse pile just grows and grows<br />      But lo, behold this mighty club<br />      With which to smite it in the bud!    </p>        <p>      Chances are, you'll find an old two-by-four leaning against      most far north outhouses during the winter. Now you know      why. The stalagmites become brittle when frozen and are      easily fractured. In short, they're no real threat. (Just      don't forget and use that same two-by in the construction      of your sauna next spring!)    </p>    <h3>      CANDLES, MATCHES, AND MOISTURE    </h3>    <p>      Many northerners make an effort to keep their biffies      bright and cheery with colorful paint, pictures, and a      candle for light. If you decide to install such a light in      your outhouse, though, make it short enough to cover with      an inverted jar when it's not in use (to prevent the candle      from becoming heavily frosted and difficult to light).      Matches, too, must be kept in a sealed container, and that      extra roll of tissue should be tightly shut inside a coffee      can so that <em>it</em> doesn't get soggy.    </p>    <h3>      PORCUPINES    </h3>    <p>      Don't forget to latch your outhouse door on windy nights so      the building doesn't drift full of snow. This'll also help      to keep out porcupines, who seem to have a passion for the      salts found on biffy benches. While porky visits are more      commonly a summer occurrence, I did once notice-just      in time, I might add-one of the spiny critters inside      the shallow pit of an old privy out in the bush. (The      incident had all kinds of frightening potential!)    </p>    <h3>      IT'S NOT SO BAD    </h3>    <p>      That about covers the major annoyances associated with the      sub-zero outhouse. Other winter privy problems fade into      the background, once you have these solved.    </p>    <p>      In any case, the minor inconveniences posed by frozen      facilities are nothing (in my mind) compared to the hazards      "faced" by those who use the outhouse in some southern      states . . . states where easily offended black widow      spiders frequently hang just under the seat. I'll take      porcupines, any day.    </p>
