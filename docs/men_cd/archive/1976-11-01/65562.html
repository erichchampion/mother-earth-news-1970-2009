    <p>
                    <p>      Three years ago, Robert Richardson gave up his career as a      teacher, moved to the country... and stepped right into a      unique $15- to $35-per-day (plus meals) job that few      back-to-the-landers-it seems-have heard of.      Here, Bob tells us all about his novel-and      profitable-line of work.    </p>    <p>      If you already live in the country and need a good, steady      source of extra income-or if you've made up your mind      to move to a rural area but you don't know how you'll earn      a living once you get there-I know at least one line      of employment that you should check out. It'll let you [1]      meet people on equal terms, [2] have the sunniest hours of      the day off, and [3] learn a lot about dairy animals in a      short time.    </p>    <p>      Why not, in other words, think about becoming a milk      tester-or "field(wo)man"-for the Dairy Herd      Improvement Association?    </p>    <p>      The DHIA fieldman helps dairy farmers keep accurate milk      production records on each of the animals (usually cows,      but sometimes goats) in their herds. More specifically,      this is how you'll spend your time if you do land a job as      a fieldman:    </p>    <p>      In the late afternoon, you'll drive out to a farm      and-unless your host prefers to eat after milking,      which is sometimes the case-sit down with the dairy      farmer's family and eat supper. Once this formality has      been satisfactorily taken care of, you'll accompany the      dairyman, his wife, and their children (if they are to      help) out to the barn for the evening milking.    </p>    <p>      Then, as each cow is milked, you'll weigh her output and      record the weight beside the animal's name or number on the      "barnsheet" you've brought along for this purpose. You'll      also collect and tag a small sample of each cow's milk for      a butterfat analysis that will be conducted later.    </p>    <p>      The next morning, you'll return to the same farm      and-except for eating breakfast this time instead of      supper-repeat the procedure. (A few years ago, it was      common practice for milk testers to stay overnight on the      farms they visited. One woman who works in our association      still does this, since most of the farms she covers are      located some distance from her home . . . but her situation      is now an exception to the rule.)    </p>    <p>      After you've finished breakfast and the cows have been      milked, you'll return to the DHIA laboratory you work out      of and drop off the milk samples and barnsheets. And that's      it . . . until about six hours later, when-in the      late afternoon-you'll visit another farm.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO QUALIFY    </h3>    <p>      If all this sounds pleasant and easy, it is. And you don't      need prior dairy experience to land one of these jobs! My      "qualifications" before becoming a fieldman were threefold:      [1] years before, as a youngster, I had milked a cow that      my dad kept, [2] I had once raised a dairy heifer as a 4-H      project, and [3] I answered the ad. And, except for the      fact that they gave me enough confidence to apply for the      job, the first two points actually were irrelevant.    </p>    <p>      Believe me, this job's been done-and done      well-by many people who, until they became fieldmen,      knew nothing about dairy work. One of my co-workers-a      man who's been testing milk for the last 14 of his 74      years-came to this occupation straight from a long      stint with a dog track in Florida. Before that, he'd been a      chauffeur in Chicago.    </p>    <p>      So don't let the fact that you've never seen the inside of      a barn before (if that's the case) intimidate you. If you      can pour milk out of a cup, you can become a DHIA milk      tester!    </p>    <h3>WHY TEST MILK?</h3>		<p>Perhaps you're wondering      (and I don't blame you) just why anyone should be paid to      go around and collect these samples of milk. The answer is      simple. All cows eat a lot, but not all cows give a lot of      milk. And a dairy farmer-if he's to make well-founded      decisions about the feeding and breeding of his      herd-needs to know exactly which cows are the "big      producers". (Finding heavy milkers isn't as easy as you      might think, because you can't <em>see</em> their milk as      it flows from the teat cups of a modern automatic milker      through a pipeline to the milkhouse cooling tank. All you      know for sure is that the cow stood there with the milkers      on her for a certain length of time . . . which doesn't      necessarily say anything about how much milk the old gal      gave!)    </p>        <p>      By having his herd tested, then, a dairy farmer is able to      learn precisely how much milk each of his animals produces      from month to month and how much butterfat that flow      contains. (The higher the fat content, the more the      dairyman is paidper pound-for the milk.) This      information-in turn-helps the farmer to decide      such things as how much feed a given cow should receive,      and to what bull she should be bred. (The finer points of      feeding and breeding are, of course, quite complicated. In      general, though, a heavy milker usually needs and gets a      heavy ration of grain . . . while an animal that produces a      heavy flow of milk with a consistently low butterfat      content will probably be bred to a bull that has a record      of improving butterfat production in his offspring.)    </p>        <p>      As you can see, the DHIA testing program gives dairymen a      good deal of valuable information that can help them make      more money. Your job is to pick up a few bucks for yourself      by helping to provide that information.    </p>    <h3>WHERE TO APPLY</h3>    <p>      The DHIA testing program is sponsored by the Department of      Agriculture and is affiliated with the Agricultural      Extension Service in each state. Hence, if you want to      check out your chances of obtaining employment as a      fieldman, your best bet is to call or write the County      Agricultural Extension Agent in the county where you live      (or intend to live). He'll know about the DHIA program and,      in fact may be the person who manages it and hires the      fieldmen in your area. And if he doesn't, he'll know who      does.    </p>        <h3>TRAINING</h3>		<p>Once you've been hired an      experienced fieldman will take you out on his or her route      a time or two and quickly teach you the essentials of the      job. Then-after you've worked a couple of weeks on      your own and seen what the job entails (and you're sure you      want to stay with it awhile)-your local association      will send you to fieldman's school (probably at the land      grant university in your state) for a week of instruction.      There, you'll learn about DHIA work in greater detail and      be given a broad introduction to the care, feeding, and      breeding of dairy animals . . . after which you'll return      to the area in which you live to carry out your duties as      an experienced, trained milk tester.    </p>    <h3>RATES OF PAY</h3>    <p>      You won't accumulate a fortune as a fieldman . . . but      then, you won't exactly starve, either. Rates of pay vary      from one local association to another and are generally      higher in the Northeast and Far West than the Midwest or      South. Here in Wisconsin (where rates are about average), a      typical wage is $10 per day-your "basic supervision"      fee-plus 11 cents per cow . . . which means that a      fifty-cow herd can net you $15.50 (plus two homecooked      meals) for a day's work. And that's just the beginning.    </p>    <p>      You see, <em>owner-samplers</em> -dairymen who aren't      interested in having official DHIA test records, but who DO      want to know how much milk each of their cows produce (and      how much butterfat is in that milk)-can easily double      a fieldman's wages.    </p>    <p>      Here's how it works: Let's say you have three      owner-samplers (with herds of 30, 60, and 90 cows) on your      day's route in addition to the fifty-cow herd mentioned      above . . . not an unlikely scenario. OK, on your way out      to perform evening tests you'll leave a barnsheet-and      a box of sample bottles-in each owner-sampler's      milkhouse. Then, in the morning-on your way to the      lab-you'll pick up the sample bottles that you      dropped off the night before, bring them in for analysis,      and receive a tidy 11 cents per cow (but no supervision      fee) for doing so. Which makes your day's wages $35.30 . .      . not $15.50. (Quite a boost, considering that you've      hardly gone out of your way to earn it.)    </p>    <p>      Between basic supervision fees and owner-sampler income,      then, you should have no trouble making about $400 to $700      per month as a fieldman (assuming you work five days a      week) . . . not counting the money you'll save by eating      away from home most of the time!    </p>    <h3>FRINGE BENEFITS</h3>    <p>      Although the DHIA testing program is sponsored by the      Department of Agriculture, it's actually organized and run      on a local level by participating dairymen, who elect a      governing board from among their own ranks. Consequently,      as a DHIA milk tester, you work for <em>the dairymen</em>      <em>themselves</em> <em>.</em> (You're not an inspector or      a salesman, so your presence on a farm is never an      imposition or an unwanted intrusion.) In effect, the      dairyman is inviting you to his farm once a month to      <em>work with him</em> <em>.</em>    </p>    <p>      This-in turn-provides the basis for one of the      finest "fringe benefits" of the job: personal friendship.      By getting to know the farmers you work with, you'll      establish enduring personal relationships . . .      and-at the same time-acquire something else      that every newcomer to country life desperately needs:      information.    </p>    <p>      Most dairymen like their work and like to talk about it.      (Whether or not you've got the gift of gab, the words will      flow . . . believe me!) So use that fact to your advantage      by asking all those questions you have about dairy cattle      and other farming subjects . . . you're sure to get plenty      of free professional advice!    </p>    <p>      Also, if you're looking to buy a calf-or some hay for      use as mulch in the garden-by all means ask. You're      close to the source of both. And are you in the market for      a piece of land? One of the dairymen you work with may have      acreage to sell, or know of a neighbor who does. (And if      you're looking for a dog or cat, you'll have to learn to      say no unless you want dozens of them!)    </p>    <p>      DHIA field work-as you can see-gives you direct      and easy access to the ordinary activities and daily flow      of country life. Which is something you can't say about      very many other jobs.    </p>    <h3>ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES</h3>    <p>      One nice feature of this line of work is that it leaves you      free during the middle of the day (from 10:00 or 10:30 a.m.      to 4:30 or so) to raise a garden, build a house, write a      book, or do anything else you want. There's also a good      chance that you can adjust the length of your workweek to      fit your economic circumstances. For instance, some      fieldmen-who look upon milk testing as a source of      both income and social life-like to work seven days a      week . . . while I prefer to go out only three or four.    </p>    <p>      Then too, one fieldman's job could easily be divided      between two people, each of whom takes on half the usual 20      to 24 herds to be tested per month. It shouldn't be too      difficult to find an association manager who'll agree to      such an arrangement. If he needs help and thinks you and      your partner will be dependable, you'll probably get the      job . . . because in most areas, good fieldmen are hard to      find and the turnover is high. (Thus, even as a job      applicant you can deal from a position of <em>some</em>      strength when making such a proposal.)    </p>    <h3>DISADVANTAGES</h3>    <p>      The fact that fieldmen tend to come and go may suggest to      you that the job has its disadvantages . . . and you're      right.    </p>    <p>      The most obvious drawback-ironically-is the      work schedule itself. Getting up before the roosters each      morning isn't everybody's idea of fun . . . despite the      fact that the world's always fresh-and often      glorious-just as the sun comes over the horizon.      Nonetheless, farmers <em>do</em> milk their cows early in      the morning and early in the evening (usually at 6:00 and      6:00), and you have to be there, even if the roads are bad      and it's 25° below zero.    </p>    <p>      DHIA field work also has a disruptive effect on family      life. Of course, you may-if you live      alone-relish eating breakfast and supper at somebody      else's table all the time . . . but if you live with family      or friends, you-and they-may come to regret      your routine absence at mealtime.    </p>    <p>      Then too, one of these field jobs can put a real damper on      your nighttime activities. You won't be able to get started      on anything before 8:00 or 8:30 p.m. And you'll have to      curtail each night out mighty early if you want to wake up      feeling rested before dawn the following morning.    </p>    <p>      One more thing: Cows are veritable volcanoes of organic,      highly odorous activity. In other words, they smell. You      can get used to this, of course, if you want to . . . but      not everyone wants to.    </p>    <h3>THE IDEAL JOB?</h3>    <p>      Still and all, if you're looking for something that'll      allow you to [1] provide an important service, [2] meet a      lot of interesting people, [3] learn a good deal about farm      life, and [4] earn a livable wage in the process, you'd      have to search far and wide-in my opinion-to      beat DHIA field work. (Especially if you enjoy eating out!)    </p>    <p>      Come to think of it, I'd probably have moved to the country      a lot sooner if I'd known-before I got      here-that there was a job waiting for me as a DHIA      milk tester!    </p>
