    <p>
                <p>      Got a large pot and some empty coffee cans? According to      Ruth Ross of Spring Valley, New York, that's all the      equipment it takes to cook up some of the richest,      moistest, most <em>health</em> <em>ful</em> dessert breads      (and dinner breads and any-old-time breads) you've ever      laid tongue to!    </p>            <p>      Moist and delicate, slightly sweet and abounding with bits      of fruit . . . it's the fanciest bread of all! You know      what I'm talking about: date-nut loaves. The ones that go      great with cream cheese . . . and cost about $1.17 a pound.      (Then too, who can resist those deliciously tender      loaves-in-a-can known as Boston brown bread? Their velvety      slices transform a simple baked-bean supper into a glorious      meal . . . but at 75 cents a can, what price glory?)    </p>    <p>      No doubt about it, these wonderfully rich, tawny brown      loaves are a sheer delight to eat. But the price! Alas,      <em>that's</em> what's hard to swallow.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, I can show you how to make these same      delicacies at home . . . <em>without</em> an oven,      <em>without</em> kneading, <em>without</em> using white      flour or sugar, and <em>without</em> the sky-high price      tags. All you need are [1] a few one-pound coffee cans, [2]      a pot (with cover) large enough to hold them, [3] some      cookie cutters to support the coffee tins inside the pot,      and [4] a single burner atop a stove. I call this my Basic      Steaming Kit, and I use it to <em>steam-bake</em> a variety      of delectable breads and cakes for <em>just pennies per      loaf.</em>    </p>    <h3>      HERE'S HOW I DO IT    </h3>    <p>      First, I make up a batter . . . then I grease my coffee      cans, fill 'em about halfway (to allow for rising), and      cover each one snugly with a plastic lid or aluminum foil.      Next, I set the dough-laden containers on cookie cutters in      the bottom of a deep pot, fill that pot with just enough      water to submerge the cutters, and set the whole works on a      burner. Finally, I cover the pot and let it simmer for      about two hours . . . until the neat, cylindrical loaves      are done to perfection.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, it's not necessary to hover over that      steaming pot for those two hours either . . . you can go      off and read a book, if you want. (It <em>is</em> a good      idea, however, to check from time to time to make sure that      all the water hasn't boiled away.)    </p>    <h3>      SOUND BODY, SOUND POCKETBOOK    </h3>    <p>      The nice thing about making your own steamed breads is that      you control what goes into each loaf. I've adapted my      recipes to work with whole grain flours, bran flakes, brown      rice, and honey . . . and you, of course, also can      substitute whatever ingredients you generally use. (Just      remember: old-fashioned roughage-which you don't get      in modern-day white flours-and honey-which your      body responds to differently than it responds to refined      sugar-are better for you.)    </p>    <p>      Where fruit is called for, feel free to substitute. A      windfall of most any kind of fruit can be incorporated in      the recipes that follow, and since it will all be cut up,      it needn't be blemish-free.    </p>    <p>      Be resourceful . . . use whatever's most abundant and/or      least expensive. If dates skyrocket in price over the      holidays, wait till winter's over and grocers have marked      the fruit down to half price. (Shelled nuts, too, plummet      in price after they've been on the shelves a certain length      of time.) In the meantime, use raisins or pitted prunes . .      . and if raisins are high this month, leave 'em out of the      recipe altogether! The resulting bread will be good, just a      little bit smaller in size.    </p>    <p>      For the biggest money savings of all, <em>buy your      ingredients in bulk.</em> You should have very little      trouble obtaining staple foods-grains, flours, honey,      dried fruit-at half price (or even less) this way.    </p>    <p>      You say you have no place to put 25-pound sacks of whole      wheat and brown rice? No problem. Store them in plain view!      We bought some 30-pound-capacity olive containers from the      local delicatessen for 50 cents apiece, and the      terra-cotta-colored tubs-filled with flour, rice, and      whatnot-look right at home in our living room.    </p>    <h3>      A WORD ABOUT CANS AND MOLDS    </h3>    <p>      You don't <em>have</em> to cook your steamed breads in      one-pound coffee cans. Any size container you think would      make a good-looking loaf will work. (Remember, though, that      batter baked in smaller cans does cook faster.) If you      steam your loaves in several different sized containers,      you can stack them in tiers, wedding cake style. (Those      round containers that fruitcakes and cookies come in are      ideal for making the bottom layers.) And, if you      <em>really</em> get hooked on steam baking, you'll soon      find yourself-like me-hunting down fancy molds      at garage sales.    </p>    <p>      For everyday use, however, I prefer ordinary one-pound      coffee cans-the kind that come with plastic      lids-because their tops can be used to hold heat      inside the containers as the baking takes place. The only      disadvantage to the plastic lids is, that after a steaming      or two, they warp or split . . . at which point you must      either scrounge up some more coffee tins with lids, or      begin to seal the containers with aluminum foil. (And the      foil, of course, can be reused many times.)    </p>    <p>      By the way, if your cans are-like most coffee      containers-ridged along the inside, don't worry about      your luscious nut loaves getting stuck and not coming out      when they're done. Surprisingly, what happens is that the      loaves actually <em>shrink away</em> from the can's sides      as they cook, making it a simple task-when they're      finished-to turn them out to cool.    </p>    <p>      And if your "large pot" isn't deep enough to hold coffee      cans, don't fret. You can substitute No. 303 cans, which      aren't quite as tall (but which <em>can</em> be sealed with      those plastic lids).    </p>    <p>      A small hint for those who have gas ovens: Wash and dry      your cans and molds when you've finished baking and store      them in the oven (I also keep my iron frying pans there) to      keep them from rusting. The pilot light generates enough      heat to keep the air inside the oven warm and dry.    </p>    <p>      Now for some recipes:    </p>    <h3>      BLUEBERRY GINGERBREAD    </h3>    <p>      Here's a sweet 'n simple, no-risk recipe to get you      started. water    </p>    <p>      1 package of gingerbread mix<br />      1 pint of fresh blueberries    </p>    <p>      Add water to the gingerbread mix as per the instructions on      the package. (There's no need to add an egg, however.) Fold      in the blueberries. Spoon the batter into two greased      coffee cans . . . then cover the cans with lids or foil,      set them on cookie cutters inside a large pot, add just      enough water to the pot to submerge the bottoms of the      cans, and bring the water to a boil. Cover, reduce heat,      and simmer for two hours. (Note: It's OK to peek under the      coffee can lids, and it definitely is advisable to check      the pot now and then to make sure that all the water hasn't      boiled away. If it looks as though it might, add a little      hot tap water.)    </p>    <p>      At the end of the steaming period, remove the cans from the      pot, take off their lids, and-when they're cool      enough to handle-run a knife around the insides of      the containers. Finally, turn the loaves out gently onto a      convenient surface to cool. Then slice one and serve it hot      with ice-cold whipped cream . . . or cold with a glass of      milk. Either way, it's utterly scrumptious!    </p>    <h3>      STEAMED DATE AND HONEY BREAD    </h3>    <p>      This recipe calls for more ingredients than the one above,      but is really no harder to prepare . . . and certainly no      more difficult to eat! 2 cups of yellow cornmeal    </p>    <p>      2 cups of rye flour<br />      1 cup of whole wheat flour<br />      1 cup of bran flakes (health food store variety)<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      1 teaspoon of cinnamon<br />      2 teaspoons of double-acting baking powder<br />      1 cup of honey<br />      3 cups of skim milk, reconstituted from powdered skim      milk<br />      1 cup of chopped, pitted dates<br />      1 cup of chopped walnuts    </p>    <p>      Combine the cornmeal, the two flours, the bran flakes,      salt, cinnamon, and baking powder in a large bowl. Stir in      the honey and skim milk, and fold in the dates and nuts.      Then spoon about 2-1/2 cupfuls of batter into each of three      well-greased coffee cans (or equivalent containers) and      cook according to the instructions given for Blueberry      Gingerbread.    </p>    <p>      Serve: the sliced, cooled bread with cream cheese. (You can      store leftovers-if there are any!-wrapped, in      the refrigerator.)    </p>    <h3>      BOSTON BROWN BREAD    </h3>    <p>      Follow the Date and Honey Bread recipe, but substitute two      cups of raisins for the dates and chopped nuts.    </p>    <h3>      YEAR-ROUND FRUITCAKE    </h3>    <p>      The great thing about this fruitcake (as opposed to the      more traditional kinds) is that it needn't be allowed to      mellow for weeks or months before it can be eaten. To the      contrary: It can be-and frequently is-consumed      fresh from the steam pot!    </p>    <p>      You may want to use dried fruit during the winter and fresh      fruit in summer-or combinations of the two-in      place of the cranberries and dates that this recipe calls      for. (In any case, though, keep the total amount of fruit      to about three cups.) Some particularly savory      combinations, I've found, are: two cups of skinned, chopped      peaches plus a cup of chopped prunes . . . two cups of      peeled and chopped apples plus a cup of raisins . . . one      cup each of chopped rhubarb, dates, and nuts. (Cut the      rhubarb into fine pieces so you won't end up with too much      tartness per forkful of cake.) Whatever combination you      decide to try, always use a very sweet fruit-such as      dates-to balance a sour fruit.    </p>    <p>      Hint: To make a tiered cake, find a fruitcake      tin-with cover-that you can bake the bottom      layer in. (If the inside isn't as fresh and shiny as you      think it should be, line the container and its cover with      aluminum foil, grease the foil, and then proceed as usual.)    </p>    <p>      2 cups of white, stone-ground cornmeal<br />      1/2 cup of soy flour<br />      2 cups of whole wheat flour<br />      1 cup of bran flakes (health food store variety)<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      2 teaspoons of cinnamon<br />      1 teaspoon of powdered ginger<br />      2 teaspoons of double-acting baking powder<br />      1 cup of honey<br />      3 cups of skim milk<br />      1 cup of finely cut-up cranberries } or fruit of your      choice<br />      1 cup of chopped dates<br />      1 cup of chopped walnuts    </p>    <p>      Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, then fill a      greased fruitcake pan slightly more than half full with the      batter. Cover the container with a greased lid and set it      on cookie cutters in a steaming pot.    </p>    <p>      Pour the remainder of the batter into a second, smaller      container if you wish to make a tiered cake. (You'll have      to use two pots for the steaming if the fruitcake pan fills      the first one.)    </p>    <p>      Steam the bottom layer for two hours and the smaller loaf      an hour and fifty minutes. Afterwards, turn both cakes out      and-when they've cooled to room temperatureplace the larger      cake on your fanciest plate and set the smaller one on top.      Drizzle honey over all as a glaze, if you like, and      decorate the fruitcake with a sprig of holly or a holiday      candle (optional).    </p>    <h3>      CAROB TEA BREAD    </h3>    <p>      If you love chocolate-but it doesn't love      you-try this elegant, dark-brown bread. 3/4 cup of      carob powder    </p>    <p>      1-1/2 cups of mashed sweet potatoes or pumpkin<br />      1 cup of rolled oats<br />      3 cups of rye flour<br />      1-3/4 cups of honey<br />      1 cup of cornmeal (white or yellow)<br />      1 cup of cooked brown rice<br />      2-1/2 cups of skim milk<br />      1 teaspoon of salt    </p>    <p>      1-1/2 cups of raisins Combine all ingredients in a large      bowl, mix, and fill a greased six-cup towering mold to      within two inches of the top with batter . . . then pour      the remaining batter into a greased coffee can to make a      second loaf. Steam the mold for two and a half hours, and      the can for two hours.    </p>    <p>      For best results, store the fully cooled loaves in your      refrigerator for a few days to let them "ripen".    </p>    <p>      Then toast the slices of bread and serve them piping hot      with butter or margarine. The combination of      crisp-on-the-outside and moist-on-the-inside textures is      superb. (And a little melted butter never hurt anything      either!)    </p>    <h3>      MAIN DISH LOAF    </h3>    <p>      Bread was once the "staff of life" . . . meaning that you      could literally subsist on it. The following      creation-although sautéed and served like      hamburger in the end-probably qualifies as a bread in      the Biblical sense, simply because it's so chock-full of      life-sustaining protein, vitamins, and fiber.    </p>    <p>      3 cups of rolled oats<br />      1 six-ounce can of tomato paste<br />      3 cans of water (2-1/4 cups)<br />      1 teaspoon of onion powder<br />      1/4 teaspoon of black pepper<br />      2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning<br />      3 teaspoons of garlic salt<br />      1 cup of bran flakes (health food store variety)<br />      1/2 cup of soy flour<br />      1 cup of dry skim milk powder<br />      1 cup of cornmeal chili powder to taste<br />      margarine, oil, or good frying fat    </p>    <p>      Combine the oats with the tomato paste and water and allow      the mixture to stand while you round up the remaining      ingredients. Next, add the seasonings (all except chili      powder) to the oats/tomato paste/water mixture . . . then      stir in the bran flakes, soy flour, dry milk, and cornmeal.      Divide the batter equally between two greased coffee cans,      cover the batter-laden containers with lids or foil, and      steam them for two or more hours. When a knife inserted      into the center of a loaf comes out clean-with no      batter sticking to it-the loaves are done. (Allow the      cans to cool before you turn out their contents.)    </p>    <p>      Wrap the completely cool loaves and store them in the      refrigerator till needed . . . or, slice one into      patty-like rounds, heat a small amount of oil or margarine      (or any tasty fat you've been saving) in a skillet, and fry      the slices as you would hamburger. Sprinkle the patties      with chili powder as they sizzle and you won't have to ring      the dinner bell twice! (Try serving the patties with tomato      sauce-or gravy-and some cooked greens on the      side. It's fantastic!)    </p>    <p>      Note: Leftover slices can be stored in the fridge and      refried for another meal. The refried patties ire      extracrisp . . . marvelous for breakfast with lots of honey      and black coffee.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UP WITH STEAM POWER!</strong> I hope that-by      now-you're beginning to get as steamed up about      steamed breads as I am . . . and that you'll proceed      directly to the kitchen to try your hand (and a few      recycled one-pound coffee cans) on some blueberry      gingerbread . . . or date and honey bread . . . or      year-round fruitcake . . . or main dish loaf. Try a few of      these low-cost, healthful, steam-cooked delicacies and I'll      bet you give up those expensive store-bought nut loaves and      brown breads altogether!    </p>
