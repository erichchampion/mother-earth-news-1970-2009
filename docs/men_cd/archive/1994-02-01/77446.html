                    <div>      <img src="../images/142-026-01-doit_01.jpg" alt="142-026-01-doit_01.jpg" width="603" height="353" />    </div>    <p>      Outside of a drought or miracle similar to the crossing of      the Red Sea, there is no way to make a dry crossing over a      body of water without a bridge. I desperately needed one to      cross the Class One stream on our property in the western      Cascades of Oregon. So I decided to build a log bridge, one      that would meet my needs without causing damage to the      environment.    </p>    <p>      The first thing I did was take a trip to the area State      Forest office and make a request for a bridge-building      permit. That was followed by an on-site inspection by the      local forester, who decided the stream banks were level      enough so that water drainage from a road wouldn't flow      down onto a bridge and into the stream.    </p>    <p>      The permit explained the two best methods of moving logs      across a stream without harming the streambed. The method I      selected, explained below, involves an elevated-cable      system, a truck winch, and an anchored-log tripod with a      cable pulley. This allowed me to haul logs across the      stream without touching the streambed at all.    </p>    <p>      The other (more costly) method is to use a large backhoe to      lift the logs across the stream. According to the permit,      we were also responsible for reseeding those areas along      the roadway and bridge that were disrupted by our      machinery. The whole process was so simple and turned out      so well that I drew up some plans and diagrams to share      with you.    </p>    <div>		<p class="credit">      Illustration By Scott MacNeill    </p>    <img src="../images/142-026-01-illustrate_01.jpg" alt="142-026-01-illustrate_01.jpg" width="649" height="468" />    </div>    <h3>      KEEP THINGS SQUARE:    </h3>    <p>      <strong>If you have a plastic one-gallon milk container,      some plastic tubing, and water, you can make a simple water      level to even up the bunker logs.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      Bridge Construction    </h3>    <div>      <img src="../images/142-026-01-pix1.jpg" alt="142-026-01-pix1.jpg" width="591" height="177" />    </div>    <p>      Begin by finding (or, if necessary, hiring) someone with a      portable saw mill to saw planks for the bridge deck. We had      a friend cut forty 3 x 12s, sixteen 2 x 12s, and seven 4 x      6s. Fall and limb just enough cedar trees to make six 42'      span logs (which run across the stream) and two 12' bunker      logs (which hold up the span logs).    </p>    <div>      <img src="../images/142-026-01-pix3.jpg" alt="142-026-01-pix3.jpg" width="592" height="153" />    </div>    <p>      Place the larger of the two bunker logs in a shallow trench      on the accessible side of the stream (the side you're      standing on); you may have to dig a trench if a natural one      doesn't exist. Level the top. Next, position long but      narrow logs across the stream, allowing the top ends to      rest on the bunker so that they form a ramp. Using the      ramp, roll the second bunker log to the far bank.    </p>    <p>      To make sure the bunker logs are level with each other, you      can create a water level: Take 50' of plastic tubing and      stick one end through the bottom of a one-gallon container      filled halfway with water. Have one person hold the      container on the bunker log located on the accessible side      of the stream. Have another person hold the free end of the      tube on the bunker log, at the same height of the first      bunker log. If the level of water in the container is equal      to the water level at the other end of the tube, you know      your logs are level.    </p>    <p>      Next, attach the bunker logs to reinforcement bars so they      won't be dislodged while you're working. Place a 5/8"      reinforcement bar next to the bunker log and hammer it into      the ground. Then hammer a 20-penny nail halfway into the      log, bending it so that the nail makes a U-shaped curve      over the reinforcement bar and reenters the log. Do the      same for the other bunker log.    </p>    <p>      It's now time to move the span logs. Haul the logs over the      top of the first bunker and into place by constructing the      following pulley system ( see diagram ).    </p>    <h3>      CROWNING GLORY:    </h3>    <p>      <strong>For maximum bridge strength, mark the natural      curvature of the logs with a piece of chalk, and then      position the logs so that this side is facing up.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Attach a chain-log choker (which will wrap around the span      log) to a freewheeling pulley on a steel cable. This cable      should extend from the choker, across the stream, through a      pulley attached to an A-shaped log tripod (see diagram on      page 26), and back across the stream to a truckmounted      winch. The log tripod will create a pulling point      approximately eight to 10' above the streambed, and the      free- wheeling pulley on the cable will hold the log upward      and horizontal over the stream. Arrange the span logs so      that each butt end (the bottom half of the log) sits next      to a top end. This will distribute strength, making the      deck more stable.    </p>    <p>      Next, mark the crowns in each log (the natural curvature      that runs along one side of the log) so that you can place      them facing upwards; this allows for maximum bridge      strength. Cut the butt ends of the outside span logs to fit      the bunker logs.    </p>    <p>      The best way to do this is to mark the cut on the span log      while it's sitting on the bunker log with a piece of chalk      taped to a fork stick. Then level the top ends so they are      square with the butt ends. All four corners should now be      level.    </p>    <p>      Next, place one 3 x 12 deck plank at each end of the bridge      (so they are lying on top of and horizontal to the span      logs) and trim the tops of the logs so that the planks are      level and touching the top of each log (shims can be used      if tacked). To make sure that your end planks are parallel      to each other, form an `X' with two pieces of string so      that it reaches across the entire bridge from corner to      corner. If strings don't touch the center of the X, the end      planks aren't parallel. If they touch lightly in the      center, the planks are parallel. If (or once) this is true,      secure the strings to each of the four corners.    </p>    <p>      Now stretch a piece of string tightly along each side of      the bridge so the pieces run across evenly. To give your      bridge extra strength in the middle-the center is a prime      spot for future sagging-place your center plank so that it      is 1/2" higher than the side strings (and thus also the end      planks). Attach the strings to the center plank, and use      them as a guide for fitting the remaining deck plank, which      raises slightly the center of the deck.    </p>    <p>      As you're positioning the deck planks, leave a 1/4" gap      between them to allow for expansion. Rough-trim the log      tops to fit the planks by making a chain saw cut every two      inches to the necessary depth (an ax or hammer will help      you take the excess wood out). Attach the planks to the      logs below them using 12" spikes.    </p>    <p>      Once the deck is complete, place pairs of 2 x 12s along the      full length of the bridge where tires will make contact,      and one 2 x 12 on each end to cover log ends. Last, attach      the 4 x 6s along the sides of the bridge to form the side      guards.    </p>
