                <p>      COVER STORY    </p>        <p>      <strong>Effective and nontoxic products to zap pesky      bugs.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Doc and Katy Abraham    </h5>            <p>      The philosophy behind organic gardening is hardly new to      MOTHER readers, who've known about the benefits for years.      However, interest has grown markedly in the mainstream.      Many are finally joining the organic movement in order to      rebel against additives in food, chemicals in the soil and      water, pollutants in the air, and the dangerous pesticides      regularly sprayed. The balance of nature has been      precariously disturbed as the number of good and necessary      bugs has been diminished, and to make matters worse, many      of the harmful insects have developed resistance to common      pesticides. But there's good news...    </p>    <p>      Today's scientists are discovering more and more plants      that produce natural bactericides, fungicides, and      insecticides. In fact, many nontoxic household products are      considered effective in the war against gardening pests.      Below are the acceptable organic controls that gardeners      find most effective today.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Household detergents:</strong> Mix these      insecticides right in your kitchen.    </p>    <p>      1) USDA recommendation: Mix one teaspoon of liquid      dishwashing detergent with one cup of vegetable oil. Shake      vigorously to emulsify and add to a quart of tap water. Use      at 10-day intervals as an all-purpose spray for white      flies, spider mites, aphids, and various insects on      carrots, celery, cucumbers, eggplants, peppers, and others.      We've used it on evergreens and other ornamentals. Note:      Test on a single plant first, because it may cause tip      burn. This is a contact insecticide, so spray mix directly      on the pest.    </p>    <p>      2) Liquid detergent-alcohol spray:    </p>    <p>      Mix one teaspoon of liquid dishwashing detergent plus one      cup of rubbing alcohol in one quart of water. Test on a few      leaves first to make sure no harm is done to sensitive      plants. Spray top and bottom sides of leaves; or if plant      is small and potted, invert it in a large pan of solution      (holding soil ball securely) and gently swish back and      forth. Repeat in seven days.    </p>    <p>      3) Liquid detergent-hot pepper spray:    </p>    <p>      Steep three tablespoons of dry, crushed hot pepper in 1/2      cup hot water (covered) for half an hour. Strain out the      particles of peppers, and then mix solution with the liquid      detergent formula mentioned above. Good for a number of      insects on both indoor and outdoor plants. Note: Apply to      plants outdoors. Do not use on windy days. Avoid breathing      fumes, which can be irritating to nose and eyes. You can      substitute hot Tabasco sauce or Louisiana hot sauce for hot      pepper.    </p>    <p>      Pyrethrin: This natural insecticide derived from the      pyrethrum plant (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium). Along      with pyrethroid, its synthetic substitute, it is highly      effective against a wide range of insects. Each should be      used according to manufacturer's directions.    </p>    <p>      Lime sulfur: This old-timer, still used by both organic and      nonorganic gardeners, is applied during the dormant period.      Kills most species of mites as well as mite eggs and those      of many other insects. Lime sulfur also has fungicidal      value and can be used on fruit trees as well as      ornamentals. Note: Lime sulfur applied to plants near the      house will stain the paint. Apply cautiously near      buildings.    </p>    <p>      Sabadilla: Made from seeds of a South American lily. Used      for squash bugs and stink bugs. Irritating to eyes and      lungs if care is not taken. Use according to manufacturer's      directions.    </p>    <p>      Garlic and onions: Grind up raw onions or garlic into a      puree. Soak in warm water overnight and strain. Liquid can      be sprayed on roses, fruit trees, and flowers. Kills aphids      and apple borers. Scrape off any loose bark on the trunk      and swab liquid on. Many gardeners mix onion water and wood      ashes and paste mixture on tree trunks.    </p>    <p>      Ryania: Made from ground stems and roots of a South      American shrub. Controls European corn borer and other      worms. See directions on container.    </p>    <p>      Tomato leaves, crushed: To avoid chemical sprays, try using      crushed tomato leaves for leaf-spot diseases. Tomato leaves      contain solanine, a chemical that has an inhibiting effect      on black spot fungus. Grind two cups of leaves to a puree.      Add five pints of water and one ounce of cornstarch. Keep      refrigerated.    </p>    <p>      Tobacco water: Cigar and cigarette butts will kill worms in      the soil of houseplants. Mix a solution of tobacco and      water so that it is the color of brown tea; pour on the      soil. Don't let anyone drink it by mistake! The solution      kills fungus gnats, symphylids, centipedes, root lice, and      other underground pests-and it could kill you.    </p>    <p>      If you have aphids or other insects in your terrarium or      dish garden, ask a friend who smokes to blow cigarette      smoke into the glass and then seal the top. The smoke      knocks plant lice for a loop.    </p>    <p>      Snuff: For tiny flies or worms in the soil of house plants,      try sprinkling snuff on the surface. Note. Do not use      homemade tobacco remedies on tomatoes, peppers, eggplants,      and other members of the Solanum family. It could spread      tobacco virus to these plants.    </p>    <p>      Retenone: An old remedy for killing Mexican bean beetles.      It is produced from derris, a plant found in Central and      South America. Kills aphids, thrips, and chewing insects on      contact. Note: Toxic to fish and nesting birds.    </p>    <p>      Hot pepper: To discourage cats, dogs, many insect pests,      and snails from munching, dust powdered hot pepper or a      spray of hot pepper sauce on plants.    </p>    <p>      Oil and sulfur sprays: Petroleum oils (of organic      derivation) have been used successfully for killing insects      for over 200 years. Apply only on "hard" or woody plants.      There are two types:    </p>    <p>      1) Dormant oil should be used only when plants are      dormant-in winter or early spring.    </p>    <p>      2) Summer oil should be used during the growing season and      restricted to woody plants. Some oil sprays can be applied      in either summer or winter.    </p>    <p>      Miscible oil sprays kill insects and eggs such as      over-wintering leaf rollers and aphid and mite eggs. They      also kill scale insects and adult mites. Dilute with water      according to manufacturer's directions. The oils cause      little or no harm to most beneficial insects, and      resistance to sprays does not build up with oils.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Talcum powder</strong> : Effective against flea      beetles and corn ear worm. Lightly dust leave surfaces      after every rain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Soaps as insecticides:</strong> Soapsuds are ideal      for killing aphids. Many home gardeners prefer vegetable-      or plant-based soaps as effective aphicides.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rhubarb leaves:</strong> Boil one pound of chopped      leaves in one quart of water for 30 minutes. Strain and use      as a spray against aphids and other pests.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Garlic and red-pepper spray:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Grind up a large bulb of garlic (or a large onion). Add one      tablespoon of ground cayenne pepper and one quart of water.      Steep for one hour. Strain liquid into a sprayer or      watering can and refrigerate remainder in a tightly covered      jar. It will be potent for several weeks, and is effective      on all kinds of chewing and sucking insects.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Spearmint spray:</strong> Put into a blender one      cup of chopped spearmint leaves, one cup of green onion      tops, and 1/2 cup of chopped hot-red pepper. Add 1/2 cup of      water to assist in blending. Pour solution into a gallon of      water. Add 1/2 cup of liquid detergent (preferably      lemon-scented). Dilute by adding 1/2 cup of mixture to a      quart of plain tap water.    </p>    <p>      If the plant is small, dunk it in this solution, otherwise      strain it and spray on. Effective on all chewing insects.    </p>    <p>      Editor's Note: Adapted from The Green Thumb Garden      Handbook, published by Lyons & Burford (31 W 21st St.,      NY, NY 10010; 212/620-9580.). The price is $16.95.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ORGANICALLY SPEAKING: The best reason to garden      organically: clean, unsprayed, absolutely fresh fruits and      vegetables that are picked only when they reach the perfect      degree of ripeness.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      Organic Gardening: From <em>A to Z</em><br />      Time-saving tips, tricks, and shortcuts for gardeners    </h3>            <p>      <strong>Apple Maggots On the Run</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here is a brew that will trap one of the worst enemies of      your apple crop: the apple maggot. Mix one part molasses      with nine parts water, then add yeast to produce      fermentation. Pour this mixture into wide mouth jars and      hang in nearby trees.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Banana Peels</strong>    </p>    <p>      Chop banana peels and add into soil when you transplant      tomatoes and green peppers. This will ensure very strong      trunks and stems. Banana peels contain 3.25% phosphorus and      41.76% potash. They're also an excellent fertilizer for      roses, but use sparingly; two or three peels per bush at a      time is about right.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Carrots</strong>    </p>    <p>      Carrots like to grow in loose, sandy soil and if you have      clay soil you will find carrots very challenging. In      Midwest Gardening, Denny McKeown offers an excellent      solution: "Simply dig a trench 12" deep and the width of      your shovel. Mix sand and peat humus with some of the      existing soil (about 50/50), and backfill the trench. Then      plant your carrot seeds."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Daddy Longlegs</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most active at night, daddy longlegs (also known as      harvestman), prey on aphids, mites, leafhoppers, and other      garden insects.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Eggshells</strong>    </p>    <p>      Not only do they add lime, nitrogen, and phosphorus to the      soil, eggshells also help to foil cutworms when crushed and      sprinkled around seedlings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fireflies</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the larval stage the firefly can be considered of      material benefit to man. The growing juveniles eat animals      that feed on the leaves. Their favorite foods are the small      snails they share living quarters with in decaying wood and      soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gophers Gone</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you have a problem with gophers digging in your lawn try      this: put two or three bulbs of garlic, several chili      peppers, and some water in your blender and blend well.      Pour this down some of the gopher holes and rinse with a      strong stream of water from the hose.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Honeybees and</strong> <strong>Hay Fever</strong>    </p>    <p>      There's a theory that hay fever sufferers who eat honey      produced within a few miles of their homes will find that      it alleviates their misery. The pollen of the flowers and      weeds, which the honeybee makes into honeycomb, is believed      to provide a natural antitoxin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Insects</strong> <strong>Can't Slip By</strong>    </p>    <p>      Some insects that damage fruit trees crawl from the soil to      the branches to lay their eggs. They can be stopped by      wrapping the trunk with six to eight inches of tape or      grease-resistant paper and applying Vaseline or other      grease to the tape. Don't put Vaseline directly on the      tree-it may cause damage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Japanese Black Pine</strong>    </p>    <p>      This beautiful pine grows somewhat irregularly. It is an      excellent choice if you have a garden near a windy seashore      because it is resistant to both wind and salt spray. I have      also found it to be a good choice for dry, windy Oklahoma.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kiwi Fruit</strong>    </p>    <p>      Unless pruned quite heavily, kiwi will become a tangled      mass. Prune after the leaves drop. Removing the weaker      canes will encourage the stronger ones to be more      productive.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Leaf Mold</strong>    </p>    <p>      Shred leaves and mix with grass clippings to make a good      mulch. It will decompose rapidly and give mulched plants      the benefits of their many nutrients.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mice</strong>    </p>    <p>      Mice sometimes completely girdle young fruit trees.      Painting with standard tree wound paints is helpful. Or you      might try covering the wounds with white corn syrup and      then wrapping with aluminum foil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Newspaper Mulch</strong>    </p>    <p>      To make newspaper mulch for vegetables: place several      layers between plant rows, and keep them wet so they won't      blow around. Also weigh them down with a few clods of      earth. Weeds won't sprout underneath, and when the papers      decompose, they enrich the soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Owls</strong>    </p>    <p>      The tiny screech owl--more often heard than seen-patrols      moonlit yards for insects and mice. Lizards, salamanders,      and worms may also scooped up during the owl's nightly      forays. The barn owl is probably the most important      predator of rats and mice in populated areas, rivaling the      house cat in importance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Painting</strong>    </p>    <p>      Painting the trunks of fruit trees with Tabasco sauce helps      deter rabbits and mice.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Quicker Decomposition</strong>    </p>    <p>      Compost will break down and decay faster if the compost      heap is placed in a shady location.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Red Spider Mites</strong>    </p>    <p>      These little peskies seem to appear suddenly, especially on      tomato leaves, when really hot weather hits. Organic Plant      Protection (Rodale Press) states: "A spray of two percent      oil of coriander will kill the spider mite; a spray of      anise oil should do as well." Frequent spraying with plain      water will also help.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sea Shell Mulch</strong>    </p>    <p>      Save those sea shells you collected at the beach and turn      them into mulch. Face the cups of the shells upwards for      those plants that need high humidity. Each time you water,      the cups will fill with water and then evaporate into the      air around the plant. Covering the top of the pot soil with      small shells can also be very attractive.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Thinning</strong>    </p>    <p>      The sooner excess fruit is removed after flowering, the      more likely the remaining fruit will improve in size and      quality. A good general rule of thumb for apricots, plums,      apples, Asian pears, nectarines, and peaches is to thin      them twice as far apart as the diameter you want them to be      at maturity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Umbel</strong>    </p>    <p>      Umbels are the kind of blossom that a certain group of      plants produces ("umbel" means umbrellalike in shape).      These plants include carrots, parsley, coriander, dill,      caraway, anise, fennel, angelica, and chervil.    </p>    <p>      Plant umbels in moist, rich soil where they will be able to      enjoy much shade during the hot months of summer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Vetch</strong>    </p>    <p>      Vetches are used for hay, green manure, pasture crops,      silage, and as a cover crop for orchards. They are also      valuable for renewing soil fertility. Vetches require a      cool growing season. The bacteria left in the soil from      vetch roots serves as an inoculant and is beneficial to the      growth of peas.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Watch for a Cloudy Day</strong>    </p>    <p>      Bright sun can hurt newly planted seedlings, so always try      to transplant them during an overcast day in late afternoon      or evening. Shading them the first day or two is also      helpful if the sun comes out.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Xerophytes</strong>    </p>    <p>      Plants especially adapted to withstand long periods of      drought or to grow where supplies of water are scare are      called xerophytes. Included among these plants are cacti      and such succulents as aloes, cotyledons, crassulas,      echeverias, haworthias, sedums, and sempervivums. Many of      these store water in their fleshy leaves and stems.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Yarrow</strong>    </p>    <p>      Yarrow has long been acclaimed for its invaluable qualities      in companion planting, adding strength to herbs and      assisting in the battle against insect pests. Plant yarrow      in the same beds with mint, chives, thyme, parsley, basil,      oregano, or any other culinary or tea herb. Or plant it in      your flower bed to add beauty and protection.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Zigging and Zagging</strong>    </p>    <p>      Togetherness is one way to practice companion planting-get      the neighbors right in there next to each other.    </p>    <p>      Plant zig-zag rows with onions and beets or carrots and      tomatoes tucked into one another. Or use the techniques of      intercropping by planting several companions in the same      row, one of which might be a protective herb or flower.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note:</em> You can end these and other      gardening tips in In Nature's Hands available from Taylor      publishing for $15.95 postpaid (800/275-8188).    </p>
