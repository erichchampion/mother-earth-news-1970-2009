            		<p>PET HEALTH	</p>	    <p><strong>It's time we realize that kids aren't born knowing proper      pet care.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Andrea Looney, D.V.M.    </h5>            <p>      Most people would agree that caring for animals is as      educational for children as it is rewarding. Humans aren't      born with the ability to relate well to other animals (this      you may remember from watching your toddler try to pull the      fur right off your puppy). Too many adults don't seem to      realize the limitations of kids and pets when left alone      together. To teach proper handling to youngsters, adults      must first separate the old wives' tales from the facts.</p><p>		Take babies, for instance. Many families assume that aged    animals are safe when left alone with babies.</p><p> Adults don't    realize that, potentially, this is one extremely dangerous    situation. Without supervision, both can behave    unpredictably, especially toddlers and babies, who enjoy    grabbing, yanking, and pulling fur.    </p>    <p>      Dogs-who are often jealous of new infants to begin with-may      not hesitate to fight back when handled roughly. Even if a      solid relationship between baby and animal develops, the      potential for injury always exists. As a veterinarian, I      can tell you that I've seen multiple cases of small pets      being mutilated by larger children. All could have been      avoided with a little parental protection.    </p>    <p>      Intentional and repeated animal abuse by older children      should be taken extremely seriously. One of the worst      wives' tales ever propagated is that an animal-abusing      child is simply "going through a phase:' Studies have shown      that children with a history of animal abuse often progress      in this activity and perpetuate abuse to other children,      adults, and even property as they grow up. Make sure that      you, the consenting adult, keep your eyes open to these      scenes and discipline your children if you see abuse      occurring.    </p>    <p>      When you sit down to teach your children responsible pet      care, explain carefully the idea of animal dependency. Many      youngsters are oblivious to the degree of dependence that a      dog, cat, hamster, or horse has on them. Young people can      learn best by assisting with feeding and other chores-not      by tackling them alone. There are too many stories of the      tiny finch that starved in a cage even though it was fed      hours ago, or the malnourished turtle who was regularly      fed. The children didn't know that the finch eats every      hour or that the turtle is not a strict vegetarian and      can't survive on lettuce alone. Many adults probably don't      know these things either, but it seems appropriate that we      adults learn basic pet needs first and then teach them to      our children.    </p>    <p>      Last, bear in mind that dogs, cats, and horses can live 10      to 15 years, and that during this time your kids will grow      up and lead increasingly complex lives. You'll be left with      aged Fluffy or Spot still needing a home after all your      children are in school. And contrary to popular opinion,      aged animals are not disposable or simply candidates for      euthanasia. So consider your options before buying a pet.    </p>    <p><strong>Dear Andrea:</strong></p><p>      <strong>Recently I was driving through upstate New York and      noticed two llamas standing in a field. Are these pets or      production animals? Would they be suitable for the      backyard?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Earl Breckner Dayton, Ohio</em>    </p>    <p>	Dear Earl,<br />      <br />The llama, a South American member of the camel family, has      shown some popularity as of late due to its      wilderness-packing attributes and some backyard farmer's      desire for the novel pasture animal. These animals have      long graceful necks, with small refined heads, large eyes,      and long curved ears. Their hooves are very comparable to      our nails, yet cloven with soft pads on the bottom. Adults      weigh 250 to 500 pounds at maturity.    </p>    <p>      Llamas are used in their native environment predominantly      as a beast of burden or raised for meat. The wool derived      from their coat is not as desirable as many believe. Its      mixture of long hairs and fine undercoat is apparently      painstaking to separate. However, they are a quiet,      inherently thrifty animal that can survive extreme      temperatures-with the exception of high heat and humidity.    </p>    <p>      Because their behavior is strongly influenced by the herd's      structure of dominance and subordinance, they may be      suitable backyard pets if a breeding pair or small group is      kept. However, in a large herd situation, objectionable      behavior-spitting, charging, pawing, or      striking-may be used to express dominance to other      herd members and also to humans. Bottle-feeding young      animals and developing extremely close contact with cries      (baby llamas) may result in very aggressive, mature      behavior that is inappropriate for human interaction.    </p>    <p>      Feeding patterns are similar to that of a goat or deer,      with hays and grasses providing the main source of      sustenance. They are basically stock, hardy animals that      can withstand many extremes of feed and climate variations.      With such intense inbreeding currently going on in North      America, they appear to be subject to a variety of      congenital limb and gastrointestinal abnormalities.      Overall, though, they are a naturally healthy pet.    </p>    <p>      Llamas seem to have an inherent common sense and territory      respect, which makes their initial equipment and housing      requirements low. All you need are a roof to deflect      moisture and provide shade, and some form of a windbreak.      Natural shelter may be sufficient in many climates.    </p>    <p>      If you think the llama is the pet for you, there's one more      thing you should know-the price. City folks and      trendseekers longing for rural contact will pay exorbitant      prices for these elegant creatures. Females sell for      $15,000 to $20,000; males may sell for anywhere between      $8,000 and $18,000. Believe it or not, the "in" thing is to      purchase a breeding pair. If you're planning on      backpacking, a good mule may be a more economical choice.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>My cat, Sampson, is an 18-pound, five-year-old,      neutered cat who seems prone to bladder stones. He is on a      special diet with vitamins and has undergone surgery twice      for his problem. What else can we do?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Barbara Simmons</em> <em>Newport, Rhode Island</em>    </p>        <p>      Dear Barbara,    </p>    <p>      Feline urologic syndrome (FUS) is an inflammation of the      bladder and urethra that may slow or stop normal passing of      urine. It's usually associated with crystal and stone      formation and is responsible for 10% of cats' visits to the      vet. If untreated, this disease can be fatal to a cat.    </p>    <p>      FUS occurs as frequently in male cats as female cats. Yet      because of anatomical differences, actual urine obstruction      or stone blockage occurs more often in the male. The two      primary causes are a high concentration of mineral      magnesium in the urine and an alkaline (high pH) urine. The      increased magnesium can result from cats eating foods high      in magnesium, holding their urine, or not urinating enough.      It can also result from reduced physical activity caused by      indoor confinement and obesity, and drinking too little      water. The high pH urine can come from eating big meals or      many meals (fat-cat syndrome).    </p>    <p>      My first suggestion would be to have the stones that were      removed from Sampson analyzed. Your vet may be able to send      these away to a urolith (urinary stone) laboratory. Often,      the crystals seen in the urine are not reflective of the      actual crystals at the center of the stone (which started      the problem). By determining the exact composition of the      stones, you may be able to <em>prevent</em> their formation      and not just treat the secondary crystals.    </p>    <p>      Sampson's weight may be part of the problem. If it isn't a      major concern, let him outside for a few hours a day to get      some exercise and increase his fat-burning metabolism. Once      his activity increases, he will drink more, urinate more,      and the crystals will have less of a tendency to form. Try      changing his litter box too. Some cats hold their urine      because they are too lazy to climb over a too-tall box, or      they don't like the brand of litter you use or the location      of the litter box.    </p>    <p>      Check to see whether the vitamin supplement that Sampson      takes contains additives that may be contributing to the      stone or crystal formation. Finally, have your vet examine      Sampson's kidneys via ultrasound or x rays to make sure      they are not involved in the problem. Often, long-term      antibiotic therapy is necessary to help reduce the      inflammation associated with the crystal formation. Your      vet may prescribe an appropriate one for Sampson based on a      urine or stone culture.    </p>    <p><strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>      <br /><strong>I came across an article in a medical newsletter on      arthritis that dealt with the positive effects of      glucosamine in reversing arthritis. Is this beneficial for      dogs with arthritis?</strong>			<em>-Miriam Miller</em> <em>Hyndman, Pennsylvania</em>    </p>    <p>Dear Miriam,</p><p>      Glucosamine is one component of a class of body chemicals      known as glycosaminoglycans, which are found in joint      fluids and anticlotting substances. Several years ago,      articles began appearing regarding drugs composed of      polysulfated glycosaminoglycans and their possible benefit      for arthritis in the horse. However, recent studies have      shown that there may be some benefit to giving dogs these      drugs in the treatment of degenerative joint diseases.    <strong><em>LOW-MAINTENANCE HOUSING:<br /></em></strong>    <em><strong>All your llama needs is a roof to deflect    moisture, provide shade, and act as a    windbreak.</strong></em> </p><p>The most common arthritic condition    today in small animals seems to be hip dysplasia. We see this    degenerative disease in many of the small, overweight breeds,    as well as larger breed dogs. While there are many surgical    options for younger animals in the treatment of this disease,    older animals may be treated more effectively using    medication.It is extremely important to have your vet    provide older pets with pain relief for their arthritis. This    medication may consist of aspirin or other non steroidal,    antiinflammatory medications.</p><p> Injections of    glycosaminoglycans have recently been studied in the horse    and dog to determine if they may have beneficial effects in    treating canine hip dysplasia and similar arthritic problems.    Unfortunately there are still no scientific studies proving    whether there are benefits to the use of these drugs or    documenting what longterm effects they may have on the rest    of the animal's body.</p><p> Currently certain nutrition specialists    are experimenting with feed supplements of    glycosaminoglycans. Sources of these substances are    shellfish, plants, and some forms of animal cartilage. I    suspect there are no detrimental effects for short-term use,    but would not advise long-term use because of the lack of    data available. Hopefully within the next two years we will    have gained a better understanding of the absorption, side    effects, and benefits.		</p>        <p>      <strong><em>GETTING OUT OF THE HOUSE<br /></em></strong>      <strong><em>Your dogs may be digging up the lawn out of      sheer boredom. Schedule daily play sessions with      them.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>I own two Labrador retrievers who love to dig. They      have transformed my backyard into what looks like a mine      field, devastated with knee-deep craters. Any tips on      deterring them from digging?</strong><br />      <em>-Don Thompson</em> <em>Spokane, Washington</em> Dear      Don,<br />      <br />      First of all, understand that digging is destructive      behavior for dogs. A dog left alone may be tearing into the      lawn as an outlet for boredom. Alternatively, there may      have been tangible rewards buried deep within the lawn-an      old bone, food scraps, or animal remains-that the dog is      attempting to find. If the dog appears anxious and digs      only when left alone, it may be a result of separation      anxiety. Regardless of the cause, the problem is extremely      frustrating for many owners.<br />      <br />      Let's address boredom first. Silly as it may sound, most      dogs suffer from this affliction in one way or another. A      regimen of exercise, obedience training, and scheduled      daily "interaction" sessions may help deter the digging      behavior. However, exercise or attention sessions should be      scheduled and adhered to as a daily routine-rain or      shine! If you are inconsistent, the digging will probably      get worse as the animal anxiously waits for its "allotted"      playtime.<br />      <br />      If your dog simply hates being alone and suffers from      separation anxiety, you will have to help it get used to      being left alone for longer and longer periods of time.      Design a time schedule of increasing duration in which the      dog will be left by itself.<br />      <br />      Punish your dogs for digging only if you can devise a way      that won't be associated with you (such as hitting with a      newspaper). Some owners opt to place loaded mouse traps on      the spots in the yard where the dog digs. Most s cents are      unreliable because certain dogs find them attractive and      will dig deeper into the dirt to pursue them.<br />      <br />      I am more inclined to go with the reward approach, making      digging constructive as opposed to destructive. For      example, you might condition dogs to dig where you want      them to. Make a sandy digging spot in the corner of the      yard and hide some treats or bones below the surface. After      a while, start hiding the bones sporadically to reinforce      digging only intermittently. Meanwhile, if the dog digs a      hole in a nonacceptable place, you may resort to mouse      traps.<br />      <br />      If you notice one area taking disproportionate abuse, try      filling the site with rocks or chicken wire. Though      unattractive, it may help discourage digging. I believe the      best approach to your problem is probably a combination of      the above "tricks:' Persevere and allow time (weeks or      months) to change your dogs habits.<br />      <br />      <em>Editor's Note: Do you have questions regarding your      pet's health?
