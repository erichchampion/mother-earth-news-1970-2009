            		<p>LAST LAUGH    </p>        <p>      <strong>Too much oxygen can be dangerous thing.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Jeff Taylor    </h5>        <p>      W hen the first frost hit, joy and I were almost ready. The      garden was completely mulched, the tomatoes were covered,      the hoses were all properly stored, and I felt quite      confident that Jack Frost could go sit on a zucchini.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately we left a few house plants outdoors-umbrella      trees, elephant-ear begonias, lacy-leafed ferns with long      Latin names-on which the Ice Man took his revenge. Some of      the plants are quite delicate-barely alive even in full      bloom-and will grow only as a favor to people with      green thumbs, like my wife.    </p>    <p>      "These guys will come back," Joy said, bringing the      lifeless sticks inside. Back then, I wondered if she had      even noticed how stupendously dead they were. Still, joy      has proved that if a gardener is good enough, even death      cannot kill them. It's not that the plants would have been      missed. A solarium runs the full length of our kitchen, and      Joy does not let it lie fallow. Our year-round plant      population numbers in the high hundreds, reproducing like      rabbits and cross-pollinating each other on window sills      and shelves. Surrounded by green, we sit in front of the      stove for six months, sipping hot chocolate and plotting      new gardens.    </p>    <p>      Tarzan would feel at ease in our house. <em>Ficus      benjamina,</em> the weeping fig that spent all summer on      the porch, now grows high in a thicket around my desk, a      migrating Birnam Wood like the one that bugged Macbeth.      <em>Dieffenbachia</em> trees, notably one big-eared      <em>Amoena,</em> read over my shoulder. Outside, all is      deader than a frosted doorknob, but here in our winter      greenhouse, the stove fire roars and crackles, happy for      the extra oxygen.    </p>    <p>      Human brains feel much the same. Take mine, for instance. I      may lurch through the summer in a haze of physical labor,      but in winter my brain is soaked in oxygen. My life is      immersed in great blocks of free time to think and think.      And think. I call this phenomenon "The Greenhouse Effect:"    </p>    <p>      Oregon pioneers called it "cabin fever." These early      settlers (who never exactly glowed with good health) sat      inside from October to June with virtually no sunlight or      fresh air. Sometimes their windows were the bottoms of      whiskey bottles (obtained by emptying the contents). Other      times, in desperation, they'd hatchet a hole in the wall to      let a little light into their moss-festered lives. But, of      course, a plain hole turns out to have an R-factor of zero,      which can leave a house and body mighty darn cold.    </p>    <p>      To give you an idea of just how dismal housing actually was      back then, remember that pioneer cats voluntarily chose to      live out in the barn. And you can't argue with a cat's good      sense. Indeed, the Oregon domestic house cat moved indoors      only when conditions there were pleasant enough to support      plant life.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of cats, I suddenly spy Boomer, our 15-pound      orange cat who gets by on a spoonful of brains and a gallon      of apathy. His rotund body is emerging from a leafy glen at      the base of an aggressive <em>Dracaena.</em> My fingers      scamper to the end of the armchair and jump, plopping like      a spider onto his furry cat shoulders. Boomer does a      passable back flip from a lay and sinks his sharp fangs      directly into his enemy: The Hand That Feeds Him.    </p>    <p>      He seizes my forearm in his paws and starts to rowel it to      bloody ribbons, but I slide the other hand up behind his      head into a cat nelson that he can't scrape off. His look      explains that he expected this sort of dirty monkey cheat,      and he twists free with a grunt, taking a swing with fully      deployed claws that lacerate my thumb. He bounces away, and      the jungle swallows him once more.    </p>    <p>      Thumb gushing, I stare at the swaying underbrush where our      bookcase used to be. No doubt about it: We've all been      cooped up inside for way too long. Thank God we have this      jungle to keep us sane 'tit spring...    </p>
