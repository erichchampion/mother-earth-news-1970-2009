            			<p>				HOME LAW    </p>        <p>      <strong>In a new column, MOTHER provides some practical solutions      to basic legal problems.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>If you think that lawyers get paid a highly inflated      rate, you're in good company. Recent polls have uniformly      designated the profession of law as one of the least      admired in the workforce. So whether you are interested in      representing yourself a little better or are just curious      about some of the basics, here's a short primer on two</em>      <em>important legal areas. - MOTHER</em>    </p>    	    <p>      Bad weather hits your part of the country and you find your      land flooded, your house and possessions completely burned,      or the area leveled by a tornado or flattened by a      hurricane.</p><p>The plant closes and you are laid off. Between savings    and credit cards you are able to keep food on the table, but    you have missed a couple of mortgage payments. The credit    line backing up your checking account is at its limit, as is    the equity line of credit you intended to use for the kid's    college education. You were injured at work and the insurance    paid only part of the costs. You are facing constant calls    and harassing letters from collection agencies and lawyers.</p><p>    </p>    <p>      The scenarios described above are all too familiar these      days. With the slow economic recovery and the threat of      higher taxes, Americans feel as if their wallets are being      wrung dry of that last dollar bill. Some people struggle      for years and survive. Few get lucky and win the lottery.      Some turn their fortunes around, but only after changing      careers or leaving their homes for another part of the      country.    </p>    <p>      There is an alternative, however, and it is one that our      Founding Fathers thought was so important that they wrote      it right into the main body of the Constitution of the      United States. (They didn't even wait for the Bill of      Rights to come along many years later.) That alternative is      bankruptcy.    </p>    <p>      Despite the negative connotations that have been associated      with the word in the past, more and more Americans are      finding that bankruptcy-and the fresh start it      brings-empowers them to face the future with hope and      the knowledge that they are productive citizens      contributing to the good of their families and society.      Consider the alternative that was practiced in England      during the 17th century (from which our Founding Fathers      came): debtors were thrown in prison until the debt was      paid. Those who did not pay faced the prospect of      "transportation"that is, being sent in a prison ship to      mean, nasty places like Australia, New Zealand, or America      to work off the debt in "the colonies:'    </p>    <p>      We no longer have debtor's prison. What sense does it make      keeping someone who wants to work from working? We also no      longer have "transportation:" Where would the government      send people? Siberia? Mars? Bankruptcy allows people to get      a fresh start by keeping their existing creditors at bay      and allowing industrious Americans to get back to work, pay      their new creditors, pay their taxes, and join mainstream      America as productive citizens once more.    </p>    <h3>      The Stay and the Discharge    </h3>    <p>      Bankruptcy allows people with more debt than they can      presently repay (we'll call them "debtors") to take charge      of their lives. The two most important aspects of      bankruptcy are the first and last things that occur in a      bankruptcy case-and are the things that allow a debtor to      take control of his or her life. The first is the      "automatic stay"; the second, the "discharge."    </p>    <p>      A "stay" is a stop order, which is put in place by the      federal laws as soon as the first papers, called the      "petition," are filed with the bankruptcy court. This stay      is a federal stop order that freezes all the lawsuits and      actions by creditors to collect debts. The stay stops      evictions, foreclosure sales, and lawsuits. Perhaps best of      all, it stops the nasty telephone calls. Collection      agencies, when informed by the debtor that a petition has      been filed, can no longer call or write to the debtor      demanding collection of a debt. Instead, they must deal      with the debtor's lawyer.    </p>    <p>      The stay may be permanent or temporary, depending on the      circumstances of the case. But in any event, the automatic      stay gives a debtor breathing room from his creditors by      stopping all the actions that creditors may take against      the debtor to enforce an outstanding debt.    </p>    <p>      The second most important aspect of a bankruptcy filing is      the "discharge:" The discharge is the last-and most sought      after-event that occurs in a bankruptcy case. When a      debt is discharged, it is legally canceled. No person or      entity can try to collect that debt in the future. The      debtor can earn a living without the fear that creditors      will attack his future paychecks, can save money without      the fear that assets in bank accounts will be seized, and      can plan for the future without fear that the past will      make the future unbearable.    </p>    <p>      The theory here is that if debtors could not get relief      from past debts, they would never try to earn a living in      the future, for fear that future earnings would be taken.    </p>    <p>      The law encourages people to plan for a constructive future      by allowing debtors in bankruptcy to discharge their past      debts.    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind, however, that debts are not discharged unless      they are "old," remaining unpaid for a tax return filed      more than three years before the bankruptcy filing.      Similarly, certain student loans will not be discharged      unless the first payment on the loan was due more than      seven years prior to the bankruptcy filing.    </p>    <p>      A third category of debts that will not be discharged are      alimony and support payments. The property aspects of a      divorce settlement may be discharged, but the alimony and      support aspects may not be discharged. A fourth category of      debts are those that are fraudulent. An example of fraud      may include a material misrepresentation on a loan      application-overstating one's income or assets, for      instance.    </p>    <h3>      Equity and Exemption    </h3>    <p>      In many circumstances debtors can file a bankruptcy      petition and be able to keep their house, household goods      and furnishings, an automobile, and the tools of their      trade, making a fresh start in life that much easier.      Exactly which items a debtor may keep is determined by a      combination of federal and state laws referred to as the      "exemption" laws. The generally understood theory about      bankruptcy is that a debtor must "liquidate," or sell all      possessions and distribute the proceeds of the sale to      creditors. But the federal bankruptcy laws exempt various      types of property from the liquidation process, so long as      the property does not exceed a certain value.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A FRESH START Bankruptcy allows people with more      debt than they can presently repay to take charge of their      lives-to be productive again.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Believe it or not, the tax laws in bankruptcy also help a      debtor keep his house. If the trustee sells the house, the      trustee must pay the federal income taxes resulting from      the sale. In our example, if the house had been purchased      by a couple 20 years ago for a mere $50,000 and sold this      year for $150,000, the taxes on the capital gains of      $100,000 (approximately 1/3 of that amount, or $33,000)      would have to be paid by the trustee out of the sales      proceeds. So the trustee will not force the sale of a      debtor's house worth $150,000 unless the equity after      payment of the mortgage is more than the combination of the      debtor's exempt equity ($15,000), the transaction costs      (estimated at 10 percent, or $15,000 in our example), and      the capital gains tax ($33,000 in our example). In our      example of a house with a fair market value of $150,000,      the available equity would have to exceed $63,000 before      the trustee forces a sale. Therefore, a debtor with a large      mortgage may be able to keep his house, despite the filing      of bankruptcy.    </p>    <p>      In most cases, in order to keep a house, the mortgage must      be current. If payments are not current, the mortgage      holder may apply for permission to begin a foreclosure      based on the debtor's failure to pay currently. So if faced      with the choice of paying a mortgage payment or paying      other creditors, the debtor would make sure that the      mortgage is paid.    </p>    <h3>      Three Chapters    </h3>    <p>      Many of us have heard about different "chapters" in      bankruptcy, including Chapter 7, Chapter 11, and Chapter      13. So far we've been discussing Chapter 7, also referred      to as a "straight" bankruptcy. A Chapter 13 is a "workout"      for individuals. A Chapter 11 is a "workout" for      corporations or individuals with large debts.    </p>    <p>      A workout differs from a straight bankruptcy by allowing a      debtor to make payments over time. This is particularly      useful if a debtor is behind on a mortgage or equipment      loan and wants to keep the property or equipment. A workout      allows a debtor to make current payments and catch up on      the back payments over a period of time, usually three to      five years. If the workout provisions are deemed fair by      the court, the creditors may be forced to accept the plan,      even if they don't agree with all of its terms. The ability      to propose a workout is a powerful tool to help a debtor      keep his or her house.    </p>    <p>      Like a repossession or foreclosure, the filing of a      bankruptcy is shown on a debtor's credit report. So why      would anyone choose bankruptcy over foreclosure or      repossession? The difference is this: there can be no more      lawsuits or late charges on old debts after the date of the      bankruptcy filing. After a foreclosure, the creditor may      obtain a judgment against the debtor, which can be      effective against the debtor for a long period of time. A      bankruptcy filing after the foreclosure or repossession,      cuts off the ability of the creditor to take assets for      such an extended period of time.    </p>    <h3>      What About My Credit?    </h3>    <p>      Will a person who files for bankruptcy ever again be able      to get a credit card or mortgage? The answer here is      surprisingly, and overwhelmingly, yes! Consider this: The      day before filing for bankruptcy, the debtor has huge debts      piled up, has no ability to make monthly payments, and has      the ability to file bankruptcy and get the debts      discharged. A creditor views this situation as an      unreasonable risk.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, the day after the discharge is granted,      the debtor has no debt (it has all been discharged), has      the ability to make current payments on new debt (if he has      a job), and usually cannot file bankruptcy for another six      years (thus allowing new creditors at least six years to      seek satisfaction of new debts). In other words, the debtor      is much more "credit worthy" the day after declaring than      he was the day before. Part of the idea behind the fresh      start is to wipe clean the debtor's credit report. The big      myth is that we all have ratings and that they're just like      a school report card. Individuals do not have a credit      rating. What they have is a "credit history."    </p>    <p>      Reported by several companies nationally, including TRW,      this history sets a person's payment history: the record of      whether the individual made monthly payments or not and      whether the payments were made in a timely manner. A person      with perfect credit has a credit report that shows that all      monthly payments were made currently. A late payment is      shown with a number, showing the number of months late the      payment was made. The greater the number of late payments,      the worse the credit report. Events such as foreclosures      and repossessions are also noted.    </p>    <p>      So while the fact that a person filed for bankruptcy may      appear on a credit record for as long as 10 years, a person      may be able to reestablish credit to obtain a mortgage      within two years. Of course, normal underwriting      requirements must still be met, but, if after filing      bankruptcy a debtor managed to save a large-enough down      payment, established a good credit rating, and had a good      job, he or she would stand a good chance of qualifying.    </p>    <p>      Finally, debtors often ask about the moral obligations      associated with filing for bankruptcy. Clearly the decision      is very real and personal. I remind clients they are free      to repay clients later, when business gets better and the      prospect of losing one's house or business passes. The      difference is you send the check or money order when you      have the ability to do so, not when someone else demands      payment.    </p>    <p>      There is no one solution for debtors in this rapidly      changing age. Bankruptcy may not be the answer to all of      your problems. But more and more often it is being accept      ed as a reasonable alternative in this changing world.    </p>    <p>      <em>By Frank Brown</em>    </p>    <h3>      More Than A Handshake:<br />      Contracts-Your Rights of Agreement    </h3>    <p>      Which of he following five transactions are contracts:      buying a newspaper, getting married, using your credit      card, making a phone call, or sharing a car pool?    </p>    <p>      If you answered yes to all five, you were right. That's      because each of those transactions falls within the      definition of a contract, which is "an agreement upon      sufficient consideration to do or not do a particular      thing:"    </p>    <p>      Here's how that definition works out in a sampling of those      types of transactions:    </p>    <p>      When you buy a newspaper, the sufficient consideration is      the price of the paper. For it, the newspaper boy agrees to      do a particular service-namely, hand over today's copy of      the <em>Daily Planet</em> (or whatever paper it is that you      are buying). If you shortchange him or if he hands over a      copy of yesterday's <em>Tribune,</em> that's a breach of      the contract.    </p>    <p>      When you get married, the sufficient considerations are      your emotional, physical, and financial services. For it,      your spouse agrees to do a particular thing: provide      equivalent services for you.    </p>    <p>      When you make a phone call, the sufficient consideration is      the number of coins you put in the slot. For it, the      telephone company agrees to do a particular thing: put you      through clearly for three minutes to the local number      called. If you use a slug, or the phone company connects      you to a wrong number or a line heavy with static, that's a      breach of the contract.    </p>    <p>      We are by tradition and practice a society based on      contractual relations-from the informal and commonplace      (switching on electric power for the TV, getting on a bus,      ordering a hamburger) to the rigidly structured and      significant (buying a house or car, taking out a bank loan,      signing an employment contract). The legal definition of a      contract is "an agreement upon sufficient consideration to      do or not do a particular thing:" Comment legal authorities      M. J. and J. S. Ross: "In civil law, the contract is the      basic legal concept, the foundation of all legal      relations:"    </p>    <p>      <strong>A CONTRACT SOCIETY</strong> <strong>We are by      tradition a society based on contractual relations from      ordering a hamburger to taking out a bank loan.</strong>    </p>    <p>      That's why common law considers contracts binding and      enforceable in courts of law. Today's statutes on      contracts, which have grown out of the common law, are      incorporated in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), adopted      by most states. Those states that have not subscribed to      the UCC have enacted their own statutory versions of it. In      all states, the law gives you the right to enter into      contracts and to go the courts, if necessary, to have them      carried out or to provide redress when breached.    </p>    <h3>      The Basic Rules Governing Contracts    </h3>    <p>      <em>What are the essential elements of a contract?</em>    </p>    <p>      A. The offer. The offer is a promise to do (or not do)      something specific in return for the other party or parties      doing something specific (or not doing something specific).      When you promise your brother-in-law you'll pay him X      dollars to repair your plumbing if he promises to do the      job by such-and-such a date, that's an offer.    </p>    <p>      B. The acceptance. This is when your brother-in-law agrees      to your offer.    </p>    <p>      C. The consideration. Consideration is when you get      something in return (repaired plumbing) for what you give      (X dollars). Although there are some exceptions, without      consideration for each party to an agreement, there's no      contract.    </p>    <p>      These three essential elements apply whether a contract is      implied or expressed. When all the terms are specifically      expressed, that's an expressed contract. Your life      insurance policy is an example. When the terms are not      specifically expressed, but rather implied by the actions      and behavior of the parties in certain circumstances, the      law says a contract exists. That's an implied contract, the      kind you enter into when you step into a cab.    </p>    <h3>      The Offer    </h3>    <p>      <em>How do I make my offer?</em>    </p>    <p>      Any way-orally, in writing, even by sign language-provided      the person to whom you're making the offer is aware that      you're doing so. If you're making the offer by mail, it's a      good idea to send it certified. Then you'll have proof that      the person to whom you made the offer actually received it.    </p>    <p>      If I say to my brother-in-law (is a joke, I'll give you the      house if you fix the plumbing" am I stuck with a contract?    </p>    <p>      No. The law does not regard an offer made in jest as valid.    </p>    <p>      <em>How specific must I make my offer in order for it to be      valid?</em>    </p>    <p>      As specific as you can. When you offer your brother-in-law      X dollars to repair your plumbing, it's wise to also      specify when the job is to be done, who pays for the      supplies, when your brother-in-law will receive payment,      whether payment is subject to your approval of the job, and      so on. An offer that's vague about who, what, when, or how      much is not valid.    </p>    <p>      <em>After I make an offer, do I have tire right to withdraw      it?</em>    </p>    <p>      Yes. You can withdraw it at any time before it's accepted.      If you've seta deadline for acceptance, your offer is      automatically withdrawn if it's not accepted by that      deadline. If you don't set a deadline for acceptance, your      otter expires within a reasonable time.    </p>    <p>      <em>My brother-in-law rejected my offer.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Then a few days later, he said he's changed his mind      and is ready to do the job. I told him, "Sorry, but the      offer no longer stands." He says it does. Who's right?</em>    </p>    <p>      You are. A rejection terminates an offer. Another offer      must be made before he can accept. Contract negotiation is      basically a matter of offers and counteroffers.    </p>    <p>      <em>Does my offer, once it's accepted, automatically become      part of the contract?</em>    </p>    <p>      Not necessarily. An offer covers only basic terms (subject      of the contract, price, and so on). It need not include all      details, as anyone who's ever bought a house knows.      Amendments to the offer can appear by mutual consent in the      eventual contract.    </p>    <h3>      The Acceptance    </h3>    <p>      <em>My brother-in-lain wants his Plumbing fixed, and he's      made me an offer. How do I accept the offer?</em>    </p>    <p>      That depends on the type of contract that can be created by      the offer.    </p>    <p>      Should your brother-in-law say, "I promise to pay you X      dollars if you promise to repair my plumbing by such and      such a date," he is offering you a bilateral contract-an      exchange of mutual promises. You can accept a bilateral      contract in any way that clearly communicates assent-a      handshake will do; so will a nod or grunt.    </p>    <p>      But should your brother-in-law say, "I'll pay you X dollars      when you finish repairing my plumbing," he's offering you a      unilateral contract-one that becomes binding only on      performance of a specific action (or actions). You can      accept this offer only by completing the action (or      actions) called for-in this case, repairing the plumbing.    </p>    <p>      <em>On the basis of my brother-in-law's</em> offer <em>to      pay me X dollars when I've repaired the plumbing, I began      the job. Now he wants to take me off the job and give it to      somebody else. Can he do it?</em>    </p>    <p>      No. On a unilateral contract, such as this one, the person      who makes the offer cannot withdraw it once the party to      whom the offer has been made has begun to perform.    </p>    <p>      <em>I want to accept an offer, but I want to make some      changes. Okay?</em>    </p>    <p>      Not okay. Your changes constitute a rejection. You'll have      to negotiate with the person who made the offer and come to      mutually acceptable terms in order to create a contract.    </p>    <p>      <em>I had two weeks to accept an offer from my      brother-in-law. I rejected it after one week. But a few      days later I changed my mind and accepted. Since I got in      my acceptance before the deadline, l think I have a      contract. My brother-in-law says no. Who's right?</em>    </p>    <p>      Your brother-in-law. Once you've made your rejection, the      offer is no longer open, even though the deadline for      acceptance has not been reached.    </p>    <p>      <em>My brother-in law withdrew his offer while my      acceptance was in the mail. Where do I stand?</em>    </p>    <p>      If his offer came to you by mail, then your acceptance      becomes effective the day you mailed it, not the day he      received it. Your brother-in-law may not like it, but he      has a contract.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if the offer did not come to you by      mail, your acceptance only becomes effective on the date he      receives it. Since he withdrew his offer before that date,      there's no contract.    </p>    <p>      The Consideration <em>Must the consideration be money?</em>    </p>    <p>      No. It can be almost anything, even just promises made by      each party. "I promise to teach you to play chess if you      promise to teach me how to play the piano" contains the      element of consideration necessary to create a contract.    </p>    <p>      <em>What things cannot be regarded as consideration?</em>    </p>    <p>      There are three major types of quid pro quo-the legal term      for "something in return for something"-that the law      does not look upon as consideration.    </p>    <p>      1. An illegal quid pro quo. If your brother-in-law promises      you a percentage of the take if you promise to stash his      marijuana, there's no consideration.    </p>    <p>      2. A quid pro quo arising out of moral obligation. If you      promise to do something for your brother-in-law because      he's done something for you for nothing, like taking your      kids to the ball game, there's no consideration.    </p>    <p>      3. A quid pro quo involving the payment of a debt to a      third party without receiving some benefit from that party.      If your brother-in-law promises to repair your plumbing in      return for your paying off part of his debt to the finance      company, and you gain in no way from the finance company,      there's no consideration.    </p>    <p>      <em>My brother-in-law agreed to repair my plumbing for      nothing. A few weeks after he finished the job, he asked      for X dollars for his work. l say I don't have to pay. He      says I do. Who's right?</em>    </p>    <p>      You are. Consideration must be created at the same time a      contract is made-not after and not before. Without      consideration in this instance, you have no contract and      you don't have to pay.    </p>    <h3>      Creating a Contract    </h3>    <p>      Not all contracts must be in writing. But putting it in      writing helps prevent misunderstandings. Also keep in mind      that there are some kinds of contracts that are not valid      unless they are in writing. These vary from state to state;      so when in doubt, put it in writing.    </p>    <p>      An easy way to create a contract is to put it in the form      of a business letter. Prepare it in duplicate.    </p>    <p>      There are six elements to a contract and they must all be      present in the letter if it is to be considered valid.    </p>    <p>      1. A definite offer:    </p>    <p>      <em>Dear George:</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I want you to inspect the plumbing</em> in <em>my      house, located at the address on this letter, and make the      necessary repairs. l want</em> <em>this work to be      completed in 10 business</em> <em>days, commencing on May      17th of this</em> <em>year,</em> <em>during the hours from      10</em> <em>A.M.</em> <em>to</em> <em>4</em> <em>P .M.</em>    </p>    <p>      2. Consideration:    </p>    <p>      <em>In return for material and labor supplied by you, l      will pay you X dollars when you begin the job, and another      X dollars when you finish it.</em>    </p>    <p>      3. Duration of offer:    </p>    <p>      <em>I will hold this offer open for 31 calendar days from      the date of this letter. Should you fail to accept by that      date, the offer will be automatically withdrawn.</em>    </p>    <p>      4. Provision in case of partial performance or      nonperformance:    </p>    <p>      <em>In the event you do not begin the job on the date      specified in this letter, the contract will be void. In the      event you begin the job but do not finish it, the down      payment is returnable to me on demand, and you will receive      no further payment.</em>    </p>    <p>      5. Other provisions:    </p>    <p>      <em>Should any of the plumbing become defective within two      years after you make your repairs, you will make additional      repairs at no cost within three business days</em> after I      notify you of the defects.    </p>    <p>      6. Manner of acceptance:    </p>    <p>      <em>If you agree to the terms set forth</em> in <em>this      letter of agreement, kindly sign the attached copy and      return it to me by mail or by hand.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Cordially yours,</em><br />      (your signature)<br />      <em>Agreed:</em><br />      <em>Date:</em><br />      <em>George Simon</em><br />      (George's signature)    </p>    <p>      <em>Excerpted from The New</em> Jacoby & Meyers      Practical Guide to Everyday Law <em>(Simon & Schuster)      by Gail /.</em> <em>Koff.</em> <em>Copyright © 1994 by      Gail J.</em> <em>Koff.</em>    </p>
