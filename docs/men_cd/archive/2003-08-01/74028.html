                    <h3><em>Protect yourself from those pesky little bloodsuckers    with these safe, effective methods.</em></h3>    <h5 id="byline">      by Barbara Pleasant    </h5>        <p>      Humans have been taking aim at mosquitoes since 1897, when      Sir Ronald Ross identified a tropical species as the vector      for deadly malaria. Now, the mosquito's role in spreading      West Nile virus - not to mention its itchy bites      - has humans in North America up in arms. Human      infections have been documented in 39 states and the      District of Columbia, and the virus still is on the move.    </p>    <p>      It's time to get to know your local mosquitoes and lay some      defensive plans. Since the appearance of West Nile in 1999      in North America, an explosion of new mosquito-control      devices and plant-based mosquito repellents has been      underway. It's also quite possible that you can outsmart      mosquitoes on your own with some of the homemade,      Earth-friendly solutions outlined here.    </p>    <p>      West Nile is one of about 30 arboviruses of public health      concern that are transmitted by female mosquitoes, which      are the only ones that bite. The Centers for Disease      Control and Prevention says West Nile previously was found      in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia and the Middle East,      but now is permanently established in North America. The      disease is carried by 110 species of birds and transmitted      by 30 species of mosquitoes.    </p>    <p>      In humans, although infections to date are considered rare,      West Nile can cause a fever with mild flu-like symptoms,      including body aches, low energy and headache. In extreme      cases (about one in 150 people infected), West Nile      meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain      and spinal cord) or West Nile encephalitis (brain      inflammation), which comes with a severe headache, fever,      stiff neck and other serious complications, can bring      death. No specific treatment is known.    </p>    <p>      The CDC advises if you live in an area where West Nile is      widespread, seek medical attention immediately for any      severe or unusual headache.    </p>    <p>      According to the latest CDC data (2002), 4,158 confirmed      cases and 284 deaths have been recorded in the United      States. Hot spots are Illinois, with 884 cases and 64      deaths; Michigan, with 614 cases and 51 deaths; and Ohio,      with 441 cases and 31 deaths.    </p>    <p>      A single bite from an infected mosquito can transmit the      disease to a human, horse or bird. A fairly reliable      vaccination is available for horses; given in two doses, it      provides protection after about two months. For humans and      pet birds, minimizing exposure to mosquitoes is the most      effective way to avoid potential infection.    </p>    <h3>      BROAD-STROKE CONTROL    </h3>    <p>      You can lessen mosquito bites by reducing the number of      mosquitoes in an area. First, <strong>eliminate their      breeding places,</strong> which are any objects that can      hold as little as 1 tablespoon of water for seven to 10      days - the time it takes for eggs to hatch and larvae      to mature. Commonly overlooked breeding spots include old      tires, clogged gutters, abandoned tubs and buckets, and      cemetery urns. Of course, you can do an excellent job of      removing habitat and still have mosquitoes, compliments of      natural breeding areas such as tree cavities and creek      edges, or your neighbor's clogged gutters.    </p>        <p>      To learn the prevalence of West Nile virus where you live,      check the CDC Web site: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/wncount.htm" target="_blank">www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/wncount.htm</a>      . Information on West Nile virus in Canada is available      from the Health Canada Web site: <em><a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca" target="_blank">www.hc-sc.gc.ca</a></em> .    </p>    <p>      Verified Avian, Animal and mosquito infection during 2002;      no humans.    </p>    <p>      Where standing water cannot be avoided, for example in      large water troughs or ponds, you can <strong>use</strong>      <em>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bt)</em> ,      <strong>a naturally occurring bacterium</strong> that      infects mosquito larvae and kills them, yet is harmless to      people and fish. Many garden centers sell commercially      made, doughnut-shaped mosquito dunks or granulated products      containing this fast-acting biological larvacide.    </p>    <p>      Many <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> readers report that <strong>keeping      chickens, ducks or guineas reduces mosquitoes</strong>      because the birds are natural mosquito predators (see      "Poultry Pest Patrol Stories" under "Community" at      http://www.motherearthnews.com ).    </p>    <p>      According to the book CommonSense Pest Control, if you have      a small body of water with no natural outlet, you should      stock it with goldfish; mosquito fish ( <em>Gambusia      affinis</em> ), which often are available from      mosquito-control agencies; or native fish, many of which      are good mosquito predators, too.    </p>    <p>      Ponds populated with the right kinds of fish will work like      natural mosquito traps: Thanks to the hungry fish, neither      egg-laying female mosquitoes nor larvae will survive.    </p>    <p>      Another aspect of control is to <strong>protect natural      mosquito predators such as dragonflies, ants, ground      beetles, spiders, water striders, frogs and      snails.</strong> Avoid spraying broad-spectrum insecticides      that kill off many of these beneficial creatures.    </p>    <p>      Purple martins and bats are reported to have voracious      appetites for mosquitoes, too, but in fact, neither lives      up to their reputations. Studies of the contents of purple      martins' stomachs have concluded that mosquitoes are a      negligible item in these birds' diets, according to the      Purple Martin Conservation Association.    </p>    <p>      And urban entomologist Robert Corrigan of Richmond,      Indiana, says, "While standing outside of bat roosts      counting bats as part of my master's research, I was often      eaten alive by mosquitoes. They (the bats) weren't exactly      doing the job they're supposed to be famous for."    </p>    <p>      Both bats and martins, it turns out, prefer larger insects      such as beetles, moths, flies, wasps and bees, which give a      better return on their energy efforts.    </p>    <h3>      THE LURE OF TRAPS    </h3>        <p>      Numerous <strong>commercial mosquito traps</strong> are now      on the market. Most work by releasing small amounts of      carbon dioxide and/or octenol (1-Octen-3-ol), a substance      chemically similar to gases produced in the rumen of cows.      Mosquitoes lured by these gases are killed in sticky traps,      vacuums or electrocution grids.    </p>    <p>      The American Mosquito Control Association determined these      devices do lure and kill large numbers of some mosquitoes,      but some species, in some areas, remain unaffected.    </p>    <p>      The association also advises that some manufacturers'      claims of "acre-wide control" may be a bit overstated and      that placing such baited traps on your property could      attract mosquitoes that might not come otherwise. Priced      from $200 to $500 each, these traps are expensive enough      that you may want to ask for endorsements of their      effectiveness on local mosquito species before making the      investment.    </p>    <p>      It is, however, inexpensive and safe to stock up on      <strong>citronella candles.</strong> They contain      citronella oil made from tropical lemon-scented plants (      <em>Cymbopogon</em> , various species) that are native to      Asia, where this oil has long been used as an insect      repellent.    </p>    <p>      The candles have been shown to reduce mosquito bites by up      to 42 percent while being burned, according to a study done      by researcher Guy Surgeoner at the university of Guelph in      Ontario. New machines designed to release ,prays based on      citronella oil or geraniol, another plant-derived repellent      with a sweet, rosy odor, also are available.    </p>    <h3>      GROW YOUR OWN    </h3>    <p>      Some gardeners keep scented geraniums on their patios and      report that swishing their hands through the leaves makes      it possible to enjoy being Outdoors without suffering      mosquito bites. Art Tucker. research professor at Delaware      State University and coauthor of The Big Book of Herbs,      confirms that rose-scented geraniums <em>(Pelargonium x      asperum, sometimes sold as P. graveolens)</em> contain both      citronellal, which is similar to citronellal, and geraniol.      Rut, he says, the widely promoted 'Citrosa' geranium, which      is the so-called "Mosquito Plant," appears to contain only      small amounts of citronellal and is not likely to be any      more effective as a mosquito repellent than other rose      geraniums.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A better, less expensive choice for a homegrown      mosquito repellent may be lemon balm</strong> <em>(Melissa      officinalis)</em> . Tucker says lemon balm is easy to grow      from seeds and contains citronellal, geraniol and geranial.    </p>    <p>      Although lemon balm oil (called melissa oil) is hard to      find commercially, a strain of lemon balm plants with      higher essential oil content now is sold by some nurseries.      Two mail-order sources are Johnny's [(207) 8613)01;      <em>www.johnnyseeds.com</em> ]; and Richters [(905)      640-6677; <em>www.richters.com</em> ]. To use the balm as a      repellent, just crush a handful of the delicious-smelling      leaves in your hand and rub them on exposed skin.    </p>    <p>      Tucker's herbal repellent, can be mixed up at home, too. He      says his daughter reported success with it, especially      against ticks, when she was a ropes instructor at a camp on      Chesapeake Bay. She included myrrh.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Another good dooryard repellent plant could be      catnip</strong> . The American Chemical Society has      reported that researchers Chris Peterson and Joel Coats at      Iowa State University found nepetalactone, the essential      oil in catnip <em>(Nepeta cataria)</em> , to be about 10      times more effective at repelling mosquitoes than DEFT      <em>(N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide)</em> , the widely used      synthetic repellent. And James A. Duke, an authority on      herbal healing and author of The Green Pharmacy, reports      mountain mint <em>(Pycnanthemum muticum)</em> contains      enough pulegone, another powerful insect repellent, to make      it somewhat effective, too.    </p>    <p>      (A note of warning: Do not use mountain mint if you are      pregnant; the ingredient pulegone has been known to      increase the risk of miscarriage.)    </p>    <p>      Gardeners also report anecdotally that handfuls of basil      <em>(Ocimum basilicum)</em> ; lemon thyme (Thymus x      citriodorus); lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), which is      citronella's kissing cousin; and various other fragrant      herbs crushed and rubbed on the skin often repel mosquitoes      for short periods - usually less than 30 minutes.      (Always use any herb with caution until you know how your      skin will react.)    </p>    <h3>      OTHER STRATEGIES    </h3>    <p>      When it comes to treating your lawn, be careful not to kill      the natural enemies of mosquitoes, which definitely occurs      when you spray or "bomb" an area with broad-spectrum      insecticides. Many of these sprays contain one or more of a      group of insecticidal compounds known as pyrethrins.      Extremely toxic to bees, fish and other aquatic animals,      these chemicals also have been associated with      life-threatening allergic reactions in humans, and anemia      and disruption of sex hormones in lab animals. They will      kill both good and bad insects. Using them is even more      disruptive to the natural balance of outdoor life than      using electric bug zappers that attract bugs to a light      source and then electrocute them. (Numerous studies have      confirmed that zappers also kill many beneficial insects      and relatively few 'skeeters - unfortunately, less      than 2 percent of insects killed by bug zappers are the      biting female mosquitoes.)    </p>    <p>      But don't give up the fight for comfortable, safe outdoor      space. One good way to help shoo mosquitoes off your deck      or patio is to use a fan. Mosquitoes may be great smellers,      but they are weak fliers. If you often sit on an unscreened      porch, install an overhead ceiling fan: you'll be cooler      and have fewer bites.    </p>    <p>      You also can reduce your personal attractiveness to      mosquitoes. Avoid using highly perfumed soaps and shampoos,      wear loose-fitting clothing, which forms an air barrier      between you and the bugs, and use an herbal repellent.    </p>    <p>      The key to using any plant-based repellent is to watch how      it's working. Immediately after application, mosquitoes      will not light on your skin; as the effectiveness wanes,      they will light but not bite. That's your signal to go      inside or to apply more repellent because the third stage      is near - when the mosquitoes light and bite.    </p>    <p>      If mosquitoes are numerous, you may want to invest in      <strong>mosquito-net shirts,</strong> hoods or pants, and      you may want the protection of a chemical repellent, too.      Numerous studies show that products containing DEET are the      most effective for the longest time, usually more than four      hours.    </p>    <p>      Despite some reports of adverse reactions, the CDC      considers DEET to be safe when products containing it are      used according to label directions. For a child, apply only      repellents with 10 percent or less concentrations of DEET,      and don't put the repellent on the child's hands. For      adults, research shows that products with no more than 35      percent DEET are as effective as those with higher      concentrations.    </p>    <p>      The best idea might be to keep a bottle of DEET-based      repellent on hand for emergencies only, such as hiking in a      swamp or at sundown in the middle of summer, and rely on      plant-based repellents for everyday use. In a 2002 study      conducted at the University of Florida's Medical Entomology      Laboratory, <em>three plant-based repellents were found to      be effective for at least an hour</em> . These were Bite      Blocker, which contains soy, coconut and geranium oils (and      which now has had citric acid added and is called Bite      Blocker Herbal Spray), Repel's Lemon Eucalyptus and Fite      Bite Lemon Eucalyptus, both lemon eucalyptus-based lotions.      <em>(The study found citronella products, Avon Skin So Soft      and wristbands laced with DEET provided protection for only      20 minutes or less.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Barbara Pleasant, a regular contributor to MOTHER EARTH      NEWS, is the author of The Gardener's Bug Book. Her most      recent book, Garden Stone, received the Garden Globe award      from the Garden Writers of America.</em>    </p>    <h3>      <em>How Mosquitoes Live</em>    </h3>    <p>      North America is home to more than 170 species of mosquito,      which vary in size, geographic distribution and behavior.      They all need to lay their eggs in standing water (either      fresh, salt or brackish). Larvae hatch in two to three days      - or two to three months if the weather is not right.      The larvae, called wrigglers, feed in the water for a week      or so, then pupate for only a few days before emerging as      adults.    </p>    <p>      Male adult mosquitoes feed mostly on flower nectar and do      not bite humans, but female mosquitoes require high-protein      blood meals to produce eggs. In a single feeding, a female      mosquito doubles her weight, and she's usually ready to      feed again in three to four days. Species vary in their      preferred times to feed; many feed from twilight into the      night, while others are active during the day. Some species      prefer to dine on the blood of birds or other animals,      while some, called anthropophilic mosquitoes, like humans      best. The wiliest species switch around with the seasons,      seeking out humans when they can find them, and settling      for other animals when people are scarce.    </p>    <p>      To attract a mosquito, simply exhale. In doing so, you      breathe more than 100 volatile compounds into the air;      simultaneously, your skin releases another 100 or so,      including some that mosquitoes pick up with chemoreceptors      on their antennae. Following your gaseous plume, mosquitoes      move in, where they are attracted more intensely by the      warmth and moisture of your body. Then comes the bite.    </p>    <p>      If you think you are being bitten while your companion is      not, you may be right: Some people attract more mosquitoes      than others, according to Iowa State University      entomologist John VanDyk.    </p>    <h3>      Herbal Insect Repellent    </h3>        <p>      <em>2 1/2, teaspoons total of any combination of the      following essential oils (available at health food stores):      basil, cedarwood, citronella, juniper, lemon, myrrh,      palmarosa, pine, rose geranium and/or rosemary</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup 190-proof grain alcohol (available in liquor      stores)</em>    </p>    <p>      Place ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and      shake vigorously. Transfer to small bottles for storage. To      use, rub a small amount on any exposed skin (test first to      be sure your skin will not be adversely affected by the      repellent) or dab it on clothing.    </p>    <p>      Experiment a little to find which essential oils work best      with your body chemistry. If you're lucky, you also will      like the way they smell; otherwise, add a few drops of      peppermint oil to fine-tune the fragrance.    </p>    <h3>      If you are bitten...    </h3>        <p>      You probably won't need to plant this home remedy because      it is a very common weed, often growing in compacted soil      along sidewalks and driveways. To use the plant as first      aid for a mosquito bite, crush a few leaves and rub them on      the bite.    </p>    <p>      Some anti-itch drugstore medicines to use include Calamine      lotion or cortisone creams. Doctors generally recommend      pain relievers, ice packs and meat tenderizer to treat      insect bites and stings. Promptly applying a dab of      commercial meat tenderizer directly to a sting can      neutralize the allergen.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Adapted from</em> <em><br />      The Green Pharmacy by James Duke, Ph.D.</em>    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
