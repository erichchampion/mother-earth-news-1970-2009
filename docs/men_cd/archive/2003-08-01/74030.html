                    <h3><em>Start this cold-hardy crop now for sweet soups and    salads this winter.</em> </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      by John Navazio    </h5>        <p>      Count kale as one of the true treasures of the fall garden,      with its sweetness revealed only after old Jack Frost has      kissed its leaves a time or two. This ultra-cold-hardy,      leafy green vegetable is a reliable deeply satisfying      addition to any cool-weather garden. Some types have tender      leaves perfect for salads. Some are great steamed or in      stews, and some are so hardy you can harvest them even in      the dead of winter almost everywhere. And, they're      beautiful, too.    </p>    <p>      Many of the folks who buy their produce in season from      local farmers have learned to love this unusual,      old-fashioned fall and winter vegetable - even though      they may not have grown up eating it. Kale is a      little-known relative of broccoli and cabbage, with a taste      that appeals to both adults and children. During my years      as a kale lover, I've run into a number of kale-eating      families with young children who relish the vegetable      steamed and served simply with butter or perhaps vinegar,      with salt and pepper to taste. Deb Kaldahl of the Abundant      Life Seed Foundation in Pots Townsend, Washington, says      steamed kale is one of the few cooked vegetables her      children will eat.    </p>    <p>      An elite member of a highly nutritious family of foods      called the "dark-green leafy vegetables," kale is kin to      broccoli and collards, which are its closest relatives;      spinach: Swiss chard; and beet, mustard and turnip greens.      All are good sources of vitamin K, the B-vitamin folic      acid, and betas carotene, which is converted to vitamin A      in the liver. Darkgreen leafy vegetables also are      exceptionally. high in other carotenoids, including      zeaxanthin and lutein, which are powerful antioxidants that      protect us from degenerative illnesses like cancer,      cardio-vascular disease and age-related macular      degeneration (the leading cause of blindness among the      elderly).    </p>    <p>      For years, kale also has been touted as one of the best      vegetable sources of calcium - which is especially      important for vegans and others who don't consume dairy      products. The newest research on calcium's role in human      nutrition sheds even snore light of how important kale,      collards and broccoli can he: It shows that, in order for      the body to assimilate dietary calcium, magnesium also must      be present in a meal. Dairy products are rich in calcium      but have relatively little magnesium kale and its relatives      have substantial amounts of both nutrients.    </p>    <h3>      THE TALE OF TWO KALES    </h3>        <p>      Kale thrives in cold weather and has a venerable history of      nourishing people in the cold, dark months of the year,      when few other green vegetables are to be had. The most      common kale, the so-called Scotch or Scotch Curled      <em>(Brassica oleracea, Acephala group),</em> is a      primitive cabbage.    </p>    <p>      The other kind of kale, the Siberian or Napus type      <em>(Brassica napus)</em> , actually is more closely      related to rutabagas. With its tender leaves, it has become      popular in recent years as an ingredient in many of the      imaginative salad mixes being grown by home gardeners and      market farmers. Thanks to the introduction of new colors      and forms in the last few years, an excellent selection of      both the Scotch Curled and Napus types are available      commercially.    </p>    <p>      Kale is most often grown north of the Mason-Dixon Line;      Scotch kale's botanical sister, collards, fills the same      dietary niche in the South. This is due, in part, to the      fact that collards taste better than kale in warm Southern      summers. In fact, both greens benefit from cold      temperatures that turn starches to sugars in their stems      and leaves; with kale, the kind of cold that seems to      really transport it from mediocre to divine is several      nights of 20-degree temperatures. That means it can be a      great winter crop for the South, where a few frosty nights      can bring out its flavor peak by midwinter.    </p>    <p>      Over the years I've heard many claims as to just how cold      hardy kale can be. To find out which kale could best stand      up to the vagaries of short fall days and cold conditions,      I enlisted the help of several kale connoisseurs from      across the country: gardener and photographer David      Cavagnaro in Decorah, Iowa; plant breeder and seed grower      Frank Morton of Wild Garden Seed in Philomath, Oregon; and      Micaela Colley, farm manager at Seeds of Change in Santa      Fe, New Mexico. We also had a test site for a cold showdown      in Maine, where kale often can be counted on until      Christmas, but an early, very cold fall laid the crop to      waste before we could get any results.    </p>    <p>      To find which varieties we could rely on for flavor,      productivity and cold-hardiness in our respective parts of      the country, we selected eight to test - five Scotch      Curled and three Napus types, all held in high regard by      kale lovers. The Scotch Curled types included a couple of      reliable old workhorses, 'Vates Blue' (sometimes listed as      'Dwarf Blue Vates') and 'Winterbor,' as well as two      varieties relatively new to the U.S. gardening scene: the      striking, bright-red 'Redbor' hybrid and the Italian      heirloom 'Lacinato' For 'Lacinato' (sometimes called black      kale because the leaves are such a dark green), we used an      Americanized selection and its Italian counterpart, 'Nero      Di Toscana.' From the Napus group, we tried the beautiful      'White Russian,' 'Red Ursa' and the feisty, cold-hardy      'Winter Red,' which was reported to be more resistant to      cold than its progenitor, 'Russian Red.'    </p>    <h3>      RESULTS OF THE TRIALS    </h3>        <p>      Recognizing that kale's flavor doesn't really develop until      the first fall cold snap, many experienced growers wait      until July to sow the seeds in flats for late July      transplanting to the field or garden. We had ours planted      out by July 10, and by late September, all three plots were      producing enough for the testers to start harvesting,      assessing and enjoying.    </p>    <p>      By this time of year, testers could tell why the Scotch      Curled types retain such a loyal following. As a cooked      vegetable alone or in soups and stews, <strong>this kale      offers a sweet, full-bodied flavor.</strong> Cavagnaro, an      independent spirit, stood alone in his disdain for the      Scotch Curled kales. "I don't like working with the      `'potscrubber' kales in the kitchen," he says. "I like the      broader, smoother leaves of the Russian or Napus types."      (He is, however, fond of Scotch Curled kale when it's      transformed into "Krispy Kale," a snack created by Kim      Blanchard of Rock Spring Farm in Highlandville, Iowa.      Here's how to make it: Stem one bunch fresh kale and chop      into 2-inch pieces. Toss with olive oil and salt, and place      on a jellyroll pan. Crisp in a 375-degree oven for about 10      minutes. We tried it here at MOTHER and it was delicious!)    </p>    <p>      In keeping with their identity as salad greens, the Napus      types were faster growing and more robust than the Scotch      Curled types, which grew more slowly and deliberately.      <strong>For vigor and ability to produce a steady harvest,      the Napus variety `White Russian' was tops, followed by      another Napus, `Winter Red.'</strong>    </p>    <p>      The third variety to really shine in terms of productivity,      though, was the Scotch Curled type Winterbor,' which even      edged out `White Russian' and `Winter Red' in the harsh      mountain climate at the Seeds of Change farm. Also showing      respectable yields in this category was 'Lacinato,' which      did significantly better than its Italian look-alike, 'Nero      Di Toscana.' `Vates' also had a good showing for yield.    </p>        <p>      In the end, cold temperatures proved the great equalizer      between the two types of kale. In Oregon, for example, a      sudden, unusually frigid blast of cold, dry weather sent      temperatures plummeting on three consecutive nights to 24,      then 20 and 15 degrees - the coldest readings all      winter. "That definitely hurt the Napus types here," says      Morton, who watched as the 'Red Ursa' and then the `Winter      Red' got pretty badly beaten up. His `White Russian' only      sustained moderate damage; the Winterbor' and especially      the `Vates' held their own.    </p>    <p>      At Cavagnaro's in Iowa, two weeks of cold, mid-November      nights with temperatures dipping into the teens seriously      damaged his kales by Thanksgiving Day, when the morning low      hit 14 degrees. 'Vates' was the clear winner with the least      amount of frost damage, while Winterbor' came in a close      second. A big surprise un der these conditions was how well      `White Russian' held up, still retaining a number of its      youngest leaves in a harvestable state despite the cold.    </p>    <p>      Colley's New Mexico plots, with cold, dry winter weather at      5,000 feet in the Rockies, yielded similar results, with      <strong>`Vates,' Winterbor' and `White Russian' topping the      field. According to Colley, `Vates' is the most reliable      variety for living straight through the winter</strong> in      New Mexico. In all three locations, 'Lacinato proved      significantly more cold-hardy than 'Nero Di Toscana.'    </p>    <h3>      FLAVOR'S THE THING    </h3>    <p>      When it comes to kale flavor, which should be sweet and      robust, folks who know their kales are quite passionate      about their favorites. Anyone who has had the good fortune      of dining on high quality, cold-weather kale from market      farmers probably has tasted `Winterbor,' the standard for      20 years. It is so delicious, it sets the bar.    </p>    <p>      `Vates,' in our taste tests, seems quite comparable to      `Winterbor,' but `Redbor,' despite its brilliant red color      and market appeal, fell sadly short.    </p>    <p>      The best bet for improving kale's popularity among those      yet unacquainted with its charms appears to be 'Lacinato,'      however. Morton (shown in photo at right), with his years      of experience growing and selling kales, says of this old      Italian variety now gaining popularity in the United      States, "It is not the most productive, the most cold hardy      or the most uniform, but <strong>'Lacinato' is the most      sought-after by customers</strong> <strong>-</strong>      and by the farm crew, too."    </p>    <p>      If you want kale for cool-weather salads, try the beautiful      `White Russian' (available from seed sources 1 and 7, at      right) or `Winter Red' (7). If you live where it gets cold      and you want to stretch your season, be sure to grow      `Winterbor' F1 (3, 4, 5, 7) and `Vates' (2, 3). If you love      the flavor of cooked kale, be sure to try 'Lacinato' (1 and      6). If you're really adventurous, try a little of each and      enjoy kale throughout the year!    </p>    <p>      John Navazio, Ph.D., is director of seed grower development      at the Abundant Life Seed Foundation in Port Townsend,      Washington, and owner of the organic seed company, Seed      Movement, in Bellingham, Washington.    </p>    <h3>      Grow Your Own Kale    </h3>        <p>      Experienced kale growers, knowing the crop's preference for      cool weather, sow seeds of their favorite varieties in      flats in midsummer for late-midsummer transplanting to the      garden. It's often too hot at that time of year to start      seeds in a greenhouse, so try the trick of starting them in      the partial shade of large trees. Be sure to keep the flats      well watered.    </p>    <p>      For transplanting, choose a sunny, fertile spot with lots      of compost in the soil. If possible, plant your kale on a      high spot that is well-drained but still out of the wind.      This will help to extend the bounty of the crop into the      winter time. Space the seedlings 14 inches apart in all      directions, or 12 inches apart in rows 2 feet apart.    </p>    <p>      Aphids can get established early and persist on your kale      if you don't have enough insect predators in the vicinity      of your garden. Ned Herbert, farm manager of the Abundant      Life Seed Foundation, says he tries to always have      flowering members of the Umbel family, which includes dill,      coriander and bronze fennel, in the garden to attract      parasitic wasps that prey on aphids.    </p>    <p>      You also can remove aphids with a strong spray from your      hose. As for cabbageworms, the easiest organic answer is to      spray <strong>Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).</strong> Be sure      to use the version of Bt that is labeled for caterpillars.      Plants mature for harvest in 50 to 80 days. To freeze your      bounty, treat it just like spinach: Blanch in boiling      water, plunge into iced water to stop the cooking, package      in freezer bags and label.    </p>    <p>      <strong>1.
