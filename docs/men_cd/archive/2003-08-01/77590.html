They found      broccoli, cauliflower, table grapes, green peas, spinach      and lettuce all traveled more than 2,000 miles from farm to      market; only pumpkins and mushrooms traveled less than 500      miles.

The label aims to assure consumers that      the meat, poultry, egg or dairy products to which it is      affixed come from facilities that meet precise, objective,      humane standards. To learn which products carry the label,      visit the Web site at www.certifiedhumane.com .    </p>    <p>      <strong>Body Burden.</strong> Researchers found a average      of 91 industrial compounds, pollutants and other chemicals      in the blood and urine of nine volunteers sampled, and      identified a total of 167 different chemicals overall.      Seventy-six of the 167 chemicals identified cause cancer in      humans or animals, 94 are toxic to the brain and nervous      system and 79 cause birth defects or abnormal development.      <em>(SOURCE: STUDY LED BY MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN      NEW YORK, WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND      COMMONWEALTH: WWW.EWG.ORG/REPORTS<br />      /BODYBURDEN )</em>    </p></div>    <h3>      Frankenfish Food Fight    </h3>    <p>      Salmon genetically modified to grow faster are the newest      battleground in the bioengineered food debate. The      altered-fish controversy joins continuing concerns about      the food safety, environmental risks and economic fallout      of genetically modified (GM) corn, soy and rapeseed crops,      and GM growth hormones used in dairy cattle.    </p>    <p>      Legislation to control the transport and labeling of GM      salmon enjoys strong support from consumer, environmental      and commercial fishing groups.    </p>    <p>      The transgenic salmon contain genes from the ocean pout      fish and Chinook salmon and grow seven times faster than      natural wild salmon. The GM males are more attractive to      wild female salmon, leading to concerns that this modified      species will outcompete and cause the extinction of smaller      wild salmon species. <em>(SOURCE: SAN FRANCISCO      CHRONICLE)</em>    </p>    <h3>      Java, with GMOs on the Side    </h3>    <p>      The coffee giant Starbucks is the target of a Fair Trade/No      GMOs Campaign by the Organic Consumers Association (OCA).      The effort is designed to get Starbucks to serve and      promote Fair Trade coffee and to remove genetically      engineered ingredients from their food and dairy products.    </p>    <p>      Activists protested outside the company's Seattle      headquarters during the 2003 annual shareholders meeting,      and OCA has a "Send a Free Fax to Starbucks' CEO" offer on      its Web site, www.organicconsumers.org/starbucks/.    </p>    <h3>      Future Farm Food Folly    </h3>    <p>      Genetically engineered crops and genetically modified      organisms (GMOs) are threatening the future of organic      farming. The fourth National Organic Farmers Survey      documents early impacts GMOs are having on certified      organic farming. Forty-six percent of the survey's 1,034      respondents rated the risk of exposure and possible      contamination of their organic farm products by GMOs as      "moderate or greater," with 30 percent of the 46 percent      ranking that risk "high or very high."    </p>    <p>      Survey respondents identified contaminated seed stock (see      story at right) as their primary concern, followed by GMO      pollen drift in the field and contaminated inputs other      than seed, including seed inoculants, manures or composts      from materials obtained off the farm.    </p>    <p>      The survey results were released in May at an Organic Trade      Association conference. For more information, visit      <em>www.ofrf.org.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Genetic Drift and the fate of your Dinner Plate    </h3>        <p>      As public awareness of the controversies surrounding      genetically modified (GM) crops grows, the ability to      choose whether or not to eat gene-altered food is quickly      diminishing.    </p>    <p>      The reasons are twofold: First, many GM crop plants and      farm fields are not closed units. They naturally spread      their GM traits and "contaminate" other plants and farm      fields. This happens through pollen carried by wind or      insects, or by GM seed that falls onto non-GM fields from      passing trucks or from farm equipment previously used on a      transgenic field.    </p>    <p>      Second, because thus far the government is treating      bioengineered food crops the same as crops produced through      conventional breeding, there's been little attempt to      segregate them in commodity grain channels or to keep      transgenic varieties from contaminating the nation's      primary seed stocks.    </p>    <p>      Walter Fehr, an agronomist and director of the Office of      Biotechnology at Iowa State University, says GM varieties      of staple crops like corn and soybeans may have      contaminated seed stocks from breeder seed on down. Breeder      seed is supposed to be the purest version of a crop      variety. All the seed for any given variety comes from      breeder seed, and if it contains transgenic material,      everything that descends from it will, too.    </p>    <p>      Comprehensive research to determine the extent of      transgenic contamination in public seed stocks hasn't been      done. But, Fehr says, incidents of transgenic contamination      of seed stocks have occurred.    </p>    <p>      Certified organic food is supposed to be 100 percent      GM-free. But now both organic and conventional farmers who      don't want biotech varieties can no longer trust their      seed. Transgenic contamination is so rampant that seed      suppliers won't guarantee their seed is GM-free. That, plus      concerns about contamination through pollen drift have      stopped many organic farmers in the Midwest from growing      corn, soybean and rapeseed crops.    </p>    <p>      In April 2002, Western Producer, a Canadian agricultural      newspaper, quoted one biotech industry supporter who said      that despite rising public opposition to biotech foods,      increasing GM acreage may eventually end the debate. "It's      a hell of a thing to say that the way we win is to not give      the consumer a choice, but that might be it," said Dale      Adolphe, executive director of the Canadian Seed Growers      Association.    </p>    <p>      So far, only four crops - corn, soybeans, rapeseed      and cotton - account for most of the biotech crops on      the market. But GM contamination issues are about to get      much more dangerous as food crops are being engineered to      produce pharmaceutical drugs and industrial chemicals.    </p>    <p>      Citizens need to weigh in on the biotech food debate,      before there is no choice. In the United Kingdom, a      national, government-sponsored public debate got under way      in June.

The hope was to avoid another      Mad Cow disaster like the one that hit Europe in the      mid-1980s and 90s. In England, the epicenter of that      outbreak, 100,000 cases were confirmed by 1993. 5 million      cattle were slaughtered and dozens of people died of the      deadly human form of the disease which is thought to be      contracted from eating tainted meat.    </p>    <p>      At the Canadian slaughterhouse, the infected cow's head was      saved for testing, but the rest of the carcass went to a      rendering plant that makes fertilizers and feeds. After the      Mad Cow diagnosis arrived from a British lab, Canadian      officials began trying to trace the animals history and      determine what exactly had happened to its remains. The      incubation period of this disease ranges from to 8 years,      so the investigators faced a difficult task.    </p>    <p>      For starters, the rest in the 150-Cow herd on the Alberta      farm from which the cow carne were quarantined, slaughtered      and tested. And four days after the initial announcement 13      farms in three provinces - Saskatchewan and British      Columbia in addition to Alberta - were quarantined as      investigators focused on the possible use of the cow's      retrains in livestock feed. Then, Albertas Agriculture      Minister reported her concern that the sick cow may have      been infected by eating feed containing the protein of      other infected cows or sheep, a practice banned in 1997 in      Canada but not well policed.    </p>    <p>      The feeding of ruminant meat and bone meal to other      ruminants had been a common practice in many countries      until British experts determined that as the cause of BSI:      infection in cattle. Some countries now ban the practice;      others, including the United States, have set some      restrictions. <em>(SOURCE.

After years of research, biopower from two      unlikely crops - willow and switchgrass - soon      may be a reality in New York and Iowa.    </p>    <p>      Near Niagara Falls, New York, the Niagara Mohawk Power      Co.'s Dunkirk Station is involved in a project that centers      on 500 acres planted with a specially developed species of      willow. When topped back to 4 inches, the trees produce      numerous suckers that can be harvested every three to four      years, cut into chips and burned alongside coal to produce      electricity.    </p>    <p>      In southern Iowa, the 8-year-old Chariton Valley Biomass      Project has a similar effort underway using switchgrass, a      native perennial grass of the Great Plains. Several      thousand tons of baled switchgrass are stockpiled for      testing near Alliant Energy's Ottumwa Generating Station,      where, if all goes well, the grass will replace a portion      of the coal normally burned there. <strong>These two      projects make up North America's largest investment to date      in technologies that convert crop plants into      power.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Both programs have faced practical challenges, from      developing high-yielding varieties to solving staffing and      machinery problems at the power plants. Fortunately, both      projects are backed by consortiums of talented minds,      including plant breeders, industrial engineers, land-use      experts, foresters and the ultimate experts in growing and      harvesting crops: farmers.    </p>    <p>      Because biomass fuels are bulky, emphasis is placed on      producing them close to the power plants to reduce      transportation costs. "Our plans include using switchgrass      grown within 70 miles of the power plant," says Dora      Guffey, coordinator of Chariton Valley Resource      Conservation and Development, which operates the southern      Iowa biomass project.    </p>    <p>      In New York, project staffers have found that even with      transportation costs figured in, properly grown willow      yields 16 to 32 units of energy for every unit of energy      invested in its production and conversion. To get such      numbers, a good biomass crop must require little in terms      of fertilizer, water and labor.    </p>    <p>      Environmental integrity also is part of the package. Much      of the acreage involved in willow and switchgrass      production already is enrolled in the U.S. Department of      Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which      aims to help protect environmentally sensitive land from      degradation. Both willow and switchgrass have received high      ratings as wildlife habitat and windbreaks and for erosion      control. In New York, the project staff found the willow      plantings hosted such robust communities of soil      microorganisms and songbirds that they qualified as      "refugee corridors" for displaced species in an otherwise      agricultural area; in Iowa, harvested switchgrass proved a      preferred habitat for such grassland birds as meadowlarks      and bobolinks. Yet money issues remain; biopower still      costs more than coal, but as coal and other fossil fuels      dwindle, biopower is expected to gain value. <em>For more      information on these programs, visit the Biopower Web site:      <a href="http://www.eren.doe.gov/biopower" target="_blank">www.eren.doe.gov/biopower</a> . - Barbara Pleasant.</em>    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
