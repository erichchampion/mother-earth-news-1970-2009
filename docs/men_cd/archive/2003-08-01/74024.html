                    <h3>Water Wonder </h3>        <p>      Moving water makes a great addition to any bird feeding      station, often attracting birds that do not eat the various      seeds normally offered. Even a small drip of water will      attract many birds. You can make this dripper device for      about $20, using the materials listed below.    </p>    <p>      Build your tower of couplings from large to small. Wrap the      threads with Teflon tape and then snug them up tight for a      leakproof set of reducing couplings that connects the end      of your garden hose to the inch copper tubing.    </p>    <p>      Next, choose how you want to shape your tubing. The unit      pictured has a spiral twist, first bent around a big tin      can, then a smaller one and then an even smaller one for      smooth curves. Don't bend your tubing too close to the      compression fitting, as this can cause cracking.    </p>    <p>      Position the dripper just above any broad, shallow dish      that will hold water. Ours is a concrete birdbath, placed      on a log that fits right into our naturalized setting.    </p>    <p>      A large screw eye, carefully pried open and then closed      around your reducing couplings and screwed into a stake      will anchor the system. The "Y" connector attaches to the      faucet so other hoses can be used. In order to conserve      water, we don't run the dripper all the time.    </p>    <p>      We do fill the birdbath once a day to keep it fresh. When      we have company or on days off, we let it trickle so we can      enjoy the extra activity it brings to the bird area.      Robins, hummingbirds, catbirds, thrushes and even a grouse      or two, usually not attracted by seed feeders, are drawn to      this water in our backyard garden.    </p>    <p>      <em>STEVE ANDERSON<br />      Burnham, Maine</em>    </p>    		<h3>MATERIALS LIST</h3>    <p>      3 feet of 1/4-inch copper tubing<br />      Double (Y) hose connector<br />      3 brass reducing bushings<br />      1/4-inch compression fitting<br />      Swivel hose connector<br />      Large screw eye<br />      Teflon tape    </p>    <h3>      Salad Spinner    </h3>    <p>      As an avid gardener and salad eater, I have always loved my      salad spinner. Now I use it for all kinds of things besides      salad. For example, I use it to spin-dry herbs after I've      washed them. I find my pesto tastes better if the basil      leaves are dry before I process them with olive oil. This      summer I used the spinner when I froze surplus vegetables      from the garden. After blanching, vegetables are usually      soaked in ice water to cool then down quickly, then patted      dry with paper towels or dish towels, and finally packed      into plastic storage bags. When I process vegetables, I use      my salad spinner to spin the vegetables dry. This cuts down      on paper towel use (expensive, wastes trees.) Plus, it's      much faster!    </p>    <p>      <em>ERIKA JENSEN<br />      Prairie Farm, Wisconsin</em>    </p>    <h3>      Freezer Disks    </h3>    <p>      Instead of freezing chicken or beef stock in a large      container, I pour it into a wide, shallow bowl, until its      about an inch deep, and then pop it into the freezer. Once      it's frozen, I remove the resulting disc from the bowl and      slip it into a plastic freezer bag. These discs take up      less room in the freezer and fit nicely into a soup pot      where they are quickly thawed and ready to use.    </p>    <p>      <em>GRACE BROCKWAY<br />      Chazy Lake, New York</em>    </p>    <h3>      Outdoor Mini-Oven    </h3>    <p>      I live in Grants Pass, Oregon, and it gets pretty hot here      in the summer - too hot for cooking indoors. When my      kids have a sweet tooth, I build a box oven outdoors for      making cookies. It also works great for making pies,      casseroles and stews. Here's how to make one:    </p>    <p>      Find a cardboard box about 20 inches by 20 inches by 14      inches, four empty cans from corn or beans, some charcoal      and a few stones. Outside, on a dirt surface or on cement,      and away from any flammables, arrange the cans in a square      about 5 or 6 inches apart. On the ground, in the center of      the cans, put five or six charcoal briquettes and light      them. Wait until the charcoal is ashy-looking, which means      it is ready to cook on. Put your cookie sheet or casserole      on the cans and put the box over the top of it all. Use      little stones to raise the box edges about an inch, to      control the heat and to allow for ventilation. Adjust the      temperature with the stones - just experiment and      have fun. This works. It also is great to use when camping      or in case of a power outage. It even works in the snow!    </p>    <p>      <em>MARLA MACPHERSON<br />      Merlin, Oregon</em>    </p>    <h3>      Skin Smoothie    </h3>    <p>      I have been a subscriber for more than 20 years. My MOTHER      EARTH NEWS magazines will be passed down to my daughter.      here is an old recipe for a wonderful facial treatment:    </p>    <p>      1 tablespoon dry skim milk<br />      1 fresh egg white<br />      1/2 teaspoon honey    </p>    <p>      Whip ingredients together until smooth. Apply thickly over      your face and throat. Do not rub the cream in; just smooth      it over your skin as if you were frosting a cake. Leave the      mixture on for 15 minutes, then rinse it off with cold      water. Finish your facial treatment with your favorite      moisturizer.    </p>    <p>      <em>RHONDA FEATHERINGILL<br />      Palmyra, Indiana</em>    </p>    <h3>      Sapling Screens    </h3>    <p>      You can make a privacy fence from saplings that      need thinning.    </p>        <p>      <em>RICHARD GAMBIER<br />      Bainbridge, New York</em>    </p>    <h3>      Credit Card Capers    </h3>    <p>      Ever think you could put "plastic" (credit cards) to better      use? Recycle them for use as pan scrapers. They're      flexible, tough and safely chisel away stuck or burned food      from your pots and pan. I think they often do a better job      than the plastic pan scrapers that you buy and then throw      away.    </p>    <p>      <em>CHARLES SWISHER<br />      Oxford, Pennsylvania</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>They remove windshield frost pretty well, too. -      MOTHER</em>    </p>    <h3>      Practical Potting Bench    </h3>    <p>      An old ironing board makes a nifty, storable, portable      potting bench.    </p>    <p>      <em>ANNA VICTORIA REICH<br />      Albuquerque, New Mexico</em>    </p>    <h3>      Homemade Liquid Soap    </h3>    <p>      Love liquid soap but hate paying the exorbitant prices? Or      maybe you can't stand the perfumes they use? Make your own      Using scrap from your favorite soap.    </p>    <p>      Just save a few pump dispensers from shampoo or hand      lotion. At the same time save the scrap of soap left after      you use a bar. When you have enough saved, put the soap      scrap into a clean, glass jar or bowl, and add boiling      water to cover. Let this sit until it ha, cooled. Then stir      it with a fork, mashing the lumps. Add an inch or so of      boiling water, stir well and let cool. When you stir, it      should be reasonably smooth but a little stringy. Add water      and stir until it is the right consistency, then fill your      bottles. Leave some space in case you want to add more      water: it sets up a little in the bottle.    </p>    <p>      <em>JEANETTE HANBERRY<br />      Anderson, South Carolina</em>    </p>    <h3>      In Hot Water    </h3>    <p>      The next time you need to wash your tiled or      linoleum-covered kitchen floor, try this tip: Before you      grab your mob. grab your tea kettle. That's right.    </p>    <p>      Water is universal solvent and, once heated, it does a      great job of loosening most of the food-based grime on a      kitchen floor. Pour a little bit of boiling water on the      dirtiest spots on your floor. Let it stand for a few      minutes. I use this method and then mop with just hot tap      water mixed with dishwashing detergent. When I'm done, the      floor looks spotless, the kitchen doesn't stink of      chemicals and I haven't spent money on expensive cleaners.      This method is good for the environment.    </p>    <p>      <em>HEIDI M. DOUGLASS<br />      Berkley, Massachusetts</em>    </p>    <h3>      Cordwood Cover    </h3>        <p>      I am a longtime subscriber to M OTHER E ARTH N EWS . I      always look forward to each new issue and devour it cover      to cover. In western Washington state, it often is too wet      for wood to season in the open air, so here's my tip:    </p>    <p>      To build a cordwood rack, I used two pallets, some 2-by-4s,      some scrap lumber and three 1/2-inch by 10-foot plastic      pipes to build a drying rack. After filling the rack, I      attached the plastic pipes as shown and covered the rack      loosely with a tarp to allow next year's firewood to dry.    </p>    <p>      <em>NATHANIEL NELSON<br />      Yelm, Washington</em>    </p>    <h3>      Quilting Quickie    </h3>        <p>      I recycle gallon plastic jugs into quilting templates that      last practically forever. I use the almost square ones,      like milk and water are bottled in. Cut the flat sides from      the jugs and lay them on the pattern. Use a ruler and      fine-tip permanent marker to trace the pattern onto the      plas tic. Cut out the pieces and save them in small plastic      bags labeled with the name of the quilt pattern; also      include a small diagram of the finished block. This way you      can have dozens of quilting templates at almost no cost.    </p>    <p>      <em>MARCELLA WHITE<br />      Edmonton, Kentucky</em>    </p><hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
