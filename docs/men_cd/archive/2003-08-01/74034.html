                    <h5 id="byline">      by Barbara Pleasant    </h5>        <p>      <em>Cilantro (Coriandrum sativum) is really two herbs in      one. The leaves, called cilantro or Chinese parsley, impart      a musky, citrus-like (some even say "soapy") flavor to      Mexican, Chinese and Thai cooking. The tiny, round seeds,      called coriander, taste of sage and lemon or orange peel,      and season many traditional Indian dishes, especially      curries.</em>    </p>    <p>      Coriander roots also have culinary use. In Southeast Asia,      they are dug, chopped and added to salty pickled condiments      by many kitchen gardeners.    </p>    <p>      This easy-to-grow herb is rich in vitamins A and C, and      also contains iron and calcium. In the garden, coriander      flowers attract beneficial insects. At the flowering and      fruit-set stage, the plants give off a slightly acrid      smell, which is probably why this herb's botanical name is      derived from the Greek word for bedbug, which emits a      similar color. In mature seeds, this odor vanishes.    </p>    <p>      Some people find the unique smell and taste of fresh      cilantro unpleasant, but those of this opinion are      definitely in the minority because the herb's popularity      has skyrocketed in recent years. Cilantro enthusiasts      eagerly eat the leaves raw, chopped into salsas or salads,      and layered onto sandwiches.    </p>    <p>      Cilantro is essential in Pad Thai - Thailand's      best-known noodle dish - a delicious, spicy-sweet mix      of rice noodles, tofu, shrimp or chicken, and eggs,      flavored with fish sauce, garlic, chilies and ginger (in      addition to cilantro), and topped with peanuts. When used      as a topping for rice noodles or in Oriental clipping      sauces, cilantro and roasted peanuts often are chopped      together.    </p>    <p>      Down Mexico way, cilantro always brings salsa to life,      whether it's tomato haled, with avocados and beans, or      fruit-based, using peaches, mangoes or even apples. For      tamer palates, a bit of minced cilantro mixed into equal      parts of butter and cream cheese makes a wonderful herb      spread. Minced leaves stirred into sour cream make a      refreshing accent for chili or other spicy soups. Add      cilantro to cooked dishes, such as rice pilafs Or beans, at      the last minute, to preserve its color and flavor.    </p>    <p>      Coriander seeds, on the ocher hand, respond well to heat.      When cooking with them, roast the seeds first in a warm,      dry pan until you can smell their nutty aroma; the roasting      only takes a few minutes but it produces an absolutely      divine scent. Then, coarsely grind or chop the roasted      seeds with a heavy knife, or mortar and pestle. A few      crushed coriander seeds make a welcome addition to any      curry dish, and provide an ideal accompaniment to lentils,      rice, mushrooms, tomatoes and many ether vegetables. Left      whole and coated with sugar rather than roasted, the seeds      make a dessert-type treat called coriander comfit.    </p>    <p>      Cilantro grows easily from seeds, or you can buy bunches of      fresh cilantro and jars of dried coriander seeds in the      produce and spice sections of most supermarkets. Cut stems      of cilantro will keep in the refrigerator for several days      in a plastic bag (clip the stem ends off and set the sprigs      in a glass of water before you slip on the plastic bag).      You also can freeze leaves that have been rinsed and patted      dry. When frozen, cilantro leaves retain much of their      flavor; when dried, leaves lose flavor. Store dry coriander      seeds whole, in an airtight container, in a cool, dark      place; they will keep for more than a year.    </p>    <h3>      GROW YOUR OWN    </h3>        <p>      A fast-growing annual, cilantro thrives in cool weather.      You will find seeds widely available on retail seed racks      and in mail-order catalogs. Among named varieties, `Santo'      is a little slower to bolt than the species (wild)      cilantro, and `Festival' and Janta' have large leaves that      help them grow quickly to a mature size. When sown in the      fall, established plants of any variety often survive      winter in U.S. Department of Agriculture Zones 7 and 8.      Where hard freezes are frequent, the plants need the      protection of a plastic tunnel. In all climates, sow seeds      at least twice a year where you want the plants to grow      - first thing in spring and again in late summer, for      a fall crop. Choose a sunny spot, and use only a little      fertilizer-too much can make the leaves taste bland.    </p>    <p>      For quick germination, soak seeds in water overnight before      planting out; bury the seeds about an inch deep. If too      many seedlings appear, thin the plants to about 5 inches      apart. Cilantro can be transplanted if the operation is      conducted with minimal disturbance to the roots, but this      plant grows so well when sown directly into the garden that      starting seeds indoors is hardly worth the trouble. Begin      picking leaves as needed when the plants are about 6 weeks      old. Soon afterward (especially in spring, when days      quickly become longer and warmer), the shape of the leaves      becomes very thin and feathery, and the plants suddenly      grow taller and prepare to flower (the process known as      bolting). If you like edible flowers, try some of the tiny      white blossoms sprinkled onto salads.    </p>    <p>      To harvest coriander seeds, cut the stems when about half      of the seeds have changed from green to grayish-tan. Gather      the stems together with a rubber band, and hang the bunch      upside-down in a warm, dry place for about two weeks. To      glean (harvest) the seeds, place a paper bag beneath the      bunch and gently tickle the seeds from the stems. Dump the      seeds into a dry pan, sort by hand and store in airtight      glass jars until you're ready to plant or eat them.    </p>    <p>      <em>Sources of coriander seeds include: Johnny's Selected      Seeds (2 varieties), (207) 861-3901, <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com" target="_blank">www.johnnyseeds.com</a>;      Park's Seed Company (2 varieties), (800) 213-0076,      <a href="http://www.parkseed.com" target="_blank">www.parkseed.com</a>; Richters Herbs (3 varieties), (905)      640-6677, <a href="http://www.richters.com" target="_blank">www.richters.com</a>.</em>    </p>    <p>      Adapted from Barbara Pleasant's forthcoming book, The Whole      Herb, to be published by Square One Publishers.    </p>    <h3>      Black-Eyed Pea Salsa    </h3>    <p>      In addition to black-eyed peas, any kind of fresh or canned      beans can be used for this recipe, which is sometimes      called garden caviar.
