                    <p><em>Most kitchen gardens contain at least one row of      onions, usually planted in the spring. Less well-known are      the fall-planted onions, including multiplying onions,    shallots and bulbing leeks</em></p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Brook Elliott    </h5>        <p>      They offer several advantages over their spring      counterparts. Fall-planted onions need to go in the ground      when few other garden chores demand to be done. They also      tend to be more reliable and productive, less day-length      sensitive and less subject to the depravations of pests and      diseases than the more-familiar onions of spring.    </p>    <p>      Other than garlic, these autumn onions mostly fall into the      <em>Allium cepa</em> var. <em>aggregatum</em> group,      although notable exceptions include bulbing leeks ( <em>A.      ampeloprasum</em> ) and the perennial Rakkyo ( <em>A.      Chinese</em> ). By and large, all multiply primarily      through the formation of new bulbs, which is called      vegetative propagation. Most alliums do not produce seed.    </p>    <p>      Identifying autumn onions can be confusing because the same      common name often is used to describe different plants. For      instance, potato onions sometimes are called Egyptian      onions, which actually are in the top-setting Proliferum      group.    </p>    <p>      To help clear the fog, here's a rundown of various popular      types:    </p>    <h3>      TOP-Setting Multiplying Onions.    </h3>        <p>      Also known as Egyptian onions, tree onions, top onions and      walking onions, these perennials set small bulblets on top      of tall stems, instead of producing underground bulbs or      making seed heads. The bulblets measure only 1/2 to 1 inch      in length and look like miniature purple-red onions. They      often are used for pickling and in vinaigrettes or soups,      and they will last several months in storage.    </p>    <p>      The weight of the bulblet cluster, if left alone, causes      the stem to bend, dropping the cluster to the ground, where      it roots and sends up new shoots - thus the "walking"      sobriquet. To propagate them, simply remove some of the      bulblets and plant them where you want new onions to grow.    </p>    <p>      The `Catawissa' onion is a variant of the Egyptian onion.      Its bulblets actually can send out shoots before touching      the ground, so that a second and sometimes even a third      tier of bulblets are produced.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bulbing Multiplying Onions.</strong> Most commonly      known as potato onions, these multipliers also are called      ground onions, inground onions and hill onions. Some carry      descriptive or varietal names as well, such as `Yellow,'      `Red,' `Kentucky Hill' and `Greeley's.'    </p>    <p>      To propagate, plant the bulbs in the fall. At maturity the      next summer, a single bulb divides into as many as 14 new      bulbs. Depending on the variety, the new bulbs can be      full-sized singles (as much as 3 inches in diameter), a      bunch of small bulbs, or a combination of large and small      bulbs.    </p>    <p>      As a general rule, the large onions are kept for the table      and the small ones are used as sets for planting out again.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Shallots.</strong> Botanically speaking, shallots      don't exist; they are a form of bulbing multiplying onion,      differentiated by their smaller size. Originally, they were      named for a plant found by the Crusaders, but they bear no      botanical relationship to that plant. Most shallots on the      market today are not even the same shallot so beloved by      the French. Instead, they are varieties developed by      crossing common onions with Welsh onions or other      multipliers - a primary aim of the plant breeders was      to create varieties that could be reliably reproduced.    </p>    <p>      Some authorities differentiate shallots from other      multipliers by the color of their skins. The Ontario      Ministry of Agriculture and Food, for example, identifies      shallots as those with red skins (or scales) and true      multipliers as those with yellow or brown skins. Most      shallots do not flower or produce seed, although breeders      have developed some new varieties that can be grown from      seed.    </p>    <p>      In practical terms, shallots are small, layered multipliers      with a special taste that falls somewhere between onion and      garlic. They are propagated in the ground the same as other      bulbing multipliers, and each bulb produces from four to a      dozen baby bulbs in a bunch, joined at the base by a      membrane. In most varieties, each bulb is split into two      large cloves that may or may not share a common wrapper.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bulbing Leeks.</strong> Leeks usually are      spring-planted from seed, but several types that are      neither precisely bulb nor multiplier do bridge the      botanical gap between seed-forming leeks and      non-seed-forming garlics. Three are of particular interest      to home gardeners.    </p>        <p>      The most familiar is elephant garlic, which forms huge      heads differentiated into cloves, each of which can grow to      the size of a big man's thumb. Occasionally, small, hard      bulbets form outside the main head as well. Elephant garlic      is propagated exactly like true garlic, by dividing and      replanting the cloves.    </p>    <p>      Perlzwiebel, also known as Portuguese onion, is another      bulbing leek. The head divides into small, round bulblets      resembling pearl onions that range from pearl size to an      inch in length, with the larger ones tending to be      flattened.    </p>    <p>      The third is the Los Mol wild leek, perhaps the least known      of the three. Naturalized throughout Europe (primarily in      Spain and the United Kingdom), each bulb divides into four      bulbs that sometimes have hard bulblets attached, like      elephant garlic. Either the full bulb or the bulblets can      be used for propagation.    </p>    <p>      Los Mol tastes like garlic, and those who know it say they      like it best in omelettes and soups. This leek is not a      truly wild plant; rather it once was widely cultivated,      particularly in church gardens. Some of the naturalized      European stands now are being rediscovered and harvested      for commercial purposes because interest among gardeners is      on the rise.    </p>    <p>      Except in the far north, standard leeks can be grown as a      fall/winter crop, too, particularly if they are well      mulched. To succeed, you should set seeds indoors in July      or August, to protect the plants from extreme summer heat,      and transplant them to the garden in September, when      temperatures begin to fall. Before cold-weather threatens,      make sure the plants are well mulched.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rakkyo.</strong> This allium is very familiar to      most gardeners, but they don't know it. If you've ever      bought a jar of those tiny pickled onions, which you      probably thought were pearl onions, chances are you bought      Rakkyos. The Japanese pickle and export thousands of      barrels of Rakkyo each year.    </p>    <p>      It is a multiplying perennial with a backwards-growing      twist. Planted in late summer, Rakkyo grows new leaves and      scapes, which are leafless stalks, at the same time.    </p>    <p>      In October, the scapes put out flower heads that do not      produce seed. The plant then goes through the same winter      dormancy as other autumn onions, producing bulbs in the      late spring and early summer. Each bulb divides into from      four to 14 new full-sized bulbs, each measuring roughly      1-by 1/2 inch.    </p>    <p>      By July, tile bulbing is complete; if not harvested (called      "lifting" with bull) crops) then, the plants go through a      short summer dormancy. By August, they start their growing      cycle again.    </p>        <h3 class="caption">      Onion Tips    </h3>    <p>      Heirloom onion grower David Cavagnaro says a few small      bulblets from walking onions or other autumn alliums easily      can be potted up and kept on a windowsill for a steady      supply of tender green onion tops in winter, Most of the      multipliers grow better indoors than chives during the cold      months of the year.    </p>    <p>      To make peeling small onions and shallots easier, some      restaurant chefs cut off one tip, drop the bulb into hot      oil briefly, drain and cool it, and squeeze out the      softened insides. Baking the bulbs like garlic, says      Cavagnaro, probably would work well, too.    </p>    <h3>      CULTIVATION    </h3>        <p>      Fall-planted onions can go into the ground at      tulip-planting time (and easy way to remember when to plant      them) and, in most cases, the onions should be cultivated      just like garlic. Although they will grow in any soil, they      prefer , a rich, light loam that allows them to "stretch      their legs," or spread.    </p>    <p>      Onions also are heavy feeders, so the soil should be      amended (enriched) regularly. For a new planting, equal      parts of dried blood, bone meal and hardwood ashes should      be worked into the soil at the rate of one cup to every      10-foot row before planting takes place.    </p>    <p>      Established plantings should be fertilized with the same      soil amendments and/or compost by side-dressing the plants,      which means spreading the materials around their bases.    </p>    <p>      Planting can take place anytime the soil can be worked, as      long as the plants' root structures have time to develop be      fore the ground freezes. In most of the United States,      October to December is prime fall-onion-planting time.    </p>    <p>      During warmer-than-normal winters, some sprouting may take      place before the plants go completely dormant; in such a      case, the tender sprout leaves may suffer frostbite over      the winter but the plants themselves will not be harmed.    </p>    <p>      All fall onions but shallots should be planted from 2 to 4      inches deep and from 4 to 6 inches apart. Space the rows at      least 8 inches apart, so you have room to hoe. In far      northern areas, it's OK to mulch them in winter.    </p>    <p>      Shallots should be planted less deeply than the others      - with their tops just under or level with the soil      line, like spring-planted onion sets. This way, the      shallots will grow on top of the soil, like common onions.      In colder areas, shallots absolutely require mulching.    </p>    <p>      The tops of fall-planted onions will start to dry up and      die back in mid-summer. When about half the leaves have      died, the bulbs should be harvested. If the weather is      fair, they can cure right on top of the soil. In wet      weather, spread them out in a sheltered area that is warm      but not subject to direct sunlight. In either case, after a      few days, hang them in bunches to finish drying.    </p>    <h3>      Chicken 'Chinense'    </h3>    <p>      <em>4 chicken breasts, skinned, deboned<br />      1/2 cup Rakkyo onions (or shallots)<br />      3 garlic cloves, minced<br />      1 cup rnayonnaise<br />      Juice of 2 limes<br />      1/4 teaspoon cayenne<br />      Salt and pepper to taste<br />      Paprika</em>    </p>    <p>      Trim and peel the Rakkyo, and cut each bulb in half      lengthwise. Combine the mayonnaise, onions, garlic, cayenne      and lime juice. Slice the chicken breasts into strips about      1/2-inch thick, cutting across the grain. Lightly saute the      strips, turning once, until they just turn opaque.    </p>    <p>      Combine the sauteed chicken with the mayonnaise mixture and      refrigerate at least two hours. Transfer the ingredients to      a baking dish, sprinkle with the paprika and bake at 350      degrees about 20 minutes.    </p>    <h3>      Mussels with Garlic& Shallots    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 teaspoons olive oil<br />      Generous pinch cayenne<br />      2 /3 cup shallots, minced<br />      3 garlic cloves, minced<br />      2 cups semisweet white wine<br />      24 mussels, cleaned and debearded<br />      l tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped</em>    </p>    <p>      Heat the oil in a heavy skillet. Add the cayenne and wait      30 seconds. Add the shallots and garlic; saute three to      four minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the wine and bring      to a simmer. Add the mussels. Cover and steam until the      shells open, five to six minutes. Discard any mussels that      do not open. Divide evenly between four shallow dishes, and      sprinkle with rosemary.    </p>    <h3>      Baked Garlic    </h3>    <p>      Remove loose skins, slice off the top of each head (pointy      end), arrange in a baking dish and drizzle with oil.    </p>    <p>      Cover with foil and bake 45 minutes at 350 degrees; remove      cover and bake another 15 minutes, until garlic is soft and      golden. Cool. To serve, squeeze soft garlic out of skins      and spread on meat or bread.    </p>    <h3>      Onion Pie    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 cup fine cracker crumbs<br />      1/2 stick plus 2 tablespoons butter<br />      2 claps multiplying onions, thinly sliced<br />      2 eggs, lightly beaters<br />      3/4 cup milk<br />      3/4 teaspoon salt<br />      Dash pepper<br />      1/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded<br />      Paprika</em>    </p>    <p>      Melt 1/2-stick of butter; stir in cracker crumbs and press      the mixture into an 8-inch pie plate. In a skillet, saute      the onion slices in 2 tablespoons of butter until they are      transparent. Spoon them into the prepared pie plate.      Combine the eggs, milk, salt and pepper; pour mixture over      the onions. Sprinkle with shredded cheese and paprika, and      bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.    </p>    <h3>      Fall Onion Sources    </h3>    <p>      Shallots are becoming easier to find on the commercial      market, but multiplying onions and bulbing leeks still are      rare. Only a few seed houses carry them, so you will be      more likely to find them through seed-saving organizations,      such as Seed Savers Exchange, or through private growers.      Among commercial sources, Horus Botanicals may be the only      company with a full range of shallots, multiplying onions      and bulbing leeks.    </p>    <p>      Key: B=Bulbing Leeks; P=Potato Onions; S=Shallots; and      T=Topsetting Onions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Halifax Seed</strong> (S) PO.
