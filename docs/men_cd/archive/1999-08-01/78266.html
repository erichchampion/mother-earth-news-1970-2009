FARM SUPPLIES</h3><p><strong>LEAD</strong></p><p>Very common culprit in farm animal poisonings.</p><p>Found in paint, batteries, grease and used motor oil.</p><p>Most common in cattle and dogs, but all animals may be affected.</p><p>Symptoms include dullness, lack of coordination, blindness or convulsions.</p><p><strong>COAL TAR</strong></p><p>Found in tar paper, creosote-treated wood, clay pigeons and tarbased flooring.</p><p>Pigs often affected after chewing treated wooden farrowing crates; cats are very sensitive as well.</p><p>Neurological signs, weakness, collapse and sudden death are often seen.</p><p>May also cause decreased growth rate in young pigs.</p><h3>5. HOUSEHOLD</h3><p><strong>CHOCOLATE</strong></p><p>The obromin in unsweetened baker's chocolate can cause severe illness; cases usually involve dogs.</p><p>Five ounces of baker's chocolate can be fatal to a 20-pound canine.</p><p>Typical signs are nervousness, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures and occasionally coma.</p><p><strong>HOUSEPLANTS</strong></p><p>Most often involves holiday poisonings of kittens and puppies chewing on poinsettias, Easter lilies, mistletoe, philodendrons, spider plants and others.</p><p>Signs vary widely, but often include vomiting and neurological symptoms</p><p>Toxicity varies a among individual plants.</p><p><strong>CLEANING SUPPLIES AND MEDICATIONS</strong></p><p>Bored, young or inquisitive dogs may chew through plastic bottles and pill containers.</p><p>Most household cleaners will cause severe vomiting and diarrhea.</p><p>Tylenol, Advil, Aleve and other over-the-counter medications may be toxic and potentially fatal to cats and dogs</p>
