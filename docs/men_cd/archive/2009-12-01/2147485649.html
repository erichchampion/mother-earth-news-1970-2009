        <p>The vibrant spread above includes tomatoes, peppers, cranberry beans, ‘Triamble’ squash, and ‘Rouge Vif d’Etampes,’ also known as the Cinderella pumpkin. Trailing down from the basket of peppers are Brussels sprouts, which originated in Belgium more than 400 years ago and were introduced to the United States by Thomas Jefferson.</p><p><strong>SIMPLE ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH CHERRIES AND NUTS</strong></p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><p><em>2 cups Brussels sprouts<br />2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />Coarse sea salt<br /></em><em>Dried cherries<br />Toasted nuts</em></p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly grease baking pan with oil. Wash Brussels sprouts and cut a small X in the bottom of each one for even cooking. Place sprouts in a large bowl and drizzle with the olive oil and toss gently. Arrange on the greased pan in a single layer. Roast about 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. When sprouts are tender and lightly browned, transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle with salt and optional dried cherries or toasted nuts. Serve immediately.</p><p></p><hr /><h5>See <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Seed-Savers-Exchange-Recipes.aspx" target="_blank">Glorious Heirloom Fruits and Vegetables</a> for more fabulous garden photos and recipes.</h5><p></p><h5>The <a href="http://www.seedsavers.org/" target="_blank">Seed Savers Exchange</a> is a nonprofit network of gardeners dedicated to preserving and sharing heirloom seeds.</h5>
