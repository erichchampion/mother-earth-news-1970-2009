        <p>Stumped on what to give this holiday season? In this gift guide, we’ve included five great items that are as much fun to give as they are to get.</p><h3>Vibram FiveFingers: Funky, Fun Footwear</h3><p>“What the heck is on your feet?!” Why, Vibram Fivefingers - the coolest shoes since shoes were invented, and the closest you can possibly get to going barefoot. With individual pockets for each toe and thin Vibram TC1 performance rubber soles, FiveFingers let you play as though barefoot, but have just enough sole to protect your feet from rocks, glass and whatever else you encounter on the trail or city sidewalks. Assistant Editor Aubrey Vaughn says, “I love that my feet feel stronger and how my toes respond to unpaved terrain, and they’re great for running unfettered through puddles.” FiveFingers come in several styles.</p><p>Starting at $75; 978-318-0000; <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/" target="_blank">Vibram FiveFingers</a> (Order from <a href="http://www.kayakshed.com/" target="_blank">Kayak Shed</a> for free shipping.)</p><h3>Rosie’s Workwear for Women</h3><p>For the active women in your life, consider a pair of overalls or coveralls made by Rosies Workwear. The overalls we tried out this summer were terrific - they’re soft, made of medium-weight cotton, and have removable foam kneepads and pant legs that unzip to convert to shorts. All in all, a premium product.</p><p>$45; 805-541-2443; <a href="http://www.rosiesworkwear.com/" target="_blank">Rosie’s Workwear</a></p><h3>Buck Kives’ Gamut: A Cutting-edge Knife</h3><p>For anyone who spends time outdoors, you can’t go wrong with a pocket knife as a gift.
