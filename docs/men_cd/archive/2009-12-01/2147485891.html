        <p>We just about fell out of our chairs when we took a close look at the figures that edible-landscaping expert Rosalind Creasy reports for the value of homegrown food in <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/Square-Foot-Gardening-Food.aspx" target="_blank">Grow $700 of Food in 100 Square Feet!</a> About $7 per square foot is the value of the food she grew in her plot. Doesn’t sound that impressive at first glance, does it? But let’s extend that figure a bit.</p><p>Creasy used a small test plot of just 100 square feet, but we know from our <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/ipost.aspx?opt_in_source=header" target="_blank">surveys</a> that the average garden of <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> readers is more than three times that size. We also know that more than 80 percent of you garden. Plus, more and more of you are using season-extending techniques to produce food for six to eight months instead of just three or four.</p><p>Add all of this together, and we estimate that <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> readers <em>grow more than $1 billion worth of fresh food every year. Yowzah!</em></p><p>Most of you already know about the benefits of homegrown organic food, beyond the amount it saves on your grocery bills - great flavors, better nutrition, no pesticides and lots of “I grew that!” pride. And these days, there’s something else that many of us are getting from our food gardens. Even if you only grow a few crops in a small space, isn’t there something supremely reassuring about knowing that <em>you know how</em> to grow your own food? In realizing that, if supermarket food supplies were threatened, you could dig up the yard and grow your own potatoes?</p><p>Speaking of digging up the yard, there appears to be quite a lot of that going on right now. Whether it’s a desire for better tasting food or concerns about the cost or safety of supermarket fare, more and more folks are deciding to put in a food garden. One sign of this is that seed companies are reporting booming sales.</p><p>We’re doing everything we can to produce information to help beginning gardeners succeed, while at the same time bringing you cutting-edge reports on topics such as biochar (<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/Make-Biochar-To-Improve-Your-Soil.aspx" target="_blank">Make Biochar - this Ancient Technique Will Improve Your Soil</a>) and finding safe compost (<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Grow-It/Contaminated-Compost-Clopyralid-Aminopyralid-Pyralid-Dow-Chemicals-Toxins.aspx" target="_blank">Contaminated Compost: Coming Soon to a Store Near You</a>). With so many new gardeners shopping for supplies, we’re seeing some pretty silly - and sometimes seriously overpriced - garden products. Our goal is to help you find the least expensive options (<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2008-04-01/Build-Better-Soil-Free-Organic-Fertilizer.aspx" target="_blank">Build Better Soil with Free Organic Fertilizer!</a>) and highlight tools, such as the <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/shopping/detail.aspx?itemnumber=2563" target="_blank">NRG hand trowel</a>, that will help you garden better (<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Modern-Homesteading/Best-Garden-Tools.aspx" target="_blank">Three Great Tools: Rogue Hoe, NRG Trowel and Zeon Electric Riding Mower</a>).</p><p>Back to that billion dollar harvest: We would love to hear how much food you harvested this year and what crops you are enjoying now from your greenhouse or last summer’s garden. Tips from veterans for beginners are welcome, too. So check out <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/Square-Foot-Gardening-Food.aspx" target="_blank">Grow $700 of Food in 100 Square Feet!</a>, then share your stories by posting a comment to that article.</p>
