        <p>If you’re interested in buying beef or pork in bulk to save money and support local farmers, you’ll want to read this new publication, created by Iowa State University’s Small Meat Processors’ Working Group. Funded in part by the <a href="http://www.sare.org/" target="_blank">Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program</a>, the “Beef and Pork Whole Animal Buying Guide” explains the ins and outs of buying pork and beef as whole animals (or portions thereof) from local meat producers.</p><p>Small-scale meat producers may also consider using the publication to help clients make smart decisions and encourage return business. It contains an explanation of marketing terms and information on meat inspection, storage and handling, meat cut-out weight, and photos of common retail beef and pork cuts. This guide brings all the necessary pieces together in one easy-to-use resource.</p><p>You can view the free PDF or order print copies online by searching for the guide’s title at the <a href="http://www.extension.iastate.edu/store" target="_blank">Iowa State University Extension Store</a>.</p>
