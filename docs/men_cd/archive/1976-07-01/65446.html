    <p>
                <p><em>Wild berries!</em> Nothing's as likely      to set a mouth to watering and a body to thinking about      pies and jams and jellies and other suck excruciatingly      delicious treats. And there's no better time than right      now-mid-summer-for gathering nature's fruits      from fields and forests, roadsides and city streets,      meadows and open slopes. The berries you see here are only      a small sampling of the myriad types and varieties that can      be found in virtually any corner of North America, and you      shouldn't have much trouble locating at least one tasty      species within a few miles of your own back door. When you      do, try your best to get as many of the bite size morsels      past your mouth and into a collecting bucket as you can (a      formidable test of will power, to be sure), and remember to      return later ro the same spot if you see any flowers of      fruit yet to come. By carefully observing where and when      each variety in your region ripens, you many well be able      to "go a-berryin'" from late spring until the first few      weeks of fall!</p>			<h3>Blackberries</h3>        <p>      Blackberries are the forager's delight and the eternal bane      of botanists, who thus far have only been able to pin down      the number of individual species to "somewhere between 50      and 390". True blackberries are borne on thorny upright      canes (as opposed to trailing vines) and can be found      throughout most of the continent-including even      Arctic regions-along roadsides and hedgerows and in      abandoned meadows. Rich in vitamins A and C, the      fruit-which is preceded by large white flowers in      early spring-can usually be harvested from late June      to early August and beyond. Pick the berries when they're      dead-ripe sweet (one or two days after they've turned      black)</p>    <h3>Cranberries</h3>        <p>      The American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) thrives in      peaty bogs and similarly semi-marshy areas from Nova Scotia      to North Carolina and westward to Minnesota. The coast of      Massachusetts and other relatively cool regions near large      bodies of water are particularly prime territory for this      small shrub, which is easily identified by its thick      oval-shaped evergreen leaves and nodding pink or red      flowers that blossom between June and August. The tart      berries (best when cooked with honey, for sauces and jelly)      turn ripe-red during September and October and cling to      their branches throughout winter. They're especially good,      however, when picked soon after autumn's first frost.      </p>    <h3>Blueberries</h3>        <p>      Blueberries (genus: <em>Vaccinium</em> ) are one of the      world's most widespread fruits, and occur from the Tropics      to northern Alaska. The two most abundant species in the      U.S. are the low-bush blueberry (which rarely exceeds a      foot in height, and ranges from New England west to      Minnesota), and the high-bush variety (which can reach a      height of up to six feet, and grows throughout the Atlantic      coastal plain from Maine to Georgia and west to Lake      Michigan). Both ripen between July and September, and      thrive in areas of acid soil . . . particularly burned-over      fields and old pastures. Other, less common types can be      found from the mountains of the West Coast to the swamps of      New Jersey.</p>     <h3>Raspberries</h3>        <p>      The wild red raspberry <em>(Rubus strigosus)</em> is found      in dry or rocky areas from Newfoundland to British      Columbia, and south in the Alleghenies to North Carolina      and in the Rockies to New Mexico, The tangy, widely favored      fruit is borne on canes that grow from two to five feet      tall and are covered with many weak, bristly spines. Look      for the promising three- or five-petaled white flowers      between May and July, and make a mental note to bring a      bucket back with you several weeks later (mid-July to      September) when the canes will be laden with plump,      ripe-for-the-picking berries. You'll have to add commercial      pectin to the fruit if you intend to put it up as jam or      jelly.</p>     <h3>Strawberries</h3>        <p>      Although roughly half a dozen species of wild strawberries      (genus: <em>Fragaria</em> ) grow in this part of the world      (ranging from the Arctic Circle to Florida and west to      California), the fruit is found in greatest abundance in      the Northeast and eastern Canada. Plants sort three      coarsely toothed leaves, produce small five-petaled white      flowers in the spring, and bear fruit (which is most often      red, but sometimes white) between May and July. Look for      this most-sought-after forager's prize in open woods and      clearings, on exposed slopes, and along roadsides,      streambeds, and railroads. Harvest 'em soon after sunrise,      when they're still glistening with the early morning mist.      </p>    <h3>Huckleberries</h3>        <p>      If you pop an especially dark "blueberry" in your mouth and      promptly bite down on ten stone-hard seeds, you can be sure      that what you <em>really</em> have is a huckleberry. This      fruit's unfortunate preponderance of pits, however, is but      a small obstacle-overcome by straining the pulp      through a sieve-to folks who've come to savor its      unique and somewhat spicy flavor. Most species of      huckleberries (genus: <em>Gaylussacia</em> ) are, small      shrubs that favor acid soil, grow from a foot to three feet      tall, and range throughout most of the eastern, southern,      and northwestern states. Look for the almost-blackskinned      fruit from June to September in oak woods, logs, sandy or      rocky areas, and clearings.</p>     <h3>Gooseberries</h3>        <p>      Gooseberries are relatively common in moist woods      throughout Canada and across the northern border states of      this country, sometimes occurring as far south as Colorado      (in the West) and New Jersey (in the East). Mountainous      regions from Massachusetts to North Carolina may also be      the home of this tart round fruit. Gooseberries, which are      ripe when reddish-purple, are most often picked while still      green and flavored with honey or some other sweetener in      pies, jellies, and sauces. The shrub-like plant (genus:      <em>Ribes)</em> stands from two to four feet tall, displays      greenish or purplish flowers in May and June, and produces      bounty for the resourceful forager during July and August.      </p>    <h3>Mulberries</h3>        <p>      If you never ended a day as a child gloriously stuffed full      of and stained head to toe with-red mulberries (      <em>Morus</em> <em>rubra</em> <em>),</em> you might      consider trying it now. Nobody ever has or ever will "go      'round the mulberry bush" because the plant is actually a      tree, and can be found in fields and along roadsides (and      even city streets) throughout the eastern U.S. to as far      west as the Great Plains. The fruit ripens during July,      when the elongated berries turn deep purple and can easily      be shaken from their branches onto a blanket spread over      the ground below. You can dehydrate mulberries for winter      storage by stringing them up and drying them as you would      green-bean "leather britches".</p>     <h3>Dewberries</h3>        <p>      For practical purposes most foragers simply distinguish      dewberries from blackberries (both of which belong to the      genus <em>Rubus)</em> as "the ones that grow on trailing      vines rather than on canes". The general consensus is that      dewberries are the choicest of blackberry-like fruits . . .      they're bigger, fatter, juicier, and tastier. Look for the      telltale white flowers of this ground-hugging      plant-which favors dry soil, and ranges throughout      the eastern U.S. to as far west as Oklahoma-in the      spring, and be prepared to harvest its bounty beginning in      mid-June, or about two weeks earlier than the "ordinary"      blackberries in your area are ready for picking.     </p>    <h3>Currants</h3>        <p>      All species of wild currants-which ripen during July      and August-belong to the genus <em>Ribes</em> and      grow on small shrubs that sport maple-leaf-shaped foliage      and favor cold, wet woods. Most varieties of the fruit are      smooth, but a few are covered with short "bristles", and      nearly all exude a slightly disagreeable odor resembling      that of skunk cabbage. Red currants range throughout      southern Canada, along the Rockies to Colorado and the      Alleghenies to North Carolina, and in parts of New Jersey,      Indiana, and Minnesota. Black currants-which are      relatively rare-can sometimes be found in moist      forests from Nova Scotia to Virginia and west to Kentucky,      Iowa, and Nebraska.</p>     <h3>Elderberries</h3>        <p>      The sweet or common elder <em>(Sambucus canadensis)</em> is      a four-to-twelve-foot-high shrub that grows along roadsides      and in open fields and woods throughout the eastern half of      the U.S. and Canada. In July, the plant produces abundant      clusters of tiny white flowers-themselves a delicious      treat when fried in batter like fritters-that fill      the air with a heady perfume and (by early August) give way      to equally numerous bunches of berries. When green, the      fruit can be pickled and used to flavor sauces as a      substitute for capers. Most foragers, however, wait until      September . . . when the berries have ripened to a sweet      deep purple and virtually beg to be picked by the handful.      </p>    <h3>Black Raspberries</h3>        <p>      The wild black raspberry <em>(Rubus occidentalis,</em>      sometimes known locally as "thimbleberry") is more      widespread than its red-colored cousin, and a bit more      hazardous too . . . the canes' strong sharp thorns have      left many a berry picker scratched from the ankles up.      You're most likely to find this outrageously tasty species      along roadsides and fence rows and in neglected fields from      Quebec to Ontario and south to Georgia and Missouri. The      plant seems to have a special liking for old tree trunks      and rocky places, so keep an eye out for such spots when      you're looking. Black raspberries ripen during July and      early August . . . harvest 'em when they're plump and heavy      with juice.    </p>
