                    <p>      Science traditionally has held to the attitude that natural      organisms are a product of the environment: those fit to      survive, survive . . . and those unfit, parish. "Ecology"      is usually referred to as the relationship which exists      between natural organisms and their environment, with the      influence of the environment predominating.    </p>        <p>      Recently, however, a British scientist-James      Lovelock-has made a rather radical proposal which he      calls the "Gaea hypothesis" (after the Greek. goddess of      the earth). His suggestion is that the theory of evolution      as we understand it is a complete reversal of what actually      occurs in that we attribute the weight of influence to      environment rather than to the living organism.    </p>    <p>      The germ of Lovelock's theory comes from observations made      of outer space photographs of the planet, in which the      earth's mantle of atmosphere-drawn about her like a      cloak-suggested to him a protective modification of      the environment (such as a snail might find in its shell).    </p>    <p>      "If all the life organisms on earth are subtly      interrelated," he reasoned, "is it not possible that it is,      in fact, <em>one</em> organism ... <em>one</em> Life? And      is it not possible that Life has in large measure shaped      the environment of the earth to Its requirements, rather      than being primarily a product of environmental      circumstance?"    </p>    <p>      Life on earth, Lovelock feels, clearly exhibits the      characteristic of being a single organism with man in the      midst. And man, because of his nature, should be capable of      functioning something like a central nervous system to the      whole, thereby enhancing its development. Man, however, has      failed in this responsibility and, instead, proceeds      willy-nilly to alter the environment without regard for the      greater organism he centers. He alters the environment on      impulse ... an impulse which disregards the Life of the      Whole.    </p>    <p>      Lovelock suggests that Life began to shape Its expression      on earth many millions of years ago. It did this by      creating the atmosphere we now know from random gases      <em>and for the purpose of</em> developing a suitably      protective mantle that would allow the more delicate      expressions of the larger organism to emerge. Life,      then-human beings notwithstanding-is,      significantly, intelligent and has direction.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly enough, the scientific community is finding      that many supposed anomalies are explained by Lovelock's      hypothesis. According to the laws of chemistry, for      instance, most of the oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere      should have ended up in the seas as nitrate ions long ago.      Biological factors, however, do not permit this. Rather,      they modify the chemical process to the advantage of the      living organism.    </p>    <p>      They use the process to continuously refresh the      atmosphere.    </p>    <p>      Lovelock-whose work on industrial pollution is      supported by numerous large corpo rations-indicates      that the health of the one earth organism is deteriorating      rapidly. He cites, for example, that an immense danger is      emerging from the practices of modern agriculture. A      greater danger to Life, in fact, is developing in this area      of man's activities than in all the other      pollution-producing activities of industrial technology put      together.    </p>    <p>      Man's efforts to feed his proliferating population have      resulted in "modern" farming techniques and the wholesale      use of inorganic methods. Techniques and methods that      disrupt the balance of the whole organism and which have      begun to destroy delicately balanced ecological systems      within the organism. And Gaea needs these systems (such as      the previously mentioned atmosphere which, when properly      maintained, supplies the oxygen we need, filters out the      sun's dangerous cosmic rays and keeps them from harming us,      etc.).    </p>    <p>      Constantly urged on by his nature to ignorant,      self-centered manipulation of the natural environment, man      is rather like a radically disruptive central nervous      system to the whole ... inaccurate in his perceptions and      destructive in his compulsive modifications. Not only has      man reneged on his true responsibilities as an integral      part of the living organism ... but he has also injected      into the whole patterns of behavior which disrupt and      destroy the natural unconscious functions of the organism.      Man has become rather a malignant cancer in the body of      Life.    </p>    <p>      Man prides himself on his intelligence, perception, vision,      and the gift of reason. He sets himself proudly aside as      the one creature with the capacity for self-consciousness      that Life has brought forth on this earth. Yet to what      purpose has this "self-consciousness" of the whole organism      (which comes to focus in man) been put ... other than to      the self-centered, blind satisfaction of human greed as man      exploits the organism for his own use in much the same way      as an individual might abuse his body to satisfy some      incomprehensible and irrational craving.    </p>    <p>      A simple truth of Life on earth is that the whole survives      or nothing does, just as the survival of the body is      essential to the survival of the mind. Rather than      justifying human function as it has been known on earth,      man is well overdue for a dose of humility and a move      toward picking up his responsibilities. The      responsibilities of functioning as an integral, sensitive,      and intelligent part of the natural organism of this earth      ... and of letting his gift for self-consciousness be      exercised to the blessing of the whole creation of Life.    </p>
