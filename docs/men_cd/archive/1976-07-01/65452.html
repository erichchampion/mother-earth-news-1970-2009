    <p>
             <p>      Almost everyone has a storage problem of one sort or      another. And that used to include John Frost of Grafton,      Massachusetts . . . until two years ago, that is, when John      found a way to come out ahead in "the race for space".    </p>    <p><strong>      storage space for just a little more than $100 per square      foot:    </strong></p>        <h5 id="byline">      by John Frost    </h5>       <p>      John Frost Nothing beats having an honest-for-real barn      when you're in need of a sheltered place to park the old      Farmall or stash 20 extra bales of hay. Unfortunately,      though, many back-to-the-landers-myself      included-don't <em>have a</em> barn, and can't afford      the investment of time and money necessary to build one.      (Which helps explain why most of us have more tools and      machinery sitting out in the open, exposed to all kinds of      weather, than is right and proper.)    </p>    <p>      ' Then again, if you're "fresh out" of storage      space-and if (like me) you can't see your way clear      to construct a genuine barn-it may interest you to      know that you can come by all-weather storage space for      slightly over $1.00 per square foot . . . if you'll just do      the building yourself.    </p>    <p>      My new "did it myself" storehouse (see accompanying photos)      contains approximately 500 square feet of floor space, took      me six weekends to erect, and set me back only $528 for      materials. The structure is functional, attractive, and      sufficiently spacious for my needs (it holds-with      ease-two cars, a tractor, and a canoe). <em>And</em>      the shed meets all local construction codes . . . which      means [A] it can handle the substantial snow loads of a      typical New England winter, and [B] no building inspector      can ever "throw the book at me" for non-compliance with The      Rules.    </p>    <h3>      FIRST, THE CODE    </h3>    <p>      The very first thing you should do if you decide to build a      shed like mine is trek on down to your city clerk's office      and obtain a copy of the local building code. (Some      municipalities sell the book, others give the manual to      anyone who asks for it, and still others yet have no copies      of the guide for distribution in any manner. If you run      into the last situation, however, there is an easy way to      find out exactly what you'll have to do to keep the      building inspector happy: just apply for a construction      permit.)    </p>    <p>      If you're lucky enough to be able to take home a copy of      the code book, you'll find that the volume offers a bonanza      of useful information for the do-it-yourself builder. For      example, the fourteen tables and appendices of my town's      manual list such things as allowable spans for various      sizes of rafters under given load conditions, load-bearing      qualities of assorted soil types, and other hard-to-get      technical info. As a result-ironically      enough-that code book is one of the most valued      volumes on my reference shelf.    </p>    <h3>      PLANNING: THE KEY TO SUCCESS    </h3>    <p>      There's an old saying that "an hour's planning will save      three hours' work: one hour when the job is first done, and      two more when you have to do it over". Believe me, this      statement is just as true for the shed-builder as it is for      the manufacturers of jumbo jets.    </p>    <p>      Plan ahead, then. Start by asking yourself how large a      storehouse you really want. (And don't be too conservative      in your estimate or, if you're like most people, you'll be      wishing the shed were twice as big within six months of its      completion.) A good idea is to decide how much space you      need to corral your present inventory of unsheltered goods      . . . and then add at least half again as much square      footage to your projected building's floor plan.    </p>    <p>      Of course, before you get <em>too</em> carried away with      the design of your own private warehouse, you'll have to      face reality and ask yourself how large a storage building      you can actually afford. Since prices do vary in different      parts of the country, I highly recommend that you [1]      compare the current cost of supplies in your area to the      prices mentioned further on in this article, [2] modify my      "buck per square foot" figure accordingly, and      <em>then</em> [3] roughly calculate just how much your      "dream shed" is going to set you back. If the price is out      of the ballpark, you'll-naturally-have to think      again about the size of your yet-to-be storehouse.    </p>    <p>      And have you chosen a site for the shed? And is that site      reasonably level? Will you have to clear away trees or      stumps before you can build? What about drainage: Are you      absolutely certain that the first afternoon thunderstorm      that comes along won't transform half your building's floor      into a pig wallow or (worse yet) leave the shed waist deep      in water? Go outside and drive some stakes into the ground      to mark out the four corners of your proposed structure.      Then sit down and <em>think</em> about what those stakes      are trying to tell you. Take a long, hard look.    </p>        <p>      Naturally, you've planned to position the shed so that its      open side faces away from the prevailing winds of winter.      Likewise, it's a good idea-if you can-to locate      the building downwind of something larger (your house, a      row of tall trees, etc.), so that the little storage shed      is at least partially "blanked out" during periods of      heavy, blowing precipitation. <em>Think</em> and plan!      Remember, if you have any complaints about the size, cost,      or location of your structure <em>after</em> it's built,      you'll have but one person to squarely place the blame on.      And it sure won't be me!    </p>    <h3>      THOUGHTS ON DESIGN    </h3>    <p>      Once you've chosen a suitable construction site and you      know the approximate dimensions of your mini-warehouse,      you'll want to concentrate on the structure's actual      design. I chose the tried-and-true "carriage" style for my      own shed, a configuration which-I think-rather      effectively combines rustic charm with efficient use of      materials and, more importantly, makes for easier      construction.    </p>    <p>      If you've ever seen an authentic carriage shed alongside a      19th century farmhouse, you know that a good deal of      oldtime Yankee foresight is evident in the general layout      of such buildings. The pitched roof, for instance, ensures      good drainage and helps to support heavy loads of, ice and      snow . . . while the use of bays as basic modules permits      flexibility where size is concerned. (Need more space? Add      another bay!) For a truly practical all-weather storage      structure, the carriage-style shed is hard to beat.    </p>    <p>      If you want to experiment a little with the design of your      storage building-but you feel, perhaps, that you lack      the necessary drafting or engineering know-how-check      the larger libraries in your area for <em>Architectural      Graphic Standards</em> by Charles G. Ramsey and Harold R.      Sleeper ($44.95 from John Wiley & Sons). Between the      advice contained in this tome and the info tucked away in      the pages of your building code, you'll have grist for many      an evening's reading and sketching!    </p>    <h3>      GET IT ON PAPER    </h3>    <p>      You don't have to be a design draftsman to work up a usable      set of plans for your mini-warehouse. (I should qualify      that: <em>Some</em> building inspectors do, in fact,      require buildersand that includes owner-builders-to      submit <em>professionally drafted plans</em> for approval.      Others will settle for a rather crude sketch. Moral: Visit      city hall <em>first</em> . . . before you set pencil to      paper.)    </p>    <p>      Crude sketch or detailed plans, all you need to make your      building's drawings are a sharp pencil, a ruler, and a pad      of graph paper. Keep in mind-no matter what the local      building inspector asks for-that your plans must be      detailed enough to [1] enable you to calculate the amount      of lumber and other materials you'll need for the project,      and [2] allow you-when the time comes-to cut      and join beams in an orderly fashion.    </p>    <p>      OK. Pick a scale for your plans (say, one inch equals two      feet). Then sketch front-view and side-view outlines of the      shed, to scale (Fig. 1).    </p>    <p>      Next, from your front- and side-view drawings, determine      the exact sizes of framing lumber that you'll need for the      building. And <em>strive for efficient use of materials.      You</em> may find, for example, that the load-bearing      requirements and overall dimensions of your structure's      roof are met by several combinations of rafter size and      rafter spacing. However, only <em>one</em> such combination      will require the fewest board feet of lumber, and      <em>that's</em> the combination you're looking for.    </p>    <p>      Don't forget, too, that lumber is usually sold in      <em>multiples of two running feet.</em> Which means that if      your plans call for a number of nine-foot-long studs,      you'll either have to [A] change the framing dimensions to      an even number of feet (eight or ten), or [B] accept the      fact that you're going to have a large stack of expensive      cutoff ends to feed to the fireplace after the building is      up.    </p>    <p>      As soon as you've settled on the most economical dimensions      for your mini-warehouse, begin a detailed cross-section      drawing (see Fig. 2) of the structure. Show all framing      members to scale and you should be able to use the drawing      to make up a complete list of all the materials you'll need      to fabricate the shed.    </p>    <h3>      ABOUT MATERIALS    </h3>    <p>      While I don't deny that it may be well worth your while to      scout up a supply of low-cost <em>used</em> lumber for the      construction of your building, I do feel that-unless      you happen to be long on time and short on cash-you      should be extremely wary of offers of free henhouses,      barns, and the like. That dilapidated old barn with the      45° list (which the owner says you can have "free" for      the dismantling) may not contain enough sound, usable wood      to justify the many backwrenching hours you'll spend      ripping it apart. The final decision, of course, is up to      you . . . but I prefer to stick with all-new lumber from a      building supply house or a good local sawmill.    </p>        <p>      Once you've found a source of framing timbers, check with      sawmills in your area for rough-cut boards to use as      roofing and siding. (Fresh-cut, green, ungraded      stock-which is all you really need for exterior      siding-is vastly less expensive than the cured and      graded material sold by commercial lumber dealers.) A visit      to the sawmill will not only save you money, but will lift      your spirits as well. The sight of all that pitch and      sawdust flying-and the almost overpowering aroma of      fresh-cut pine (and other woods)-is guaranteed to      bring out the latent lumberjack in just about anyone!    </p>    <h3>      FOUNDATIONS    </h3>    <p>      Now that you know what you're going to build and where      you're going to get the materials with which to build it,      you're ready to start on your shed's foundation (if any).    </p>    <p>      A full foundation and floor are necessary only if you      intend to heat the building . . . otherwise, it's hard to      justify the expense and labor involved in pouring a      concrete slab. Concrete columns spaced every six or eight      feet along the load-bearing walls will support the      structure just as well as a slab will and at a fraction of      the cost. (In fact, a mix consisting of cement, stones,      sand, and water should keep the cost of each pier to a very      reasonable three or four dollars.)    </p>    <p>      The holes for your columns should be two feet in diameter      and deep enough to penetrate the frost line (which-in      the northeastern U.S.-lies three to four feet below      the surface). Once you've filled each hole to within a      couple inches of the top with mix, check the piers for      level by the following procedure:    </p>    <p>      [1] Set an identical wide-bottomed block or container (I      used inverted plastic buckets) on each of two adjacent      piers, [2] lay a beam across the two upside-down pails, and      [3] take a reading with a level along the top of the beam.      If the beam is not level, add cement to the hole on the low      side, and repeat the procedure. Do this for each pair of      adjacent piers (making sure, as you go around the building,      that you check <em>every</em> pier to both the one "behind"      and the one "ahead") and you can be reasonably certain of      ending up with a level foundation.    </p>    <p>      If you like, you can make a form into which concrete can be      poured so that the top of each foundation pier is built up      six to ten inches above the ground. Or you can simply leave      every poured column flush with the earth's surface and lay      a concrete block down (with its holes pointed up) atop each      wet concrete piling. It's then easy to poke the hook end of      a threaded tiedown bolt down through one of the holes in      the block until the hook is embedded in the freshly poured      concrete below. The holes in the block itself can also be      filled with concrete at the same time. Result: A solid,      substantial pier that extends to below frost line and to      which (because of the tiedown bolt) one of the structural      members of the building's frame can be quickly and securely      attached.    </p>        <h3>      SOUND STRUCTURAL ADVICE    </h3>    <p>      Because the shed's sills carry whatever load is not borne      by the foundation columns, pick something husky when you're      deciding what size lumber to use here. For total peace of      mind, I used double 2 X 8's. (If wood-nibbling insects      inhabit your neck of the woods, be sure to coat the sills      with preservative . . . no matter <em>how</em> big the      beams are.)    </p>    <p>      Likewise, since your framing lumber is what holds the whole      shebang up, you'll want to use only clear, dry,      construction-grade beams for the skeleton of your storage      building. Remember, this isn't the place to skimp on      quality . . . so don't let cost considerations interfere      with common sense. (When I built my shedwhich is to say, in      the spring of 1974-good-quality framing beams sold for      between 22 cents and 30 cents per board foot. And as a      result, a major portion of my total expense went into the      building's structural lumber.)    </p>    <p>      Something you should keep in mind is that the use of      <em>collar beams</em> (Fig. 2) will almost double the      load-bearing capacity of your shed's rafters. The strength      of these beams is almost entirely a function of their depth      (rather than width) . . . thus, there's no need to use      thick material here. Put thin (but deep) collar beams under      your rafters, and you'll not only save money on the beams      themselves, but you'll also be able to use less rafter      material.    </p>    <p>      As mentioned earlier, rough-sawn (green) boards can be used      for the storage shed's roof decking and siding. You're      right, of course, if you say that plywood goes on a lot      faster . . . but the last time I checked, 3/4" plywood was      selling for about 334 per square foot and rising, compared      to the 11 cents to 16 cents per board foot being fetched by      sawmill-fresh, random-length pine boards. A price      difference like that translates into a whopping big savings      in the final cost of this building. Why spend when you can      save?    </p>    <p>      When you nail the vertical siding on, by the way, take care      to butt each rough-sawn board tightly against the preceding      one to keep the effects of shrinkage to a minimum.      Naturally, the green boards will shrink a little as they      dry out, and this will produce visible gaps. If the gaps      bother you (or if you <em>must</em> have weathertight      walls), shiplap the openings with thin furring strips.      <em>(For a good discussion of the art of building with      green lumber, see "The Green Wood House"; pages 84-86, in      MOTHER NO. 39.-The Editors.)</em>    </p>    <h3>      FINISHING TOUCHES    </h3>    <p>      Finishing a building can be expensive . . . as anyone who's      built a house, barn, garage, shop, etc., knows. And      probably the most expensive "finishing touch" of all is the      weatherproofing that you'll surely want to add.    </p>        <p>      To weatherproof my shed's roof, I applied asphalt      shingles-which cost $12 per square (one square equals      100 square feet)-over black roofing paper. By      comparison, roll asphalt roofing runs about two-thirds the      cost and cedar shakes are almost twice as expensive as      asphalt shingles.    </p>    <p>      Yes, you can simply let the walls of the shed weather.      You'll find, however, that uncured pine tends to turn a      blotchy black if left untreated (in contrast to cedar,      which becomes silver-gray with time). Thus, it      pays-if you plan to leave any siding and/or roofing      exposed to the elements-to protect the wood with some      sort of finish. I treated my shed with a semi-transparent      preservative/stain.    </p>    <p>      The dirt floor can be covered with a couple of inches of      3/4" stones (about $4.00 per yard, delivered) to keep it      looking neat and to prevent grass from growing inside the      building. Pea stone is fancier . . . but, then again, it's      also more expensive. (Caution: DON'T allow the stones to      spread outside the confines of the shed if you intend to      use a snow blower-rather than a snowplow-to      clear snow from around the building during the winter.)    </p>    <h3>      AND REMEMBER . . .    </h3>    <p>      Whether you build a closet-sized toolshed or a      5,000-square-foot warehouse, the most important work you do      on the building will be done in its planning and design. Do      a sloppy job of charting out the construction, and you can      look forward to huge cost (and time) overruns. Do an      adequate job of preparation, however, and-like      me-you'll be able to have all the storage space you      need . . . for little more than $1.00 per square foot!    </p>
