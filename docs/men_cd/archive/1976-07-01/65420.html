               <p>      <em>Can a fed-up corporate executive forfeit his pole      position in the rat race, build a $500 smokehouse out in      the country ... and rapidly begin earning more than $2,000      a month selling home-cured fish to bars and restaurants?      Yep. Buck Taylor, a Florida man, has done just that ... and      he insists that others (maybe you) can do it too!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In MOTHER NO. 39, Buck told you how he founded his      enterprise, gave you tips on locating a dependable source      of raw fish, showed you how to construct a smokehouse just      like his, listed all the equipment you'll need to set      yourself up in business, gave you the lowdown on pricing      the fish you smoke, and projected the profits that such a      venture can earn.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In the following pages, Mr. Taylor generously supplies      the final bit of information that you must have to enter      the fish-smoking business: his own personal "secrets" of      dressing out and curing the fillets and other cuts that he      so successfully sells.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by BUCK TAYLOR    </h5>    <h3>HOW TO DRESS THE FISH YOU SELL</h3>    <p>      Once you've finished the construction of your smokehouse      and gathered together the necessary supplies, you're ready      to smoke your first batch of fish. Which really means that      you're ready to clean and dress your first fish.    </p>    <p>      Start by making a brine. It's easy. Just pour eleven pounds      of salt into the tank (bathtub) you installed in the      smokehouse. Fill the tub half full of water and stir well      to dissolve the salt. Then add ice as necessary to keep the      temperature of the brine at or below 60° Fahrenheit      (check the temperature from time to time).    </p>    <p>      You can add as many or as few spices to the brine as you      like. Just remember, though, that the extra ingredients      cost extra money. Those two or three dollars' worth of      seasonings <em>must</em> be reflected in the final taste of      your product if you expect your customers to pay a premium      price for the added touch.    </p>    <p>      I keep my overhead down by using just two      spices-oregano and dried mustard-in my brine,      and I find them all I need to give my fish the      palate-pleasing aftertaste that my customers want. If      you're determined to experiment with something fancier,      however, here's some optional-and I repeat,      <em>optional</em> -spices and flavorings that some      smokers add to their brine: allspice, bay leaf, brown      sugar, dill, garlic, ginger, honey, lemon juice, maple      flavoring, molasses, onion salt, seasoned pepper, soy      sauce, Tabasco, and white pepper.    </p>    <p>      As soon as your brine is ready and waiting (and remember to      add a little ice from time to time to keep the solution at      60° F or lower), you can begin to clean and trim your      fish.    </p>    <p>      Experience has shown me that the <em>larger</em> the      individual fish, the <em>better</em> I like it when I'm      preparing fillets for the oven. It's much easier to slice      and trim four big 200-pounders than to dress out a hundred      or so smaller fish. (I ought to know: Once I even cleaned      an eight-foot-long, 548-pound blue marlin. You should've      been there!)    </p>    <p>      Relatively large fish-those weighing more than, say,      ten pounds-should he cut into slabs (see Fig. 2) for      brining. Use your knife to make slits along the top and      bottom of the critter's side parallel to its fins and      backbone. Then cut across the fish just behind its head.      When the knife hits bone, turn the blade sideways and work      it toward the tail with a sawing motion while you keep the      cutting edge as close to the backbone as possible to reduce      waste. Use basically the same technique on the      <em>really</em> "big 'uns" (fish weighing 150 pounds or      more), but remove the chunks of flesh from the backbone one      section at a time.    </p>    <p>      Billfish, incidentally, have concave hollows on either side    </p>    <p>      of their spines and, if you're not careful, these hollows      will prevent your knife blade from getting down under all      the meat attached to the backbone. Well I'm here to tell      you that the strips of flesh which lie in these protected      areas are absolutely the best-tasting parts of such fish      and should be salvaged if at all possible. So push the pads      of your fingers down against the bone and then slide them      toward the critter's tail. The strips I'm talking about      will come free quite easily . . . and are well worth the      extra effort it takes to get them.    </p>    <p>      Any slabs of meat more than three inches thick should be      sliced into smaller pieces so that the brine can penetrate      them better. (If the solution can't work all the way      through a thick chunk, the center of the piece won't cure      properly.)    </p>    <p>      Smaller fish (trout, cats, snappers, etc.) that tip the      scales at less than ten pounds can usually be split down      the center, opened up, and smoked whole. Removal of the      backbone from one of these "little 'uns" is optional, but      the head should always be cut off and discarded.    </p>    <p>      Filleted or whole, large fish or small, leave the skin on      all the pieces you smoke (it'll help reduce shrinkage). And      one final tip: Remove the blood-strip (from the meat along      the spine) of any fish that has one and throw the strip      away. Yes, this adds to your waste . . . but it also      greatly improves the taste of your finished product (and      that, after all, is what will keep you in business).    </p>    <h3>SOAK'EM IN BRINE</h3>    <p>      After you've sliced out a batch of fillets, wash all the      chunks of fish thoroughly in running water and drop them      into the tank of brine to soak overnight. TIP: If you put      all the thinner pieces into one end of the tub and all the      thicker ones into the other, you'll find it easier to load      your oven the next day. (Why? Because, sooner or later,      you'll want to sort out the thin slabs-which,      logically enough, require less curing-anyway, so you      can put them on the trays which go into the top of the      smoker ... farthest from the fire.)    </p>    <p>      Before you go home for the evening, double-check to make      certain that every single morsel of fish is completely    </p>    <p>      covered by brine (even the merest corner of a fillet left      sticking out of the solution overnight can spoil or will,      at least, "taste funny" after it's smoked). It's also a      good idea to cover the loaded tub with a sheet of plastic      or a plywood top to keep out any insects that might have      wandered into the smokehouse while you were working. No, a      few bugs won't really hurt the fish you have soaking in the      brine . . . but they have a way of expiring in the solution      and winding up stuck to your choicest fillets. And      customers are funny when it comes to finding such little      surprises on the food they eat!    </p>    <p>      All finished? Fine. Now go home and get a good night's      rest. You'll need it, because tomorrow's workday starts at      4:00 a.m.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO LOAD THE OVEN</h3>   <p>      When you return to the smokehouse in the morning, you'll      find that all the soaking pieces of fish are covered with a      slick film. Wash it off by pushing your hand along the      entire surface of each fish, or piece of fish, while you      hold it under running water. Then repeat the process      without the running water. The first step forces excess      brine from the fillets and washes off the surface of the      chunks of fish. The second squeezes much of the remaining      moisture from each piece of meat. <em>Both are      important</em> : If you don't wash the brine away, the      inside of your oven will soon become gummy. If you fail to      force the excess water out of the fillets, your smoked fish      will be soft and wet inside.    </p>    <p>      Cut the soaked and washed fillets into four-inch squares so      that the heat will penetrate them more evenly. Then coat      the smoker trays with vegetable oil (to prevent sticking),      and place the slabs of meat- <em>skin side down</em>      , with the chunks spaced 1/4 inch apart-on the racks.    </p>    <p>      At this point I like to sprinkle seasoned pepper on my fish      (blue marlin, for instance, is so bland that I think it's      necessary to spice the species up a bit). You'll have to      decide for yourself, though, if the extra cost is justified      (your customers will quickly let you know).    </p>    <p>      As each tray is filled, slide it into the oven. Leave the      door open as you load the smoker-to facilitate air      drying-and, once all the fish are in, go around to      the other side of the curing chamber and start the fire.    </p>   <h3>SMOKING: THE LOW TEMPERATURE PHASE</h3>    <p>      Pull the firebox out, place paper and kindling in its      bottom, some branches and very small logs on top, and start      a blaze. When the fire is burning well, add a couple of      larger logs and-as soon as the big chunks of wood are      aflame-slide the firebox back into the oven and      halfway close the firebox's trapdoor.    </p>    <p>      Back inside the smokehouse, tightly close the oven loading      door and watch the thermometer mounted on it. When the      temperature inside the oven approaches 100° F, crack      the loading door about four inches or so (a small cloud of      pleasant-smelling smoke should emerge).    </p>    <p>      You'll soon find that you call regulate the temperature in      the smoking chamber with the oven's two doors. Open the      trapdoor to allow more draft past the fire ... and the      smoker will heat up. Close the trapdoor and it'll cool      down. And whenever you find yourself in a <em>real</em>      bind-with the temperature inside the oven      skyrocketing and threatening to damage a whole load of      fish-just pop the loading door open as wide and as      long as it takes to dump out the excess Btu's.    </p>    <p>      Bear in mind at all times that the proper regulation of      your smoker's temperature is extremely critical. Apply too      little heat, and your fish will not become completely      cured. Allow the temperature to climb too high, and the      slabs of mea will glaze over oil the outside and remain raw      in their centers. The moral is obvious: <em>Watch your      thermometer carefully and regulate the temperature of rour      oven exactly as I tell you</em>    </p>    <p>      The first two hours of the smoke cure-prolonged      drying, really-are conducted with the loading door      kept ajar and the firebox door positioned to maintain a      temperature of 120° in the smoker. This is as critical      as any part of the smoking operation, so keep a sharp eye      on everything. A sudden gust through the fire door can      quickly jump the temperature of the blaze a few degrees      which, in turn, can cause the flame to grow even brighter.      This won't cause you any real trouble if you're on top of      the situation ... but you certainly can't just walk off and      leave your load of fish to take its chances alone.    </p>    <p>      By the end of the first hour or so of this 120°      treatment, your fillets will be dripping water like ferns      in a rain forest and tiny bubbles will have risen oil the      top of each slab of fish. This is normal for the low heat      stage of the cure, and the more bubbles and drops of water,      the better. Along about this time, too, you'll notice that      your smokehouse is filling with [A] the delicate aroma of      smoked fish and, quite possibly, [B] people you hardly even      know. When strangers begin sniffing tile air and hanging      around to make small talk, you <em>know</em> you're in the      right business!    </p>        <h3>SMOKING: THE HIGH TEMPERATURE PHASE</h3>    <p>      After your fish have cured two hours at 120°, close the      oven's main door and open the trapdoor as much as necessary      to raise the smoker's temperature to 140° F. The      fillets will actually begin to cook now and (over a period      of approximately five hours) will turn a golden brown.    </p>    <p>      <em>Keep that oven smoky</em> . If you can't see smoke      coming out of the chimney, add bark, twigs, chips from tree      Cuttings, etc., to the firebox. You're not trying to raise      the temperature of the oven, remember, but you <em>do</em>      want your fire to smoke profusely. (NOTE: Although some      authorities recommend throwing handfuls of green branches      and leaves on the blaze at this point to make its smoke      thicker, I don't. Green wood and leaves, in my experience,      can impart a nasty flavor to foods. Therefore, although I      do use bark and twigs to increase the intensity of my      fire's smoke during this phase of the cure, I always make      sure that the chips, etc., are dry.)    </p>    <p>      Toward the end of the five-hour-long high-temperature part      of the smoke cure, you can prod the pieces of fish with a      finger. The slabs of meat should feel fairly solid ... and      most definitely <em>not</em> soft or wet.    </p>    <p>      When your piscatorial pleasures are done just right, you'll      know it! They'll be fit for a royal wedding banquet: golden      brown, flaky, and barely moist inside. That's the way my      fillets turn out anyway ... because that's the way my      customers like them.    </p>    <p>      Then again, it's hard to predict just what <em>your</em>      clientele will demand. Some people like their fish so      thoroughly cured that it's downright difficult to chew ...      others want it almost raw. Beer bars generally demand      little two-ounce packages of very salty and hard-cured      strips (that, when sold by the hundreds at 50 cents a pack,      noticeably increase their patrons' consumption of brew),      while cocktail lounges buy moist, flaky fillets, cut them      into small bits, and give them away to their customers.      You'll just have to experiment a little until you learn      what the folks in your area prefer, and then adjust your      drying and curing times-but <em>not</em> your oven's      temperature!-accordingly.    </p>            <p>      When your fillets have smoked as long as you want them to,      remove the trays of fish and set them out to cool for at      least an hour. You can speed this part of the process, if      you like, by setting up a fan or two to blow over the trays      ... but <em>don't</em> try to hasten the cooling by putting      the fish into a refrigerator while they're still warm. I      made that serious mistake once, and found myself with an      entire ovenload of soggy fillets on my hands!    </p>    <p>      Once the slabs of meat are completely smoked and have      thoroughly cooled, they can be frozen quite nicely and      stored for some time. The cured and cooled fish can also be      kept in the refrigerator unfrozen for up to a week ... but      I wouldn't try to store them any longer than that.    </p>    <h3>SOME FINAL WORDS OF ADVICE</h3>    <p>      Work your way into this business slowly in the beginning.      Try to line up your initial customers <em>before</em> you      run off that first full ovenload of fish. You're wise to      smoke a few small batches of fillets on your own at the      very start just to prove that you know what you're doing      and to provide some of your potential accounts with a      sample of your wares. Curing a whole smoker full of fish,      though, can run into real money (an investment of      approximately $500), and you should definitely have a few      buyers lined up before you take that plunge.    </p>    <p>      Sooner or later, the manager of one of the supermarkets or      restaurants you try to sell to is going to ask you if you      have product liability insurance. When that happens, you      can either go on down the street and peddle your fish to      someone else (and there's plenty of folks you can deal with      who'll never think to ask the question) ... or you can take      out a liability policy on your goods. The only trouble with      the second course of action is the fact that the liability      insurance you'll have to buy is enormously expensive (and,      therefore, a liability in itself). It can cost as much as      2% of your gross business. I'll leave the insurance      decision up to you.    </p>    <p>      And my final sage words are, <em>stay</em> <em>with it</em>      ! It'll take some time for people to gain confidence in      your operation and begin buying from you regularly. In the      meantime, even though your income may be only a fraction of      what it will later become, you'll have to keep right on      hauling wood, buying fish, cleaning the critters, carrying      away garbage, manning the smoker, calling on customers,      etc. Don't let that initial breaking-in period discourage      you. I happen to know that, if you put out a good product,      this little do-it-yourself business can support several      people comfortably. Be enthusiastic! Keep plugging away!    </p>    <p>      I'm not here to tell you that being self-employed is easy.      But take it from me (and I've lived both ways), I'd much      rather be smoking fish in my own little enterprise than      working myself into an early heart attack while doing      something I hate just to make money I don't need.    </p>    <p>      In short, if you want to be as independent as I now am ...      start smoking!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR 'S NOTE: This has been the second of a two-part      article. The first installment-in which the author      explained how to buy fish, build a smokehouse, price the      final product to the customer, and handle other details of      the business-appeared in MOTHER NO. 39.    </p>    <h3>      hickory smoked?    </h3>    <p>      We hear so much about "hickory smoked" these and those that      some folks think hickory is the only fuel that can be used      in the smoking process. This is simply not true, so don't      panic if you find that you have no source of hickory with      which to feed your oven.    </p>    <p>      What you want for your cure is smoke (and not necessarily,      as many people think, <em>hot</em> smoke) that will both      help preserve your fish and impart an appealing taste to      it.    </p>    <p>      This means that what you DON'T want are softwoods of any      kind. The wood from pine, cedar, hemlock, spruce-any      tree, in short, that doesn't shed its needles in the      fall-contains resins and pitch that both coat the      meat in a smoker without preserving it and add an      unpleasant taste to the fillets being cured.    </p>    <p>      What you DO want are hardwoods (trees that lose their      leaves every winter). Apple, ash, beech, birch, butternut,    </p>    <p>      cherry, chestnut, hickory, mangrove, maple, oak, sweet bay,      and walnut are all good ... as are almost any other      hardwood you can name. You can even work a pretty fair cure      with manzanita roots, trimmings from grapevines, and      corncobs if you have to.    </p>    <p>      Remember, though, that it's the smoke you're after more      than the heat when you build that first fire in your oven.      If the fuel burns too fast, dampen it with a little water.    </p>    <p>      You'll soon learn when to add wood to your firebox and how      much to put in at a time. (The design of your oven, the      type of wood you burn, the size of your logs, how heavily      you load the smoker, etc., will all affect the situation.)      In general, I add two four-inch-thick logs every hour      during the low-temperature phase of the cure and slightly      more fuel each hour after the temperature is raised.    </p>
