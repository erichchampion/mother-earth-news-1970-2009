                    <p>      You don't need an expensive cold frame or greenhouse in      which to grow plump, beautiful red-ripe tomatoes . . . over      an extended season. All you <em>really</em> need-says      Randy Sutton-are a few worn-out old tires and some      throwaway plastic clothes bags!    </p>        <p>      Getting a handle on the art of growing tomatoes can be      pretty difficult when you have to contend with wind, rain,      or a cool climate . . . and up here in Oregon's coastal      rain forest, we receive our share of all three.    </p>    <p>      Our neighbors, however, have devised a method for      successfully growing tomatoes in just such conditions. What      they do is use old rubber tires-obtained free from      service stations-and leftover plastic film (such as      dry cleaners put around clothes) to make a combination      greenhouse/wind protector that virtually ensures a bumper      crop every year. Here's their exact procedure:    </p>    <p>      First, in a sunny location, lay out one tire for each plant      you want to grow. Then, using a stick, scratch a line      around it in the dirt. Remove the tire and till compost or      fertilizer deeply into the soil inside the circle.    </p>    <p>      Next, scoop out a shallow tire-shaped depression (a couple      of inches deep) in the ground that you've tilled and      fertilized. Plant two or three seeds a half-inch deep in      the center of the circle. (If you're transplanting      seedlings, bury them up to the first set of leaves . . .      this'll permit each plant to send out feeder rootlets from      its stem.)    </p>    <p>      I might point out that weeds dearly love this gardening      system too, and that-for this reason-you'd do      well to mulch around your seeded area with cut-up inner      tubes, wood chips, tar paper, straw, or whatever mulching      materials you can scrounge for free.    </p>    <p>      Now. Place the tire around your planting so that it nestles      comfortably in the depression you've made for it. Then fill      the inside bottom of the rim to overflowing with water (but      be careful not to get too much on your plants or seeds).    </p>    <p>      Next, cover the tire with a big, clear piece of scrap      plastic, and tuck the edges of the film tightly under the      tire's bottom.    </p>    <p>      Finally, just scoop some soil firmly against the sides of      the wheel to help hold the plastic down and to provide      additional insulation. That's all there is to it.    </p>    <p>      What does the tire-and-plastic enclosure accomplish? Three      things. It serves as [1] a cutworm collar, [2] a windbreak,      and [3] a miniature solar greenhouse. During the day, the      black rubber absorbs heat from the sun's rays (even, to      some extent, when it's cloudy), and transfers that thermal      energy to the water inside the rubber doughnut's rim. At      night, the heated liquid then slowly releases its warmth to      the air surrounding the plant. Thus, conditions of      temperature and humidity (and pest exclusion) are      maintained which tend to foster rapid-and      healthy-plant growth.    </p>    <p>      You'll need to add little water to your "greenhouse" as      long as the plastic roof is covering the tire. Nonetheless,      do check the water level in the tire periodically and "top      off" the sidewall reservoir whenever it gets below half      full.    </p>    <p>      When your tomato seedling reaches the "roof", simply [A]      remove the plastic, [B] stack a second tire on top of the      first, and [C] put the plastic over the second tire      (tucking it between the two to secure the covering in      place).    </p>    <p>      It's probably a good idea to remove the plastic roof      altogether when blossoms begin to appear, so that bees can      get at them. Leave the two tires standing, however, to      serve as a windbreak.    </p>    <p>      Later on-as your tomato plant reaches its full size      and begins to bear fruit abundantly-you'll discover      that the double tire "trellis" holds the fruit off the      ground and thereby prevents rot.    </p>    <p>      So far, we've seen this method used only for tomatoes . . .      but it brings such fabulous results with <em>these</em>      plants that we plan to try the same idea for starting other      vegetables as well (green peppers and eggplant in      particular). Whitewalls, I would think, should produce      equally fine results . . . but-because an all-black      exterior will probably absorb more heat-we plan to      turn whitewalls dark side up, just to be safe.    </p>    <p>      Rubber tire tomatoes? See you in back of the service      station!    </p>
