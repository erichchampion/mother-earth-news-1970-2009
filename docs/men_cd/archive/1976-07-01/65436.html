                    <h5 id="byline">      by Jean W. Lyon    </h5>        <p>      Jean W. Lyon Some good things come in small quantities . .      . such as the parsley served alongside meat dishes and on      casseroles. Few people realize that the intensely green      sprigs are a storehouse of iron and vitamin C, and can      contain as much as <em>30,000</em> <em>international units      of vitamin A per ounce</em> (making them among the richest      known sources of that nutrient).    </p>    <p>      Parsley, of course, also has quite another culinary value      that's even more important than its nutritional value      (since few of us ever eat enough of the plant to "cash in"      on its vitamin and mineral content). The dainty      herb-a member of the carrot family cultivated by man      since the time of the Romans-is a real eye-catcher      (especially during the gray days of winter) when used to      garnish an otherwise ordinary dish. Its very appearance on      a plate, in short, can turn the commonplace into the      exotic. And that, in turn, often stimulates the most jaded      appetite, starts the gastric juices flowing, and serves as      a positive aid to digestion. Nor should we forget that the      herb can add a savory spiciness to otherwise bland meals      when powdered or flaked into soups, stews, salads, etc.    </p>    <p>      Parsley is both hardy and adaptive and can be grown quite      easily in most soils and climates. Six to ten plants      generally will supply enough seasoning and salad,      casserole, and roast garnishes for the average family.    </p>    <p>      It's no chore to harvest a whole winter's supply of dried      parsley in the fall. Just cut small clusters of the rich      green sprigs from the plants, preheat an oven to 400Â°      F, place the vitamin-packed bits in the oven, turn it off .      . . and leave the clusters of parsley to dry overnight. You      can store this "cooking parsley" in a tight jar the next      morning.    </p>    <p>      Salad and garnish parsley also can be served "fresh" all      winter from a fall harvest, if you'll freeze serving-sized      sprigs of the plant in airtight plastic containers (such as      recycled oleo tubs). It's then a simple matter to remove as      many pieces as you want just before mealtime.    </p>    <p>      Then again, if you prefer <em>real</em> fresh parsley for      your winter garnishes, you can always pot a few of your      plants before the first nippy weather and bring them      inside. They should thrive enough to allow you to pick off      as many clusters of the herb's foliage as you like      throughout the winter. And when spring thaws the garden      patch once again, you should be able to transplant the      parsley plants back outside none the worse for wear. (Just      pick off any flower stems that appear in order to keep the      plants from going to seed.)    </p>
