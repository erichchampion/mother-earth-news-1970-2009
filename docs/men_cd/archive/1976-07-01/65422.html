                        <p>      "They laughed last spring when I spread 60 bales of spoiled      hay on my small (600 square feet) Connecticut garden," says      Harold J. Ettelt, "but they're not laughing now!"    </p>    <p>      Our house was built on the site of an old rock and gavel      quarry and, three years ago when we moved in, its backyard      was a sloping and crabgrass-infested semi-desert. I leveled      out the slope as best I could when I enlarged the      building's basement but, needless to say, the cobbley fill      that I spread on the yard didn't improve its fertility a      great deal. (Or at all!)    </p>    <p>      "What this backyard needs," I told myself, "is anything      organic that we can put our hands on." And-over the      next two years, by using the town dump as a leaf, grass      clipping, etc., supply depot and our Opel sedan for a      pickup-we man aged to turn a few inches of the      near-sterile dirt into a fairly good layer of topsoil. Good      enough, at any rate, to grow a reasonably respectable      garden.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately for that garden, however, my wife soon talked      me into building her some raised flowerbeds (beautiful,      stone-lined beds made with all the rocks and boulders I'd      dug out of the cellar and the backyard). And once those      beds were finished, they had to be filled with      <em>something.</em> And that "something" turned out to be      my vegetable patch's precious topsoil . . . all of it,      right down to the rocky clay underneath.    </p>    <p>      Well, I certainly didn't begrudge my better half that      fertile dirt because I knew that her flowers needed good      soil and that, once she'd planted her perennials, she      wouldn't be able to dig them up every year to add humus.      Besides, she likes flowers better than I like vegetables.      Still, there was no denying that her passion for blossoms      had moved my gardening right back to where I'd started. And      I was in no mood to spend two more years regaining the      ground (literally!) that I'd just lost.    </p>    <p>      I had almost given up hope of exercising my green thumb      when a listing in the <em>Pennysaver-</em> a local      advertising throwaway-saved the day. My postman, it      seemed, had just what I needed: 60 bales of old hay that he      wanted to sell at a reasonable price. I bought it all and      he delivered the "spoiled hay" ("organic mulching material"      to me) to my door.    </p>    <p>      Although I appreciated the delivery, I began to think it      had been a mistake when the mailman looked over my 70 X      100-foot lot. "You mean you're going to spread <em>all</em>      60 bales on this little place?" he asked.    </p>    <p>      "Well, no," I replied. "Actually I'm only going to mulch      about 600 square feet of garden space out back."    </p>    <p>      The postman, to say the least, was skeptical of my plans.      And when some of my neighbors saw all that organic material      stacked up in my drive and learned that I intended to put a      whole big bale of the hay on each 10 square feet of      vegetable patch, they were even more skeptical. A few, in      fact, busted right out laughing!    </p>    <p>      I took some of the edge off at least the fellow-next-door's      merriment by letting him pile my hay around his      chickenhouse. (The bales kept his flock cozy at the same      time that I regained the use of my driveway, so we both      came out ahead.) And I kinda stayed out of everyone else's      sight until winter blew itself away and I could get out      into the garden again.    </p>    <p>      And that's exactly where I was bright and early the      following spring. First I removed a two-inch layer of      rather lifeless soil from the 600-square-foot vegetable      patch. (This was very heavy work which was made no lighter      by the fact that I separated out the larger stones and      rocks-which were later used in a dry well-as I      went along.) I then divided each of the bales of hay into      quarters and laid the squares of compressed mulch side by      side over the whole garden. And finally, I respread the two      inches of dirt (that I had removed earlier) right over the      top of the thick mats of organic matter. This meant that my      vegetable plot's profile consisted of heavy, rocky, mineral      subsoil . . . covered by a dense eight-inch layer of hay .      . . and topped with two inches of heavy, not-so-rocky,      mineral subsoil. Some garden!    </p>    <p>      By May, when I had become quite anxious to push some seeds      into the ground, I was somewhat dismayed to find that the      plugs of hay-after a month and a half in the      earth-hadn't even begun to rot down. (Walking across      the treated area was like stepping on a mattress.) But I      pushed on regardless.    </p>    <p>      As supports for my anticipated tomato crop, I sunk several      eight-foot-long 2 X 4's, spaced only two feet apart, into      the ground. More 2 X 4's-these about three feet long      and 18 inches apart-were driven in as stakes for my      peppers. (I tend to crowd things a little since I have such      a small garden.)    </p>    <p>      Once again, I found myself running head-on into skepti      <em>cism. "No one</em> around here stakes tomatoes with 2 X      4's," I was told. And peppers don't grow large enough to      need staking at all!"    </p>    <p>      I allowed that, "It doesn't take any more effort to install      a large stake than it takes to put in a small one . . . yet      the big stake'll do the little one's job, <em>but not vice      versa</em> <em>."</em> My reasoning stifled the critics . .      . although I noticed that they continued to smile a little      around the edges.    </p>    <p>      Uncomposted hay or no, when May 15 rolled around I felt      that I just had to put something in the ground. So I set      out my tomato plants (Rutgers, Fantastic, Beefmaster) and      my peppers (Midway, Early Canada Bell) and some Red Rock      cabbage. I dug right through the two inches of soil and      partly set the plants in the hay underneath. (What else      could I do?)    </p>    <p>      So much for my started plants (I figured they'd simply have      to take their chances). But what about the <em>seeds</em> I      wanted to get into the ground? I was actually ashamed to      cover them with the pulverized rock that passes for soil in      my neighborhood . . . so I bought a bag of topsoil at the      five-and-ten and sprinkled its contents over my rows of      pea, spinach, lettuce, squash, and bean seeds. Then I got      what mulch I could find at the dump, spread it around over      my purchased topsoil . . . and waited to see what the      summer would bring.    </p>    <p>      Well, it's mid-August as I write this . . . and I'm not      waiting any longer. I'm eating!    </p>    <p>      Those tomato plants that I staked with 2 X 4's have grown      well past the six-foot mark (I'm now lacing them from stake      to stake to keep them off the ground). And their yield has      been fantastic! We're overrun with so many tomatoes that      we've been forced to can the juicy red fruit just to save      freezer space.    </p>    <p>      It's the same story with squash. In fact I finally ripped      out half the zucchinis after we'd frozen our      <em>sixtieth</em> quart (and I was beginning to think we'd      turn green if we ate any more of the vegetable fresh). And      the peppers! They've developed into fullfledged      <em>bushes.</em> (I actually had to restake them when they      outgrew their original "unnecessary" 2 X 4 supports), and      we're giving away a <em>lot</em> of peppers.    </p>    <p>      Most of the rest of the garden did just as well. We're      presently eating our second crop of beans and the third is      about to blossom where I pulled out the zucchini. Our peas      (Lincoln) grew into a miniature jungle in late spring and      I've just put in the fall crop. The red cabbage is      pleasingly compact, with heads weighing in at about five      pounds. Our lettuce (black seeded Simpson) inundated us in      the spring, the second planting is still feeding us      adequately (even though we've had a heat wave), and the      third sowing is just coming up. And talk about horseradish!      The roots I planted for my father-in-law are already over      three feet tall.    </p>    <p>      Our beets, carrots, and onions also did well but-to      tell the truth-we've had a few clunkers too. The      cauliflower, for instance, got big but did not head (the      story of my life).    </p>    <p>      And the spinach was tasty, but small (the other story of my      life). All in all, however, I certainly can't complain. The      harvest from our garden has been so bountiful that [1]      we've been forced to buy a brand-new vegetable cookbook,      [2] we're now making noticeably fewer trips to the      supermarket, and [3] we've been asked by friends and      neighbors-who, by the way, aren't laughing      anymore-to write down the "secrets" of our success.    </p>    <p>      Well maybe we were just lucky, but the only "secret" we      have is hay. Lots and lots of hay. It may never work again      the way that eight-inch-thick layer of hay worked this year      . . . but it certainly has worked this time around. For      sheer results from a first-year garden in "totally      worthless" soil, you'll have to go some-I      believe-to beat our "hay miracle    </p>
