                   <p>      <em>Pat Imig, her husband (Richard), and their three      children (a girl, 11, and two boys, 3 and 1) live on an      eight-acre mini-farm approximately 30 miles west of      Lincoln, Nebraska. "This is the heart of agribiz country,"      says Pat, "and it's almost impossible out here to find      information about the operation of a small farmstead. We      had to learn the hard way how to make just a few hogs pay      all the day-to-day expenses of our shirttail farming      enterprise."</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And learn they did! The pigs that the Imigs market each      year bring in enough money-over and above their own      costs-to support a cow, two ponies, two to three      sheep, 14 geese, 30 ducks, 30 chickens, a big garden, a bed      of rhubarb, some mulberry trees, and a cherry, peach,      apple, and pear orchard.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Except for a few staples-coffee, flour, sugar,      etc-our little farm feeds us every bite we eat," Pat      says. "We butcher a hog and a calf each year, sat a lot of      geese, ducks, and chickens, have all the milk and eggs we      want, and make good use of the garden and orchard. We even      have a few eggs and some holiday geese left over to sell      ... and that miscellaneous cash income goes a long way      toward paying for the few staples we buy from town."</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To put it another way, the Imigs have all the same      expenses-a mortgage, taxes, fuel,      electricity-to cover with Richard's wages as a welder      that they'd have if they still lived in town. All the      expenses, that is, except food. And thanks to the hog      operation they run, their tiny farm keeps the Imig      refrigerator, freezer, and panse try filled with good      things to sat ... at no out-of-pocket expense at all.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"And besides that," says Pat, "we also get to enjoy the      luxury of living in the country!"</em>    </p>        <p>      Income! Income to provide adequate "store-bought" feed for      our livestock during the winter (when our pasture isn't      good enough to carry them) so that we wouldn't have to sell      our brood stock. Enough income directly from our eight-acre      mini-farm to cover all its upkeep, maintenance, and other      purely agricultural expenses. Enough <em>cash</em> income,      in short, to make the little spread entirely      self-perpetuating (over and above the rent or mortgage,      taxes, fuel, etc., that my husband's wages as a welder      would have to cover anyway if we'd stayed in town) ...      <em>and</em> , if possible, leave a "profit" in our pockets      of virtually every bite of meat, milk, eggs, vegetables,      fruit, and other food our five-member family could eat.      <em>That's</em> the kind of income we hoped our tiny      "estate" could provide for us.    </p>    <p>      In 1973-when my husband, Richard (a former farm boy),      and I moved to our little homestead in southeastern      Nebraska-we were determined to make the small spread      "self-sufficient". That is, we expected it to both pay all      the bills for its day-to-day operation (we couldn't afford      to support a "hobby" farm) ... plus feed our three children      and ourselves ... <em>plus</em> buy us the luxury of living      far from the crime, pollution, and crowds of a city.    </p>    <p>      That, as we soon learned, was easier said than done. Within      six short months we knew that we'd either have to come up      with a regular cash crop of some kind-and      pronto!-or kiss our dream of living in the country      goodbye.    </p>    <p>      Now, three years later, we're still "gettin' by" out here      on our eight acres thanks to one of the most traditional of      all small-spread "mortgage lifters": the prolific,      fast-growing, and efficient farmstead hog.    </p>    <h3>KNOW-HOW WAS HARD TO FIND</h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, none of today's agricultural "authorities"      seem able to believe that anyone would want to do what      we're now doing (profitably raise and market a      homestead-size herd of hogs). Most of the literature      currently available about pig farming assumes that its      reader has six degrees from an "ag" college and enormous      amounts of cash to invest in 1,000-head air-conditioned      farrowing barns and completely automated feedlots. The      "little guy" (us) has been largely forgotten ... and, when      occasionally remembered, is talked down to in generalities      that are, at best, vague and almost completely worthless.    </p>    <p>      We quickly discovered then, that if we intended to go into      a small-scale hog operation, we'd have to teach ourselves      most of what we needed to know to do it. So we did. And      now-after three years of breeding, raising, and      marketing a mini-herd of swine <em>for profit</em>      -we've summarized our experiences into our own      concise "A to Z Encyclopedia of Homestead Hog Production".      Perhaps a review of our present knowledge will help you      avoid some of the mistakes we've made during the past 36      months.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO SELECT A BREED</h3>    <p>      The accompanying table lists the seven most popular breeds      of swine now raised here in the United States.      Interestingly enough, though, most of the market hogs      currently produced in this country are crossbreeds that,      their herdsmen calculate, will achieve more efficient gains      in weight more economically than purebreds.    </p>    <p>      A good cross will, at least in theory, combine the best      qualities of several breeds. Our own small herd, for      instance, is made up of four sows (each a      Yorkshire-Hampshire-Duroc cross) and a purebred Duroc boar.      Although you may decide that you prefer an entirely      different cross (or that you want to raise only purebred      swine), we like our particular combination for the      following reasons: We feel that [1] the sows are, thanks to      their Yorkshire blood, more prolific and better mothers      than some others we've seen, [2] the cross contains just      enough "Hamp" to make their pigs satisfyingly chunky, and      [3] the bit of Duroc in the sows plus the 100% Duroc in the      boar produces litters that are both feed-efficient and      quite docile.    </p>    <h3>OUR MINI-HERD</h3>    <p>      We maintain a breeding herd of four sows and one boar and      farrow (deliver) two litters of pigs-one in the      spring and the second in the fall-per sow per year.      We pay very strict attention to our hogs and provide them      with the best living conditions we can afford. We do not      believe in sacrificing good care for the sake of a few      extra dollars' profit.    </p>    <h3>BREEDING</h3>    <p>      1. A gilt (young female hog) will first come into heat at      approximately six months of age. Thereafter, unless bred,      her heat cycle will regularly span a period of about 21      days.    </p>    <p>      2. Young gilts generally have a better lifetime litter      production record if they're not bred until they come into      their third heat (first breeding, in other words, should      not take place until a gilt is approximately eight months      old). It's unlikely that a gift's initial litter (even when      the animal is first bred at the age of eight, rather than      six, months) will be as large as her second and following      litters. Still, her chances of safely farrowing a medium to      large litter of healthy pigs is much greater at the more      advanced age. <em>You're wise to wait until a gilts third      heat before allowing your boar to breed her for the first      time.</em>    </p>    <p>      3. It's easy to tell when either a gilt or sow is in heat      (her vulva will redden and swell and she'll become      unusually restless). The acceptance period in gilts will      last about 24 to 36 hours and will span a period of from 36      to 48 hours in sows.    </p>    <p>      4. Never use a large boar to service a young gilt. His      weight during breeding can cause her serious and permanent      back damage.    </p>    <p>      5. We use "companion breeding" whenever possible to keep      later litter deaths to a minimum. The size of a litter can      vary a great deal from sow to sow and from farrowing to      farrowing.    </p>        <p>      Baby pigs develop a pecking order very quickly and the      smaller piglets in a big litter can be squeezed out and      will soon die if there's not enough good teats to go      around. If two or more gilts or sows are bred to farrow at      the same time, however, the "extra" pigs from an oversized      litter can be transferred to a mother with fewer babies. If      this is done within 72 hours of birth, neither sow will be      the wiser and you'll stand a good chance of successfully      raising a baby or two that might otherwise have been      crowded out.    </p>    <p>      6. Introduce the boar into your breeding herd ten days to      two weeks before the first female comes into her third      heat. Leave him with the gilts through the next complete      heat cycle (21 days) to ensure that he successfully breeds      all the females.    </p>    <p>      7. A well-cared-for sow can produce strong, healthy, and      large litters for four or more years.    </p>    <h3>GESTATION</h3>    <p>      1. A sow's gestation period is 112 to 115 days. Pay close      attention to breeding dates and maintain accurate records      for each of your mothers. Don't get caught by surprise      litters. Moving a nested or farrowed sow can be both      difficult and dangerous.    </p>    <h3>PREPARATION FOR FARROWING</h3>    <p>      1. Worm each sow and spray her for lice two weeks prior to      her farrowing. (Commercial worm medicines and lice sprays      are available from feed dealers.) Vaccinate each mother for      erysipelas (see COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS).    </p>    <p>      2. A puffy vulva and the accumulation of thick, yellow      fluid in the teats are good signs that a sow is approaching      delivery (look for these signals to become noticeable about      one week prior to farrowing).    </p>    <p>      3. Wash each sow with a mild detergent and warm water and      remove any plugs of dirt that she may have on the ends of      her teats immediately before you pen the animal for      delivery of her litter.    </p>    <p>      4. The sow should be penned from one week to three days      before she farrows so that shell have sufficient time to      adjust to her new surroundings and settle down before the      delivery.    </p>    <h3>THE FARROWING PEN</h3>    <p>      1. The big, automated "pig factories" fasten their      farrowing sows in "crates" that are so small the mothers      can't even turn around in them. This causes the animals a      great deal of nervous stress. As a result, the      sows-unless watched constantly-tend to lose too      many pigs when farrowed under such conditions.    </p>        <p>      2. On the other hand, it can be dangerous-to the      sows, their pigs, and to you-to allow your mothers to      farrow at random in a common lot. Under such conditions, a      boar and other sows (even the delivering mother) have been      known to eat the helpless piglets and-if      crowded-the other hogs will sometimes attack the      farrowing sow. Even if this does not happen, the delivering      mother and her babies probably will be unnecessarily      exposed to the elements and to various forms of infection.      Also, if complications develop during a farrowing in an      open lot, you may well have a great deal of difficulty in      "cornering" the delivering sow so that you can assist her.      And you may find yourself exposed to more risk than you'd      bargained for-from both the farrowing mother and the      other hogs in the lot-during that assistance.      <em>Trying to allow a domesticated sow to farrow "naturally      " in a barnyard (which is not at all like the deep forest      that wild hogs live in), then, can be just as misguided in      our opinion as allowing the animal to deliver in a pig      factory crate</em> .    </p>    <p>      3. We shut our sows up for delivery in a pen (see      accompanying drawings) that is large enough to allow the      mother some freedom of movement but small enough to make      her easy to watch, handle, and tend. Such a pen causes the      animal very little nervous stress. Still, we never confine      our mothers in even these enclosures without due      consideration of their need for both exercise and      cleanliness. We maintain a very conscientious schedule of      two exercise periods a day (which consists merely of      letting the sow walk around outside for 10 or 15 minutes      and eat her mixed feed while we clean her pen) for each      confined sow and we keep fresh bedding in all farrowing      pens at all times so that we won't unnecessarily expose our      mothers and their litters to infection.    </p>    <p>      4. Each farrowing sow should be given sufficient bedding to      allow her to obey her nesting instinct. Approximately two      inches of wheat straw is usually enough to cover even a      concrete floor. Too much increases the danger of the mother      lying on her pigs, while too little can expose the babies      to a cold floor, chilling, stress, and (quite possibly)      disease and death.    </p>    <h3>FARROWING</h3>    <p>      1. It is a MYTH that a sow with suckling pigs is like a      bitch dog with a litter of pups. The TRUTH <em>is</em> that      a sow is a domesticated animal BUT that she can in no way      be considered a pet. A mother hog almost surely outweighs      you, she can bite and tear you with unbelievable speed when      aroused, and she has a very strong and protective material      instinct. ALWAYS treat her with the respect she deserves      and NEVER try to handle her newborn pigs unless you're      absolutely certain that you have the upper hand in the      situation.    </p>    <p>      2. Delivery is different for each mother. Some sows go into      a trance during labor while others jump up after every pig      is born. Watch your farrowing sow closely. If she becomes      restless, hang a heat lamp above her-out of      reach-and put the newborn pigs in their hover under      another heat lamp (where they'll be both warm and safe from      trampling).    </p>    <p>      3. The actual delivery time will vary with each sow, but do      watch closely for prolonged delays between the births of      the pigs. As much as 30 minutes between deliveries can be      reason for concern. If a pig is left in the birth canal too      long, the result can be the death of that particular baby      <em>and</em> of the remaining unborn portion of the litter.      Be prepared, if necessary, to assist the sow by pulling a      pig.    </p>    <p>      4. If pulling does become unavoidable, use a medical      detergent to wash your hand and arm to the elbow before      entering the vagina. (A strong household detergent can      cause as much danger of infection as the use of no      detergent at all.) Then tuck the thumb under the fingers      and insert the washed hand slowly, palm down.    </p>    <p>      5. A sow's birth system, from the vaginal opening forward,      is shaped like a "Y" The animal's uterus is V-shaped and      pigs are delivered from either the left or the right side      into the common birth canal. (Don't worry. It's extremely      unlikely that you could accidentally reach beyond the canal      into either uterus.)    </p>    <p>      6. The pigs are delivered either head first or hind legs      first. Each is born in a sack, which can make pulling one      of the babies a rather slippery undertaking. If the pig's      head is presented first, grasp the back of its neck and      pull firmly and slowly. If you find the hind legs      presented, lock them between the index, middle, and ring      finger and-again-pull firmly and slowly,      <strong>CAUTION:</strong> Don't overreact, if you do find      it necessary to pull a pig. Give the sow sufficient time to      deliver the next baby normally before you convince yourself      that it must be pulled too.    </p>        <p>      7. It isn't necessary to cut the umbilical cord of a      freshly born pig. The cord has a naturally weak spot and      will come apart with a tug or two. Many vets recommend      treating the navel of the new baby with tamed iodine as a      precaution against infection.    </p>    <p>      8. The afterbirth may be expelled both during and following      delivery. Some herdsmen-feeling that it enriches the      milk-allow their sows to eat it (left to herself, the      sow will invariably do so). Others, as a matter of personal      choice, remove the afterbirth.    </p>    <p>      9. As a general rule of thumb, a sow will stay down from      four to six hours after farrowing. She may then be fed her      regular rations at the next scheduled feeding and increased      to full lactation rations over a three- or four-day period.      The mother should be fed twice a day during lactation (see      FEEDS AND FEEDING).    </p>    <p>      10. Keep fresh, clean water available to the mother at all      times. A first-litter gilt will consume four to five      gallons of water a day and a sow will drink from five to      six gallons.    </p>    <p>      11. A lactating sow can produce six to eight pounds of milk      per day. Be alert for signs of mastitis, metritis, and      agalactia (see COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS).    </p>        <h3>THE CARE OF BABY PIGS</h3>    <p>      1. A baby pig enters the world with a strong will to live      and a natural instinct to find food and warmth. But what      nature gave him in intelligence, she took back in      resistance. Baby pigs have very poor thermostats and a high      susceptibility to stress. I can't over-emphasize the need      for cleanliness and warmth during the first two weeks of a      piglet's life. Like all babies, he can become suddenly sick      without any advance warning. We watch our newborn litters      very carefully.    </p>    <p>      2. A pig usually weighs between three and three and a half      pounds at birth. Wipe the membrane from his mouth and dry      him well with a clean cloth (this will keep the risk of      chilling to a minimum). Then put the baby under the hover      and maintain its temperature at 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit      to assist him in making the transition from the sow's body      (which, remember, kept him at a temperature of 102 to 103      degrees).    </p>    <p>      3. Once the whole litter is born, dried off, and warmed, be      certain that all the baby pigs receive a share of the sow's      first milk. This will ensure a transfer of antibodies from      the mother-via colostrum-to her offspring.    </p>    <p>      4. Newborn pigs, although pinch-butted and wobbly, are      aggressive eaters. So aggressive that we think it's a good      idea to clip the tips from their needle or "eye" teeth at      birth to keep them from injuring their mother. The sharp      teeth are easily recognized because of their length and      should be cut-again, take only the very      tips-with a sharp, clean pair of wire cutters or nail      clippers.    </p>    <p>      5. Baby pigs are born anemic. It's the curse of the animal      and it can be corrected with an injection of 2 cc of a      commercial iron product. Some large herdsmen also douse      their 14-day-old pigs with an oral iron medication and feel      it gives the growing animals an extra boost.    </p>        <p>      6. Place a filled baby pig waterer in each hover when the      piglets are one week old and, three days later, give them a      creep feeder filled with pig starter.    </p>    <p>      7. Castrate all the boars in a litter (except for any that      you intend to save for breeding stock) when they're two      weeks old, and treat the wounds with tamed iodine.    </p>    <p>      8. Six-week-old pigs should be vaccinated for erysipelas      (see COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS).    </p>    <p>      9. We never ring our pigs ... since they never seem to root      a great deal.    </p>    <p>      10. There are a good many arguments about the subject of      weaning baby pigs. Some breeders take a litter away from      its mother when the babies are only three to five weeks      old. Others-less anxious to spend so much money on      commercial feeds-leave the pigs with a sow until      they're six to seven weeks old. A sow reaches her peak milk      production 21 days after farrowing and, at that time,      begins a natural 21-day decline back to zero milk output.      Forced lactation after the 42 days tends to drag her down      and weaken her health.    </p>    <p>      11. At the time that pigs are weaned, they should be      transferred into a nursery that allows a minimum of four      square feet per animal. From the day he's weaned (at      approximately 20 pounds) until he reaches a weight of 40      pounds, a shoat (young hog) is a very efficient converter      of food into meat. During this period he can gain as much      as one pound for every two pounds of feed he eats ... but,      once again, this rapid growth coupled with the recent shock      of weaning can put the animal in a highly stressed      condition. Careful attention should be given to the      sanitation and proper ventilation of such shoats to avoid      compounding the natural stress of this portion of their      lives.    </p>        <p>      12. Pigs thrown together in a large group quickly develop a      social pecking order. If litters of widely differing ages      are herded together or if access to feed and water is      limited, you may find it necessary to transfer the smaller      animals in your nursery to a second nursery (otherwise      they'll be crowded out at feeding time and their growth      stunted). Keep freechoice feed and clean, fresh water      available to every member of the herd at all times.    </p>    <h3>BOAR MANAGEMENT</h3>    <p>      1. A boar is responsible for 50% of the net worth of your      entire breeding stock. Individually, he passes the greatest      percentage of strengths and weaknesses to the offspring      and-therefore-should be selected with optimum      breed characteristics uppermost in your mind. (If the boar      you're considering doesn't exhibit good-even      great!-conformation, don't buy him!)    </p>    <p>      2. NEVER buy a boar that is too small or too large for the      sows he will breed. NEVER allow a boar to breed before he's      eight months old. And ALWAYS let a new boar have a 30-day      period of isolation in which to recover from the stress of      moving from his previous home.    </p>    <p>      3. Stress, as I keep emphasizing, can seriously affect a      hog's performance. In the case of a boar, seasonal      temperature extremes can decrease his fertility. So can      internal and external parasites. His sperm may not live      long enough to impregnate a sow if either animal is running      a fever at the time that breeding takes place. Try, in      short, to eliminate any and every condition that might      adversely affect your boar. A little pampering can pay      large dividends.    </p>    <p>      4. On the other hand, always bear in mind that-once      he reaches breeder age-a boar's breeding ability will      never increase. If yours throws small litters his first      year, hell always throw small litters. (A good general      measurement of a boar's ability can be made in a single      farrowing season. If all his litters are small, it's a good      bet that the boar is at fault. If-say-two out      of four litters are small and two are large, however, it      may well be half your sows that are at fault. And if all      the litters are big ones ... hooray!)    </p>    <h3>FEEDS AND FEEDING</h3>    <p>      1. Hogs will pasture but they cannot be raised entirely on      the grasses, clovers, and other such forage that will      fatten cattle, sheep, goats, and horses. Although swine      enjoy nibbling at and rooting up such plants, the animals      are basically grain eaters.    </p>    <p>      2. While the sophisticated feeding formulas used in "pig      factories" aren't really practical for the small homestead      herd, the application of a few simple rules of thumb in      this area can make your hog operation both more efficient      and more profitable. (In short, a mixture of corn, oats,      and commercial supplement is actually all you need to feed      either your boar or open, gestating, and lactating sows.)    </p>    <p>      3. Although it isn't necessary to <em>grind</em> the corn      you give your hogs, the animals will make more efficient      use of the grain if you feed it to them cracked instead of      whole.    </p>    <p>      4. Oats are a good feed for swine but should not make up      more than 50% of their basic ration.    </p>    <p>      5. While an open or gestating sow can be kept alive on just      three pounds of feed per day, most vets recommend a daily      five pounds of the grain-supplement mixture for open and      gestating gilts and ten pounds a day for lactating sows.      (In a five-pound feeding, the recommended ratio is three      pounds of cracked corn to one and a half pounds of oats to      one-half pound of 16% mineral supplement.) Work up to the      extra rations given during lactation by gradually      increasing a sow's feeding over a three-day period. Then      cut the sow back to five pounds of feed on the first day      that you wean her pigs.    </p>    <p>      6. Five pounds of feed (the same amount given to an open or      gestating gilt) is about the right amount of the      grain-supplement mix to offer a boar every day. Five pounds      of the rations will keep him growing at his natural rate      ... but isn't enough of the mix to make him fat and lazy.      Overfeeding a boar can decrease his fertility.    </p>    <p>      7. Always offer commercially prepared pig starter on a free      choice basis. At the time the creep-fed ration is first      offered in the hover (when the pigs are 10 days old), the      babies will only nose around in the feed, since they'll      still have a greater preference for their mother's milk.      Change the feed daily and gradually increase the amount you      offer, as the pigs demand it.    </p>    <p>      8. NEVER change feeds at weaning time. The pigs will be      going through enough stress anyway ... without the added      burden of adjusting to another feed.    </p>    <p>      9. A young pig will have consumed approximately 40 pounds      of feed by the time he reaches a weight of 40 pounds.    </p>    <p>      10. Finishing a 40-pound pig out to 220 pounds for market      will cost you about three pounds of feed for each one pound      of gain (or 540 pounds of grain and supplement for the      180-pound increase). Cracked corn and commercially prepared      supplement alone (in a 3-pounds-corn-to-1-pound-supplement      ratio) makes a satisfactory finishing ration. Or you can      buy a commercially prepared complete feed that will produce      the same results.    </p>    <p>      MARKETING    </p>    <p>      Since there are few demands for tri-crossed breeding stock,      all the pigs we raise are sold as market stock in one of      two stages of their development:    </p>    <p>      1. A pig is considered to be "feeder" sized when he reaches      a weight of 40 pounds. It's possible, at this stage of his      development, to sell the animal privately in a farm-to-farm      transaction ... or he can be sold through a livestock      auction barn. In either case, the feeder pig is sold on a      "per head" basis.    </p>        <p>      2. At 220 pounds, a hog is considered to have reached      "finished" or "market" weight. He can now be sold directly      to a slaughterhouse or through a livestock auction barn to      the highest bidder. Finished hogs are always sold on a "per      hundred weight" basis.    </p>    <h3>Pat Imig's Straight Talks on Farrowing and Baby Pig      Care</h3>    <p>      The method of farrowing and caring for baby pigs that I      describe in the accompanying article is by no means the      only one that can be used. For overall performance on the      small farmstead, however, we feel that the techniques we've      evolved over the past three years are hard to beat.    </p>    <p>      Caging a sow in a farrowing crate the way the "pig      factories" do (so that the animal can only lie, sit, or      stand in the same spot for six weeks) may be "necessary"      for such automated operations ... but we find it both      unkind and out of place on our small farm.    </p>    <p>      Richard and I have tried going to the opposite extreme and      allowing our sows to farrow in an open pasture. The pigs      born under such conditions did not do well at all. Though      they were delivered in the spring, the nights were cool      enough to chill the babies and subject them to unnecessary      stress. Furthermore, since the outdoor litters didn't have      access to the warmth and creep feeders that we could      provide only in an indoor hover, the pasture-farrowed      babies were completely dependent on their mothers for      support during the first few weeks of their lives. This      both put a greater strain on the outdoor sows and retarded      the weight gains of their litters.    </p>    <p>      Sanitation was also a tremendous problem with the pigs      reared in the pasture. The dirt which accumulated on the      sows' teats    </p>    <p>      between nursings opened the door to any number of      infections in the young pigs (we found that the same      problem existed when we tried farrowing confined sows      inside on an earthen floor).    </p>    <p>      Another "great" idea that we want nothing else to do with      is farrowing two sows in a single pen. The pigs favored the      mother with the most milk and mobbed her during nursing      periods. The resulting inactivity caused the second sow to      <em>lose</em> , rather than increase, her capacity to      produce milk. (We wound up feeding the double-litter a      powdered milk substitute, which was both expensive and      unsatisfactory.)    </p>    <p>      We've also tried turning our mothers and their pigs      communally out to pasture once the babies have passed      through their critical first two weeks of life. Suddenly      being dumped into this social situation only confused both      the sows and the pigs. The smaller babies in each litter      lost ground very rapidly and, in some cases, died from the      extra stress ... while even the stronger pigs were set back      as much as a week making the transition.    </p>    <p>      We now farrow our pigs in pens as described in the      article-with controlled sanitation, heat, feed,      water, and exercise-because bitter experience has      shown us that such a system of delivering and rearing the      animals consistently produces superior-and      profitable-results.    </p>    <h3>COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      Although our hogs are much healthier than my preoccupation      with "what can go wrong" might make it seem ... I would be      dishonest if I pretended that we <em>never</em> have a sick      pig. We do. I would also be dishonest if I pretended that      we're never forced to call in the vet to treat our hogs. We      sometimes are.    </p>    <p>      Still, I think I should point out that the methods we now      use in the management of our mini-herd of swine tends to      keep our health problems down to an irreducible minimum.      And, when illness <em>does</em> strike the animals, we find      that we're able to treat 95% of the ailments ourselves with      commercially available antibiotics.    </p>    <p>      Remember, then, that most of the small herdsman's hog      health problems are caused by the animals' natural      responses to the stress caused by mismanagement, farrowing,      and sudden changes in the weather. Guard against these      causes of stress, and you'll be able to avoid much of the      sickness that might otherwise plague your pigs.    </p>    <p>      And, the first time you <em>do</em> run up against an      illness in your herd, perhaps a quick glance over the      following chart will help you identify the ailment and      prescribe an appropriate treatment. (While not exhaustive,      the chart does briefly run down the afflictions that are      most likely to strike your hogs.) <em>Remember too: It's      always a good idea to consult your veterinarian</em>      - <em>immediately!</em> - <em>for help in any      situation that you can't properly identify or handle.</em>    </p>		    <p>      <strong>Pat Imigs Straight Talk on COST ANALYSIS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The following figures are based on a conservative      three-year trend in prices on both the Kansas City Grain      Market and the Omaha Livestock Market. They do not contain      any information on local market fluctuations and are based      on the assumption that all variables remain constant from      gestation through final sale.    </p>    <p>      PAT IMIGS STRAIGHT TALK IN MARKETING    </p>    <p>      It isn't impossible for a small farmer to finish out his      own feeder pigs to market size ... but the economics of the      necessary five-to-six-month investment make it a little      impractical. The gain ratio I quoted in the accompanying      article (one pound of gain for every three pounds of      grain/supplement fed) is an ideal calculated for confined      animals. And the average small farm can't afford to make      the investment in sophisticated sanitation facilities that      such confinement requires.    </p>    <p>      Richard and I tried finishing out one season's farrowing      ... and when we weren't struggling to keep infection down,      we were battling to find the money we needed for the      purchase of the animals' feed. For obvious reasons, we      don't recommend finishing hogs out to 220 pounds on a small      farm.    </p>    <p>      The folks who study such things calculate the statistical      break-even point in a farrowing operation to be the sixth      pig per litter that is raised to 40 pounds. They also      figure, on a national average, that a fraction over seven      pigs per litter are raised to that magical 40-pound weight.    </p>    <p>      The odds, then, are just barely in your favor when you go      into the hog business. If you expect to make any real money      with the enterprise, you're going to have to do it with      good management. And you're going to have to enter hog      farming with your eyes open and with a commitment to riding      out market peaks and valleys with consistent production.      (There are too many variables in the hog business for it      ever to be a quick way to make a fortune.)    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, the situation is not necessarily as      bleak as those "average" statistics paint it. For today,      those figures are largely based on the big commercial "pig      factories" . . . where the animals are closely confined,      conception rates are low, and overhead is high.    </p>    <p>      To put it another way, we've found that-by raising      just eight litters a year (two litters each from only four      sows)-we're already way ahead of those "average"      statistics quoted above. Since our pigs don't have to fight      the stress of automated confinement, both their conception      rate and their live-pig-per-litter average is higher than      that of the breeding stock in the pig factories.    </p>    <p>      As a result, we operate with a much lower mortality rate      among our animals and with a much higher profit margin.      And, thanks to that profit, our little eight-acre farm's      operation is able to pay its own way throughout the year      ... buy our family the freedom of living in the country . .      . and put almost every bite on the table (free!) that the      five of us can eat.    </p>
