                <p>      Nearly everyone, it seems, now wants to recapture some of      the joys and values of "the food old days". Here's how one      Wisconsin family satisfies that desire.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by BARBARA HOUGHTON    </h5>        <p>      I grew up on a 127-acre farm and, for that reason, the      little 1/7-acre field next to our house sometimes seems      pathetically small to me. Even though it is tiny, however,      that plot of earth plays an important role in my family's      life. For it's there that we (my husband, myself, and our      three children) raise our year's supply of wheat!    </p>    <p>      The ritual begins at the end of each summer when we haul      buckets and barrow loads of manure from the neighboring cow      pasture to our mini-field. Along with some old henhouse      bedding (generously donated by a nearby chicken farmer), we      spread the fertilizer on the ground . . . and then wait      eight or nine months for the rich nutrients to percolate      down into the soil. By the following May, we're ready to      sow wheat.    </p>            <p>      The first time we planted, we did it by hand . . . which      meant throwing out big, sweeping fistfuls of grain (and      trying afterwards-with little success-to even      up the seeds' distribution with a rake). Since then, we've      mechanized. Now-with the aid of a wooden, hand-operated      broadcaster-one of us can simply walk back and forth      across the field and (by turning a crank) scatter seeds      evenly on its surface.    </p>    <p>      And that's the signal for the beginning of a race between      us and the birds: We must cover the little grains of wheat      before the feathered robbers can eat them! (To speed this      part of the job we do use a rototiller but, no matter how      mechanized we get, we'll never resort to chemical      fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides.)    </p>    <p>      Next comes the hard part. The three months of waiting . . .      and waiting. We cast an expectant eye at the field each      time we walk by on the way to the mailbox or the school      bus. We <em>peer</em> at that seemingly lifeless soil. We      squint and we stare at that dirt. And then-at      last-the Big Day arrives when one of us announces,      "The wheat is up!"    </p>    <p>      Those four magic words transform us, during the followi ng      weeks, into miniature copies of "real" wheat farmers. We      critically analyze the ratio of weeds to our developing      crop. We speculate about whether or not it'll be a bad year      for grasshoppers. We take our farming as seriously as if      our livelihood depended upon it.    </p>    <p>      With August comes the hot, dry days and nights that are so      essential to the ripening of wheat here in Wisconsin. These      are the days when we can stand and almost watch the plump      heads of grain turn golden brown under the sun's scorching      rays. (When the air is still, you can-if you listen      closely-hear faint noises as the heads dry.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, the kernels of wheat have ripened to the point      where-if you bite down on them-they'll crunch      between your teeth. It's "thrashin' " time.    </p>    <p>      We encourage all able-bodied family members to join in the      harvest, which means-usually-that we have a      work crew consisting of two willing parents and three      reluctant children. ("Never mind their protests," we tell      ourselves. "Their memories will be rich.")    </p>    <p>      As strange as it may seem to "real" farmers, we don't      harvest our wheat with a combine. (The patch is too small      and, anyway, when we tried a combine once our grain was      presented to us liberally mixed with weed seeds, stones,      and dismembered insects.) Nor do we cut the stalks of wheat      with a scythe, sickle, or cradle (a scythe fitted with a      light frame that makes whatever is being cut lie down      evenly).    </p>    <p>      What we do is we each take a cardboard box out into our      mini-field and we <em>hand pick</em> the heads of wheat      right off their stalks. This doesn't take as long as you      might think . . . and it leaves all the weed seeds,      pebbles, and random pieces of grasshopper back in the field      where they belong.    </p>    <p>      After the wheat is picked, it, of course, must be threshed.      We like to spread a clean sheet on the garage floor, lay      out the heads we've gathered on the linen, and then shatter      them by beating the heads with a bamboo rod or an old      broomstick. Striking the wheat repeatedly and forcefully is      a grand way to work off pent-up frustrations, as more than      one guest has discovered. (We often invite friends and      relatives to share in the fun.)    </p>    <p>      Next, it's time to winnow out the grain. We wait for a      special sort of day to winnow . . . a day with just a      little-but not too much-wind. One of us then      carries the shattered heads of wheat up a ladder to the      porch roof, while the others spread a sheet on the ground      below. Then-carefully, in such a way that the chaff      catches the wind (while the grain doesn't!)-the      threshings are poured down onto the sheet. The process is      repeated until the nuggets of grain that we catch on the      ground are almost entirely free of broken stems and seed      husks.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, this primitive technique isn't 100% efficient:      some wheat is carried downwind with the chaff (to be eaten      shortly thereafter by a circle of waiting birds) . . . and      a certain irreducible amount of debris remains with the      grain. No problem. Whenever I go to a meeting or a friend's      house I just take along a tin of wheat (in place of      knitting) and spend my idle time picking out the bits of      chaff left in the wheat.    </p>    <p>      After this "final cleaning", the grain is ground in our      electric mill or cracked in a handcranked grinder. And what      delicious breads, what hearty cereals our      home-grown-and-ground wheat makes! Each toothsome mouthful      is rich in nutrition . . . and steeped in memories.      Memories of blistering sun and soothing rain . . . of green      waves undulating in the wind . . . of the feel in your palm      of golden wisps of crackling-dry grain . . . and of the joy      of family closeness in a common task.    </p>    <p>      These are the aspects of "the good old days" that seem to      us to be worth recapturing. And-thanks to our tiny,      1/7-acre patch of wheat-we <em>do</em> recapture      them.    </p>
