                    <h5 id="byline">      by Peter Ditzel    </h5>        <p>      Ever since the late Euell Gibbons' first      book-Stalking the Wild Asparagus-came off the      press in 1962, more and more people have taken to the      backwoods to forage everything from Jerusalem artichokes to      wild wintergreen. Surprisingly enough, however, <em>it's      not at all necessary</em> to hike hither and yon to start      reaping nature's bountiful harvest of volunteer vegetables.      Fact is, you needn't took further than your own backyard      (in most cases) to find plenty of free eats.    </p>    <p>      I was made aware of this simple truth one day      when-after hours of hoeing and pulling-I hauled      a wheelbarrow full of stout, leafy weeds away from my      garden.    </p>    <p>      "Hey there!" my Latvian-born neighbor called from his yard.      "Where're you going with all those plants?"    </p>    <p>      "To the trash bin."    </p>    <p>      "But that whole barrow load is good to eat!" the man      declared. "    </p>    <p>      <em>Good to eat</em> ?"    </p>    <p>      "Yes. In the old country, we used the leaves as soup      greens."    </p>    <p>      My neighbor didn't know the plant's English name, nor did      I. But a little research soon taught me that the      persistent, branching "weed" I'd just uprooted from the      vegetable patch in bushel quantities was actually      lamb's-quarters . . . a delicious green I've since come to      savor as much as any cultivated plant in the garden.    </p>    <p>      Since that incident, I've gone on to discover an array of      tasty vegetables in my backyard which-until      recently-i didn't even know were there! And the nice      thing about these free eats is that they require no      fertilizer or special care . . . and they grow without my      having to sow a single seed. (Naturally . . . they're      weeds!)    </p>    <p>      Chances are, your backyard, lawn, or garden is well stocked      with these free edibles too. So come with me, and I'll show      you how to find-and prepare-some of the more      common species of "good to eat" weeds.    </p>        <h3>      LAMB'S-QUARTERS (Chenopodium album)    </h3>    <p>      Lamb's-quarters-also known as pigweed, goosefoot, and      wild spinach-is a relative of spinach and one of the      most widely distributed plants on earth. In years gone by,      both Europeans and American Indians cultivated this leafy      annual for its abundant yield of seeds (seeds      which-incidentally-contain an average of 16%      protein, compared to wheat's 14%).    </p>    <p>      As a green, however, lamb's-quarters is delicious. And      surprisingly nutritious . . . for the uncooked plant      happens to be richer in iron, protein, and vitamin B 2 than      either raw cabbage <em>or</em> raw spinach.    </p>    <p>      Mature lamb's-quarters stands two to seven feet tall and      can be identified by its jagged-edged, diamond-shaped      leaves . . . leaves which-on their      undersides-are powdered with coarse, whitish      particles (hence the Latin name album, or "white"). The      short leafstalks may either be reddish-streaked or plain      green. (Both the stem and leaves of young plants are      usually just mealy white.)    </p>    <p>      While only the tender, growing tips of mature      <em>Cheno</em> <em>podium album</em> are mild enough to      eat, every part of the plant from the ground up is tasty      when taken from lamb's-quarters less than a foot tall.    </p>    <p>      Some folks like to use this green in salads, but I prefer      mine cooked as a substitute for spinach. (It's especially      delectable when creamed, I might add.) Lamb's-quarters is      also quite toothsome when wilted in hot dressing, as      follows:    </p>    <p>      Fry one small, diced onion in 1/2 cup of salad oil. Then      (after first checking to make sure the oil isn't hot enough      to "splash") add 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt,      and-if desired-pepper to the frying pan. Throw      in four cups of lamb's-quarters, stir-fry until limp . . .      and eat with pleasure.    </p>    <p>      Once you've tried <em>Chenopodium album-</em> either      cooked or raw-you'll know why pigs chomp happily away      on all of this weed that they can sink a tooth into!    </p>    <h3>      GREEN AMARANTH (Amaranthus retroflexus)    </h3>    <p>      A milder-tasting relative of lamb's-quarters that can be      prepared in the same manner is green amaranth . . . also      known as redroot, wild beet, and (coincidentally) pigweed.      Euell Gibbons has labeled this hardy native of tropical      America "among the most common of all weeds".    </p>    <p>      You'll recognize green amaranth by three main features: [1]      a stout, hairy stem, [2] rough-to-the-touch, pointed oval      leaves borne on stalks almost as long as the leaves      themselves, and [3] a crimson-colored root (hence the names      red root and wild beet). The height of the plant varies.      I've personally harvested a six-footer with a stem thicker      than some baseball bats! Usually, however, the mature plant      grows no more than three feet tall.    </p>    <p>      While some authors suggest ways of preparing <em>raw</em>      amaranth leaves, I recommend that you only eat the leaves      after they've been <em>cooked,</em> due to the fact that      the foliage contains a substance called saponin. Used      commercially as a foaming agent in fire extinguishers,      beers, etc., saponin gives the raw leaves of green amaranth      an odd taste and-because of its detergent-like      properties-can cause digestive upsets.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, brief cooking will serve to [1] drive saponin      out of the plant's leaves, and [2] create a vitamin-rich      vegetable side dish that's sure to please the most      fastidious palate. (Because the plain, cooked greens have a      very delicate flavor, you may wish to serve them with a      stronger-tasting vegetable-such as curled      dock-or with a cheese sauce.)    </p>    <p>      Boiled, wilted, fried, creamed, or steamed . . . green      amaranth is an uncommonly delicious "find".    </p>    <h3>      PURSLANE (Portulaca oleracea)    </h3>    <p>      If you want a weed that you <em>can</em> safely eat raw,      try purslane.    </p>    <p>      A native of southern Asia, <em>pussley</em> -as some      folks call it-is at present widely cultivated      throughout Europe and the Orient for use as a salad green      and potherb. In America, however, relatively few gardeners      have discovered how tasty-and nourishing-this      small, ground-hugging plant can be.</p><p>Although purslane      rarely grows taller than two inches, it can-and      will!-quickly spread its fleshy, reddish-purple stems      and paddle-shaped leaves over a large portion of one's      garden. Which is probably just as well, since all      above-ground parts of this iron- and calcium-rich      semi-succulent are edible. (Harvest only the tender,      growing tips, though, if you want to keep your purslane      productive all summer long.)    </p>    <p>      The leaves or tips add a welcome and slightly acidic flavor      to salads. In addition, the foliage is delectable either      boiled or fried in butter with salt or pepper.    </p>    <p>      The texture of purslane is somewhat gooey or mucilaginous.      If you find this disagreeable, try [1] dipping the plant In      a beaten egg, [2] rolling it in a mixture of bread crumbs      and flour, and then [3] frying the vegetable until it's      brown. The glutinous quality of the leaves is rendered      unnoticeable by the procedure. (I should add that this same      "gooey" quality makes pussley a good substitute for okra in      soups, sauces, and most any recipe calling for a      thickener.)    </p>    <p>      You may wish to take advantage of purslane's rich yield of      seeds-up to 50,000 per individual plant-for use      in breads, biscuits, pancakes, etc. To collect the seeds,      simply pick some plants before their pods have fully      ripened, lay them out to dry for two weeks on a sheet of      plastic film, thrash the dried pussley,      and-finally-winnow out the myriad tiny, black      seeds.    </p>    <h3>      CURLED DOCK (Rumex crispus)    </h3>    <p>      The docks are some of the hardiest, most widespread, most      <em>persistent</em> weeds found anywhere. (Pull one out of      the ground-if you can!- and you'll soon find      that it's been replaced by two more.) And docks <em>are      found</em> practically anywhere: alongside streams and      roads and driveways, in pastures and vacant lots and      gardens . . . in short, wherever you'd expect a weed to      grow!    </p>    <p>      Of the 15 <em>Rumex</em> species called docks, all are      edible. None, however, is as well known-or as      savory-as curled dock (synonyms: narrow-leaved dock      and yellow dock). The plant's name refers to the fact that      its slender, lance-shaped leaves-most of which sprout      directly from the ground-have wavy edges. Often,      these leaves reach two feet or more in length . . . while      the weed's spindly flower stalks grow to a height of four      or five feet before they bear small, green blossoms.    </p>    <p>      Curled dock's glossy foliage is unusually flavorful ...      often (especially if the leaves are more than a foot long)      to the point of tasting bitter. There are two ways of      dealing with this unpalatable pungency.    </p>    <p>      The first is to boil the plant through two waters. (In      other words, place the leaves in cold water in a pan, bring      to a boil, drain the hot water off, and-after adding      more liquid to the container-cook the foliage until      it's tender.) Yes, by doing this you <em>are</em> pouring      valuable vitamins down the drain . . . but the steaminghot      greens that remain in the pan are-in my      estimation-among the best-tasting of all wild      vegetables. As a result, I make up for the lost nutrients      by eating more leaves than I would if they tasted bitter!    </p>    <p>      A second effective way to rid dock leaves of their      astringency is to cream them. To do this, simply [1] mix a      tablespoon of flour with a tablespoon of melted butter in a      pan, [2] add two cups of chopped dock leaves and 1/2 cup of      milk to the butter-flour paste, and [3] cook-stirring      constantly-until the sauce thickens. The result: a      gourmet's delight, without the "bite".    </p>    <h3>      SHEEP SORREL (Rumex acetosella)    </h3>    <p>      A close relative of curled dock-and a frequent      inhabitant of neglected gardens-is <em>sheep      sorrel</em> (also known as sourgrass).    </p>    <p>      While it's true that the light-green, arrowhead-shaped      leaves of sourgrass <em>are</em> a bit acid-tasting (due to      the presence of potassium oxalate) and shouldn't be eaten      in excess . . . don't let this keep you from upping the      "zip factor" of your salads, soups, and other dishes with      small amounts of sheep sorrel foliage. (Place a few leaves      of <em>acetosella-</em> literally <em>,</em> "small      vinegar plant"-in a salad and you can omit the      vinegar from your dressing!)    </p>    <p>      Sheep sorrel's crisp tartness makes it the perfect      accompaniment to fish. Verify this for yourself by      including some chopped sourgrass leaves in your favorite      seafood sauce . . . or-the next time you bake a      whole, stuffed fish-add a small quantity of sorrel to      the stuffing mix.    </p>    <p>      Sheep sorrel also may be substituted for rhubarb in pie      recipes. All you have to do is cook the sorrel leaves,      combine them with the remaining recipe ingredients, and      pour the resulting mixture into a pie shell. Then top with      a layer of crust, pop the whole thing into the oven, and      bake according to the recipe's directions.    </p>    <p>      Another sheep sorrel dish-puree-goes back many      years. The dateless instructions I use say to [1] boil      three pounds (quite a sackful!) of the leaves until tender,      [2] drain them, [3] press the cooked foliage through a      sieve (if you have a blender, simply whiz the leaves-with a      little water, if necessary-until they're smooth), [4] pour      the pureed greens into a saucepan containing two      tablespoons of butter, and [5] simmer-while      stirring-for 10 minutes. Finally, add more butter-or      milk or cream-as desired, and salt and pepper to      taste.    </p>    <h3>      WOOD SORREL<em>(Oxalis acetosella</em> and other species)    </h3>    <p>      This fragile plant-held by some to be a descendant of      the original shamrock-grows in shady areas alongside      houses and fences, and can be recognized by its familiar      triple-lobed, clover-shaped leaves. (Unlike clover,      however, the lobes of wood sorrel's leaves are      heart-shaped.) Most of the dozen species of <em>Oxalis</em>      known as "wood sorrel" bear yellow flowers (see photo),      while some have white blossoms and others have violet- or      pink-petaled blooms. Regardless of the species, the pointed      seedpods of wood sorrel are always good for a refreshing,      lemony nibble on a hot summer day.    </p>    <p>      Wood sorrel (as you might expect from the name "sorrel",      meaning "sour") is similar in taste to sheep sorrel . . .      thus, you can replace one plant with the other in many      recipes. However, because the wood sorrel's stem can be      stiff and hard to chew-even after cooking-you'd      be well advised to harvest only the leaves from Oxalis      species.    </p>    <p>      You'll find that raw wood sorrel leaves add a delightful      flavor to sandwiches, and that the shamrock-like foliage      makes a decorative and tasty garnish.    </p>    <h3>      FOOD IS WHERE YOU FIND IT    </h3>    <p>      You can use any of the plants described in this      article-alone or mixed-as soup greens or the      base for a puree. And it's no chore to store the wild      edibles for year-round use: All you have to do is [1]      blanch the greens by placing them in a small amount of      boiling water for two minutes, [2] cool the foliage quickly      in pre-chilled water, and [3] pack the victuals into      airtight containers before [4] putting them in the freezer.    </p>    <p>      Give lamb's-quarters or redroot or purslane or curled dock      or either of the sorrels described here a try. (Add an      extra measure of nutrition to your meals and watch your      grocery bill go down at the same time!) I think you'll find      that it makes good sense to stop thinking of garden weeds      as ornery pests and begin accepting them for what they (in      many cases) really are: no-work, natural,      free-for-the-pickin' <em>food.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Five commandments for the novice weed stalker    </h3>    <p>      [1] DON'T <em>ever</em> put a plant to your lips or tongue      until you've positively identified-and determined the      edibility of-the weed in question with the aid of a      guidebook or an experienced forager. When in doubt, take      the plant to your county agricultural agent for      identification.    </p>    <p>      [2] DON'T depentd on general rules of thumb (regarding      color, shape, milky sap, etc.) to determine a plant's      edibility or non-edibility.    </p>    <p>      [3] DON'T pick wild food from areas that might have been      sprayed with herbicides, pesticides, or chemicals not meant      for use on edible vegetables. (Hint: Wash whatever you eat      before you eat it.) .    </p>    <p>      [4] DON'T forage too close to roadways, where lead from      auto exhausts may have contaminated the soil to a dangerous      extent. Consider a 25-foot separation between plant and      highway to be a bare minimum, and try-if      possible-for 50 to 100 feet of separation.      (Similarly, don't forage in areas which are likely to      contain pollution . . . such as near factories, chemical      dumping grounds, or effluent-tainted waterways.)    </p>    <p>      [5] Finally, DON'T let the above warnings frighten you out      of experimenting with wild foods. Instead, remember that if      you [A] gather your foliage in a safe place and [B]      positively identify your plants, there's nothing to fear.      Become a weed stalker and you'll soon understand more about      the natural world than just which plants are edible. What      better way is there to become acquainted with Mother      Nature, than to eat from her hand?    </p>
