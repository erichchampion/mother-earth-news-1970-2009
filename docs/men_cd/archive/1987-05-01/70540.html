    <p>
                    <p>      Do-it-yourself auto maintenance can prevent vacation      breakdowns.    </p>    <p>      With summer just around the corner, it won't be long before      millions of Americans take to the highways in celebration      of their annual vacations. Unfortunately, many of those      travelers won't reach their destinations <em>w</em> ithout      suffering a mechanical mishap along the way.    </p>    <p>      A roadside breakdown is no joke, and you'll only be kidding      <em>yourself</em> if you leave your fate to chance. By      spending a Saturday afternoon checking commonly ignored      components on your car, you'll be one up when you take      those jaunts-or that special journey-you've been      looking forward to all year.    </p>    <p>      These preventive maintenance steps don't have to cost a      cent. Nor will they require a shopful of tools or the      expertise of a seasoned mechanic. In fact, each procedure      outlined below is one you can do yourself, even if all you      know about cars is how to lift the hood or change a tire. A      few essential tools will come in handy: adjustable      channel-locking pliers, flat- and Phillips-blade      screwdrivers, a utility knife and perhaps a seven-piece set      of combination or socket wrenches (3/8" through 3/4" or 9mm      through 19mm, metric). If you don't own any tools, consider      buying some to keep in the car. You just might need them on      the road someday.    </p>    <p>      It seems sensible to begin by opening the vehicle's hood .      . . but it makes even more sense to start by opening your      owner's manual to the section on service and scheduled      maintenance. There the manufacturer item izes service      procedures by mileage intervals and indicates fluid      capacities, oil and coolant requirements and a number of      other things specific to your car. The manual often      includes photos or illustrations that locate and detail      each maintenance chore clearly.    </p>    <h3>      Getting Down and Dirty    </h3>    <p>      Once you've familiarized yourself, at least in theory, with      the things that might need attention under the hood, it's      time to make your move. Don't count on keeping your clothes      clean; just wear something that can get stained. Remove any      watches or metal jewelry that can conduct electricity, and      dispense with belts or buckles that might scratch your      car's finish. Tie up your hair (or wear a hat) if it's long      enough to snag.    </p>    		<p>      B-WIPERS: Replace the blades if they're worn, and fill the      reservoir.    </p>    <p>      C-BRAKES: Look for leaks or kinks in the brake lines;      scraping or clinking noises should be checked.    </p>    <p>      D-SHOCKS: Worn shock absorbers cause your car to wallow and      bounce. Look for a service center sale.    </p>    <p>      E-TIRES: Tread wear can tell a story if you know what to      look for. If the rubber is in good shape, inflate the tires      to the recommended pressure.    </p>    <p>      F-LIGHTS: It only takes a few moments to check headlights,      taillights, etc.    </p>    <p>      G-EXHAUST: Get under the car and look for corrosion or      looseness in the pipe, muffler or clamp components.    </p>    <p>      Safety first? It's a good practice, so let's start there.      Turn on the headlights, and walk around the car to check      each bulb. Test the high beams and brake lights (with the      help of a friend). Try the turn signals and parking/side      marker lights, too. If a lamp is burned out, be sure to      replace it with one of the same type. To change a headlight      on most cars, first remove the trim door around it; then      loosen the lamp mounting screws, pull the bulb plug and put      in the new unit. <em>Don't</em> turn the longer headlight      alignment screws, or you'll need to re-aim the headlights.      The taillights are usually accessed through removable      panels in the trunk in modern cars. On older models, the      lenses unscrew from the outside.    </p>    <h3>      Blades, Breakers and Battery    </h3>    <p>      Inspect the wiper blades for splits and deterioration.      Replace them (by pinching the end clips together and      sliding the flat spine through the four sets of hooked      guides) if they're at all questionable. On some cars, you      may need to change the blade <em>and</em> its holder by      pressing the clip or button located at the end of the wiper      arm. Now's also the time to fill up the washer reservoir      with the recommended fluid and test the system.    </p>    <p>      Determine what type of fuses or breakers your electrical      system uses by referring to the owner's manual or checking      the fuse box beneath the driver's dashboard or on the      inside or outside fire wall panel. Purchase spare fuses to      match the three or four amperage ratings required. Check,      as well, the operation of your fuel gauge. If it's broken      or erratic, have it repaired before you travel.    </p>    <p>      Warm weather won't guarantee a troublefree battery. Time,      corrosion and poor maintenance take their toll in any      season. If there are deposits on the terminal posts and at      the top of the battery, wash the areas with a solution of      two tablespoons baking soda to one quart water. Is the      corrosion well entrenched? Loosen the cable clamps, remove      them from the posts with a cable puller or channel pliers,      then clean the posts and the inside of the clamps with a      small wire brush or a terminal tool. Don't hammer the      clamps in place when you reattach them, or you may ruin the      battery. If the cables have deteriorated and the wiring is      exposed, replace them. Check, too, the cable connections at      the engine block (or chassis) and at the starter solenoid.      They should both be tight and free of dirt. Coat the posts      and clamps with gasket sealer or petroleum jelly to inhibit      future corrosion.    </p>    <p>      Remove the filler caps at the top of the battery, and add      enough distilled water to cover the cell plates if they're      exposed. Inspect the battery hold-down clamps; tighten or      replace them if necessary.    </p>    <p>      While you're at it, take a look at the alternator drive      belt. The outer face may appear fine, but twist it slightly      to check the tapered sides. A healthy belt shouldn't be      cracked, shiny-smooth or flecked with oil stains. If you      must replace or tighten the belt, don't put excessive      pressure on the alternator housing, or you may distort it;      draw it firmly against the belt so there's about 1/2"      up-and-down deflection on the longest stretch.    </p>    <h3>      Filters and Breathers    </h3>    <p>      The air filter is one of the least expensive parts on your      car, yet one of the most ig nored. On a conventional      carbureted engine, it's located in the round housing above      the rest of the motor; fuel-injected models may house it in      a chamber off to one side. Replace the element if it's been      on the car for more than 24,000 miles (sooner, if you drive      under dusty conditions frequently). A good test is to shine      a light through the ribbed section from behind. It'll be      visible if the filter is OK. Check the gasket between the      filter housing and the carburetor, and the condition of the      corrugated hot air duct, as well.    </p>    		 <p>      DRIVE TRAIN: Worn universal or constant-velocity joints can      pose a hazard. Check for excessive play in the drive shaft.      More than a fraction of an inch is too much.    </p>    <p>      In-line fuel filters should also receive attention if      they're old. The kind threaded to the carburetor should be      removed with two wrenches, one to hold the carb nut and one      to unscrew the filter. You can pull canister types from the      line after you've loosened the hose clamps. Be sure to look      for a direction-of-flow arrow when you install the new      filter. (Fuel-injected engines have pressurized fuel      systems, so it's best to leave their filters to a      professional.)    </p>    <p>      The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve-located      within a rubber grommet on the air cleaner housing, valve      cover, intake manifold or oil filler cap-should rattle      freely when shaken. If it doesn't, replace it and the small      breather filter inside the housing or cap. Both parts      simply press into place. In the process, you can inspect      the neoprene ventilation hoses for kinks or tears.    </p>    <h3>      Lubricants and Fluids    </h3>    <p>      The biggest favor you can do your vehicle before a long      trip is to change its oil and filter. Use a box or socket      wrench to remove the crankcase plug in the oil pan, and let      the old oil drain into a leak-free container. Unscrew the      filter (you may need a strap wrench), and let it drain      there as well. Coat the new filter's rubber seal with clean      oil, then tighten the canister in place on the block using      <em>hand pressure only.</em> Replace the oil pan plug      (don't overtighten it), and fill the crankcase to the      capacity specified in the owner's manual.    </p>    <p>      Change the oil and filter; your car will almost smile.    </p>    <p>      Automatic transmissions use a high-detergent lubricant      specified by the manufacturer. Usually, the level is      checked when the car is idling and has reached initial      operating temperature. After setting the parking brake,      move the shift lever slowly through all the gear positions,      then back into park. Allow one more minute of idling, then      read the dipstick's "cold" side, if that's indicated. Add      fluid, if necessary, through the dipstick tube until it      reads correctly on the stick. Don't overfill or underfill:      Doing so will affect the transmission's performance.    </p>    <p>      The power steering system uses automatic transmission fluid      as well. Merely fill the reservoir if the cap stick shows      the level at "add." Keep the fluid level below the cold      mark if you check it cold; any extra fluid will just spew      out when the engine heats up.    </p>    <p>      Brake fluid must meet the Department of Transportation      standards indicated in the owner's manual. Check the      reservoir at the master cylinder located on the engine      compartment fire wall, and fill it to within 1/2" of the      top if needed. Be careful not to spill any fluid on      finished surfaces, because it removes paint instantly.    </p>    <p>      Unless you have the tools and experience to check the      differential and manual transmission fluid levels, it's      easier to let a mechanic do those jobs. But don't just      ignore these components, because they <em>can</em> leak and      are very costly to replace.    </p>    <h3>      Cooling System    </h3>    <p>      Overheated engines stop more summertime progress than      anything except flat tires; check your cooling system. For      starters, squeeze the radiator hoses. If they're unusually      stiff, they've probably been overheated. Soft and gooey?      Oil contamination. Or perhaps they've been physically      damaged by tight clamps or contact with a sharp corner.      Replace them-along with heater hoses, choke warming      lines and bypass elbows that show similar characteristics.      Be certain to clean all fittings thoroughly before      installing the new hoses, and always use new wormdrive      clamps rather than trying to reuse the old ones.    </p>    <p>      Now inspect the fan and water pump belt, using the same      criteria as those used for the alternator drive. Should you      need to replace the belt, test the water pump bearings by      grasping the fan blades or pump shaft and shaking the      assembly up and down while the belt is off. If you can      detect lateral movement of the shaft, the water pump may      need to be replaced, too. (Some cars have electrically      driven radiator fans, so disconnect their terminals while      testing, and concentrate on the pump shaft alone.)    </p>    <p>      Antifreeze no longer has that single wintertime function.      It's now generally called coolant, and its concentration      can be critical to pump lubrication and warm-weather      driving. If it's been two or more years since you changed      the coolant or the thermostat, consider taking your car to      a service station for a back-flush, thermostat change and      refill. Flushing kits are available to fit your garden hose      if you want to tackle the job yourself. Otherwise, do      without the cleaning, and at least top of the radiator (or      partially fill the small recovery reservoir on newer cars)      with a 50:50 mixture of coolant and water.    </p>    <p>      To drain the cooling system, bring the engine to operating      temperature, then open the petcock at the bottom of the      radiator or just remove the lower hose. Refill it with a      half-and-half blend, or refer to the chart on the coolant      container; it specifies the best mixture for your expected      temperatures. Run the engine while refilling the system,      and turn the heater on full to make sure the core fills      properly. Finally, inspect the radiator cap for      deterioration or leakage if it's the removable type, and      clean the radiator fins of bugs, leaves and other road      debris.    </p>    <h3>      Ignition Tune-up    </h3>    <p>      Modern cars equipped with electronic ignition go farther      between tune-ups and require fewer replacement parts than      older vehicles. But spark plugs and rotors do wear out      eventually, so you may want to check these parts if you      can't remember when they were last serviced. Carefully      remove one cable boot from a spark plug, and unscrew the      plug with a socket or plug wrench. (If you can't reach any      easily, defer to a professional.) Check the ignition end of      the plug for burned electrode tips, dark deposits or      wetness. If any of these are present, you'll need to spring      for a tune-up or diagnosis.    </p>    <p>      Next, remove the clips or screws from the plastic cap that      holds the ignition cables. Lift the cap to look at its      underside and the metaltipped rotor beneath it. If there's      any sign of arcing or burning, get these parts replaced.    </p>    <p>      Unless you're comfortable doing tune-ups on conventional      and electronic ignition systems, it's best to leave that      work to a mechanic. Breaker-point systems require detailed      adjustments, and electronic ignition parts can demand      special handling.    </p>    <h3>      Air Conditioning and Accessories    </h3>    <p>      Even though it requires a trained technician to service AC      systems, you can make some basic checks yourself. Examine      the belt for tightness and signs of wear. See if the      electric clutch kicks on when you slide the control lever      to the maximum cooling position. Inspect and tighten the      short copper ground cable on the compressor housing if one      is visible. With the exception of belt replacement and      screw tightening, any other woes are jobs for the pros.    </p>    <p>      Take a minute now to look at the belts that run the power      steering and the emission control air pumps. Replace them      if they're worn, and don't overtighten either one.    </p>    <h3>      Tires and Shock Absorbers    </h3>    <p>      Make this simple check: Push down sharply on the front      bumper, then on the rear one. If they return with a bounce      or don't rebound smoothly, your shocks are probably worn      out. You can replace them yourself for the cost of the      parts and several very dirty hours of your time. Or you can      have them replaced in about 20 minutes at a tire store and      pay about the same price if you catch a sale. Make your own      choice.    </p>    <p>      Tires play by the same rules. You should make a very      careful inspection of the tread and side walls. Wear in the      center of the tread or at the edges (over- and      underinflation), uneven wear (imbalance), bald strips      across the face of the tread (wear indicators exposed) or      badly bruised side walls (curb impact) are all good reasons      to have the cause of the prob lem corrected and new tires      installed if the damage is serious.    </p>    <p>      Switch radial tires front-to-back, never side-to-side.    </p>    <p>      If there are no obvious problems, consider rotating the      tires yourself, for two reasons: One, they'll wear more      evenly if swapped around. (Radial-ply tires must always      spin in the same direction, and thus must be switched      front-to-back, not side-to-side; biasply tires should be      changed diagonally rearto-front, and the front tires moved      straight to the rear.) Two, you'll learn through experience      how to operate the jack and tire tools, and you'll be      better able to loosen the lug nuts in an emergency if you,      rather than an impact tool, tightened them. Finish up by      inflating the tires, cold, to the pressures recommended by      the car manufacturer.    </p>    <h3>      Exhaust, Brake and Drive Parts    </h3>    <p>      At some point you're going to have to resign yourself to      getting under the car to complete your inspection. If you      can do it without jacking the vehicle in the air, great.      But you'll probably have to borrow jack stands or ramps to      gain access to the lowest parts. Always chock the wheels      that are still on the ground; never trust a jack alone.    </p>    <p>      First, examine the exhaust pipe, the muffler, the catalytic      converter (it's smaller) and the tailpipe for holes or rust      spots. Check the pipes for tightness and draw up on the      hanger clamps if needed. Be especially critical of the      gasket where the exhaust manifold joins the header pipe      (right at the engine).    </p>    <p>      Next, run your eyes along the path of the brake lines and      look for visible leaks. Check the fittings at the wheel      backing plates, too. Keep your eyes open for kinks or flat      spots in the lines. Trace the parking brake cables, and      lubricate them and the guide pulleys with silicone spray.    </p>    <p>      Finally, on rear-wheel-drive cars, check the universal      joints by rotating the drive shaft back and forth and      shaking it sideways. There should be no more than a      fraction of an inch of play besides what's offered by the      gear train. Any problems with these major systems should be      brought to the attention of a professional.    </p>    <h3>      Don't Leave Home Without . . .    </h3>    <p>      Tools, silver duct tape, a functional flashlight, a tire      pump, work clothing and a spare set of keys (to be carried      by another member of your family, not taped beneath your      car somewhere) will be blessings-if it turns out you      need them. If you don't, consider your self a great deal      luckier-or perhaps better prepared-than those      thousands of unhappy folks stopped at the side of the road      this summer.    </p>
