                    <h3></h3>    <p>      Want a slimmer dog or cat? Diet alone won't do it. By Randy      Kidd, D.V.M.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      ILLUSTRATIONS BY ANDREW SHACHAT    </h5>    <p>      Anyone with a dog or cat owes that animal the three      essentials of a decent life: comfortable shelter,      nutritious food and the opportunity (and, if necessary, the      motivation) to get adequate exercise.    </p> <h3>  The Benefits</h3>        <p>      There is, of course, an overwhelming body of scientific      evidence to support the notion that exercise is vital to      <em>human</em> wellness. Most veterinarians believe that      the same holds true for animals. Nearly all the documented      benefits of exercise for humans are also apparent in active      pets.    </p>    <p>      Mentally and emotionally, an exercising animal is      invariably better off-happier, more alert, more      content. Activity soothes life's many stresses. The      exerciser sleeps better, has more libido and is better      adjusted. In their book <em>Pet Aerobics</em> (Holt,      Rinehart and Winston, 1984), Warren and Fay Eckstein state      emphatically, "Nearly every behavior problem we have      encountered in our 14 years of work with animals is      directly attributable to lack of exercise." (The Eck steins      are professional animal trainers who have worked with more      than 20,000 pets.) Mentioned in the Ecksteins' list of      "ailments" that disappear after proper exercise are      furniture chewing, biting, car chasing, hole digging and      excessive barking.    </p>        <p>      Exercise keeps your pet lean and trim, too. There's simply      no other way to get-and keep-the lard off. I      used to tell clients with portly pets that diet was the key      (the same advice physicians would give overweight      patients). "This animal is grossly out of shape," I'd say,      pounding my fist on the exam table. "It's eating too many      groceries. Cut down on the vittles and it'll lose that      fat." Since then I've learned that dieting alone doesn't      work.    </p>    <p>      Decreased food intake is an important factor in losing      weight, but exercise is a necessary companion. An animal      (or human) loses only so much weight by dieting, and then      stops at a level known as a set point. Exercise, however,      lowers that set point, making it possible for Pooch to      become the svelte self he's meant to be. And because      creatures that exercise crave more nutritious foods and      metabolize them more efficiently, a weight-control regimen      of both reasonable diet <em>and</em> exercise can be      virtually self-sustaining.    </p>    <p>      Physically active animals also have stronger and healthier      bones, better muscle tone and fewer everyday ailments. Even      maladies unique to the species occur less often. I seldom      see canine hip dysplasia in a lean, active dog.      Well-exercised hips build up a protective muscle mass that      helps prevent dysplasia.    </p>  <h3> How and How Much</h3>    <p>      Cats, dogs and people all benefit most from aerobic      exercise-activities that are sufficiently demanding      to get and keep the lungs and heart pumping hard, but not      so hard that the exerciser has to stop just to catch a      breath. According to extensive research conducted by Dr.      Kenneth Cooper at the Aerobics Center in Dallas, Texas, the      most effective aerobic exercises for the human animal are      crosscountry skiing, swimming, jogging or running, outdoor      cycling and walking.    </p>        <p>      Unless you have an extraordinary pet, cycling and skiing      are probably out of the question, but most dogs (and many      cats) will walk or run with you.    </p>    <p>      Before you take that first step together, make sure that      your pet is on a leash; exercise won't hurt it, but cars      and other animals can. If your pet's a pooch, teach it to      heel and to stay by your side <em>always.</em> And      naturally, if your pet is particularly old or suffers from      any malady that might impair its capacity for exercise, get      your vet's advice first. (Don't neglect to have your doctor      check you out, too, particularly if you're not used to      vigorous activity.)    </p>    <p>      The key to effective aerobic exercise is to maintain a      regular program of long, gentle workouts. Neither you nor      your pet will get hurt if your sessions begin slowly and      gradually work up to a level you both can handle easily. As      a friend of mine says, "Start slow and then taper off."    </p>    <p>      In most cases, beginning workouts should consist of 15 to      20 minutes of easy walking. As you and your pet become      accustomed to the activity (this can take several      <em>weeks;</em> be patient), gradually increase the length      and intensity-first to brisk walking, then (if you're      both so inclined) to jogging or running. Promise your pet      you'll stick with a continuing program for at least 90 days      (this will give him or her time to begin to really      appreciate the workouts). Ultimately you'll want to give      your pet an aerobic workout for 20 to 30 minutes four or      five times a week.    </p>    <h3>With the aid of a little    ingenuity, you can even get a cat to      exercise.</h3>    <p>      How will you know it's a truly <em>aerobic</em> workout?      This will be difficult to determine for your pet; for you      it's easier. Your pulse rate should exceed approximately      140 beats per minute. Remember not to push yourself; if you      have trouble catching your breath, you're risking      injury-and not getting the benefits you're exercising      for. Animals have highly variable pulse rates, making it      hard to evaluate their aerobic state. So as you walk or jog      along with Rover or Kitty, keep track of your own pulse      rate, and you'll have a general idea when the two of you      are moving fast enough. All but the shortest-legged      critters will easily keep up with a gait that'll give you      both adequate aerobic exercise.    </p>        <p>      If you're going too fast or too far for your pet, it'll      show you a long, droopy tongue that may turn bluish if you      continue. Take a break and make tomorrow's workout shorter.      Remember also that in hot weather your pet can't sweat as      you do to keep cool. Be es pecially cautious during those      dog days of summer.    </p>    <p>      Not every pet, of course, is inclined to run or jog. (You      may not be either, for that matter.) If that's the case,      there are other ways you can encourage your animal into      activity. A dog accustomed to lazing around on the floor      all day may come alive with a good game of fetch the stick.      Even cats, although sometimes as single-minded as any      critters on earth, can usually be persuaded to revert to      the friskiness of their younger years. A cloth mouse tied      to a string and pulled around for the feline to chase may      do the trick. Or try encouraging Pussy to frolic by giving      it an occasional catnip treat. You might also consider      getting another. cat or dog to play with the one you have;      most animals become more active around other animals.    </p>    <p>      In any case, start your exercise program today. And make      every day's walk, jog or frolic a truly enjoyable play      period for both of you.    </p>
