                   <p>      <em>Save up your money, pile up your rocks and you'll      always have tobacco in the old tobacco box.</em>    </p>   <h3>-Vermont Proverb</h3>        <p>      Well sir, it's been a couple of months since you've had a      chance to read this feature, but I'm sure you still      recollect that the good fellas of the Plumtree Crossing      General Assembly are touring America by railroad, and I      know you remember that they're currently visiting Hiram      Bartlett, Ott's cousin who lives up in northern Vermont,      <em>and</em> there's no way you'd forget that, with the      help of a jug of Purvis Jacob's liquid tongue loosener,      Hiram's been regaling the boys by explaining why Vermonters      are standoffish to outsiders.    </p>    <p>      Hiram finished that lecture just as a late spring snowstorm      ("poor man's fertilizer," Hiram called it) began to cut      loose. There didn't seem any point in getting up from the      farmhouse woodstove. To pass the time, Ott spoke up.      "Hiram," he said, "you may not come from friendly stock,      but leastways you seem to be getting on right well. I      notice you're able to pay a hired hand."    </p>    <p>      "He don't get paid," Hiram retorted. "He's just working for      me till his back pay amounts to the worth of the place.      Then I'll go to work for him."    </p>    <p>      "Well, you got yourself a big mess of children. You must be      making <em>some</em> money, or you couldn't afford to feed      them all."    </p>    <p>      "Aw, that ain't hard," said Hiram. "I just find out what      food they don't like and give them plenty of it."    </p>    <p>      At that point, Hiram grabbed the jug again, took two full      swigs and commenced lecturing about another distinctive New      England trait: frugality.    </p>    <p>      Now look here, boys, it ain't like I'm the only one who      ever squeezed a dollar. I was down at Cola Hudson's general      store just last week to pick up a few tomatoes. When I      pointed out to Cola that her tomatoes were pretty small for      being so pricey, all she said was, "Yup." I took 'em home,      ate 'em down and dropped back by Cola's the next day.    </p>    <p>      "Those tomatoes didn't taste very good," I told her.    </p>    <p>      "Good thing they was small, wasn't it," was all she'd say.    </p>    <p>      Then there was that church supper I went to last month. The      dessert table was decked out with fresh-baked biscuits      covered with fresh strawberries and whipped cream-all      guarded by a big woman with a cash box and a sign that      said, "Strawberry Shortcake. First Plate, 50 cents. All You      Want, $1."    </p>    <p>      Well, I got me a serving, ate it up and prepared to leave.      I went to the lady and handed her 50 cents.    </p>    <p>      "Want any more?" she asked.    </p>    <p>      "Nope, I'm full."    </p>    <p>      "Then you owe $1," she said. Made me pay it, too.    </p>    <p>      Safford Bayley, the dairyman down the road, he ain't no big      spender. I remember when I saw him after he got married. "I      hear you got hitched, Safford," I said.    </p>    <p>      "That's right."    </p>    <p>      "Where did you go for your honeymoon?" "Niagara Falls."    </p>    <p>      "Enjoy it?"    </p>    <p>      "Sure did."    </p>    <p>      "Did your wife like it?"    </p>    <p>      "She didn't go."    </p>    <p>      "Didn't go?!"    </p>    <p>      "Heck, no. She'd <em>been</em> to Niagara Falls." That's      not all. Safford once went into the Montpelier Bank and      asked the loan officer there to lend him $5,000.    </p>    <p>      "What kind of security you got, Mr. Bayley?" the officer      asked.    </p>    <p>      "Just my farm."    </p>    <p>      "What's the land like?"    </p>    <p>      "Well, it's got 140 acres, but all but 20 are swamp or      woods."    </p>    <p>      "How's the barn?"    </p>    <p>      "Well, one side's sunk down pretty bad. And a good bit of      the roof blew off in a windstorm. But I can fix most of      that."    </p>    <p>      "Got any animals?"    </p>    <p>      "Twenty-five cows. They seem to get mastitis pretty often,      though, and a few of 'em's barren. Look, are you going to      give me the loan or not?"    </p>    <p>      "I'm afraid we can't give a loan to a man in your      circumstances."    </p>    <p>      Safford got right up from that desk, went over to the      teller and deposited $5,000 in a savings account. The loan      officer was so stunned he stopped Safford from leaving to      press him for an explanation.    </p>    <p>      Said Safford, "I just inherited $5,000 from my late uncle.      I wasn't sure where to put it, so I decided to check out      your bank. When you told me you wouldn't make a loan to a      man like me, I figured the money was real safe here."    </p>    <p>      Then there's Renwick Teed, runs the bait shop. Remember      that summer tourister professor I told you about before? He      once tried to trick Renwick out of a dollar. "Let's play a      game," he says, all sly-like. "We'll ask each other a      question, and the person who can't answer pays the other a      dollar."    </p>    <p>      "I don't know," Renwick replied. "You've had twice the      education I ever got. Seems like it'd be fairer if I only      had to pay 50C when I miss."    </p>    <p>      "Agreed," the professor laughed. "I'll even let you go      first."    </p>    <p>      "All right, what has three legs and flies?"    </p>    <p>      Well, the professor pondered that one quite a while, but      finally he gave up. "Here's your dollar," he said. "Now      it's my turn. What <em>does</em> have three legs and      flies?"    </p>    <p>      "Darned if I know," Renwick said. "Here's your 50 cents."    </p>    <p>      No sirree, I ain't alone when it comes to being tight with      money. Everybody in Vermont's that way. Why, I went to a      town meeting last fall, and Ashley Blodgett, the butcher,      spoke right up in public. "Mr. Chairman," he said, "is it      true the town recently paid the hospital $500 to pay for      the birth of Iva Lack's illegitimate child?"    </p>    <p>      "That's right."    </p>    <p>      "Is it also true," Blodgett continued, "that the town later      collected $550 from the father of said illegitimate child?"    </p>    <p>      "A-yup."    </p>    <p>      "Well then, you might say the town made a net profit of $50      on the deal?"    </p>    <p>      "I guess you could."    </p>    <p>      "Mr. Chairman, I make a motion we breed her again."    </p>
