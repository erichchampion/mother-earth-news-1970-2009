          		      <p>      <em>A top professional shares some of the secrets of his      artful trade.</em></p> 			<h5 id="byline"><em>By Alan D. Carey</em></h5>	     <p>      <em>This article is excerpted from the third issue of</em>      <em>MOTHER's</em> <em>new companion publication,</em>      <em>AMERICAN COUNTRY.</em> <em>(The entire third issue is      devoted to outdoor adventures and wilderness skills.) You      can pick up a copy at your local newsstand beginning June      1, or seepage 16 for details on subscribing to the varied      and informative</em> <em>AMERICAN COUNTRY</em>      <em>series.</em>    </p>    <p>      A common misconception among the uninitiated is that      professional wildlife photographers spend most of their      time stalking through the woods decked out in camouflage      like so many photo-Rambos, clicking away at whatever      species of animals or birds happen into their view finders.      I stalk occasionally, but it's usually futile-wild      animals have such keen senses that attempting to approach      them generally nets nothing better than blurred shots of      the south ends of northbound critters.    </p>    <p>      A far more productive technique-and one used      extensively by professionals-is to concentrate on      just one species at a time, learning all you can about both      the animal and its home turf, then putting yourself in the      right place at the right time and <em>letting your quarry      come to you.</em>    </p>    <h3>Hide and Peek</h3>    <p>      One of the most effective (and comfortable) ways to      photograph wildlife at close range is to hide yourself in a      blind. The trick to successful blind shooting is to set up      in a location where your quarry is almost certain to      appear-such as near a den, nest, water hole or      feeding area.    </p>    <p>      Although some excellent commercial blinds are available      (and an inexpensive camouflaged dome tent can be pressed      into service), I prefer to roll my own. With a lot of help      from my wife and her sewing machine, I've accumulated a      closetful of homespun blinds over the years, each one      unique and suited to a specific photographic need.    </p>    <p>      There are a number of important variables to consider in      deciding where to place your blind. Foremost among them is      the welfare of the animals you're working with. As a rule      of thumb, if your presence seems to be altering the normal      behavior of your subjects, you're too close. If, for      example, you erect a blind near a nest of hatchling birds      and the parents fail to return to care for their chicks,      then you should move the blind farther back; if that      doesn't ease the parents' worries, disassemble the blind      and abandon the area. To avoid problems like this when      photographing nesting birds or denning mammals, locate your      blind quite a distance away. Then, over a period of several      days, gradually move it closer, thus allowing your subjects      time to become accustomed to its presence.    </p>    <p>      You'll quickly learn that the willingness of wildlife to      tolerate the intrusion of a blind varies considerably from      one species to another, and even among individuals of the      same species. I'm reminded of the time several summers ago      when I was shooting on a wildlife refuge in north central      Montana. With the assistance of the refuge manager, I had      erected a blind on an island right at the edge of a colony      of nesting white pelicans. Even though the blind was out in      the open, the adult birds returned to their chicks as soon      as I ducked inside. The pelicans generally ignored      me-at times wandering as near as 10 feet-for      the seven hours I remained there photographing them.    </p>    <p>      Now contrast that experience with the time I erected the      same blind, again in the open, 80 feet from a deer carcass      on which a pair of bald eagles had been feeding. I waited      there for eight hours, but the circling eagles kept their      distance, refusing to come in. Of course, as soon as I took      the blind down and left, the big raptors returned to their      feast.    </p>    <p>     <strong> <em>If you're afraid of bad weather</em> <em>or can't drag      yourself from bed before dawn, your photo success will      suffer.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      When positioning a blind, keep in mind not only the angle      of the sun, but wind direction as well. For instance, if I      wanted to photograph a den of coyotes with direct front      lighting, I would set up a blind east of the den to      capitalize on the morning sun. And since the prevailing      morning winds in this part of the country blow from the      west, my scent would be carried away from the coyotes.      (You'll come to appreciate the predatory nose the first      time the breeze shifts and you watch a previously relaxed      bear, wolf, coyote, fox or cat lift its head, glance around      nervously, then beat a fleet retreat.)    </p>    <p>      Another important consideration when siting a blind is      assuring an unobstructed view. Few things are more      frustrating to a wildlife photographer than waiting long      hours in a blind for a particular animal to show itself,      then-just as it steps out in the open, bathed in soft      afternoon light-finding that your camera's view of      its head is blocked by a patch of tall grass you'd failed      to notice when you set up.    </p>    <h3>Blind Mobility</h3>		    <p>      An alternative to sitting for hours in a blind is to sit      for hours in a vehicle. An automobile serves as a blind      that-though generally restricted to      roadways-provides comfort, mobility, wraparound      visibility and the means to approach many species of wild      animals and birds without alarming them.    </p>    <p>      Pheasants, for example, are extremely nervous birds that      never hesitate to fly the proverbial coop at the first sign      of human approach. But they will frequently allow a vehicle      to pull right up alongside them. Consequently, I've      photographed nearly every pheasant in my files from the      comfort of my pickup. Some animals, such as mule deer,      occasionally will even allow you to climb out of your      vehicle to film them-as long as you don't move too      far in their direction or make any sudden movements.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, tripods aren't designed to be used in vehicles,      but I've found two alternative camera-support systems that      are. One is a commercial unit that clamps to the top edge      of a side window. This lightweight, compact device performs      surprisingly well, allowing me to pan smoothly on moving      subjects. I also use a large beanbag of my wife's      manufacture. With the window rolled all the way down, I      drape the bag over the sill, then nestle my camera and lens      into this portable pillow.    </p>  <h3> Lens Logic</h3>    <p>      Many novices are surprised to learn that professional      wildlife photographers don't generally run around the      boonies with footlong 800 mm lenses, filming their subjects      at incredible ranges. Fact is, the largest lens most pros      own is a 600 mm. My largest is a 400 mm (eight      power)-on which I occasionally use a 1.4      teleconverter to increase the focal length to 560 mm      (roughly 11 power). But my breadand-butter lens is the 400      mm.    </p>    <p>      One good reason that pros rarely use lenses over 600 mm is      the size of the monsters: Not only is a long lens      cumbersome to handle, but it magnifies even the slightest      movement, producing "soft," or blurred, photos. Of course,      you could compensate for movement with a fast shutter speed      . . . except that monster lenses also have excessive      appetites for light. And since the best wildlife photo      opportunities often present themselves in weak light,      you're obliged to compensate for a fast shutter speed by      using high-speed film-which produces grainy pictures.      As you can see, there's no easy way out of this big-lens      pickle . . . except to opt for a 400 mm or smaller lens and      depend on skill rather than technology to bag the shots      you're after.    </p>    <h3>Support Your Local Lens</h3>    <p>      The rule of thumb for hand-holding a camera is to attempt      it only when composition and light conditions permit using      a shutter speed that's approximately equal to the focal      length of the lens. In other words, you should chance      hand-holding a 400 mm lens only when you can use a shutter      speed of at least 1/400 second. Likewise, a 135 mm lens      would require a shutter speed of at least 1/125, and so on.    </p> <h3>  Film</h3>    <p>      I shoot nothing but slides. For one thing, slide film costs      less to use than print film-especially if you      purchase it in quantity from discount mail-order houses,      complete with prepaid, mail-in processing. Another      advantage of slides is that they can be projected onto a      screen, making for a much more dramatic and enjoyable      presentation of your photographic trophies than skimpy      little prints. And if you want prints, they can be made      from slides almost as easily as from color negs, giving you      the best of both worlds. But the single most important      reason I shoot slides is that few magazines-the      professional photographer's primary customers-will      accept anything else.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wildlife photography demands all of the skills of an expert      hunter, plus good camera technique.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I must confess that I've been somewhat narrow-minded in my      selection of film in the past, having shot almost      exclusively with Kodachrome 64 for several years now.      Kodachrome 25 is also an excellent film, but its extremely      slow speed renders it too inflexible for wildlife      photography. I prefer Kodachrome over other films for its      rich color and exceptionally fine grain. I have, on rare      occasion, shot Ektachrome 200-and have always been      disappointed. Ektachrome is grainy and produces a bluish      cast; its advantage is that it can be processed overnight      by most local photo labs, while Kodachrome must be sent to      a Kodak lab, requiring at least a week for processing and      return.    </p>    <p>      Another film that can be processed locally is Fujichrome,      available in ASAs of 50, 100, and 400. Fujichrome is a      fine-grained film with excellent color, especially the      yellows. A relative newcomer, Fuji holds its own with      Kodachrome in every way, and I'll undoubtedly use it more      in the future.    </p>    <h3>Wildlife Is Where You Find It</h3>    <p>      I'm often asked by prospective wildlife photographers where      they should go to find photogenic subjects. The most      popular place-in the lower 48, at least-is      Yellowstone National Park, but its extreme popularity is      precisely its problem. (That dramatic elk shot loses some      of its drama if there's another photographer in the      background.) The best place to start is in your own back      yard, or perhaps at a local park.    </p>    <p>      It's a lot cheaper and less frustrating to discover that a      new piece of equipment isn't working properly in your own      back yard than in a national park half a continent away.      Only after you've built confidence in your gear and      yourself should you consider tripping off to some faraway      wildlife sanctuary.    </p>    <p>      When you do go, national parks are always good      bets-if you can arrange your trip for a season when      the wildlife is out in force but the tourists aren't.      Better than national parks, in most cases, are wildlife      refuges. There are over 400 national refuges in the lower      48 and Alaska, many of them located within weekend striking      distance of major metropolitan areas. Waterfowl is the main      attraction on most of these refuges, but there's always a      host of other interesting critters in such places as well.      Depending on the refuge, you may see anything from elk and      black bear to bald eagles and whooping cranes. Less      dramatic but just as challenging to photograph are      songbirds and small mammals such as raccoons, muskrats,      porcupines and beavers.    </p>   <h3>A Potpourri of Professional Tips</h3>	 		<p>		Wildlife photography is a form of hunting; to get good    photos you must become a skilled predator. When circumstance    requires you to make an open approach to a wild animal or    bird, don't charge straight toward it or make direct eye    contact. Instead, employ a trick known to wolves and other    large predators for millennia: Amble casually toward the    subject in a zigzag fashion, appearing to look in another    direction while using your peripheral vision to keep track of    your quarry. This way, the animal may assume that you're just    passing by and present no threat. (This technique works    especially well in national parks and on refuges where    animals have become somewhat inured to the presence of    humans.) You're not likely to get good pictures if you can't    drag yourself out of bed before daylight in order to be where    you need to be, when you need to be there. The primary reason    for doing the early-bird act is that wild animals are most    visible during the earliest hours of morning, simply because    they're still on the move-feeding, hunting and drifting    from feeding to bedding areas. A second reason for getting    out early is light. The warm tones of low-angle light are    always superior to the harsh glare and deep shadows of    midday; photos of wildlife taken at the edges of day seem to    glow and almost leap out at the viewer.		</p>    <p>      Late afternoon is also a good bet-but I've found that      on warm days animals rarely start moving until right at      sunset when the air begins to cool, leaving you with little      light and minimal shooting time.    </p>    <p>      Don't forgo getting out just because the weather is lousy.      Some of the most dramatic pictures in my files were taken      on stormy days when I would much rather have been sitting      at home with a cup of something hot and a good magazine.      When the weather is bleak, wild animals seem to stay active      through more of the day. Also, on cloudy days the light is      softer, with less contrast. I love to shoot in the fog or      during snowstorms because of the variety of moods that can      be created. Stormy weather lends pictures more feeling and      expression. Sometimes, as when shooting wildlife that's      running or flying, it's all you can do just to keep your      quarry in the view finder and in focus. But when an animal      is stand ing patiently in one of those gorgeous settings      that all wildlife photographers dream about, you certainly      don't want to blow the opportunity because your exposure is      off: The answer is bracketing.    </p>    <p>      To bracket, simply shoot a frame at whatever f-stop your      light meter indicates, then rotate the aperture a half stop      at a time, shooting as you go, until you've bracketed a      full stop to either side of the meter setting, for a total      of five shots. This procedure gobbles film, but it also      assures at least one properly exposed photo from each      series.    </p>    <p>      A motor drive is a gadget that mounts to a 35 mm camera      body and automatically advances the film at a machine-gun      rate of five frames per second. This allows the      photographer to concentrate on fastmoving subjects and      focus without having to reach up and advance the film by      hand. Motor drives also greatly facilitate rapid      bracketing. As you might expect, though, they don't come      cheap. A less expensive alternative is the autowinder, a      device that performs the same chores as a motor drive, but      not quite as fast (usually around two frames per second).    </p>    <p>      (Caution: It's easy to become addicted to these rapid-fire      gadgets, but try to keep in mind that even the handiest of      accessories are just <em>that-accessories; in</em> no      way are they requisite for bagging award-winning photos.)    </p>    <h3>The Rewards</h3>		     <p>      Wildlife photography is, to borrow an expression from an      old song, a many-splendored thing. In addition to the      obvious lure of capturing fleeting images on film for the      enjoyment of yourself and others-and maybe even      picking up a few bucks and some public recognition of your      work in the process-there's the excitement and chal      lenge of getting close enough to various wild creatures to      make telling shots. Then there's the healthy enjoyment of      vigorous days spent afield-and, perhaps best of all,      the rare privilege of observing firsthand something of the      secretive lives of our fellow earthlings.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Alan D.
