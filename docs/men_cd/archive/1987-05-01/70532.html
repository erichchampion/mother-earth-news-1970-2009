                  <h3> For shaky chefs with a finny phobia.</h3>	<h5 id="byline"> By Carol Taylor </h5>  <h3> PHOTOGRAPHS © GRANT PETERSON</h3>    <p>      Last summer, when MOTHER'S editor in chief returned from      North Carolina's Outer Banks with a freezerful of yellowfin      tuna, he shared his catch with the editorial staff.      Everyone applauded his skill and praised his generosity.      Then, all afternoon, editors and illustrators skulked into      my office, muttering, "How do you cook this stuff?"    </p>    <p>      There's nothing like raw fish for intimidating perfectly      competent cooks. Assured with soufflés, blasé      with béarnaise, they shrink from a sea bass. And no      wonder: Fish is badly cooked so consistently that the means      of preparing it can seem as unfathomable as the waters it      came from.    </p>    <p>      Actually, fixing fish requires neither elaborate equipment      nor complicated technique. If you can bake, broil, fry and      simmer, you can produce superb seafood. When dinner goes      awry, it's usually because 1) the fish isn't fresh, 2) the      cooking method doesn't match the species or 3) the fish      overcooks. All these pitfalls are easy to avoid.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fresh or Foul?<br /></strong><br />      Fish is the most perishable of foods-delightful on      Monday, rank on Thursday. The "fishy flavor" that keeps so      many people loyal to pork chops is the taste of      <em>old</em> fish. And once fish has turned, no sauce can      disguise its taste.    </p>    <p>      If you reel in your own dinner, the rule is simple: Cook it      (or freeze it) the day you catch it-or the next day      at the latest. But if you're casting about for supper in a      supermarket, things get more complicated; you don't know      how long that fish has been out of water. How can you tell      if it's edible before you buy it?    </p>    <p>      There are several ways to judge whether fish is fresh (see      above). But the best way is to smell it. Fresh fish has      either no odor at all or a pleasant, briny scent. Fish with      a strong odor is too old to buy; it will taste the way it      smells, no matter how you cook it.    </p>   <h3> Fat or Lean?</h3>        <p>      <strong>a) FLESH</strong> should be firm and spring back      when poked.<br />      <strong>b) EYES</strong> should be bright and clear.<br />      <strong>c) SCALES</strong> should be an. chored to the      skin.    </p>    <p>      Basically, there are two kinds of fish and four ways to      cook them. The trick is to match the former with the      latter.    </p>    <p>      Whether freshwater or saltwater, fish are either lean or      fat. Most are lean. Whatever oil they have is concentrated      in the liver (hence cod-liver oil). With little fat in the      flesh, lean fish are white or light-colored and mild in      flavor. Examples: perch, pike, bass, cod, flounder, haddock      and red snapper.    </p>    <p>      In fat fish, oil is distributed throughout the flesh, which      is darker or pink, with a more pronounced flavor.      Whitefish, bluefish, mackerel, tuna and some salmon are      popular fat fish. (Don't be put off by that term. Even the      oiliest fish are only about 10% fat; ground beef weighs in      at 30%. And researchers are investigating the possibility      that fatty omega-3 acids deter heart disease.)    </p>    <p>      Once you know a fish's fat content, you can decide on an      appropriate cooking technique: baking, broiling, frying or      poaching (simmering in a liquid). With lean fish, the      critical problem is to keep it from drying out. Thus, it      lends itself to the wet-heat methods- poaching and      frying-which add moisture or fat. Lean fish also bakes      well, as long as it's covered with a sauce or basted with      an oilbased marinade. Broiling is chancy. The intense,      direct heat dries and toughens. If you must broil lean      fish, watch it like a fish hawk and slather it with fat.    </p>    <p>      Fat fish, on the other hand, thrives under dry heat; it      bakes and broils extremely well. It's less successful when      fried (super-greasy) or poached (except for salmon, the      classic poached fish). However it's cooked, fat fish can      taste oily unless it's prepared with an acid ingredient:      citrus, vinegar or wine.    </p>    <p>      The weather and the food distribution system being what      they are, it's hard to predict what will be caught and      delivered. So it's best to shop for a type of fish, rather      than for a particular species. While the fish in each      category are not identical, they are largely      interchangeable. If your recipe calls for orange      roughy-a lean New Zealand import-and there's      none to be had, substitute any lean variety that's fresh      and affordable.    </p>   <h3>Done or Devastated?</h3>    <p>      In preparing fish, the single most important factor is not      how you cook it but when you stop. Badly cooked usually      means over-cooked-a sweet, succulent fish made dry,      tasteless and tough. There are three ways to tell when it's      done:    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Canadian method.</strong> Lay the fish on the      counter and measure it at its thickest part. Then,      regardless of cut or cooking technique, cook it 10 minutes      per inch, even if it's stuffed or rolled. The only      exceptions: 15 minutes per inch if cooked in foil, 20      minutes if frozen.    </p>    <p>      Nothing so simple should work so well. Devised by the      Canadian Department of Fisheries, the system is almost      infallible. Occasionally, fish will overcook, so it's wise      to check it shortly before its time is up, using the two      methods listed below.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Opacity.</strong> When fish is done, it changes      from translucent to opaque. Insert a thin knife into the      thickest part of the fish, and look. The flesh should also      be moist and shiny. Opacity is the most accurate measure of      doneness.<br />      <strong>The flake test.</strong> Virtually every cookbook      ever written says to cook fish "until done, or until it      flakes easily with a fork." This is helpful if you have      ever seen a fish actually "flake," useless if you haven't.      Most people visualize the fish disintegrating into chips      the size of soap flakes-and, if cooked long enough, it will      oblige. Unfortunately, at that point it's inedible.    </p>    <p>      When fish is cooked, it doesn't so much flake as chunk, or      break apart. Insert a fork into the thickest part-it      should enter easily, with little resistance-and twist      gently; the fish should crack apart. Although the best      known of the three, the flake test is the least reliable.      By the time some varieties flake-especially solid,      meaty ones like salmon and tuna-they're overdone.    </p>    <p>      Once you've eaten well-cooked fish, you'll know it when you      see it, touch it and taste it. But if, like many people,      you've never eaten it any way but overcooked, your primary      problem will be convincing yourself that it really is done      when it meets the three tests. Until all this is second      nature, you might try these rules of thumb: If the fish      looks halfraw, stay alert; it's almost ready. If you can't      decide whether it's done, it is. If you're absolutely      certain it's fully cooked, call the cat. Everyone else will      be eating hamburger.    </p>    <h3>The Four Techniques</h3>    <p>      <strong>Baking.</strong> Baking is one of the simplest,      easiest and safest ways to cook fish. Preheat the oven to      450°F and wipe the fish with paper towels. Oil a baking      pan, or coat it with nonstick spray. Place the fish in the      pan, and brush with a mixture of equal parts lemon juice      and melted butter. Bake 10 minutes per inch, basting twice      and checking for doneness 1 or 2 minutes earlier.    </p>    <p>      <em>The important thing</em> <em>is not how you cook it but      when you stop.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Broiling.</strong> Preheat the broiler for 10      minutes. Oil a broiling pan (or coat it with nonstick      spray), place the fish on the rack, brush with butter or      oil (or butter and lemon juice) and broil 2 to 4 inches      from the heat for 10 minutes per inch, basting and checking      for doneness frequently. Only very thick pieces should be      turned during cooking.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Poaching.</strong> Texture largely determines      whether a fish poaches well. Soft-textured      fish-bluefish, for example-disintegrate in a      simmering liquid. Firm fish-perch, trout, salmon,      swordfish, snapper, in fact most fish-hold their      shape.    </p>    <p>      The traditional poaching liquid is a court bouillon ("coor      boo-yon"), a vegetable-and-wine broth that varies with the      cook. A typical list of ingredients: 6 1/2 cups water; 1      1/2 cups dry white wine; 1 large carrot, sliced; 1 rib      celery, sliced; 1/2 lemon, sliced; 2 sprigs parsley; 6      black peppercorns; 1 bay leaf. Simmer the ingredients for      10 to 15 minutes to combine the flavors.    </p>    <p>      To poach fish, prepare the court bouillon (or use a liquid      of your own devising) in a large pot. Wipe the fish with      paper towels, place it on a rack and lower it into boiling      liquid. Cover the pot. When the liquid returns to a boil,      immediately reduce the heat until the liquid quivers but      does not boil. (Small bubbles should rise gently from the      bottom.) Cook 10 minutes per inch, checking for doneness 1      or 2 mintues earlier.    </p>    <p>      Plain poached fish can be rather bland. Plan to serve it      with a sauce or condiment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Frying.</strong> Fish can be pan-fried (in a little      oil) or deep-fried (in a lot).    </p>    <p>      <em>Pan-frying:</em> Heat 1/8 to 1/4 inch vegetable oil in      a heavy skillet until oil is medium hot (a drop of water      should sizzle when dropped into the oil). Wipe the fish      with paper towels, dust with seasoned flour (a mix of      flour, salt and pepper) and fry 10 minutes per inch,      dividing the time between the two sides and checking for      doneness 1 or 2 minutes earlier. Don't crowd the fish while      they're cooking, or the oil will cool and the fish will be      soggy. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.    </p>    <p>      <em>Deep-frying:</em> Make a batter and chill it. (Any      flour-based batter will do. One example: Combine 1 cup      flour, 3 tablespoons cornstarch, l teaspoon salt, dash      nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Add 1 cup beer and 1      tablespoon oil and mix until smooth.)    </p>    <p>      Chill the fish, which should be in relatively small pieces.      Heat 2 to 3 inches oil in deep-fryer or deep skillet to      375°F (a 1-inch cube of bread should brown in 30      seconds). Don't fill the pan more than half full, or the      oil will overflow when hot. Pat the fish pieces dry with      paper towels, dip them in chilled batter and drop them into      the oil. Don't crowd them, or the oil will cool. Fry 10      minutes per inch, turning once and checking 1 or 2 minutes      before time is up. The outside should be crisp and brown,      the inside moist and opaque. The batter should form a crust      and seal the fat out.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Three Fine Kettles of Fish<br /></strong><br />      <strong>Baked, Stufed Red Snapper<br /></strong> 3/4 cup      chopped celery<br />      1/2 cup chopped onion<br />      1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine,      divided<br />      1 quart dry bread cubes<br />      1/2 cup sour cream<br />      1/4 cup diced, peeled lemon<br />      2 tablespoons grated lemon rind<br />      1 teaspoon paprika<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1 whole, dressed red snapper (or other lean fish), about 4      pounds    </p>    <p>      Cook celery and onion in 1/4 cup butter until tender.      Combine with bread cubes, sour cream, lemon, rind and      seasonings.    </p>    <p>      Clean, wash and dry fish. Stuff fish loosely. If desired,      close opening with small skewers or toothpicks. Place in      well-greased baking pan, brush with some of the remaining      butter and bake until done, basting occasionally with      butter. Remove skewers and serve. Serves 6.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fillets in Caper-Mustard Sauce<br /></strong> 4      teaspoons butter or margarine, divided<br />      1 teaspoon flour<br />      1/4 cup water<br />      2 tablespoons dry white wine<br />      1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard<br />      1 teaspoon drained capers<br />      1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind<br />      Freshly ground pepper<br />      2 lean fish fillets, 5 to 6 ounces each<br />      2 teaspoons lemon juice Salt to taste    </p>    <p>      Melt 2 teaspoons butter or margarine in small saucepan. Mix      in flour and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 1      minute. Remove from heat; stir in water, wine and mustard.      Return to heat and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer,      stirring constantly, until thickened. Add capers, lemon      rind and pepper to taste; remove from heat and keep warm.    </p>    <p>      Melt remaining butter and add lemon juice. Brush fillets      with lemon butter and broil or bake until done. Place      fillets on serving plate, add salt to taste and spoon sauce      over them. Serves 2.    </p>  <h3>  Rocky Mountain Trout</h3>    <p>      Enjoy this treat by a stream or re-create the river-outing      atmosphere in your home.    </p>    <p>      1/2 pound bacon slices<br />      2 white onions, thinly sliced, separated into rings<br />      1/3 cup yellow cornmeal<br />      1/3 cup all-purpose flour<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon pepper<br />      4 8-ounce trout, cleaned and scaled    </p>    <p>      In a large skillet, fry bacon until crisp. Remove from      skillet; drain on paper towels. Crumble into large pieces.      Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in skillet. Reserve      remaining drippings. Add onion rings to drippings in      skillet; saute until soft and transparent. Remove from      skillet; set aside. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons reserved      drippings to skillet; heat. In a shallow dish, combine      cornmeal, flour, salt and pepper. Rinse trout; shake dry.      Dip rinsed trout in cornmeal mixture, thoroughly coating      both sides. Panfry coated trout in hot bacon drippings 6 to      8 minutes, turning once, until coating is crisp and fish      tests done. Spoon sauteed onions and crumbled bacon around      fish. Serve immediately from skillet.    </p>    <p>      Once you become a fearless fish cook, you'll find that      seafood preparation is the easiest and fastest cooking you      can do. And you won't be unnerved when your boss comes to      work with yellowfin tuna. Just broil it, basting with a      mixture of lemon juice, Tabasco and melted butter. It's a      good recipe. I got it from our editor in chief.    </p>    <p>      <em>Carol Taylor is</em> <em>MOTHER's</em> <em>food      editor.</em>    </p>
