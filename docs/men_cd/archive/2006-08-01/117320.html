        <p>OK, so it’s expensive and remote. But it’s still one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Sitka is a coastal town in southeast Alaska with a mild maritime climate that will dispel any notions you may have about Alaska being completely frigid and snowy. In fact, the average winter low in Sitka is 30 degrees, much warmer than many continental towns on our list. And the average summer high is just 61 degrees, perfect for many outdoor activities such as hiking, kayaking and whale watching. The scenery is spectacular, with spruce forests, snow-capped mountains and island-dappled waters as far as you can see.</p><p>As long as you’re dreaming of the best places to live, you might as well dream big.</p><p><strong><em>Do you live in Sitka?
