        <p>To prevent weeds from overwhelming your garden (and improve plant and soil health in the process), follow these three easy principles:</p><ol><li><strong>Minimize soil disruption.</strong> Countless dormant weed seeds are buried within the soil, just waiting to be awakened by exposure to light or air. Preserve the soil's natural layers by not turning over the soil and keep those seeds asleep.<br /></li><li><strong>Mulch the soil surface.</strong> A layer of grass clippings, straw, chopped leaves or other organic mulch will smother small weed seedlings. In some situations living plants (cover crops) can prevent weeds while also improving soil fertility.<br /></li><li><strong>Use drip irrigation.</strong> Employing drip irrigation pinpoints where water is needed most and prevents wasteful watering, which can lead to weed growth in paths and other unplanted areas.</li></ol><p>For more helpful tips, read Lee Reich’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weedless-Gardening-Lee-Reich/dp/0761116966" target="_blank">Weedless Gardening</a>.</p>
