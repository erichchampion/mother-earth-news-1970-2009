        <h5>Issue #217  August/September 2006</h5><h5>By Stephanie Bloyd</h5><p>Cursed with a brown thumb? Gardening expert and <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> contributing editor Barbara Pleasant has come to your rescue with her latest book: <em>The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual: Essential Know-how for Keeping (Not Killing!) More Than 160 Indoor Plants</em> (Storey Publishing, 2005).</p><p>Complete with color photos, the book’s identification guide divides more than 160 plants into five easy-to-understand categories so beginners can quickly classify and learn about new plants. This 365 page book also features a list of common houseplants together with their botanical names and provides an extensive section on houseplant care to guide novices in planting, propagation, eliminating pests and more.</p><p>The book features many helpful tips, such as tilting a plant to judge by weight how much water is (or is not) in the soil, and reducing trauma to new plants by giving them a couple of weeks to adjust before repotting them.</p><p>In her research for the book, Pleasant was struck by the lack of consumer knowledge about many of the houseplants available at garden centers. “When I started working on the book, I took a notebook to a big garden center and made notes on what people bought from the indoor plant display,” she says. “I had to hold back from steering people away from plants with a very short shelf life, so in the book I was careful to cover the pros and cons of blooming houseplants. I also discovered the terrible way many indoor plants are labeled. Often, the only thing on the label is ‘6-inch foliage plant.’ That’s where the plant identification key in this book can be helpful, as well as the color photographs.”</p><p>Pleasant encourages readers to explore the world of houseplants, which she thinks holds something for everyone interested in gardening. “I think everyone should keep a few indoor plants, which have the mysterious ability to make us feel good,” she says. “There are indoor plants for every lifestyle, from sun-loving succulents for solar spaces to little terrarium plants for people who travel a lot.”</p><p>To order the book, visit <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/shopping/detail.aspx?itemnumber=2614" target="_blank">Mother Earth Shopping</a>.</p>
