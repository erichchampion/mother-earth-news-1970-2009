        There are many good reasons to add fish, such as salmon, trout andherring, to your diet. Recent nutrition research confirmed thebenefits of eating oily fish, which are loaded with omega-3 fattyacids. Omega-3s are proven to boost brainpower and reduce the riskof heart disease and stroke. Eating fish may also improve eyehealth, reduce the risk of colon cancer and have therapeuticeffects for people suffering from depression and arthritis.<br /><br />But we're also hearing warnings against eating fish, specificallydirecting pregnant women and young children to avoid fish high inmercury.
