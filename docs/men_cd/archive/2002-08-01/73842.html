    <p>
                <p>      <strong>Garden & Yard</strong>    </p>            <p>      Spinach is one of the most tender and delicious of all the      leafy green vegetables. Yet in many gardens this delightful      crop is absent. The reason? Many gardeners have been      frustrated because they plant spinach in the spring and get      only a small harvest of undersized, parched leaves before      the spindly central flower stalk appears, signaling the      plant is starting to bolt or run to seed.    </p>    <p>      What's the best remedy for the spring spinach blues? Plant      a fall crop! By planting spinach at the end of summer      you'll get your crop off to a running start and have it      mature to its luscious best during the cool, golden days of      fall. After several years of trialing spinach varieties and      gathering information from other spinach aficionados around      the country, I'm convinced spinach can have a jump in      popularity if we just keep it cool.    </p>    <h3>      UNDERSTANDING SPINACH    </h3>        <p>      To appreciate why spring-planted spinach misbehaves, one      must know its humble origins. Spinach is a cool-season      vegetable originally grown in the fall and winter in the      fertile agricultural valleys of the Middle East. In spring,      longer days and warmer temperatures trigger spinach to      finish its cycle and go to seed.    </p>    <p>      Spinach contains nutrients that help prevent cancer, heart      disease and age-related eye diseases.<br />    </p>    <p>      While many modern spinach growers blame early hot weather      as the villain causing spinach to bolt, in actuality it is      the increasingly long days of spring, which signal the      plant to reproduce. Most modern spinach varieties will      initiate flowering when the days reach 14 hours, as early      as mid-May in the northern half of the United States.    </p>    <p>      The influence of hot weather, while more subtle, also has      an adverse effect on the quality of spinach sown in the      spring. Even mildly hot days in the upper 70s can      dramatically speed up the flowering of a spinach plant      that's already been triggered to bolt by day length. Also,      the tenderness and juiciness of the leaves is greatly      diminished after just a couple of days of hot spring      weather.    </p>    <p>      Certainly some gardeners claim success stories of      spring-planted spinach, but any gardener will be challenged      by the one-two punch of longer daylight hours and early hot      weather. Timing a fall crop properly can help you easily      avoid the pitfalls of spring, resulting in a bumper harvest      of succulent, huge, easy-to-pick spinach leaves. Just look      at the size of those leaves in the picture on top!    </p>    <h3>      YOUR FALL TARGET DATE    </h3>    <p>      Seed catalogs and gardening guides often advise gardeners      to plant their fall spinach crops four to six weeks before      a hard frost. In my own experience in both coastal      Washington State and southern Wisconsin, this means      planting between September 1and 10. Unfortunately this      strategy produces plants that are only about the diameter      of a teacup with leaves the size of silver dollars, before      the days become too cool for continued growth. This teacup      size is perfect for overwintering spinach (see      "Overwintering Spinach,") , but it doesn't produce the      yield a fall crop should.    </p>        <p>      Taking a tip from commercial spinach farmers who plant      their fall crop a full eight to 10 weeks before the first      hard frosts, I tried planting a number of spinach varieties      between the first and the third weeks of August. This      method has worked so well I have been spreading the news to      my spinachgrowing friends in other parts of North America,      and all of us have been amazed at our shared success. We've      been comparing notes on what varieties work the best, and      here's what we've found:    </p>    <h3>      BOUNTIFUL FALL VARIETIES    </h3>    <p>      I've grown a wide range of spinach varieties, both      open-pollinated and hybrid, smooth leaf and savoy (wrinkled      or curly), in my fall gardens. The first thing I learned      was that varieties I knew well from spring planting      performed differently in fall, For example, in spring      'Olympia' grows faster than the classic bolt-resistant      standard 'Tyee,' but in hot August weather, 'Tyee'      out-yielded 'Olympia.' I've had similar success with the      semisavoyleaf variety 'Indian Summer,' which like 'Tyee'      quickly produced baby-leaf cuttings by the end of August      and nice fullgrown leaves by midSeptember.    </p>    <p>      Other varieties that did well from early August plantings      (August 1 through 10) were the smooth-leaf varieties      'Viroflay,' 'Space,' and 'Olympia.' While these are not as      fastgrowing as 'Tyee' in August, they seem to really come      into their own with the cooler weather of September,      sometimes producing leaves that are 5 to 6 inches in      diameter by late September. In several regions 'Olympia'      performed superbly from August plantings, producing the      largest yields of all the varieties tested. 'Viroflay' and      'Olympia' also proved to be especially tasty varieties when      harvested in late September and October.    </p>    <p>      'Winter Bloomsdale' didn't grow fast, but chugged along and      kept producing succulent savoy leaves into the cold days of      October. David Cavagnaro, a skilled vegetable gardener and      photographer, has also tried his hand at planting spinach      in August in his gardens in Decorah, Iowa. David is very      enthusiastic about the tremendous yields he gets in late      September from his early August plantings. He says it is by      far the best spinach he's ever grown. Some leaves are the      size of his outstretched hand. "Even the big leaves are      still succulent and juicy and are really fun to pick," he      says. Smooth-leaf 'Olympia' and 'Space' varieties were also      the best yielders in my own garden in Bellingham,      Washington. In late September both grew to sizes most      gardeners only dream about.    </p>    <p>      Out on the East Coast, C.R. Lawn of FEDCO Seeds in      Waterville, Maine, had a similar experience, with 'Olympia'      outperforming all others in his fall garden. C.R. praises      the whole idea of fall spinach. "There's nothing like the      spinach you harvest on those crisp fall days. By the time      it's ready, the weather is cool and there's plenty of      moisture that's what spinach really likes."    </p>    <p>      Steve Bellavia, trials manager at ohnny's Selected Seeds in      Albion, Maine, also grew fall spinach a couple of years      ago, planted in August. While many of the varieties he      planted were impressive for their tenderness and yield,      Steve was most struck by the performance of 'Spinner.'      "[It] grew to a nice full size, was dark green and      flavorful, and was the best variety in the whole trial," he      says.    </p>    <p>      Many people believe savoy spinach varieties taste better      than smooth-leaf types, but that doesn't seem to be true      with fall crops. In our trials, the smooth-leaf varieties      'Olympia' and 'Viroflay' both got rave reviews for flavor,      while the standard savoy variety, 'Bloomsdale Long      Standing,' and its modern semisavoy cousin, Tyee,' both      proved less flavorful.    </p>    <h3>      KEEP YOUR SEEDS COOL    </h3>    <p>      Bellavia also reminded me of one of the pitfalls of      planting fall spinach. When he planted a fall-spinach plot      in early August, the soil was somewhat dry and then      received 1/3 inch of rain; daytime temperatures hovered in      the low 80s for a couple of weeks. Although the soil never      became excessively dry, the spinach came up rather      sparsely. Of course this can happen with any crop when You      allow the seedbed to dry out after planting, but this is      especially problematic for spinach when the weather is hot.      Spinach seed doesn't germinate well a bove 75 degrees and      won't come up at all when soil temperatures are above 85      degrees. One way to get a good stand of spinach when      planting in late summer is to water it lightly on hot days.      This will cool the sod enough to get a good stand      established.<br />    </p>    <p>      If you use this trick, try to plant into raised beds in the      best-drained spot in your garden to reduce the risk of root      rot. A well-drained soil also will stay warm longer,      enabling the spinach to grow a little more before the      season comes to an end. A soil with lots of mature compost      worked into it is very desirable, as spinach is a very      heavy feeder. We also found not all spinach varieties      planted in early August fared as well as some of our big      winners like 'Olympia' and 'Spinner.' David and I have had      the early August plantings of savoy varieties 'Long      Standing Bloomsdale' and 'Coho' bolt by early September      Why? Presumably because in our locations the day length was      still long enough in mid-August to trigger flowering. By      trying a number of different planting dates throughout      August we've found planting between August 15 and 20 seems      to be the best time of all for Northern gardeners. You'll      avoid the hottest days of early August, which can be tough      on spinach germination, and you'll avoid possible bolting      problems if you're in the higher latitudes of the North.      Certainly we've found that all the best fall varieties did      well planted in mid-August.    </p>    <h3>      IN THE SOUTH    </h3>    <p>      In parts of the southern United States growing fall spinach      has a long legacy. A large amount of fresh market spinach      was once grown for fall consumption in coastal Virginia and      Maryland near the Chesapeake Bay. These crops were      traditionally planted for the fall crop from mid-August      until mid-September. Long, warm autumns in this and other      mid-Atlantic areas will ensure bountiful crops that may      yield until the New Year. In Arkansas and Oklahoma spinach      can be planted in the second half of September for fall      salads that easily can take you into December In southern      Texas and in much of the Deep South, spinach can be planted      anytime from early October until the middle of November for      a fall crop that grows through the winter.    </p>    <p>      In the desert Southwest, where there's a wide range of      environments based on elevation, it's possible to plant      from late August until late November, but you'll have to      experiment for your location. When you plant spinach in      these hotter regions, it's much like planting it in August      in the North: Keep the seedbed cool with some irrigation      water (or some shade) until the seedlings emerge. Formerly      a spinach breeder at Alf Christianson Seed Company in Mt.      Vernon, Washington, John Navazio now breeds spinach and      other crops specifically for organic growers in the Upper      Midwest.    </p>    <h3>      Wilted Spinach Salad    </h3>        <p>      Succulent, fall-grown spinach is great for this recipe.      Just tear the bigger leaves into bite-size pieces after      washing.</p>    <p>      <em>Wash, trim and dry 6 cups of spinach and place into a      large salad bowl. Saute 4 or 5 slices of bacon until crisp,      remove from pan and cut into bits. Drain</em>off all but 2      tablespoons fat and add I tablespoon olive oil. (For a      vegan or vegetarian alternative skip the bacon altogether      and start with 3 tablespoons of olive oil,)    </p>    <p>      Saute cup grated onion in fat or oil for just a minute      before adding 1/2 teaspoon salt, teaspoon sugar, 1      tablespoon balsamic vinegar and 3 tablespoons white      vinegar. When sugar and salt are dissolved, slowly pour the      hot liquid over the spinach and liberally grind black      pepper over the salad. Toss. Garnish with chopped bacon and      serve on warm plates.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Overwintering Spinach</strong>    </p>    <p>      Spinach is one of the hardiest winter vegetables, sometimes      surviving temperatures far below freezing if grown to just      the right size before going through the coldest part of      winter. 'Winter Bloomsdale' and 'Winter Giant' are the      standards for overwintering, and 'Tyee' and 'Melody' have      been successfully overwintered in upstate New York and New      England. Savoy varieties generally overwinter better than      smooth-leaf types.</p>    <p>      The rule of thumb for getting the right-size spinach for      overwintering is to plant it four to six weeks before your      average first hard frost date. This should produce a      spinach plant about 3% to 4 inches in diameter, the best      size for overwintering. As far as mulching the plants for      protection, all I can say is that in my own experience in      wet Maine and Washington winters I've killed the plants, as      they had rotted under my leaf mulch by the time I uncovered      them in early spring. Perhaps porous row covers would work      better.    </p>		<h3>Spinach Seed Sources		</h3>    <p>      <strong>Johnny's Selected Seeds</strong> 184 Foss Hill Road      Albion, ME 04910 (207) 437-4301 <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com" target="_blank">www.johnnyseeds.com</a> 'Indian      Summer,' 'Space,' 'Spinner,' 'Tyee'    </p>    <p>      <strong>Seeds of Change</strong> (all organic seed) P.O.
