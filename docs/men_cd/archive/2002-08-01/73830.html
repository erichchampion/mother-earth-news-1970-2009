                <p>     <strong>Country lore</strong>    </p>            <p>      To save money on canning jars and lids, you can reuse      supermarket juice jars to can tomato or other juices. These      juice jar lids have a silicone liner that will reseal many      times. just be sure to check the juice before you use it to      be certain the recycled lid has stayed sealed. The center      of the lid should be slightly depressed and make a high,      tight sound when tapped.    </p>    <p>      Use lids that have metal tabs for screwing on. Some jars      have threads in the silicone layer lining the lid: These      quickly wear out and should <em>not</em> be reused.    </p>    <p>      This technique is probably not U.S. Department of      Agriculture approved, but I have been using these jars for      years, replacing worn lids as needed, with no problem      whatsoever.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Still Splitting Wood at 69</strong>    </p>    <p>      I have enjoyed <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> for years and years. At      age 69 I do not get into very large projects anymore, but I      still split my own firewood. I bought the mechanical wood      splitter advertised in your magazine (November 2001) and      find it easy to operate and a great, cheap way to split      wood rounds. I could not afford a gas wood splitter, nor do      I have the strength to split wood using a maul. But this      one allows me to split even knotty rounds.    </p>    <p>      The splitter is the Mean Green Splitting Machine, available      from <em>www.avalanchesnow.com</em> (877) 251-9900. It      costs $100 plus shipping. If you buy the oak base, it comes      with a spring and nylon washer that make it work better.      The base, however, is hard to put together just right.    </p>    <p>      JOANNA UHLER<br />      Elk, Washington    </p>    <p>      <strong>Recycling Rejects</strong>    </p>    <p>      My recycling tip is to check out your local hazardous waste      facility.<br />      Sounds awful, doesn't it? But our facility, actually      located in the next county, has an exchange room that      everyone is welcome to browse (no exchange needed). People      are encouraged to send unwanted paint and other chemicals      to the facility rather than improperly disposing them by      pouring them down the drain or behind the garage. And our      facility managers wisely put anything in good condition      into the exchange room.    </p>    <p>      I recently went there and picked up a gallon of paint for      our shed, metal primer and rust-proof paint, a can of      chalkboard paint, latex additive for grouting and a new,      never-been-used can of water sealer. The number of paint      cans was unbelievable, and there were many different      chemical compounds from oven cleaner to fertilizers, all      free for the taking.    </p>    <p>      How much better to use up rather than throw away what      others don't want. It's a great money saver, too.    </p>    <p>      MAUREEN UNGER<br />      Shawano, Wisconsin    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sweet Red Winter Peppers</strong>    </p>    <p>      We always have an abundance of just slightly blemished      sweet red peppers, one of our family's favorite vegetables      to cook with, winter or summer. We core and chop the      peppers, spread the pieces in a single layer on a cookie      sheet and then freeze them. When frozen, we seal them in a      plastic resealable bag and enjoy peppers all winter long.    </p>    <p>      Fresh basil is another dung we preserve for our soups and      casseroles in the winter When it is abundant, we puree it      with enough oil to make a duck paste, then freeze it in ice      cube trays. One cube will season a sauce, more will make a      lovely pesto.    </p>    <p>      ANINELLE DURHAM<br />      Upper Lake, California    </p>    <p>      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tackling Car Tar and Mosquito Bites</strong>    </p>    <p>      What do you do when you drive over a newly paved road and      get that black goo on your car? Make a paste of baking soda      and water, rub it on the spot and it will remove the tar.      This mixture also removes tree sap and mildew.    </p>    <p>      When bitten by a mosquito, immediately put Secret brand      deodorant on the bite to stop itching. It works.    </p>    <p>      PAULETTE BRUNNET<br />      North Fort Myers, Florida<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Homestead Hound</strong>    </p>        <p>      In my opinion, you can't beat the beagle as a top choice      for your homestead. Beagles will guard your yard and garden      from those shrub-eating, lettuce-mooching, "wascally      wabbits" and other critters. They have a loud and      distinctive voice, making them a good choice to warn of      visitors, whether friend or foe. They are clean dogs. Even      though they shed, their coats are short and relatively low      maintenance. Beagles are tolerant of other pets and enjoy      the company of humans most of all. They are quite social      animals.    </p>    <p>      Beagles are born hunters and will help you put delicious      rabbit on the table. In England, they gained prominence      during the days of Henry VIII. His daughter, Elizabeth I,      often took beagles to the hunting field in baskets attached      to the horses' saddles. Bred and developed mostly for      rabbit hunting, these energetic little fireballs have      proven themselves on practically every species of upland      game, even pheasants.    </p>    <p>      Beagles require little care other than a good diet, plenty      of fresh water, a yearly visit to the vet, occasional      brushing and the companionship of their families. They      crave affection and will respond with devotion.    </p>    <p>      GARY VOSHELL<br />      Wadena, Iowa    </p>    <p>      <strong>Make a Country Living</strong>    </p>    <p>      Being self-employed in the country can make a lot of sense,      since traditional jobs may be few and far between. If you      are suited for this particular way of working, the joy of      being able to craft your own place in the world doing      something you love, is beyond words.    </p>    <p>      In 1995, my husband accepted a job in a remote area of      Minnesota. We live eight miles from the closest town,      population 680. I've become a freelance writer, and here      are my tips for others who want to become self-employed:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Do something you excel at and have a passion      for.</strong> You will need your passion and enthusiasm to      maintain your momentum. Self-employment can be a lonely      venture (for those in the country, possibly lonelier).      You're it: There's no one to turn to when something goes      wrong. On the other hand, your successes are your own.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Constantly assess yourself and your business with      an honest eye.</strong> Don't overextend yourself and try      to offer every service possible if you're not prepared.      Word spreads fast in the country, which can work for you      (marketing, word of mouth) or against you (dissatisfied      customers, perceived bad service).    </p>    <p>      <strong>If you've moved from the city, learn to rethink      your approach to certain aspects of running a      business.</strong> Use mail order for supplies rather than      running to the store. Be prepared to deal with slow phone      lines or power outages if you depend on the Internet or      fax. Long-distance charges for phone calls can add up      quickly. Watch your expenses: Gasoline costs and mileage      are higher in the country.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lose the nine-to-five mentality</strong> , if you      ever had it. You're living closer to the land now. There      will be times when you will need to put homestead      activities (haying, gardening, food gathering, hunting,      animal care, maintenance) first. The land and the seasons      do not wait. Work your business around these ties to the      land, which make living in the country so great.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Think globally, if this applies to your      business.</strong> Make good use of the Internet, which      levels the playing field for businesses, even in remote      areas. If you can, offer your product or service beyond      immediate regional boundaries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pay off debts and become as self-sufficient as      possible.</strong> This will mean different things to      different households. income from self-employment can be      sporadic. Be prepared and have the necessary savings in the      bank. Avoid new debt. Consider other forms of      preparedness-food, storage, alternate power-if      this applies in your household. You want to be as      independent and flexible as possible.    </p>    <p>      While I admit I was ill-prepared for the transition from      city to country, I've settled in after several years and      love the country life and our homestead. Self-employment      and living in the country are a perfect fit, Both      incorporate self-reliance. Both can be hard teachers. But      for those who want it, there's not a better combination.    </p>    <p>      CATHERINE DYBIEC HOLM<br />      Cook, Minnesota    </p>
