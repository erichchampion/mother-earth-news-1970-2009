                <p>      <strong>Green</strong> Gazette    </p>        <p>      In our age of urban, suburban and even rural sprawl, no      land is sacred. But there are steps you can take to improve      the odds your beloved property won't someday be leveled for      yet another condominium development or amusement park.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Land covenants</strong> are land-use restrictions      between buyers and sellers, or between partners. They're      attached to the property deed and are recorded at the local      county courthouse. However, protection of covenants is up      to the new owner, and the covenants can be easily      overturned    </p>    <p>      <strong>A conservation easement</strong> is a type of      self-zoning, where you guarantee some land-use activities      and prohibit others by relinquishing certain landowner      rights to a monitoring and enforcing agency (such as a      local land trust organized tion or the U.S. Forest      Service). There are easements guaranteeing property will      never be logged, will always be reserved for agriculture or      will remain undeveloped.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Conservation trusts</strong> are another level of      protection, where you either donate or will your property      to an existing trust, or set up your own. Trusts are      nonprofit corporations with a charter that defines the uses      of the land it owns or controls. Starting and maintaining      your own trust can be challenging, even for a cooperating      neighborhood group.    </p>    <p>      Jesse Wolf Hardin    </p>    <p>      Hear more from Jesse in "Bringing Nature Home, " Page 128.    </p>
