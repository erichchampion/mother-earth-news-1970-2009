                <p>      <strong>Green</strong> Gazette    </p>        <p>      Just prior to the initial release of Fast Food Nation: The      Dark Side of the AllAmerican Meal, a representative of the      book's publisher, Houghton Mifflin, told Publisher's Weekly      the company had ordered a large first printing of the book      (while declining to say exactly how big). Houghton Mifflin      seemed a little overly optimistic given Nation was Eric      Schlosser's first book attempt and the book was about an      industry whose success was based in blandness.    </p>    <p>      I hen that first printing sold out. And then the second      printing did, too. And then the third ...    </p>    <p>      A year and a half and roughly 300,000 copies later, Nation      has been unanimously declared the biggest surprise      nonfiction bestseller of the century.    </p>    <p>      In the afterword to the paperback edition, Schlosser chalks      up Nation's popularity to timing. "Its success should not      be attributed to my literary style, my storytelling ability      or to the novelty of my arguments ... Not just in the      United States but throughout Western Europe, people are      beginning to question the massive, homogenizing systems      that produce, distribute and market their food."    </p>    <p>      All humility aside, Schlosser's thorough reporting and      compelling narrative obviously made some difference. (After      all, he's not the first person to assert that consolidation      is bad for small farmers or that meatpacking plants abuse      their largely immigrant workforce.)    </p>    <p>      But what's really fueled the book's success has been its      careful examination of the process involved in making fast      food so unremarkable. No element of modern American culture      goes untouched. MOTHER EARTH NEws readers won't be      surprised (much) by Schlosser's description of how      agricultural land, food and meat quality are harmed by      industrial production. But even knowledgeable readers might      be surprised to learn how even the smallest children are      targeted in the plans to make fast food chains      indispensable to Americans.    </p>    <p>      - Sarah Beth Cavanah    </p>    <p>      To order Fast Food Nation, see MTHER"S Bookshelf, Page 104.    </p>    <p>      Fast Food Facts: One in eight American workers has worked      for McDonald's.
