                <p>      CountryLore    </p>            <p>      In my opinion, you can't beat the beagle as a top choice      for your homestead. Beagles will guard your yard and garden      from those shrubeating, lettuce-mooching, "wascally      wabbits" and other critters. They have a loud and      distinctive voice, making them a good choice to warn of      visitors, whether friend or foe. They are clean dogs. Even      though they shed, their coats are short and relatively low      maintenance. Beagles are tolerant of other pets and enjoy      the company of humans most of all. They are quite social      animals.    </p>    <p>      Beagles are born hunters and will help you put delicious      rabbit on the table. In England, they gained prominence      during the days of Henry VIII. His daughter, Elizabeth I,      often took beagles to the hunting field in baskets attached      to the horses' saddles. Bred and developed mostly for      rabbit hunting, these energetic little fireballs have      proven themselves on practically every species of upland      game, even pheasants.    </p>    <p>      Beagles require little care other than a good diet, plenty      of fresh water, a yearly visit to the vet, occasional      brushing and the companionship of their families. They      crave affection and will respond with devotion.    </p>    <p>      GARY VOSHELL<br />      Wadena, Iowa    </p>
