                <p>      CountryLore    </p>        <p>      I have enjoyed <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> for years and years. At      age 69 I do not get into very large projects anymore, but I      still split my own firewood. I bought the mechanical wood      splitter advertised in your magazine (November 2001) and      find it easy to operate and a great, cheap way to split      wood rounds. I could not afford a gas wood splitter, nor do      I have the strength to split wood using a maul. But this      one allows me to split even knotty rounds.    </p>    <p>      The splitter is the Mean Green Splitting Machine, available      from <em>www.avalanchesnow.com</em> (877) 251-9900. It      costs $100 plus shipping. If you buy the oak base, it comes      with a spring and nylon washer that make it work better.      The base, however, is hard to put together just right.    </p>    <p>      JOANNA UHLER<br />      Elk, Washington<br />    </p>
