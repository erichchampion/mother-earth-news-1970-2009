                <p>      <strong>Energy & Environment</strong>    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By Dan Chiras		</h5>        <p>      If you're planning to build your dream home someday, this      article could save you thousands of dollars. Including      simple, passive-solar features in any style home can cost      next to nothing up front and save you unbelievable amounts      over the long-term in reduced energy bills.    </p>        <p>      Millions of homes easily could be designed to capture free      heat directly from the sun. But instead we are      burning-wasting-huge amounts of oil and natural      gas every winter. The missed opportunities to tap into      solar energy are so fantastic they boggle the mind, and      nowhere is our blindness to the potential of solar more      troublesome than in the home-heating arena.    </p>    <p>      You can incorporate passive-solar heating in any style      home, as the photos that accompany this story show. Or you      can add solar features when remodeling an existing home, as      long as the south side of the house receives full sun most      of the day. When correctly designed, solar homes provide      unrivaled comfort in winter and summer They offer large,      south-facing windows, generous views, sunny interiors and      open floor plans.    </p>    <p>      Architect Debbie Rucker Coleman, who has been designing      solar homes since 1985, says her clients are impressed with      how spacious the sunlight makes the home feel. "In addition      to low heating bills, passive-solar homes are cool in      summer. They are delightful places to live," she says.    </p>    <p>      Coleman's drawings show how two conventional house styles      could easily become passive-solar homes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Heating homes with sunlight, known as passive-solar      heating, is based on the simple idea of using south-facing      windows to admit low-angled winter sun. Sunlight streaming      into the home warms the interior space. Thermal mass, such      as tile floors and interior masonry walls, stores the sun's      heat and releases it when room temperatures fall at night      or during cloudy weather. Choose a house design that      accommodates the right amounts of south-facing glass and      thermal mass. Add careful caulking and ample insulation      (usually slightly higher than building codes currently      require), and you'll have a solar heated home that requires      little or no heat from any nonrenewable fuel source. In the      summer, a solar home's thermal mass and insulation,      together with properly sized overhangs to shade the      windows, keep the home comfortable and reduce cooling      requirements.    </p>    <p>      Simply orienting a conventional house to the south will cut      annual energy bills by at least 10 percent, saving      thousands of dollars over a home's lifetime. Add a long      south-facing wall of windows and some thermal mass and you      easily can tap sunshine's free energy to meet 50 percent to      70 percent of a home's heating requirements. Do your      homework or hire a solar architect to create a rigorous      passive-solar design and you can reduce your energy bills      by 80 percent to 100 percent. Given the probability energy      costs will increase steadily in the coming years, the      long-term savings from a passive solar home could become      very substantial, as we'll show in detail below.    </p>        <p>      <strong>UP-FRONT COSTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      According to Ron Judkoff, director of the Buildings and      Thermal Systems Center at the National Renewable Energy Lab      in Golden, Colorado, passive-solar features increase the      cost of building a new home by anywhere from nothing to      about 3 percent. (On a $200,000 home, for example, the      maximum additional cost of incorporating passive solar      heating might be only another $6,000.) Since many building      codes now require much more energy-efficient windows,      walls, ceilings and foundations than in the past, and      you'll need a much smaller furnace or other backup heat      source, passive solar frequently adds very little or      nothing to the cost of a new home.    </p>    <p>      Judkoff bases his cost estimates in part on a series of      case studies sponsored by NREL and the American Solar      Energy Society, headquartered in Boulder, Colorado. (See      "Comparing Passive Solar Savings".) Data on passive-solar      homes were collected from a variety of locations across the      United States. The study found the addition at cost of      building a passive-solar home ranged from nothing to 3      percent, while the annual savings from passive-solar      heating in the homes ranged from $220 in New Mexico to      $2,255 in New Hampshire. Based on recent energy prices, a      passive-solar home in a northern location could save you as      much as $67,000 on heating and cooling costs over a 30-year      period.    </p>    <p>      We all know energy prices are only going to rise. Some      regions already have experienced sudden 100-percent spikes      in natural gas prices. Major increases in natural gas and      oil prices seem inevitable. (See "Running Out of Gas.")      Without an inexpensive, reliable fuel source, millions of      homeowners who rely on natural gas and oil may suffer      enormous economic hardship. So let's take another look at      those estimated cost savings from the NREL and ASES case      studies. If we assume a 5 percent annual increase in energy      costs, the potential 30-year savings from a passive solar      home jump to $141,400, quite a return on a maximum      investment of just 3 percent of your construction costs. If      energy prices increase 10 percent per year, the estimated      30-year savings in cold climates could be more <em>than      $400,000.</em>    </p>    <p>      No one knows for sure how fast fuel prices will increase.      But whatever happens, passive solar clearly makes fantastic      sense from a financial standpoint. And the bonus is the      environmental benefit of reduced air pollution. Coleman      estimates that compared to the average home, her      2,100-square-foot solar home-with its average heating      or cooling costs of $12 per month will save 574,410 pounds      of carbon dioxide emissions over 30 years.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Solar Homes Tour</strong>    </p>    <p>      More than 800 solar homes will be showcased on October 5,      2002, as the American Solar Energy Society hosts the 2002      National Tour of Solar Homes.    </p>    <p>      On the ASES tour, homeowners and businesspeople will      explain how their photovoltaic and passive-solar systems      work, and how solar energy can maximize your home's energy      efficiency and cut your water heating bills.

Choose a site that receives south sun during winter.      Obstructions to the south of the site, such as tall      evergreen trees, buildings or hillsides, need to be kept at      least 1.7 times their height away from the home. When in      doubt, visit the site around December 21, when the sun is      the lowest in the sky. The site should receive full sun      from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.    </p>    <p>      If you're choosing to build on a small lot, select one that      is deep from north to south, to ensure good solar access.      Locating the house's septic drainage field within the solar      access zone is another strategy for maintaining good solar      access, since that area will need to be kept clear of trees      and shrubs, which would otherwise block the southern sun.    </p>    			    <p>      2. Choose a home design with few projections below the roof      line and no porches on the south. Projections shade      adjacent windows; porches on the south prevent the sun from      entering. Porches on the east and west can be beneficial by      shading windows from the hot summer sun.    </p>        <p>      3. Orient the longest wall of the house so it faces true      south. Rectangular floor plans minimize the exposure of      east and west walls to summer sun, which is especially      helpful in hot climates. The front, back, or side of the      house can be the south wall. (True south is not the same as      the magnetic south shown by compasses. Check with a local      surveyor's office to find out how many degrees to adjust      from magnetic south.)    </p>    <p>      Can you deviate from a due south orientation? Sure, but      you'll pay a price in dollars and thermal comfort. Straying      from a solarsouth design reduces wintertime heat gain and      may increase summertime solar gain, leading to overheating.    </p>    <p>      The more rooms that have some south windows, the better.      This helps eliminate the need for fans or ducts to move      warm air from one area to another. Place rooms that require      less heat, such as workshops, bedrooms and kitchens, on the      north side of the house.    </p>    			    <p>      4. Maximize windows on the south side. South glass should      be a minimum of 7 percent of the house's square footage for      a sun-tempered home and a maximum of 12 percent for fully      passive-solar designs. Don't go wild on windows. North,      east and west windows should follow the "Window Allocation      Guidelines". Exceeding the 12 percent guideline for south      windows may cause the home to overheat in summer, and may      allow excess heat loss from the windows during the night      and during long, cold, cloudy periods.    </p>    <p>      Coleman recommends choosing south glass carefully for your      climate. Many of the new low-emissivity (low-e) coatings      reduce heat loss and gain, but for south windows you do not      want glass that keeps out the solar heat. She recommends      south glass that has a Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)      of at least 0.5. In warmer climates with properly designed      south overhangs, uncoated double-parre glass is preferred.    </p>    			    <p>      5. Design the roof overhangs to shade windows properly from      the high summer sun. Overhangs are key to successful solar      homes. Judkoff says the exact geometry of overhangs is      critical for balancing the need to admit maximum sunlight      in winter and minimize solar heat gain in summer.      Generally, the warmer and sunnier the climate, the deeper      the overhang should be. A 2-foot overhang nicely shades an      8- to 9-foot wall in most locations. Coleman recommends the      Wet) site <em>www.susdesign.com/overhang/index.html</em> to      help you design overhangs properly. If overhangs aren't      possible, use insulated shutters to keep out the summer      sun.    </p>    <p>      6. Provide thermal mass (tile floors and brick or masonry      walls) in the south side of the house. Mass absorbs and      stores heat when sunlight strikes it or when its      temperature is lower than the air temperature. As the      room's air temperature drops below the mass' surface      temperature, heat is released and the air is warmed.      Temperatures indoors remain relatively stable and      comfortable, despite dramatic oscillations in outdoor      temperatures.    </p>    <p>      The mass in floors, framing, wallboard and furniture is      usually sufficient to accommodate the solar heat in      sun-tempered homes. But when you build a full passive solar      design with 'up to 12 percent south glass, you need to add      extra thermal mass in the form of tile, concrete floors, or      masonry walls or planters. For optimal results, some mass      should be in direct contact with the incoming sunlight      throughout the day. The mass also should be distributed      throughout the house. Add about 7 square feet of      4-inch-thick mass for every 1 square foot of south glass      above the 7 percent minimum. One easy, inexpensive way to      add this mass is to choose a concrete slab-on-grade      foundation.    </p>    <p>      In addition to these solar design factors, follow these two      principles that apply to all energy efficient homes:    </p>    			    <p>      7. Insulate and seal the structure well. Careful attention      to detail is essential. Insulation should not be compressed      and air should not leak in. If you can't get as much south      glass as you would like, adding extra insulation can result      in the same overall lower energy consumption. judkoff      recommends insulating at least to the level prescribed by      the International Energy Conservation Code or ASHRAE 90.2,      which are region-specific recommendations for the      building-envelope elements and mechanical systems. Choose      energy-efficient windows and consider using insulated      shades to keep heat from escaping at night (and to keep the      heat out in the summer), especially in cold climates.      Entryways separated from the main living space by an, inner      door are especially helpful in preventing cold air from      rushing in whenever the outside door is opened.    </p>		    <p>      8. Correctly size the heating and cooling system. Many      solar homes require almost no additional heat, so you will      need a much smaller, less expensive heating system. A      woodstove or natural gas wall heater may be sufficient, or      you can connect baseboard radiators to your hot water      heater. The insulation and thermal mass features of a solar      home make it more resistant to summer overheating, and in      some climates you may get by with using ceiling fans      instead of air-conditioning.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HELPFUL DESIGN TOOLS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many professional solar designers use powerful new software      like Energy-10, a computer program that allows designers to      predict the energy performance of various building-design      strategies, permitting a fine tuning of designs to achieve      optimal comfort, performance and economy. (Energy10 is      available from the Sustainable Buildings Industry Council.      See "Resources." ) Designers also use a Solar Pathfinder      <em>www.solarpathfinder.com ),</em> a $255 device that      allows a budder or architect to fully assess the year-round      solar potential of a site in about 15 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Debbie Rucker Coleman prefers a simpler approach using      <em>Passive Solar Design Strategies: Guidelines for Home      Building</em> by the Sustainable Buildings Industry Council      (see "Resources") . "Most homeowners would be able to      follow these guidelines, as the notebook is put together      very well. I like the program because it tells you the      percentage Of Your heating needs the sun is providing and      lets you compare strategies such as adding insulation or      increasing south glass. You can complete the work sheets      manually or with the computer software version."    </p>    <p>      <strong>SIMPLE SOLAR SOLUTIONS</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      So what are the worst-case consequences if you follow the      basic principles, but don't want to perform your own      detailed energy analysis or hire a professional to do it      for you? Less-than-optimal amounts of south-facing windows      may require running an auxiliary heating system more, or      may necessitate adding another log to the woodstove or      putting on a sweater. Undersized mass will cause winter      daytime overheating, which is easily remedied by opening      windows.    </p>    <p>      A less-than-perfect passive-solar design can be remedied      after construction. What you cannot easily change later is      the basic shape, design and orientation of the house.      That's why a well-insulated, south-facing structure is the      essential foundation for a comfortable passive-solar home.    </p>    <h3>      Resources    </h3>    <p>      <strong>BOOKS AND PLANS</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      The Solar House: Passive Heating and Cooling by Dan Chiras.    </p>    <p>      Sun-inspired Home Plans by Debbie Rucker Coleman.

Most      Americans remain unaware that we have already consumed      nearly half our domestic natural gas. In Texas, energy      companies drill 17 new gas wells a day-6,400 wells      each year-just to maintain current production levels,      say Randy Udall, director of the Community Office for      Resource Efficiency in Aspen, Colorado, and Steve Andrews,      an energy analyst. The United States is now the world's      largest importer of natural gas, most of which comes from      Canada.    </p>    <p>      But just as in Texas, gas production in western Canada is      declining. Twenty new wells are drilled every day just to      keep production from failing, causing Canadians to worry      about future supplies for their own country. Consequently,      some Canadians are balking at increasing their export of      natural gas to their energy-hungry neighbor to the south.      Importing natural gas from any but our land-linked      neighbors will be costly and difficult.<br />    </p>    <p>      Like natural gas, oil production in the United States has      been dropping since 1972. Many energy analysts predict      global oil production will peak between 2005 and 2010. Then      demand will begin to outstrip supply, sending prices up, up      and away.<br />    </p>    <p>      Passive-solar heating provides warmth and comfort, and can      replace declining fossil fuel resources economically, with      a fraction of the environmental impact. Passive-solar      heating is crucial not only to individuals but to the      well-being of the nation and the world economy.    </p>
