                <p>      <strong>Gardeners Almanac</strong>    </p>            <h5 id="byline">      Edited by Carol Mack    </h5>    <p>      <strong>New England and Maritime Canada</strong>    </p>    <p>      Putting up food and saving seed are a priority right now.      Watch for fully mature, dry seedpods and collect them      before they shatter. Spread the seeds out to dry completely      before storing. Finish harvesting garlic and take advantage      of that precious open ground. There is plenty of time to      sow a cover crop, like oats or rye. Or turn in 2 to 4      inches of compost and plant fall greens, such as spinach,      bok choi, arugula, mesclun, corn salad or cilantro. Spinach      planted during the first two weeks of August will grow to      full-size by late September; later plantings will produce      smaller leaves. Clean up early drops from around fruit      trees. Watch for branches overloaded with fruit and support      with props or thin the fruit: Fruit-burdened peach branches      are especially prone to breaking.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mid-Atlantic</strong>    </p>    <p>      Plant lettuce, carrots, beets, radishes, kale, kohlrabi,      turnips, spinach, beans, summer squash and Chinese greens      through August. Switch to cold-tolerant varieties of      lettuce, such as 'Thai Oakleaf 88,' around August 20, and      transplant the last fall brassicas by then. To trap      harlequin bugs next spring, try planting a mix of kale,      turnips and mustard as an edible cover crop. Keep winter      roots weeded through September, and sow spinach, kale,      collards, radishes and Chinese greens weekly. Continue      harvesting summer veggies, using that last burst of summer      harvest to make sure you have enough tomato sauce, salsa      and pickles to last the winter. Steam and freeze surplus      broccoli. Keep strawberries watered and weeded. Plant vetch      and winter rye as a cover crop on bare soil and protect      remaining produce with row cover as October frosts      approach.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southern Interior</strong>    </p>    <p>      Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, collards, cucumber,      kohlrabi, lima beans, mustard, turnip, squash, pumpkin,      rutabaga and early peas can still be planted from seed in      warmer regions. Keep soil moist and shaded with a thick      layer of compost or grass clippings. You may also want to      try transplants of bell peppers and tomatoes and beat the      cold weather with some tasty treats. For rose growers it's      time to fertilize and lightly prune those blooming beauties      to keep them healthy for next season. September is also a      great time for planting pansies for some late-season color.      Speaking of color, if you are planning to plant bulbs for      spring, be sure to order them so you will have them for      planting in October and November.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gulf Coast</strong>    </p>    <p>      Hot August days test your devotion to gardening, but      persevere: Effort now will pay off with bountiful fall      crops later.    </p>    <p>      Make a big batch and freeze it in ice cube trays. Transfer      the pesto cubes from the trays into freezer bags and you're      ready for quick, easy meals of your favorite pasta tossed      with sweet basil and garlic pesto.    </p>    <p>      Transplant tomatoes, bell peppers and brassicas, and plant      collards, mustards, turnips, squash, cucumbers, lima beans,      shallots, Irish potatoes and southern peas. Middle to late      August is a good time to plant carrots, beets, snap beans      and lettuce. In September, add greens and English peas to      the mix, and plant garlic and onions later in the month.      Watch new transplants carefully: Their little roots dry out      easily, and their growth will be significantly retarded by      lack of water. it takes at least two weeks for roots that      were confined to small pots or six-packs to expand enough      to support active growth. Purchase transplants in larger      pots or grow your own to start out with a bigger, healthier      root system.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Central/Midwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      Summer is not over yet! Start cold season vegetables now      for your fall harvest. Lettuce, kale, radish, spinach and      mustard greens can produce through late fall if planted      along the south side of your house or in a cold frame. Add      fall annuals, like pansies, stocks, snapdragons or      flowering kale, for additional color until the snow      arrives. This is the season when powdery mildew, late      blight and other fungal diseases arrive. If these become a      persistent problem despite good sanitation measures, look      for more disease-resistant varieties next year. Plant      spring bulbs and garlic in late September. If this fall is      like recent ones in the Midwest, protecting your plants      from the first few nighttime frosts could allow you two or      three more weeks of growing season.    </p>    <p>      <strong>North Central and Rockies</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Take advantage of hot weather to dry tomatoes for winter      salads. (Softened with a bit of lemon juice and olive oil,      they will be much tastier than any you could buy.) There's      still time to start fall crops of hardy greens, especially      if you pick a sheltered place where they can grow until      November. In August, get a jump on fall cover crops by      interplanting them between corn, carrots and other row      crops. To get better germination in hot, dry weather, try      this trick: Hoe a 4-inch-deep furrow, then soak it with      water before sowing with clover or vetch. Blueberries are      at their best now: Keep them watered and well-protected      from wild "berryvores," both feathered and furred. Prune      out second-year raspberry canes when they're finished      bearing, but wait until after a hard frost to thin and top      the first-year canes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pacific Northwest</strong>		</p>			<p>				Cooler temperatures and      an occasional late summer shower often bring a second      spring to Northwest gardens. Fallharvested, edible pod peas      are sweet and tender, with pickings extending into early      winter. Plant cabbage, broccoli, bok choi and all types of      mustard until midSeptember, covering with lightweight row      covers to exclude cabbage fly and cabbage moth. Sow beets,      spinach, carrots, arugula, lettuce and seasonal delicacies,      such as 'Misato Rose' radish (see "The Other Radishes") ,      corn salad, endive, radicchio, chervil and broccoli raab.      Spread compost or manure on implanted areas or sow      fall-sown cover crops, such as clover, Austrian field peas,      fava beans, vetch and winter wheat. As you cut down summer      annuals and biennials, such as foxglove, hollyhock, poppy      and sweet william, break apart the seed heads and sprinkle      the seeds around. In spring you'll have a good stand of      seedlings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southwest</strong>		</p>		<p>				Garden weeds will gain ground if      you're not diligent about weeding. Keep crops picked to      encourage production and smother weeds with wheat-straw      mulch. Plant fall lettuces, onions, anything in the cabbage      family, garlic, cilantro, peas and even desert wildflowers.      Plant native perennial bunchgrass in any bare, uncultivated      spaces. A single 8-inch-diameter bunchgrass can insulate      the surrounding ground from the summer sun's heat, lowering      the soil's surface temperature by 40 degrees. Revegetation      with local native grasses could have an impact on global      warming, right in your back yard!    </p>    <p>      Our thanks to the following for their contributions to the      Almanac: Roberta Bailey, FEDCO Seeds, Waterville, Maine;      Cricket Rakita, Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, Mineral,      Virginia; Connie DamByl, William Dam Seeds, Dundas,      Ontario; Matt Barthel, Seed Savers Exchange, Decorah, Iowa;      Bill McDorman, Seeds Trust/High Altitude Gardens, Hailey,      Idaho; Josh Kirschenbaum, Territorial Seed Company, Cottage      Grove, Oregon; Rose Marie Nichols McGee, Nichols Garden      Nursery, Albany, Oregon; Craig and Sue Dremann, Redwood      City Seed Co., Redwood City, California; Dean Lollis, Park      Seed Co., Greenwood, South Carolina.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Presto Pesto</strong>		</p>		<p>				If you've never tried classic      Italian pesto for pasta, you're missing out on a fabulous      flavor combination. Basil is one herb that loses some of      its flavor when dried, so pesto is a great way to capture      that unique fresh basil taste.<br />    </p>    <p>      To make pesto, start with a couple of big handfuls of fresh      basil leaves, plus some parsley if you have it. Chop the      herbs in a food processor or blender along with a few      cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup or so of pine nuts (walnuts also      make a fine substitute) and enough olive oil to blend      everything together. You can add the final ingredient,      Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup), or wait and add it when      you use the pesto.    </p>
