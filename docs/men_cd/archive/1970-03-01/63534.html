                        <p>      <em>When in the course of evolution it becomes necessary      for one species to denounce the notion of independence from      all the rest, and to assume among the powers of the earth,      the interdependent station to which the natural laws of the      cosmos have placed them, a decent respect for the opinions      of all mankind requires that they should declare the      conditions which impel them to assert their      interdependence.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>We hold these truths to be self-evident that all      species have evolved with equal and unalienable rights,      that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of      happiness. That to insure these rights, nature has      instituted certain principles for the sustenence of all      species, deriving these principles from the capabilities of      the planet's life-support system. That whenever any      behavior by members of one species becomes destructive of      these principles, it is the function of other members of      that species to alter or abolish such irrelevant behavior      and to reestablish the theme of interdependence with all      life, in such a form and in accordance with those natural      principles that will effect their safety and happiness.      Prudence, indeed, will dictate that cultural values long      established should not be altered for light and transient      causes, that mankind is more disposed to suffer from      asserting a vain notion of independence than to right      themselves by abolishing that culture to which they are now      accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations      of these principles of interdependence, evinces a subtle      design to reduce them, through absolute despolation of the      planet's fertility, to a state of ill will, bad health, and      great anxiety, it is their right, it is their duty, to      throw off such notions of independence from other species      and from the life-support system and to provide new guards      for the reestablishment of security, and maintenance of      these principles. Such has been the quiet and patient      sufferage of all species, and such is now the necessity      which constrains the species homo sapiens to reassert the      principles of interdependence. The history of the present      notion of independence is a history of repeated injuries      and usurpations all having in direct effect the      establishment of an absolute tyranny over life. To prove      this let facts be submitted to a candid world.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>• People are proliferating in .such an      irresponsible manner as to threaten the survival of all      species. • People have refused to recognize that they      are interacting with other species in an evolutionary      process.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>• People have fouled the waters that all life      drinks of and they have fouled the air that all life      partakes of.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>• People have transformed the face of the earth to      enhance their notion of independence from it and in so      doing have interrupted many natural processes that they are      dependent upon. • People have contaminated the common      household with substances that are foreign to the life      processes which are causing many organisms great      difficulties. • People have massacred and extincted      fellow species for their feathers and fur, for their skins      and tusks. • People have persecuted most persistantly      those known as coyote, lion, wolf, and fox because of their      dramatic role in the expression of interdependence. •      People have warred upon one another which has brought great      sorrow to themselves and vast destruction to the homes and      the food supplies of many living things.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>• People have denied others the right to live to      completion their interdependencies to the full extent of      their capabilities. We therefore, among the mortal      representatives of the eternal process of life and      evolutionary principles, in mutual humbleness, explicitly      stated, appealing to the ecological consciousness of the      world for the rectitude of our intentions, do solemnly      publish and declare that all species are interdependent,      that they are all free to realize, these relationships to      the full extent of their capabilities; that each species is      subservient to the requirements of the natural processes      that sustain all life. And for the support of this      declaration with a firm reliance on all other members of      our species who understand their consciousness as a      capability, to assist all of us and our brothers to      interact in order to realize a life process that manifests      its maximum potential of diversity, vitality and planetary      fertility to ensure the continuity of life on earth.</em>    </p>        <p>      The Declaration of Interdependence, written by Thomas      Jefferson and Cliff Humphrey and many delegates is      available in poster form (17"x22") for $1 from:    </p>    <p>      Ecology Action P.O.
