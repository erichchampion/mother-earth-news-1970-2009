        <p>NOT long after Ed and I moved into our country house I began to realize <em>my</em> department was going to be overcrowded.</p><p>One look at our big quick freezer, the cream separator, the honey extractor, the pressure canner - and another look at our small kitchen and we were somehow reminded of trying to get a grand piano into a phone booth!</p><p>You see, when you begin to grow a good part of your food you need a "factory" to process it and preserve it. And you just <em>live</em> differently. The ordinary kitchen-dining room combination of the conventional house simply doesn't fit.</p><p>What you need is a streamlined, modern little food-conserving set-up, combined with the charm and warmth of Grandmother's kitchen.</p><p>We went to John Whitney, an architect who specializes in country houses, with our idea. Together we planned out every detail of food preservation, preparation and serving; added such things as the greenhouse window (for winter herbs, flowers, and spring plant starting), a desk and record-keeping corner and a rocking chair corner or relaxation, darning and sewing and general coziness.</p><p>And now we have our "Harvest Kitchen." It has turned out lovelier and more practical than our fondest dreams. Believe me, if you want to make cooking, canning and freezing a joy for your wife build her a "Harvest Kitchen!"</p><p>You can add it to any house; you can put it into <em>new-house</em> plans; sometimes you can convert your present dining room and kitchen into this needed "Harvest Room" or "Harvest Kitchen" as we call it.</p><p>In our "Harvest Kitchen" (see pictures at right) we have such features as a greenhouse window, special milk-handling and cooling equipment, quick-freezer cabinet, hardwood chopping block for meat and poultry dressing, vegetable-cleaning sink, glass-enclosed preserved and canned food compartments, garbage-handling arrangement, dry food storage space, cooking, canning and work space, etc.</p><p>Isn't it astounding that such a room has never been designed, not even for a <em>farmhouse?</em></p>

The big roomy old farm kitchen was its ""ancestor"" - yet it is completely new in design and conception. We call it the ""Harvest Kitchen.""
