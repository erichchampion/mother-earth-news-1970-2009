    <p>
                        <p>      WHEN you      start producing food for your family, money will begin to      lose its importance. You won't be digging into your pockets      every time you turn around. First, you yourself will be      producing a good part of your food and secondly, you'll be      trading your surplus with your neighbors.    </p>    <p>      For example, we trade geese for turkeys with one of our      neighbors, Tyler Long. Ty and his father have always had a      hankering to raise turkeys. For a long time they just      talked about it, then a couple of years ago they started in      doing it.    </p>    <p>      Unlike a lot of people, including a few farmers I've met,      they were frank with themselves in admitting to begin with      that they didn't <em>really</em> know much about turkey      raising. They determined to find out all about the newest      and best ways of going ahead, start on a small scale. So      they talked to any number of commercial turkey men, our      county agent, and read everything they could get their      hands on about turkeys.    </p>    <p>      Just to give you an idea of how well they've done, in 1942      the national turkey mortality rate from all causes was      reported to be 28%. In 1943, when feed conditions were at      their worst in 20 years, Ty kept his mortality rate down to      15%.    </p>    <p>      While it's true that scientific turkey raising requires      certain precautions not always necessary in chicken      raising, if a few general principles are followed with      care, turkeys can be a surprisingly easy, inexpensive and      interesting way of increasing your food supply. Turkeys      incidentally, produce more meat per pound of feed than      almost any other kind of poultry.    </p>    <p>      We say this after observing Ty Long's experience raising      turkeys. In fact; we have gotten him to give detailed, week      by week, instructions, explaining exactly how a family can      scientifically raise a dozen or so turkeys.    </p>    <h3>      What Breed?    </h3>    <p>      By no means try to hatch out turkeys from eggs - buy      day-old chicks or poults as they are actually called. Place      your order early, sometime between December and March. The      importance of good breeding in the day-old poults cannot be      stressed too much.    </p>    <p>      Ty recommends buying them from a well-recommended      <em>breeder</em> rather than from a hatchery. You can get      names from the magazine, <em>Turkey World,</em> (Mount      Morris, III., 15c a copy) or consult your county agent.      Don't decide on a breeder farther away than 300 miles,      preferably closer. Specify shipment by Railway Express.    </p>    <p>      Most breeders specialize in Broad Breasted Bronzes - they      give more meat per pound of frame. This is a good breed to      start with, unless you want one of the smaller breeds. If,      for your family use, you'd like to wind up with eight or      ten fully grown turkeys, you'd best order 15 poults. Poults      sell for from $.50 to $.75 apiece. These 15 will probably      narrow down to twelve for the cage and eight or ten for      your family and friends. You may, of course, do much better      than this, in which case you can easily sell your surplus      at a nice little profit.    </p>    <p>      Poor sanitation and dampness, huddling caused by improper      heat control, and failure to start eating are the greatest      causes of death in young poults. Because a battery brooder      provides a maximum of sanitation and dryness, practically      eliminates huddling, and its confined quarters are a big      help in starting poults eating, we believe a battery is the      easiest and safest way to raise your turkeys for the first      four weeks. Equally important, a battery brooder reduces      labor to a minimum.    </p>    <p>      Here are Tyler Long's week-by-week instructions. Don't let      their seemingly lengthy detail discourage you. It's really      easier than it sounds, and, besides, Ty is more of a      "perfectionist" than most of us are likely to be.    </p>    <h3>      Week-By-Week Instructions    </h3>    <p>      These instructions are not intended to be absolute. We feel      that reasonable appli cation of them plus common sense      circumstances not discussed in this short article will      result in your successfully raising your turkeys.    </p>    <p>      <strong>From First Day To Fourth Week</strong>    </p>    <p>      At least 2 days before the poults come, <em>completely</em>      scrub battery, inside and out, feeders and waterers with      hot soapy water. Rinse with hot water. Spray with a warm 4%      solution of any reliable coal-tar disinfectant. Only then      will your poults be reasonably safe from germs left by the      battery's former inmates. Be sure all surfaces are      thoroughly dry before the poults come in contact with them.      Cover dropping board with newspaper to facilitate      <em>daily</em> removal of droppings.    </p>    <p>      At least 4 hours before poults' arrival regulate      temperature under hover (using brooder thermometer or      thermostat) to between 95° and 105°. Reduce to      90° the third day. Thereafter a drop of 5° per week      is usually advisable. However, behaviour of birds      themselves is best barometer of their comfort. Cold poults      usually huddle (their most dangerous habit), peep loudly      and protestingly. Overheated poults act drugged and      listless. Comfortable poults either sleep quietly or peep      in a low, contented voice. Above all guard against      huddling. More poults die in the first four weeks from      smothering caused by huddling than from any other single      cause.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, it's just as important to remember that      over-heating the birds at any stage of the game tends to      produce a delicate, over-sensitive turkey. It is usually      best for the first two or three nights to wake up at 1 or 2      a.m. to see that turkeys are comfortable. This is a chore,      but a necessary one, since as many as 50% of your poults      can be killed in one night by huddling.    </p>    <p>      Before placing your poults in their new quarters, fill the      hoppers almost to overflowing with a turkey starter mash      from a reputable feed concern. (If the mash is not Vitamin      D fortified, add and mix thoroughly 1% Cod Liver oil until      the birds are out in the sun.) Sprinkle about one      teaspoonful of fine hard chick grit to each three poults on      top of the mash, so that they will get their "teeth" with      their first meal. Continue giving this grit twice weekly      until the tenth week. Fill the waterers with water the      temperature of your hand. Continue for two weeks, then      change to tap water. Keep both feeders and waterers filled      to this level until poults can reach down into them.    </p>    <p>      Some of your poults may refuse to eat when you first get      them. Put down a newspaper and scatter on it some chick      scratch. Usually they will peck at this. Next day put chick      scratch on top of mash in feeders.    </p>    <p>      Wash the waterer every day in hot soapy water. Keep it      filled with fresh, clean water. Wash feeders every ten      days. Stir old feed in with new to prevent any becoming      stale.Inspect your poults upon arrival, culling out any      malformed, injured, or dying ones. The simplest, most      humane method is to snap the neck with a quick, strong      twist of the hand. The same treatment should always be      accorded any deathly sick or badly injured birds as a      protective measure for the rest of your flock. However,      like chickens, no disease or injury to which a turkey is      susceptible can in any way render the flesh unfit for human      consumption. But any birds that are to be eaten should be      killed so that they will bleed.    </p>        <h3>      Disease Control    </h3>    <p>      Baby turkeys are subject to a number of diseases, the most      prevalent of which are coccidiosis and brooder pneumonia.      The former is usually recognizable by bloody droppings and      a general washed-out look to the bird. Pneumonia can      sometimes be detected by the presence of phlegm in the      nasal passage and some shivering. In each case the poult      must be segregated from the others, kept warm and dry and      fed warm milk, with an eye-dropper, if necessary. Nothing      more can be done in the case of brooder pneumonia. The      development of coccidiosis is sometimes arrested by      administering a 1% solution of Epsom salts. This must be      followed in six hours by dried skim milk mixed with the      mash or water. Commercial anti-coccidiosis agents are      sometimes found helpful. Never return the sick bird to its      regular quarters until you are fairly certain a cure has      been effected - you must not risk infecting the others.      (Lederle's Sulfaguanidine, a new "sulfa" drug, has      frequently halted rampages of coccodiosis when other      measures failed.    </p>    <p>      Keep a weather eye out for the condition known as      "pasting-up", when the poult's droppings remain stuck to      his backside. This is serious, as a poult (or chick) can      die very quickly from the poisons caused by a clogged-up      intestinal tract. Treatment we found safest: With a      medicine dropper apply several drops of inexpensive mineral      oil on and around the dropping, which will soon be worked      off. <em>Do not</em> try to remove it; the poult's      sensitive skin is easily injured.    </p>    <h3>      From Fifth To Tenth Week    </h3>    <p>      The advantages of raising turkeys in battery brooders will      turn into serious disadvantages if the birds are kept in      them after the four week period. Many growers leave poults      in batteries only 16 days. The fact that the birds are      allowed to develop neither immunity to disease-bearing      bacteria nor resistance to less favorable climatic      conditions in its protecting confines is responsible for      this. Therefore, at least at the start of the fifth week      the poults should be moved to a clean, dry, thoroughly      disinfected floor covered with at least an inch of good      quality shredded litter, preferably sugar cane shavings.      The average temperature, at the floor, of their new      quarters (section of garage, barn, enclosed porch, small      brooder house, etc), should be somewhere between a minimum      of 65° and a maximum of 75°. If it is not possible      to use the top-section of your battery as their hover (in      which case you would remove the dropping board, floor grid,      removable sides, feeders and waterer, using it only as a      source of heat and shelter on top of the litter), build or      buy a small auxiliary hover. (See Chapter on Broilers).    </p>    <p>      Such a hover, which can be quite simply constructed of      insulation board with either 2 or 3 25-watt bulbs or a      commercial heating element installed in the roof, must be      large enough and adjustable in height so as to accommodate      all the birds when they are ten weeks old, at which time      they should be more than twice the size they were at four.      The temperature should be gradually reduced (if necessary,      vary the number and size of the bulbs) so that the birds      get little artificial heat for the next to the last two      weeks and none whatever during the last two weeks.      Important considerations in selecting the poults' new      quarters are adequate ventilation facilities and a good      supply of sunlight, at times directly on the birds, if      possible. Be careful about direct drafts on the birds for      the first 3 weeks in new quarters. It would be much to your      advantage if you could provide the turkeys with direct      access to the air and sun in a small, fine gravel-covered      yard or wire-covered cage connected with their new      quarters. To accustom the poults to outside temperatures      and breezes, be sure to leave all ventilation facilities      wide open for the last ten days and nights.    </p>    <p>      Litter should be thoroughly stirred every other day and      completely changed weekly. This is necessary both to combat      germs and to keep their walking surface dry, a point of      great importance.    </p>    <p>      It is also important to keep the waterers on three-inch      high wire platforms to prevent contamination. Mash should      now be fed in a regular chick hopper, water in a one or two      quart glass or metal chick waterer. Finely chopped tender      green-stuff (lettuce, spinach, orange, cabbage, grass,      clover, etc.) can now be fed the poults to great advantage.      Scatter moderate amounts each day on top of their mash.      Otherwise, feed, grit and water conditions remain as      before. (8th week-start to mix <em>growing</em> mash with      starter. Gradually increase to all growing, 10th week)    </p>    <p>      From the sixth week on, a careful watch must be kept for      the most dread of all turkey illness, "blackhead." (For      identification and treatment of this and other turkey      diseases get the Dept. of Agriculture's Bulletin 1652      <em>Diseases and Parasites of Poultry.)</em> Sanitation and      segregation of infected birds is your best weapon in      fighting both blackhead and coccidiosis. Lederle's      Phenothiazine has arrested many epidemics of blackheads,      but cannot be guaranteed as a positive cure. If any signs      of lice are detected a very light sprinkling of drops of      "Black Leaf 40" wherever the birds bed down, be i t litter      or roost, will rid them of the torments and dangers of      lice.    </p>    <h3>      From Tenth Week To Maturity    </h3>    <p>      By the tenth week, under normal conditions, your poults      should move to their permanent outside quarters. However,      if poor feed or other circumstances prevent normal      development or if the weather is unfavorable, it would be      best to delay the transfer for a short time. These      permanent quarters should consist of a solidly built      wire-floored four foot high cage, with its base thirty      inches off the ground and supported by pine or fir 4 x 4's      whose bases have been dipped in creosote.    </p>        <p>      If possible, open face of roost enclosure should face      south. Sides and top of the cage may be constructed with      lath or 2" poultry netting. Great caution should be      exercised in eliminating all possible surfaces on the floor      where droppings can collect. Bevel 2" x 3"'s (on the top)      so that they will just hold staples 18" apart for the 1" by      2" flooring. A door should be placed on any side of the      cage not taken up by the feed hoppers. Eliminate all sharp      points or surfaces where the turkeys might injure      themselves.    </p>    <p>      By this time a complete change from starting to growing      mash should take place. Continue feeding chopped greens      whenever possible. The grit, still lightly sprinkled on top      of the mash twice weekly, should now be changed to broiler      size. Starting with the 12th week broiler scratch,      consisting preferably, of cracked corn, oats and wheat,      should be fed in approximately one-quarter of the hopper      space, boxed off from the rest. By the 20th week this      should have been gradually increased to half the hopper      space. Also near the 20th week the grit should be changed      to full-sized and the scratch, consisting of the same      ingredients, to full-size. Gradually increase the      percentage of grain to mash until by the 20th week the      birds are eating 50% of each. At this time it would make      for a better finished turkey if you can make the scratch      mixture 70% to 80% corn. It is possible, the last few      weeks, to increase the consumption of feed by feeding a      moist mash, made by mixing hot water on top of the dry mash      in hoppers. However, care should be taken that none of the      dry feed becomes sour. Remember the principle of finishing      turkeys is to stuff them with as much feed of high caloric      value as is possible.    </p>    <p>      An ailment known as perosis or "slipped tendon" is more      prevalent in turkeys from the tenth week on, but it      sometimes occurs earlier. Usually hereditary or nutritional      in origin, perosis is sometimes introduced through      infection. The trouble is easily recognized by the severe      lameness and crookedness of one or both of the victim's      legs. For treatment see the Farmer's Bulletin of poultry      disease, No. 1652.    </p>    <p>      Your turkeys are ready to kill when they have a fine layer      of fat covering the entire body (shown by a white or      yellowish appearance of the skin, rather than the purple      tint of the muscle tissue) and when at least 95% of the      pinfeathers have disappeared. This usually takes from 24 to      28 weeks, but any number of circumstances can delay the      finishing. If you want your turkeys to be the best you ever      tasted, you'll just have to be patient. A well finished      Broad Breasted Bronze tom should weigh a minimum of 18      pounds and often as high as 26 and 28. The hen (whose flesh      is <em>not</em> of a quality superior to the tom's) should      weigh from 12 to 16 or 17 pounds.    </p>    <p>      A smaller breed will weigh proportionately less. During      starving time, 18 hours before killing, provide plenty of      fresh water.    </p>    <h3>      Killing and Picking    </h3>    <p>      For a turkey slaughterer of amateur standing, decapitation      with a sharp axe or machete is quickest, easiest.      Immediately after the head has been severed, the bird      should be elevated so blood is allowed to drip for about      ten minutes. The plucking should take place immediately      after the blood has stopped dripping. Again, the simplest      method of plucking for amateurs is the semi-scald dip.      Using a large vessel similar to a wash tub and a cooking      thermometer to assure a temperature about 175°, the      entire body of the turkey should be immersed for about      40-50 seconds. The feathers should come out with great      ease; if not, dip again. It may be necessary to use gloves      or pliers on certain of the wing and tail feathers. After      the bird has been completely plucked, it should be hung by      feet in a room with a temperature from 30° to 40°,      and preferably, a relatively high humidity. If there is any      food in the crop, the entire crop should be removed through      a neat 3" incision in the front of the neck. Sew this up to      prever.t drying out and squeeze the vent to remove any      droppings that may be there.    </p>    <p>      The turkey may be cleaned and roasted at any time after two      days of chilling have passed; if the temperature and      humidity are correct he may be kept up to -10 days. We      recommend that you take your first bird to be cleaned to      the butcher in order that you may learn the tricks of the      trade directly from him.    </p>    <h3>      Points To Remember    </h3>    <p>      In conclusion, here is a digest of the cardinal principles      of scientific turkey raising. 1) Sanitation and dryness are      your most efficient weapons against disease. 2) Never      overcrowd your birds at any stage of their development.      Always provide more space rather than less. 3) Never allow      your turkeys to come in contact with chickens or any other      poultry. Keep them as far from other fowl as possible. If      the turkeys are to live in any shelter formerly used by      other poultry always thoroughly disinfect those quarters.      If there has been any disease there, always fumigate with      formaldehyde and potassium permanganate. 4) Always allow      adequate space at the feeders and waterers. This means that      every bird should be able to eat at the same time and four      birds should be able to drink at the same time. 5) Remember      that turkeys are but recently descended from their parental      wild stock - avoid all unnecessary loud noises, sudden      movements and other disquieting influences, since they are      much more timid and easily frightened than other poultry.      6) Always slip on rubbers or different shoes when going      into the turkey shelter, so as to reduce the possibilities      of infection from your chickens. Do not allow any visitors      into area where turkeys walk.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Suggested Reading:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Starting Right With Turkeys"</em> , ($2.75), by G.

Roosts should be built in the sheltered end of the cage, using 2-by-4's with wide side as the roosting surface and allowing 14"" space per bird. Top of roosts should be 20"" from the wire floor and a space of 24"" should separate one roost from another. Allow the birds complete access to the floor under the roosts, otherwise you cut their exercise area to the bone. A slanting roof of very heavy roofing paper and three sides of the same material (removed in above photo) should protect the roosting section.
