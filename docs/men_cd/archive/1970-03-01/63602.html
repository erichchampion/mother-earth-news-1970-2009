    <p>
                    <p>      NOW we come to a part of the "Have-More" Plan that probably      gives Ed and me the most satisfaction of all-preserving      food in various ways so that we "live off the fat of the      land" all year round.    </p>    <p>      Food preservation also has very practical compensations.      Vegetables cleaned and prepared in the summer or fall save      hours of shopping and of preparation in the kitchen during      months to come. Furthermore, home preserved food costs      less. For example, our home preserved tomatoes cost us      about 5 cents per quart.    </p>    <p>      Folks today are lucky to have two wonderful modern ways of      conserving food: quick freezing and pressure canning -      besides that dependable old stand-by, the root cellar. One      obvious rule applies to them all: use only the best of your      fruits and vegetables, those just ripe and free from      blemishes. If you take tough old string beans and freeze or      can them, you're still going to have tough old beans. At      first it hurts to throw away even one bean you've raised.      But it isn't long before you realize you have plenty of the      best and you can afford to give the few tough ones to the      pigs or chickens.    </p>    <p>      If you want to keep your preserving to a minimum, enjoy      your food to the fullest extent while it is at the height      of its season instead of trying to have something different      every day of the week. We certainly do not get tired of      eating sweet corn nearly every day for weeks when it comes      fresh from our own garden.    </p>    <p>      To show you how we have a lot of variety in our home-grown      food with the least effort, here is a list of foods we      emphasized, each in season. We don't claim we ate only      these items at these times, but we used them primarily - we      supplement our home-grown list with things we don't grow,      for instance, seafood, beef, etc.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUMMER</strong> (July-September)    </p>    <p>      Fresh garden vegetables - tomatoes, peas, string beans,      lima beans, beets, corn, cucumbers, lettuce, summer squash,      egg-plant, new potatoes, etc. Fresh fruits, raspberries,      strawberries, blackberries, etc. Broilers, roasters,      rabbit. All kinds of frozen meat (from winter killing).      Milk, butter, cottage cheese, eggs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FALL</strong> (October-December)    </p>    <p>      Root cellar vegetables - cabbage, beets, carrots, turnips,      Hubbard and acorn squash, potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes      (leave in ground). Greens still in garden: kale, broccoli,      chinese cabbage, collards. Stored fruits - apples and      pears. Baked beans and stews. Chicken, fricassee or pies      (culled hens), broilers and roasters. Other fowl - (geese,      turkeys, ducks). Lamb, chevon, rabbit. Milk, eggs, cheese.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WINTER</strong> (January-March)    </p>    <p>      Vegetables and fruits - rest of those stored in the root      cellar - some canned and frozen vegetables, fruits. Fresh      pork or chevon, smoked hams and shoulders, sausage, bacon.      Frozen or fresh chicken. Other fowl (as you cull). Rabbit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPRING</strong> (April-June)    </p>    <p>      Vegetables and fruits - canned or frozen. Spring garden      greens, such as dandelions, beet tops, asparagus. Fresh      rhubarb. Jerusalem artichokes, and parsnips left in garden      over winter. Radishes, lettuce. Hams and bacon (cured in      winter). Baked beans. Broilers, frozen or fresh. Other      meats from freezer. Milk and eggs.    </p>    <p>      While we're making lists, here's one you'll find helpful in      deciding whether to store, can, freeze or dehydrate the      various vegetables from your garden.    </p>    <p>      <em>Easy Storage:</em> potatoes, carrots, beets, onions,      winter squash, turnips.    </p>    <p>      <em>Best for Freezing:</em> all meats and poultry, snap      beans, shell beans, lima beans, asparagus, peas, corn, all      greens and berries.    </p>    <p>      <em>Best to Can:</em> tomatoes, snap beans, shell beans,      soy beans, peas, corn and some fruits depending on your own      likes.    </p>    <p>      <em>Most Successfully Dried:</em> soy beans, lima beans,      kidney beans, peas, corn, onions, some fruits.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Cold Storage or Root Cellar</strong></p><p> It so happens      that the old trick of putting away root vegetables and some      fruits in a cool, moist place is both easy and cheap and      for certain things the best way to store.    </p>    <p>      The necessary conditions are a cool, moist atmosphere      (temperature 35° up to 45°), darkness, and      protection from rats and mice.    </p>    <p>      We are unfortunate in having a very small basement. What we      would have liked is a cellar storage section about 10' x 6'      and at least 6' high, for standing room and plenty of shelf      space. A section of the basement can be walled off with      economical concrete blocks or insulating board. Good      insulation and a close-fitted insulated door are most      important, especially if you have a furnace in the      basement. A small window is also necessary in order to      control the temperature within the storage unit. An earthen      floor is best - it gives your storage the proper humidity.      If you have a cement floor you must sprinkle it with water      every day or two, or keep a bucket of water in the room. In      basement storage it is also best to pack carrots, beets,      and other root vegetables (except potatoes) in a barrel or      crock with damp leaves or sand.    </p>    <p>      But don't hurry your harvesting to put the vegetables in      storage. It is the early part of the storage period that is      most dangerous. It's hard to get the temperature down to      40° or less when the weather is still warm so leave      root crops in the soil until the ground is almost ready to      freeze. Tomatoes, onions, squash and pumpkins, of course,      have to come in before the first killing frost.    </p>    <p>      Squash, pumpkins and dry beans keep best in the attic, if      you're lucky enough to have one that's <em>warm</em> and      dry. Onions should be kept <em>cool</em> and dry.    </p>    <p>      Lettuce, spinach, broocoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts,      collards, kale and Chinese cabbage are hardy enough to      survive light frosts and can even be left in the garden      long after frosts if they are given protection with straw.      We have been surprised how long you can eat right out of      your garden, even in our cold New England climate. At times      we have had some of these hardy vegetables in the garden      until December. We've found, too, you can save your      full-sized green tomatoes - just pull up the whole vine      before the first frost and hang, or store the tomatoes in      small baskets. They will gradually ripen if kept in a warm      (not hot!)place.    </p>    <p>      But don't make one mistake we did! We didn't weed out the      poor specimens at first and we lost a lot of our precious      vegetables.    </p>    <p>      Bank storage space if you have a hill handy-can be made      with concrete or heavy lumber walls and ceiling. It should      be at least 6' x 5' x 5' high and covered with 3 feet of      dirt. No extra moisture or damp packing is necessary. In      fact, getting plenty of drainage is the main problem along      with keeping out vermin.    </p>    <p>      There are other methods of storage: sinking a barrel      upright in the ground which is not too satisfactory because      it holds so little. Another is the trench method which is      simply digging a trench below frost and lining with straw;      vegetables are then added, and all is covered. Obviously,      it's not easy digging vegetables out and you can't check up      on them easily.    </p>    <p>      For people with small cellars like us or for those of you      who are planning new houses with radiant heating (which      doesn't require expensive cellar space), it might be      possible to have shed-type storage space attached to the      garage. Of course, the walls would have to be insulated, as      with the other methods, and the thickness would have to be      determined by the material you used. We have not tested out      this idea but it would seem to be a workable plan.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, cold storage is such an easy way to conserve      food that it is probably the first method you will want to      take advantage of.    </p>    <h3>Hub of The Homestead THE FREEZER</h3>    <p>      If you could take a peek in our freezer today, or any day,      you would see an amazing, wonderful assortment of delicious      foods. For on our miniature farm, nearly all activities      lead to the freezer. Into it goes almost any thing and      everything we can raise, plus items we buy. And the food      comes out fresh whenever we want it - summer or winter. No      other method of preserving food has ever made such a happy      situation possible.    </p>    <p>      From the standpoint of abundance, we have eaten better on      our homestead than we ever have before - and that includes      the war years of scarcity and rationing. The chicken we      take out of our freezer is tender, delicious. Yes, we have      corn-on-the-cob and lush raspberries in January, and      goodtasting greens as well as lots of other things from our      past year's garden . . . and it tastes as good as it did      fresh out of the garden.    </p>    <p>      Ed and I both believe the quick-freezer is one answer to      man's long search for a way to harness the bounty of      nature. At any rate, we know it's a way ordinary people      like us can have more security and independence than we      ever thought possible.    </p>        <p>      The freezer was one of the first big capital investments we      made and after using it, it would still be the first if we      were starting over again. Ed loves to say that if you want      to get your wife interested in homesteading, just get her a      freezer. I must admit it helped intrigue me with country      living and now I'm glad it did, for I would never go back      to the city.    </p>    <p>      A freezing cabinet cuts your cost of living and at the same      time raises your standard of living. Even if you did not      raise any of your own food you could buy fresh vegetables,      fruits or meat in quantities at wholesale or seasonal      prices and store them away. The cabinet should eventually      pay for itself from your savings in such buying. It costs      very little to run a freezer - about the same as an      electric refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you raise your own food the savings are even      greater. If you hunt or fish, you can put away some of your      favorite wild duck or fresh trout for the time you couldn't      otherwise enjoy such delicacies. Or you can even make some      good trades with your friends - we have swapped some of our      home grown fowl and meat for such tasty things as newly dug      clams, fresh fish and that rare treat, venison.    </p>    <p>      You already know that in comparison with canned foods, many      frozen foods taste better, look better and have more food      value. We have even found that vegetables and fruits frozen      immediately after picking are better than the so-called      "fresh" stuff you buy in the market. When you stop to think      how many hundreds or thousands of miles an out-of-season      tomato or cauliflower travels to meet you you realize that      the word "fresh" may mean a variety of things.    </p>    <p>      As a home-maker I have found there are many, many pleasures      connected with our freezer besides its unequalled service      in preserving foods. A freezer saves a tremendous amount of      shopping time because you have your own little storehouse      of vegetables, fruits and <em>meats</em> , ready to use. If      you find you need a lot of fresh bread and don't make your      own, you simply buy a large quantity and freeze it. What's      more, you can freeze stale bread and when it defrosts, it's      fresh again. Practically a miracle, isn't it?    </p>    <p>      A freezer has fascinating possibilities. Every fall we      freeze lots of sweet apple cider at a cost of 2 cents a      quart for morning fruit juice, or it's elegant for hot,      mulled cider on a winter's evening. Also when I make stews,      soups or home-baked beans, it's just about as easy to cook      double or triple the amount needed and freeze some for      future use. You can also freeze cakes and pies - or the      dough to be used for pies and cookies. There seems to be no      limit as to what a freezer can do.    </p>    <p>      If you are preserving your own foods, you'll find that      freezing is far easier than canning. To show you how simple      it is, here are the steps involved in freezing green peas:    </p>    <p>      1. Pick the peas from your garden.    </p>    <p>      2. Shell and wash the peas, discarding old or imperfect      ones.    </p>    <p>      3. Blanch peas. That simply means placing peas in a      colander or wire basket and immersing them in rapidly      boiling water (at least a gallon to a pound of peas) for      one minute. Then immediately immerse peas in cold running      water.    </p>    <p>      5. Drain and pour peas in to a moisture-vapor-proof bag or      container and seal.    </p>        <p>      Quick freezing fruits is absurdly simple. Take strawberries      for instance. Remove stems, wash, cover with sugar syrup,      package, freeze. When it comes to meats, it's nothing at      all once the meat is cleaned and cut, ready for cooking.      Just wrap and freeze.    </p>    <p>      There is a wide assortment of containers made especially      for freezing - that is, vapor and moisture proof. I won't      describe these here, for you will have to get a bulletin or      book with complete directions if you are going to freeze      foods.    </p>    <p>      We bought our freezer shortly before Pearl Harbor and paid      $440 for it. It is a 13 cubic foot cabinet and holds      approximately 700 pounds of food. The price we paid was      high, but few freezers had been made at the time we bought      ours. Now, many large companies are building them, with      mass production the price is lower; $230 for one similar to      ours.    </p>    <p>      Many people have been using frozen food lockers which have      rented for $6-$15 a year. If the locker plant is situated      conveniently to your home, you may prefer this method of      having a frozen food supply. A locker plant usually offers      the convenience, of packaging and cutting meat for you and      also provides a place to hang and cool meat before      freezing.    </p>    <p>      However, I personally prefer a quick-freezer at home where      I can tuck away a few boxes of fruits or vegetables or a      small quantity of meat as I find time to prepare them. When      you are raising large quantities of your own food, it may      become practical to use both a home freezer and a locker,      as you would then have the convenience of both      arrangements. Or another plan would be to build (or have      built) your own freezer room and cool room.    </p>    <p>      From our own experience we have learned several things      about buying and running a freezer. We made a serious      mistake in placing our freezing cabinet in our garage where      the temperature drops below freezing in the winter. We      discovered that such low temperatures prevent the motor      from operating properly, so we now have it in our "Harvest      Room." After having our freezer break down once and losing      some of our hard-earned foods, we know now that there      should be some signal to warn you when the temperature      rises above the danger point. There should also be      instructions fastened on the freezer to tell you when and      where to oil the motor. These things we learned from our      one bitter lesson and we wanted to pass them along. It pays      to buy a good cabinet from a reputable dealer and with so      many new designs developed during the war years it will be      wise to look over a number of freezers before choosing      yours. Whatever your intentions are on using a freezer, we      would certainly recommend getting one with a special      compartment for quick-freezing your own food.    </p>    <p>      We certainly believe that food freez ers widely distributed      will make as phenomenal a change in this country as did low      priced cars. With a good freezer and a little piece of land      you can be just about as independent and as secure as you      wish. The freezer can be the secret of one goal all we      Americans constantly work for - freedom from want. Anyhow,      that's what our freezer means to us.    </p>   <h3>Home Canning</h3>    <p>      When guests come in unexpectedly for meals, Mrs. R. can      serve a wonderful dinner on short order, complete with      half-a-dozen meat choices, corn-on-the-cob, and fresh      strawberry shortcake. If you want to interest your wife in      home food production, plan to get her a quick freezer.    </p>    <p>      There was a time when practically every article written on      canning started out with the old saw - "Eat what you can -      and can what you can't."    </p>    <p>      Today, that's so far from reality it isn't even funny. Of      course, you eat all you want during July, August, September      and October directly from the garden. Then, as we've      pointed out, it's easiest to utilize a root cellar. Next is      preservation by freezing - if you're lucky enough to be      able to use this wonderful new method. Then comes canning.    </p>    <p>      In all frankness, it is best to preserve certain things in      glass jars - tomatoes, sauerkraut, pickles, stewed fruits,      preserves and jelly. But canning, even with a pressure      cooker, is more difficult than freezing and the results,      minus the exceptions noted, are, we think, inferior to      freezing.    </p>    <p>      I will say that the savings in canning your own fruits and      vegetables instead of buying them is tremendous. I know      that's contrary to what we've been told, but it's true      because you do it all on your own place-you don't pay for      all the traveling raw vegetables do to get to a factory and      back in cans to grocery shelves. Take the popular tomato as      an example - here is the cost of our 75 quarts of home      canned tomatoes the b est we can figure it:    </p>        <p>      75 quarts commercially sell at 22 cents each - $16.50 Our      Savings; 80%.    </p>    <p>      And we do not blush at saying our tomatoes are superior to      what you can buy in taste, color and texture!    </p>    <p>      Prejudice had been built up against home canning by making      it appear to be a back-breaking complicated chore. But we      have found it fun by doing only a few jars each day in the      summer instead of trying to do it all in a few days. It is      pretty simple, especially with the help of the booklets put      out by the canning jar companies. We happen to have a Kerr      booklet (Kerr Glass Manufacturing Co., Huntington, W. Va.)      which cost 10 cents and which led us successfully through      all our canning, though neither Ed nor I had ever canned      before.    </p>    <p>      Canning is not complicated but it does require accuracy. To      make the work easier, get all your equipment ready to use      before you actually prepare the food. And by all means do      your preparatory work in a pleasant place. At first we did      ours on our back terrace, but now we have our delightful      "Harvest Room."    </p>    <p>      It is usually suggested that you plan 100 quarts of fruit      and vegetables for each member of your family, but if you      are seriously trying to be self-sufficient and are      preserving food only by canning we believe you would want      somewhat more. However, the first year aim for the 100 and      the next year you'll be able to adjust the amount to your      own needs. The 100 quarts should be approximately divided      into one-third fruits, one-third vegetables and one-third      tomatoes or tomato juice.    </p>    <p>      That figure sounds rather forbidding doesn't it, from the      standpoint of quantity and time to preserve? Let's take up      the question of quantity. In the case of apples, one bushel      produces about 20 quarts; cherries, 24 quarts; peaches, 25      quarts, plums, 30 quarts; berries, 24 quarts. That is a      good deal more of each fruit than any one person will eat      during the non-productive season. So to achieve your goal      you would only have to can a few quarts of each fruit as it      came in season. The same principle applies to vegetables.    </p>        <p>      As for canning equipment, by all means try to get a      pressure canner. It is recommended by all authorities as      the safest way to can your vegetables properly and it saves      time, fuel and work.    </p>    <p>      Still unknown to thousands of families the pressure canner      is also a miraculous cooker. It will cook a complete meal      in 10 to 15 minutes, including soup, roast and vegetables!      Using little water, it saves valuable vitamins and      minerals. It tenderizes cheaper cuts of meat. It can      preserve surplus meat, poultry or fish, although we believe      that the quick-frozen method is best.    </p>    <p>      As for pressure cooker size you will want an 18 quart      canner (holds 5 quart jars) or a 25 quart size (7 jars).      With the canner you will receive a booklet giving you a      time table for processing and general directions for      canning.    </p>    <p>      Even if you don't go in for all the "Have-More" Plan , we      believe in "canning all you can" anyway - and that goes for      peace time as well as during a war or a depression. Believe      me, it will give you a tremendous feeling of satisfaction      and security when you begin to line up the jars on your      shelves. Ed is just as proud as I am to point to the      canning shelf and say, "I canned those bread and butter      pickles." Such bragging is good for the soul - it's one of      those intangible satisfactions you get from homesteading.    </p>    <h3>Salt Some Away</h3>    <p>      Another easy way to keep certain vegetables is to salt them      down. The one big fault with this method is that it      destroys a lot of the vitamins and minerals. For this      reason we have not done any brining (except to make      sauerkraut, ham and salt pork).    </p>    <p>      Everybody knows about salting cabbage to make sauerkraut. I      put mine up in jars as I have found this even easier than      the crock method. It is also possible to salt away corn,      beans, cauliflower, turnips and peppers.    </p>    <p>      Alternate layers of washed vegetables and salt are packed      into earthen crocks and weighted down. If enough brine      to.cover vegetables completely is not formed, a      concentrated brine made with boiling water may be added.      Use 3 1/4 cups of salt (common or coarse salt is better      than fine tablesalt) to 6 quarts of water. Keep in a cool      place - the vegetables are ready to use at any time.    </p>    <p>      To desalt for use, put salted vegetables in a big pan,      cover with cold water, heat to luke warm, stir and pour off      water. Repeat until vegetables are only slightly salty.      Then you can cook in regular manner.    </p>      <h3> Dehydration</h3>    <p>      During the early part of the war I read a lot of articles      telling how wonderfully easy it was to dry your vegetables      and fruits at home. Well - in our attempt to carry out      miniature farming in the easiest, most modern way, we      borrowed one of the very best home model dehydrators which      set back one of our neighbors about $40.    </p>    <p>      We soon found that proper dehydration is not so terribly      simple after all. It takes as much preparatory work as      canning and it is more difficult than freezing foods. We      think its worst feature is the long drawn out drying      process. It takes 10 hours just to <em>dry</em> the food      thoroughly; you can scarcely complete the project in one      day.    </p>    <p>      In our section of the country where there is much moisture      in the air, dehydrated food should be packed in tightly      sealed jars so it won't absorb water again until you use      it. And when you do, dried food takes pre-soaking to return      it to its normal state.    </p>    <p>      We do not believe <em>home</em> dehydration will ever be      widely used in America except where it is specifically      desirable for reasons of taste, geography or space.      Frankly, we couldn't stand the taste of the three things we      tried - snap beans, spinach and broccoli. But if your      family is extremely fond of dried beans and peas then it      would be worthwhile to dry them. Also, we all know that      certain fruits are splendid dried.    </p>    <p>      If you are interested in drying foods, we suggest you try      it out in your cooking oven first and see if you like the      idea. You'll get about the same results you'd get with a      special machine. Place oven door open and set the      temperature at 165°. You'll have to get the length of      time for drying your specific vegetable or fruit from an      instruction booklet. Then freshen up the dried samples,      cook them and see if you like them. If you do approve, you      can either buy or build a dehydrator.    </p>    <p>      You can build a dehydrator using a small electric fan and a      bathroom heater but the thermostat is quite important. It      is probably just as well to buy the whole dehydrator or      else use your oven. Detailed building plans may be obtained      from your County Farm Agent.    </p>    <p>      We'd suggest you read a little booklet called "Dehydrating      Fruits and Vegtables," put out by General Electric Company,      Schenectady, N. Y. It costs 10 cents but it is well worth      reading <em>before</em> you decide to go in for      dehydration.    </p>   <h3> Suggested Reading:</h3>    <p>      <em>ABC of Home Freezing</em> , $1.00. <em>The Countryman's      Cookbook,</em> the ideal cook book for the country place.
