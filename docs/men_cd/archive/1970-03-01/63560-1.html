        This "breakaway" drawing shows the interior of our small barn. We found that this 16 x 30 foot barn efficiently houses 30 hens, 60 broilers, 20 or more rabbits, 4 goats or a cow and calf, 3 or 4 sheep, and a dozen squab. Barn cost $200 to $400 (1970 prices). Bill of materials, plus complete building plans including 10 large detail drawings of front, ends, interior layout, goat stalls and milking stand, cow stalls, chicken section, squab loft, also a turkey sunporch are available.
