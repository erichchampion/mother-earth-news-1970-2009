    <p>
                        <p>      Housekeeping should be a challenging subject to us American      women. Instead, many of us consider it with boredom, or      with resentment that we have to do it at all - and if our      husbands try to talk over our methods, we are likely to fly      off the handle and wind up with the old come-back, "Well,      I'd just like to see <em>you</em> take care of the house      for a while!" I'm afraid I have to admit to just such      arguments with Ed in the past, and to be honest, there is      something to be said on both sides.    </p>    <p>      I do believe that there have been several things      outstandingly wrong with modern housekeeping and that      homesteading can answer some of our problems. The more      important drawbacks I've found are:    </p>    <p>      (1) <em>Our own attitude toward housekeeping</em> is      probably the key. I'm afraid that many of us look down our      noses at it - we consider most any other job but homemaking      glamorous. What we forget is that every job, whether it's a      man's job or a career woman's job in office or factory, has      its own monotonous routines, too.    </p>    <p>      (2) <em>Lack of creative work in modern housekeeping.</em>      Women really can't be blamed for considering "housekeeping"      a routine borethat's about all that's left of homemaking in      the city or suburbs. I don't know how you classify your      jobs, but, outside of raising children, I consider cooking      about the only creative work left in most city and suburban      homes today. The current trend seems to be for more and      more of the family work, recreation and even child raising      to be handled outside the home. All that will be left is      vacuuming, washing dishes, and dusting - all negative and      unstimulating.    </p>    <p>      (3) <em>Lack of economic satisfaction.</em> Since today's      woman has been brought up to be independent, it's no wonder      she's not satisfied with the eternal routine left in the      home. She's not increasing her family's security unless      it's in the negative way of cutting down expenses. Since      the urban custom is to buy everything eaten, worn or used,      it's no wonder urban women have begun to feel their best      contribution to their families would be jobs outside the      home.    </p>    <p>      <em>(4) Lack of housekeeping efficiency.</em> Manufacturers      have done much to make housekeeping efficient and easy, but      keeping house still needs a thorough engineering job done      on it. The amount of your daily work is determined the      minute you choose your house, the type of furnishings you      put in it, the way you arrange your storage space and the      type of clothes you buy. If we women want to contribute      more to our families we will have to make routine work as      efficient as possible.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What Does A Homestead</strong> <strong>Do To      Housekeeping?</strong>    </p>    <p>      It makes a big difference in your housekeeping when you      have a homestead. When I lived in the city I had no      interest whatsoever in housework except for learning to      cook elegant meals. I became so bored with apartment      housekeeping I found a job in a large New York City      department store. And did I add anything to Ed's and my      security? I did not - for it took practically all my salary      to provide adequate clothes for my job, lunches, bus fares,      a part-time maid and other incidentals. Now that I am a      partner on a homestead, housekeeping is just the routine      part of a bigger job - not the be-all, end-all of my      existence.    </p>    <p>      Of course you have much more to do on a country place than      in the city. But these new jobs are stimulating, creative      and varied. Think of the satisfaction of having a freezer      stuffed with luscious food you helped raise yourself.      Imagine your canning shelves laden with full, glistening      jars - your handiwork.    </p>    <p>      And you can do all sorts of other things: separate milk to      get heavy cream, make scrapple, make cheese, extract honey      from the combs, (this is a 3-ring circus of fun!) and serve      dinners of "home-raised" products that guests really      appreciate!    </p>    <p>      There are also many pleasurable activities outdoors. The      pigeons, geese and ducks, and all the new born goats can be      your special projects. You'll help with the garden, have      herbs and all the beautiful flowers you want. Someone has      said, "He who lives with the land has innumerable      professions." He is, for example veterinarian, farmer,      gardener, animal husbandman, chemist, accountant, manager,      weatherman, machinist and so on. That is equally true for      the wife who shares homesteading activities.    </p>    <p>      Once you get started doing and making things for yourself      you'll probably want to do even more - do more sewing for      your housemake your own Christmas presents (we're raising      popcorn this year for little remembrances) maybe even make      some rugs or do weaving. You can also raise or make things      for sale. Life will become a question of how can you do all      that you want to do.    </p>    <p>      Because a homestead offers a woman an unlimited field of      creative activities, it removes the complaints against      housekeeping.    </p>    <p>      First, your own attitude is brighter and more interested.    </p>    <p>      Second, your work gives you pleasure and satisfaction      because it is creative.    </p>    <p>      Third, you have that fine independent feeling of holding      your security in your own. hands, and you'll take great      pleasure in knowing your children are being well-fed and      growing up in the most wholesome of surroundings.    </p>    <p>      Fourth, you are more of an executive and have more interest      in increasing your efficiency.    </p>    <p>      In the book "Zero Storage" Mr. Sparkes, the author,      describes the Fylers, a family of seven who have been      homesteading and he sums up the economic point with this      sentence. "For Mr. Fyler, one fact must be crystalclear: by      reason of the land and the freezer, instead of one Fyler,      seven are now helping to make the family living."    </p>    <p>      When Jackie gets a little older, there will be three      Robinsons instead of two "bringing home the bacon." Before      we started homesteading it was <em>just Father!</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Now For The Housekeeping Itself</strong>    </p>    <p>      It has taken me three years of "homesteading" to realize      how ridiculous it is to judge a woman's housekeeping      ability by whether or not her country house is spotless,      with dishes and beds attended to by 10 a. m. Instead of      ironing or dusting, you will want to pick strawberries that      are just ripe, wrap a chilled lamb for the freezer or go      fishing with your children. But your very annoyance with      the routine tasks will give you the incentive to cut down      the time they take. And when you tackle them with this sort      of outlook, they immediately become more interesting!    </p>    <p>      It seems to me, proficiency in housekeeping falls into      three main divisions:    </p>    <p>      (1) Layout and furnishing of your house.    </p>    <p>      (2) Equipment.    </p>    <p>      (3) Management and organization.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The House And What You</strong> <strong>Put In      It</strong>    </p>    <p>      Architects are now beginning to realize that a woman's      working areas should be laid out in an orderly, convenient      way. I have begun to see more plans recently where washing,      ironing, sewing, cooking and children's play areas are      correlated instead of being scattered all over the house      from attic to basement. Also on a homestead you will want      to consider whether the bathroom is handy to the outdoors,      whether there is plenty of space for outdoor clothes where      you usually enter and whether there is sufficient place for      country tools and equipment. The amount of your routine      work is somewhat determined the minute you choose a house.      If you should build a new house, there will be many new      designs and ideas to choose from. For instance, new radiant      heating (hot water pipes under the floor) not only provides      a healthier heating plan, but it will mean less work for      Mama - no dusting and no painting those unsightly dust      catchers called radiators. Also floors over the heating      pipes may well be tile - warmer in winter, cooler in      summer. And if the floors are pretty and warm - why, fewer      rugs to pay for or to clean.    </p>    <p>      If you already have a conventional house there are still      plenty of things you can do to make housekeeping easier. On      your floor you can use patterned or neutral colored rugs      which don't show dirt quickly, or scatter rugs which can be      picked up and washed. The floor itself is easier to clean      if it's waxed and a vacuum cleaner can often be used on it      to more advantage than a dust mop. Or if you have an old      unsightly floor, spatter painting might be the answer to      simple care. Wooden furniture collects less dust if it's      waxed instead of polished with oil.    </p>        <p>      When it comes to upholstered furniture most of us know how      much simpler it is to have slipcovers which can be removed      and washed easily. And if you buy or make slipcovers,      bedspreads and draperies out of material that doesn't have      to be ironed, (say seersucker, monkscloth - rubber or      aluminum cloth that can be washed with a hose) then you've      saved yourself even more work. These are just a few samples      of what you can do if you look at your work with a mental      question mark.    </p>  <h3>  Equipment</h3>    <p>      I remember a city husband saying, "I don't want my wife to      have any more gadgets to make her apartment keeping easier      - she'll just spend more money shopping!" I guess it's true      in the city that the more spare time you have the more      money you spend, There's not much else to do.    </p>        <p>      On a homestead, however, spare time is time to use      productively. Of course <em>you can</em> run into town but      you don't <em>want</em> to go when you've got a garden to      plant or the bees are getting ready to swarm or a new lamb      is expected.    </p>    <p>      So machinery for housekeeping and homesteading jobs is a      good investment, for you use this equipment to create more      for your family. One homestead husband told me he would      rather have an electric mixer with all its extra parts in      his home than an automobile (granting that a car wasn't a      vital necessity to his job).    </p>    <p>      Here are some specific ways to use equipment on a homestead      like ours:    </p>    <p>      a) <em>Cooking.</em> The freezer is one of the greatest      aids to cooking. While its primary function is to preserve      raw food, it is a boon to better cooking management. While      you're cooking stews, soups, beans, creamed foods, cakes,      cookies or breads, it is easy to make double or triple      batches and put part of them in the freezer for another      meal. You can assemble a variety of dinners from soup to      dessert, place each dinner in one bag or box and freeze it      for future quick delivery. Lunches too can be prepared for      the week and frozen each complete in a separate lunch box.      I should mention that "a grocery store in your home" also      saves a surprising amount of shopping time.    </p>    <p>      The electric mixer with all its parts is another wonderful      aid to better and speedier cooking. Besides whipping up      cakes, milk shakes, cream and meringues, the mixer can be      used to squeeze oranges, grind coffee, peel potatoes and      shell peas and beans.    </p>    <p>      The pressure cooker is a splendid contrivance. Ed      discovered ours at the N. Y. World's Fair and considered it      the most wonderful thing at the whole fair. The actual      cooking time for a stew is just 15 minutes!    </p>    <p>      b) <em>Dishwashing.</em> The electric dish washer not only      saves labor but also time because you store the dishes in      the washer and run the machine once a day. But if you don't      have a dishwasher, you can approach this chore somewhat as      if you did have the appliance. In other words, washing the      dishes after each meal is another one of those silly      standards we have set up for ourselves. If you rinse the      dishes, stack them, wash them once or twice a day, rinse      with boiling water and towel-dry only the silver, you will      save yourself almost as much time as the machine can save.    </p>    <p>      <em>c) House cleaning.</em> The vacuum cleaner can often be      used to good advantage on the floors themselves and for      more of the dusting jobs. However, cleaning can chiefly be      simplified by the furnishings you choose and your own good      management.    </p>        <p>      d) <em>Washing And Ironing Clothes.</em> Of course, we all      know that washing is being reduced to the minimum by      certain types of machines which wash, rinse, and even dry      for you. As for ironing if you hang flat things like sheets      and towels very smooth and straight, there's really no      reason for ironing them at all. I have heard any' number of      men and women say they loved to sleep between sheets fresh      from the country-scented breezes. Such clothing as      seersucker dresses and cotton knit shirts also need no      ironing (or the very slightest touch) if they are hung      carefully on the line. Those fabrics which insist on being      ironed (and how many we can do without!) should be taken      down while damp to save the sprinkling job. Notice how your      ironing depends on your washing routine and both depend      even more on how you shop. As one clever homesteader wife      in Ohio wrote, "I begin my ironing when I do my shopping"    </p>    <p>      All in all I've found that housekeeping in the country can      be run a little more like a business. Each housewife, as an      executive (when the Boss is away) will want to do her own      planning, adapting the schedule to the weather vane -      whether there are raspberries just ready to pick or whether      it's high time for a relaxing swim.    </p>    <p>      The women I've met who are interested in homesteading in      the modern way are smart - they know that they will have a      big job to do.    </p>    <p>      But they also know the rewards are tremendous.    </p>
