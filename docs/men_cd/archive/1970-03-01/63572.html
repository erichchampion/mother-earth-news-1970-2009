                    <p>      IF the Ed Robinsons of five years ago could have talked      with the Ed Robinsons of today about home orchards, the Ed      Robinsons of five years ago would have been saved a lot of      trouble. Now perhaps we can save <em>you</em> that trouble!    </p>    <p>      Soon after we first moved to our place we became excited      about dwarf fruit trees - pigmy trees that produce      delicious, normal size fruit in only 2 or 3 years. But when      we went to order some our local nurseryman didn't have the      right kind of dwarfs and he advised us to buy standard      trees instead.    </p>    <p>      "But we haven 't enough space in our back lot for many big      trees," we protested.    </p>    <p>      "Then why dont you plant your orchard in front of the      house?" he suggested.    </p>    <p>      "Well, we planned to landscape the front with pretty      trees."    </p>    <p>      "Haven't you ever seen an apple tree in blossom?" he asked.      Of course we had - so we planted our 18 fruit trees around      the house and front lawn. We landscaped with <em>fruit      trees instead of shade trees.</em> (Later we discovered      that the back of our acre was too swampy for fruit trees      anyway. If the roots of young trees stand in water they      don't do well.) So we've never regretted our decision to      plant fruit trees in front of the house.    </p>    <p>      We feel that the very first thing people should do when      they buy a piece of land - even before the house is built,      when possible - is plant a small orchard. The sooner      planted, the sooner you will get fruit. The length of time      you have to wait before your fruit trees bear seems to      discourage a lot of people. But even if you should move      before your fruit trees do bear, they'll increase the value      of your place many times beyond their cost.    </p>        <p>      As for the care of fruit trees, our nurseryman gave us a      lecture before he would take our order. He said, "Now      remember, you can't simply plant fruit trees and forget      about them. You have to spray them - just as you do garden      plants - and prune them once a year in addition." It wasn't      until after we assured him we would do this, that he would      take our order.    </p>    <p>      More likely than not your own local nurseryman will take a      real interest in your fruit growing project. It is a good      idea to buy from him rather than a far away nursery selling      by mail because not only will you get some good advice from      your local nurseryman from time to time, but he knows which      varieties do best in your particular locality. Many local      nurserymen today buy their young stock from famous      nurseries all over the country, so if you want something      special he'll get it for you.    </p>    <p>      We had a lot of fun considering what and how many trees to      plant. Before we decided which variety of apples, we      visited a commercial apple orchard, bought four or five      varieties, tasted them and cooked them.    </p>    <p>      We learned that commercial growers give the appearance of      an apple - or any fruit - undue importance. With them looks      seem to rate as high as taste. Probably because appearance      sells the apple at the fruit stand. Obviously, the first      thing we were interested in was taste . . next came keeping      qualities .. looks was last on our list.    </p>    <p>      In selecting the varieties we kept in mind the fact that      certain apples ripen in July, others in August, September      and October. By planting five apple trees, we would have      apples summer and fall - and also a late apple which would      keep over the winter.    </p>    <p>      After considerable reading and a lot of talks with our      local nurseryman, the following is a list of the standard      fruit trees we believe sufficient to furnish a large family      with enough produce for eating, canning and storage: 3      apple; 4 peach; 3 pear; 2 sour cherry; 1 sweet cherry; 2      plum. In Southern latitudes you can have citrus, apricot,      nectarines, fig. Be sure not to plant your young trees too      close to the house or to other trees. (See chart.)    </p>    <p>      The following table will give you an idea about yields and      age of bearing:    </p>        <p>      Even though all the fruit catalogues tell you that you can      plant in either spring or fall, spring is preferred in most      sections. Planting should be done as early as the ground      can be worked and before growth has started in the plants.      Don't use fertilizer when planting. Use fine earth and      tramp earth solidly about the roots with your feet, shovel      by shovel. Set trees about an inch deeper than they were in      the nursery.    </p>    <p>      Keep a three foot circle cultivated around the tree trunk.      In the fall mulch them with poultry house litter. From the      second year on, cultivate regularly and fertilize at end of      June by using a barnyard manure mulch. This serves to keep      in moisture during hot dry spells in July and August and      provides additional food. You will be surprised at how much      faster this will bring your trees to bearing.    </p>    <p>      Some state agriculture departments will send you postcards      throughout the year telling you with what and when to spray      your fruit trees. Needless to say, this is an invaluable      service and you should get your name on your state's list      of fruit growers so you can more easily take care of      spraying. Ask your County Agricultural Agent about this      service.    </p>    <h3>      Dwarf Fruit Trees    </h3>    <p>      Now, after many years of experimental work really good      dwarf fruit trees are available. The two exciting things      about dwarf fruit trees is that they take very little space      and they bear fruit a year or two after you plant them      whereas with standard trees you have to wait four to eight      years!    </p>    <p>      Take a look at the comparison chart on the next page. It      will help you decide which type of trees to plant.    </p>    <p>      Dwarf trees have many advantages, and a few disadvantages,      when a detailed comparison is made with standard trees.      Let's look at the advantages:    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees take less space.</em> In the space required      by 4 standard apple trees, 80 x 80 feet, you can plant as      many as 64 dwarf apple trees! Even the ordinary suburban      "house and lot" has space for a few dwarfs.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees are easier to spray or dust.</em> All fruit      trees must be sprayed or dusted. Dwarf trees, particularly      the "little" dwarf or "semi-dwarf" can be sprayed or dusted      with an efficient garden sprayer or duster. This is most      desirable because the expensive, bulky spraying equipment      for standard trees is not needed. Spraying is much easier,      and consequently it gets done.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees bear fruit sooner.</em> A "standard" apple      tree usually does not produce fruit for 5-10 years after it      has been planted. A dwarf tree will often bear fruit in two      years!    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees are easier to prune.</em> Obviously a tree      5 to 10 feet tall is much easier to prune than a tree 25 to      30 feet tall.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees grow large fruit.</em> Fruit buds, like      turnips for instance, need to be thinned if the biggest      fruit is to be grown. Dwarf trees, where the tiny fruit can      be thinned easily, often produce bigger fruit.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees make possible more variety.</em> Naturally      if you can plant 10 to 15 dwarfs in the space required by a      single standard tree, you can have 10 or more various kinds      or varieties of fruit, instead of one. This has another      advantage: you can have early, mid-season and late fruit by      selecting varieties that ripen at different times.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees are easier to harvest.</em> Fruit from the      smaller dwarfs may be picked from the ground without the      bother and danger of climbing a ladder.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees mean, less damaged fruit.</em> Fruit      dropping from the small dwarfs, particularly when the      ground under the trees is mulched with straw, hay or      sawdust, is often undamaged.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees produce top-quality fruit.</em> Fruit      produced on a dwarf tree not only tastes as good as fruit      from a standard tree, but because it is easier to give      dwarfs better care, the fruit often surpasses that from      large, and particularly old commercial trees.    </p>    <p>      As for the disadvantages, here are several you should know      about:    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees are more expensive.</em> Of course prices      vary in different localities, but a New York State      nurseryman lists 2 year dwarfs at $3.50 and his standard      trees at $1.75. When the supply catches up with the demand,      this difference won't be as great.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf trees are shorter lived.</em> However, this is      not too serious a drawback. A dwarf apple tree will bear      for 25 to 30 years compared to say 40 years for a standard      tree.    </p>    <p>      The fruit you get from dwarf trees is full-sized. All      standard varieties of fruit are available on dwarf trees;      that is you can buy dwarf McIntosh, Baldwin, Northern Spy      apples . . Bartlett, Clapp's Favorite, Duchess, Seckel      pears . . . Elberta, Hale-Haven peaches, and so on.    </p>    <p>      The fact that dwarf trees are easier to care for doesn't      mean you can grow them without knowing a few of their      peculiarities, however. Certain things about dwarf      management are different. They must be planted correctly or      they may grow into large trees. Pruning and thinning,      though more simplified, is different. You'll find it really      fascinating to read up on dwarf trees - also this will      insure you against buying the older kind of dwarfs which      nurseries used to carry and which weren't always reliable.      We recommend you seriously consider planting dwarf apple,      pear and possibly sweet cherry trees as these three have      been developed the most successfully. Dwarf fruit trees,      one of the biggest horticultural advances in years, mean a      lot for the small place.    </p>        <h3>      $ 50 From a Single Nut Tree!    </h3>    <p>      Dear Ed & Carolyn: One day Carolyn and I received this      letter:    </p>    <p>      "Here in Georgia a great many pecans are raised      commercially and many farmers have a side line grove of the      nuts which add considerably to their income. The trees make      beautiful ornaments as shade trees besides the crop they      bear. One suburban home I know of has two trees that      brought in a total of $84 cash this year. Another single      tree I know of bore over $50 worth of nuts."    </p>    <p>      Sgt. Herbert P. Keene    </p>        <p>      This was only one of the letters friends have written us to      say that we should include mention of nut trees in our      "Have-More" Plan. They pointed out that nut trees are      unbelievably easy-to-grow, make beautiful shade trees,      require less spraying and pruning than fruit trees, and      supply the table with a nutritious, easy-to-keep food.    </p>    <p>      Well, I will say truthfully that about all that I know      about nut trees is what I've read about them. We do have on      our place one big, old butternut tree that has born huge      crops; the nuts have a heavy husk and thick shell, but are      mild and good-tasting after you get them cracked.    </p>    <p>      But Carroll D. Bush, in the <em>Nut Grower's Handbook</em>      points out that here in America in the past thirty years,      more has been accomplished with nut trees than millions of      people in the old world accomplished in centuries. Better      varieties of both European-Asiatic, and American nuts have      been selected and bred for improvement and hardiness.    </p>    <p>      Today there are nut trees suitable for growing in every      state. Of course, nearly everyone is familiar with the      great almond and English walnut groves on the Pacific Coast      and the pecans in the south. But do you realize the many      varieties that have proven successful in the north and      eastern states? Here are some of them: Imgreat almond and      English walnut pecan, hickory, hican (a cross between a      hickory and pecan), filbert, almond, Chinese and Japanese      chestnuts, heartnut, and many varieties of hazel nuts.    </p>    <p>      Although nut growing is by no stretch of the imagination a      "get rich quick idea," it does have a definite commercial      side. For the homesteader, nut trees do have a good deal to      offer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Suggested Reading:</strong><br /> <em>Dwarf Fruit      Trees-$1.00.</em>    </p>
