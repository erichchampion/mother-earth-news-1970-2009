                    <p>      ONE of the first projects I wanted when we moved to our      place in the country was rabbits. I had read many times      that they produced excellent tasting meat at little cost.      Carolyn, however, was sort of skeptical of the project      because she thought that she she might not be able to eat      the rabbits - they looked so cute.    </p>    <p>      One pay-day when I happened to read an advertisement      offering a six compartment, all-metal wire hutch for sale      for less than $20 I couldn't resist this good buy. The      hutch eventually came, but Carolyn was still skeptical and,      anyway, we were up to our necks getting our barn finished      up, learning to milk, .running our broiler battery, our      bees, goats, and setting the geese. It wasn't hard to put      off getting the rabbits for a while.    </p>    <p>      Then, a friend of mine, Wally Boren noticed I hadn't done      anything with my rabbit hutch and he asked if he couldn't      use it until I got ready. That was all right with me. He      borrowed the hutch, set it up in his garage and began      reading up on the subject of rabbits.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Choosing a Breed</strong>    </p>    <p>      Wally picked a variety called the Chinchilla. You can take      your pick of several good <em>meat</em> breeds. Wally      favored the <em>medium</em> sized breeds - weighing around      8 to 10 pounds grown. You could go in for the Flemish      Giants, for instance, that sometimes weigh 20 pounds. They      eat a lot more, of course, and their fryers, at 7 to 9      weeks, weigh not too much more than do those of the medium      breeds at the same age. The New Zealand Whites are another      popular medium weight breed - their white fur is worth more      than the Chinchilla ...and there are are a number of other      good medium weight breeds.    </p>        <p>      Of course, there are Angoras (with their beautiful, white,      long fur) and other "fancy" breeds. But these are not meat      rabbits. In ordinary times many of the small rabbit raisers      don't bother to save the skins, but they do have some      value. Right now, for example, buyers are offering from 30       cents a pound to 90  cents apiece. You can obtain names of      buyers from one of the rabbit magazines.    </p>    <p>      Wally started with a "trio" - a young buck nine months old      and two does of the same age. He bred the does shortly      after he got them. The following month he had 17 bunnies.      Seven is a big enough litter, according to the experts, for      one doe to raise. So Wally destroyed four from one litter      of 12 and gave the other doe an extra to bring her litter      of 6 up to 7. Wally rubbed a little Mentholatum on her nose      so she couldn't smell the difference between her own and      the young one from the other litter.    </p>    <p>      At seven weeks all 14 of the young rabbits were alive and      frisky. At this age they weighed 44 pounds. The two does      were bred again.    </p>        <p>      <strong>8c to 14c A Pound</strong>    </p>    <p>      Wally kept some careful records. Here's what he learned      from them. A Chinchilla weighing 3 pounds, live weight will      cost you from 25c to 35c or a little more to raise. You'd      pay a dollar, at least, in the market for him.    </p>    <p>      Wally figured out how much <em>time</em> it took him to      raise one 3 pound fryer. It took <em>one hour flat</em> .      That is, he explained, "I spent 14 hours actual chore time      - as a dub beginner - raising 14 meat-meals for the family.      I could cut that in half, but I like puttering around      them."    </p>    <p>      Wally had such good luck with the rabbits that, of course,      I wanted to see what I could do. Wally, who is a most      generous-minded fellow, kept us supplied with rabbit - he      kept saying that after all he had to pay "rent" in some      form or other for the hutch. Carolyn and I both liked      rabbit very much; it tastes something like chicken but has      a "firmness" that chicken doesn't have. I guess it was a      year before I got my hutch back and got to keeping rabbits      myself.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, after we did get the rabbits we didn't mind      the idea of raising them to eat - I guess after eating some      rabbits raised by somebody else it's easier to go into      rabbit raising strictly from the standpoint of raising them      for meat and not let yourself make pets of them. Of course,      when you can put rabbits or chicken or anything else in a      freezer and leave them there for a few weeks or months      you'll find that you think of them as "meat" - not "cute      animals."    </p>    <p>      <strong>What To Feed Rabbits</strong>    </p>    <p>      You'll see in the diagram on Page 43 a hayrack indicated      for each hutch. This you keep full of hay - the rabbit      experts, because the industry is located in California      where Alfalfa is easily obtainable, recommend Alfalfa. But      a good, leafy clover hay is all right. Timothy isn't as      high in protein as clover, but if it's properly cured it's      better than a poorly cured clover or Alfalfa. The rabbits      can manage the hay better if it is cut up in 3 or 4 inch      lengths. (Take a handful, squeeze it into a bundle and saw      it off into a box with an ordinary hand saw.) You can also      feed vetch, cow peas, and other rich hays. You can give      your rabbits dried scraps of bread and crusts; also any      kind of vegetable parings and tops they'll eat. You can      feed them lawn trimmings and weeds. But don't leave what      they fail to eat in the pen. Take it out next day and      pretty soon you'll find what they like best and how much to      feed. Rabbits relish carrots and other root vegetables.      Feed green feeds sparingly, at first if your rabbits aren't      used to them. Sometimes they over-eat and bloat or get      diarrhea.    </p>    <p>      You also feed them one of the prepared rabbit pellet foods      or whole grain - they don't seem to like any grain that's      ground up too fine. You can ask the man you buy your      rabbits from for directions as to what he's found the best      methods of feeding.    </p>    <p>      <strong>How Fast Do Rabbits Multiply?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Everybody has a story about how fast rabbits multiply. I      remember a friend of mine who had a small family and      worried about this when getting his rabbits. In fact, he      decided that he'd start with the minimum a single doe and a      single buck. He was a salesman and everytime I'd see him      I'd ask, "Well, how many rabbits have you now." The first      month it was just two. The second month it was two. The      third month it was still two. About this time my friend      began to worry about his rabbits <em>not</em> multiplying.      And when, at the end of the fourth month, he still had only      two, I began to get a little suspicious. Sure enough, he      didn't have a doe and a buck - he had two bucks!    </p>    <p>      Determining the sex of a rabbit is easy. Get the man you      buy your rabbits from to show you.    </p>    <p>      I find that two does and a buck produce 40 or 50 rabbits a      year to eat. At three pounds or more that is all our family      needs.    </p>    <p>      You breed about every 90 days. Gestation only takes 30 to      32 days. The young nurse for five or six weeks, learning to      eat as they go along. At six or seven weeks you put the      young fryers in another hutch or two and eat them between      then and ten or twelve weeks. Or you process the whole      tender crop at 8 or 9 weeks and quick-freeze all except the      one you want for dinner then.    </p>    <p>      You can eat them as fryers until they're seven or eight      months old-full grown. But by that time they've eaten a      great deal of fairly high priced food and therefore aren't      so much of a bargain, cost-wise. Better separate the young      bucks from the does at 3 months.    </p>    <p>      You can kill off old rabbits at the end of a couple or even      three years and make a stew out of them. The skin from a      mature rabbit is worth considerably more than from      "fryers."    </p>    <p>      You can "inbreed" with no harm. Just keep a young doe or      two out of a litter and breed her to your same buck when      she's about 7 to 9 months' old. You can stagger your      breeding times, having one fresh litter coming in every 6      weeks from one doe or the other. But if you adopt this      system, you can't exchange the young between the does.      Every 3 or 4 years buy or trade for a new buck.    </p>    <p>      And while we're on the subject of buying, try to get good,      healthy and strong animals. You don't care about a "show"      rabbit but do get good blood. They may even cost you from      $10 to $25 a trio; you aren't likely to save money by      starting out with $3 worth of scrubs. However, don't worry      about <em>pedigree</em> or perfect markings or blue ribbon      winners.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Building the Hutch</strong>    </p>    <p>      Rabbits are very hardy animals, easy to raise and extremely      clean. They can stand a lot of <em>cold</em> weather. They      can't stand very much of a <em>wetting</em> and <em>hot      weather</em> gets 'em down. They wear fur coats in      <em>summer</em> remember. They have to have clean feed      trays and clean water. They need a cool, shady summer place      with lots of ventilation, <em>some</em> sunshine      occasionally and a good roof. We keep our metal hutch in      the barn. We clean it out once a week, keep plenty of straw      on the floor and in the nest box (a nail keg with a strip      across it - see illustration) and, in winter we water the      rabbits night and morning, taking the water out before it      freezes. In summer we keep the water trays always full.      They drink a lot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hasenpfeffer</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here is a recipe for the famous German way of preparing      rabbit. Cut up your rabbit meat and put it into a jar.      Cover with vinegar or wine and water, equal parts. Add one      sliced onion, salt, peppers, few cloves, bay leaves.    </p>    <p>      Let this soak in a cool place for two days. Then remove and      wipe the meat dry and brown it <em>thoroughly</em> in a      frying pan, in hot butter, turning it often. Gradually add      the sauce or juice you pickled it in, and let simmer about      half an hour, until tender. Before serving stir in one      cupful of thick sour cream.    </p>    <p>      There's a lot more you ought to know about raising rabbits      before you go ahead. But I've tried to give you an idea of      what's involved. There are one or two good books on rabbits      that you'll find worth while reading. You ought to have      more detailed information about hutch building, about      dressing a rabbit, about keeping records, etc. "See Country      Bookstore Catalog."    </p>        <p>      All in all the impression I'd like to leave is that rabbits      are one of the first projects any one interested in home      food production should investigate.    </p>    <p>      The space required by my rabbits is only 3 x 10 feet - and      rabbits can be started any time of year.    </p>    <p>      Easterners are behind the times in discovering how      delicious rabbit tastes. In California, where rabbit is      king, many prefer it to chicken which it resembles.    </p>    <p>      No other meat is easier, quicker, as inexpensive for the      homesteader to produce as rabbit . . . and it's easier to      dress than chicken.    </p>    <p>      Two good does and a buck will give a family easily 180      pounds of good-tasting meat per year.    </p>    <p>      A modern, self-cleaning hutch fitted with the new automatic      watering, requires less than 5 minutes attention a day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Suggested Reading:</strong><br /> <em>Rabbits For Food      and Fur,</em> $3.00.    </p>
