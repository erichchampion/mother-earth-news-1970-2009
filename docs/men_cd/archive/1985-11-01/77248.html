                    <h2 id="subtitle">Milk Money from Goats</h2>    <p>      MOTHER feels strongly that youths can be creative "doers,"      working toward more ecological and self-reliant lifestyles      . . . whether their tasks be raising chickens on a farm or      maintaining rooftop container gardens in the city. To      support the endeavors of our often overlooked "underage"      citizens, we're glad to publish well-written articles from      younger children and teenagers concerning projects they've      undertaken. However, we recommend that all young authors      query (that is, send us a letter telling about the story      they'd like to do) before writing a full article. Address      inquiries to Mother's Children, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, 105      Stoney Mountain Rd., Hendersonville, NC 28791.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Britt Barker</h5>      <p>      When my family moved to the country eight years ago, the      very first animal we purchased was a grade (or mixed-breed)      goat to provide us with some milk. We've come a good way      since then. Now we have a purebred French Alpine buck, and      fourteen does that give us plenty of milk for our family      and some extra to sell. Taking care of the goats is my      responsibility. Selling their surplus milk to our friends      and neighbors helps the animals pay their way and earns me      some extra money.</p>      <h3>PICKING A BREED</h3>        <p>      If you want to raise goats, the first thing you'll have to      do is to pick a breed. You'll probably have to experiment      some until you find the one that is best suited to your      climate and needs. After our original grade doe had come      and gone, we purchased two purebred, registered Nubian does      for $100 each. They were very beautiful and gave rich,      creamy milk. Then a friend sold us our French Alpine buck,      and we got two grade Alpine does. We soon found that      Alpines give more milk than Nubians. Today most of our herd      is Saanen-Alpine mixed and provides plenty of good-quality      milk.    </p>    <h3>      RAISING THE GOATS    </h3>    <p>      I drylot-feed my goats, since I don't have enough good      pasture to provide all the grass they need for good      production. I feed them a highprotein dairy goat grain      formula (I found the recipe in Jerry Belanger's Raising      Milk Goats the Modern Way), which I have mixed up at our      local grain mill. I also feed them a mixed alfalfa hay. I      give each doe one pound of dry matter (usually about evenly      balanced between grain and hay) for each pound of milk      she's producing.    </p>    <h3>      BREEDING    </h3>    <p>      The doe will usually come into heat after the first fall      frost, though I've had some does be as late as December. If      you keep a buck near the does, they will probably come into      heat sooner. But be sure that he's in a stall with high      sides-most bucks are good jumpers! (We've had bucks in      stalls that we thought were tall enough . . . and ended up      with some unplanned breedings!)<br />      <br />      The doe will stay in heat for about three days. It's best      to breed her on the first day, because then you're more      likely to get doe kids. If she's not bred during these      three days, you'll have to wait another three weeks for her      next heat.<br />      <br />      I recently tried an experiment on one of our does: I bred      her once or twice every single day she was in heat. The      result was quadrupletsthree does and one buck! I'm going to      repeat that procedure on half my herd, the does randomly      selected, over the next four years to try and find out if      more breeding consistently yields more kids.</p>      <h3>KIDDING</h3>      <p>      About 145 to 155 days after the doe's been bred, she'll kid      (give birth). I think kidding is the most exciting part of      goat raising. I start checking my does frequently and      carefully about 140 days after they're bred. If one is      getting ready to kid, she'll become quite nervous and      appear "hollow" in the flank and on either side of the      tail. She may also discharge a thin mucus several days      before kidding. When a more gelatinous and yellow discharge      appears, she's really ready to give birth.<br />      <br />      In a normal birth, the kid's forelegs appear first with the      nose between them. But sometimes there are problems. If one      leg is turned back, I usually disinfect my hand with      iodine, reach inside the doe, and try to pull the leg back      into the normal position. Sometimes my sister has to use      her small hands to do this job! Once one of our does had a      breech (bottom first) birth. This kid died after a few days      (it appeared to have a broken back).<br />      <br />      Other times a kid is too large to come out. In that case, I      usually call our local veterinarian for help. A LaMancha      doe we owned had this problem two years in a row. The first      time, when the doe had twins, the vet had to hook a small      chain around one kid's lower jaw and really pull hard. That      broke the doe's tail and the kid's jaw. The second kid was      also damaged by its difficult birth and died about a week      later.<br />      <br />      The second year, the LaMancha had just one big buck kid. He      died inside the doe, so the vet cut off the kid's head to      get him out. This horrified our five city visitors who were      observing, but apparently it's standard veterinary      procedure.<br />      <br />      Most times, of course, the kid is born perfectly healthy.      The dam (mother) licks it clean, and it's up and ready to      nurse within an hour of its birth! I don't let it nurse,      though, but feed it the dam's colostrum (first milk) from a      bottle. I do this because we want the doe's milk. Also, we      want to control how much milk the kid gets, and we don't      want the kid to get too attached to its mother. I have      tried leaving the kid with the dam for about three days,      but by that time they have bonded emotionally, so it's very      hard to separate them.<br />      <br />      One year we left two kids with their dam as an experiment.      Now every other year we had taken this doe's kids away      immediately. So when we left these two kids with her, she      didn't know what to do! But we were so busy with other      activities that we forgot to keep a good check on how they      were doing.<br />      <br />      Three days later, we found the kids nearly dead in the      stall and the dam's udder extremely full of milk: She      didn't know how to nurse them, so they were starving. They      died soon afterward. We learned our lesson from that      experience and now always keep a good eye on our animals.      (We later learned that there is a way to revive starving      kids: Put them up to their noses in warm water, stick a      stomach tube down their throats, and feed them warm milk      through that.)<br />      <br />      I've made other mistakes. One year I lost five valuable doe      kids from enterotoxemia (a major goat disease). Since then,      I have been sure to vaccinate all of my does and kids, to      see that the kids have fresh, clean water, and to keep      their feeding dishes absolutely sterilized. I've also had a      few kids die of pneumonia, caused by a damp stall or cold      drafts in the barn.</p>      <h3>MILKING</h3>      <p>      It is very important to have a regular milking time. The      does count on this! I've found that if I don't milk at      regular intervals, the goats produce less milk. The best      thing to do is to milk your goats morning and evening,      about twelve hours apart.<br />      <br />      We use a stanchion (a milking stand). It's simply a      platform with a ramp, feeding box, and head restraint. (We      got the design from the Rodale book Build It Better      Yourself.) The doe jumps up to feed, and we lock her head      in place. We used to just tie goats up. They moved around      so much that milking was a backbreaking job.<br />      <br />      Before milking, you should wash the udder with warm water      and soap and-when necessary-clip away any excess hair. This      helps keep the milk clean. After the doe has been milked,      dip the tip of each nipple in an iodine disinfectant. This      helps prevent mastitis, a bacterial disease which can ruin      a good milk goat forever. One of my best milkers got      mastitis and never regained her former level of production.      We sold her-now she acts as a "guard dog" for a flock of      sheep!<br />      <br />      After you're done, bring the milk inside right away and      pour it through a milk strainer. Otherwise, it may get a      nasty "goaty" taste. Although goat's milk can be drunk raw      (I find it much tastier this way), most people pasteurize      it first to kill any potentially harmful bacteria. To do      this, just heat the milk up to 165°F, then quickly cool      it down by putting the pan in cold water. Always keep fresh      goat's milk stored in a refrigerator.</p>      <h3>SELLING THE MILK</h3>      <p>      The legal requirements for marketing goat's milk vary from      state to state. If you're planning to sell large quantities      of milk, you'll certainly want to consult your local health      department. Many goat owners make unlicensed sales of milk      to neighbors. Such "bootlegging" is widespread. I do it,      and so does everyone else I know around here who sells      milk. (Kids who have lemonade stands in the suburbs are      also running "bootleg" operations!)<br />      <br />      If you sell your goats' milk, you must make sure it's clean      and pure. I sterilize my milk pail, strainer, and jars with      a bleach-and-water solution. I make sure my goats are clean      and have clean quarters. And I check every doe regularly      for any signs of illness (I always isolate an ill goat and      discard its milk). And I pasteurize the milk I sell when      the buyer requests it. [EDITOR'S NOTE: The FDA is currently      considering outlawing all sales of raw milk because of      possible health hazards.]<br />      <br />      The first thing to do when you are planning to sell milk is      to develop a milk route. You can find customers by running      an ad in the local newspaper, by putting a Goat Milk For      Sale sign beside the road, or by using word of mouth (which      is what I do). Tell people that goat's milk is not just for      sickly people or children who are allergic to cow's milk.      Instead, it is more digestible than cow's milk (and      somewhat more nutritious), naturally homogenized, and      delicious! And milk from your homegrown goats won't contain      any processing additives or pollutants.<br />      <br />      I usually sell the milk for $1.00 a quart ($1.25      delivered); many health food stores sell goat's milk for as      much as $3.00 a quart. It costs me approximately $150 to      drylot-feed one goat for a year and about $50 to cover      miscellaneous expenses such as veterinary bills. A good doe      will give about 200 gallons (800 quarts) of milk a year. So      if I sell half of that milk at $1.00 a quart, I'll gross      $400, and, after subtracting expenses, have a net profit of      $200. And that's not even counting the 100 gallons of milk      my family gets to drink for free!<br />      <br />      It takes me about an hour a day to care for my herd of 15      goats. Caring for one doe would take hardly any time at      allmaybe 20 minutes a day, once you had her housing and all      established.<br />      <br />      If you decide to raise goats, you, too, will find that it's      a fun and challenging project, and a way to make a little      money, to boot.</p><p>Good luck!    </p>
