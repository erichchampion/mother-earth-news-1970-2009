                    <h5 id="byline">      by Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>    <h3>      WOOD ASHES IN THE GARDEN    </h3>        <p>      It has long been thought that wood ashes are a good source      of potassium for plant nutrition, but recent research has      shown that you should use a great deal of <em>caution</em>      in adding them to your garden.    </p>    <p>      Charles Frase, of Tennessee Technological University,      analyzed ashes from seven tree species for potassium,      phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and sodium; he also      estimated the extent to which the ashes could raise soil      pH. His results show that ashes of various tree species can      differ widely in their mineral content.    </p>    <p>      For example, shagbark hickory <em>(Carya ovata)</em> and      white oak <em>(Quercus alba)</em> ashes have much less      potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) than does hemlock (      <em>Tsuga canadensis</em> <em>),</em> while ashes of white      ash <em>(Fraxinus americana)</em> and silver maple      <em>(Acer saccharinum)</em> have intermediate levels of K      and P. On the other hand, the shagbark hickory and white      oak ashes have the same liming potential-pound for      pound-as high-quality ground limestone!    </p>    <p>      Frase's data indicate that the manner in which wood ashes      are used in gardens should be based on <em>the kinds of      ashes available and on the pH of the soil.</em> Although      detailed information about the mineral composition of most      tree species is not available, some tentative      generalizations can be made.    </p>    <p>      It appears that slow-growing, dense hardwoods yield ashes      that are best used as liming materials. Based on Frase's      research, such ashes can be expected to contain about 2% K,      0.3% P, and 30% calcium (Ca). Their soil-neutralizing value      relative to pure calcite (NV/CaC0 3 ) should approximate      100%.    </p>    <p>      Fast-growing, low-density hardwoods yield ashes that are      typically balanced in their levels of calcium relative to      their levels of potassium and phosphorus: They contain      about 4% K, 1% P, and 20-25% Ca, and have a liming      equivalent of 85% NV/CaC0 3 . These ashes can thus be used      as liming <em>or</em> fertilizing materials for soils with      low or near-neutral pH.    </p>    <p>      Softwoods are likely to yield ashes with low levels of      calcium and high levels of potassium and phosphorus: about      510% K, 1-2% P, 17% Ca, and 60-70% NV/CaC0 3 . These ashes      are best used as fertilizing materials only and present      little risk of raising soil pH excessively.    </p>    <p>      Two other considerations: Gardeners in arid regions should      watch out for the so dium level of wood ashes, to avoid      contributing to soil salinity. Sodium content ranges from      about 0.3% in slow-growing hardwood ashes to about 1.5% in      softwood ashes. In addition, research at the University of      Rhode Island has shown that large applications of wood      ashes can result in high concentrations of the toxic heavy      metal cadmium in certain garden crops. Wood ashes contain      lead, copper, and zinc as well as cadmium, but      <em>none</em> of these heavy metals appear to be taken up      by plants if the soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.0.    </p>    <p>      Thus, the most important consideration in applying wood      ashes to garden soil is to <em>avoid putting on too      much.</em> (The Rhode Island researchers recommend no more      than 20 pounds of wood ashes per 1,000 square feet of      garden area annually.) Large applications can lead to soil      alkalinity and plant accumulation of heavy metals. The key      to safe use is annual monitoring of soil pH-keep it between      6.0 and 7.0!    </p>    <p>      <strong>RESEARCH BRIEFS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Thwart Christmas tree thieves with "ugly mix." Sad but      true, each holiday season brings out the Christmas tree      "rustlers"-and any landscaped area that includes      evergreens is at risk. In fact, Cornell Plantations in      Ithaca, New York, had trees worth up to $3,000 each cut      down and carted away by midnight entrepreneurs . . . until      an employee invented a way to make evergreens so ugly      (temporarily, of course) that nobody would <em>want</em> to      steal them! To make your own batch of "ugly mix," stir      together 20 ounces of hydrated lime (from a building supply      store) and 4 ounces of Wilt-Pruf anti-transpirant      (available at garden stores) in a nonmetallic bowl. Slowly      fold and stir that into two gallons of room-temperature      water in an aluminum pan. Mix in two bottles of      <em>pink</em> food coloring . . . and spray the dye onto      your trees with a garden sprayer. Do this during dry      weather; rain gradually washes the coating away.    </p>    <p>      Fumes from fresh-cut wood can harm houseplants! Growers of      houseplants belonging to the family Gesneriaceae, including      the "true" gloxinia <em>(Sinningia</em> species),      <em>Gloxinia perennis,</em> and <em>Drymonia</em> species,      report yellowed leaves and defoliation within a week of      stacking freshly cut oak firewood in the same room with the      plants. To be safe, watch for symptoms on <em>any</em>      plants close to your firewood.    </p>    <p>      Deer problems? Use soap! If you live in an area with      abundant deer (as we do!), your orchard is probably a      favorite winter browsing spot. A good fence is a sure,      <em>expensive</em> cure for the problem, but we've found a      cheaper remedy. Hang pieces of deodorant soap (plain soap      doesn't work-the deer actually eat some kinds!) in      the trees. We use one piece for small trees, and four or      more pieces for large ones. The result? Over the past two      years, we've had <em>no</em> deer browsing on      soap-protected trees.    </p>    <p>      Green up stored cabbages. A Canadian agricultural      researcher exposed stored cabbage to light for a week at      50Â°F. Afterward, the heads looked greener, and vitamin      C in the outer leaves was increased nearly tenfold!<br />      <br />      <strong>GLEANINGS</strong>    </p>    <p>      A new private firm, the National Houseplant Diagnostic      Laboratory, will attempt to determine houseplant ailments      by mail.
