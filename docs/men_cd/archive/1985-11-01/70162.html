                    <h5 id="byline">      by bob Kornegay    </h5>    <p>      Lush ornamentals, indoor herbs, year-round vegetables, and      colorful hanging baskets can all be yours . . .      naturally.<br />      <br />      It's quite a treat to pick a fresh sprig of rosemary or      thyme in the middle of February . . . that little piece of      summer fills the air with garden freshness. Just as      enjoyable is the lush beauty of a hanging basket that's      overflowing with ornamental plants (or vegetables!).<br />      <br />      You <em>can</em> create such indoor plantings successfully      <em>and</em> organically, but let me be honest: The task is      not as easy as container gardening with <em>chemical</em>      amendments. After all, an organic soil is not simply a      mixture of wholesome ingredients but a medium filled with      biological activity . . . and that activity is hard to      maintain in a small, enclosed container. To do so, you'll      have to apply both extra attention and some special      know-how. I've been perfecting my indoor organic growing      techniques for the past five years-three of those at      MOTHER's Eco-Village-so I've learned a lot of the      secrets of indoor organics the hard way: through      experience. I'll be glad to share them with you here,      especially as they pertain to two of my favorite indoor      plantings-kitchen herbs and hanging ornamental      baskets.    </p>    <h3>      SOIL MIXES</h3>      <p>      Organic soil contains complex living nutrient chains that      are in a constant state of renewal. Warm, moist gases from      decomposition foster fungi and bacteria. Organic surface      litter and subsoil minerals feed earthworms, which leave      their humus-rich castings for plant roots. Everything is      connected. To maintain a container organically, then, you      have to feed the <em>soil</em> in order to feed the      plant.<br />      <br />      Consequently, organic container growing demands      <em>involvement-</em> you can't just stick an herb,      vegetable, or ornamental in a pot and forget it. The      easiest and best long-term plan is to annually reconnect a      contained plant with natural soil by growing it outdoors      during the warm months. (I do this with almost all of my      perennial herbs.) Another general rule is that large      containers work a lot better than small ones: They provide      more room for roots and soil organisms to intermingle. Of      course, some plants-such as jade, dieffenbachia, and      most flowers-do better when potbound. These will need      to be repotted often to keep their soil fresh (unless      they're particularly slow-growing).<br />      <br />      The actual soil you use will have to be mixed carefully.      The single most important quality you're after is <em>good      structure:</em> The constant watering a pot or basket      requires would soon break down ordinary garden soil. I      start of by layering stones or pieces of broken clay in the      bottom of any container to provide drainage. (I use      clay-not plasticpots.) Then I add a layer of worm      castings or quality compost made entirely from vegetative      matter (no manure). If the pot will hold heavy      feeders-such as tomatoes or blue flowers-I then      put in a layer of ground-up egg-shells to provide extra      calcium.<br />      <br />      Next comes' a soil mix that's very similar to the seedling      flat mix we use when starting plants for MOTHER's gardens.      I combine five parts oak leaf mold . . . four parts good      topsoil . . . two parts compost . . . two parts coarse,      sharp sand . . . one to two parts worm castings . . . and a      pinch of Earthrite C allpurpose organic fertilizer.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Earthrite C is available from Zook      & Ranck, Rt. 1, Gap, PA 17527.]</em> If I'm going to      keep the plant contained for a long time, I'll add two      parts oak bark chips to this mix to provide structure and a      long-term nutrient supply.<br />      <br />      This mix is mostly carbonaceous and very stable. Its loose      texture opens a lot of surface area to soil microorganisms.      You can also add one part perlite, vermiculite, or milled      sphag num moss if you like. These help lighten the soil and      have a remarkable ability to absorb and retain both water      and air. They have no nutrient value, however.<br />      <br />      Be sure that you mix your container soil ingredients on a      clean surface-I wipe my counter first with a 10%      chlorine bleach solution. You can keep any extra mix clean      for later use by storing it in an airtight plastic      bag.<br />      <br />      Does all this soil mixing sound like a lot of work? Well,      it's my belief that organic container growing      <em>demands</em> a quality soil. However, sometimes I do      make things simpler for myself by buying a high-quality      potting mix from a nursery and adding compost (and/or worm      castings), sea kelp, bonemeal, and Earthrite C. Such      commercial mixes are mostly mineral and organic in origin,      but they're generally sterile, as well. That's why I add      some extra supplements to supply and help nourish soil      fauna. I use this "nursery-based" mix mainly on ornamentals      that will never be put directly into the garden, because      good commercial potting soil can maintain its structure      almost indefinitely.<br />      <br />      If you're going to be keeping any plant in a container for      more than a couple of months, you must provide it with some      occasional supplemental feeding. Spraying the foliage about      every ten days with a weak solution of seaweed is a very      efficient way to feed it. Calcium nitrate can also be      sprayed on-again in a well-diluted solution-to      provide a direct nitrogen boost.<br />      <br />      A whole bunch of homemade concoctions derived from fish,      manure, herbs, or compost can be applied to the soil. But      most of these- especially manure teas-should      <em>not</em> be sprayed on the leaves: They will increase      the likelihood of plant disease. Applied as liquid      supplements to the soil, they'll feed the organisms that,      in turn, feed the plant.    </p>    <h3>      CULINARY HERBS    </h3>    <p>      Probably the most useful plants for organic container      growing are the culinary herbs. At MOM's self-reliant      permaculture homestead, we've installed a large growing      box, next to our kitchen's south-facing window, that's used      for raising herbs. <em>Wherever you</em> grow them, though,      you'll find them to be versatile and valuable.<br />      <br />      Of course, the biggest benefit of maintaining an indoor      herb garden is that it allows you to harvest fresh      flavorings 12 months a year (not to mention being able to      enjoy the plants' fragrance and the sight of them framing a      frosty scene outside your window!). It'll also let you      bring in those tender perennial herbs that would otherwise      be lost to the first killing frost. In this way, you're not      limited by your planting zone. In our zone-seven home we're      able to "winter over" such delicate plants as sweet      marjoram, rosemary, coriander, and several varieties of      scented geraniums.<br />      <br />      Some of the tender perennials-such as the pineapple,      emerald, and indigo sages-generally get too large in      just one season to move to containers. I take fall cuttings      from such plants and raise <em>those</em> indoors.<br />      <br />      I also grow some annuals that I start from direct seed in      August or early September. These include sweet basil,      cumin, some pepper grass or salad cress, small-leaved      garland, and a nutty-tasting green called roquette.<br />      <br />      To complete the collection, each fall I usually dig up one      of each of the hardy culinaries just so I can have them      fresh in the middle of winter. These include chives,      oregano, common sage, a few varieties of thyme, apple and      blue balsam mints, parsley, and shallots (for their tops).    </p>    <h3>      HANGING BASKETS    </h3>    <p>      I'm also fond of indoor ornamentals. But as all of you who      have become addicted to growing these decorative species      probably know, they do tend to accumulate.<br />      <br />      While I sometimes trade some of my extras for different      plants, I've found another use for surplus ornamentals: I      arrange.them in large, multispecies hanging baskets that      are quite dramatic. These picturesque islands, suspended at      eye level or slightly below, really show off beautiful      foliage and flowers. Spilling greenery in all directions,      they catch your eye and pull you right into the center of      miniature worlds. And if you use a dwarf semicascading or      leaning juniper (or other suitable miniature evergreen) as      a centerpiece, the whole assemblage takes on that bonsai      quality of scalelessness. A few well-selected stones and      driftwood pieces added to the basket complete the      picture.<br />      <br />      You can also make beautiful hanging baskets with herbs.      Rosemaries, thymes, and parsleys are especially suited to      ten-inch hanging containers. You can create a very      woodsyfeeling assembly by having a two- or three-year-old      creeping rosemary cascading over one side of a basket      filled with the lacy bluegreen foliage of thyme, sage, and      dwarf catnip.<br />      <br />      You can even make a surprisingly attractive hanging basket      with vegetables! A Small Fry tomato, planted in the center      of a 24-inch basket, can be supported by a cord or rope      hanger and surrounded by celery, spinach, bok choy, leaf      lettuce, and French marigolds. Any plants you don't have      room for on top can be set into the basket's sphagnum moss      sides. (Leaf-not head-lettuce and flowers work      best here.)<br />      <br />      No matter what type of plants you're raising, though, don't      use any <em>invasive</em> types. An orange mint, a Boston      fern, an airplane plant, or a spider plant will soon take      over a basket filled with less "pushy" species.<br />      <br />      To make a hanging container garden, you'll first need to      acquire a wire plant basket (available from most nurseries;      I've used sizes from eight to thirty-six inches in      diameter) and a bag of unmilled sphagnum moss. (You'll need      a surprisingly large amount of the moss-a small,      12-inch basket alone uses about 450 cubic inches.) Make      sure you get a solid hanging support-a hook with a      molly bolt in Sheetrock just won't hold up a heavy      container. Likewise, see that your cord or wire is secure.      If you make a macrame hanger, use an inorganic      material-not jute, which will rot. Maybe I sound      overcautious here, but, believe me, being awakened in the      middle of the night by the thud of a fallen 24-inch basket      <em>is not</em> a pleasant experience!<br />      <br />      Start by soaking the moss in a container of water. Then,      <em>while</em> it's soaking, bend down the horizontal wire      sections just <em>below</em> the rim, all the way around      the basket. Then grab a handful of moss, squeeze the excess      water out, fold it in half, and insert it      snugly-mossy side out-into one of those      just-under-the-rim sections of the basket. Continue until      this section is filled with sphagnum protruding equally      into and out of the basket. Then pull the bent wire back up      into place to secure the moss. Follow this procedure,      working around the basket, until you've completed a      sphagnum ring. That will help hold your soil mix in and      keep the rest of the moss you'll add from settling.<br />      <br />      Next, start at the bottom of the basket and line it with      unfolded, hand-size moss patties. Generously overlap these      pieces as you go-so your soil mix won't fall      out-and make sure you get up under the ring on top.      The lining should be about 1 inch to 1-1/2 inches thick all      over. Then pull off any loose pieces from around the      outside to "clean up" the appearance of the basket. (If      you're fortunate enough to have access to Spanish moss, you      can use that tropical material instead of sphagnum and let      it drape down from the basket for a dramatic effect.)<br />      <br />      Now cover the bottom of the basket with the moist soil mix      I described earlier, and gather your ornamentals. (You may      well want to arrange some on a table, while they're still      in their containers, to help you plan the composition of      the basket.) You'll begin by installing the plants that      poke out the sides of the container. Work a hole in the      moss just above a horizontal wire. Fill the basket with      soil to that level, then gently maneuver a side plant's      root ball into the hole so that the top of its root is at      the inside edge of the moss. Fill soil around that root      ball and go on to the next horizontal plant.<br />      <br />      Good choices for this application are ivies and other      trailing plants. Set an odd number of these-probably      three or five-around the sides of a foliar basket. On      the other hand, if you're making a flower-laden basket of,      say, pansies or petunias, you can plant them at every      section to give your basket a thick burst of color.<br />      <br />      Once you've filled the sides, you can put in your top      plants. Start by setting tall ones in the center (or just      off-center). Work different shapes of foliage around the      basket and finally, near the rim, add a few that will      cascade down. (Just watch that you don't let a hanging      plant cover an ornamental in the side.)<br />      <br />      One pattern I'm fond of for the center of a basket involves      using a large split-leaf philodendron to provide shade and      then hiding a delicate prayer plant or African violet in      that shadow . . . sort of inviting people to look inside.      (If you do use such delicate flowers as the African violet,      leave them in their own containers, burying them, container      and all, in the basket, and remember not to omit those      small containers when feeding and watering the      basket.)<br />      <br />      A few of my other favorite basket ornamentals are table,      button, maidenhair, and bird'snest ferns . . . bronze,      grape, and Swedish ivies . . . mother-in-law's tongue . . .      wandering Jew . . . rex begonia . . . fuchsia . . . some of      the slow-growing small and midsize bromeliads . . . and      schefllera (or umbrella plant).<br />      <br />      That's it. All you have to do now is clean up . . . trim      any blemished leaves from your plants . . . thoroughly      water the soil . . . and set the basket out of direct sun      for a day or so to "heal in."    </p>    <h3>      NATURAL HANGERS    </h3>    <p>      A particularly eye-catching variation of the hanging basket      theme is the natural hanger. To make one, simply use a      piece of driftwood, twisted tree branch, or half rotted      stump section for your hanger instead of a basket. Look for      a hollowed-out wood piece with some short limbs or branches      for support handles. If you use a rotted stump, knock off      all the pithy, soft material and let the whole thing dry      thoroughly. If you've got a piece of ocean driftwood, soak      it in water for a couple of days to wash out the salt. And      if any piece has a deep, water-holding pocket in it, line      that potential rot spot with a piece of plastic garbage bag      to protect it.<br />      <br />      To create a basket, attach a length of one-inch chicken      wire across the front of the wood with nails or staples.      Leave a little extra wire on top. Now, starting at the      bottom, line the chicken wire with soaked sphagnum. Then      add soil and side plants as you did before-making      sure the soil is packed in well so it'll hold the moss in      place. Plant the top, cover the soil mix there with moss,      and fold over the extra chicken wire to hold that moss in      place. If there are any blank areas in-your planting,      you can make an opening and insert a small plant or cutting      of, perhaps, sedum or wandering Jew.    </p>    <h3>      CARE AND MAINTENANCE    </h3>    <p>      Of course, taking care of those baskets, herbs, and other      indoor plants is the real test of the indoor gardener. Here      are a few helpful hints.    </p>    <p>      Light:    </p>    <p>      Providing the amount of light appropriate to your plants is      essential-too much is just as harmful as too little.      So when you're grouping greenery in a basket, try to      combine types that have the same lighting needs. Most      tropicals need partial shade, which is best supplied by the      filtered, direct sunlight you get beneath a slatted porch      roof, below a shade cloth, or-during warm      weather-under a light shade tree. Most vegetables,      flowers, and herbs want full sun-or only about 10 to      15% shade. If the light is uneven, rotate your plants or      baskets every week or so.    </p>    <p>      <em>Water:</em> There's no set schedule for watering plants      . . . they transpire much more water on a sunny day than on      a cloudy one. Temperature, wind, and humidity also affect a      plant's needs. The only way to <em>know</em> when to water      is to stick your finger down into the soil-it should      be moist, but not wet, to the touch. You may be surprised      by what you discover. Mature plants, for instance, can have      quite a thirst. I had a 16-inch Swedish-ivy basket that      took up to two gallons a day in August! Still, be careful:      Overwatering is the <em>single biggest killer</em> of      container plants, primarily because it's so hard to detect.      You can spot an underwatered plant; its leaves start to      lose color and droop. An overwatered specimen, though, may      look just fine until it suddenly keels over dead from root      rot.<br />      <br />      Water in late morning or late afternoon (but early enough      so the water can evaporate from the leaves before evening).      If possible, water from the bottom-set your pots in      saucers and fill those saucers with water. The capillary      action of the mix will draw up the liquid and nutrients.      This technique will reduce soil compaction and help prevent      the mix from drawing away from the wall of the pot. You can      even take a hanging basket down once in a while and set it      in a tub of water for a few minutes.<br />      <br />      In general, glossy, leathery leaves enjoy being sprayed      often, but water only the soil of fuzzy-leaved plants.      <em>Never</em> use cold tap water in the winter. And if you      must use city water, let it sit for at least a day first,      so the chlorine can evaporate.<br />      <br />      <em>Fertilizing:</em> I've already given some fertilizing      advice. In addition to that, consider working fresh      compost, worm castings, or other general organic amendments      into the surface soil of any container that you've kept for      more than a few months. On the other hand, cut back liquid      feedings during the slow-growth winter months . . . and      never give liquid tea to a severely dried-out basket, or      you may overdose it. Also, don't feed liquid fertilizers to      any plant until about three weeks after transplanting      (unless you want to administer a weak solution of chamomile      tea or vitamin B, right after transplanting to help it heal      in).<br />      <br />      <em>General Care:</em> The plant combinations in a hanging      basket will change over time. Usually, you end up with two      or three hardy perennials and periodically add annuals,      such as flowers. Just keep cutting off lanky growth and      unattractive or spent blooms . . . remove any leaves that      have blemishes . . . and replace any plants that are      dying.<br />      <br />      If your plants are healthy, they'll continue to grow. And      if your ornamentals start making babies, you can take that      as a sign that you're doing something right ... namely,      mastering the art of organic container growing!    </p>
