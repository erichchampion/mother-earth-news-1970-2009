                <hr />    <p>      Cold cash really does grow on trees-but you have to be      willing to go out on a limb for it.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Melinda Allan    </h5>        <p>      Last December, I earned $525 in just 12 days selling      mistletoe here in Eugene, Oregon. And since this popular      holiday symbol grows wild in many parts of the country and      can usually be gathered for free, chances are you can do at      least as well marketing mistletoe in your own community.      Furthermore, now is the perfect time of year to lay the      groundwork for your holiday business.<br />      <br />      Of course, first you'll need to make sure there's enough      mistletoe in your area. Drive around and look for the      distinctive ball-like clusters of green or yellow-green      foliage nestled among the bare branches of deciduous trees.      Mistletoe (genus Phoradendron) is a semiparasite that      prefers to freeload on oaks but also appears on such other      hardwoods as sycamores, black gums, maples, walnuts, and      elms. Botanists classify mistletoe as a semi parasite      because, although it thrusts its roots into the host tree      for water, it manufactures and uses its own chlorophyll.    </p>        <p>      Besides simply locating mistletoe, you'll need to consider      its accessibility-the plant, you'll soon discover, has an      annoying affinity for heights. Although you may have the      extraordinary luck to find it growing in easytoclimb scrub      oaks, the greater likelihood is that most clusters will be      perched amidst the topmost branches of tall trees. So make      a special note of any locations that offer particularly      easy picking. And, of course, be sure to get permission to      harvest any mistletoe that's on private property. (This is      seldom a problem. In fact, because the parasite can, if      present in large quantities, actually kill the tree it      lives on, some landowners will <em>pay</em> to have the      stuff removed!)    </p>    <h3>      HARVESTING    </h3>    <p>      Now comes the hard work. Wear appropriate clothes and shoes      for climbing trees, and bring along a few trash bags or      card board boxes for collecting your bounty.<br />      <br />      The traditional southern method for harvesting mistletoe is      to blast it out of the tree with a shotgun. I don't      recommend this approach; not only are shotgun shells      expensive, but the shot itself can damage both the tree and      the plant. Mistletoe is fragile, and you'll sell more if      the boughs you gather are intact.<br />      <br />      The best tool I've found for collecting mistletoe is a long      pole with a hook mounted on one end. Store-bought pruning      poles work nicely, but you can make your own: Get several      strips of 1"-wide lumber-wood that's light enough to      handle, yet sturdy enough not to flop over when hoisted      high. Drill a hole an inch or two in from one end of each      of the strips, and then join the sections with 1/4" bolts      and nuts. Assembled, the pole should be about 12 to 20 feet      long-anything longer will be awkward to maneuver. You can      make the hook, which of course is used to dislodge the      mistletoe, by simply driving a long nail into one end of      the pole and then bending the spike over. (The curved blade      from a linoleum knife will work, too.) To transport the      pole, just loosen the nuts and fold it down, like a      carpenter's ruler.    </p>        <p>      For really tall trees, you'll need a long ladder. And if      you intend to do much harvesting, you may want to get      yourself a partner. One person can climb the tree and the      other can steady the ladder, hand the pole up, and catch      the clumps of mistletoe as they fall. (Again, remember that      the plants crush easily. Place them carefully in your bags      or boxes, and don't stack the containers on top of one      another.)<br />      <br />      As you work, try to be selective about the plants you      harvest. Mistletoe grows in both male and female      forms-the latter plants are the most desirable,      because they bear attractive, whitepink berries. (These      usually ripen sometime in December.) From the ground, it's      often hard to tell the difference between male and female      plants, or even between leafy, attractive clumps and those      that are mostly stems. Leafy mistletoe with berries is      better, not only because it's more appealing visually and      therefore easier to sell, but also because it will fill      more bags-netting more money for your efforts. If      your mistletoe comes up short of berries, you can mix male      and female plants together in one spray or package. Some      people actually prefer to buy unberried clusters, because      the tiny white fruit will eventually fall off and make a      mess, and because the fruit is, after all,      <em>poisonous</em> (something for parents and pet owners      especially to consider). Still, I've found that most people      want those berries, regardless of the drawbacks.</p>      <h3>PACKAGING & PRICING</h3>      <p>      Mistletoe, like any plant, will begin to dry once it's      picked. Commercial dealers spray their wares with a      preservative to keep them freshlooking, but I think a far      better way is to harvest only as much as you can sell      within a few days, and then gather more when you need it.      If you keep the foliage moist (but not wet) and package it      properly, it'll retain its festive appearance nicely.<br />      <br />      I've found that plastic sandwich bags-the kind with      built-in zippers-make effective packages for      mistletoe (people want to see what they're buying!). Since      the containers create an airtight seal, though, it's      important to punch air holes in them, or water vapor will      be trapped inside and the sprigs will become moldy. To      prepare many bags quickly, just drive a few nails into a      board and then impale the sacks on the spikes. Instant      ventilation!<br />      <br />      As you package your product, keep your customers in      mind-try to make each parcel as attractive as possible.      Break the clumps you've gathered into small branches,      setting aside any particularly nice-looking sprays. Then      fill the bags, making sure to include one good spray and      several thinner sprigs in each one. Occasionally, I'm able      to buy colorful stick-on bows for just a few pennies      apiece-the decorations, either attached to the      outside of the bags or stuffed inside, really boost sales.      Don't crowd the mistletoe, though-and don't even      bother with such embellishments unless you can buy them at      a bargain rate that won't cut into your profits.<br />      <br />      Naturally, it's hard to say how much mistletoe you should      package for your first day of selling, but I'd recommend at      least a couple of hundred bags. Your sales will depend      largely on your location and your price. Here in      economically depressed Eugene, I ask only 50 cents a bag,      and can easily move 100 bags on a good day. Yet the same      bag in New York City would probably move well at $2.00 or      more. If your sales are slow, cut your price.<br />      <br />      Since mistletoe is an impulse item (people don't think of      buying it until they see someone selling it), the best      locations are wherever there's plenty of foot traffic. My      downtown mall "store" cost only $10 for a partial month's      rent. The booth itself doesn't have to be elaborate (I just      set up a card table and threw a tablecloth over it), but      you do need to make sure you and your product are visible.      My posterboard banners proclaim Mistletoe 50 cents . . .      Fresh, Organic, Oregon-Grown! . . . and Do Your Lips a      Favor! (Since the booth was outdoors, I bundled up in      appropriate cold-weather gear-and discovered      that looking somewhat chilled helped generate sales and      tips!)</p>      <h3>THE SKY'S THE LIMIT!</h3>      <p>      Actually, there are any number of other ways to market      mistletoe. If there's a college campus near you, try      peddling it door-to-door to fraternities and sororities. Or      if selling outdoors doesn't appeal to you, take your      packaged mistletoe to retail stores and offer it to them on      consignment. Also, florists and grocers will sometimes buy      bulk mistletoe at wholesale-but I've found that the      profit's better when I sell direct. (Besides, I get to meet      more people that way.)<br />      <br />      Whichever methods you choose, and however big or small your      business may be, I think you'll find-as I      have-that marketing mistletoe offers a multitude of      rewards. Not only do you make extra money for the holidays,      but you also get to make the season a bit merrier for other      folks. And you get to hang plenty of mistletoe around your      own house, so that you, too, can observe one of humankind's      more enjoyable traditions!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For more tips on gathering and selling this      holiday plant, see "The Mistletoe Game" in MOTHER N0. 30.
