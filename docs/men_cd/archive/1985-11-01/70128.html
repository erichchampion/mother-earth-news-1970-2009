                      <h5 id="byline">      by Mary Appelhof    </h5><hr />    <p>      From the Alaskan goldfields comes the hearty main course      for a perfect Christmas morning breakfast.    </p>        <p>      Sourdough bread is thought to have originated about six      thousand years ago, when some early baker discovered that      wild yeast spores, floating in the air and landing in a      flour and water mixture, caused fermentation that made the      dough rise. Throughout history, conserving a small amount      of starter (flour, water, and live yeast) for making raised      baked goods was common practice, and it's known that      Columbus carried a sourdough pot on his voyages to the New      World. California gold rushers were dubbed sourdoughs      because of their attachment to their pots, but it was the      prospectors in the Alaskan Klondike who were truly      dedicated to the fermented mix. Wild yeast is dormant in      cold weather, and without their precious pots, the miners      would have had only hardtack to supplement their meat and      fish diets throughout the long Yukon winters. Since      sourdough was the basis for breads, biscuits, cakes,      flapjacks, and other goodies, the prospectors guarded their      starter pots with the same protectiveness as they did any      gold they might find.<br />      <br />      The key to successful sourdough cookery is to acquire and      maintain a healthy starter sponge-the living, growing      yeast culture. You can purchase sourdough starter from      mail-order supply houses, but the fastest, most satisfying,      and most economical way to obtain it is to grow your      own.<br />      <br />      To make sourdough starter from scratch, place two cups of      tepid water in a plastic, glass, or earthenware bowl (metal      causes a chemical reaction that can kill the yeast), mix in      one yeast cake or a package of active dry yeast, then blend      in two cups of unsifted all purpose flour. Cover the bowl      with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and allow the blend to      ferment overnight in a warm place, 85° to 95°F,      stirring at least once with a nonmetallic spoon. The next      morning the culture will be frothy from the carbon dioxide      produced by the yeast, and the flour and water you added      will have been consumed.<br />      <br />      The starter will now be ready to bake with, but to store it      for future use, refrigerate it in a covered nonmetallic      container. Stir it occasionally (once a day isn't too      often), and if you won't be using it for a long while, feed      it once a week or so by removing and discarding about half      the sponge, then stirring in a cup of flour and a cup of      warm water. Let the starter ripen overnight as you did in      the beginning, and with each "replenishing," the starter      will grow a little healthier and a little sweeter.<br />      <br />      If you should happen to leave your refrigerated sponge      unattended for a long period of time-say, several      months-it's likely to turn into a sour-smelling,      slimy goop with a brownish syrup floating on top. No      problem: To make up a fresh batch, simply pour off any      unsavory parts, measure the creamy slurry that remains, and      mix in equal amounts of flour and water (for example, a cup      of starter would take one cup of flour and one cup of      water). Even if you have as little as a tablespoon of      usable starter, you can add a tablespoon each of flour and      water, let that stand overnight, and gradually build up to      the quantity required.<br />      <br />      The rule of thumb when using a portion of the starter in a      recipe is to replace that portion with equal amounts of      both flour and water. Therefore, the night before you want      to prepare a sourdough pancake breakfast, use the following      procedure. Remove the starter from the refrigerator and      measure the amount needed into a nonmetallic bowl. The      recipe below calls for one cup of starter, so to this      amount add one cup each of flour and tepid water. To      replace the cup of starter, add another cup each of flour      and water to the original container. Cover the containers      loosely, and let both sponges ferment overnight in a warm      place. The next morning, return the original starter to the      refrigerator; the second batch of sponge will now equal      about two cups and will be ready to be made into light,      delicious pancakes.<br />      <br />      The recipe that follows makes about 20 medium-sized      flapjacks.</p>      <h3>SOURDOUGH PANCAKES</h3>      <p>      2 cups of sourdough sponge (prepared the night before from      1 cup of starter, 1 cup of flour, and 1 cup of tepid water      as described above)<br />      2 eggs<br />      1 tablespoon of sugar (or 1 tablespoon of honey)<br />      1/2 teaspoon of salt<br />      1 teaspoon of baking soda<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons of tepid water.<br />      <br />      Separate the eggs, placing the yolks in one bowl and the      whites in another. Beat the whites until they're fluffy,      then fold in the sugar or honey. Beat the yolks lightly and      add the salt. Now stir the sourdough sponge into the egg      yolks, then gently fold in the beaten egg whites. Finally,      mix the baking soda with the water and blend this into the      batter by hand.<br />      <br />      Drop the batter by large spoonfuls onto a well-greased,      preheated (medium-hot) griddle-or use a seasoned      cast-iron frying pan. Cook the pancakes until they are      golden brown on both sides, flipping them only once, when      the tops are full of bubbles.</p>      <h3>PERSONALIZING THE BASIC RECIPE</h3>      <p>      These sourdough pancakes are so light and luscious that      they disappear in a hurry. To serve additional people, I      usually add an extra egg per person and increase the other      ingredients accordingly. If the batter is too thick, I add      a bit more water or milk. And if a test cake tastes strong      or sour, I just sweeten the batter by adding a pinch more      baking soda.<br />      <br />      You might also want to try serving blueberry sourdough      pancakes. Simply make the basic recipe, and right before      cooking, gently fold about a cup of fresh or frozen      blueberries into the batter.<br />      <br />      As you can see, for all the mystery that surrounds it,      cooking with sourdough is really a piece of (pan) cake. And      once you get the foregoing recipe fine-tuned to your      family's tastes, I'm sure you'll agree that the      <em>real</em> treasure to come out of the Alaskan gold rush      wasn't the yellow metal the hardy (and hungry) miners dug      from the earth, but rather, the delicious, durable pancake      and baking mix they popularized.    </p><hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE:    </p>    <p>      For a wealth of sourdough lore (including methods for      brewing starter by trapping wild yeast), as well as recipes      for sourdough bread, biscuits, cakes, muffins, and      variations on the pancake recipe described above, see the      articles "Sourdough!" and "More Sourdough!" in MOTHER N0.      11, and "Foraging for Wild Yeast" in MOTHER NO. 65.
