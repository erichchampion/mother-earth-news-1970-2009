    <p>
                        <p>      Whether you already own property or are simply in the      market for it, the alternative-energy potential of a      particular piece of turf ought to be as much a part of your      thoughts as are access, flooding, septic-field percolation,      the soil's bearing capacity, and the view. Good solar or      wind potential can return thousands of dollars per year in      energy savings-or even in income from power sold to      your area utility-and can offer your family security      in a future of uncertain energy availability.    </p>    <p>      In the simplest sense, an energy site assessment is just a      matter of figuring out how much, when, and where. As you'll      see over the next few pages, the first part of the question      is a straightforward matter of measurement, whether you      perform it yourself or consult tables prepared by someone      else. Determining at any given instant the amount of power      available isn't difficult, when compared to figuring "when"      and "where."    </p>    <p>      Predicting performance at some point in the future ("when")      is much more difficult because solar energy-and wind      is essentially a solar-driven phenomenon-is by its      nature variable.    </p>    <p>      Likewise, "where" can introduce large uncertainties into      the estimation of energy potential, particularly with the      more ephemeral sources, solar and wind.    </p>    <p>      Thus a useful alternative-energy site assessment should be      composed about equally of' careful measurement and an      understanding of the limitations on accuracy. Do your best,      but don't overestimate the reliability of your best. And      when you use the numbers, err on the side that will keep      your lights lit and your house warm (or cool).    </p>    <h3>      SOLAR    </h3>    <p>      In a solar site survey, "how much" is insolation (including      that which shines directly, that which is reflected, and      that which is scattered by the atmosphere-called diffuse);      "where" is local cloud cover and site shading; and "when"      consists of seasonal and annual variations in both how much      and where. Enthusiasm for solar over the last 15 years has      produced a great deal of information about this resource .      . . and those data can prove valuable to you.    </p>    <p>      More than is the case with wind, the way that solar energy      arrives has much to do with the success of attempts to      develop it. As you do a solar site assessment, then, keep      in mind that you're looking for more than just whether it's      worthwhile to develop your site or how much energy might be      available. The nature of the resource will suggest the best      hardware. For example, different sorts of collection      systems are best for capturing direct or diffuse radiation,      for coping with extensive shading from trees or buildings,      and for making do in areas with a high degree of      uncertainty in cloudiness, degree-days, and expected      sunshine. It's beyond the scope of this minimanual to tell      you how to design a system from the data you acquire, but      we will try to suggest some of the directions in which the      information might lead you.    </p>    <h3>      CONSULTING THE DATA BASES    </h3>        <p>      For a residential solar site survey, there's no real need      to actually measure the amount of sunlight available in a      particular locale. Radiation available on a horizontal      surface is listed for 248 locations in the Insolation Data      Manual (see the "Access" sidebar), and these data are      reprinted in numerous solar energy references, such as The      Passive Solar Energy Book (hereafter referred to as TPSEB).      Because the numbers include the sum of direct and diffuse      radiation, corrected for time of year and atmospheric      blocking and scattering, they can be used directly for      predicting the performance of a solar collection system. A      sample listing for Indianapolis, Indiana, is provided in      Fig. 1.    </p>    <p>      You may be disappointed to see that there's much less solar      energy available in Indianapolis in December than in June      (about 78% less, in fact). Sad but true. First of all, the      sun is much lower in the sky in Decemberabout 27°      altitude (its angle above the horizon) versus 74° at      solar noon (0° azimuth) on June 21-so its rays are      spread farther across a horizontal surface, reducing the      concentration. What's more, the December sunlight is      scattered by its less direct (and therefore longer) passage      through the atmosphere.    </p>    <p>      Note, however, that these insolation figures are on a      horizontal surface. In December, vertical or angled      surfaces will be much closer to perpendicular to the      incoming rays, and the concentration per square foot will      be higher than that recorded in the charts. (We'll get back      to this in a few paragraphs.) Likewise, ground that slopes      down to the south will receive a higher concentration than      that which is flat or sloping north. Though you can adjust      to a north-sloping lot with properly angled windows or      absorbers, a south-sloping one is still preferable, as      shadows from trees, hills, and other objects will be      shorter.    </p>        <p>      Another important factor enters into December's      comparatively low insolation value in Indianapolis. The      Global KT Cloudiness Index, as listed in Fig. 1, is the      fraction of the solar energy available above the atmosphere      that's reaching the ground: 0.335 for Indianapolis in      December. Though the total radiation figure includes the      effect of cloudiness, this number tells us more: that 66.5%      of the radiation arriving from the sun at the outer edge of      our atmosphere is being intercepted in the air by clouds,      haze, etc., before it hits the ground.    </p>    <p>      When you compare this figure to those of other months and      other locations, it's obvious that it's pretty cloudy in      Indianapolis in December. And because of the clouds, much      of the solar energy that arrives will be diffuse, rather      than direct. This can affect collector orientation (since      diffuse radiation can, in effect, be considered to come      straight down) and collector choice (since high-temperature      absorbers make little use of diffuse radiation).    </p>    <p>      The National Climatic Data Center's Comparative Climatic      Data for the United States offers more clues about average      weather conditions in Indianapolis: Fig. 2 tells us that      39% of the days are sunny in December, while June has 66%      possible sunshinefurther confirming that clouds obstruct      much of the solar energy in Indianapolis in December.    </p>    <p>      Thumbing on through Comparative Climatic Data, you'll find      that, on the average, December in Indianapolis offers 5      clear days, 6 partly cloudy days, and 20 cloudy ones. These      numbers offer clues to the size of storage needed for a      solar collector to get through cloudy spells in      Indianapolis. (Unfortunately, these data don't tell us      whether it's clear for 1 day, partly cloudy for 1 day,      cloudy for 4 days, and so on through 5 cycles . . . or      clear for 5 days, partly cloudy for 6, and then overcast      for 20 consecutive gloomy, chilly days. Collector and      storage sizing would be very different for these extreme      examples.)    </p>        <p>      Another section in Comparative Climatic Data gives us      snowfall averages-potentially useful figures because the      reflectivity (or albedo) of snow can dramatically increase      the amount of radiation striking a collector. Snow often      increases ground reflectance by a factor of four. A      vertical collector can capture a great deal of radiation      bouncing off the snow, but one that's angled upward, toward      the sun, will reflect (rather than absorb) most of this      indirect radiation.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, Comparative Climatic Data doesn't tell us      the actual number of days that the ground is likely to be      snow-covered. But by taking the 4.9-inch snowfall figure      for December and fudging against other tables that give the      mean number of days with a minimum temperature of less than      32°F (25), the normal daily maximum temperature      (39.2°F), the normal daily minimum temperature      (23.7°F), and the normal daily mean temperature      (31.5°F), we can see that there's a fair likelihood      that the month's total gain would be increased by      reflectance off snow.    </p>    <p>      On sunny days with snow cover, gain would be enhanced by      about 40%; there would be a minor increase on cloudy days.      (See TPSEB, professional edition, for more exact figures.)      From a design standpoint, the presence or absence of snow      cover adds variability to the "when" part of an assessment.      Unless you live in an area where you can depend on snow      cover, this factor makes it more difficult to pick the      right size collection and storage system.    </p>    <h3>      EXTRAPOLATING TO YOUR SITE    </h3>    <p>      If you happened to be considering buying a piece of      property a mile or so west of the Indianapolis Airport,      where the measurements in the figures were made, the      government data would be dandy to use in making      alternativeenergy judgments. The area is fairly flat, so      you'd be unlikely to be caught in a pocket where fog, haze,      or smog would obscure the sun much more than at the      airport. Likewise, you wouldn't be near a body of water      that might encourage morning fogs.    </p>        <p>      If, however, you look for land over near Terre Haute, 70      miles away, cautious extrapolation becomes important.      Indianapolis is still the closest measuring station, but it      would be worth looking at the data for Evansville, Indiana,      and Springfield, Illinois, to see if there are big      differences. A large variation (say, more than 10% in total      radiation) for the three sites should make you cautious      about assuming that Terre Haute's climate is the same as      that of Indianapolis. (It's possible, even likely, that the      Indianapolis Airport has significant periods of smog or      haze.)    </p>    <p>      Next, you need to look at the regional and local features      of the Terre Haute property. There's very little altitude      difference between the two areas, so there aren't likely to      be big differences in insolation based on reduced      atmospheric density. (Likewise, the altitude shouldn't make      it colder.) What about the site's topography? Is it in a      valley that might trap fog, smoke from woodstoves, etc.? Is      there a significant stream nearby to add moisture to the      January chill? At the very least, frequent morning fogs      might lead you to orient your collector a little west of      south to face the more abundant afternoon sun. Here you'll      have to depend on observation, estimation, and      instinct-bearing in mind that most insolation and weather      data stations are at airports, where the terrain is usually      flat and unobstructed.    </p>    <h3>      SHADING    </h3>		       <p>      The heart of the ;York You'll do on your feet when      performing a site assessment is to determine the patern of      shadows cast by anything that might get between the sun and      your collector. Owner surveys and performance monitoring      tell us that the most frequently encountered problem with      solar energy systems is shading. The importance of clear      access to the sun's rays can't be overestimated. Even the      popular notion that deciduous trees are OK for winter      performance and beneficial for summer shading-because they      shed their leaves-is seriously flawed: The average bare      hardwood knocks out 40% of the incoming rays, and the      leafless branches of some species may intercept 45% or more      (see Fig. 3). Transmission levels are lowest, of course se,      when the trunk of a large tree is in the way. but even the      smaller peripheral branches can block from 20% to 40% of      the sunlight.    </p>    <p>      Even a preliminary solar site survey should include a rough      determination of the shading patterns on a piece of      property, and shading should be thoroughly diagramed before      you build anything. Here again, though, the sort of solar      collection scheme you're planning will determine the      information you need.    </p>    <p>      Water-heating systems must have unrestricted access to the      sun 12 months of the year . . . while a passive heating      system would, ideally, be unobstructed in the coldest      months, partially shaded in the spring and fall to limit      gain, and fully shaded in the summer to prevent      overheating. Likewise, though you'd be interested only in      the southern exposure for a photovoltaic panel, you'd want      to look at potential summertime shading on the east and      west walls of a planned house. In the summer, a great deal      of the cooling load can come from. gain through east and      west windows that intercept the rays of the low morning and      (in particular) afternoon sun (see Fig. 4).    </p>    <p>      What you must do is draw a profile of the landscape against      the horizon from exactly where you plan to locate the      collector, and compare this diagram to sun-angle chartssuch      as those available in TPSEB-to see if the site will be      shaded. In the case of large systems, this may mean making      repeated measurements at the various corners of the      collector. When applied to roof-mounted collectors or high      windows that will be installed on an as-yetunbuilt home,      this can be cumbersome (if you try to position yourself at      the correct height) or complicated (if you try to project      shadow patterns to places you can't reach). Unfortunately,      in this case there are no simple shortcuts or substitutes      for diligent work.    </p>    <p>      A very accurate profile of the southern horizon can be      developed using a surveyor's transit. A compass and an      Abney level will allow you to prepare an acceptable shading      profile. The basic procedure is to plot the altitude angle      (height above the horizon in degrees, when horizontal is      0° and vertical is 90°) of the skyline at compass      point increments of 5° between 60° and 360°      (120° east and west azimuth of south). To use the      skyline profile you develop, you pick a sun-angle chart for      your latitude-TPSEB offers them in 4° increments      between 28° and 56° north latitude -and compare the      profile to the chart. The procedures are clearly described      in TPSEB, and an example is shown in Fig. 5.    </p>    <p>      It's less apparent, however, what one does to determine how      shading affects the actual total solar gain. To figure this      out, you have to first find the percentage of shading for      each hour by counting altitude boxes. Then each hour's      shading percentage-from half hour to the next half      hour-must be weighted by the amount of maximum gain      available during that hour. If 50% of the 9:00 A.M. hour      (8:30 to 9:30 A.M.) is shaded, the total loss of gain will      be much lower than if 50% of the 12:00 noon hour (11:30      A.M. to 12:30 P.M.) is shaded.    </p>				       <p>      From the example shown in Fig. 5, you can see that during      November, December, and January the collector will be      unshaded; during February and October, however, it'll be      shaded from 7:30 A.M. until 8:30 A.M.; March and September      shading stretches from 7:30 until 9:00 A.M.; and April and      August shading is from 7:30 until 8:00 A.M. This isn't a      great deal of loss: about 5% of total direct radiation on a      horizontal surface in February and October, 10% in March      and September, and 3% in April and August.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, a guess as to the extent of these morning      losses probably wouldn't have been far enough off to cause      problems. Nonetheless, you can't make an accurate estimate      of shading losses without knowing the per centage of daily      gain that falls in each hourly period. You can calculate      percentages from hourly radiation charts offered in books      such as TPSEB, or you can send an SASE to MOTHER, attention      Readers' Service, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, NC 28793,      and we'll send you a chart covering latitudes 28 through      52, in 4° increments. An example for Indianapolis is      shown in Fig. 6.    </p>    <p>      A reasonable alternative to developing your own shading      charts is to purchase a sitesurvey tool. There are several      excellent professional models on the market, but the      $80-plus price tags probably aren't justified for      preliminary site assessment. On the other hand, the Solar      Card is, at $12.95, a worthwhile tool that simplifies      shading assessment and offers a grid for determining      shading percentage (see MOTHER No. 77).    </p>    <h3>      PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER    </h3>        <p>      Once you have insolation figures for your locale from      reference books, and have adjusted them for any site      peculiarities and the percentage of shading, you can      determine the overall energy input. From this, you can      estimate the performance of various types of equipment      based on manufacturers' claims or, in the case of passive      systems, calculated gains.    </p>    <p>      Let's say that you're thinking about installing      photovoltaic panels on a house near Indianapolis. You've      determined that the site isn't significantly different from      the Indianapolis weather station. But it will be shaded by      a grand old white oak that has an altitude of 30° and      is located between 55 and 85° east azimuth. You don't      want to cut the tree down, and there's no better location      available for the panels. The losses are 5% in February and      October, 10% in March and September, and 3% in April and      August. The actual horizontal radiation, with shading      amounts subtracted, is shown in Fig. 7.    </p>    <p>      You may have noticed that up until now we've always spoken      of the available solar energy as that which falls on a      horizontal surface. Naturally, you probably don't intend to      mount your PV panels flat (and you certainly won't have      horizontal windows in your passive solar home). Use the      annual graph to find what annual average fraction of the      radiation on a horizontal surface will be available on an      angled collector (or the monthly graph for vertical      windows). Just multiply the horizontal radiation (corrected      for shading) by the number for latitude and collector      angle. Indianapolis latitude is about 40N, and the optimum      angle from Fig. 9 is 40°. (Note: An annual fraction of      energy captured by an angled collector should be sufcient      for most people, but if you need monthly fractions for      surfaces other than vertical or horizontal, send an SASE to      MOTHER, attention Readers' Service, at the address above.      Please include your latitude.)    </p>		       <p>      When you multiply the aggregate annual horizontal      radiation-the daily factor for each month times 30,      summing the months-by the angle factor, the annual      available energy for Indianapolis comes to about 515,000      Btu per square foot per year. (Note that you can't simply      multiply the angle factor by a given month to determine      performance for that period. The factor is an average of      the yearly optimal values, weighted for maximum system      performance.)    </p>		       <p>      This number-arrived at after all this research,      calculation, and fudging-is a pretty good      approximation of the amount of solar energy available to a      south-facing solar collection system at a particular site.      Orientations tions other than true south result in      different total amounts of gain and different percentages      of the total being allocated to various times of      day-a complicating factor beyond our scope here.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, what use you put the energy to will also have a      great effect on the useful output. The PV system we've      talked about will have an efficiency of between 5% and 7%      (And such systems are usually rated at an energy input of      317 Btu per square foot.) So for every 1,000 Btu per hour      in, you'll get back between 15 and 20 watts per hour (at      3.41 Btu per watt). An efcient solar water heater, on the      other hand, might capture somewhat more than half of the      available Btu.    </p>    <p>      Now it's up to you to put the numbers to work: The data you      develop in a site assessment are the takeof points for      system design and performance estimation.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Access</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Climatic Atlas of the United States</strong> , U.S.      Department of Commerce, 1983.

To correctly extrapolate      from a weather station to a particular site without      actually measuring the wind requires quite a bit of      guesswork-even after the most meticulous site survey. For      that reason, many times it's wise to correlate your own      measurements of wind speed, duration, and direction with      the published data before investing much money in      equipment.    </p>    <h3>      DECISION TIME    </h3>		       <p>      As you'll see in a few paragraphs, average wind speeds can      be very misleading if used to estimate the energy available      at a wind power site. They will, however, allow you to      decide whether it's worth devoting much time to studying      the wind energy possibilities on your land.    </p>    <p>      An airport near you should be able to provide you with the      average annual wind speed at that location. If not, the      National Climatic Data Center's publication Comparative      Climatic Data (see"Access") lists average and maximum wind      speeds for 285 locations.    </p>    <p>      Should your site be close to the measuring station,      comparable in terrain, and devoid of obstructions-trees,      buildings, etc.-within a distance equal to 15 times the      object's height, you can use these rules of thumb: When      annual average wind speed equals 8 mph or less, look for      another source of power. When annual average wind speed      equals 12 mph or more, plan to develop wind power. When      annual average wind speed is between 8 and 12 mph, take      measurements at the site, correlate them, and proceed      cautiously.    </p>    <h3>      A BIT OF THEORY    </h3>    <p>      What may seem like small differences in wind speed numbers      can make a big difference in the amount of energy      available-a situation you can understand only by looking at      what makes up the formula for wind energy:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Energy = 1/2 X air density X area of machine X wind      velocity 2</strong>    </p>    <p>      Air density affects the number of molecules in a given      volume of air striking a turbine's blades; area considers      the rotor's size; and the cube of the wind velocity      (velocity X velocity X velocity) takes the standard      momentum equation (v2) and multiplies by velocity one more      time to allow for the volume of air pass ing the turbine's      blade,    </p>    <p>      Look at what happens ii the » wind speed changes only      slightly: Let's say that your closest measuring station has      an average annual velocity of 11 mph, but the average      annual velocity at your site turns out to be only 9 mph.      The cube of 11 is 1,331 and the cube of 9 is 729. Though 9      mph is only about 18% less wind speed, the energy available      is 45T( less. To look at it another way, a 13 mph average      wind has more than twice as much energy as does a 10 mph      wind! Do you begin to see why little errors can make such a      difference?    </p>    <p>      The cubic influence of wind speed on power has another      important effect on the amount of energy available: Average      wind speeds may not give an accurate picture of available      energy. Consider the example of two sites that both have a      15 mph average wind speed. On the face of it, they would      seem to have the same wind energy potential. But do they      What if one site has constant 15 mph winds, and the other      has 10 mph winds half the time and 20 mph winds half the      time? Energy at the first site is proportional to the cube      of 15 (3,375); but at the second, it's proportional to the      cube of 10 (1,000) plus the cube of 20 (8,000), or 9,000.      There's more than twice as much energy in the wind at the      site with half 10 mph and half 20 n-;    </p>    <h3>      BEYOND AVERAGE.    </h3>    <p>      To get an even clearer picture of wind energy      possibilities, you need to use NCDC's more detailed data.      And before we go any further, you might as well get used to      the idea of dealing with the metric system; it's the      language of wind energy. From this point on in the article,      we're going metric, too. If you want to switch to English      units, find a calculator that will make the conversions or      multiply by the following conversion factors:    </p>    <p>      As we already mentioned, NCDC has wind measurements from      975 stations. These data are presented through the Wind      Energy Resource Information System (WERIS), and, as you'll      soon see, they're extensive and detailed. Start by writing      to NC DC (or calling 704/ 259-0682) and requesting a list      of WERIS stations in order to determine which one is      nearest you. There are 19 different tables-accounting      for 52 pages-available for each station, and there's no      point in ordering more photocopying than you need. We'll      show you how to use the more basic of the tables in the      following paragraphs.    </p>    <p>      Because there's no need at this point to consider the size      or performance characteristics of a particular wind      machine, the figure we'll be looking for is power      densitythe amount of power available per unit of wind      machine rotor area in watts per square meter (w/m2).    </p>    <h3>      FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE    </h3>    <p>      NCDC WERIS Table 11, "Percent, Frequency of Occurrence,      Wind Speed vs. Month," divides up wind velocities into      convenient bins-showing the percent of the time that the      wind speed falls into that range and time period. By      calculating the power of each bin and summing those      numbers, you can get an accurate picture of the power      available. An annual summation gives a picture of total      power density, and a monthly analysis tells you whether the      wind is likely to be sufficient to satisfy your energy      needs in a given month. An example (back to Indianapolis)      is shown in Fig. 1.    </p>		        <p>      You can't simply use the speed itself to determine the      power from each speed classonce again, because of the cube      effect. The power midpoint of each speed class is an      average of the powers available at the lowest and highest      speed in the class. For example, the speed range of the 3      m/sec class is 2.5 to 3.5 m/sec, and the power      midpoint-the cube root of half of the sum of the      cubes-is 3.08 m/sec.    </p>    <p>      Lucky for you, the NCDC computers have already done all      that ciphering for you. Fig. 2 includes some of those      figures, taken from WERIS Table 4.    </p>    <p>      Without the labor of calculation, we find that Indianapolis      has an annual average power density of 76 w/m2, with highs      and lows of 117 w/m2 and 32 w/m2 in January and August,      respectively. This power was determined at an anemometer      height of 6.1 meters and will vary at other heights.    </p>    <h3>      ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE    </h3>    <p>      Way back in the section on theory, the formula for power      contained an element for air density. Since then, we've      ignored it . . .but it's finally time to correct that      omission. Because air is less dense at higher altitudes and      higher temperatures and more dense at lower altitudes and      cooler temperatures, power density needs to be corrected      for any differences in altitude and temperature that exist      between the site and the measuring station.    </p>    <p>      For every 1,000 feet above sea level, density drops by 3%.      NCDC figures have taken the Indianapolis air density into      account in the annual power density figure of 76 w/m 2 . If      you're at a significantly higher or lower altitude than the      measuring station, however, the power density has to be      corrected for the difference. Likewise, significant      temperature differences-which might be experienced at      different altitudes-should be factored in by      multiplying power density by the correction numbers in Fig.      3.    </p>		        <h3>      WIND DIRECTION    </h3>    <p>      NCDC's Table 14 is another invaluable aid to wind power      site assessment. It tabulates the direction of wind by      power density, allowing you to determine what might be the      most crucial upwind direction for a machine. Fig. 4 shows      the distribution of power directions for Indianapolis.    </p>    <p>      Though wind power at the Indianapolis station is fairly      well distributed by direction, you can see that the      south-to-west quadrant is particularly important.      Assuming that your site has similar prevailing winds, it's      important to make sure that there are no obstructions close      to the windplant's location toward the south and west.    </p>    <h3>      EXTRAPOLATING TO YOUR SITE    </h3>    <p>      Relating wind data from an NCDC station to a site you're      studying is far more difficult (and chancy) than relating      weather or insolation information. This is because wind      velocity, direction, and turbulence are profoundly affected      by local topography, vegetation, and buildings.    </p>    <p>      When you choose a station from which to use data, read the      fine print to see what kind of location was used. Many      stations are located at airports, which are typically flat,      lowlying, and often unobstructed by nearby trees or      buildings; others are in municipal areas with lots of      buildings. Furthermore, locations for airports and cities      are generally selected for a lack of wind, so data      collection stations are seldom optimal wind power sites.      Compare the area around the wind station to that around the      site you're studying. There are three basic factors to      consider: roughness, topography, and barriers.    </p>    <p>      Surface roughness influences the way and the degree to      which upper-level winds are reduced by friction with the      ground. Different sorts of roughness characteristics and      their effects on wind speed at various heights are shown in      Fig. 5. Bear in mind that NCDC data is taken at different      heights at different locations and that the velocity (and      therefore power) must be corrected to take into account the      height at which the wind was measured. The formula for      calculating increase in power for additional height over      the measuring point is this:    </p>        <p>      The symbol a is the roughness factor, and it serves as the      exponent in the equation. For our example case of      Indianapolis, we've standardized the figures to the listed      anemometer height of 6.1 meters. If your .station is at a      different height, you'll have to work out the power      increase for yourself, using the equation above and the      roughness factors listed in Fig. 5. (In the case of tall      crops, woods, or buildings, be sure to consider the surface      to be at the level of the top of the obstacles.) Just      multiply the original power density by the appropriate      number for the height above the effective surface to arrive      at the corrected w/mz.    </p>		       <p>      If the roughness of the ground upwind from a site is      consistent, it's fairly simple to determine an acceptable      tower height based on the information in Fig. 5. That's      seldom the case, though, so you'll have to make educated      guesses about the overall effect of the combinations of      roughness at the site. Keep in mind, too, that when the      roughness changes-at the edge of a woods, for      example-there is a transition zone of intermediate values.      As a very rough guide, this might extend for a distance      equal to twice the height of the change upwind and 10 times      the height downwind.    </p>    <p>      Topography can have a dramatic effect on both the pattern      and the speed of wind. First, simply positioning a site on      a hill is roughly equivalent to having a taller tower; the      terrain lifts the machine up into the prevailing winds. The      ideal hill site is on the top onethird of the upwind side      of a ridge perpendicular to the wind, as shown in Fig. 6.      In this location, not only will the machine have the higher      winds available at altitude, but it will be in an area      where wind is accelerating to ride up over the ridge. This      effect can increase wind speed as much as 100% on the top      one-third of the upwind face of a ridge with an ideal slope      of around 30°70. By the same token, sites on the lower      two-thirds of the leading face or on the trailing face of a      ridge perpendicular to the wind may have significantly less      than the predicted wind.    </p>    <p>      Disruptive turbulence will be found on the trailing face of      perpendicular ridges. And at the top of ridges with flat      peaks or at the top of a cliff, there's likely to be an      area of wind shear: a zone where the normal increase in      wind speed with height above the surface is disrupted,      resulting in a sharp difference in speed over a short      vertical distance. Wind shear can place the upper and lower      parts of a wind machine's rotor in drastically different      wind speeds, which would exert tremendous stress on the      equipment.    </p>    <p>      Terrain can also redirect the wind's prevailing pattern.      For example, in the case of the ridge we were just      discussing, wind may funnel around its ends or through a      pass. On the upper one-third, such sites may be excellent      for wind power. Similarly, valleys may direct wind down      from mountains into basins in the cool morning and back up      in the heat of the afternoon. At the lower end of these      valleyswhere there's not enough constriction to cause heavy      turbulence-a machine on a sufficiently high tower may      get a boost from the daily cycles.    </p>		        <p>      Unfortunately, topography seldom cooperates by fitting      textbook descriptions. Unless the situation is quite      obvious, in areas of significant hilliness you'd be wise to      make direction and power measurements of your own and      correlate them with the data from the nearest measuring      station.    </p>    <p>      Barriers upwind from a wind machine produce wakes that are      more turbulent and have lower speed than the prevailing      wind. As a rule of thumb, avoid any site where a barrier of      a given height will be twice that height laterally downwind      or 15 times that height upwind, as we show you in Fig. 7.      The width of a barrier also plays a role in wind      disruption. Amazing as it may seem, a single tree can      reduce wind speed by 10% at a distance downwind as great as      30 times the tree's width. In other words, a 25-foot-wide      tree could reduce wind speed by 10% at a point 750 feet      downwind! To avoid this sort of problem, plan on using a      tower that will put the wind machine 25 feet above any      barrier that's within 500 feet in the direction from which      winds of significant power come.    </p>		        <p>      These same guidelines apply for ridges or tree lines (such      as shelterbelts) upwind from a wind power site. And in the      case of a shelterbelt, the density of the growth has an odd      effect: The most disruptive tree lines directly upwind are      comparatively porous-that is, they have low      vegetation density; medium porosity leads to the greatest      lateral disturbance; and very dense growth in a shelterbelt      produces the fewest problems.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, analyzing the similarities between a wind      power site and a nearby measuring station requires, at      best, quite a bit of subjective judgment. Before making any      major investment, you should put any doubts to rest by      measuring the wind.    </p>    <h3>      MEASUREMENT    </h3>        <p>      If you have concerns about roughness, topography, or      barriers at a site, you should, as a minimum, determine the      power-wind directions) so you can estimate how serious the      effects of the site's characteristics will be. A simple      wind sock (or weather vane) on a pole and a notebook may      give you enough information, as long as you're      conscientious about making observations and recording them.      A wind-direction and-speed meter is more convenient      and will give you a better idea of where the strong winds      are coming from. (TJ Byers described how to build such a      device for less than $20 in MOTHER NO. 68.)    </p>		       <p>      However, you'll need more sophisticated equipment to      correlate power density at a measuring station with that at      your site. A wind odometer is an improvement over an      anemometer that merely measures instantaneous speed. (More      Other Homes and Garbage describes how to build a wind      odometer from a pocket calculator.) It will provide you      with an average wind speed, which can be corrected to a      power density range by using the factors shown in Fig. 8.    </p>    <p>      The only way to get more accurate numbers is to use a      recording anemometer, a device that differs from a standard      anemometer or wind odometer in that it tallies wind speeds      (and directions, if you like) and drops the frequencies of      occurrence of various velocities into the appropriate      registers-producing a total for each speed group over the      period. Unfortunately, recording anemometers are      prohibitively expensive for our purposes.    </p>    <p>      You'd actually be better off buying or building a small      wind machine and equipping it with a watt-hour meter.      (MOTHER offers plans for several different inexpensive wind      machines-see page 100 for information.) Such an      approach would give you numbers equal to the power density      times the efciency of the machine-nearly 10% for the      Blue Max and 20% for the 2000-watt windplant, two      designs MOM offers-and would leave you with a useful      piece of hardware once the measuring was done.    </p>    <p>      If you go on to purchase a sophisticated wind power system,      you'll want to know how it will respond to the wind      characteristics at your site. The machine's efciency curve      will influence what percentage of different speeds it can      make use of, and its cut-in and cutout speeds will      determine what portion of the available winds it can      capture. By judiciously applying the manufacturer's or      dealer's specifications to your site assessment, you should      obtain a performance estimate that will leave you with few      surprises.    </p>
