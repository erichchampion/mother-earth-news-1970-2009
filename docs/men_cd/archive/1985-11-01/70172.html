                    <p>      A tree stand can open a new world to the outdoorsperson.      Here are two that you can make.    </p>        <p>      People who appreciate the outdoors realize that it's      necessary to be <em>unobtrusive</em> if you're to best      enjoy its appeal; those who are least conspicuous are most      likely to view nature's surprisingly busy agenda. To a      hunter or wildlife photographer, this frequently means      picking an advantageous spot in the woods and simply      staying put until something of interest comes along. And,      for a number of reasons, the best spot is often one a dozen      or more feet off the ground . . . where the lanes of sight      are less obstructed, the view is nearly panoramic, and the      possibility of human scent being noticed is reduced      considerably.<br />      <br />      The two tree stands that we've detailed here can both      provide efficient observation or shooting platforms. One is      a stationary stand that folds flat, weighs 20 pounds, and      can be hauled up a tree with a line or positioned with the      help of a ladder. Once raised, it's chained, top and      bottom, around the trunk of the tree and secured with lever      binders that draw the coils tight. The foot platform      measures a comfortable 23" X 31", and the seat is contoured      to accommodate the thighs. The metal parts are lightweight      extruded aluminum, available from a fabricator's supply      house . . . but steel angle and channel can be used as an      alternative if weight is not a factor.<br />      <br />      Since installing the stationary model is enough of a chore      to convince most people to leave the stand in place for an      extended period once it's secured to a tree, it's best      suited for use on private property rather than public lands      (where, in most cases, tree stands must be removed daily).      Therefore, we've also illustrated a two-piece climbing      version that has staggered girths that grip the tree trunk      when the platforms are in a horizontal position. To use it,      a climber merely has to stand on the installed foot      platform with the seat section dug in overhead, then pull      him- or herself up-using the built-in      handles-while lifting the lower platform with the      foot loops provided. Once the bottom section is locked in      its new position, the process is repeated until the desired      height is achieved.<br />      <br />      The framework on this model is 1/8" X 1" angle iron, which      should easily support an average-sized individual . . .      but, if necessary, feel free to upgrade the stand by using      larger sections of angle . . . and, of course, check all of      the components for signs of wear before taking to the      trees. Eight pairs of mounting holes allow the girths to be      adjusted to suit the diameter of the trunk you choose to      climb, and nylon utility straps help secure the grip once      you've attained the height you want.<br />      <br />      Before you start your trek into the wilderness, keep these      points in mind: Never climb a tree while carrying sharp or      pointed equipment that could injure you in a fall; instead,      pull your gear up once you're perched. Always wear a safety      belt and extension strap when using a tree stand, no matter      how comfortable you feel with heights. And please be      considerate of the forest that's hosting your visit; choose      a tree that'll require little or no trimming, so your      impact on it will be minimal.    </p>
