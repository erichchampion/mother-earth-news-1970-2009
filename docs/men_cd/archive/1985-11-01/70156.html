                        <p>      After the fire of autumn has passed and only a few brown,      withered leaves hold out against the cold, the vivid fruit      of the wahoo dangles conspicuously on the bush. Indians and      settlers waited until this season to search for the plant,      when its medicinal qualities were at their peak and it was      the focal point of the bared woods.<br />      There are four species of wahoo native to the U.S. Three      are widespread east of the plains: <em>Euonymus      atropurpurea</em> is a small tree, while <em>E.      americana</em> is an upright shrub and <em>E. obovata</em>      is a trailing one. <em>E. occidentalis</em> is a shrub or      small tree of the Pacific states.<br />      <br />      All can be readily identified by their dark green twigs,      which have four distinct ridges and are usually quite      square. Their leaves are opposite, and their fruits hang      from stalks arising from the leaf axils. In summer, the      wahoos are relatively inconspicuous, their small green or      maroon flowers hardly noticeable among the leaves. But in      the colder months, the wahoo is twice beautiful-first      when its fall leaves turn brilliant red or pale yellow, and      again when its fruits hang from bare limbs, their husks      splitting to reveal the glossy seeds. <em>E. americana</em>      is particularly noteworthy in this regard, for its      strawberry-like seed case bursts wide, and its four orange      seeds hang precariously from the tips of the husk. In      reference to its winter color, the wahoo is sometimes      called burning bush; <em>E. americana</em> , for its      evocative winter display, has also earned the names      strawberry bush and hearts-a-burstin'.    </p>                    <p>      Though the four species of wahoo differ somewhat in      appearance, their active medicinal principles seem to be      similar. The Winnebago Indians, who most frequently      encountered <em>E. atropurpurea</em> , used the inner bark      of that species to treat uterine disorders. The Meskwakis      made an eye lotion and a poultice for facial sores from the      bark, and the Mohicans used it as a purgative. The fact      that the word <em>wahoo</em> probably derives from a Dakota      word meaning "arrow-wood" suggests that Native Americans      also discovered more militant uses for the hard,      close-grained wood.<br />      <br />      Europeans and other newcomers valued wahoo bark      particularly as a treatment for liver disorders; it was      believed to be cathartic, diuretic, and laxative, and in      small doses was said to stimulate the appetite and the flow      of gastric juices. An oil extracted from the seed of E.      atropurpurea was used to kill head lice, and the bark of      <em>E. americana</em> was powdered to treat dandruff. It      was not until this century that the seed's digitalis-like      effect on the heart was discovered, with the result that      the wahoo enjoyed brief popularity as a heart medicine.      Even in minute doses, however, the seeds are violently      emetic and possibly poisonous; for this reason they should      never be ingested in any form. The bark should be used only      by experienced herbalists.<br />      <br />      <em>E. americana</em> is well suited to cultivation, and is      hardy as far north as southern New England. When planted in      the open, the usually spindly bush fills out and will even      tolerate pruning. It never develops a thick cover of      leaves, but the dense structure of its green twigs makes it      an interesting specimen plant summer and winter.      (Woodlanders, 1128 Colleton Ave., Aiken, SC 29801, offers      <em>E. americana</em> in half-gallon containers for $5.50      each.
