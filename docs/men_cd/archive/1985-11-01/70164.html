            			    <p>      Don't let the joys of the season go to waist! Now you can      indulge (in holiday goodies) and not bulge (in all the      obvious places).    </p>    <p>      A year ago last summer, MOTHER's pages featured an      eight-piece home fitness center made almost exclusively of      dimensional lumber (see issues 87, page 112, and 88, page      98). Designed and used regularly by competition bodybuilder      Carlos DeJesus, the wooden gym helped its creator win a few      national championships . . . all for an investment of less      than $200! <br /> <br /> Now, equipment like Carlos's would be ideal for      those people who plan to undertake a complete fitness      program . . . but the additional investment in plates,      bars, and other accessories might be prohibitive to      individuals who simply want to maintain physical tone and      hold off the assault of extra pounds. Consequently,      MOTHER's research staff developed two inexpensive pieces of      equipment that are flexible enough to be used with the      wooden fitness center or, on their own, as a means of      keeping (or attaining) a trim waistline. Like the DeJesus      designs, they're straightforward and can be built with      common hand tools . . . so what are you waiting for?    </p>    <h3>      SIT-UP BENCH    </h3>		    <p>      Our first fitness tool is an inclined platform, complete      with a padded foot bar, which allows you to do anatomically      correct sit-ups. The bar guarantees that your knees will be      in the recommended bent position, while the incline lets      gravity be a little harder on you to assure a worthwhile      workout. <br /> <br /> Start by locating one 16" and two 60" lengths of      1" thinwall conduit, commonly known as electrical metallic      tubing (EMT). If you buy it from a contractor's scrap pile,      perhaps you'll be able to borrow a conduit bender that'll      allow you to make the necessary 50° and 70° arcs in      the tubes that form the legs. (Ideally, the completed bends      should be separated by 24" of straight tube, and the foot      of the bench should be 17", and the head 12", off the      floor.) <br /> <br /> After the arcs are formed, use 1/4" X 2" carriage      bolts to fasten the 11-1/4" X 20" platform to the unbent      portions of the two pieces of conduit so that about 4" of      board hangs over the end. The longer legs should be to      gether and parallel and the shorter ones about 9-1/2" apart      at the top and splayed slightly outward at the bottom. (If      you feel you need a wider stance, allow for it when you      bend the conduit.) Tie the two leg sections together with      1/4" X 2-1/2" bolts placed through the adjoining members. <br /> <br />      Finally, fasten the 16" length of conduit halfway up the      parallel legs, using two more 2-1/2" bolts, and pad the      exposed metal with appropriately sized lengths of      polyethylene pipe insulation. (You'll probably have to use      contact cement to hold the split jackets in place.) Finish      up by pushing furniture tips onto all the exposed conduit      ends and, if you wish, gluing a section of scrap carpet to      the upper surface of the platform.    </p>    <h3>      INVERSION MACHINE    </h3>		    <p>      Some consider it a costly novelty, and others wouldn't      consider stretching without it . . . but we'll have to      admit that short stints on this "back stretcher" seem to      have a decided unkinking effect on tension-tired torsos and      work-stressed sacroiliacs. What's more, this inversion      machine provides the positioning for some hearty work on      the waist, stomach, and lower back. <br /> <br /> The chrome-and-foam      versions offered in numerous mail-order catalogs can be      fairly pricey . . . but this wooden whoops-a-daisy costs      only about $30 to build and does the same job. When you      select the lumber for this project, be sure to choose      pieces that are straight and nearly knot-free. Likewise,      don't skimp on the fastening hardware. Use the screw sizes      recommended, countersink the heads, and double-lock all      joints by using a good yellow furniture glue. <br /> <br /> Note that the      33-1/2" 2 X 6 across the top of the legs is held in place      with eyebolts dropped into one of three sets of sockets      spaced 3-1/2" apart. This board, and the 2 X 4 adjacent to      it, are equipped with rubberhose bumpers for the head of      the back platform; the user's weight distribution will      determine where the stop board is placed, or whether it's      used at all.  <br /> <br />The cradle and platform assembly deserves      especially careful fitting. Be certain the butted joints      are sound and free of splits, and don't use any shelf      bracket smaller than the one indicated. To maintain the      proper balance, attach the cradle so its upper edge is      35-1/4" from the top end of the platform, and center the      floor flanges exactly 2-1/2" from the rounded edge of the      cradle arms.  <br /> <br />The ankle straps are simply 34" lengths of      nylon seat belt material secured to the foot platform      beneath two 16-gauge metal plates, which are large enough      to allow the panhead fastening screws to secure the straps      without actually passing through the belt webbing. Velcro      hook-and-loop tape strips firmly stitched to the ends of      the belts lock each strap's tails together. (The belts pass      under the insteps, and the tails cross in front of the      ankles and join at the back . . . hence the mating Velcro      must be sewn to opposite faces of each strap.) <br /> <br /> Once the      cradle's installed in the framework (capped 1/2" pipe      nipples passed through 7/8" holes in the frame uprights      make inexpensive and sturdy pivot pins), you can assemble      and place the counterweights. Each unit is simply an      11-1/8" section of 3" thinwall polyvinyl chloride (PVC)      pipe filled with sand and plugged at the ends. With the      central rod, nuts, and mounting brackets installed, each      unit should weigh just about five pounds. The brackets hook      around the edges of the back platform, and the wing nuts      tighten or release these simple clamps. <br /> <br /> Using the inversion      machine requires some degree of experimentation, but the      procedure is essentially the same for everyone. The idea is      to strap your ankles in place, then have a friend slide the      counterweights along the board until the platform is nearly      balanced in a horizontal position when your hands are on      your chest. At this point, he or she can secure the weights      in position, and you should be able to control your rate of      inversion by raising your hands and arms above your head      accordingly . . . and, of course, return to an upright      stance by moving them toward your feet. <br /> <br /> Common sense would      dictate that-especially at first-you should stay suspended      only for a minute or so to let your body "unwind" . . . and      that you consult a book on using inversion machines before      attempting more advanced exercises, Furthermore, if you      have high blood pressure or any reservations about the      effects of being upturned, consult your physician before      jumping "head over heels" into this project.    </p>
