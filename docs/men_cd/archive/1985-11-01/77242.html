                <hr />    <h3>      Eau de Deodar</h3>      <p>      The existence of a natural insecticide with a fragrance      pleasant enough to recommend it as a perfume has been      reported by researchers in India. The repellent is an oil      obtained from the deodar cedar tree ( <em>Cedrus      deodara</em> ), a native of the Himalayas, which is planted      in the warmer parts of the U.S. as an ornamental. The oil      of this tree has long been used in India to discourage      clothes moths and beetles, but the researchers found that a      mere 1% concentration was just as effective against      mosquitoes.</p>      <h3>BT: The Hazards of Success</h3>      <p>      <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> (BT) has proved to be a      relatively safe, versatile, and effective biological      insecticide which can all but replace chemical controls in      many applications. But recent research indicates that if we      continue to use BT as indiscriminately as we have chemical      controls, we'll be faced with many of the same old      problems-including insect resistance. William      McGaughey, an entomologist for the U.S. Grain Marketing      Research Laboratory in Manhattan, Kansas, has found that      insects can develop high rates of resistance to BT in less      than a year. The insects McGaughey experimented with      developed as much resistance to the biological insecticide      as they might have been expected to develop when exposed to      chemical insecticides, but whereas it might have taken 30      or 40 generations for chemically treated bugs to acquire      that degree of resistance, the biologically treated bugs      did it in 15. So far, resistant populations have been found      only in grain stores, where BT is more stable and      persistent. But McGaughey believes a similar resistance      could begin to develop outdoors with increased use of the      biological pesticide.</p>      <h3>Appropriate Contraception</h3>      <p>      Breast-feeding could be more important than modern      contraceptives in influencing population growth in many      developing countries, according to Cornell University      scientist Michael C. Latham, who is involved in a study of      infant feeding practices in Kenya and Indonesia. Because      frequent and intensive breast-feeding can delay fertility      in new mothers, women who don't breast-feed can give birth      to twice as many children in a given time span as those who      do. Latham's research indicates that an important factor in      Kenya's rate of population growth, which is currently the      highest in the world, may be that the majority of Kenyan      women regularly start bottle-feeding their children two or      three months after birth. Latham noted that breastfeeding      could be promoted as part of a total contraceptive program      in those countries that have been resistant to modern      contraceptives. Mothers in such nations might be persuaded      to breast-feed their children regularly if they understood      the immediate health and economic benefits of nursing, the      researcher believes.</p>      <h3>WaterWatch</h3>      <p>      Culligan International Company, a major manufacturer of      water-conditioning devices, has announced the installation      of a "WaterWatch" hotline designed to field consumer      questions about water quality. The WaterWatch number is      800/792-0092, and specially trained operators are prepared      to answer your queries concerning your home water sources      for cooking, bathing, and drinking.<br />      Consumers calling the tollfree number, staffed from 9 A.M.      to 5 P.M. Central Standard Time, not only will have their      questions answered, but will also receive a free brochure,      "What You Should Know About the Water You Drink."</p>      <h3>Work Sick</h3>        <p>      If going to work seems to bring you down, you may be      suffering from more than just the routine. Doctors have, in      recent years, identified an ailment they call building      sickness, with symptoms including inflamed nasal passages,      sniffles, dry throat, headache, and lethargy. The syndrome      is common enough to be recognized in many countries as an      important cause of lagging productivity. Now a survey      published by the <em>British Medical Journal</em> indicates      that workers in artificially vented spaces are twice as      likely to complain of building sickness as those in      naturally ventilated areas. Nasal inflammation was five      times more common in people working in air-conditioned and      humidified offices than it was in those working in      naturally ventilated ones; stopped-up noses and dry throats      were complained of three times as often; and lethargy and      headaches were twice as common. The authors of the report      have not been able to identify a specific      cause-levels of carbon monoxide, ozone, formaldehyde,      air velocity, and humidity did not differ significantly in      the closed and open environments-but the remedy seems      simple enough: Open a window.</p>      <h3>Savory Grasslands</h3>        <p>      Wildlife biologist Allan Savory's controversial range      management plan for the arid Southwest-based on his      contention that grass needs grazing (see MOTHER N0. 91,      page 138)-is beginning to sound a little more      conventional these days. A Syracuse University researcher      has made field observations in the Serengeti Plain of      Northwest Africa that tend to support the notion that the      grazing of herds of wild animals promotes the development      of healthy grasses. After measuring the height, mass, and      growth characteristics of plants growing on the plains, he      found that nibbled grasses were actually thicker and      hardier. Savory, a native of Zimbabwe, asserts that the      grasslands of the American plains can be properly      maintained only by simulating the grazing habits of the      herds of bison and antelope that once roamed this      continent. Many had criticized what they considered to be      Allan's unscientific approach to range management-but      current research seems to be confirming at least a few of      his claims.    </p>
