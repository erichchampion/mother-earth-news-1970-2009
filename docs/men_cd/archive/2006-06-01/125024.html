        <p>Create a unique, easy-to-make bookshelf using an old wooden ladder and recycled wood. By building your own rustic bookcase, youâ€™ll save money and have a one-of-a-kind addition to your home.</p><p>First, cut a sturdy 25-foot wooden ladder into four equal lengths. This should give you enough to make end supports for two bookshelves. Stand two of the supports upright and add wooden shelves between the rungs. Consider using reclaimed wood from a barn or outbuilding for the shelves, or simply recycle wood from other household projects for a low-cost option. After screwing the shelves to the supports, bolt the supports to the wall.</p><p>For a more rustic bookshelf, leave the ladder hardware and rough edges intact and skip the paint. Or paint the shelves and rungs in custom colors to create a colorful accent for any room.</p>
