        The rates of diabetes and obesity are rising rapidly in the UnitedStates. Although many factors can contribute to these problems,good nutrition is essential in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.Carbohydrates are essential for balanced nutrition, so it'simportant to consider how many and what type of carbohydrates youeat.<br /><br />People should get about 50 percent of their calories fromcarbohydrates. The carbs you need are <i>complex</i> carbohydratesfound in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, which offer valuablenutrients and fiber.<br /><br />Fiber increases digestion time, thus slowing glucose absorptionfrom the intestines, and lowers both cholesterol and blood sugar.Furthermore, whole grains help the body become more responsive toinsulin. Try to eat 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day consisting ofwhole grains ? whole-wheat rather than white bread, brown ratherthan white rice ? and experiment with alternative grains such aswhole oats, barley and bulgur. Another good source of fiber isbeans, which provide about 7 grams of fiber per serving. You shouldeat at least five servings a day of fruits and vegetables, andavoid simple carbohydrates (candy) and refined carbohydrates (whitebread), which provide mostly 'empty' calories and contain almost nofiber.<br /><br />For more information on better food choices, visit the<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food" target="_blank">Real FoodPage</a> on<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/" target="_blank">MotherEarthNews.com</a>.
