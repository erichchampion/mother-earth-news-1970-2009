        <h5>Issue #216, June/July 2006</h5><h3>Green Gazette</h3><p>Almost half the worldâ€™s original forests have disappeared, one-fifth since the late 1950s. This accelerated deforestation leads to soil erosion, higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and wildlife habitat loss. For your next DIY project, first look for salvaged or reclaimed wood. Another way to use wood responsibly is to purchase products certified by the nonprofit Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) as originating from a sustainably managed forest. FSC sets standards for fair labor and responsible environmental practices - such as preventing soil erosion, protecting rare species and limiting pesticide use - in forestry operations worldwide. Just look for the FSC label on wood products. For more information or help finding FSC-certified wood, go to <a href="http://www.fscus.org/" target="_blank">http://www.fscus.org</a>.</p>
