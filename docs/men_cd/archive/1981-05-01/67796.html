                <p>      You can save money and handle homestead towing and tying      tasks more safely with . . .    </p>    		     <p>      Over the last 20 years, the once simple act of picking out      and using a length of rope has become pretty complicated: A      profusion of new synthetic lines has joined the natural      varieties on hardware store shelves . . . forcing baffled      buyers to choose among well over a dozen combinations of      fiber and twisting style.    </p>    <p>      Of course, each of the numerous ropes that are available is      better suited for some tasks than it is for others, and the      material that the cord is made of will likely require      specific care. So we decided that it might be helpful to      describe several of the more common ropes . . . and tell      you what they're good for, as well as what steps should be      taken to get the maximum life from each type.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TWISTING THE RIGHT-AWAY</strong>    </p>    <p>      In its most simple form, rope consists of long fibers that      are first twisted (usually in a clockwise fashion) to form      yarns. Then a number of the wound strings are spun      together, in the opposite direction, to yield strands . . .      which are in turn twisted back in a right-hand direction      (in groups of three) to make "hawser-laid" rope.    </p>    <p>      The combination of these counterdirectional twists gives      the finished cord more strength than that of the individual      fibers composing it, since the friction between the fibers,      yarns, and strands increases the line's resistance to      stretch. Furthermore, the winding process prevents the      material from unraveling. (In fact, if you take a good      piece of three-strand rope and attempt to untwist it in the      middle, you'll notice that, after about one quarter-turn,      it vigorously resists unwinding.)    </p>    <p>      There are, however, a number of other ways to "lay-up" a      rope. Although they are somewhat rare, it's possible to      locate left-handlaid three-strand ropes, and even      four-strand ropes. But braiding is by far the most common      of the alternative twist techniques. It's accomplished by      weaving Height (or more) strands together in a "di amond"      pattern . . . and produces a rope that's very flexible,      doesn't tend to curl, and stretches even less than does a      twisted rope made of the same material and of equal      diameter. (Not surprisingly, braided-sometimes called      plaited-line's superior qualities result in its      having the highest average price tag of all ropes.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>SYNTHETIC VS. NATURAL</strong>    </p>    <p>      From a utilitarian point of view, synthetic fiber ropes      have a number of advantages over natural lines. For a given      diameter, they are stronger, more resistant to most types      of decay, and only slightly more expensive than the      nonsynthetics.    </p>    <p>      Such "artificial" lines are, for the most part,      manufactured from by-products of the oil refining process,      and therefore depend upon nonrenewable raw materials. (In      fact, polyethylene ropes are made from ethylene, a      petroleum substance that can also be used to produce ethyl      alcohol, or fuel ethanol.) Compounds obtained from the      hydrocarbons are extruded and drawn, and-depending      upon the fastidiousness: of the production process can be      formed into threads that extend for the entire length of a      rope (a feature not possible with natural fibers). The      finest nylon lines are made by this "continuous filament"      method, and are easy to distinguish from the fuzzier "spun"      nylon ropes.    </p>    <p>      Despite the advantages of synthetic fibers, many folks      still prefer the relatively strong, easy-to-handle,      economical natural lines. Manila is the most popular of the      plant-derived ropes (it comes from abaca, a bananalike      plant). In fact, among seafarers (and landlubbers) who do      fancy work with rope, manila is considered the only choice.      A less preferred-and less expensive-option is sisal, which      takes its raw materials from a species of Mexican cactus.      And hemp, which was once a common top-quality rope made      from fibers in the stems of Cannabis (marijuana) plants,      has become quite difficult to find.    </p>    <p>      The relative strengths of the-common natural and synthetic      ropes (as well as their resistance to the elements and      their stretch, cost, etc.) are compared in the chart that      accompanies this article. (It is important to note that the      performance of two firms' versions of the same kind of rope      is likely to vary more than will the performance of two      different kinds from the same manufacturer. Be sure to      check the factory specifications, which will be available      for many quality ropes.)    </p>    <p>      For general farmstead needs, the two most useful types of      line are manila and nylon. The former has very little      stretch, takes knots well without slipping, and can easily      be spliced and employed in permanent applications. Nylon,      on the other hand, has a significantly higher breaking      strength than any other common rope, and has a tremendous      ability to stretch and absorb shock loads. In addition,      it's unaffected by water, sunlight, and alkaline chemicals      and is very easy to handle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROPE CARE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Whatever a particular rope's durability and resistance to      the elements may be, the line won't last long at all if      it's abused . . . and proper care begins with putting it      away after each use.    </p>    <p>      Ropes-whether they are synthetic or natural-should always      be coiled up and hung in a dry place for storage. Of      course, when a line is brand-new, you'll find that it won't      stay in a neat coil. One way to convince an "unruly" rope      to cooperate is to coil it once or twice in a left-hand      direction (for hawserlaid ropes) and then coil it in a      clockwise fashion (If, however, you invest in a braided      rope, you'll find it easiest to coil it in a figure-eight      pattern.)    </p>    <p>      One should never leave frayed ends on a good piece of rope      . . . once the line has begun to unravel, that "unwound"      portion will have to be discarded! Natural fiber ropes      should be whipped (a method of (continued from preceding      page) binding the line's tips) with either a good synthetic      whipping twine or a natural fiber such as waxed linen.      There are a number of different ways to whip a rope's end      (which are detailed in the books recommended at the      conclusion of this article), but "common" and "sailor's"      whipping (shown in the photos) are two of the more popular      approaches.    </p>    <p>      Another way to prevent unwinding in a natural fiber rope is      to back-splice it (again, see the accompanying photos).      Back splicing, however, can be used only when the rope will      not have to pass through a restriction-such as a pulley      block-since the splice increases the end's diameter      significantly.    </p>    <p>      Synthetic lines are generally protected from unraveling by      either melting the fibers in their tips or by applying a      length of shrink tubing to their ends. (Alternatively, it's      possible to apply whipping to the ends of synthetic rope,      just as you would when dealing with natural fibers.)      Whichever method you choose, it's particularly important      that the binding be secure .... since synthetics seem to be      more inclined to unravel than are the natural ropes.    </p>    <p>      Finally, you should know that some lines are more resistant      to certain environmental conditions and uses than others.      The accompanying chart sets forth the basic considerations,      but manufacturers' specifications should also be looked      over carefully. For example, most polypropylene and      polyethylene ropes can't be used where they'll regularly be      subject to direct sunlight, but some factories do apply      ultraviolet inhibitors to such lines, eliminating or      alleviating that problem.    </p>    <p>      <strong>APPLICATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      When you're trying to decide which rope to use for a      particular job, it's important to consider both the working      load and the breaking strength of the cord in question.      While all natural fiber lines are rated for regular working      loads of about 20% of their breaking strength, nylon is      usually rated for a working load that is 11 % of its      breaking strength . . . because of its tendency to stretch.      Hence, nylon might be perfect for a towing application      where the rope needs to flex and the load will vary      considerably. But in a situation where an object needs to      be held in position-such as when a rope is used to      temporarily guy a tower-a low-stretch manila might be a      good choice.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, there are a few basic rules for the use of any      rope. When you're bending a rope around pulley blocks, for      example, the diameter of the pulley should be at least      eight times that of the rope. And in any application where      a line is permanently affixed to either another line or to      some object, use a splice rather than a knot . . . since it      places less stress on the fibers. Of course, there are      times when a knot is the only practical choice. In such      cases, find out what the right "tie" for the job is and use      it (see "How to Tie the Ten Most Useful Knots", on page 80      of issue 57). You'll insure your own safety, and your rope      will last longer as a result.    </p>    <p>      Even under the best of conditions, all fibers-either      natural or synthetic-will wear out. You should learn      to recognize the symptoms, and put a deteriorating line out      of service before an accident happens. Most natural ropes      tend to become quite limp when they're nearing the end of      their useful career. The surface will become soft and      fuzzy, the color will turn to a dull gray, and the inner      filaments will have crumbled to dust. Synthetic fibers,      however, don't offer such clear warnings. Generally, they      will become limp and soft-and, in the case of the      ropes affected by ultraviolet light, the color may      change-but the interior fibers may, to the eye,      appear unaffected. To inspect such a rope, bend the      material and study the condition of the surface fibers . .      . if they're excessively frayed, it's time to retire the      line.    </p>    <p>      But don't throw away rope that's a little too old to be      trusted. There are likely to be many short sections that      can be turned into all manner of useful objects. Sailors      have fashioned everything from handles to door mats out of      old lines, and there are numerous working applications for      tired rope, too: It can be used to make bumpers and      grommets, for instance.    </p>    <p>      As you pay more attention to the lines you use, you may      find yourself becoming more interested in the time-honored      art of ropecraft. There's a real pleasure in working a      quality section of rope, and the results of an expert's      handiwork can often teeter on the boundary between function      and art.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to learn more about the craft      of working with rope, two excellent books on the subject      are The Marlinspike Sailor by Hervey Garrett Smith,      published by John De Graff, Inc. ($7.95) . . . and Modern      Rope Seamanship by Colin Jarman and Bill Beavis, published      by International Marine Publishing Company ($12.50).    </p>
