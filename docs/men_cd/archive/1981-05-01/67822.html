                <p>      <em>A pleasant summer's stroll can probably take you to a      veritable supermarket of a bush!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Marion Lillie</h5>         <p>      Upon moving from the Midwest to the Idaho mountains, I was      faced with the task of learning how to recognize scads of      new woodland plants. Somehow, though -no matter where      I might look-one particular shrub kept catching my      eye. At first I simply noticed the plentiful plant's showy      compound leaves . . . each with 5 to 11 leaflets. But then      in June (after everything else had bloomed) this tall bush      suddenly became a striking hillside ornamental packed with      clusters of delicate white flowers. Still later-right at      the ragged end of summer-the blossoms were      transformed into bunches of tiny purple berries . . . and      some of those tasty-looking, double-handful-sized fruit      clumps became so heavy their stems drooped down with the      weight!    </p>    <p>      When I quizzed my nearest neighbor about this abundant yet      mysterious shrub, she said, "Why, they're plain of      good-eatin' elderberries, child." So I decided to harvest a      few fruity clusters and kitchen-test them! The berries were      so easy to pick that I was able to gather a bagful in no      time at all. I soon found out, though, that the tedious      task of separating the individual fruits from their tiny      twigs more than made up for the "pickability" of the      manyberried clumps. And to tell the truth, the little      morsels didn't taste all that good to me raw, either      (though I've learned since then that some folks like 'em      fine that way).    </p>    <p>      I was beginning to wonder if this particular wild food      wasn't better left in the woods. But then I started cooking      with elderberries, and I quickly reversed my opinion. The      tidbits were downright delectable when baked (especially if      I added a touch of lemon to my fixings): I just used elders      in my blueberry recipes ... and turned out dandy pies,      cobblers, and muffins. (The fruits became naturally mellow      and mouthwatering as soon as I'd dried a few bunches, too.)    </p>        <p>      Once I'd achieved these culinary successes, I became so      enchanted with elderberries that I even researched the      curious plant in a field guide . . . and learned that blue,      purple, and black specimens of Sambucus canadensis are      common all over the U.S., and all are renowned for being      finer sources of vitamin C than even oranges or tomatoes!      There is also a less-common red-fruited      variety-Sambucus racemosa-that's been reported      to make some folks sick. However, since the good elders are      all blue, purple, or black when ripe . . . the racemosa      berries are easy to avoid.    </p>    <p>      After my initial enthusiastic elderberry spree, I had to      catch up on a number of neglected homestead chores and      pretty much forgot about the foraged fruit for a couple of      weeks. Then one morning the same neighbor who first told me      about elderberries sent her two boys over ... and those      youngsters had brought me shopping bags stuffed with the      purple clusters. The fruit actually looked a little old and      dull to me, butwhen I called up to thank the kind      woman-she explained that those elder rounds came from      her special patch . . . and that the dusty look of the      berries meant they had reached the peak of ripeness. "That      'bloom' is caused by the light frosts we've been having,"      she told me. "You watch. The birds will gobble up all the      berries now."    </p>    <p>      <strong>ELDERBERRY JELLY</strong>    </p>    <p>      I was glad to have such an abundant supply of berries, but      I didn't feel like "detwigifying" every single purple fruit      . . . so I decided to simply clean out the leaves and      larger branches and make juice. I boiled and mashed the      clumps in small amounts of water, and then I hung the      pulp-twigs and all-in jelly bags . . . until all the      liquid dripped out.    </p>    <p>      Then, since an old childhood jump-rope jingle ("Elderberry      jelly, huckleberry pie. That's what we like, me oh MY!")      kept running through my head, I started making jelly. I      simply combined a cupful of elder berry juice with      two-thirds cup of honey and boiled down the mixture until      it sheeted. Lo and behold, I ended up with a tender, firm,      sweet-tart product that would have made my mother (the      cooking queen of my childhood's county fairs) proud!    </p>    <p>      That batch was a great success with my family and friends,      so I kept experimenting with the juice. I soon discovered      that elderberries are low in natural pectin and that if I      added some of the commercial gel-aiding substance, I could      get a lot more jelly for the same amount of work. Better      yet, I found that I could mix a naturally pectin-rich fruit      juice-like grape or green apple-with equal      parts of my elderberry drippings, to give my concoctions a      brand-new tangy flavor!    </p>    <p>      <strong>ELDERBERRY SLUMP</strong>    </p>    <p>      After stuffing my shelves with a variety of elder jellies,      I still had a kegful of juice . . . so I tied my apron back      on and created a juice-and-dumpling dessert: elderberry      slump. First I mixed together 2 cups of elderberry juice,      2/3 cup of honey, a sprinkle of cornstarch (for thickener),      and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice. I let that combination      simmer slowly in a pot while I started on the dumplings.    </p>    <p>      To fix these dough morsels, I measured out 1 cup of cake      flour (3/4 cup of bread flour and one tablespoon of      cornstarch could be substituted), 2 teaspoons of baking      powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I mixed these ingredients      and sifted them three times to make the dumplings light and      airy. Then I filled a 1/2-cup measure with one beaten egg      and milk, and stirred that liquid combination into the dry      "siftings" to make a stiff batter.    </p>    <p>      I dropped spoonfuls of the tasty paste into my simmering      elder juice and then cooked the dumplings-covered-for two      minutes on each side. The last step was to serve the      finished elderberry slump with whipped cream . . . and      watch the plates get scraped clean!    </p>    <p>      <strong>ELDERBERRY WINE</strong>    </p>    <p>      However, my whole family ate their fill of elderberry slump      . . . and I still had lots of juice! So I set out to brew      up a batch of that legendary inebriant: elderberry wine.      Unfortunately, my earlier vinting attempts had earned me      the title of "lil of winewrecker", but I figured the      possible reward would certainly be worth the effort, so I      altered a simple grape wine recipe that my parents had used      into my own formula for elderberry balloon wine.    </p>    <p>      I started off by sterilizing a gallon jug (to be sure that      no vinegar-making bacteria would subvert my efforts) and      combining-in this container-1 quart of      elderberry juice, 1/4 teaspoon of dry yeast, and 3 cups of      sugar. Then I filled the vessel with water and tied a big,      heavy balloon-as firmly as possible-over the      neck of the jug.    </p>    <p>      The readily made concoction frothed and bubbled wildly, and      the balloon became so inflated I thought it would burst.      But it held together somehow, and-amazingly      enough-when I took the air bag off six weeks later I      had a tart, scarlet berry wine . . . with no vinegar taste!    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROZEN CONCENTRATE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Since my pantry was nigh onto overflowing with elderberry      goodies by this time, I decided to freeze the rest of my      juice until midwinter .. . when the fruity liquid could be      used for special coldweather treats.    </p>    <p>      I did take measures to save space, though, by placing      blocks of frozen juice in cheesecloth and letting the      thawing product drip down into storage containers. The      elder fluid melted first (leaving the water content still      iced), and gave me a low-volume elderberry concentrate to      refreeze and put away!    </p>    <p>      <strong>FLOWERS, TOO</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      That September gave me an elderberry harvest I'll never      forget. However-as I learned the following      June-I had completely missed out on half of the      amazing plant's food products: the flowers!    </p>    <p>      The white-petaled clusters-called      "elderblow"-can be used to make tea . . . added to      muffins, pancakes, and custards . . . cooked up as fritters      (just dip an unshucked cluster in your favorite batter and      fry) . . . and more.    </p>    <p>      All in all, I bless the day my neighbor told me about      elderberries. I still wonder, however, how the generous      plant came by its name. Perhaps it's because the "elder"      berries ripen when the other wild fruits are pretty much      gone . . . or just because folks have known about the      source of good eating for so long. But one thing's for      sure: Since I keep on learning new culinary uses for the      delectable fruit and flow ers, elderberries will never get      old for me!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Marion has discov ered a great deal about      elderberry "eats", but she's right when she says there's      more to be learned! Here are some good leads for further      food and drink fixing ideas:    </p>    <p>      [1] As George E. Luther revealed in MOTHER NO. 59's      Down-Home Country Lore column, there is an easy way to pick      the ripe berries off all those twigs! Simply put a small      piece of 1/2" mesh hardware cloth over a bucket or large      bowl and rub the berry bunches across this screen. The      fruit will come off cleaner (and with less bruising) than      if you'd picked them all by hand!    </p>    <p>      [2] If you want to absorb some helpful knowledge about      other elderberry-and elderblow-wines, you'd do      well to read Sandra Oddo's "Feedback on Elderberries" in      MOTHER NO. 27, page 17 (see page 116 for information on how      to order back issues).    </p>    <p>      [3] And for more elderberry and flower      recipes-covering everything from cough syrup to      chutney to exquisite elder-sumac jelly-the best      resource just has to be that old forager's masterpiece:      Stalking the Wild Asparagus by Euell Gibbons (available      from your local bookstore or for $5.95 plus 95 cents      shipping and handling- from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.      Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791).    </p>
