                        <p>      <strong>A MATTER OF TIME</strong> <strong>:</strong> "The      home building industry is in the same situation that the      American automobile industry was in a couple of years ago:      making energy hogs and unable to sell them," says James      Barron, program manager of New York's Energy Research and      Development Authority. "Home builders are just lucky that      Japan doesn't export houses yet." Well, that "luck" may be      about to run out . . . read on!<br />      <br />      <strong>FOR THE PRICE OF</strong> <strong>AN AVERAGE      CAR,</strong> a Japanese "total solar energy package" will      soon be marketed in the U.S. It consists of a Rankine-cycle      turbine-powered by a solar collector-that will produce      electricity and provide heating and cooling. The basic      homeowner's model is expected to sell for about $2,500,      plus another $3,000 to $5,000 for solar energy storage      capability to provide power on sunless days.<br />      <br />      <strong>A SHADY OPERATION:</strong> Because of the area's      intense heat, many people in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia drive      when having to cover distances as short as 100 yards. In      order to encourage walking, and to achieve the      international standard of 12 square yards of greenery (and      shade) per individual citizen, the city has built a $4.2      million nursery . . . which should be capable of producing      the two million trees Jeddah plans to plant annually.<br />      <br />      <strong>NEED A SPEAKER ON SOLAR ENERGY?</strong> The Solar      Energy Research Institute (SERI) has compiled a roster of      270 lecturers, with expertise in solar and other renewable      energy topics, who have volunteered to address      organizations. To request profiles of speakers in your      area, call the Institute, toll free, at 800/525-5000 (if      you're calling from Colorado, dial 800/332-8339).<br />      <br />      <strong>"ELEPHANE" OR, MAYBE, "MELEPHANT"?</strong> The 600      cubic feet of elephant manure produced each day at the      Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus is now      processed through an anaerobic digester to produce methane      gas, which is then used to power generators.<br />      <br />      <strong>WE PREFER COMPOST:</strong> Kerr-McGee Nuclear      Corporation is treating 7.2 million gallons of radioactive      raffinate-generated annually at its Oklahoma Sequoyah      plant-with barium chloride . . . and is using the      treated waste, which has a high nitrogen content, as hay      fertilizer. Slaughtered cattle raised on the fodder were      recently given "a clean bill of health", and the company      eventually wants to sell the product commercially.<br />      <br />      <strong>ALCOHOL BROWNIES!</strong> A group of Montana farm      wives have been serving cookies, brownies, spice cakes, and      buns at county fairs . . . all made from leftover,      protein-rich alcohol-fuel mash. "We like to point out,"      they say, "that gasohol doesn't take food away from the      hungry world. 'Alcohol flour', which has three times the      protein of the original grain, can be exported at one-third      the cost."<br />      <br />      <strong>SOLAR SOLDIERS:</strong> The largest solar military      family housing project (it consists of 132 five-room      apartments) has been completed at Fort Stewart, Georgia at      a total cost of 1636,000 per unit . . . including site      preparation. Another 200 apartments equipped with solar      water heaters will be built this year, and sun-heated water      is already used at the base's dining facility.<br />      <br />      <strong>A SOLAR PRIVY</strong> that distills waste and      doesn't have to be cleaned out has been invented by      microbiologist William M. Tipton. Such outhouses will be      used in the Rocky Mountain National Park's high country,      where human waste was formerly removed (expensively) by      helicopter.<br />      <br />      <strong>OIL FROM THE SEEDS OF THE BUFFALO GOURD</strong> ,      a high-desert plant that's related to cucumbers and squash,      makes a very decent diesel fuel . . . and the vegetable is      now being selectively bred to increase its oil content.      Usually found in dry, poor soil, the vine will grow as much      as a foot a day when watered.<br />      <br />      <strong>WHAT TIMING!</strong> In MOTHER NO. 66 we told you      about a Chicago Amoco outlet with solar-powered pumps. What      we didn't know was that on the service station's dedication      day, a violent storm swept through town . . . knocked out      conventional power systems . . . and made the solar gas      station the only operating business in the vicinity!<br />      <br />      <strong>A MEXICAN-MADE, WOOD-FIRED WATER HEATER</strong>      provides Steve Bell of Anson, Maine (and his family of      five) with their monthly hot water . . . burning waste wood      from a local dowel factory. Information on the appliances      can be obtained by writing to Aqua Heater, Dept. TMEN, P.O.      Box 815, Clark, Colorado 80428.<br />      <br />      <strong>A GOLDEN THREAD:</strong> <strong>2,500 YEARS OF      SOLAR ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOLOGY</strong> by Ken Butti and      John Perlin (Cheshire Book/ Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.,      $15.95) points out that Socrates, Tiberius, Leonardo da      Vinci, and Napoleon III-among others-were solar advocates      .... From 1973 to 1977, the number of woodburning stoves in      the U.S. increased from 150,000 to 2,000,000, and the      renewable fuel now provides Americans with <strong>HALF AS      MUCH ENERGY AS DOES NUCLEAR POWER</strong> .... A new study      by two Cornell University scientists concludes that by the      mid-1980's, if the petroleum industry continues to increase      its search for new oil at the pace it has in recent years,      <strong>DRILLING WILL CONSUME MORE ENERGY THAN IT      UNEARTHS</strong> .... Some 20,000 Paris apartments are      being <strong>HEATED BY GEOTHERMAL HOT WATER,</strong> and      the number is expected to reach 800,000 by the end of the      next decade .... A Department of Energy study reveals that      the young solar industry- <strong>WITH EXPORTS      TOTALING $22.7 MILLION IN 1979</strong> -is more      active in exporting than is the average U.S. manufacturer.    </p>
