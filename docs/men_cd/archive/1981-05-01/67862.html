    <p>
                          <p>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to      the words "population", "resources", and "environment" in      the late 1960's. (They also coined the term coevolution,      and did a lot to make ecology the household word it is      today.) But while moat folks are aware of the Rhrlicha'      popular writing in the areas of ecology and overpopulation      (most of us- for instance-have read Paul's book      The Population Bomb) . . . far too few people have any idea      of how deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological      research (research of the type that tends to be published      only in technical journals and college textbooks). That's      why it pleases us to be able to present-on a regular      basis-the following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.    </p>    <p>      Whenever populations die out and species become extinct,      the most serious consequence is the loss of the ecosystem      services the creatures formerly helped provide . . . but      that's far from being the only serious repercussion of      extinction. Few people, for instance, are aware of the      enormous direct economic (and other) benefits Homo sapiens      derives from its living companions on this global      spaceship, and even fewer realize that the potential      benefits are greater still!    </p>    <h3>PLANT HEALERS</h3>    <p>      Many examples of the direct "pluses" that Earth's flora and      fauna provide us with can be found in the field of      medicine. In 1955, Paul's father died after a grim, 13-year      battle with Hodgkin's disease, a leukemia-like      disorder. Just after his death, Canadian scientists      discovered that an extract of the leaves of a periwinkle      plant from Madagascar caused a decrease in the white blood      cell count of rats. When chemists at Eli Lilly & Co.      analyzed the periwinkle's leaves, they discovered a large      number of alkaloids . . . poisonous compounds evolved by      the plant to fend off predators and parasites. (See our      column in MOTHER NO. 50 . . . to order back issues, turn to      page 116.)    </p>    <p>      Two of the alkaloids, vincristine and vinblastine, have      since proved effective in the treatment of Hodgkin's      disease. Indeed, with radiation combined with these and      other drugs, it's now usually possible to control-or      even cure-this kind of cancer. Thus a chemical that      was later found in a plant species could have greatly      prolonged Bill Ehrlich's life . . . and it's now available      to aid the 5,000 to 6,000 people, in the U.S. alone, who      contract this disease each year.    </p>    <p>      As one measure of the economic value of the discovery, the      world sales of vincristine, in 1979, totaled $35 million.      (The drug is also used to fight a variety of oth er cancers      . . . including several that afflict children and one form      of leukemia.) Had the periwinkle become extinct before the      1950's, of course, humankind would have suffered a great      loss . . . although no one would even have realized it.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, vincristine is just one example of the      contributions made by plants to human health. There is      evidence that Neanderthal people made medicinal use of      plants, and many "folk" or "herbal" remedies derived from      them are based not on superstition, but on the truly      efficacious chemicals that plants contain.    </p>    <p>      This fact will come as no, surprise, however, to folks who      remember that the Peruvian Indians long cured malaria with      an extract of the bark of Cinchona trees, which are members      of the coffee family. The substance's active ingredient,      quinine, became the main drug used against the      disease-worldwide-for a century. And even the antimalarials      now in use have molecules whose design was inspired by the      chemical structure of guinine.    </p>    <p>      Plants aid human beings-especially those in      industrial countries-in the battle against another      major group of killers, too: the diseases of the heart and      circulatory system. Reserpine, from Rauwolfia (a group of      plants related to the periwinkle), is widely used in the      control of high blood pressure. Digitalis (foxglove), a      member of the snapdragon family, is the source of a key      medicine used in the treatment of chronic heart failure.      (It stimulates the heart to pump blood more effectively      with a smaller expenditure of energy.)    </p>    <p>      Entire books have been written on the plant products human      beings use as medicines, and the examples given here barely      hint at the many anticancer drugs, painkillers, diuretics,      dysentery treatments, antiparasite compounds, dentifrice,,      ulcer cures, laxatives, and so on that Homo sapiens has      obtained from plants alone. In fact, chemicals from flora      are major-or sole-ingredients in about a quarter of all the      prescriptions written annually in the United States.    </p>         <h3>TINY MIRACLE-WORKERS</h3>     <p>      Perhaps even more dramatic are the contributions of the      lower plants and bacteria that have provided humanity with      antibiotics. (Antibiotics also have been found in higher      plants, and these may become an important future source of      medicine, but none is used medicinally yet.)    </p>    <p>      The impact on human health of this medical breakthrough can      hardly be appreciated by anyone born since World War II,      but the fears that-before that time-were      associated with a wide variety of injuries and diseases      have largely disappeared. War wounds and surgical      operations were much less likely to kill after antibiotics      became available to control bacterial infections. Scourges      such as bubonic plague, tuberculosis, epidemic typhus,      typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, bacterial      pneumonia, syphilis, and gonorrhea-the whole spectrum of      diseases caused by bacteria-could, with the discovery      of these "miracle" medicines, be treated more effectively.    </p>    <p>      It's astonishing that-in spite of all the already      known benefits-systematic investigations of the      medical usefulness of plant species have barely begun. For      example, conservationist Norman Myers estimates that only      about 2% of our world's quarter-million species      (approximately) of flowering plants have even been tested      for alkaloids . . . and no single plant species has yet      been thoroughly screened for all of its possible beneficial      effects.    </p>    <p>      If humanity is ever to take advantage of the potential      medical bonanza available in plants and micro-organisms,      heroic efforts must be made to maintain their diversity.      Even a species studied thoroughly today and declared      medically "useless" should be preserved against the      possibility that future generations will disagree with us      about that lack of value. After all, Penicillium notatum      -the source of penicillin-would have been "useless"      at the time of the American Civil War, because the role of      germs in causing disease was not then understood.      Therefore, when the species-rich tropical rain forests are      destroyed, both we and our descendants stand to lose many      untapped treasures . . . forever.    </p>        <h3>ANIMAL SURROGATES</h3>      <p>      The medical gifts that society has received from nature are      by no means restricted to plant chemicals. Substances of      animal origin have medical uses, as well. For example,      cytarabinederived from a sponge-is valuable in the      treatment of leukemia, and the venom of a Malayan pit viper      (a relative of the rattlesnake) is commonly employed as an      anticoagulant . . . an agent that prevents the formation of      blood clots, whichamong other things-can cause heart      attacks.    </p>    <p>      The major contribution of many species of animals, however,      has been their availability as tools for experimentation.      Rats, mice, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees (among others)      have been used in very large numbers as surrogates for      human beings . . . in a variety of medical experiments and      for the evaluations of numerous suspected toxins and      cancercausing agents. It's less well known that exotic      species of wild animals-such as elephants,      armadillos, and cottontop marmosets-often play      similar roles.    </p>    <p>      It is, of course, impossible to predict the animal species      that hold the greatest potential for rendering medical aid      to humanity. The promise of beneficial drugs from immobile      marine animals, which-like plants-have evolved      complicated chemical defenses, seems enormous. But there's      simply no way to know which animals will be in demand in      future laboratories. Again, the only sensible strategy is      to prevent extinctions wherever possible.    </p>     <h3>FUTURE FOOD SOURCES</h3>     <p>      The most important role of other species in supporting      humanity is as sources of food. Yet this area hasn't been      examined any more thoroughly than has that of medical      potential. For example, only about 3,000 kinds of plants      (about one percent of the total number of higher plant      species) have ever been utilized by people for food,      and-of those-only a paltry 150 or so have been      grown commercially to any extent.    </p>    <p>      This does not mean, however, that many of the currently      unexploited species couldn't provide badly needed      nourishment. Wheat, for instance, doesn't grow well in the      tropics, partly because the fungus-causing wheat rust      thrives in warm, humid climates and thus excludes one of      the three great cereal crops from some of the hungriest      parts of the world. But in those same regions, there are      many potential crops of known value and numerous other      plants that might help to feed humanity, but whose      potential for development remains untested.    </p>    <p>      As a single example, there's a plant group called      eelgrasses, which grow entirely under the sea and which      could become an important substitute for traditional grains      in densely populated seacoast regions. The Seri Indians of      Mexico's west coast have long made flour from the seeds of      one species. Here, then, is a potential crop that would      need no fresh water, fertilizer, or pesticides to be      successfully cultivated.    </p>    <p>      The plants that were the ancestors of wheat, barley, and      rye still grow in Israel. However, these unimpressive,      scruffy grasses show little sign of the potential that      selective breeding has brought to fruition. There's no      question that among the millions of populations and species      of plants now threatened with extinction are many      "Cinderella" equivalents to the forebears of today's major      crops . . . but they may be doomed to disappear without      ever getting to "the ball".    </p>    <p>      Even fewer animals have been domesticated than plants.      Virtually all of the domestic meat consumed by humanity      comes from just nine groups of livestock: cattle, pigs,      sheep, goats, water buffalo, chickens, ducks, geese, and      turkeys. Yet cattle, for example, are very unsatisfactory      domestic animals for the semiarid regions of Africa. They      don't thrive in the climate, and their need to trek long      distances to water leads to degradation of the land as well      as to eventual desertification.    </p>    <p>      It would be much more sensible to herd gazelles in such      regions, as the antelopes can take advantage of afar wider      range of native vegetation . . . can obtain water from      their food, and thus avoid having to travel to it . . . and      would cause less deterioration of the environment. There      are -of course-economic, social, and environmental problems      to solve before native animals can be herded on a large      scale in Africa . . . but unless the species of the area      are preserved, such options will disappear.    </p>       <h3>OTHER ESSENTIAL (AND POTENTIAL) PRODUCTS</h3>  <p>      Finally, consider some of the myriad other "gifts" that      human beings have received-or might      receive-from various species. Wood comes to mind      immediately. Many trees produce timber, but different      varieties produce lumber of rather different      characteristics. White pine wouldn't make good spars for an      airplane wing, and balsa wouldn't make a decent piano      sounding board. Even within a single species, different      populations may have diverse growth characteristics and      wood quality.    </p>    <p>      As you might imagine, there's been far too little      exploration into the potential of tropical trees, and many      species doubtless have as-yet-undiscovered desirable      properties. Furthermore, today's desirable quality may not      be yesterday's or tomorrow's. A few centuries ago, for      instance, British naval surveyors valued oaks with low,      spreading crowns from which they could obtain properly      shaped pieces for crucial parts of ships. Now, however,      that particular tree form is entirely wrong for most uses      of oak.    </p>    <p>      Other inedible products that humanity derives from plants      include natural rub ber (superior, in many applications, to      artificial types), tanning agents, dyes, fibers (such as      cotton, flax, and hemp), natural pesticides (such as      pyrethrum and rotenone), perfumes, lotions (witch hazel),      waxes, gums, cosmetics, meat tenderizers, preservatives,      gutta-percha (used for insulation and waterproofing),      turpentine, candles, soap substitutes, fertilizers, brooms,      and rattan furniture.    </p>    <p>      Then, too, many plants yield valuable oils. Those derived      from safflowers, soybeans, peanuts, and olives are used in      cooking. Linseed, soybean, and flax oils are ingredients in      paints and varnishes. And, in addition to its well-known      use as a laxative, castor oil is a fine lubricant of      machinery. Plant materials are also widely utilized in the      manufacture of products that range from plastics to      explosives.    </p>    <p>      Animals, too-although not nearly so rich a source of      goods as are plantssupply a wide range of products used in      commerce . . . including wool, shellac, musk, silk, down,      sperm oil, and leathers. Many of these have qualities that      are difficult (or impossible) to emulate with synthetics.    </p>    <p>      At the risk of sounding like a broken record, we must      reiterate that the potential for extracting useful products      from plants and animals seems barely to have been tapped.      For example, some tropical plant species produce an oil      that shows promise of providing a renewable source of a      low-sulfur petroleum substitute. With appropriate genetic      improvement, "gasoline farms" may someday supply a      significant fraction of our fuels.    </p>    <p>      Although this idea may seem strange at first glance, one      need only recall that all fossil fuels were originally      plant hydrocarbons. They were "processed" by geological      action-over millions of years-into coal, natural gas,      and oil. There's no theoretical reason why Homo sapiens      can't shortcircuit the plant- to- gasoline sequence by      starting with plants especially rich in hydrocarbons. . .      no reason except, of course, the possibility that the very      best plant sources may be unrecognized species and      populations that are being pushed toward extinction at this      very moment.    </p>    <p>      In other words, the destruction of Earth's flora and fauna      that's proceeding today may be, unbeknown to us, wiping out      species that hold secrets which might help to cure cancer,      feed the burgeoning human population, or solve the energy      crisis. The loss of these benefits alone would be a high      price to pay for our cavalier treatment of fellow living      beings.    </p>    <p>      For further information on direct benefits from other      species, see Extinction by Paul and Anne Ehrlich (Random      House, 1981, $15.95), upon which this column is based.    </p>
