                <p>      Take advantage of a lazy summer afternoon to make this      easy-to-build ladder.    </p>             <h5 id="byline">by   Glenn Jacobs</h5>   <p>      When I first moved my family to Poverty Flat, Arizona, we      had to convert the attic of our small house into two little      rooms for our children. After flooring and insulating the      area, however, I realized that the stairway provided the      only exit from either of the cubicles . . . and      that-should we have a fire-an alternate escape      route might well be needed.    </p>    <p>      At first I put together simple drop ladders made from      clothesline wire, but they were difficult to climb and      tended to tangle when used. However, my new fire escapes      (there's one outside of each bedroom, accessible by means      of a hinged window) are constructed from lengths of 1-1/2"      dowel, chain, and heavy steel wire. They can be hung under      the house's eaves when not in use, and dropped in half a      second . . . even by a sleepy youngster working in pitch      darknessl    </p>    <p>      And I haven't had any trouble getting the children to      practice using their escape routes, either. In      fact-even after three years "fire drill" is among      their favorite games!    </p>
