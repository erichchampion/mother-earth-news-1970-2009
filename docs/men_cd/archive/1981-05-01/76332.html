                    <p>      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville,      N.C. 28791    </p>    <p>      If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us (in about 500 words) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"you started your      venture. Because if your story can be fitted into an      upcoming installment of <strong>BOOTSTRAP      BUSINESSES,</strong> you'll receive [1] the warm      satisfaction of knowing that you helped someone else find      the happiness you enjoy and [2] a free two-year new or      renewal subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .    </p>    <p>      The article "A Small Discovery", in MOTHER NO. 49 (on page      97), started me thinking. If some folks just give away      refrigerators and other appliances they don't need, how      many people, I wondered, would allow a willing worker to      harvest hardwood timber from a field or pasture they wanted      cleared?    </p>    <p>      It cost me $1.00 (for an ad in a local paper) to satisfy my      curiosity . . . and was I ever satisfied! Eight people      called to say they'd like me to cut their trees for them,      and one fellow even offered to pay me for doing it.      However, the success of my ad left me with lots of      available free wood and two small problems . . . no chain      saw and no pickup. So I started calling the generous people      to ask them whether they [1] had a chain saw they weren't      using, [2] had or knew of a truck for sale at low cost, or      [3] needed any winter firewood for their own use.    </p>    <p>      It seems the Lord helps those who have the nerve to ask.      Five of the folks had fireplaces and needed wood. One man      offered me the use of his chain saw for two weeks in      exchange for a cord of firewood .. . three more agreed to      pay me $50 a cord to cut and split their own timber for      them . . . and, best of all, that fifth gentleman had a '59      Chevy Apache-in need of two tires and a      battery-which he gladly traded for two cords of wood.    </p>    <p>      I spent $45 to buy used tires and a battery from a junkyard      and got to work. The first three cords went to pay my      "debts" for the truck and chain saw. And now-after an      initial investment of less than $50 and a few weeks of work      have a pickup, a brand-new chain saw ($350), money in my      pocket ($150 to $200 a week), and a booming business. And      I've got plans for this spring too: I'm going to buy a good      tiller and go into the garden preparation business! How am      I doin', MOM?    </p>      <h3>M.A.Louisiana</h3>      <p>      Two years back, with Christmas rapidly approaching, our      budget was tighter than ever. I didn't have the cash      necessary to buy my husband the Stickler wood splitter we'd      seen advertised, so I did the reasonable thing . . . I set      to work looking through the pages of MOTHER for that      special home business that would make my purchase possible.      It wasn't long before I came across the excerpt from Ona      Evers' book Sparetime Dollars From the Kitchen, in MOTHER      NO. 51 (page 72). I read the article a number of times . .      . but, though the proposed business sounded easy enough, I      couldn't make up my mind about what to sell.    </p>    <p>      A short while later I decided to construct a Christmas      gingerbread house for my two preschoolers, and the only      recipes I found made five or six houses at a time . . .      which would be more than I had planned and more than my      children could eat. Nevertheless-figuring I could give the      extras away as presents-I went ahead and baked up a      batch.    </p>    <p>      Then MOTHER's article came to mind again . . . and I      decided to sell my surplus gingerbread creations. I took a      few of the confections to a local grocery and left them      there on consignment. My next stop was our small town's      bank, where I happened to mention my enterprise to the      teller. At her request, I showed her a house . . . and she      bought it, instantly. And that was only the beginning of my      good fortune . . . by the end of the day, that friendly      bank worker had gotten me 20 orders from other tellers at      the bank's main branch. As you can well imagine, I was      pretty clanged busy during the following weeks. I spent      less than a dollar per house and sold the spicy cakes for      $5.00 apiece, making enough money to buy that wood      splitter. . . and became determined to start baking earlier      the next year.    </p>    <p>      So, by Halloween of this past year, I was back letting that      same teller know I was ready to take orders again . . . for      two sizes: small houses for $3.50 and medium ones for      $7.00. I sold my kitchen handywork to folks at other      business places as well (typically, one person collects      orders for me from the rest of the firm's staff, then my      "agent" gets a free house in return for drumming up sales).    </p>    <p>      By the time last Christmas rolled around, I had made and      sold 78 small, 68 medium, and two large custom cake      dwellings. My expenses for gingerbread ingredients, cotton      batting and candy canes to decorate the houses, and plastic      wrap to protect them came to about $130, and my net profits      amounted to $600! The money I made from my enterprise      during its second year is now socked away in our building      fund.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Gloria Charbonneau</strong></em>      <em><strong>Gifford, Ont., Canada</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Last year my next-door neighbor graduated from college and      went to work as an electronics engineer . . . leaving      behind a pile of computers he had purchased at surplus      sales. (My friend had been making his spending money by      breaking up and selling scrap metal.) Well, I volunteered      to clean up that pile of junk and haul it away with my old      pickup.    </p>    <p>      I'd purchased the truck for $500 after reading Evan Green's      "I Pick Up Profits With a Pickup" in MOTHER NO. 32 (page      24), and it had regularly helped my wife and me earn about      $200 a month from hauling and odd jobs.    </p>    <p>      I initially just put the pile of computer rubble in the      side yard, planning to strip it for copper and aluminum      when I had some free time. But when 1 got a chance to look      at that rubbish more closely, I was in for a surprise . . .      all the contact points were plated with gold! I immediately      checked out some library books in order to learn how to      rescue the precious metal, and-after spending $50 or $60      for chemicals and test tubes-started my own "gold rush".    </p>    <p>      Since then I've made a practice of driving Old Dependable      around to surplus sales and buying up obsolete-but      not really useless-computers. Now, I'm earning between      $3.00 and $10.00 an hour scrounging gold, and what with the      other cash I garner with my pickup, my wife and I are      making it on our own! We're far from rich, but at least      we're eating.    </p>    <p>      If any of MOM's readers would like to share my method for      separating gold from plated parts (it works for plated      jewelry, too), just send me $2.00 (to cover printing and      mailing).    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>C.R. Highfill Dept. TMEN P.O. Box 6001 Los      Osos, Calif. 93402</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Catering to fashion-conscious customers in an alteration      shop five long days a week wasn't my idea of a good way to      earn a living in Aspen, Colorado. So, while holding that      job, I was constantly looking for a new-and more      pleasant-way of using my sewing skills and my time.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER came to the rescue with her article "it Pays to Be      an Old Sew and Sew" in issue 48 (page 64). After ruminating      on MOM's ideas for a few days, I made a couple of decisions      that turned earning a living into a pleasure instead of a      bore and burden: I decided to sew at home, and to work with      interior decorators . . . making custom pillows, dust      ruffles, bedspreads, comforter covers, tablecloths, and      other items.    </p>    <p>      To begin, I simply made a list of the decorators in the      Yellow Pages and visited them all . . . taking along      samples of my work, a price list, and my new business      cards. My initial investment was a mere $15 . . . $12 for      the cards and $3.00 for the printed "catalog". Orders      quickly started coming in, both from decorating firms and      from private customers whom the decorators had referred to      me.    </p>    <p>      As soon as I was self-employed, I realized that I could      arrange my own work schedule . . . and I've really used      that benefit to advantage. I sew four days a week from 8:00      a.m. to 3:00 p.m., with a lunch hour during which I enjoy      either running or cross-country skiing (according to the      weather). Once a week I go to town to pick up and deliver      orders, get supplies, do personal errands, visit friends,      and just plain have a nice time. 1 like working with      professional people, and I've been averaging $100 a week      doing what I choose, with almost no money invested. It      would be difficult to imagine a better way to work toward      self-sufficiency!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Maria Bachman Grand Valley, Colo.</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Reading THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>' can put just about anyone in      tune with his or her own talents or special abilities, and      help that person discover how to use those skills to bring      in cash and make life a little easier and more pleasant. I      know, because I would probably never have made my own      enterprise a success without MOM's inspiration.    </p>    <p>      After flood water ruined most of my family's tools and      supplies, I did something about my long-held dream of      painting a series of "homescapes" to exhibit at our small      town's banks. The three institutions I contacted all agreed      to let me display my paintings, and-although I was still      scared-I was suddenly in business. Then Gary Nelson's      article "Paint 'House Portraits' " in MOTHER NO. 62 (page      38) helped to further convince me that my plan would work!    </p>    <p>      My initial investment of about $35 covered supplies,      business cards, and posters. In a recent three-month      period, however, I also invested $75 in frames, oil paints,      and canvases ... but-in that same 12 weeks-I've      earned $300 in cash for my efforts. It isn't enough to pay      all the bills, of course, but it sure helps.    </p>    <p>      I'm doing all sorts of homescapes now, including one of our      daughter's apartment and one of our chickens' house. (Anna      Marie is really pleased with my "portrait" of her home,      while the hens don't seem to care one way or the other . .      . but do go right on laying.) Furthermore. I'm exhibiting      my work at a local shopping center this weekend ... and      smiling more than I have in a long while.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Mary Denney Valley Center, Kan</em></strong>    </p>
