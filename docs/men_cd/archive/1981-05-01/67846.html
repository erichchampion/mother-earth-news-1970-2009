                <p>      Getting rid of kitchen waste can be a simple, effective,      and inexpensive process, with...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Byron Brown</h5>         <p>      Even if you're not especially skilled at home projects, you      can make and install-in half a day-a garbage      disposal that uses no power . . . won't clog your septic      tank or drainage field . . . costs under $20 . . . and      turns out a useful product.    </p>    <p>      It seems our household always produces some kitchen waste      that we can't feed to the chickens, barn cats, or pigs. But      when we tried burying the "leftover leftovers" out in the      garden, some varmint would always dig them up . . . while      burn ing the garbage caused our oil-drum incinerator to      clog up.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, I recalled an article about composting that      I'd read back in the 40's. The piece had described a      homemade composter consisting of an 18"-diameter clay drain      tile, three-fourths buried in the ground, with a top and      bottom added. That article's author said he ran his      disposal on earthworms, but-since our animals consume      all of our scraps except for eggshells, citrus and banana      peels, and small bones-the useful wigglers haven't (yet!)      been lured into my version.    </p>    <p>      [EDITOR'S NOTE: You may be able to attract worms and speed      up the decaying process by layering your kitchen garbage      with an equal mix of freshly cut green , plants and chopped      dried leaves ... a handful of blood meal, available from      most .garden centers . .. and a thin coating of 'soil. And      sprinkle a little water over it occasionally.]    </p>    <p>      In practice, we have two tile composters. It takes about a      year to fill one, at which time we simply switch to the      other. Then, when the second one is full, the contents of      the first have decomposed into a rich humus and are ready      to be emptied on our garden plot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO BUILD IT</strong>    </p>        <p>      The initial step in constructing a homestead garbage      disposal is to locate an 18 "diameter clay drainage tile.      The units can be found at building supply yards where      bricks, cement blocks, and such are sold (if you plan to      put a brick bottom in your disposal, you can buy the      materials to do so at the same time).    </p>    <p>      Now, pick a well-drained spot for your composter and dig a      hole that's a few inches larger than you think is      necessary, since a big clay tile that "surprises" you by      getting stuck half in and half out of the earth can be very      difficult to handle. Next, lay the "groundwork", which can      be constructed of brick, cement, or steel (my base is made      from the top of an old 55-gallon drum), making sure that      it's level. And whatever material you use, do provide for      drainage, but keep the openings small ... bearing in mind      that a rat can get through a half-inch crack. When that's      accomplished, slide the tile into place and backfill around      it with dirt.    </p>        <p>      The disposal's top can be made from scrap lumber cut to      form two circles (see the accompanying diagram), which will      create a lid that fits snugly and won't blow away in gusty      winds. (It's best, however, not to make it so weighty that      taking out the garbage becomes a heavy chore!) If you don't      have a drawing compass capable of making the big circles,      find the center of a large-enough board . . . tap a nail      partway into the wood at that point . . . attach a string      to it . . . tie a pencil to the string's other end at the      proper distance (one-half the diameter of the circle being      drawn), scribe the shape . .. then use a saber saw or a      band saw to cut it out. Finally, center the smaller disk      upon the larger one . . . nail them together . . . paint      the cover . . . mount a screen-door handle on the lid . . .      and the job's done.    </p>    <p>      We've used our pair of units for three years now and are      quite pleased with them. The finished compost is dry,      crumbly, and odorless (it resembles peat mixed with      eggshells), and our plants just love it! What more could we      ask from a couple of holes in the ground?    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE.' In China, household garbage is used to      produce methane gas .
