                <p>      <strong>You can hold a "steady" job,</strong> <strong>and      maintain a homestead!</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Bob Aldridge</h5>        <p>      Working for the U.S. Postal Service-with its tightly      structured rules, regulations, and schedules-might      seem to be the most unlikely way possible to escape "the      system". But wait . . . part-time postal work could turn      out to be exactly the sort of I'm-still-my-own-boss      employment that you've been looking for! It requires no      investment or expensive training, nor any special skills      (other than common sense and a little physical dexterity)      .. . and you might even be able to choose the number of      days you'll work per week!    </p>    <p>      Naturally, such lenient qualifications aren't applicable to      all positions in the Postal Service, but they do apply to      my job: I'm a substitute rural carrier. In other words, I      deliver the mail when the regular postman or -woman is      sick, goes on vacation, or has a day off . . . events which      occur-on my route-about 50 times a year, or almost one day      a week. My schedule, then, provides some cash income plus      the time I need to get our farm going!    </p>    <p>      <strong>A FULL SCHEDULE</strong>    </p>    <p>      On the days that I work for Uncle Sam, I'm as busy as the      devil at a revival meeting! First, I get up at 4 a.m. to do      the daily chores that are too heavy for my wife and      children to handle . . . then I drive 27 miles into town,      arriving at the post office about 6 a.m. Right away, I pick      up my mail from the bins where most of it has already been      sorted, according to routes, by the clerks. (They've been      on the job since 2 a.m.!) My first task is to "case" the      letters by plac ing them-in the order that the mailboxes      come up on my circuit-in pigeon-holes in a seven-foot-tall      cabinet.    </p>    <p>      Getting the mail in order takes me anywhere from two to      three hours. When the chief clerk calls out "all up", I      collect the last batch for my route . . . case it . . . and      then-somewhere between 9:00 and 9:45-pull all the mail from      the cabinet and tie it into bundles so it will stay in      order while I'm out on the road.    </p>    <p>      Depending upon the size of the day's load, my deliveries      will require up to three hours to complete ... so I'm      almost always back at the post office shortly after 12:30.      There, I case up all the mail that arrived while I was out      on the route . . . and that's it for the day! No hassles,      no wasted time: I come in, do the work, and leave as soon      as it's finished.    </p>    <p>      And the pay isn't bad, either! Actually, the salary differs      slightly for each route, based on the mileage and the      number of mailboxes involved. For an average 40- to 50-mile      rural route, a regular carrier will earn about $18,000 a      year (plus overtime when the workload requires more than 40      hours a week), and part-time pay is proportionate to that      amount. When I include the mileage allowance for the use of      my car while delivering the mail, I figure I make the tidy      sum of between $60 and $70 per day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER BENEFITS</strong>    </p>    <p>      In addition to the extra cash and the flexible schedule      possible with part-time work, there are other-more      intangible-benefits in employment with the Postal Service.      Delivering the mail on a rural route is a great way to meet      some mighty interesting folks (not to mention the fact that      it provides an opportunity to enjoy the beautiful      countryside you'll likely pass through while making your      rounds).    </p>    <p>      By virtue of the job, the letter carrier seems to be      everyone's friend, too. Children regularly meet me to pick      up their family's mail . . . and older folks stop me to      chat about their newest grandchild. Furthermore, whenever a      gardening or a construction problem crops upon my own      homestead, I've got 400 "neighbors" to consult with. For      instance, if I want to know what to do about tomato blight,      I simply stop at the house, along my route, that has five      acres of healthy tomatoes out back!    </p>    <p>      There are also a few surprise "bonuses" that come with the      job: Just the other day one old man gave me a valuable      40-minute lesson in predicting the weather from natural      phenomena . . . while a retired gentleman who likes to bake      routinely leaves huge, fragrant loaves of bread in the box      for me.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SIGNING ON</strong>    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, getting a position as a part-time rural mail      carrier isn't as easy as is carrying out the duties once      you've got the job. Since the Postal Service is part of the      federal bureaucracy, its hiring process involves a good bit      of red tape.    </p>    <p>      First of all, every post office in the country maintains      its own register of qualified applicants ... and all      vacancies in the carrier lineup are filled from that list.      To have your name placed on a register, you must take a      special Civil Service written exam ... which is      administered only when the old list is exhausted (and that      could mean a long wait, depending on the turnover of      personnel in your area).    </p>    <p>      To further complicate matters, an aspiring mail carrier is      required to take the test at each post office where he or      she would like employment. (In addition, if you aren't      hired within a year, you'll have to complete the same exam      again!) Once a station's register is made up, consideration      for any available jobs is given in order of highest test      scores . . . and the top three candidates compete for each      opening. Then-when the existing roster is almost      exhausted-another testing session will be held and a      new ranking list drawn up from the test scores.    </p>    <p>      The system is generally without bias, although veterans do      have an edge over other candidates, since five points are      automatically added to their test scores. (Disabled      veterans receive an extra ten points.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, it's possible-but unlikelythat you could be in      the running many times and never hired. Actually, it's much      more probable that you'll be considered several times      before you're hired . . . and there's even a chance that      you'll land a job the first time you're interviewed!    </p>    <p>      So, if you want to break out of the fulltime employment rut      and bypass the system, why not do it by taking a job with      one of the oldest branches of the federal establishment?      Sure, it may sound paradoxical, but substitute postal work      offers extra cash, on-the-job freedom, and enough spare      time to pursue your own choice of lifestyle. All you have      to do is go back to the land . . . by mail!    </p>
