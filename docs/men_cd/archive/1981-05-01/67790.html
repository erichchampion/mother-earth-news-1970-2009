                <p>      <strong>What have you got when you need to cut a small      field of hay . . . weed a hard-to-get-at field. . . or      harvest a homestead grain crop?</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Harvey R. Gardner</h5>		     <p>      Up until about a century ago, virtually every small-scale      farmer knew how to handle a scythe. The hook-bladed      implements were used for cutting fields of hay, grain, and      weeds. But when the horsedrawn mowing machine-and,      later, the petroleum-powered harvester-became      popular, scythe usage dropped off sharply. In fact, today,      many folks consider the cutting method to be little more      than a "quaint folk art".    </p>    <p>      But hold your horses (and tractors) . . . because the      scythe is beginning to make a comeback, and with good      reason, too! More and more small-farm-holding folks are      discovering that the centuries-old implement is the perfect      tool for many homestead tasks. After all, a person wielding      one of the muscle-powered mowers can harvest an acre of hay      or grain a day (more, if he or she is skilled) . . . cut      weeds in small orchard plots and along fencerows . . . or      even-if the user is really adeptmow the front lawn!    </p>    <p>      Scythes are first-class cutters, butmake no      mistake-there's a knack and a good bit of hard work      involved in using them. I know . . . because I'm 74 years      young, and I've been around the implements since I was a      boy.    </p>    <p>      Back in those days, the first morning task, come haying      time, was to sharpen up the family scythe. Being a stout      lad, I was usually chosen to turn the handle of our      grindstone while my dad honed his blade to just the right      thickness and angle. The tool had to be precisely      sharpened-indeed, some special-purpose thin grass      scythes are honed until you can deflect the blade with a      thumbnail!-so this task always seemed to me to take hours      (actually, the job probably lasted little more than 15      minutes).    </p>    <p>      Dad would carefully run the blade up and down on the      grindstone, working on the underside of the tool to produce      an upwardcutting edge, and using an overthe-wheel drip      bucket to keep the metal cool. The scythe was considered      ready when the edge could cut, effortlessly, through a      wheat straw.    </p>    <p>      After my father gave the blade its final touches with a      whetstone, we headed off to the fields for the day's work.      Dad would start down in the left-hand corner of a plot,      adjust the two grips ( these "nibs" can be set to whatever      positions the mower desires) so that he could stand upright      while his blade hovered just off the ground,      and-keeping his feet close togetherturn his entire      torso back to the right. He would then swing the tool      around and across his body . . . so that the blade sliced      (not chopped!) a thin swath. After that, he'd arc the tool      back, step forward about half a foot, and slice again. Each      quarter-circle so cut would be about a yard across and only      six to eight inches deep.    </p>    <p>      My father would work for about 15 minutes at a stretch (      which was just long enough to cut a row in our small      field). At that point, he'd stop, pull his whetstone out of      its water-filled sheath, and retouch the blade. This      regularly performed task served two purposes: It kept a      fine cutting edge on the scythe, and it gave Dad a chance      to rest. (As I said, scything is hard work.)    </p>    <p>      Although my father used only a standard haying blade on his      scythe, I later learned that the tools' curved handles (or      "maths" as they're properly called) can be fitted with      sturdier bush blades for cleaning brush or briars, and with      thin imported grass blades for fine mowing work. In      addition, a grain cradle can be attached to a snath, to      catch the sliced stalks and make them easier to bundle than      they would be on the ground.    </p>    <p>      I didn't get to do much work with a scythe myself until I      got a job as a Montana ranch hand many years later. There I      used the tool to trim areas that a mechanical mower      couldn't reach. I found out-while doing so-that      it does take a while before a person can develop good      mowing and blade-sharpening ability. But I worked      hard at learning the skills . . .just as so many younger      people are doing today. And you know, it does my old heart      good to realize that there's a growing number of folks who      are concerned enough about the future to want to watch over      small plots of land . . . and that a tool from my childhood      days can still play a useful part in such people's lives!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Here are several sources for scythes.[1] By      Hand & Foot, Ltd., Dept.
