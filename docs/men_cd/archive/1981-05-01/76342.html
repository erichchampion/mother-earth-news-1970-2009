                    <p>      Spring has arrived, resplendent in all of its verdant      fullness, and the seasonal cornucopia of flower and      fragrance overflows. Fat, proud peonies perfume the lambent      air, the year's first fresh-picked peas delight the palate,      and-as soft night surrenders to day in the battle of      the hourswinter's desolate chill is forgotten in the joy of      life renewed.    </p>         <h3>GARDENER'S BOOKSHELF</h3>   <p>      With the apple trees already past blossoming in many parts      of North America, it's time to think ahead to that most      refreshing of beverages: cider. And Lew Nichols and E.A.      Proulx (the authors of "Tame Wild Apples and Berries" in      MOTHER NO. 68, page 110) have just published an exhaustive      study of the subject: Sweet and Hard Cider: Making It,      Using It, and Enjoying It (available for $9.95-plus      $1.00 shipping and handling-from Garden Way, Dept.      TMEN, 528 Ferry Road, Charlotte, Vermont 05445). The book      covers ev erything from home orchard care to the making of      six dif ferent ciders .    </p>          <h3>POP TO IT!</h3>    <p>      There's still time (again, in most parts of the country) to      tuck some popcorn seeds in an unused corner of the garden .      . . and MOTHER has found a merchant who's offering ten      different kinds of the explosive kernels! The Crockett Seed      Company-which has purchased a mail order seed      business formerly owned by that old-time supplier of      organic necessities, the Natural Development      Company-has varieties ranging from the relatively      early Strawberry corn (90 days) and White Hulless type (95      days) to the long-season Tiny Tender Black (120 days). Send      $1.00 (postpaid) for each packet (the firm's catalog is      free) to Crockett Send Company, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 237,      Metamora, Ohio 43540 . . . and get the popper ready!    </p>         <h3>INSTANT COMPOST</h3>          <p>      Though instantaneous decomposition may be a bit down the      road yet, we've come across some news (reported by R.M.      Carleton in the journal of the American Horticultural      Society, Dept. TMEN, Mount Vernon, Virginia 22121 . . .      membership $20) that's pretty exciting. It seems that a new      composting system has-in teststransformed shredded      matter comprising weeds, citrus peels, tomatoes, mangoes,      melons, a slightly decayed whole chicken, several      corrugated cartons, and (!) a pair of woolen trousers into      garden-ready compost with the consistency of ground.      up, moist tobacco in only eight days! The technique, which      was invented by a Canadian, Jack Warrington, employs a      "bin" made of felted plastic material that provides      excellent control of heat, moisture, and air. The required      containers, and a special shredding blade for use on rotary      mowers, will be marketed some time this year . . . and      MOTHER will do her darnedest to rush test results to you.    </p>      <h3>A DIRTY AND THIRSTY LAND</h3>          <p>      In many parts of the country, last autumn was so dry that,      by December, the word "drought" began to be heard. And in      January-which had the least rainfall ever recorded      during that month in the Northeast-big cities' water      supplies had dropped perilously close to the crisis level.      Worse still, many meteorologists began predicting that the      next two decades-right to the end of the centurywould be      marked by much less rainfall than normal. For the thousands      of gardeners who have been able to rely-without much      thought- on nature for ample supplies of moisture,      there was a whole new set of problems to face.    </p>    <p>      Well, with the spring some rainfall came . . . and the      water levels in many reservoirs rose. But wise gardeners      are aware that the promise of spring sometimes withers in      summer's heat ... and that precautions against the      possibility of a longlasting dry spell should be taken.      MOTHER has come up with a fivepoint program that should      help your garden make it through all but the worst of      droughts.    </p>    <p>      The first step-although it may be too late for you to      take action on it this season-is to increase the      water-holding capability (known as field capacity) of your      garden itself ... by incorporating all of the organic      matter that you can into the soil.    </p>    <p>      The second step is to preserve vital moisture by making      extensive use of mulch. You'll find a number of good      suggestions on mulching in Stu Campbell's The Mulch Book      (Garden Way, 1973) . . . which is available at bookstores      or-for $3.95 plus 952 shipping and      handling-from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791.    </p>    <p>      The third step is to make maximum use of the water that      does fall. Set rain barrels under your downspouts to      harvest the runoff from your roof. Buy a small pump      attachment for your 1/4" drill and reclaim the rinse      cycle's "gray water" from your washing machine. Certain      precautions must be observed when you employ gray water,      and there's an excellent discussion of the subject in the      Farallones Institute's book The Integral Urban House      (Sierra Club Books, 1979, $12.95 at bookstores . . . or      from Mother's Bookshelf for the list price plus 95 cents      shipping and handling).    </p>    <p>      The <em>fourth</em> step involves insuring that whatever      moisture you have available gets to your garden in as      efficient a manner as possible. Oscillating sprinklers may      be fine in ordinary times, but such devices cause an      enormous amount of water to be lost to evaporation. Since      your vegetable garden needs an inch of water a week in the      summer, you'll conserve the precious liquid best by putting      it where it will do the most good: right above the roots.      If you hand-water, try using a soaker hose. The Super      Soaker sold by Domestic Growers Supply (Dept. TMEN, P.O.      Box 809, Cave Junction, Oregon 97523, catalog $1.00      refundable) is made of materials recycled from old tires,      and it's a good one.    </p>    <p>      After you've done everything possible to bring what water      there is to soil that's well prepared to receive and retain      it, there's a fifth step: Plant drought-resistant      varieties. Cleopatra broccoli, for example, tolerates dry      weather better than any other type ... while lochief Hybrid      corn is known for its performance under parched conditions.    </p>
