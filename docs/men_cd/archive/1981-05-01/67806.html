                <p>      Adopting A more healthful diet isn't always especially when      there youngsters in the family. However, you can make the      transition more gradual if you prepare some...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Helen Brassel</h5>		         <p>      Although recent studies have attempted to prove that "fast      foods" can occasionally provide nutritious substitutes for      home-cooked meals, it's a fact that-regardless of the      synthetic vitamins that are sometimes packed into the      commercial products the "convenience" meals are likely      injected with any number of not-so-healthful chemical      additives and preservatives. Unfortunately, a good many      folks (especially young'uns) have been literally brought up      on such fare and have an acquired taste for it (even if      their families have since "converted" to unprocessed food      diets).    </p>    <p>      However, you can wean your children (or yourself) from such      "junk foods" as readymade burgers, fries, and tacos by      simply preparing some nutritious "fast food" . . . right in      your own kitchen. The homemade goodies will be crammed with      nutrition, they'll cost less than the storebought      varieties, and-best of all-you'll know exactly      what goes into them.    </p>    <p>      I started experimenting with "alternative" fast food when I      decided to put our hyperactive son on a diet that allowed      no white sugar, no preservatives, and no food coloring. To      vary the boy's meals and satisfy his longings for the      "standards" he loves (but which contain the very chemicals      that seem to trigger spells of bad behavior), I devised      several recipes, based on nutritious whole foods, that      wouldn't aggravate his condition. Now he can down one of my      homemade "Big Macs" (and all the trimmings) without      suffering any ill effects . . . and, as a bonus, our whole      family is able to resist "the lure of the Golden Arches".    </p>    <p>      <strong>NON-HAMBURGERS<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      You may be surprised to know that burgers don't have to be      made of good old U.S. Grade A char-broiled beef to satisfy      a hearty appetite. In fact, you can whip up delicious      patties from soybeans. The protein-packed beans can be used      either cooked or sprouted to make a burger filling that      should appeal to the most confirmed fast-food fanatic.    </p>    <p>      Soybeans do take a long time to cook, but they don't need      much tending to. Simply soak 1 cup of the legumes,      overnight, in enough water to cover them. On the following      morning, cover the pan and boil the beans (in the same      water) for about three hours. After they're cooked and      thoroughly tender, let the "beef to be" cool down a bit . .      . then drain off whatever water is left (save it for your      soup pot), mash the beans, and mix in about 1/2 cup of      uncooked oats. Flatten the mixture into thick patties (the      recipe will produce four to six, depending on size) and the      burgers will be ready to fry in a tablespoon or two of hot      oil.    </p>    <p>      You can also make sprouted burgers (which offer even more      nutrients than do those made with ungerminated beans, since      the shoots are bursting with vitamins and minerals) by      first sprouting 1/2 cup of soybeans together with 1 cup of      pinto beans. After 3 or 4 days, simmer them in water (to      cover) until they're tender (it'll take about 15 minutes).      Then chop up the cooked sprouted beans and combine them      with 2 eggs, 1/4 cup of milk, and 1-1/2 cups of bread      crumbs. Shape the mixture into four or five patties, roll      each one in whole wheat flour, and fry them in vegetable      oil.    </p>    <p>      As still another nutritious alternative, you might like to      fix rice and vegetable burgers. To do so, simply combine 3      cups of cooked brown rice (see the instructions in the      recipe for taco filling that follows), 3 grated carrots,      half a bunch of chopped parsley, 1 large minced onion, 1      clove of garlic (crushed), 1 egg, and 1/2 cup of whole      wheat flour . . . and stir the mixture well. Season the      fixin's to taste, form the patties (this recipe, too,      should produce four or five burgers), and brown each of      them on both sides.    </p>    <p>      Of course, once you've created your delicious and healthful      sandwich fillers, you certainly won't want to serve them on      any old bread . . . so here's how to make your own whole      wheat hamburger buns. First, dissolve 2 tablespoons of      active dry yeast in 1/2 cup of lukewarm water. Stir in 1      tablespoon of honey, and set the liquid aside. Then, in a      medium saucepan, scald 1 cup of milk and let it cool to a      lukewarm temperature before adding 1/3 cup of oil, 1/3 cup      of raw sugar, and 2 teaspoons of sea salt. Stir the mix      into the softened yeast. Next, beat in 2 eggs and enough      whole wheat flour to make a nice soft dough (you'll      probably need about 4 or 4-1/2 cups). When all the      ingredients are well blended, cover the bowl before      refrigerating it overnight.    </p>    <p>      Two hours prior to the following day's dinnertime, remove      the bowl from the icebox . . . and let it stand at room      temperature for 30 minutes. Then knead the dough for a      short while (until it becomes fairly elastic) and pinch off      pieces about the size of a large chicken egg. Flatten each      one into a round bun shape and place it on a greased cookie      sheet to rise for about half an hour. (If you want to make      the buns look really authentic, brush the top of each one      with a little egg white, and sprinkle the "painted" area      with sesame seeds.) Bake the bread at 375Â°F for 15 to      20 minutes . . . and you'll end up with two dozen      scrumptious rolls.    </p>    <p>      When you're ready to serve your soybean or vegetable      burgers, split the buns open and spread them with a mixture      of 1/2 cup of real mayonnaise, 1/4 cup of prepared mustard,      and 1/4 cup of ketchup. (If you want to avoid sugar-which      is often a prominent ingredient in these condimentsyou can      find honey-based brands at almost any health food store.)      Finally, slap a homemade patty on each bun, top the burger      with a slab of cheese, an onion ring or two, a tomato      slice, several pickle strips, and some shredded lettuce . .      . and succumb to a Big Mac attack, naturally!    </p>    <p>      <strong>TACOS WITH A DIFFERENCE<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      A lot of folks in the southwestern states patronize their      local taco stands as often as-if not more frequently      than!-they visit hamburger restaurants. If you're a      fan of Mexican food, you'll be glad to know that you can      easily produce south-of-the-border delicacies with your own      fresh (and often homegrown) ingredients. A nutritious      filling for make-'em-yourself tacos starts with well-cooked      brown rice.    </p>    <p>      The secret of getting the little kernels to come out nice      and tender (rather than hard as pebbles) is patience!      First, bring 2 cups of water to a full boil, and then      gradually pour in 1 cup of unwashed brown rice. (Be sure to      do this so slowly that the liquid never stops boiling.)      Lower the heat, cover the pot tightly, and let the rice      cook for about 45 minutes . . . or until all the water is      absorbed by the grains.    </p>    <p>      While the rice is simmering, fry up a combination of about      1 cup each of finely chopped onions and green peppers. (If      your tastes run to really spicy foods, you may also want to      add cayenne peppersor even the still hotter      jalapenos-to taste.) Then stir those vegetables into      the finished grain, along with a cup of cooked pinto beans.      (The legumes will combine with the rice to create a      complete protein.) With that done, throw in your      seasonings: 1 crushed clove of garlic, 1 tablespoon of      chili powder, 1 teaspoon of cumin, and a dash of salt. Stir      this mixtureover low heat-for about five minutes, and      then pile it into taco shells.    </p>    <p>      If you don't want to use the commercially packaged      tortillas, you can make your own "Mexican sandwich bread",      too ... preparing either a traditional maize flavor or a      wheatbased variation. To make a batch of 18 corn tortillas,      mix-in a large bowl-2 eggs, 2-1/2 cups of water, 1 cup of      unbleached white flour, 1 cup of yellow cornmeal, and 1/2      teaspoon of salt. Drop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle      to form five-inch "pancakes". Fry the circles for about two      minutes-without turning them over-and then set      them out to dry on racks. While the tortillas are still      soft, fold each one in half . . . keep it closed with a      pair of tongs . . . and fry it in four cups of hot oil for      five minutes or until it holds its shape.    </p>    <p>      To prepare wheat taco shells, first mix together two cups      of whole wheat flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Then stir in      from 3/4 to 1 cup of water (use just enough to make a stiff      dough). Knead the mound until it's smooth, then break it      into one-inch balls (this recipe also makes about 18      tortillas) and roll each one into a large, thin sheet. Cook      them on a greased griddle over low heat, turning each piece      once or twice. Then, after folding them with tongs, fry the      whole wheat tortillas in bubbling oil until they're firm.      The process will take several minutes.    </p>    <p>      After the folded shells have become dry and crispy, spoon      in your bean-and-rice stuffing . . . and top it off with      shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.      Finally, pour taco sauce over the filling. (You can, as you      probably have guessed, make your own spicy condiment:      Simmer together 2 cups of tomato sauce, one tablespoon of      honey, 2 teaspoons of chili powder, 2 teaspoons of garlic      powder, 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and, again,      hot peppers if you prefer fiery foods.) Ladle the hot sauce      over the contents of your homemade tacos, and you'll have      some of the best eating this side of Baja!    </p>    <p>      <strong>NOW THAT'S ITALIAN!<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Submarines, hoagies, grinders, heroes, or poor boys:      Whatever you call them, the long sandwiches are all pretty      much alike. They're tasty, sure . . . but they are rather      heavy on the sodium nitrate and other preservatives. Well,      even confirmed carnivores can solve that dilemma (and still      have meat in their subs) by making fresh cold cuts      themselves!    </p>    <p>      Mix together 2-1/2 pounds of freshly ground hamburger,      1-1/2 cups of crushed cracker crumbs, 3 beaten eggs, 1/3      cup of heavy cream, 1 large grated onion, 1-1/2 tablespoons      of salt, 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg and pepper, and 1/4      teaspoon each of thyme and allspice. (You can, of course,      use other spices, peppers, or chopped olives, cheese. etc.      to produce a variety of flavors.) When the mixture is well      blended, divide it in half and shape each "blob" into a      long, firm roll.    </p>    <p>      Then-on a large sheet of wax paperlay out half a      pound of home-smoked (if you can get it) bacon slices . . .      being sure their edges overlap. Place one of the meat rolls      on top of the bacon, and then wrap the slices around the      cylinder. Peel the paper away, and wrap the entire      "sausage" in aluminum foil (twisting the ends tightly      shut). Prepare the other roll of beef in the same way, and      bake them both at 350Â°F for 1-1/2 hours. When you      remove the packages from the oven, place them in a pan and      punch several holes in the side of each wrapper to let any      accumulated fat drain out. Then chill the rounds andwhen      you're ready to put together a hero, hoagie, or      submarine-just unwrap and slice your custom-made cold      cuts.    </p>    <p>      To make long Italian bread for your sandwiches, first      dissolve 1-1/2 packages of active dry yeast in two cups of      warm water. Add a tablespoon of salt, another of raw sugar      or honey, and five cups of unbleached white flour. Knead      this mixture for about five minutes . . . then put it in a      greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for 1-1/2 hours.      When the dough has doubled its bulk (more or less), punch      the mass down and shape it into two long, skinny loaves.      Place the bread on a cookie sheet, slash the top of each      loaf, and brush them both lightly with a mixture of 1 egg      white and 1 tablespoon of water . . . then put the bread in      a cold oven, turn the temperature to 400Â°F, and bake it      for 30 to 40 minutes.    </p>    <p>      When the crusts are golden brown on top, remove the pan      from the oven ... slice each loaf in half lengthwise . . .      and let your "customers" build their own creations with      layers of cold cuts, provolone cheese, sliced tomato, dill      pickle, shredded onion, green pepper, etc. Season the      sandwiches with salt and pepper . . . then drizzle a      dressing-made from 1/2 cup of oil, 3 tablespoons of      vinegar, and 1/2 teaspoon of oregano-over the      filling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENTUCKY "SLY" CHICKEN<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      You can provide the Colonel with some competition by trying      this homemade imitation of his secret recipe. First, cut up      a whole chicken and dip the frying parts into a mixture of      one egg and 1/2 cup of milk. Then, roll each piece in a      combination of 1 cup of flour, 1/4 cup of cornmeal, 1/2      teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder,      1/4 teaspoon of paprika, 1/4 teaspoon of basil, and a dash      of salt and pepper. Deep-fry the coated parts for 20 to 30      minutes. Next, arrange them on racks placed over a roasting      pan full of boiling water. Let the whole thing steam in a      warm oven for 10 or 15 minutes, then let your hungry family      go at a platter of crispy, golden-fried chicken . . . just      like the "real thing".    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE TRIMMINGS<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Fast-food cookery doesn't end with the main course,      however. You can also produce a batch of delicious homemade      French fries or fruit pies . . . similar to the ones sold      in some convenience restaurants. To make up a few orders of      shoestrings, wash several large potatoes (use one for each      person) . . . and chop them into long, thin strips. (You      can peel the potatoes before cutting them, but the fries      will taste better-and provide more fiber and      nutrients-if you cook them up in their skins.) Toss      the raw spuds briefly in vegetable oil, and spread them      over an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake them at 425Â°F for      10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 350Â°F for      another 20 or 30 minutes. When the fries turn crispy and      golden brown, sprinkle on sea salt and serve them with lots      of ketchup!    </p>    <p>      Another fast-food favorite is the hot apple turnover, and      you can make a wholesome version of that dessert with just      about any honey-sweetened fruit. First, make enough      dough-using a standard whole wheat pastry      recipe-for a doublecrust pie, roll it out to a      thickness of 1/8 inch, and cut the sheet into small squares      (depending on the size you prefer, you can probably make 8      or 10 from a single batch of dough). Pile sweetened fruit      on half of the rectangles, sprinkle a little cinnamon on      top, and then cover each one with another piece of pastry.      Seal each minipie's edges by pressing its seams together      with a fork, and prick a few air holes in the top. Fry the      fruit tarts in deep hot oil for about three minutes, then      let them drain and cool slightly. Be sure to serve them up      while they're nice and warm, but be careful...the spicy      innards will be hot!    </p>    <p>      From the recipes I've presented here, you can see that      there's no need to run down to the local fast-food eatery      (where what you get usually amounts to an overpriced dose      of chemicals) every time the urge for a little edible      self-indulgence hits. You can satisfy your cravings with      better eats at home . . . spending a lot less money and      swallowing fewer "mystery" additives. So the next time      someone in your household comes down with a case of the      munchies, don't take off for the nearest burger, chicken,      or taco stand . . . head for your own kitchen instead!    </p>
