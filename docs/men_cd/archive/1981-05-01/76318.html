    <p>
                    <p>      As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.    </p>    <p>      Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over again.    </p>    <p>      And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably Productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.    </p>    <p>      Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings hare      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>"', P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonaille, N.C. 28791. And Please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we all can read what      the Nearings have to say.    </p>          <p>      I have a root cellar and use it to store apples, turnips,      potatoes, and onions. However, although my food room seems      to stay dry, I feel that an unacceptable percentage of the      put-up produce rots before I can use it. Have you had any      experience with root cellaring that might help me figure      out what my problem could be?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Our root cellar is directly underneath the kitchen.      It's lined with cement, and has drains built into its      floor. We store apples, rutabagas, potatoes, carrots,      onions, and turnips in wooden crates, in boxes, or in      baskets . . . and put dry autumn leaves between the layers      of produce. Using this technique, we've been able to keep      spoilage down. However, when food is stored in such a      manner, it's best to go through the boxes every month or      two ... to eliminate any fruits or vegetables that show      signs of spoiling,</strong> <strong>before they can      "contaminate" their neighbors.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Do you believe in the possibility of a worldwide utopia?    </p>    <p>      <strong>The term "utopia"-as it's ordinarily      used-refers to a form of social organization which is      flawless and, therefore, cannot be improved upon. We don't      believe in such a thing. We do, however, have definite      ideas with regard to a workable, worldwide society that      supersedes nationalism.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Scott has elaborated on the subject of "worldism"      in his book United World, published in 1945. We still have      some paperbound copies of the volume, which can be      purchased-for $2.50-from the Social Science      Institute, Dept. TMEN, Harborside, Maine 04642. The same      subject is approached in a different manner in Scott's      latest book, Civilization and Beyond, which costs $4.50      from the same address. (Please enclose 50$ postage per      book.)</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'm interested in any comments either of you may have on      the personal commitment of marriage. I've been married      almost 14 years now, and I'm still occasionally in wonder      at the dynamics of the relationship.    </p>    <p>      <strong>No marriage is perfect, but some are better than      others. We've been living to</strong> <strong>gether for      close to half a century, and while we have quite different      characters and interests, as well as different ideas on      many subjects, we still get along and still are      together.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We believe that sharing interests is essential for      close comradeship. Walter Lippman has said, in A Preface to      Morals, "The emotion of love, in spite of the romantics, is      not self-sustaining; it endures only when the lovers love      many things together, and not merely each other."</strong>    </p>    <p>      It was a pleasure seeing you at the First Homesteaders      Festival in 1978, and we'd like to see you again. Will you      be making some public appearances this summer?    </p>    <p>      <strong>We enjoyed the First Homesteaders Festival held in      1978 near Elmira, New York. A young couple, Sherrie and      Norm Lee, are holding the</strong> <strong>Fourth Annual      Festival at their homestead during the weekend of July      23-25 this year. Write to them for information (at Dept.      TMEN, RR 2, Box 151, Addison, New York 14801 . . .      enclosing 20 cents for mailing costs) if you're interested      in attending or in receiving a sample copy of their      Homesteaders News.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We, however, have said "no" to all "appearances"      this year (after all, with 175 combined years of joint      activity behind us, we feel entitled to a rest), but we've      added that "maybe we'll drop in" to Sherrie and Norm's      affair and/or to the Bread and Puppet Circus in Glover,      Vermont on August 15 and 16, 1981.</strong>    </p>    <p>      My grandmother, who was a good "natural foods" cook, died      when my grandfather was 70 years old. At that time, he      looked like a man of 60. Now, five years later, he looks to      be 100! I'm sure he's suffering from malnutrition, due to a      diet of medicine and the poor food frequently served in      hospitals and nursing homes. But how do you tell a      75-year-old man that he has to change his ways and listen      more to himself than to his doctors?    </p>    <p>      <strong>At 75, your grandfather should be mature enough to      know how to take care of himself . . . unless his wife      babied him through the years. If so, it's partly her fault      for not having educated him in good nutrition or let him do      his share.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tell him to eat as much raw food as he can chew.      Make sure that half of his diet is composed of uncooked      edibles, and have him eat such foods first . . . before he      fills up with the heavier, prepared part of the meal.      Suggest that he have fruit for breakfast and lunch, and a      big salad first thing for supper. If the hospital or      nursing home won't furnish these, he should provide them      himself (or perhaps you could go shopping for      him):</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>It would be difficult for Scott, in his nineties,      to get along without a helping hand from Helen . . . and it      would not be easy for her, in her seventies, to get by      without him. We plan to preserve good health as long as      possible, and-if we're lucky-to go      together.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Can you tell me what mulch materials you've had the most      success with?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Most of our mulching is done with autumn leaves,      spoiled hay, and seaweed. Good mulch, as you may know, must      be both loose and light.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We don't mulch open areas in our fall garden until      a good frost has crusted the ground. This practice, we      feel, prevents slugs and mice from using our plant      protection as a comfortable winter hiding place!</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'm very interested in your "anti-cooking" book. Is it      available yet? And, if so, how can I get a copy?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Send a stamped, addressed envelope to the Social      Science Institute (at the address already given) for      details.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I've just finished reading Continuing the Good Life and      found it very intellectually nourishing. I was, however,      uncertain as to the meaning of the phrases at the top of      page 184: ". . . only many lives ahead will give us time .      . . to fulfill all we hope to do." Is this a reference to      reincarnation?    </p>    <p>      <strong>The passage was not intended as a reference to      reincarnation so much as to the continuity of life. Without      going into the question of whether reincarnation does occur      (there has been much evidence indicating so, and little      supporting the belief that it does not), we take it for      granted that something of the beings which we are survives      death, and goes on with whatever may lie ahead.</strong>    </p>
