                <p>      Innovative livestock owners are beginning to discover that      the animals native to a given area are often hardier and      more productive than are "modern" breeds.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by        Randy Kidd    </h5>		    <p>      <em>"A cold wind blew across the prairie when the last      buffalo fell . . . a deathwind for my people,"</em> said      Chief Sitting Bull. And, indeed, the buffalo's near      extinction ranks as one of American history's most shameful      tales.    </p>    <p>      There was a time when the powerful beasts ranged from      Virginia to California . . . from Canada to Florida . . .      and down into Mexico. In fact, it's been (conservatively)      estimated that when Europeans first arrived on these      shores, there were over 60 million bison-as they're      properly called-in existence . . . amounting to      probably the greatest aggregation of large animals ever      known to civilized Homo sapiens. Even as recently as the      last century, a herd could contain a million individuals,      so that "the country was one robe" and "the plains were      black and appeared as if in motion".    </p>    <p>      However, as men and women from the eastern cities moved      westward, the situation changed dramatically. The worst of      such people wantonly butchered the marvelous creatures,      taking just the hidesor sometimes only tongues-and      leaving the carcasses to rot until the      bone-harvesters could collect their share. Few people      realize that this senseless slaughter caused much of the      hostility that the Plains Indians-many of whom relied      upon the bison for food, shelter, and morecame to feel      toward the settlers!    </p>    <p>      By 1890, only a few small herds remained. More recently,      however, as a result of the efforts of conservationists and      ranchers who recognized the animals' value, buffaloes once      again began to dot the American countryside. Today, there      are an estimated 30,000 head-divided among about 400      herds-in the U.S. and Canada. (Although a couple of      the groups number over 1,000, most are much smaller.)      What's more, bison are, when properly raised, proving to be      both enjoyable and highly profitable livestock animals!    </p>    <p>      <strong>A HARDY BREED</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      The buffalo has one distinct advantage over most domestic      cattle . . . its incredible hardiness. With a rough hide      and thick covering of woollike hair, a bison (even when      very young) can easily tolerate the harsh, frigid winters      of the upper prairie states . . . and can weather blizzards      that would likely kill entire herds of beef animals.    </p>    <p>      Thriving on grasses alone, the native livestock can range      and forage far and wide, and even root out food from      beneath deep snow. In fact, some commercial buffalo herds      are simply left to forage year ground, although most are      fed a little hay during the cold months. (Our Kansas Fish      ,and Game Department's herd is given 1-1/2 pounds of 18%      protein pellets, per animal, throughout the winter . . .      and supplemental hay when there's a ground cover of snow.)    </p>    <p>      In addition to being thrifty to feed, the beasts are      relatively disease-free. A few cases of brucellosis,      however, have recently been reported in bison herds,      and-since the disease can affect humans and cattle,      as well as other domestic animals-it's an illness      that every potential buffalo buyer needs to be wary of.      Some folks say that bison tend to develop their own      resistance to brucellosis, and in states where they're      still considered wild animals, testing for the disease      isn't required. But for your own safety and that of all      your barnyard critters, I'd recommend that, when purchasing      a buffalo, you buy only one that's had a recent negative      brucellosis blood test performed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOR WHAT THEY'RE WORTH<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Since bison have thrived for thousands of years without      human help, it's a pretty safe bet that the animals won't      need much from you . . . and-in return for the little      care it will require-your herd will reward you in a      number of ways. Buffalo meat, for example, is delicious,      relatively fat-free, and highly marketable .. . the hides      can be used for anything from robes to tipis . . . bison      "wool" can be spun and woven into garments . . . the      creatures' mounted heads are considered valuable by some      folks . . . and, if a bison rancher were to follow the      example set by the Plains Indians of 200 years ago, he or      she could probably learn how to utilize the sinews,      bladders, "buffalo chips", and almost every other part of      the animals that were once known as "the Indians'      commissary".    </p>    <p>      Buffalo meat is the major source of income from a      commercial bison herd. A mature cow will weigh about 800 to      1,200 pounds, while a large bull can tip the scales at more      than a ton and stand six feet tall at the shoulder. Of this      poundage, 40 to 50% will be usable meat (it works out to      about the same dressing percentage as a steer) and can      provide virtually the same cuts you expect of beefsteaks,      roasts, ground meat, etc.-or be made into summer      sausage and jerky. Bison tastes very similar to lean beef .      . . and the key word here is lean! Buffalo steaks, you see,      average less than 10% fat (one study reports only 4% for      range-fed buffa lo) ... as compared to beef, which will      contain from 20 to 40% fat. Bisonburgers are, therefore,      valuable in weight-and cholesterol-watchers'      diets, and-for just that reason-a number of      hospital kitchens now serve buffalo instead of beef.    </p>    <p>      The animals' hides are also valuable, since bison leather      is stronger and more pliable than that from cattle, and is      in demand for any job where superior material is needed. A      tanned "prime" specimen will bring about $10 per square      foot ... which works out to between $200 and $500 per skin.      "Prime" refers to the toughened, more durable pelts that      are harvested during January and February. After that, the      critters' long hair begins to fall out, and their coats      become "ratty" looking, but even summer hides will often      bring in from $100 to $400!    </p>    <p>      The shaggy woollike hair itself can be collected and spun      into buffalo yarn. Unfortunately, it isn't practical to      bring your buffalo "flock" together each spring for a      funfilled, buffalo-shearing day . . . they're far from      being as gentle as lambs!    </p>    <p>      Instead, you will have to collect the wool from places      where the animals have rubbed it off ... in their wallows      or on their scratching posts. Bison are avid scratchers . .      . rubbing their skin blissfully on a chosen fencepost,      tree, or rock. In fact, many of our early western telegraph      poles were downed when over-enthusiastic buffaloes selected      them as backscratchers! And, in the summertime, bison will      roll in wet areas to give themselves mud coats for fly      protection.    </p>    <p>      The majestic good looks of a bull buffalo open up yet      another potential market for the bison herder. The mounted      head of a large bull with an impressive set of horns (cows      have horns, too, but those on a bull's more massive head      are generally larger) will sometimes bring from $500 to      $1,000, although it will cost about $400 to $800 to have      the "trophy" processed by an experienced taxidermist.    </p>    <p>      And, as is the case with any animal enterprise, the sale of      good breeding stock can provide an important part of the      overall income from a buffalo herd. Bison for breeding are      sold by the head-not by the pound-and prices,      of course, vary greatly from area to area, and from animal      to animal . . . but a buyer can figure on paying $200 to      $700 for a calf or yearling, while a mature bull may run      several thousand dollars.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUFFALO "HUNTS"<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Yet another potential moneymaker is available to the bison      breeder . . . one that may not appeal to many folks,      but-when carefully controlled-can provide a legitimate      source of income.    </p>    <p>      There are, you see, plenty of men and women out there who      seem to fancy themselves latter-day "Buffalo Bills". Such      individuals are quite willing to pay a large fee for the      privilege of hunting down (read that as "walking into the      pasture") and shooting a trophy bull.    </p>    <p>      Depending on your point of view, this idea may sound either      abhorrent or ludicrous, but using this method to replace      standard butchering practices can have some advantages:    </p>    <p>      [1] A well-placed bullet is as humane a way to butcher an      animal as any (it's hard to be sure, though, that your      hunters-to-be are well-qualified marksmen who won't make      poor, crippling shots).    </p>    <p>      [2] Large bulls can be nigh onto impossible to drive out of      the range or lure into a corral, and on-the-range      butchering is often the only practical thing to do.    </p>    <p>      [3] There's nothing a buffalo likes less than a      fenced-in corral. A one- to two-ton bull will crash      through all but the sturdiest of holding pens, and if your      corral fence isn't strong enough, you could find yourself      chasing a to-be-butchered bull and his harem all across the      prairie.    </p>    <p>      [4] Some folks believe that an animal's fear or stress      reaction causes chemical changes that affect meat flavor      and possibly even make it less wholesome. And-in      watching the buffalo roundup at the Kansas Fish and Game      Department's annual sale-it seemed to me that the      adult bulls were much more easily spooked than were the      cows. Because of their intense fear of holding pens, you      might be able to produce better meat by butchering mature      bulls out on the range, and thus avoiding the drive to a      corral and inevitable trauma.    </p>    <p>      Considering the foregoing points, some buffalo ranchers      argue that, if people are willing to pay to make the kill      for you, why not let them? (Of course, the price you charge      the "mighty hunters" will depend upon what parts of the      animal, if any, they may want to keep.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUFFALO HUSBANDRY<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Bison are grazing ruminants that feed on natural prairie      grasses or planted pas tures with equal enthusiasm. Some      folks claim that it's possible to maintain three adult      buffaloes on the same range where two cows could be kept,      but most experienced herders will tell you to figure about      the same amount of pasture for each bison as you'd give a      cow of the same weight. (The size of the per-animal area,      of course, will depend entirely on how good your grassland      is. A buffalo cow and her calf might need only one acre of      lush pasture, while it'd take five to ten acres to support      the same animals in my part of Kansas ... and in      near-desert regions where the grass is very sparse, a cow      and calf-bovine or buffalo-would require as much as      20 to 40 acres.)    </p>    <p>      Bison breed in the late summer or early fall, and a      female's gestation period-like that of a cow-is      approximately 275 days (nine months). Most calves are born      between April 15 and June 15 (though some stragglers may      not arrive until September), and the whole herd will assume      the responsibility of protecting the babies. When the young      first appear, they have tawny red coats, which are lost in      about four months. The calves begin to graze very early,      although they may still nurse when they're yearlings.    </p>    <p>      Both bison bulls and heifers reach sexual maturity in the      third or fourth summer. But bulls in herds that already      have established sires may not become effective breeders      until they're six to eight years old, since the newcomers      will be unable to compete for mating privileges until      they've gained the strength and experience to earn      positions within the herd. Don't let this working out of      the social order bother you, though. Such "battles of the      bulls" are short, and seldom result in serious harm to the      participants.    </p>    <p>      Though some buffalo breeders maintain a one-to-one ratio of      bulls to cows, most keep only one male for every ten      females. With a one-to-ten ratio, you can figure on an 80      to 90% calf crop each year. You can also expect your      buffalo to continue producing young for a long time, since      bison in captivity may live to be 30 to 40 years old. (You      can easily spot the old codgers, because-with      advancing age-their horns will become rough, increase      in curvature and diameter, begin to splinter, and generally      look worn.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>A WONDERFUL WILD STREAK<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Keeping bison "home on the range" can prove to be      difficult. Provided they have adequate room to roam,      buffaloes do tend to respect a fence more than cows do.      Rather than push against it or crane their necks through it      for that always greener grass beyond, the beasts will      contentedly munch on their own side of a barrier . . . but      this tolerance goes only so far: A frightened herd can      stampede through or over almost anything in its way.      Buffaloes can outrun most horses . .. jump a fence better      than deer ... muscle their way through a barrier in      bulldozer fashion . . . and move so quickly that, when a      panicked animal begins to bounce from one side of a corral      to the other, it can look a lot like a monstrous handball      flying about a giant court.    </p>    <p>      A four- to five-foot barrier, with five strands of wire, is      considered minimum fencing by most owners. And a corral      needs to be built of 8- to 10-foot-high iron or 2 X 10      boards mounted inside 8 - to 10-inch-thick posts (as shown      in the accompanying photos).    </p>    <p>      The fact is that bison haven't changed much over the years,      no matter how hard folks have tried to "civilize" the      beasts. These proud animals always have been and still are      wild creatures. Domestication may seem to work for a while,      but eventually nature will reassert itself . . . and a ton      of "tame" buffalo that suddenly reverts to crazy-eyed      ferocity can-in seconds wreak havoc on fences, other      critters, or the nearest human.    </p>    <p>      However, most buffalo herders admire the animals for their      permanent wildness. While such men and women never forget      the potentially destructive force that lurks beneath the      creatures' usually placid behavior, they feel that raising      the once abused beasts combines the preservation of an      important part of the Old West with a modern approach to      earning an income.    </p>    <p>      If you agree-and if you have the necessary rangeland,      the fences, and the good sense to maintain a healthy      respect (and admiration) for the buffalo's tremendous      strength-keeping a bison herd might be just the      livestock operation for you.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Further information about bison as livestock      may be obtained from the American Buffalo Association      (Dept.
