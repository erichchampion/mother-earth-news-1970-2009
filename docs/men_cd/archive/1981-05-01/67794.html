                <p>      Your little ones can entertain themselves with these . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Stephanie Mendelson</h5>     	<p>      Most toys produced nowadays seem outrageously expensive,      easily broken, and unnecessarily complicated . . . but my      youngsters have inspired me (and taught me how) to create      playthings out of free, readily available materials.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A HORSE SWING</strong>    </p>    <p>      For example, while taking a stroll through our woods one      day, I spied a young locust tree with a beautiful curve at      its base. Immediately, I realized that the bottom of the      trunk would make a sturdy and graceful swing for my      daughter. So, since I also needed some posts of about the      tree's diameter, I cut it down. (At the time, I thought the      bent section was unique, but-as is often the case      after one first notices a "new" thing-I've since seen      many others like it.)    </p>    <p>      Back at the house, I stripped off the trunk's bark . . .      which is quite an easy thing to do while the wood is green.      Then, using a brace with a one-inch bit, I drilled two      parallel holes from the swing-to-be's side, one at each end      of my child's future "flying" steed.    </p>    <p>      Next, I sawed a pair of 1"-diameter lengthseach about      8" longer than the width of the locust log-from a      straight hardwood branch. Once I'd whittled off the bark      and blunted the ends (children and sharp objects should      never mix!), the stubs fit through the holes. Ropes were      then attached to the available ends of the crosspieces to      suspend the swing.    </p>    <p>      Our "hanging horse" can be used safely by any child old      enough to hold him- or herself in place on it, and of      course the height can be adjusted to suit the length of the      little one's legs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BARK PIPELINES</strong>    </p>    <p>      The remainder of the locust tree was o stripped and cut      into fenceposts, and the process produced a pile of curled      bark. Our four-year-old masterminded a water engineering      project-using the leftovers-that became more      elaborate as time went on. I thought his homemade aquaduct      was a fine toy, but just a toy . . . until I visited our      neighbors farther down the mountain and saw their spring      water flowing through a bark-strip conduit!    </p>    <p>      <strong>BARK BOATS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Another bark project will turn the small scraps (those that      are about 2" or 2-1/2" wide and 3" to 4" long) into little      "Viking ships".    </p>    <p>      First, use a nail to press holes into the bark at any      points where you want to locate masts (the uprights are      made from thin sticks whittled to a point).      Trapezoid-shaped pieces of paper (or big leaves) can serve      as sails. Just slip them onto the sticks and mount the      masts in the nail holes.    </p>    <p>      When you blow on the little "barks", they sail prettily on      the water, and there're almost always a few exciting      sinkings to watch.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A PLAYING PLATFORM</strong>    </p>    <p>      The next time you have to cut down trees near your house,      leave a little more stump than you ordinarily would . . .      for a sturdy foundation on which to build a playing      platform!    </p>    <p>      To make the structure shown in the accompanying photo, it      was necessary to set a post in the ground at a point about      six feet from two serviceable stumps. Then we spiked a 2 X      4 from each stump to the post, to form a triangular base .      . . nailed some old boards across these two beams . . . and      added a small ladder.    </p>    <p>      Since this "playform" is shaded by greenery, it has the      feel of a tree house . . . or it can be a pretend pirate      ship, a goblin's cave, or a knight's castle. And you can      bet it sees a lot of use on hot summer days!    </p>
