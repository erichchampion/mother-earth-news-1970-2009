        <h3>From <i>Dear Mother</i> - Dec/Jan 2005</h3><p>Jonathan McElroy’s letter was shocking but understandable to me. Some of my friends who study the Bible say that everything on Earth was put here solely for humans to use and consume. They also say “populate and you will prosper,” which I believe is leading us to a very unhealthy overpopulation.</p><p>Some people have a blind faith and a disregard/disrespect for Mother Earth. I haven’t lost all faith in humans because I know that there are more and more people who understand and believe the importance of sustainability.</p><h5>Jim Olson<br />McCall, Idaho</h5><p><br /></p>
