        <h3>From <i>Dear Mother</i> - Dec/Jan 2005</h3><p>As a small producer of grass-fed beef, I would like to thank Nancy Smith (“<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Whole_Foods_and_Cooking/2005_October_and_November/Better_Beef" target="_blank">Better Beef</a>,” October/November 2005) for a job well done. I have experienced the “learning curve” of raising tender, delicious grass-finished beef. Starting with the right genetics is crucial. We use Lowlines - a small Angus breed developed in Australia with the express purpose of providing grass-fed beef for the upscale restaurant trade. Our three-quarter-blood steers finish in 20 to 24 months at 800 to 1,000 pounds. They are extremely tender and tasty. We believe that once we get our grasses properly established and our management down they will finish months younger.</p><p>As we live 150 miles from any kind of city, we expected marketing to be a problem, but we are finding that local people are accepting that grass-fed beef is healthier and has a great taste. We sold our first grass-fed animal two years ago and currently have customers in five states. My wife does not care to go to restaurants and order beef anymore as it usually does not meet the taste and quality standards we have come to expect.</p><h5>Dwaine Umberger<br />Rosebud Beef Ranch<br />Herrick, South Dakota</h5><br />
