        <h3>Q & A with Alternative Energy Expert Scott Sklar</h3><br /><br /><b>Q.</b> I was in a debate with someone who said that renewable(solar, wind, hydroelectricity, etc.) energy should just compete ina free market like every other industry and should stop receivinggovernment and state subsidies. I wanted to disagree with him, butI didn't have the facts.<br /><br />? John Z.; Denver, Colorado<br /><br /><br /><b>A.</b> The United States subsidizes its coal and oil industriesmore than any other country, so there is no 'free market.' Someexamples of these subsidies are oil and gas depletion allowances,special treatments for coal royalties, tax waivers for companieswith overseas refineries and federal appropriations for black/brownlung benefits for coal miners. There are many other subsidies, andthey all total billions of dollars per year.<br /><br />In comparison, renewable energy receives much less ? under $100million per year in subsidies. If we are going to shift torenewable energy before oil and gas run out, we need to shifttaxpayer subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables.<br /><br /><br />
