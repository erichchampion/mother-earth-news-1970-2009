        <h3>From <i>Dear Mother</i> - Dec/Jan 2005</h3><p>I couldn’t agree more with your arguments for grass-fed beef; however, in listing appropriate breeds for grass-finishing, you overlooked the Scotch Highland breed. The Highland uses a long double coat of hair rather than a fat layer for warmth; thus it produces a carcass lower in fat to begin with - the lowest in fat and cholesterol of any beef breed. These animals will thrive on “pasture” that will leave other breeds starved. They are often only slightly larger than the Dexter - a perfect size for the small family farm - and are sweet-tempered. As for taste, a Highland steak is the best one can get. Don’t believe me? Check with the Queen of England - her herds at Balmoral are Highlands. The one drawback of Highlands? You may find them too cute to slaughter!</p><h5>Chris Clendenen<br />Glen Haven Farm<br />Siloam Springs, Arkansas</h5>
