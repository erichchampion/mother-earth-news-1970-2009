        From <i>Dear Mother</i> - Dec/Jan 2005<br /><p>Love the latest issue - don’t change a thing! The October/November 2005 edition offers inspiration and hope on almost every page. I have passed my copy around at the hardware store/home center where I work and copied other parts for family members. Of particular use were the “secure compost bin,” the “plastic lumber” and “insulated panels” items, and the in-depth coverage of alternative vehicles. A co-worker has a new hybrid, others talk often about getting better mileage and lowering their environmental impact. My wife and I drive older Geo Metros.</p><p>I gave a co-worker in the power tools department a copy of the electric chain saw article. And I left the issue open to the “<a href="http://motherearthnews.com/Whole_Foods_and_Cooking/2005_October_and_November/Better_Beef" target="_blank">Better Beef</a>” article for my wife to see (she is always looking for better meat). Of personal interest to me were the articles on garlic (I’ve been growing hardneck rocambole and elephant “garlic” since 1999, after receiving some bulbs from a friend), and bats (one of my first published news articles in the 1980s was on the benefits of bats and the work of <a href="http://www.batcon.org/home/default.asp" target="_blank">Bat Conservation International</a>). I’ve come a long way toward “living wisely” since moving from Brooklyn to the country here in Bucks County. MOTHER has helped me all along the way.</p><h5>Robert L.
