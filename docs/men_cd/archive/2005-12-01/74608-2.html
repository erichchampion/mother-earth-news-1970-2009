        The annual cost and energy (in millions of British thermal units) savings for Energy Star-qualified double-pane windows over common single-pane windows, based on population-weighted regional average annual energy use for a 2,000-square-foot single-story house with 15-percent glazing, gas heat and electric air conditioning. Estimates use August 2004 state average utility rates. Actual savings will vary by region and home characteristics. For more information about this chart, go to www.energystar.gov/windows.
