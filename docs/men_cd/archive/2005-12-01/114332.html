        <p>When Robert Redford was 29 years old and making his debut on Broadway, he couldn’t shake his longing for a wilderness retreat from the hustle of New York City. Having grown up in a working-class neighborhood in Southern California, Redford had come to know nature as his way out, “a release from chaos and confinement, an incredible liftoff.” On a whim, young Redford trekked into rural Utah and bought a two-acre plot in the Wasatch Mountains, shelling out his entire net worth, $500, for the land.</p><p>Now, Redford is 68 years old and over the years his investment has grown into almost 5,000 acres. At its center is a scenically spectacular and sustainable resort named after the Sundance Kid, his role as the sidekick to Paul Newman’s Butch Cassidy in the classic 1969 film.</p><p>One afternoon last summer, Redford dismounted his horse and strolled the cobblestone paths of Sundance Village toward the Tree Room, a rustic restaurant at the heart of the resort. Sporting weathered blue jeans, cowboy boots and a slightly bowlegged swagger, he looked like he was en route to meet Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday at the OK Corral. In fact, he was headed to a meeting with former Vice President Al Gore, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and dozens of mayors from across the United States who had convened at Redford’s invitation.</p><p>Just before entering the dining hall-a beautiful wood-paneled room with an ancient oak tree growing up through the center and floor-to-ceiling windows-Redford walked past a passage inscribed on the wall:</p><p><em>This place in the mountains,<br />amid nature’s casualness toward death<br />and birth,<br />is the perfect host for the inspiration of ideas:<br />harsh at times, life-threatening in its winters of destruction,<br />but tender in attention to the details<br />of every petal of every wildflower resurrected in the spring.<br />Nature and creativity obey the same laws,<br />to the same end: life.</em></p><p>The words are Redford’s own-something he scrawled in his journal years ago. “I was a bit self-conscious about putting that on the wall,” he winces. “I thought maybe it was corny, or grandiose. But my kids found it and thought it was important, so I got out-voted.”</p><p><strong>CULTIVATING INNOVATION</strong></p><p>Decades after founding Sundance, Redford has racked up an impressive resume: He has appeared in 34 films, directed six and produced 25. He has been nominated for several Oscars, winning one for directing Ordinary People and a second as a lifetime achievement award. His lesser-known achievements include extensive work that helped pave the way for important environmental laws, including those that make clean air and water a right for every American.</p><p>Redford also has developed Sundance-both the resort and its extensions-with foresight and a philanthropic spirit. The Sundance brand represents a broad suite of entities: the Sundance Film Festival, which has become synonymous with independent cinema; the cable channel and DVD/videotape line that distributes independent films; the nonprofit Sundance Institute that produces both the film festival and year-round programs for emerging artists; and the place itself-where the programs are held and where about 500,000 people visit each year to use its hiking trails, ski slopes and other amenities.</p>
