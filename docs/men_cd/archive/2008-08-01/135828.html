        <p>Has your child ever had chewing gum stuck in his or her hair, and you had to resort to cutting it out? My daughter had this happen recently, but she was determined that we weren’t going to cut it out.</p><p>Then I remembered a trick my grandmother used years ago - peanut butter. She had me rub a tablespoon of peanut butter into and around the wad of gum stuck in my hair. The oil in the peanut butter loosened the gum. Then she had me wash my hair and the gum came out. It worked on my daughter’s hair, too. So, no scissors!</p><h5>Barbara Workman<br />Auburn, Washington</h5>
