        <p>An inventive new twist to the greening of our future, <em>This Green Pl</em>anet, by Hayes Greenfield, is a playful, jazzy collection of children’s music that will appeal to audiences of all ages, using eclectic instrumentation and eco-friendly lyrics.</p><p>The album, released this past Earth Day, includes a refreshing look at some of our favorite children’s songs. Greenfield, a New York saxophonist, breathes new life into this collection of tunes. His solo sax introduces a new version of “She’ll Be Comin’ ’Round the Mountain:” Verse two becomes “We’ll be cruisin’ in our hybrid when she comes.” Each song, based on traditional children’s tunes, touches on themes of renewable energy, recycling, ecology and more.</p><p>The disc holds up to its name; stylistically transporting the listener to Brazil, New Orleans, the Caribbean and more - all without the use of fossil fuels. Plus, the disc was packaged using vegetable and soy-based ink as well as recycled paper.</p><p>Like a master weaver, Greenfield fuses jazz and kids’ music, children’s voices and established musicians throughout the recording in a way that is pleasantly cohesive.
