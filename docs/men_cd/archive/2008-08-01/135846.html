        <p>Even if your poultry roam free for a natural diet of pasture and bugs, you need a little feed to round out the menu. Hubbard Feeds recently announced a new product line, Homestead Poultry Feeds, which contains no antibiotics and no animal proteins. The lineup consists of six products: chick starter, grower for meat birds (chickens and turkeys), a ration for egg layers, duck and goose feed, turkey starter and a concentrate for mixing with your own grains to produce a balanced feed. In addition to grains, vitamins and minerals, the feeds contain Opti-Remedy, a blend of essential oils (oregano, thyme, cinnamon, capsicum and fruit extract) and organic selenium to boost immunity and maintain health.</p><p>Chickens raised for meat can eat the grower ration, FastGrow, until they’re butchered. FastGrow also can be used for starting heavy-breed egg layer chicks. You can find ingredient lists and feeding directions for each product <a title="here" href="http://www.homesteadfeeds.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. The Web site provides a recipe for mixing the concentrate, Chick-En-Egg, with corn for use as a starter, grower, developer or layer ration for chickens. But if you raise grain other than corn, Hubbard will formulate a mix that works for you. You can find a dealer <a title="here" href="http://www.hubbardfeeds.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, or your local feed store can contact Hubbard to get information on selling the feed.</p>
