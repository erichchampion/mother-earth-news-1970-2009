            			<p>      <strong>MOTHER'S NATURAL KITCHEN</strong>    </p>        <p>      The ultimate feast for the dog days.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne Vassal.    </h5>        <p>      Okay, all you smoked food lovers, it's time for the Smoking      Quiz. The question: If you want your meat to have a smoky      flavor you would: a) put the lid on the grill while you're      grilling the meat, b) throw some water-soaked wood chips on      the coals in your grill, c) drown the meat in liquid smoke      and call it a day. And the answer is ...none of the above.      Save the "Am I mentally challenged?" remarks until I      confess to you that six months ago, I would have flunked      for sure. I just loved that smoky flavor, but I was unable      to produce a piece of smoked food without my trusty bottle      of smoke oil and a jar of barbecue sauce. The confusing      question for me was, "Is there a difference between      grilling and smoking?"    </p>    <p>      Grilling is basically putting on a silly apron, arming      yourself with grilling tools, and setting the food on fire.      Unless you're grilling a turkey, the food cooks fast and      furious, charred on the outside but tender on the inside.      Before your attention can deficit, it's time to eat.      Smoking, on the other hand, is a slower cooking process,      requiring some patience. The food is cooked by smoking it      at a lower temperature so that the smoky flavor can      penetrate the food. Smoking meat is also healthier than      grilling, since carcinogens are known to be produced by      meat juices dripping onto coals. With smoking, the juices      drip into a water pan.    </p>    <p>      So now, you're convinced and ready to convert your kettle      grill into a smoker, right?    </p>    <p>      Forget it, I've been there. After I figured out that my      grill was incapable of smoking food, I called Brinkmann, a      Texas company specializing in smoker grills and      accessories, to get my hands on a water smoker. The      trial-and-error cooking process was mercifully brief, and      soon the gentle but maddening aroma was turning heads a      hundred yards in every direction. Smoking food isn't      difficult; you just have to force yourself to hang around      the backyard all afternoon, catching rays and drinking      whatever. It's a tough call, but you can do it.    </p>    <h3>      EQUIPMENT    </h3>    <p>      <strong>The Smoker</strong>    </p>    <p>      The vertical charcoal water smoker is the most commonly      used smoker. It's a cylindrical-shaped unit that resembles      Star Wars' R2-D2. Our Brinkmann water smoker retails for      about $60. The unit contains two racks for grilling, a      water pan, and the heat source: either coals or a      detachable electric coil, which can be purchased as an      option. In water smokers, the food is steamed and smoked,      which prevents leaner meats from drying out. The water pan      can also be filled with beer or wine for added flavor.    </p>    <p>      The smoker also has a little door on the front-handy      for feeding the fire without letting out too much heat. An      optional electric attachment keeps the fire burning for you      and comes with a small metal tray, which holds the wood      chunks used to create smoke (though we actually prefer      charcoal). Our only complaint with the electric coil is      that it only has one temperature at the "ideal" setting,      making it difficult to adjust the heat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Fuel</strong>    </p>    <p>      You'll need a bag of charcoal briquettes, but never use the      self-starting variety. We use a combination of standard      briquettes, mixed with some hickory or mesquite hardwood      charcoal, which is petroleum-free and burns longer, You'll      also need the essential flavor-producing wood chunks, but      only hardwood will do. Soft woods such as pine, cedar, or      birch contain too much sap and will produce undesirable      smoke and creosote. Some good hardwoods are hickory, oak,      mesquite, maple, apple, cherry, and grapevine. Obviously,      each wood creates its own flavor, so it's fun to      experiment. We convinced our neighbor to donate some apple      branches to our cause-with delicious results. Opt for      wood chunks or blocks over chips; they burn longer and      produce more smoke.    </p>    <p>      Try to find fresh green wood and chop it into approximately      one-inch by three-inch pieces. If fresh wood is      unavailable, soak dry wood chunks in water for about an      hour before using.    </p>    <h3>      SMOKING TIPS    </h3>    <p>      Obviously, it's important that you read the smoker manual,      but we have a few additional suggestions:    </p>        <p>      Start smoking early. If you start smoking late in the      afternoon, you may run out of daylight and the family will      faint from starvation. Allow enough time for errors, since      fire and weather are both unpredictable.    </p>        <p>      Use an oven thermometer so you don't need to rely on the      smoker's built-in "ideal" thermometer.    </p>        <p>      It's important to keep the water pan filled, since some of      the liquid will evaporate after a few hours. When you're      finished smoking, save the poultry water; it makes great      soup.    </p>        <p>      On cold or windy days, allow for longer cooking times. If      your smoker's temperature is too low (below 200°F), add      more coals.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Smokin'*</strong>    </p>        <p>      Find a safe, wind-protected spot for the smoker. Place a      large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil under the smoker      legs to catch any embers or drippings. Fill the charcoal      pan with a mound of charcoal and saturate with lighter      fluid. (A full charcoal pan will burn about five to six      hours, depending on the weather.) Fill the water pan with      warm water, wine, or beer to one inch below the rim and      place it inside the smoker. Never put a salty brine in your      water pan or you'll ruin the pan. Let the lighter fluid      soak in for about three minutes before lighting, making      sure the door is open and the dome lid removed. Light the      charcoal and let the lighter fluid burn off for about      fifteen minutes.    </p>        <p>      Stir the coals, add three to four wood chunks, and place      them inside the smoker. Place the thicker pieces of fish or      meat on the lower rack, smaller pieces on the top rack,      leaving space between each piece for air to circulate. If      you have only enough meat for one rack, use the top rack.      Shut the door and put on the dome lid.    </p>        <p>      Check the smoker every hour by opening the little door, not      by removing the lid. You want to make sure that the fire      doesn't die out and that your wood chunks are creating      smoke. If smoke isn't visibly pouring out of your smoker,      add a few more wood chunks. Keep adding additional charcoal      and wood chunks as needed Your goal is to try to keep the      temperature registering at the "ideal" (225°F) setting      on the smoker thermometer. Even 200°F is fine, but if      the temperature is too high, the food will dry out. After a      few hours, the water pan will need more water. Refer to the      manual for refilling instructions. Resist the temptation to      remove the lid-you don't want to let out the heat.      Don't worry-nothing can burn to a crisp in a smoker.    </p>        <p>      Only when you're sure the food is almost done should you      remove the lid. You'll want to make certain the meat or      fish has finished cooking, but first remove it from the      smoker to avoid letting out too much heat. Then check each      piece, either with a meat thermometer or by slicing into      its center. Smoked meat and poultry will look slightly pink      even when it's done, so a meat thermometer is a good idea.      (I like the $10 instant-read thermometer. but don't leave      it inside the smoker or it will melt.)    </p>    <p>      Anytime you're playing with fire, there's some danger      involved. Read carefully the manual warnings. Use long      tongs and fire-proof oven mitts when you're adding fuel or      removing the food. The smoker's exterior gets very hot, so      lock up the dog and the kids.    </p>    <p>      *Refer to your smoker manual for detailed instructions.    </p>        <p>      What to Smoke    </p>    <p>      No, not the neighbor's, yip py dog. Here's what worked well      for us:    </p>        <p>      Fattier fish, such as salmon, whitefish, lake trout, and      sea bass smoke well. Any fish can be smoked, but we found      the less fatty or thinner fish to be drier tasting. We      soaked the fish in a salty brine to add flavor and to      remove some of the fish juices. Health conscious? Not to      worry, this process still leaves plenty of essential fatty      acids (EFAs), containing good-for-you omega3s, in the fish.    </p>        <p>      Smoke anything in a casing. Smoking will jazz up a plain of      hot dog more than mustard will.    </p>        <p>      We've smoked a roasting chicken, which took about five      hours. But since we aren't crazy about the idea of keeping      an eye on the smoker for ten or so hours, we've avoided      smoking larger cuts of meat. Also, I was concerned about      the meat or poultry's internal temperature being too low      for too long a time, possibly causing bacteria to grow. But      according to research conducted by U.S.D.A.      microbiologists, the moisture caused by the water in the      pan destroys any pathogens (evil bacteria) that may be      present in the meat. Also, curing the meat in a salty brine      has the same effect. While you would never cook your turkey      in a 225°F oven, it's okay to water-smoke it at that      temperature for ten hours (but without the stuffing).    </p>        <p>      Try smoking non-meats, such as teriyaki tofu, portibello      mushrooms, potatoes, and heads of garlic. As long as you      have room in the smoker, you might as well rub oil on a few      potatoes and put them on the top rack. Wrap a garlic head      drizzled with olive oil in foil and stab with a fork to      make vents.    </p>    <p>      Remember that at 225°F, it will take at least two hours      for potatoes and garlic. We don't smoke vegetables because      it takes so long that they shrivel up and dry out. Grill or      roast your vegetables instead.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Smoked Fish</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's your chance to use up that huge fish you caught at      Lake Gitchygoomy last summer. Don't forget to thaw the      packaged fish in cold water first. Plan ahead; the brining      process takes two days.* Start with about two pounds of      fish fillets (fresh or previously frozen), cut into three-      to four-inch squares    </p>    <p>      <strong>Paul's Fish Brine</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/2 cup each: white vinegar, brown sugar, salt (I      used</em> <em>1/3 cup salt, making the fish not quite as      salty, which I prefer) 1 quart water (4 cups)</em>    </p>    <p>      Two nights before smoking: Whisk the marinade together in a      large glass bowl or casserole. Place the fish fillets in      the brine and refrigerate for 24 hours. The next day:      Remove the fish from the brine and pat dry with paper      towels. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and lay the      fish, skin-side-down, on the sheet(s). Refrigerate      overnight.    </p>    <p>      The second day: Prepare the smoker. When the coals are      ready, lay the fillets, skin-side-down, on the grills. The      middle grill usually cooks food faster, so place the larger      fillets there. Smoke the fish for about two hours at the      "ideal" temperature, which is 225°F to 250°F, then      check it. Thicker fish will take about three hours. The      fish is done when it has a caramelized-brown color and      feels firm to the touch. If you smoke the fish too long, it      will get too dry, chewy, and salty, since most of the      juices will have been smoked away. I prefer my smoked fish      still moist, but it won't keep quite as long this way.    </p>    <p>      Storing smoked fish: Cool the fish thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      Never wrap smoked fish in plastic because it will develop a      strange taste. Put a few pieces of fish in a paper lunch      bag, a few more in another bag, and so on. If you have more      then one variety of fish, label the bags with a marking      pen. Leave the bags open and place them on plates in your      refrigerator for up to one week. The paper bags will get      greasy-looking as they absorb the fish oil.    </p>    <p>      *You'll notice very little difference if you skip the      overnight drying-out-the-fish step. If you're in a hurry,      take the fish out of the brine after 24 hours, pat dry, and      smoke.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Smoked Fish Spread</strong>    </p>    <p>      It is possible to smoke too much fish, so I called Paul's      mother for her famous fish dip or spread. Here it is, with      a few minor changes.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup shredded smoked fish (Don't use hard end      pieces.)<br />      4 ounces "lite" cream cheese<br />      1 teaspoon lemon juice a dash of cayenne pepper<br />      1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard cup<br />      1/4 chopped curly parsley (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      In a food processor, mix all the ingredients together until      smooth. If it's too thick, add more lemon juice. Spoon into      a bowl and top with chopped parsley (the green will dress      up the grey dip; making it took more appetizing). Spread      onto crusty bread, toasted pita wedges, or crackers. Also,      it makes a great bagel sandwich with lettuce, red onion,      and tomato. Delicious!    </p>        <p>      Smoked Chicken Oregano    </p>    <p>      Plan to soak the chicken in the marinade overnight. Smoke a      few pieces of extra chicken so you can make some smoked      soup. Start with six to eight chicken thighs or breasts      with skin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marinade:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/2 cup</em> <em>olive oil<br />      1/2 cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)<br />      4 large cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped<br />      2 tablespoons dried oregano (or 1/2 cup chopped fresh      oregano)<br />      1 teaspoon salt</em>    </p>    <p>      At least eight hours before smoking, blend the marinade in      a blender. Wash and pat dry the chicken with paper towels.      Loosen the skin slightly on each piece of chicken. Place      the chicken and marinade in zip-lock bags and refrigerate.      Prepare the smoker, then remove the chicken from the      marinade and let it sit on a platter at room temperature      for 20 minutes. Discard the marinade. When the smoker      temperature is 200°F 225°F, place the chicken in      the smoker, skin side up. Smoke for two to two-and-a-half      hours, until the meat near the bone is no longer pink (dark      meat takes longer). Remember to wash the raw chicken      platter well before placing the cooked chicken back on it.      Save the broth in the smoker bowl for soup. Refrigerate or      freeze until needed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Smoked Chicken Soup</strong>    </p>    <p>      It would be a pity to waste the smoky broth. Feel free to      add any vegetables that are on hand or leftover cooked      beans. I've added cut green beans on occasion; put them in      the pot for the last ten minutes or so.    </p>    <p>      <em>Broth from the smoker bowl (about</em> <em>6      cups)<br />      2 to 4 pieces of smoked chicken<br />      1 large onion, chopped<br />      3 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced into thin slivers<br />      2 carrots, sliced into 1/4" circles<br />      2 turnips or rutabaga, quartered and cut into thin      slices<br />      2 cups cauliflower pieces<br />      3 canned tomatoes (plum or regular), chopped<br />      1 teaspoon dried basil<br />      1/2 teaspoon each: thyme, oregano, salt<br />      freshly ground pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper<br />      8 ounces egg noodles</em>    </p>    <p>      In a large soup pot, add about a tablespoon each of smoked      broth, onion, and garlic. Saute until soft, then add the      rest of the ingredients with the exception of the noodles.      Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Check      to see if the vegetables are tender and add more water to      the soup if necessary. Remove the chicken pieces, pick the      meat off the bones, and return the chicken to the pot,      discarding the bones. Prepare the noodles in a separate      pot, drain, and serve with the soup. This soup can be      frozen without the noodles, but if you plan to freeze it,      don't cook it quite as long.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Smoked Sausages and Hot Dogs</strong>    </p>    <p>      Smoking will transform a humble hot dog into a delicious      smoked sausage. Anything in a casing will do-Italian      sausage, brats, Andouille sausage, turkey dogs, etc. Keep      in mind that precooked sausages such as hot dogs only need      to be heated and not cooked like Italian sausages. Allow      more time for uncooked sausages.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sausages or Dogs with Olive Oil:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Prepare the fire in the smoker. Rub the sausages with off      and let them sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. Place      them on the smoker grill and smoke at about 200°F to      225°F for one to one-and-a-half hours, until the skins      are ready to pop. Turn the sausages to allow even cooking,      checking the interiors occasionally to see if they're done.      Over-smoking will dry out especially the leaner varieties,      such as chicken sausage.    </p>
