            			<p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Make your own humane box trap.</strong>    </p>        <p>      I was recently faced with removing a family of squirrels      who had set up winter housekeeping in my attic. Attempts to      drive them off using the "ol' mothball trick" failed      miserably. Mothballs allegedly possess some kind of      squirrel-repellent properties. Possibly if fired at then      from a shotgun-otherwise I can't agree.    </p>    <p>      The squirrels had to go. Commercial live-catch traps proved      prohibitive, costwise, and I wasn't about to call in a pro.      Snares and leg-hold traps are "messy," and I really saw no      reason to kill our little guests. So I was left with      designing and constructing the following live-catch trap on      my own.    </p>    <p>      The trap consists of an open-ended box, one end covered      with wire screen or mesh and the other having a flap-type      door supported by a simple prop for the trigger. The door      is the key to the entire project: it opens inward and is      beveled on its bottom edge, so that when our furry friend      knocks or brushes the prop aside, the door (possibly made      from heavier material than the trap sides or even weighted      for a quick 'n clean drop) closes and, try as he might, the      animal can't pull the door inward to escape.    </p>        <p>      My trap is slightly bulkier and cruder than it needs to be,      but it has undergone several modifications from its      original, prototype form. With my first attempt, I made the      trap too short and so the door would actually drop on the      animal, allowing him to simply back out.    </p>    <p>      So far, I've only caught squirrels with my trap (and three      wayward blue jays going for the sunflower seed bait), but I      would presume that a raccoon may have the manual dexterity      and cunning needed to work and worry the door open. I would      suggest pretty close tolerances between door and trap      sides.    </p>    <p>      The hinge is just some allpurpose, lightweight steel      strapping (used for securing household pipes, etc.., and      found in plumbing supply sections at most home stores) and      an old wooden dowel.    </p>    <p>      My trap has a "skylight" in the top (I ran out of scrap ply      during the aforementioned mentioned trap-lengthening, but      had plenty of mesh left). This may have been an inadvertent      masterstroke. as it brightens up the interior of the box      and may, to a critter, look like an alternate escape route.      I've also drilled a small hole through the bottom edge of      the door and run a knotted piece of twine through this and      through the skylight mesh, allowing me to stand back a bit      and open the door with the twine, preventing a face full o'      furious fur (or feathers ... a real godsend when releasing      blue jays!).    </p>    <p>      The prop or trigger is any old thing light enough for the      critter to knock aside and heavy enough to support the      door. You can taper the end(s) and/or gouge a small indent      in the floor of the trap and experiment a bit to get it      just right. My original trigger was a T-bar design, its      horizontal strip measuring almost the full width of the      trap interior. But I found I'd attached this crosspiece a      bit too high, allowing the squirrels to scoot underneath      it. Stapling another piece of mesh to this soon rectified      the problem.    </p>    <p>      My handle is from an old five-gallon metal pail. And the      whole shebang is spray-painted with some old flat black I      had lying around, mainly just to take the shine off the      nail and screw heads, etc., though I dare say a few days      outside will do the same job.    </p>    <p>      My working prototype is made largely out of 3/4" plywood      and measures 31"x13"x13". It's on the large side for      squirrels, but I'm anticipating the future relocation of a      raccoon or two.    </p>    <p>      These dimensions can be adapted to suit materials at hand      and the intended quarry. The accompanying illustrations      (opposite page) should allow anyone with a scrap pile and a      couple of hours to kill to construct a humane trap of their      own.
