            	<p>					 <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>		</p>		    <p>      Your dream has come true! You have your country home at      last and are eager to share life with all the flora and      fauna of the area.    </p>    <p>      You've hung a bird feeder, filled a birdbath, and now you      look forward to the beauty, music, and insect-eating      benefits of songbirds around your country space.    </p>    <p>      If you want an additional source of interest and amusement,      this spring set yourself up in the building-supply business      for birds. Every public library and bookstore has books      with instructions on building a variety of nesting and      roosting boxes for such desirable birds as finches,      bluebirds, purple martins, wrens, robins, phoebes, song      sparrows, chickadees, swallows, orioles, cedar waxwings,      and owls. These boxes are a perfect way to use scraps of      wood left from larger projects. Birds prefer rustic      "architecture," so the amateur carpenter need not worry      about perfection. In the South, hard-shells gourds have      long been used effectively as nesting boxes.    </p>    <p>      Of course, songbirds have natural sources for nest-building      materials, but you can augment these and have fun at the      same time.    </p>    <p>      Start by collecting an assortment of twine, yarn scraps,      narrow strips of soft cloth, dried grass sterns, and small      twigs. Even bits of lint from the clothes dryer will      attract some birds, and what better way to recycle them! Be      sure the twine and yarn pieces are no more than four inches      long, so the birds won't hang themselves on them.    </p>    <p>      Pile these nest-building offerings on the ground. Select a      spot where you can watch from your favorite window.      Sparrows use almost anything, but many birds are choosy and      will work hard to extract special items from the pile.      Comic another dimension to bird watching.    </p>    <p>      Marcia Brown McQuaid<br />      Austin, Texas    </p>
