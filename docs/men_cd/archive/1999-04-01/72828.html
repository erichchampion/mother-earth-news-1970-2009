            						<p>			 <strong>HERBAL REMEDIES</strong>    </p>        <p>      TOP TO BOTTOM: SOHM/PHOTO RESEARCHERS; NINA MASCARDI/IMAGE      BANK;<br />      WALTER H. HODGE/PETER ARNOLD; PHOTO RESEARCHERS    </p>    <p>      Medicinal plants of the Southern Appalachians<br />      by Charles Dickson, PhD    </p>    <p>      In 1776, while the Declaration of Independence was being      drafted, the great French botanist, Andre Michaux, stood      atop North Carolina's Grandfather Mountain and sang the      French national anthem. It was a moment that represented      the culmination of years of exploration into the      magnificent variety of plants that flourish in the southern      Appalachians, a concentration of flora unequaled on the      North American continent or even in the whole of Europe.    </p>        <p>      As significant as was the work of Michaux, Native American      tribes such as the Cherokee and the Catawba had been      roaming the lush hillsides and gorges for centuries prior      to his time, discovering a multitude of uses for these      plants-one of the most significant being medicinal.      The region is a veritable outdoor pharmacy of medicinal      plants, which were not only part of the recipes of      yesterday's tribal medicine men, but continue to occupy a      place in today's pharmacopoeias. In fact, so important are      the botanical sources of modem medicines that the      environmental scientist, G. Tyler Miller, has estimated      that 40% of all the medicine on the shelves of today's      drugstores have plant origins.    </p>    <p>      While any attempt at a complete listing of known medicinal      plants of the southern Appalachians might require volumes,      a brief walk along their paths will, I hope, serve to      illustrate the enormous impact the area has had on modem      medical practice.    </p>        <p>      Let's begin with a heart medication. A member of the      figwort family, growing two to five feet in height, is the      purple foxglove (Digitalis purpurea). With lance-shaped to      oval leaves, these spires of thimble-like      flowers-from white to pinkish lavender to red bloom      from June to September. This beautiful plant is the source      of digitalis, a cardiac stimulant extracted from the leaves      that has kept millions of heart patients alive.    </p>          <p>      Foxglove is among the loveliest, most famous, most      important, and most dangerous of medicinal plants. Used      improperly, it is as likely to stop a heart as it is to      keep it going.    </p>    <p>      Its usefulness was first discovered in 1775 by the English      physician, William Withering. He had heard of an old woman      who practiced folk medicine with herbs gathered from the      countryside. A patient afflicted with excessive fluid      retention due to congestive heart failure, whom Withering      expected to die, was cured by this healer.From this woman's      bag of weeds, Withering identified foxglove as the key      element in treating swelling or edema associated with      congestive heart failure. The paper he published in 1785 to      inform other physicians of his findings is a classic of      medical literature.    </p>    <p>      From heart medicine we move to what some have called the      "Prozac of Europe." St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum)      is native to Europe but grows throughout the eastern United      States, including the southern highlands. An erect      perennial shrub with bright yellow flowers from June      through September, it has found extensive use as a      treatment for depression in European medical practice. It      is beginning to enjoy increased usage in the United States;      however, caution should be exercised in its use since St.      John's wort contains hypericin, a photosensitory substance      that reacts with light to cause skin burns in some people.    </p>        <p>      A traditional astringent (skin cleaner) and ingredient in      numerous other pharmaceutical products is witch hazel      (Hamamelis virginiana). It is a bush of the southern      mountains that surprises us by blooming in autumn rather      than spring, putting on a colorful display of bright yellow      flower, that grow in feathery clusters. The name, witch      hazel, developed from its reputed properties as a divining      rod: folklore tells-A of the plant's tendency to bend      toward the earth when held over underground water.    </p>        <p>      Witch hazel is extremely important commercially. The      extract made by distilling the bark and leaves in alcohol      has been used by pharmacists for more than a century.      Bottles on the shelves of drugstores worldwide have labels      recommending use of the extract for bruises. insect bites,      sun burn, poison ivy rash, and as an after-shave lotion.    </p>    <p>      Still another abundant medicinal plant of southern      Appalachia is the mayapple, known botanically as      Podophyllum pelta-tum. These plants usually grow in      clusters with umbrella-like leaves, a white inconspicuous      flower, and a small greenish-yellow- fruit, whose sweet      taste makes it ideal for jams, jellies, and preserves. A      medicinal substance called podophyllum is obtained from the      dried powdered root and, compounded with tincture of      benzoin, is used as a caustic for the removal of warts and      other papillomas.    </p>    <p>      During the warm months of August and September, when little      else blooms in the fields and hillsides, the light blue      flowers of Indian tobacco (Lobelia inflata) grace the      landscape. The stems are yellow to purplish, quite hairy,      and branched about midway. Its medicinal substance is an      alkaloid called lobeline, which is derived from the leaves      and tops of the plant, which, when dried to a powder, are      greenish-yellow in color. Lobeline is used as a respiratory      stimulant and for the treatment of spasmodic bronchitis and      chronic emphysema. Its popular name comes from the fact      that American Indians once smoked its leaves to relieve      asthma and other ailments. In recent years, lobeline has      also found use as an ingredient in preparations designed to      help people curb the smoking habit.    </p>    <p>      Continuing our walk along the paths of the southern      Appalachians, we see brilliant splashes of pumpkin-orange      flowers signifying the presence of butterfly weed      (Asclepias tuberosa). The name is appropriate because      monarchs, swallowtails, and other butterflies are      especially attracted to this member of the milkweed family      when it is in bloom. Although no longer used in modern      medicine because of the highly toxic glycosides in its      roots, butterfly weed was long used by Native Americans,      who powdered the roots and mixed them into a paste to      spread on sores, as well as brewed its leaves to induce      perspiration and expectoration in people with severe      respiratory ailments such as pleurisy. Hence one of its      alternative names: pleurisy root.    </p>    <p>      In early spring in the moist rich recesses of Appalachian      forests, the smooth bluish stem and large single unfolding      leaf of the blue cohosh plant (Caulophyllum thalictroides)      stand out vividly against the surrounding bareness. As the      plant grows, it blends in with the rest of the forest until      late summer, when deep blue berries (which are actually      seeds) attract the eye. Indian tribes used them to relieve      rheumatism, colic, and menstrual cramps. Today, herbalists      continue to use the roots to treat rheumatism.    </p>    <p>      By midsummer, fields and roads of the southern highlands      are crowded with intricately patterned flat flower clusters      of Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota), a member of the      carrot family. Through the years, extracts from this widely      distributed biennial were used medicinally as diuretics and      to dissolve kidney stones. The seeds were eaten to      eliminate intestinal worms and gas.    </p>    <p>      While extracts of Queen Anne's lace are not generally used      by today's herbalist as a diuretic, research has confirmed      their effectiveness in dispelling intestinal gas. The wild      root is also rich in vitamin A, but care should be taken      not to ingest it in excessive amounts. (Too much vitamin A      can be harmful to your health.)    </p>    <p>      Another plant which is native to eastern North America,      including the southern Appalachians, is the Oswego tea      plant (Monarda didyma), sometimes also called bee balm. The      name comes from the use of its aromatic leaves by the      Oswego Indians of western New York and also the Shakers,      who thought the tea to be effective in treating colds and      sore throats. Still other settlers steamed the plant and      inhaled the fumes to clear sinuses. Although medicinal use      of the plant is no longer widespread, the aromatic oil of      Oswego tea continues to be used in the perfume industry.    </p>    <p>      No trip through the southern Appalachians would be complete      without acknowledging one of the most widespread      plants-Mentha piperita-which is the botanical      name for the well-known peppermint. It has the unusual      feature of square stems and rootstocks that take root along      the ground, enabling the plant to spread from one growing      season to the next. The oil is obtained by steam      distillation of the above-ground parts and is used in many      medicinal products, particularly cold remedies.    </p>    <p>      Our journey through the southern Appalachians has touched      on but a few of the myriad plants with healing properties.      In fact, the area is such a rich source of medicinal plants      that the S. B. Penick Company, a botanical drug corporation      headquartered in New York, maintained a branch office in      Asheville, North Carolina for many years.    </p>    <p>      Since prehistoric times, humans have turned to plants for      healing. The quest has not ended in disappointment. Modern      pharmacology will continue to look for new sources of      "green medicine," and one place to which it will surely      return is the lush green forests of the southern      Appalachians. For there has been, and will continue to be,      healing in the mountains.    </p>
