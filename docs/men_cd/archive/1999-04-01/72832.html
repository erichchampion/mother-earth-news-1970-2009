            		<p>				 <strong>BITS AND PIECES</strong>    </p>              <p>      Some thousand people get off the ferris wheel at the Santa      Monica Pier every day and see this sign: "You have just      ridden the world's first solar ferris wheel."    </p>    <p>      Dedicated in October, the ferris wheel is one of the first      projects in Santa Monica's new Solar Neighborhood      Program-an agreement between the city of Santa Monica      and local power provider, Edison Technology      Solutions-to form the first largely solar city in the      U.S. By the light of day, the wheel's 660-photovoltaic      modules generate about 200-kilowatt hours of energy; by      night, the wheel goes back on the power grid.    </p>    <p>      "People still see solar energy as something that didn't      work out in the seventies," says Steve Taylor, manager of      Edison Technology Solutions' Renewable Energy Program.      "We're trying to make solar power a household word and show      people that it really works."    </p>    <p>      According to Taylor, there is no difference in the ride's      feel, and the public's response has been extremely      positive. The city's next important, albeit less      entertaining, solar project will be a 30-kilowatt carport      structure at the Santa Monica Civic Center.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jasmine Fox</em>    </p>
