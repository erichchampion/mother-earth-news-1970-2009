            		<p>				 <strong>ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT</strong>    </p>        <p>      Solar power isn't just for the sun bolters anymore.    </p>		<h5 id="byline">		By Molly Miller		</h5>        <p>      Think you have to live in New Mexico to get enough sun to      run all your lights and appliances with photovoltaic      panels? Maybe you live in Minnesota or Maine and can't see      the sun from November to March. Or in British Columbia or      Alaska, where surely temperatures are too frigid to      efficiently upkeep solar panels. Well, you just might be      unfairly dismissing the solar option. It's time you heard      about a new system of panels that operates year-round above      8,000 feet, in one of the coldest, stormiest stretches of      the Colorado Rockies. In winter, the panels withstand wind,      snow, ice, low light, and temperatures that drop to      -40°F.    </p>    <p>      The power system was designed for the 10th Mountain      Division Hut Association, which maintains a network of ski      huts-24 in all, 13 looped between Aspen and      Vail-that are linked together by cross-country ski      trails. A working experiment in solar for extreme weather      conditions, the 12-volt DC system has been upgraded several      times since it was installed in 1982. And as the      photovoltaic (PV) industry evolves, adding on to and      upgrading the system is becoming less and less expensive.    </p>    <p>      Built in the 1940s for the 10th Mountain Division of the      U.S. Army, the huts were initially used to train American      troops for mountain combat in the Alps during World War II.      Each hut sleeps between 16 and 20 people and is about the      size of an average family home. Originally, fuel lanterns      and candles lit the huts, but as the number of recreational      visitors increased, disposal of hundreds of lantern-sized      propane tanks became problematic for the not-for-profit      10th Mountain Division Hut Association. When one of the      huts burned in a fire started by a candle, the organization      made the decision to install new lights. PV was not an      obvious choice, given backcountry skiers' interest in      preserving the pristine and rustic look of the remote but      system. The solar panel, though efficient, is certainly not      rustic-looking. But in the end, practicality won out over      aesthetics.    </p>    <p>      Instructors Johnny Weiss and Ken Olson of Solar Energy      International (SEI), a nonprofit, renewable energy      education and training organization, designed a system for      the huts that is able to endure severe conditions, but is      otherwise not so different from any other solar power      system.    </p>    <p>      "The only real difference is in the voltage," says Scott      Ely of SunSense, a one-man solar installation company based      in Snowmass, Colorado, that has an ongoing maintenance      contract with the Hut Association. "When the cells are hot,      they lose voltage." In other words, desert systems need      higher voltage panels than cold weather systems do.    </p>    <p>      The 10th Mountain system relies on one to six panels per      hut. Originally, the huts were for winter use only; so      SunSense, along with SEI students and instructors, mounted      panels flush with the side of the house. (SEI has kept its      students involved in the solar but project, using upgrades      and maintenance as teaching opportunities.)    </p>    <p>      The original panel installations worked well with snow      reflection and low winter sun. But now the huts have been      given U.S. Forest Service permits for summer use, and so      the panels are being retrofitted and mounted on poles to      accommodate the higher summer sun angle.    </p>    <p>      When it became apparent that the panels needed to be      retrofitted, 10th Mountain considered some other      alternative energy options, including wind mills. But      again, consideration for the quiet beauty of the area      brought them away from noisy wind generators and back to      quieter solar.    </p>        <h3>      Batteries & Lights    </h3>    <p>      The huts get the heaviest use during periods of least sun      and when the batteries, which are deep-cycle golf-cart      models, are the coldest. Most of the huts use lead-acid      batteries, though two systems use ni-cads and nickel irons.      The batteries are stored inside the huts or inside adjacent      storage rooms.    </p>    <p>      When 10th Mountain installed the lights, which are the only      appliances in the huts (heat comes from woodstoves), it      chose to place compact fluorescent lights in lanterns.      Interestingly, the compact floures cents are now being      replaced with 12-volt incandescent low-wattage bulbs in      lanterns. Because of the high energy efficiency of the      compact fluorescent, this change may be seen in the      renewable energy community as a technological step      backward. Ely defends the decision, however, saying the      incandes cents eliminate a ballast that comes with      low-wattage floures cents. The floures cents are also more      expensive in the short run and, despite what manufacturers      are touting as the new softer and dimmable fluorescent, the      fact remains that the quality of light is better with      incandes cents. But most important for these circumstances,      claims Ely, the incandes cents guarantee fewer cold-weather      start-up problems.    </p>        <h3>      Cost & Maintenance    </h3>    <p>      Ely estimates that the cost of complete solar installation      ranged from $5,000 to $8,000 per hut. Installing a similar      system on a home could be comparable. "We do this all the      time for remote homes," Ely says. Installing this system on      a home, however, would require the addition of an inverter      to transform DC into AC for AC appliances (the mountain      huts use only DC). Ely says the cost of the inverter would      bump up the installation price by a few thousand dollars.    </p>    <p>      To maintain the system, SunSense visits the huts twice a      year to tighten connections, add water, and equalize      batteries. Occasional upgrades have involved moving battery      boxes around to better locations, installing summertime      panels, changing bulbs from compact fluores cents to      incandes cents, and, most significantly, changing the power      centers. Ely says for safety reasons all the huts were      retrofitted with Anaconda power centers, which allow      everything-meters, breakers, etc.-to be centrally located      in one box. The cost, he adds, is less than $10 a year per      but to maintain the system (not including upgrades).    </p>    <p>      What this extreme experiment has shown, notes Weiss, is      that harsh conditions do not detract from the easy,      low-cost maintenance of solar. "There are no moving parts      in this technology," he explains. "Nothing wears out. It's      simply moving electrons."    </p>    <p>      One of the benefits of the mountain huts' power system is      that it has helped popularize the technology. Says Weiss,      "We've certainly seen it become very much mainstream. This      is not backwoods technology anymore; there's no longer      anything experimental about it. It's the same kind of      technology that people put on their homes and cabins."      Weiss's solar students use the system for hands-on      learning, and thousands of skiers visit the huts each year.    </p>    <p>      "The public has to turn the system on and off and [so they]      see the components," notes Jarod Trow, head of operations      for the 10th Mountain Division Hut Association. "Underlying      this is the hope that people will take this experience back      home and [that it will] make them more energy conscious."    </p>    <p>      <em>To learn more about PV systems for extreme weather      conditions, or for information on the 10th Mountain      Division but system, contact:</em>    </p>    <p>      • <strong>SunSense Solar Electric Systems</strong> ,      P.O.
