                <p>      <em><strong>This issue's mini-manual will give you the      basics of a useful and decorative plant-raiser's      art</strong></em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Robert Kourik    </h5>    <p>      It started innocuously enough, when a small promotional      brochure an nouncing something called Designing and      Maintaining Your Edible Landscape-Naturally quietly wormed      its way, through mounds of unread material, to the top of      an unorganized staffer's desk. "Gee, " that unsuspecting      MOTHER said, "somebody's doing a book on edible      landscaping. I think I'll drop this Robert Kourik a line,      just to see if he knows what he's talking about. "    </p>    <p>      We soon received reams of computer-printed manuscript and      learned that Mr. Kourik was taking two years off from his      regular job to write what could turn out to be the most      comprehensive guide in existence to growing vegetables,      fruits, flowers, and herbs for both ornamental and culinary      purposes. Reading the draft quickly convinced us that      Robert did know his subject . . . quite well, in fact. And      how did he gain such hard-to-find knowledge? Why, from      seven years at that job he was taking a leave      from-namely, creating professionally designed edible      landscapes for homeowners!    </p>    <p>      When we finished Kourik's manuscript, we couldn't wait for      him to get his book into print . . . we wanted to share it      with you right away. So we hereby present some highlights      from that not yet published volume, Designing and      Maintaining Your Edible Landscape-Naturally. If      you've ever wanted some good advice on how to grow foods      that are tasty and ornamental at the same time, you'll find      it in the following excerpt.    </p>    <h3>      WHY EDIBLE LANDSCAPING?    </h3>    <p>      Roll back part of your lawn and renew the age-old tradition      of surrounding a home with a productive landscape. Edible      landscaping is a way to grow vegetables, berries, herbs,      fruits, nuts, and ornamental plants in attractive and      harmonious groupings, without the use of dangerous      chemicals. As you nurture your edible landscape, it will      sustain you and your family with benefits that go far      beyond good food.    </p>    <h3>      Pleasure . . .    </h3>    <p>      Many otherwise useful gardening books forget that you, the      gardener, are the most important living thing in the      garden. Often, they focus only on the plants, omitting the      ways you can garden with pleasure in a busy life. If      gardening isn't fun, why bother? Most of us aren't growing      food for survival. It shouldn't be a chore. Find pleasure      in your landscape; play with the plants. Experiment. Break      some of the rules. With each passing season, you will find      more beautiful and more fruitful ways for you and your      landscape to grow .    </p>    <h3>      . . . and Beauty    </h3>    <p>      I started experimenting early on with unusual gardening and      landscaping techniques, colorful vegetables, and exotic      food plants. My work-and the work of other      edible-landscapers-has begun to prove that landscapes      can be ornamental and tasty, colorful and useful.    </p>    <p>      When my landscape maintenance business first began, I took      care of completely ornamental landscapes. Over time, more      and more clients wanted vegetable gardens, but I noticed      that too often the vegetable garden was treated like a      second-class landscape, hidden away behind the dog pen or      garage.    </p>    <p>      I soon realized there is nothing second-class about food      plants, and that I could design and plant an edible and      gorgeous landscape. The beauty and variety of a      well-designed edible landscape really impress my clients      and their friends and visitors.    </p>    <p>      A good traditional ornamental landscape combines colors,      textures, smells, and sounds, but usually neglects flavors.      Your edible landscape will stimulate all the      senses-fragrant daylilies for the flower order that      can be used in salads or stuffed with herb cheeses, a      colorful ground cover of a variegated gold and green thyme      for soups and casseroles, a soft herbal sitting bench      planted with chamomile that can be harvested for tea, a      cool, relaxing arbor laden with the fruits of kiwi vines      and grapevines. The possibilities are endless.    </p>    <p>      There are hundreds of examples of food plants that add      color to your landscape:    </p>    <h3>      Vegetables . . .    </h3>    <p>      Ornamental kale provides a spectacular display of fall and      spring color, and it has the same taste as garden kale. In      the photograph on page 40, the ornamental kale is planted      among lettuce for a beautiful contrast in color and form.    </p>    <p>      Ruby chard, `Romanesco' broccoli, nasturtiums, and      `Radicchio' (an Italian red-leaved chicory) are all true      ornamentals, and they're edible too.    </p>    <p>      Liberated from the conventional garden, colorful vegetables      have a place in the edible landscape .    </p>    <h3>      . . . and Perennial Edibles    </h3>    <p>      There are many perennial edibles that have as much color as      ornamentals.    </p>    <p>      The silver-grey highlights of artichokes and the bold      pattern of their leaves are as dramatic a show as any plant      makes.    </p>    <p>      The fiery fall colors of an Oriental chestnut <em>(Castanea      mollissima)</em> , Asian pear <em>(Pyrus pyrifolia)</em> ,      cherry <em>(Prunus avium)</em> , or peach <em>(Prunus      persica)</em> are as impressive as those of virtually any      ornamental shade tree.    </p>    <p>      Ripe Oriental persimmons <em>(Diospyros kaki)</em> hanging      on the bare branches of a fog-shrouded tree are indeed a      magical sight. The glossy green leaves and spectacular fall      color add their highlights in season.    </p>    <p>      If you like the formal look, both rosemary <em>(Rosmarinus      officinalis)</em> and the silver-grey-leaved pineapple      guava (Feijoa sellowiana-for warm-winter climates)      are easily sheared to almost any form. The genetic dwarf      peaches and nectarines are well behaved, dense, shrublike      fruit trees. The hot pink, double flowers of the genetic      dwarf `Garden Beauty' nectarine are some of the most      dazzling to be found.    </p>    <p>      An edible landscape can be small, but elegant and      picturesque. Consider the appeal of the landscape planted      by Helen Malcolm-Neeb near Big Sur, California. A radiant      mixture of colorful red chard, two kinds of lettuce,      narrow-leaved chives, and edible violas mingles with the      ornamental blossoms of alyssum. All are arranged,      reminiscent of a flower bouquet, beneath a young miniature      `Garden Prince' almond, which displays a delicate pink      blossom each spring.    </p>    <p>      It's time for the prejudice against edibles as ornamentals      to wither and be replaced by the respect they deserve as      landscape plants.    </p>    <h3>      Taste Appeal    </h3>    <p>      My garden is beautiful, but it is also for flavor.      Different, better tastes. The kind of flavor no grocery      store could possibly offer.    </p>    <p>      Homegrown tastes best. My reason for starting to garden was      to have those homegrown tastes no money can buy. A      store-bought `Granny Smith' apple is good, but one      fresh-picked from the tree and fully ripe is superb.    </p>
