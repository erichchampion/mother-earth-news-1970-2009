                <p>      <em>You don't have to anticipate facing a foe namied      Goliath to enjoy taking a whirl at . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by Lynn P. Ballard    </h5>        <p>      I learned about the hand sling back in my boyhood and spent      many enjoyable hours using one to hurl river rocks at tin      cans. Since that time, I've never lost my fascination with      the power and accuracy of this primitive device.    </p>    <p>      The biblical account of David's courage and miraculous      victory over the giant Goliath is about all most of us know      of the history of the sling. But the little weapon was      invented long before that legendary encounter. In fact,      it's been known in many parts of the world since the      Neolithic (late Stone Age) period, and quite possibly since      the latter part of the Paleolithic. Early slings were most      often made of rawhide or the "well-twisted wool" mentioned      by Homer in the <em>Iliad</em> .    </p>    <p>      The sling was an important weapon to many ancient armies.      In the classical Greek period, for instance, stingers and      archers often supported the infantry by attacking at long      range to expose weaknesses in the enemy's line - and      a skilled slinger was considered a match for a bowman in      both range and effectiveness.    </p>    <p>      Much later, Hernando Cortés, in his bloody march to      the Aztec capital of Mexico, found the native defenders      formidably armed with hand slings. And even as recently as      the seventeenth century, the grenadiers of some European      armies were using the sling as a weapon.    </p>    <p>      The traditional hand sling missile is a smooth stone      roughly the size and shape of a small egg. But the sling      held such great importance for some armies that they      employed workers to manufacture molded lead and sunhardened      clay missiles. This uniform ammunition allowed their      slingers to enjoy greater, and more consistent, range and      accuracy. (Archaeologists unfamiliar with the history of      the sling have sometimes been puzzled by finds of small      clay or lead "eggs," not realizing that they were      stockpiles of sling ammunition. These carefully      manufactured projectiles often carried inscriptions      equivalent to the English "Take that!" or "Ouch!")    </p>    <p>      Naturally, the sling was eventually supplanted by gunpowder      and is now largely forgotten as a weapon - except by      a few tribal herdsmen who still use the primitive device to      scare of predators.    </p>    <p>      Today the sling seems best suited to the high purpose of      providing low-cost recreation. Besides being easy (and very      inexpensive) to construct, slings can be grand fun,      especially once you develop a reasonable degree of accuracy      . . . something that most people can accomplish with less      than an hour's practice!    </p>    <h3>      MANUFACTURING A SLING    </h3>        <p>      My version of the hand sling is made by binding a couple of      lengths of 1/8"-diameter nylon line to a leather pocket.      That's about all there is to it.    </p>    <p>      Start by scrounging up - for the sling's pocket      - a tough but pliable piece of leather (such as the      tongue from an old boot) that measures 6" X 2-1/2" or      thereabouts. Trim the hide to an oval shape and punch a      vertically centered hole about 1/2" in from each end. Now      cut two pieces of nylon cord - one 28" long, the      other measuring 32".    </p>    <p>      Assemble the parts by threading an end of one of the pieces      of cord through one of the holes in the leather pocket,      pulling about an inch of the cord through and looping it      back on itself. Then bind the loop by wrapping it tightly      with string; kite string is perfect for this. (Have a      friend hold the cord while you wrap and tie the string.)      Repeat the above procedure to attach the second length of      cord to the other end of the leather pocket.    </p>    <p>      Next, form a finger loop at the free end of the      <em>longer</em> cord. Make the loop just large enough for      your middle finger to slip into and out of easily. Then      wrap string around the two sections of cord that form the      loop, extending the winding back about an inch from the      base of the loop.    </p>    <p>      Now fold the pocket in half, with the rough side of the      leather facing out, and stretch the sling out full length      so that the two cords are lying side by side. Tie a small,      hard knot near the end of the unlooped cord, so that the      knot is even with the end of the looped cord.    </p>    <p>      Finish up by melting all four exposed ends of nylon cord      (to prevent unraveling) with a match, lighter, or candle      - then coat the string windings generously with      Elmer's Glue-All to protect them from abrasion.    </p>		    <h3>      CASTING THE FIRST STONE    </h3>    <p>      Ancient slingers had a variety of throwing techniques,      including both underhanded and overhanded vertical swings,      as well as whirling the sling either horizontally or at an      angle over the head. While most of these styles of casting      work well with practice, the simplest and - for me      - most effective sling technique is an overhand      "baseball throw."    </p>    <p>      To practice, first find an open throwing area with no      people or animals nearby that might be struck by a stray      missile. Hook the middle finger of your throwing hand      through the looped cord and pinch the knot of the other      cord between the thumb and forefinger of the same hand.      Load the sling by placing a rounded stone no larger than a      golf ball in the center of the pocket. [EDITOR'S NOTE: In      testing a sling made according to Mr. Ballard's      instructions, we found that, up to a point, the larger the      stone, the easier it was to control the cast. In fact, we      attained good results with some stones that were      considerably larger than a golf ball.]    </p>    <p>      Now, with your free hand, grasp the loaded pocket and lift      it toward the target as if aiming; turn your body about      90° away from the target, and sight over the top of      your extended hand. Keep your feet together, your throwing;      hand close against your chest, and your eyes on the target.    </p>    <p>      To make a throw, drop the loaded sling and draw your      throwing hand slightly downward to start the orbiting      motion. The sling must fall in front of you and then be      lifted upward and back in a wide vertical arc beside your      body. On the first spin, let your throwing arm rise high      behind you and then fall just to the rear of your head as      you begin a "pitcher's step" with your leading foot. (By      decreasing the size of the arc in this manner, you'll be      increasing the velocity of the sling.) As the stone reaches      the top of its second orbit, throw it as you would a      baseball, releasing the knotted cord as your leading foot      completes the pitcher's step and your wrist snaps forward.    </p>    <p>      The missile should fly in a low arc toward the target. If      it doesn't, examine your form and try again. Bear in mind      that the entire throwing process should consist of one      continuous movement. With practice, you'll learn to sense      when the stone is in the right position to be released, and      your timing will improve. In effect, each stone will "tell"      you when to release it by its weight and speed.    </p>    <p>      Don't, however, expect every throw to be right on target .      . . or, at first, even under control. But once you get the      technique down, the majority of your throws will sail      straight and true. (And don't hesitate to experiment with      other techniques until you find the one that best suits      <em>you</em> .)    </p>    <p>      Because of their aerodynamic shape, rounded stones make the      best projectiles - they spin out efficiently and      retain their energy longer. (Misshapen missiles will      sometimes buzz or sing as they wobble away in a curve or      spiral.) The nearest creek or gravel bed should supply all      the ammo you can carry away.    </p>    <p>      In the hands of an expert, a sling-thrown stone's initial      velocity can exceed 60 miles per hour, with long-distance      casts of 250 <em>yards</em> not uncommon. So, since wild      throws are frequent at first, please <em>be careful</em> !    </p>    <p>      Because the sling was invented to enable ancient hunters      and warriors to strike disabling blows at long distances,      it's classified in the history of technology as a weapon.      But if swords can become plowshares, perhaps the sling,      too, has a peaceful future. To me, the contemporary value      of this ancient tool lies in the pleasure of feeling its      remarkable efficiency in my own hands.    </p>
