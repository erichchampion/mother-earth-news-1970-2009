                <p>      <em><strong>"Nothing helps scenery like ham and      eggs."-Mark Twain</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Although some of this author's suggestions may go "against      the grain" of our more nutrition-conscious readers, his      article contains information that should help anyone plan      and prepare better and less expensive camp meals . . . even      if Mr. Coburn does hint at a fondness for-heaven help      us!-fruit-flavored "chocolate" chips.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Mark D. Coburn    </h5>    <p>      The main thing I ask of trail food is that it taste good. I      don't object to sound nutrition, but-after a day of      hiking-flavor comes first. I'll admit I'm      opinionated, but there's no room around my campfire for      folks who think textured vegetable protein tastes "almost      like beef," or that carob bears any more resemblance to      Tobler's chocolate than I do to Burt Reynolds.    </p>    <p>      But personal preference aside, there are many factors that      have to be taken into consideration when deciding which      foods to pack along on a hike. In addition to palatability,      you must think about heft and bulk, ease of preparation,      and-the Big One-cost. In an effort to weigh all      those variables and come up with the best backpacking meals      for the least expense, let's begin by surveying the      different products offered by the purveyors of specialty      camp foods.    </p>    <h3>      FOODS    </h3>    <p>      Freeze-dried foods-let's admit it-aren't all      bad. Orange and grapefruit juice crystals, for example, are      usually tastier than Tang. And some of these packaged      dinners even taste sort of like food. Furthermore, there      are times when freeze-dried meals offer some real      advantages: For winter treks, preparation speed alone is      reason enough to opt for this sort of grub; and on hikes      lasting more than, say, ten nights, every ounce of weight      you can save will likely be considered cheap at any price.    </p>    <p>      Of course, most of the average backpacker's outings don't      last ten nights. And it's extravagant to eat      expedition-style when the trip could be provisioned better,      and less expensively, from your pantry and the supermarket.    </p>    <p>      Retort meals are a newer wrinkle. Initially developed for      the long-distance outings of NASA astronauts, these meals      are precooked main courses, sealed in foil pouches, that      keep without refrigeration. To prepare a retort meal, you      simply dunk the pouch(es) in boiling water for about five      minutes. Retort food is easier to prepare, requires no      utensils other than a spoon or fork (if you don't mind      eating out of a pouch), has better texture, and retains      more nutrients than freeze-dried food. On the other hand,      it's heavier, and one portion isn't much of a feast for      most outdoor appetites.    </p>    <p>      I've tried several offerings each from two of the leaders      in the field-Kraft a la Carte and Yurika brands.      Kraft's retort meals weigh in at a uniform 9.4 ounces,      which includes a starch in a separate, water-permeable      pouch (picture a big tea bag full of rice or noodles). They      cost $2.07 at my neighborhood supermarket. Yurika's main      dishes weigh 7.5 to 10 ounces each and cost $3.25 at my      local camper's supply outlet.    </p>    <p>      Kraft's retort dishes not only are less expensive than      Yurika's but, I think, are better seasoned, as well. They      certainly have better texture. For example, the water      chestnuts in Kraft's sweet-and-sour chicken have real      crunch, while I can seldom tell where Yurika's vegetables      end and the sauce begins.    </p>    <p>      Overall, then, I vote for Kraft over Yurika, for retort      meals over freeze-dried . . . and for moving on to more      tasteful subjects.    </p>    <p>      Let's review a hiker's typical eating day. Think of this as      the outline you'll be filling in as you plan and shop for      trail meals.    </p>    <h3>      BREAKFAST    </h3>    <p>      When a long hike is pending and you're eager to break camp      and hit the trail, preparation and cleanup time usually      limit breakfast options. For an appetizer there's dried      fruit, dried fruit rehydrated overnight, or juice from      crystals. For a main course you can choose either      quick-cooking (or presoaked) hot cereal, cold cereal, or      something from the granola-bar family. For a hot beverage      you have about the same choices as at home.    </p>    <p>      On days to be spent in camp (or when short hikes permit      late starts), there's time for slow-cooking cereals,      pancakes, or biscuits. Since most hikers prefer death to      powdered eggs, many take enough fresh eggs and bacon for      the first few days.    </p>    <h3>      LUNCH    </h3>    <p>      There are two schools of thought concerning on-the-trail      lunching: One school advocates nibbling off and on all day      rather than eating a "real" lunch, while the other prefers      taking a lunch break as well as nibbling off and on all      day.    </p>    <p>      Most lunchers have yet to find anything better (or lighter)      than no-cook meats such as salami and sardines complemented      by cheese and crackers or bread-unless it's peanut butter      and crackers. Popular luncheon desserts include nuts,      candy, cookies, dried fruit, or gorp (trail mix). Beverages      include water. For reasons that baffle culinary      psychologists, most hikers tire less of these simple menus      than of all camp dinners combined.    </p>    <p>      While some backpacking books advocate a soup lunch, I have      rarely seen anyone preparing a cooked midday meal in      summer. Doing so would just involve too much fuss. Winter      is another story, though. Even folks who limit      cross-country ski treks to one day find that midday soup      (or at least a hot drink) is worth the trouble.    </p>    <h3>      DINNER    </h3>    <p>      Most respectable camp dinners start with soup and end with      a simple dessert and a beverage. The soup brightens spirits      and holds starvation at bay while the main course is      cooking. Soup also helps hikers replenish their body      fluids-which is especially important in parts of the West,      where the typically dry air evaporates body moisture      rapidly.    </p>    <p>      Viewed broadly, main courses follow a single pattern: An      expandable, fast-cooking starch is blended with (or served      under) a mixture of meat and such enhancements as      vegetables, sauces, spices, and toppings.    </p>    <p>      In fact, you can map out a main-course planner on one page.      Split the sheet into three or four columns. Head one column      "Starches" and another "Meats." Either lump the rest      together as "Flavorings" or give "Vegetables" a separate      column. If you can list ten items in each of three columns,      you'll have 1,000 combinations, not counting those that use      two foods from the same column. Of course, many of these      wheel-of-fortune combos will be real gaggers (imagine      fried-rice-style Rice-A-Roni with tuna and chili powder),      but you'll also have hundreds of real possibilities.    </p>    <p>      Dinner desserts include the lunch varieties, plus instant      puddings and other easily prepared sweets (such as no-bake      cheesecake).    </p>    <p>      Notice that I've not presented any detailed menus, but only      broad guidelines for getting better-and      better-tasting-backpacking meals for your money.      Along the same lines, I offer the following nine hints for      planning better, cheaper trail meals.    </p>    <h3>      HINT 1: ANALYZE YOUR TRIP    </h3>    <p>      Every outing presents its own culinary opportunities and      limitations. Smart cooks plan precisely-day by day,      meal by meal-for the trip at hand. So before you      shop, ask yourself questions like these:    </p>    <p>      <em>How many days?</em> If several strong backs will be      dividing the load for a weekend trip, you needn't worry      much about weight. (You could probably haul cast-iron pots      without undue strain.) On the other hand, on summer      one-nighters I often go without a fire. I simply dine on      no-cook foods and streamchilled beer, and wake myself up      with a walk instead of caffeine.    </p>    <p>      Nutritional balance is important on long trips (you may      even want to include vitamin pills). But for short outings,      diet is a matter of choice; after all, you could survive      three days on nothing but Fritos and water without      seriously threatening your health-though I can't      imagine anyone wanting to.    </p>    <p>      Unless every ounce counts, carry enough fresh foods for the      first day or two on the trail. Frozen steaks will thaw as      you hike. Carrots and other sturdy vegetables will keep      fine for the second day's lunch. So will hard-boiled eggs.      In your pack's cool center, leftover home-cooked meat      should keep well for the second night's dinner. Tightly      wrapped smoked ham should keep until the third night or      longer.    </p>    <p>      <em>Will you have lazy days in camp? Will you build      fires?</em> Foods that need lengthy soaking before or      during cooking (beans, lentils, regular brown rice, etc.)      are fine for in-camp days and wood fires-but      they won't do for fast meals after hikes or for trips when      you must carry and ration stove fuel.    </p>    <p>      <em>Will you be cooking at high altitudes?</em> If the      answer is yes, then forget about dining on anything      requiring beans, because the dried legumes simply won't      rehydrate. The higher you climb, the more slowly      <em>all</em> starches and cereals will cook. And because of      the lower temperatures at high altitudes, cereals left to      soak overnight may turn into whole-grain      Popsicles-even in summer.    </p>    <p>      <em>Will water be in short supply?</em> If so, choose your      dinner starches from among those that require little more      liquid for cooking than the small amount they'll absorb.      Forget pasta.    </p>    <p>      <em>How about wild foods?</em> If you're in an area that      lends itself to foraging, a copy of Lee Peterson's      <em>A</em> <em>Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants</em>      (Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 1978) and a break-down      spinning or fly rod can be worth three times their weight      in processed and packaged meat and vegetables. Of course,      don't ever eat a plant if you have the least doubt about      its identity. (After a few seasons' worth of foraging      experience, you'll probably have enough <em>sure</em>      identifications locked in your head to make the book      optional.)    </p>    <h3>      HINT 2: LOOT YOUR LARDER    </h3>        <p>      A backpacking trip is the perfect time to make use of      home-dried garden produce. De hydrated vegetables will      glorify any trail dinner (most hikers come home craving      green stuff). Hiking also presents a good opportunity to      use such homemade treats as jerky, your pet granola mix,      candies, and sturdy cookies. (A tip on packing homemade      granola bars: Overbake them a little. Crispier bars are      lighter and hold up better in jouncing packs.)    </p>    <p>      Be sure to prepare your own gorp; store blends always leave      out at least one thing you love. But keep in mind that a      trail mix you enjoy at home may be lousy for the trail: I      like sunflower seeds, but I don't like the way they jiggle      down to the bottom of the gorp bag during a hike.    </p>    <p>      And (again) remember that on short trips you can tote      heavier food. I know a cook who is famed for her Spaghetti      à la Backpack. Her sauce tastes home-canned . . .      because it is. In camp, she produces it from the one Mason      jar she totes along on each trip. (On other jaunts, the jar      might hold a whole deboned chicken.)    </p>    <h3>      HINT 3: NEVER PAY BOUTIQUE PRICES FOR MARKET FOOD    </h3>    <p>      There are two differences between the Mountain Macho      Backpacker Blend-type soup mixes sold at      camping-specialty outlets and Knorr-type supermarket soup      mixes: [1] Knorr tastes better, and [2] Knorr is cheaper.      Likewise, no Packer Cracker from the camping boutique is      better than Triscuits. (IBM is said to be doing research to      determine why Triscuits break so little when slept on.) And      no designer-priced Camper Cookies are as tasty as      plain-Jane Oreos . . . let alone Pepperidge Farm . .      . let alone homemade.    </p>    <p>      And if circumstances demand that any meat you carry be      freeze-dried, you can still save money by buying only the      meat and adding your own starches and flavorings.    </p>    <h3>      HINT 4: TREAT YOURSELF KINDLY    </h3>        <p>      When Colin Fletcher ambled the length of Grand Canyon, each      of his air-dropped food packets included one gourmet goody.      Take a lesson from <em>The Man Who Walked Through      Time,</em> and pamper your own wilderness stomach.      Remember-almost anything short of caviar is a bargain      when compared with freeze-dried grub.    </p>    <p>      To stave off culinary boredom, carry the best meat you can      afford. If I know I'll have to lunch all week on salami, it      will be the tastiest Italian variety I can find. And my      cheese sure won't be processed American when it can be      provolone or New York cheddar.    </p>    <p>      You can splurge on beverages and still not spend a lot.      Instant tea doesn't belong in camp, because it tastes      nasty; carrying your favorite bagged tea won't sprain your      shoulders. Since brewed coffee is usually too much trouble,      treat yourself to good instant coffee-your pet brand,      a gourmet type you've been hankering to sample, or even one      of the continental-style flavored coffee mixes.    </p>    <p>      And while you're blending your gorp, why not make it a gorp      fit for royalty? (You never know whom you'll meet out      there.) At home I eat peanuts When l'm making trail gorp, I      buy cashews.    </p>    <h3>      HINT 5: TWO CAUTIONS    </h3>    <p>      Before you hasten off to turn the hood grocery store into      your safari supplier, two warnings are in order:    </p>    <p>      <em>Read labels carefully.</em> Be sure the cookie, time      won't take more fuel than you can span And check those      "just add" ingredients: Any thing that says "just add two      eggs" is a bad ; bet if you're going to be five days from      the nearest hen (unless you know for a fact that the eggs      aren't essential). Brand difference, matter, too: Some      brands of "quick" rice are quicker than others; some      gingerbread mixes <em>don't</em> need an egg.    </p>    <p>      <em>Perform your big experiments at home, not on the      trail.</em> Don't attempt your very first cake in a      fireside reflector oven. Likewise, if you're a Mexican-food      innocent, don't plan to have your first brush with jalapeno      destiny halfway up Mt. Whitney.    </p>    <h3>      HINT 6: KEEP IN MIND WHAT YOU'RE SHOPPING FOR    </h3>    <p>      Backpacking demands lightweight foods that taste good, keep      without refrigeration, are quick and easy to prepare, and      dirty a minimum of utensils. Consider only those realities,      and forget any notions about "what backpackers eat."    </p>    <p>      It's all a matter of attitude. For instance, the person      seeking trail food finds little good bread. So much of it      is bulky, crushes easily, and goes stale fast. But the      alert shopper heads for the delicous section and finds lots      of cocktail ryes and firm, European-style pumpernickels.      Such breads are ideal pack fare. But to even consider them,      your mind's eye must be focused to see that "party food"      can also be camp food.    </p>    <p>      Search the supermarket for light, quick-fix foods that keep      well. Ask yourself how long each dairy product will hold      up. Hard cheeses keep better than soft, but a wax coating      or foil wrap matters more than the type of cheese. If you      bake, try using powdered buttermilk.    </p>    <p>      What about condensed mincemeat for desserts? If you've got      the space, how about popcorn balls? And remember that      "chocolate" chips come in butterscotch, peanut butter, and      fruit flavors, too.    </p>    <p>      Notice <em>all</em> the canned meats, gourmet varieties      included. Summer sausage (often sold as "beef stick") keeps      well. So does pepperoni, and a few ounces of it will ignite      lots of spaghetti. Salami that's left over from lunch can      also be used to add zest to pasta dishes.    </p>    <p>      After you've scoured the grocery, take your well-sharpened      eyes to health food and gourmet stores, and even ethnic      food shops. (One small-town-based backpack chef I know will      endure a day in the Big City just to raid a certain Chinese      market's treasury of dried mushrooms and seafoods.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, <em>keep</em> your eyes peeled. Wise old camp      cooks are ever alert. Even when browsing through cheese      catalogs for possible Christmas gifts, they pounce on      anything that might jazz up next summer's camp cooking.    </p>    <h3>      HINT 7: WELCOME TO STARCH TREK    </h3>    <p>      For the frequent packer, the discovery of one new      <em>starch</em> is more blessed than three other finds. The      pasta and rice, Hamburger Helper, and dried-potato sections      are only the first places in the supermarket to look. Did      you remember Japanese ramen and Chinese chow mein noodles?      Quick-cooking barley?    </p>    <p>      A friend steered me to couscous-semolina wheat in      granular pasta form. The Near East brand is ready to eat in      five minutes. Look for it in the gourmet section. (And      while you're there, look for spaetzle-little German      noodles.)    </p>    <p>      Health food stores are laden with pastas and grains. I'm      addicted to bulgur (parched cracked wheat); perhaps you      feel the same about <em>kasha</em> (buckwheat groats) or      millet.    </p>    <p>      For fun, see if you can find one starch that isn't in any      obvious store section. (My friend with the Mason jar      sometimes goes camping with Stove Top stuffing mix. Why      didn't I think of that?)    </p>    <h3>      HINT 8: SPICE IT!    </h3>    <p>      Seasonings are the lightest trail foods and among the most      versatile. A clever seasoner can overcome many of the pack      kitchen's limitations. (For instance, when preparing soups,      a few dried mushrooms and a sprinkle of marjoram can make      quite a difference.)    </p>    <p>      Seasonings also include bacon bits and other salad      toppings; poppy, sesame, and other seeds; flavored crumbs      and croutons; bouillon cubes and soup mixes; and all those      foil packets of sauce mixes, taco spices, marinades, and      gravies.    </p>    <p>      Grated Parmesan (or Romano) cheese is a superb trail food.      It travels perfectly for weeks and will drive the drab out      of countless main courses and soups.    </p>    <p>      Another must-have seasoning is Squeeze Parkay (or a similar      liquid margarine). Many main courses require some form of      oil, and most can use a bit of a flavor boost, too.    </p>    <p>      Dessert? No one ever called instant chocolate pudding the      high point of a gourmet meal, but it's better when you add      malted milk powder or, perhaps, a little instant coffee.    </p>    <p>      Drinks? Try cinnamon or another sweet spice in tea, coffee,      or cider mix. Take miniature marshmallows for cocoa.    </p>    <p>      Breakfast? If you've brought along instant oatmeal that's      been "customized" and prepackaged with chopped dates,      banana chips, raisins, brown sugar, and powdered milk,      you'll have a cereal worth crawling out of the sleeping bag      for.    </p>    <h3>      HINT 9: BE ADAPTABLE    </h3>    <p>      When you select foods that will allow you to eat a whole      dinner from a Sierra cup, you're making a sensible      adjustment to camp dining. Keep looking around for other      smart adaptations.    </p>    <p>      Try presoaking grains and hot cereals. For dinner, you      needn't cook bulgur at all. Instead, make tabouli salad by      mixing bulgur with dried vegetables and spices, pouring      boiling water on top, and letting it sit for an hour.    </p>    <p>      Never reject a food idea because you won't be able to add      some suggested frill, such as browning the dish on top      after it's cooked. And unless the idea of pressing graham      cracker crumbs into the bottom of your Sierra cup excites      you, spread the crust mix over your no-bake cheesecake.    </p>    <p>      If you don't like messing with a reflector oven, keep in      mind that many baked goods can be prepared pancake-style in      a skillet. (So what if your gingerbread comes out looking      weird? You want it to taste good, not to grace the cover of      Bon Appetit.)    </p>    <h3>      JUST LIKE HOME COOKING? DREAM ON!    </h3>    <p>      Show me folks who swear they eat better on the trail than      at home, and I'll show you folks whose dinner invitations      you'll want to decline. The cold reality of trail eating is      that a camp stove is not a range, a backpack is not a      refrigerator, and science has yet to find a way to      dehydrate Caesar salad, leg of lamb, or bourbon on the      rocks.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, by planning carefully and shopping      creatively, you can make your camp meals more enjoyable to      prepare and eat, you'll have extra traveling money jingling      in your hiking shorts . . . and the camping boutiques and      designer trail-food manufacturers will be left holding the      foil bags.    </p>
