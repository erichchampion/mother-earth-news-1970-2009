                      <p><strong>MAY JUNE</strong></p>    <p>      Winter's cold is long past, early      spring showers have moistened      the soil, and sunny days grace      the garden. This is nature's most exciting time, as      miracles of      germination and growth occur daily. Let growing concerns      cast care      aside!    </p>    <hr />    <h2 id="subtitle">      Seed-Savers Alert    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by Peter Hemingson    </h5>        <p>      If you're interested in the preservation of heritage      varieties of vegetables, mark the dates October 4-6 on your      calendar, because on that long weekend the National      Association for Gardening will hold a conference on the      topic at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis.      According to the February issue of <em>Gardens for All</em>      (the association's monthly magazine, available with      membership for $15 a year), the purposes of the conference      are twofold: to help improve our understanding of how to      locate and save seeds of heirloom varieties, and to help      dramatize the necessity for preserving genetically diverse      seed stocks. To receive additional information about the      conference, write to Kit Anderson at Gardens for All, 180      Flynn Ave., Burlington, VT 05401. To join the association,      send $15 to GFA Member Subscription Service, Depot Square,      Peterborough, NH 03458. And if you want access to sources      of heirloom varieties, be sure to join Kent Whealy's Seed      Savers Exchange (203 Rural Ave., Decorah, IA 52101; $10 a      year . . . and well worth it!).    </p>    <h3>      GARDEN COMPETITIONS    </h3>    <p>      Let's assume you've already entered your 1985 garden design      in MOTHER'S contest for the best individual or family-size      food garden (see page 93 in MOTHER N0. 92 for the      announcement and page 5 in this issue for an update).      What's that? You've got more to share? A community garden?      Well, you're in luck: There's still time to enter your      community garden in the American Community Gardening      Association/Glad Wrap contest. The grand prize is $1,500. .      .and that'll buy a lot of seeds! Information about the      competition is available from AC GA, P.O. Box 93147,      Milwaukee, WI 53202 - but hurry: Entries close on      June 1. The winning gardens will be announced at the annual      meeting of the ACGA, to be held in New York City, October      13-18. (If, by the way, you're a professional      community-garden-program leader, you might want to consider      affiliating with the association. Call John Royal or Steve      Brackman for details at 414/224-4854. Information on the      annual meeting agenda is available from Tom Fox,      Neighborhood Open Space Coalition, 72 Reade St., New York,      NY 10007, 212/513 - 7555.)    </p>    <h3>      SALADS ALL SUMMER    </h3>    <p>      Like most MOTHER readers, I know that the secret to      summer-long salad makings is succession planting, but all      too often I've found that knowledge and practice donor      coincide, particularly when I've had trouble ferreting out      bolt-resistant lettuce varieties to raise during the hotter      months. Help, however, is at hand. I've just received a      catalog from The Cook's Garden (P.O. Box 65060,      Londonderry, VT 05148) that's stuffed with salad makers,      including 30 kinds of lettuce . . .with five that are ideal      for hot weather. There's Craquerelle du Midi, a      Buttercrunch type that also stands up to frost . . .      Kinemontpas, another butterhead imported from France . . .      Little Gem, a semi-cos variety . . . Ballon, a French      romaine . . . and to add a little color to our lives,      there's Continuity, a butterhead with purplish red leaves.      And looking ahead, the catalog lists six varieties for      overwintering. Ellen and Shepherd Ogden started their seed      business as a spin-off from their market-gardening      operation, so you know the seeds have been tested and the      descriptions of the plants are accurate. <em>Bon      appétit</em> !    </p>    <h3>      TOMATOES OF NOTE    </h3>    <p>      Single-season gardeners may have their tomato seedlings      well under way, but our southern friends can look forward      to a fall crop of succulent 'maters, too. One seed catalog      that's new this year comes free from Tomato Growers Supply      Company (P.O. Box 2237, Ft. Myers, FL 33902), which      features 112 different varieties - everything from      old-timers such as Oxheart and nonhybrid Rutgers to such      All-America selections as Celebrity.    </p>    <p>      Finally (and improbable as it may seem), a small Canadian      seed house may have something of interest to gardeners in      the Deep South: Siberia, a tomato that actually sets fruit      in temperatures as chilly as 38°! If you're in the      South, consider Siberia as a winter crop. If you live in      the North, flag this for trial next spring for extra-early      tomatoes. A 25-seed packet is $1.50 (U.S. funds) from      Siberia Seeds, Box 3000, Olds, Alta., Canada T0M 1P0.    </p>
