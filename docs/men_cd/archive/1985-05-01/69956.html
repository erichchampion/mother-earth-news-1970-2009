Bahr    </h5>        <p>      Despite its name, climbing okra <em>(Luffa acutangula)</em>      isn't an okra at all. Rather, it's been tagged with that      misleading moniker because of its superficial resemblance      to garden okra.    </p>    <p>      So, just what is climbing okra, if okra it ain't? It's an      edible gourd, a kissing cousin to the loofah (Luffa      cylindrica). And, since all Luffa varieties belong to the      family Cucurbitaceae, climbing okra is actually kin to the      common cucumber.    </p>    <p>      Climbing okra is a vigorous vine that uses its long      tendrils to cling to supporting structures such as      trellises and fences. Depending on soil quality and related      growing conditions, this plant's runners can reach 6' to      20' in length, quickly covering its support with a lush      canopy of large, dark green leaves. (In warm, moist regions      it's sometimes necessary to control the vine's rampant      growth by pinching off the tips of runners.)    </p>    <p>      Luffa acutangula begins producing flowers well before      reaching maturity. Blooms are 2-1/2" to 3-1/2" in diameter      and resemble butter yellow thunbergia flowers. The blossoms      open late in the afternoon and remain open all night. At      twilight the flowers almost seem to glow, exuding a sweet      fragrance that's ir resistible to moths and late-shift      bees. Male and female blooms grow on separate stalks and      are easy to tell apart: The males stand out from the      foliage on elongated stalks; female flowers hug the stems      and are backed by immature fruit.    </p>    <h3>      A MULTITUDE OF USES FOR THE OKRA THAT AIN'T    </h3>        <p>      Once your climbing okra begins to bloom, it's time for you      to keep a sharp eye out for young fruit; hidden among the      large leaves, they're difficult to spot and can quickly      grow too large to be tender. The flesh of the young fruit      is snow white with contrasting green ridges, giving a      cross-sectioned slice the appearance of a cogwheel.    </p>    <p>      If picked while still young and tender, vine okra has a      sweet, delicate taste and can be used like summer squash.      For boiling, stirfrying, or steaming, select fruit that are      no more than 6" to 7" long. You can then peel them-or      simply slice off the ridges, as the Chinese do.    </p>    <p>      For batter-frying, choose pods that are 10" to 12" long and      2" or so in diameter. Cut the fruit into 1/4"-thick slices,      leaving the peel on to hold the tender morsels together as      they cook. Dip the slices in a milk-egg mixture, then in      flour or cornmeal before frying.    </p>    <p>      Harvest the fruit of the climbing okra regularly, even if      you have to give some of your crop away. Like other      cucurbits, this vining plant should not be allowed to set      seed-that is, produce mature fruit-until fall.      (Once it does, the vine begins to wither.) Come September,      you can allow a few pods to ripen on the vine for next      year's seed supply.    </p>    <p>      If you enjoy craft projects, you might want to let a few      pods dry as gourds. They turn a warm light brown and make      interesting additions to dried arrangements that are      especially appropriate for Thanksgiving. However, if a      frost is forecast before your gourds are thoroughly dried,      cut them off the vine and hang them by their stems in a      warm, dry place indoors.    </p>    <h3>      A VINE WAY TO GET A GARDEN STARTED    </h3>    <p>      Climbing okra requires the same growing conditions as      melons and cucumbers . . . soil that's rich in organic      matter, and plenty of sun. The plants are very sensitive to      cold and won't thrive in wet, chilly soil. You can start      climbing okra seeds outdoors when nighttime temperatures      are staying above 55Â°F. Or plant them indoors (no more      than three weeks before your best guess at what will be the      last frost date) by sowing two seeds for each 3"- to      4"-diameter pot. Remove the weaker seedling from each      container as soon as the little plants have developed their      first set of true leaves.    </p>    <p>      When the seedlings have been set out in the garden, keep      the soil moist at all times. A 6" layer of straw mulch      regulates moisture beautifully, as well as helping to keep      weeds at bay and preventing low-hanging fruit from touching      the soil and rotting. Feed each vine monthly with one cup      of a 5-10-5 garden fertilizer (diluted according to the      directions on the container). The vine also responds      marvelously to fish-emulsion foliar sprays.    </p>    <p>      Last year I grew climbing okra on the wire surrounding my      large, "finished" compost pile. The plants rooted in the      cool, rich soil with vigor and grew steadily until      fall-even though the summer of 1984 was the hottest      in 138 years here on the Highland Rim of Tennessee.    </p>    <h3>      FIGHTING DISEASE AND PESTILENCE    </h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, the same insects and diseases that plague      the rest of the cucumber family may also afflict climbing      okra. I've had no disease on my vines, but I do fight a      running battle with spotted cucumber beetles. Late in last      year's hot, dry summer, spider mites became a problem as      well. But I've been able to control both pests with a spray      of garlic and red pepper diluted in water. (I've not found      too many insects that can stand up to that combination!)    </p>    <p>      In an edible landscape designed to produce as much bounty      as beauty, climbing okra is hard to top as a plant that's      pretty enough to eat, while tasting every bit as good as it      l ooks.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For an in-depth discussion of      edible-landscape design, see page 40.    </p>
