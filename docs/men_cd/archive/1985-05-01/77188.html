                <p>      <em>Here's the twelfth in a series of articles that will      help you tell friend from foe in your garden.</em>    </p>        <h2 id="subtitle">      Part XII: Aphid Control</h2>      <h5 id="byline">by Ron West</h5>      <p>In our last issue, we took a close look at the biology of      the aphid. Now let's turn our attention to the types of      aphids and what can be done to control them.    </p>    <p>      There would appear to be few plants that are not attacked      by one species or another of aphids. The cabbage aphid (      <em>Brevicoryne brassicae</em> ) is gray with a white waxy      coating and is found on most of the cole crops. The pea      aphid ( <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum</em> ) is green and attacks      many legumes.    </p>    <p>      Cotton aphids ( <em>Aphis gossypii</em> ) are found on      cotton as well as on melons, beans, and beets; of variable      color, they may be green, brown, or black. The      floriculturists among us might eventually meet up with the      rose aphid ( <em>Macrosiphum rosae</em> ), a green species      that forms dense colonies on the buds and tender leaves of      rosebushes. The list of destructive species goes on and on:      bean aphid, peach aphid, apple aphid, potato aphid, woolly      apple aphid, etc. Fortunately, the control of these pests      differs little from one species to another.    </p>            <p>      Nature has numerous weapons with which she offsets the      enormous reproductive capacity of aphids. There are, for      example, many predators that feed on these prolific pests.      The benefits of having ladybugs and green lacewings in your      garden have been discussed in previous issues. Another      important predator is the larvae of the hover fly (family      Syrphidae). These can be recognized by their similarity to      other maggots: They're legless, elongate and tapering,      widest at the rear. Adult hover flies often bear a      remarkable resemblance to yellow and black wasps.    </p>    <p>      Internal parasites also take their toll on the aphid      population. The larvae of tiny braconid and chalcid wasps      feed and develop within the bodies of aphids, eventually      killing them. The unfortunate host takes on a ghostly      appearance and becomes brittle. Such "aphid mummies" are      easy to spot among their nonparasitized kin. The larva of      the wasp may pupate within or outside its host, and it      often leaves a small "door" at the point where it emerges      from the aphid's body.    </p>    <p>      In addition to predators and parasites, various diseases      and adverse environmental conditions further slow the      burgeoning masses of aphids. Still, aphid colonies often      build up to damaging levels, and the gardener must take      action or risk damaged plants and reduced yields.    </p>    <p>      One of the best methods of control is to know where and      when aphid infestations start, and simply begin      hand-crushing the pests early in the season -      <em>before</em> they have a chance to multiply to damaging      levels. Close observation based on past experience will be      your best guide to early outbreaks. While crushing aphids,      be on the lookout for predators and parasites among the      pests. If these are present in sufficient quantity, you      might consider crushing only some of the aphids and leaving      the rest as food for the beneficial insects. It may also be      difficult to crush the pests on young tender growth without      damaging the plant itself. Try using a moistened swab or      toothpick to remove them before crushing.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, there are some instances where hand-crushing is      simply not practical. Perhaps you have a large number of      plants with aphids, or in the case of infestations on trees      and tall shrubs, the pests may be out of reach. One      solution is to blast them from their perches with a strong      jet of water. This must be done carefully on tender plants,      as damage can be inflicted on the foliage as well. Because      of their weak legs, many of the aphids so dislodged will      not be able to crawl back to their feeding grounds -      especially if they've been parasitizing older, taller      plants. Repeat such sprayings as necessary to keep the      pests under control.    </p>    <p>      If these methods fail to give adequate results, a solution      of 1 or 2 tablespoons of dishwashing liquid or laundry soap      per gallon of water can be sprayed on the offenders. This      will remove their protective waxy coating and cause many to      die from desiccation. Use a fairly pure soap and rinse the      plants with clear water the next day. Be sure to spray      thoroughly, covering both sides of the leaves.    </p>    <p>      On trees and shrubs, getting rid of the ants that herd and      protect the aphids will help the natural predators and      parasites keep things under control. A sticky, greaselike      product called Tanglefoot can be applied to the trunks of      trees and bushes to prevent ants from climbing.    </p>    <p>      There are still other alternatives available. It is claimed      that interplanting onions or garlic among other crops will      repel aphids. Countless formulas based on garlic or red-hot      peppers have been devised as all-purpose insect sprays. One      such formulation is made by combining a bulb of garlic, a      couple of onions, and several ground cayenne peppers.    </p>        <p>      Mash these ingredients and let them stand covered with      water for 24 hours - then dilute the mixture to make      one gallon. Strain this and spray it on your plants as      necessary, up to several times daily. Few such home      remedies, including the soap spray described above, have      been tested for safety, so I recommend using them with a      bit of caution and only when other methods fail.    </p>    <p>      Yet another alternative consists of dusting or spraying      diatomaceous earth on the pests. This product consists of      the fossilized remains of microscopic organisms whose sharp      protrusions pierce the aphid's body and cause it to      dehydrate. (It's best to use a product specifically      designed for pest control, as those grades commonly sold      for filtering may not work well on insects.)    </p>    <p>      If, after applying these control measures, you still find a      few aphids in the kettle, don't fret. Even the FDA      considers it perfectly acceptable to have up to 40 aphids      in a 100-gram serving of brussels sprouts! (Think of them      as free protein.)    </p>
