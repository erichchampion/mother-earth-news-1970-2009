    <p>
                        <p>      Five thousand years ago, coriander seeds from the      Mediterranean were being carried along the Silk Road in the      saddlebags of caravans, on their way to enrich the cuisine      of ancient Cathay with their orange-and-sage flavor. A      millennium before the birth of Christ, Egyptian mourners      placed jars of the spice beside gilded sarcophagi to      accompany spirits departing for the Land of the Dead. And      while Aztecs gathered leaves of the Coriandrum sativurn to      season stews, Chinese dined on the plant in hope of making      themselves immortal . . . or put its juice to more      immediate use as a gargle to ease toothaches. Furthermore,      for generations coriander has been eaten as one of the      bitter herbs of the Feast of Passover, and Bombay nights      have been made hotter with coriander-spiced curries.    </p>                    <p>      In summer, Chinese and Mexican produce stores carry fresh      coriander leaves, disguised under the names Chinese parsley      or cilantro, and your local supermarket keeps boxes of the      seeds on its shelves at all seasons. The seeds can spice up      sausages or give confections and puddings a sunny lift. In      fact, the candy coatings of cake sprinkles often conceal      the light brown spheres. A teaspoon of the spice will light      up the flavor of an apple pie. And by adding 1/3 cup of the      chopped leaves and half a teaspoon of cumin to a soup of      meatballs, carrots, onions, and zucchini, you can      approximate a dish popular south of the border-sopo de      albondigas.    </p>    <p>      Since coriander has naturalized widely throughout the U.S.,      you can bet that you won't have to fuss over its      cultivation. As long as it's drenched in sunlight, the      plant thrives in average, well-drained soil, and      overenrichment will only diminish its savor.    </p>    <p>      In late April or early May, plant coriander seeds      (available at most garden stores) in 1/4"-to 1/2"-deep      drills, eight or ten inches apart. Don't expect to see a      sprout for at least a week, and the seeds may laze in the      soil as long as 20 days before germinating. And      before-warned: You're not likely to enjoy the smell of the      intensely green, feathered foliage . . . the plant's name      was justifiably derived from the Greek word for bedbug.      However, the reek fades to a pleasant scent when coriander      matures. By late June or early July, parasols of pinkish      white to lavender florets will start unfurling at the top      of two- or even three-foot-high plants, and because      coriander pollen is pink, your garden will soon be humming      with rosy-knickered bees. In the fall, the shiny, striped      fruits will turn into fawn-colored, hollow, ribbed balls      about 1/8" in diameter. Then-quickly, before they shatter      and reseed the plot-gather in your sweetsmelling harvest.      When the seeds have been dried in a sunny, airy place, you      can remove the adhering husks by rubbing them between your      hands.    </p>    <p>      Feel free to experiment with your harvest. The orangey tang      of coriander transforms beets, pickles, blancmanges, cakes,      cookies, and liqueurs. And if you find yourself driven to      insomnia thinking of even more uses for this herb, just      pour a couple of pints of boiling water over half an ounce      of the crushed seeds. The ancients thought that a      wineglassful of this tea was a ticket straight to the arms      of Morpheus . . . and maybe they were right.    </p>
