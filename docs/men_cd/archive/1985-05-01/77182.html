                        <h5 id="byline">      by Dr. Tom Ferguson    </h5>    <p>      <em>This issue's column was guest-written for Dr. Tom      Ferguson by a contributor to</em> Medical Self-Care      <em>magazine.</em>    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">HEAL YOUR ACHING BACK</h2>    <p><strong>      Esther Wanning with Michael Castleman</strong>    </p>    <p>      On any given day, more than a million North Americans are      confined to bed because of lower back pain. New cases of      back pain occur at the rate of 1.5 million a month, and      more than 200,000 North Americans have back surgery every      year.    </p>    <h3>      The Perils of Being a Vertebrate    </h3>    <p>      As you probably know, the word <em>backbone</em> is a      misnomer; the correct term is <em>spinal column</em> : a      structure composed of 33 vertebrae, most of which are      separated by flexible cartilage disks. From top to bottom,      there are seven <em>cervical</em> vertebrae in the neck, 12      <em>thoracic</em> vertebrae in the chest, and five      <em>lumbar</em> vertebrae in the lower back; then five      vertebrae fused together to form the <em>sacrum</em> , and      four fused to form the <em>coccyx</em> or tailbone. The      vertebral column supports the body and houses the      <em>spinal cord</em> , encased in the <em>spinal canal</em>      , a tunnel formed by holes in the vertebrae.    </p>    <p>      When our ancestors made that bold evolutionary gesture of      standing up, they imposed tremendous stress on the      vertebrae. Their backs became more susceptible to sliding      out of alignment. The most vulnerable area is in the small      of the back where the five lumbar vertebrae are located.    </p>    <p>      In front of the spinal canal is the vertebral body; behind      it, each vertebra has four protruding bony processes that      form joints with the adjoining vertebrae. The vertebrae are      also connected by a network of muscles and ligaments, any      of, which may be strained and cause pain.    </p>    <p>      Between each vertebra and the next is an <em>intervertebral      disk</em> , notorious for "slipping," which is something it      does not actually do. The disk is a thin cartilage pad. Its      center, the <em>nucleus pulposus</em> , is made of      gelatinous material, 80% water, which cushions the      vertebrae and makes the back elastic and flexible.      Surrounding the nucleus pulposus is a harder fibrous ring,      the <em>annulus fibrosus</em> . This is where serious back      trouble usually starts. Accident, injury, or years of poor      posture can weaken the annulus, and a rupture (hernia) can      occur. A portion of the nucleus can protrude through the      annulus. If the protruding portion of the nucleus presses      against a nerve or ligament, the result is back pain. If      the sciatic nerve, which runs down the leg, is affected,      there may also be leg pain. Once a disk herniates, it's      never quite the same. "The herniation," says San Francisco      orthopedic surgeon Stanford Lazar, "can move back away from      the nerve and the pain will resolve. But the disk does not      return to normal. It's unstable, and can pop out again."    </p>    <h3>      Step One: Rule Out Other Diseases    </h3>    <p>      Today, most physicians encourage people with back problems      to manage their conditions with exercise and self-care, but      in the not-too-distant past they gravitated more toward      drugs and surgery. Some still do. Unfortunately, neither      drugs nor surgery is a particularly attractive option. At      best, the former can provide temporary relief (usually with      side effects). And the latter has only about a 50% success      rate.    </p>    <p>      Still, there are plenty of reasons to take a back problem      to a physician <em>before</em> seeking other therapies: The      pain might be a symptom of some other illness -      kidney disease, a tumor, bowel or bladder problems,      gynecological problems in women, or prostate trouble in      men. There might also be a congenital problem, such as      lateral curvature of the spine (scoliosis), or abnormal      front-to-back curvature of the spine (lordosis). After      these possibilities have been ruled out, the way to heal a      bad back is not to "fix it," but rather to <em>stop      hurting</em> it.    </p>    <h3>      Common Causes of Back Pain    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Poor muscle tone</strong> . The spinal column is      like a bridge connecting the upper and lower halves of our      bodies. If the abdominal or lower back muscles or both are      weak, the spine may shift from correct curvature to a shape      that causes pain. Strengthening these muscles is the      foundation of back self-care.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Poor posture</strong> . Good posture not only      improves one's looks, but is essential to a pain-free back.      Slouched standing and sitting can lead to problems. So can      an overly arched spine.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Improper lifting</strong> . This is a frequent      cause of traumatic back injury. <em>Never lift anything by      bending from the waist</em> . Squat down, and with back      straight, lift with the thigh muscles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sedentary lifestyle or poor home and office      furniture</strong> . San Francisco orthopedic surgeon James      Zucherman, a lumbar spine specialist, says that most back      problems are caused by a disk herniating posterially, often      caused by years and years of sitting without proper back      support.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Overdoing exercise</strong> . Most fitness experts      recommend stretching beforehand, though some say to start      slowly and to stretch or do yoga afterwards. If your back      starts hurting while you're exercising, stop whatever      you're doing and rest, apply heat or massage, and do not      resume any strenuous activity until the pain has subsided.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Improper clothing</strong> . Avoid restrictive      clothing, especially high heels, which place tremendous      strain on the back.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Weather</strong> . Damp cold can aggravate back      problems. Try to keep warm and dry.    </p>    <h3>      The Key: Exercise    </h3>    <p>      "The most important element in dealing with back problems,      and preventing them in the first place," Dr. Zucherman      says, "is exercise designed to improve posture and to      increase the strength and flexibility of the back and      abdominal muscles. In fact, with good posture, proper      exercises, and some common sense about sitting and lifting,      most back problems could be prevented."    </p>    <p>      "Even with a disability like a bad back," says Meg Stern, a      leader of back-care classes at Fitness for Living, in San      Rafael, California, "the body has tremendous ability to      change. Coming out of back pain is easy. Staying out is      harder. It means working with breathing, learning body      mechanics, and knowing how to move correctly when      performing everyday tasks."    </p>    <h3>      Dos and Don'ts    </h3>    <p>      Good posture means maintaining correct spinal alignment; it      does not mean standing at military attention, however. When      standing, walking, or running, try to tuck in your      buttocks.    </p>    <p>      Studies show that people working at desk jobs suffer      herniated disks 60% more frequently than people who do not      work at desks. If you work sitting down, the right chair is      a must. Your knees should be as high as your hips. You want      to sit on the two bones of the backside, rather than      distributing your weight over soft tissue, which can cause      numbing. Get out of your chair often.    </p>    <p>      Be careful when sitting and rising. Don't heave yourself      into or out of your chair. To stand, inch forward,      straighten your back gradually, and use your hands to help      you rise.    </p>    <p>      Driving greatly increases risk of back problems. Truckers      are at high risk for disk herniation, and those who      alternate driving with loading and unloading are at even      higher risk. While driving, a lumbar roll - a      cylindrical pillow about four inches in diameter for the      lower back - can be very useful.    </p>    <p>      Sleep in a firm bed.    </p>    <p>      Experiment with sleep positions. Many back experts      recommend sleeping on your side in a fetal position. Some      say sleeping on your back is bad because it doesn't support      the lumbar spine. Others say sleeping on your front is bad      because it exaggerates the arch in the back. Try all      positions and see what works.    </p>    <p>      Avoid bending forward. Lifting your own upper body can hurt      the back.    </p>    <p>      When lifting, in addition to using your thigh muscles, hold      the object as close to your body as possible.    </p>    <p>      Breathe deeply. The diaphragm muscle helps support the      spine.    </p>    <p>      Try to stay slim. Extra weight strains the back.    </p>    <p>      If any physician recommends surgery, get <em>several</em>      other opinions. Back surgery is an iffy proposition.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Medical Self-Care <em>, Dr. Tom      Ferguson's quarterly journal, is available for $15 per year      from Medical Self-Care, P.O.
