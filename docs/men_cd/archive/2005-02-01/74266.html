                    <p><strong>      Gentle, soothing herbs deliver restful slumber.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Steven Foster    </h5>        <p>      Sleep is essential to optimal health, helping our bodies      and minds to recharge, re-energize and successfully      navigate the day’s activities. The amount of sleep      needed for a person to best function varies among      individuals, with eight hours being the average. It is said      that Thomas Edison thrived on only four hours of sleep each      night, but that Albert Einstein required 12 hours for a      good night’s rest.    </p>    <p>      But if there’s one thing we probably all have in      common, it’s that we could use more sleep. With the      stress of modern, busy lifestyles, it’s not uncommon      to have a hard time falling asleep or getting enough rest.      Sleep difficulty ranks third as a common complaint for      individuals seeking medical advice, right behind headaches      and the common cold. Each year, a third of Americans      reportedly suffer at least occasional difficulty in falling      asleep, and between 10 percent and 20 percent of the U.S.      population has habitual or severe difficulty in falling      asleep.    </p>    <p>      More women are affected by sleep disturbances than men,      and, statistically, sleep disturbances are known to      increase with age. With little or no treatment, sleep      disturbances can evolve into an increased risk of physical      and mental disorders such as depression.    </p>    <p>      When most of us think of problems associated with sleeping,      the word “insomnia” often comes to mind.      Insomnia refers specifically to difficulty falling asleep,      staying asleep or both. It can manifest in different      patterns, including awakening frequently during the night,      waking up too early in the morning or just poor sleep      quality. To describe insomnia, herbal practitioners prefer      the phrases “sleep disturbances” or      “sleeping difficulties.”    </p>    <p>      Call it what you will - anxiety, stress or just plain      excitement - the ups and downs of daily life can lead      to sleep troubles. As a result, many people turn to      prescription medications, which are potent drugs that may      involve health risks including habit-forming behavior and      even overdose. These drugs may often react with alcohol, as      is the case with barbiturates, or lead to clumsiness or      drowsiness the next day. Over-the-counter drugs are      available, too, but they also may cause side effects such      as grogginess, dry mouth and constipation.    </p>    <p>      For many consumers who do not need a physician’s      attention, herbs may successfully help them achieve better      sleep without unwanted side effects.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Three Types of Insomnia</em>    </h3>    <p>      Transient insomnia often results from lifestyle or      situation changes in our environment, or extra stress in      our lives. Travel is a good example. Many people have a      difficult time sleeping on an airplane, especially during a      long flight, with the anticipation of arriving at a new      location or because of nervousness from flying. This      excitement keeps the brain overactive and makes it      difficult to relax. Transient insomnia usually lasts for      one week or less.    </p>    <p>      Short-term insomnia typically lasts one to three weeks and      can be triggered by severe stress, such as a divorce or the      loss of a job. It can develop into long-term or chronic      insomnia if not treated.    </p>    <p>      Long-term/chronic insomnia can last as little as three      weeks, but the problem can stretch into years for some      individuals. Chronic insomnia can result from physical      problems such as pain from arthritis, angina pectoris or      headaches; respiratory problems including asthma and      bronchitis; or specific sleep disorders including sleep      apnea, where breathing stops during sleep. Substance abuse,      including abuse of alcohol, nicotine or caffeine, also can      lead to chronic sleep problems.    </p>    <p>      Herbal remedies can provide a low-risk and proven      alternative to over-the-counter sleep aids, barring any      physical or psychological problems requiring more involved      professional treatment.    </p>    <p>      Herbs used for the treatment of insomnia generally produce      a depressant effect on the central nervous system.      According to Varro Tyler, Ph.D., in his book Herbs of      Choice, agents used to treat anxiety or insomnia are      referred to by numerous names, including “sleep aids,      sedatives, hypnotics, soporifics, antianxiety agents,      anxiolytics, calmatives and minor tranquilizers.”      Herbs that fall into any of the above categories are often      ambiguously called “nervines.” The best-known      and best-researched herbal sleep aid is valerian (Valeriana      officinalis). Other herbal sleep aids include hops (Humulus      lupulus), passionflower (Passiflora incarnata), chamomile      (Matricaria recutita) and lemon balm (Melissa officinalis).      All are easy to grow in home gardens in most regions of the      United States.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Valerian: Well Researched</em>    </h3>    <p>      Valerian is the best-documented herbal sleep aid. Over the      past 20 years, more than 200 studies of valerian have been      published in scientific literature, especially in Europe,      including more than 10 controlled clinical studies.      Experimental data indicate a rational scientific basis for      valerian’s mild sedative qualities.    </p>    <p>      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover      study published in a 2000 issue of the journal      Pharmacopsychiatry evaluated the effects of a valerian      extract in 16 patients, when given a single dose of      valerian and after a multiple-dose treatment for four      weeks. The German researchers studied both objective and      subjective parameters. They assessed subjective parameters      including sleep quality, morning feeling, daytime      performance, perceived duration of sleep latency (time it      took to fall asleep) and sleep period (total length of time      asleep). Objective parameters included sleep-stage analysis      and arousal index.    </p>    <p>      After a single dose of valerian, no effects on the      patients’ sleep quality were observed. After      multiple-dose treatment for four weeks, however, sleep      efficiency for those who took valerian showed an increase      in comparison to baseline measures. Researchers confirmed      significant differences between valerian and the placebo      for parameters describing slow-wave sleep (non-REM, or      nondreaming, sleep, which occurs earlier than REM sleep and      makes up much of the sleep cycle). In comparison with the      placebo, participants fell asleep much more quickly after      long-term administration of valerian.    </p>    <p>      Valerian also had a very low number of adverse reactions.      The authors concluded the valerian treatment demonstrated      positive effects for insomnia patients, and therefore could      be recommended for patients with mild psychophysiological      insomnia.    </p>    <p>      One of the most appealing aspects of using valerian as a      sleep aid is that it does not interact with alcohol and      does not leave the user with a “hangover” in      the morning.    </p>    <p>      Another study by German researchers, published in a 1999      issue of Pharmacopsychiatry, evaluated the effects of a      valerian root extract on reaction time, alertness and      concentration. The randomized, controlled, double-blind      trial involving 102 volunteers found that single and      repeated evening doses of 600 milligrams of valerian      extract did not have a negative impact on reaction time,      alertness or concentration the morning after taking the      extract. It is reported, however, that some individuals may      experience a stimulant effect or develop a headache from      the use of the herb. If used as a sleep aid, a dose      equivalent to 2 to 3 grams of the herb should be taken      after dinner and another equal dose one hour before      bedtime. (For home preparations, you may want to consider      buying a gram scale. They are widely available and prices      start at about $20.)    </p>    <h3>      <em>Hops: Not Just for Beer</em>    </h3>        <p>      Hops are the fruiting bodies of Humulus lupulus, a vine      grown commercially in the Pacific Northwest for flavoring      beer. Hops have traditionally been used to stimulate      digestion, but use of hops as a sedative is possible, too.      A condition called hops-picker fatigue has been identified,      in which hops pickers were observed to tire easily,      presumably because of contact with the plant’s resin      or perhaps from inhaling its essential oil. Sedative action      has been attributed to a volatile compound in hops, which      provides a rational basis for the traditional use of      hops-filled pillows to help aid sleep.    </p>    <p>      In Germany, the herb is approved for discomfort from      restlessness, anxiety and sleep disturbances. The suggested      dose is 0.5 grams of the fruits (known as strobiles). Or,      an effective hops delivery form might just be drinking a      good beer - that is, if you can avoid getting up in      the night to go to the bathroom. In this case, however, one      must beg the question: Is it the hops in the beer or is it      the alcohol that helps one calm down and get a good      night’s sleep? More research needs to be conducted on      hops to confirm its utility as a sleep aid.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Passionflower: for Anxiety</em>    </h3>    <p>      Passionflower is a vine common in the southeastern United      States. German regulatory authorities cite passionflower as      a potential help for “conditions of nervous      anxiety.” The degree of effect is dependent upon the      dose. The experience of numerous medical practitioners in      Europe helps confirm the plant’s safety and efficacy.    </p>    <p>      A clinical study reported in a 2001 issue of the Journal of      Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics adds to the scientific      evidence for passionflower’s use in general anxiety      disorders. Iranian researchers compared a passionflower      extract, the drug oxazepam (a tranquilizer sold under the      trade name Serax) and a placebo in a double-blind      randomized trial. The study was performed on 36 outpatients      diagnosed with general anxiety disorder. Eighteen patients      were randomly selected to receive 45 drops of a      passionflower extract (or a placebo) per day, and the other      18 received either 30 milligrams of oxazepam or a placebo.      Patients in both groups over the four-week trial period had      similar positive results in the reduction of anxiety, with      no significant differences in effects between the      comparative treatment groups. However, patients in the      passionflower group had significantly fewer problems in job      performance compared to the oxazepam group. This led the      researchers to conclude that the passionflower extract was      effective for management of general anxiety disorder,      warranting a larger controlled clinical study.    </p>    <p>      Another recent study looked at differences in anti-anxiety      effects of passionflower leaves, stems, flowers, whole      plants and roots. Researchers found the flowers and roots      had much less activity than the stems and leaves,      suggesting the roots and flowers should be removed prior to      manufacturing a product. The German health authorities list      the proper dosage of the herb at 6 grams per day in an      infusion (tea). Passionflower makes a good additive      ingredient when combined with chamomile tea before bedtime.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Chamomile: a Perennial Favorite</em>    </h3>        <p>      If I’ve had a big evening out on the town, with a      trip to a favorite restaurant followed by a stop at a local      coffee shop for an espresso and dessert, I not only have an      overstimulated central nervous system but an overstimulated      digestive system as well. Back at home, I’m looking      for two results: Calm my mind and calm my stomach. To solve      both needs, I turn to a warm cup of chamomile tea before      bed.    </p>    <p>      The most widely used chamomile is the annual herb known as      German or Hungarian chamomile (Matricaria recutita). The      German name of chamomile translates into “capable of      anything,” and indeed in Western Europe chamomile is      as highly regarded as ginseng is in China. An infusion of 2      to 3 grams (a heaping tablespoonful) of dried chamomile      flowers steeped in a cup of water makes a good tea of this      soothing medicinal herb.    </p>    <p>      Traditionally, chamomile is used to treat mild sleep      disorders, especially in children. Although its use as a      sleep aid is not well supported by human studies,      pharmacological studies do show it has a mild sedative      effect. A 1982 study by Italian researchers showed that      chamomile extracts had mild central nervous system      depressant activity.    </p>    <p>      A 1995 study by researchers in Argentina looked at the      effects of chamomile flowers on mice. They found a low dose      (3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) had virtually no      sedative effects, but a high dose (30 milligrams per      kilogram) had a slight sedative effect.    </p>    <p>      The scientific jury is still out on whether      chamomile’s traditional claims as a sleep aid are      valid, but a cup of warm chamomile tea before bed could be      like the proverbial warm glass of milk at bedtime -      soothing and relaxing, no matter what its medicinal      activity might be. I like it, and it works for me.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Lemon Balm: Pleasant & Calming</em>    </h3>    <p>      Lemon balm is another favorite herb for a soothing bedtime      tea. Traditionally, the herb was used to treat anxiety and      to relieve insomnia. Recent studies and traditional use      have suggested that lemon balm and its essential oil may      play a role in improving cognitive disorders.    </p>    <p>      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study      published in a 2002 issue of Pharmacology, Biochemistry and      Behavior looked at the herb’s cognitive effects in 20      healthy volunteers. The study found that a single dose of      300, 600 or 900 milligrams of a lemon balm extract at      seven-day intervals produced a feeling of calmness. Even      the lowest dose created a feeling of calmness, helping to      support traditional claims.    </p>    <p>      Lemon balm should be taken after an evening meal and once      again just before bedtime. Add about 2 teaspoons of the      ground leaves to a cup of steaming hot water. Then sweeten      the tea with a little honey, if desired. Lemon balm’s      pleasant, warm, lemonlike flavor makes it a delicious      drink.    </p>    <p>      Considered an authority on herbal medicine, Steven Foster      specializes in medicinal and aromatic plants.

To make a hops      pillow, mix together the following ingredients:    </p>    <p>      <em>¼ cup dried hops</em> <em><br />      1/8 cup dried chamomile flowers<br />      1/8 cup dried lavender flower<br />      3 drops lavender essential oil</em>    </p>    <p>      Set the mixture aside. Cut 2 pieces of fabric, each about 8      inches square, and sew around the edges to make a pillow,      leaving enough room to insert a tablespoon. Spoon the herb      mixture into the pillow and sew it shut. Place the hops      pillow under your regular pillow for a good night’s      sleep.    </p>
