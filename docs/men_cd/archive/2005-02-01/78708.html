                    <p><strong>      <em>Tap the benefits of delicious fermented milk      products.</em></strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Lynn Keiley    </h5>        <p>      Cultured dairy products - yogurt, soft cheeses,      buttermilk and kefir - taste great, and are easy and      fun to make at home by simply adding cultures of selected      strains of yeast or bacteria to start the process of      fermentation. The cultures add rich and tangy flavors to      the dairy products. These cultured foods boost your immune      system, provide calcium and aid your digestion. For those      with lactose intolerance, these foods are also a welcome      alternative. According to Steve Hertzler, assistant      professor of human nutrition at Ohio State University,      “The active cultures in these products convert      lactose, a carbohydrate found in milk, into a more easily      digestible form.”    </p>    <p>      People have been making yogurt and other cultured dairy      products for thousands of years. Traces of fermented foods      have been found in Mesopotamia, which is considered the      birthplace of civilization, but experts suspect these foods      originated with nomadic tribes of western Asia and Eastern      Europe because fermentation made their dairy products      easier to transport and less prone to spoilage.    </p>    <p>      Cultured foods are surprisingly quick and simple to make at      home, and your homemade products can taste better than many      oversugared grocery store brands. You can add your own      favorite toppings such as fruits, nuts and sweeteners, too.    </p>    <h3>      Getting Started    </h3>        <p>      If you’ve ever worked with yeast or sourdough starter      cultures for making bread, you’re already familiar      with making cultured dairy products.epending upon what      you’re making, you can use store-bought yogurt or      buttermilk to develop your starter culture. Or to be      certain of a good, strong culture, you can purchase a      commercial starter. This is often a one-time purchase      because with a little care, you can keep your family of      friendly microbes hard at work for years to come.    </p>    <p>      They are not overly fussy about the fat content in milk, so      you can make yogurt from whole or skim milk. Use organic      milk whenever possible, and if you have access to milk from      grass-fed cows, the flavor and nutrition of your yogurt      will be much improved.    </p>    <p>      It’s true that humans derive many benefits from      eating “living” dairy products, but the      microbes that actually do the work have selfish motives.      These bacteria feed on the carbohydrates in milk -      namely lactose - for energy. This process creates      other more acidic byproducts that impart the tangy flavor      found in yogurt, buttermilk and kefir. Not all bacteria are      “friendly,” so the trick is controlling the      process to cultivate the types you want.    </p>    <h3>      Tools    </h3>    <p>      There’s no need to buy fancy machines to make yogurt      or other cultured dairy products - chances are you      already have everything you need right in your kitchen. The      most important factor to keep in mind is that everything      needs to be perfectly clean so you don’t invite any      unwanted bacteria into your mix. Here’s a list of      items you should gather before getting started:    </p>    <p>      <em>Heavy-bottomed stainless steel pot<br />      Cheesecloth<br />      Plastic strainer<br />      Stainless steel or plastic spoon<br />      2 to 3 quart jars (sterilized)<br />      Measuring cup<br />      Instant-read thermometer<br />      Picnic cooler (optional)<br />      Yogurt</em>    </p>    <p>      If you have access to good-quality commercial yogurt with      live cultures, use about 3 tablespoons as your starter      culture. Otherwise, purchase a commercial starter. Natural      food stores usually carry both items. Temperature      recommendations on packaged cultures may vary, so be sure      to read the instructions before you begin.    </p>    <p>      Heat 1 quart milk to about 185 degrees, or as directed by      the commercial product’s instructions. Then, allow it      to cool to between 105 and 115 degrees. Stir in the culture      and mix well. Pour the mixture into a quart jar and put on      the lid. While the culture is forming, the temperature of      the milk should remain at about 110 degrees. If you      don’t have a commercial yogurt maker to regulate the      temperature, try one of these ideas:    </p>    <p>      • Put the quart jar into a medium-sized picnic cooler      with a couple jars of hot water, then close the cooler.    </p>    <p>      • Put the quart jar of yogurt mixture into a gas oven      with a pilot light.    </p>    <p>      • Put the mixture into a thermos bottle.    </p>    <p>      • Wrap the jar of yogurt in a blanket.    </p>    <p>      Check the yogurt in four to six hours. When the curd is      well formed, place the yogurt in the refrigerator. A little      whey may form around the edges - simply pour it off      or stir it in when you’re ready to dig in. Enjoy the      yogurt plain or flavor it with honey, maple syrup or fresh      fruit.    </p>    <h3>      Kefir    </h3>    <p>      Tangier than yogurt but sweeter than buttermilk, kefir      (pronounced ka-FEER) is thought to have originated in the      Caucasian Mountains in Russia, where it’s still a      daily food staple. You can buy packaged kefir culture, but      true aficionados use kefir grains - little white      kernels about the size of tapioca that swell and initiate      fermentation. A good kefir involves many different types of      friendly bacteria as well as some yeasts, and it packs one      of the strongest health punches of all the cultured dairy      foods.    </p>    <p>      Like most good cultures, kefir grains become more reactive      the more they’re used. To get your culture started,      place 4 tablespoons of grains into a jar and add a cup of      milk. Stir gently, then allow the mixture to sit for 12 to      24 hours at room temperature. When the culture is ready,      the mixture will have thickened and some whey may have      separated. Strain the kefir through a sieve, gently      stirring the grains (never pressing!) as the liquid drains      into another container.    </p>    <p>      Place the grains into a clean container, add another cup of      milk and repeat the process. To make larger batches, allow      the culture to complete its process, then add twice as much      milk and allow it to ferment until thickened.ouble the      quantity of milk until you reach the desired amount.    </p>    <p>      As you continue to make kefir, the number of your grains      will grow. You can share some of them with friends, or dry      and store them in a plastic storage bag for eight to 10      months. (Allow a few extra days to get them started when      you’re ready to reactivate the grains.)    </p>    <p>      Marilyn Jarzembski, a kefir enthusiast who sells grains by      mail suggests moving the process to your refrigerator. The      cooler temperatures will slow down the kefir process, and      the grains will survive as long as two weeks without any      attention.    </p>    <p>      Natural carbonation makes kefir fizzy and perfect for      smoothies, popular among kefir fans. Simply pour the liquid      into a blender and mix with fresh fruit such as      strawberries, blueberries or mangos.    </p>    <h3>      Chevre (soft cheese)    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Cultured Dairy Sources</strong>    </p>  <p>    <em>Ready-made Brands<br />      Stonyfield Farm<br />Organic yogurts<br />      <a href="http://www.stonyfield.com" target="_blank">www.stonyfield.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Nancy’s<br />      Kefir, organic yogurts<br />      <a href="http://www.nancysyogurt.com" target="_blank">www.nancysyogurt.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Horizon<br />      Organic yogurts<br />      <a href="http://www.horizonorganic.com" target="_blank">www.horizonorganic.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Brown Cow<br />      All-natural yogurts<br />      <a href="http://www.browncowfarm.com" target="_blank">www.browncowfarm.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Seven Stars Farm<br />      Organic yogurts<br />      (610) 935-1949</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Make-at-home Sources</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>New England Cheesemaking Supply<br />      (413) 628-3808<br />      <a href="http://www.cheesemaking.com" target="_blank">www.cheesemaking.com</a><br />      Starter cultures, cheese molds and books.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Marilyn Jarzembski (419) 237-3095<br />      marilynjarz@yahoo.com</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Authentic kefir grains. $20 per order.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>A one-time purchase can last a lifetime.</em>    </p>    <p>      Chevre is a fresh, usually soft, goat cheese. The word      “chevre” comes from France, where various      chevres are popular.    </p>    <p>      Here in the United States, we’re most familiar with      the smooth, creamy version. Following is a simple cheese      for beginners, and a mild-flavored introduction for those      who may not be familiar with the distinctive tanginess of      goat cheeses. Here’s the recipe:    </p>    <p>      Heat 1 gallon of goat’s milk (cow’s milk can be      substituted, but the cheese’s flavor will be more      akin to cream cheese) in a large pot until it reaches 160      degrees and hold it there for 30 minutes. Then, cool the      milk to about 72 degrees.    </p>    <p>      Pour the mixture into a bowl and add one package of      commercial chevre culture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap      and allow it to sit at room temperature until the curds and      whey separate (18 to 24 hours).    </p>    <p>      Pour the curds into a strainer lined with cheesecloth, then      tie them into a bundle and allow them to drain overnight at      room temperature. In the morning, salt the curds to taste.    </p>    <p>      Eat the curds plain or press them into decorative molds      (see “Cultured Dairy Sources,” at right). Roll      the formed cheese in fresh herbs such as chives, dill or      thyme, and store your chevre in a jar covered with olive      oil and herbs.    </p>    <h3>      What are Cultured Dairy “Probiotics”?    </h3>    <p>      Probiotic means “for life,” and      “probiotics” in cultured dairy products -      yogurt, buttermilk and many soft cheeses - are      nothing more than types of beneficial bacteria typically      found in such foods. Traditionally, these fermented foods      tend to have a smooth and tangy, yet light flavor. They      help boost your immune system and are easier on the stomach      than other dairy foods because the bacteria added to milk      break down the natural lactose in the milk.    </p>    <p>      There are two specific strains of bacteria that are most      commonly referred to as probiotics: Bifidobacterium and      Lactobacillus acidophilus. These “friendly”      bacteria exist naturally among the hundred or so types      already present in our gastrointestinal system, but they      are under constant siege by human indulgences such as when      we drink coffee or alcohol, eat lots of onions and garlic,      or take antibiotics. Making and eating your own cultured      dairy products can ensure your body’s well-stocked      with these health-enhancing “probiotic”      bacteria.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kefir Grain Exchange</strong>    </p>    <p>      <a href="http://http://66.46.11.99/clarkson/Show/Clark son/kefir/default.asp" target="_blank">http://66.46.11.99/clarkson/Show/Clark    son/kefir/default.asp    </a></p>    <p>      Share grains with kefir enthusiasts all over the world.    </p>
