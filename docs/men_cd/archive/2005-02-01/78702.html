                    <h5 id="byline">      By Lynn Keiley    </h5>    <p>      <em>Some fats are killing us, some actually make us      healthier. Which ones are you eating?</em>    </p>        <p>      “Butter (high in saturated fat) is bad for you; use      margarine instead.” That’s the message most of      us have been hearing for the last several decades. But now      scientists have discovered that the hydrogenation process      used to make margarine and shortening produces trans fats      that are actually twice as bad for our hearts as saturated      fats. Butter, it turns out, is a healthier choice than many      brands of margarine and shortening. Small wonder that      we’ve been so confused all this time.    </p>    <p>      It’s still true that fats and oils are high in      calories. And it’s still true that most of us eat too      much fat and more total calories than we need, causing us      to gain weight. But fats and oils are an essential part of      a healthy diet, and some are more healthful and taste      better than others. To help you make the best choices,      here’s a rundown of the health and flavor aspects of      fats and oils:    </p>    <h3>      <em>The Basics</em>    </h3>        <p>      Fats, carbohydrates and proteins are the major components      of all foods. Fats give us energy; help regulate our blood      pressure, heart rate, blood flow and nervous systems; and      carry fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) throughout our      bodies. Fats also make us feel satisfied, thus helping us      eat fewer calories. A recent study from Oxford, England,      shows that eating fat ignites certain pleasure sensors in      the brain - the same areas that light up at the      sensation of a caress, the scent of a seductive perfume or      upon winning money.    </p>    <p>      Fats are dense in calories - twice as much as      carbohydrates and proteins - which is why we need to      watch how much of them we eat.    </p>    <p>      They come in four basic types: monounsaturated,      polyunsaturated, saturated and trans fats, all of which you      can quickly learn to tell apart. The good fats are      monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats; in addition to      olive and canola oils, other mono oils easy to find in the      grocery store are peanut and avocado. Polyunsaturated fats      that are widely available in grocery stores include      safflower, corn, sunflower, soy and cottonseed oils.    </p>    <p>      Saturated fat, primarily found in meat, chocolate and      full-fat dairy products, has both good and bad effects on      our health. Trans fats are formed when oils are partially      hydrogenated so they resemble saturated fats in texture and      consistency. Many brands of margarine and shortening      contain significant amounts of trans fats. Scientific      research now shows that many trans fats contribute more to      heart disease than the saturated fats.    </p>    <p>      Different types of fats directly impact the cholesterol      levels in our bodies. So, the trick to a heart-healthy diet      is knowing the ways cholesterol is affected by different      types of fat. Cholesterol moves back and forth from our      livers to our tissues in two basic forms: LDL (low density      lipoprotein particles or “bad” cholesterol) and      HDL (high-density lipoproteins or “good”      cholesterol). The LDL shuttles fat and cholesterol from the      liver to cells that need it, but fat can build up inside      the walls of our arteries in the process (doctors call this      “plaque build-up”). The HDL returns cholesterol      to the liver and doesn’t build up plaque at all.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Good Fats</em>    </h3>    <p>      Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are found      primarily in plant, nut and seed sources, and both lower      bad LDL cholesterol while raising good HDL. Monounsaturated      fats are typically liquid at room temperature, although      they solidify somewhat if refrigerated.    </p>    <p>      An important type of polyunsaturated fat is omega-3 fatty      acid, a superstar of the nutrition world. It reduces the      risk of irregular heartbeats, lowers blood pressure and may      protect against certain types of cancer. The best omega-3      sources are flaxseeds, green leafy vegetables and walnuts      and their oils, as well as fatty fish such as salmon,      mackerel, trout and herring.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Saturated fats</em>    </h3>    <p>      Recent research shows that saturated fats are not quite the      villain they’ve been portrayed to be all these years.      It’s true that a diet high in saturated fat will      raise LDL cholesterol, but that negative effect is      counterbalanced by saturated fat’s ability to also      raise the good HDL cholesterol. Saturated fats are found in      butter, whole milk, cheese, red meat, chocolate and      coconuts. They are solid at room temperatures.    </p>    <h3>      Trans fats: Good Intentions Gone Bad?    </h3>    <p>      Some trans fats naturally occur in small amounts, but the      majority are made when oils are “hydrogenated”      by heating in the presence of hydrogen and fine particles      of nickel metal. The process changes the properties of the      oil, making it more solid and easier to ship and store. But      in the process, these trans fats, which we now know are      more detrimental to our health than saturated fats, are      formed.    </p>    <p>      In the wake of growing concerns about fat in the 1950s, the      mass marketing of these hydrogenated products took off, and      today, you’ll find them in everything from soda,      crackers and cookies to French fries, peanut butter and      many microwave popcorns (see “Tracking Down Trans      Fats,” above).    </p>    <p>      Processed food manufacturers now are under government      mandate to disclose trans fat content on nutrition labels      by 2006. “Trans fat-free” labels are already      appearing on some foods that previously depended heavily on      them, but removing this unhealthy ingredient entirely from      industrial food products is a major undertaking.    </p>        <p>      The research shows trans fats have the worst possible      effect on cholesterol metabolism - they increase LDL      (the bad) cholesterol, and they decrease HDL (the good)      cholesterol. According to Walter C. Willett, chairman of      the Department of Nutrition at Harvard University,      “This combined effect on the ratio of LDL to HDL is      double that of saturated fatty acids.” Even small      amounts of trans fats in our daily diets can do a large      amount of damage, he says. For every 2-percent increase in      the amount of calories from trans fat, the risk of heart      disease increases by 36 percent.    </p>    <p>      And incredibly, replacing that same 2 percent of calories      from trans fat with unsaturated fats conversely can reduce      the risk of heart disease by as much as 53 percent.    </p>    <h3>      Separating the Good Fats from the Bad    </h3>    <p>      <em><strong>Tracking Down Trans Fats</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Because researchers have discovered that some hydrogenated      oils used to make margarine and shortening are unhealthy,      the Food and Drug Administration is requiring food      manufacturers to begin listing the amount of trans fats on      nutrition labels, but the new regulations don’t go      into effect until 2006. Go to www.transfree america.org for      more information. Here’s how you can avoid them in      the meantime:    </p>    <p>      • Avoid foods that contain ingredients such as      “partially hydrogenated vegetable oil” or      “shortening,” unless they are labeled      “Trans fat-free.”    </p>    <p>      • Pay attention to the order of the ingredients (they      are listed in descending order). If a partially      hydrogenated oil appears near the beginning that means the      trans fat content is high and you may want to make a      different choice. If the words appear toward the end, the      food may be acceptable.    </p>    <p>      • If you want to know what percentage of trans fats a      product contains, do the math. Subtract the specific types      of fat (i.e., saturated fat) from the total fats. The      resulting number is a good estimate of the amount of trans      fat per serving.    </p>    <p>      <em>Source: The Trans Fat Solution: Cooking and Shopping to      Eliminate the Deadliest Fat from Your Diet, by Kim Severson      (Ten Speed Press, 2003).</em>    </p>

Sesame and peanut oils can be used in anything from salads to stir-fry dishes. As for storage, most vegetable oils store for several months in the pantry. Flaxseed, sesame and walnut require refrigeration.
