                    <h5 id="byline">      Edited by Carol Mack    </h5>        <h3>      <em>Maritime Canada & New England</em>    </h3>    <p>      Do I detect the faintest smell of spring in the air or is      it just wishful thinking? January catalog perusals have      turned into seed orders arriving in the mailbox, and      it’s time to get out the seed-starting trays. I wash      them with castile soap or a mild (3-percent to 5-percent)      bleach solution. Start early seedlings of pansies,      petunias, onions, leeks, peppers and eggplant, as well as      celery and celeriac. I plant a few tomatoes now, especially      ‘Sungold’ cherry, and wait to sow my main crop      in early April. It’s time to prune fruit trees      - get outside and enjoy the sun’s warmth and      fresh air. Save some shoots of last year’s growth      (scions) for grafting in April. Triple wrap the scion wood      in plastic and store in a refrigerator or cold cellar until      needed.o not store scion wood in the same place as apples      because they release ethylene gas, which can kill the wood.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Roberta Bailey, FEDCO Seeds, Waterville,      Maine.</em>    </p>    <h3>      <em>Mid-Atlantic</em>    </h3>    <p>      Are your seeds ordered yet? You may face availability      problems if you procrastinate! February is the time to      start peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbages and eggplant      in flats. (Our favorite homestead peppers are ‘Doe      Hill Golden Bell’ and ‘Aji Dulce.’) Begin      planting leafy greens in March, but do so sparingly -      planting a few seeds each week is the key. Red mustard and      lettuces add a colorful twist to the salad mix. Wait until      mid-March to start the main crop of tomatoes. When the      whippoorwill sings, begin transplanting the earliest      brassicas, greens and tomatoes outside under row covers.    </p>    <p>      Do you want to reclaim an area overrun with blackberries,      kudzu or Jerusalem artichokes? Scrounge up some sturdy      fencing and buy a piglet or two. They will turn the old      established roots into meat, while ridding your soil of      weeds and increasing the soil’s nutrient levels. The      plot will be the star of your garden next year.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Cricket Rakita, Southern Exposure Seed      Exchange, Mineral, Va.</em>    </p>    <h3>      <em>Southern Interior</em>    </h3>    <p>      Starting tomatoes from seed? Sow them six to eight weeks      before the last expected frost and keep them between 75 and      85 degrees until they germinate. Keep them in strong      sunlight or fluorescent light. Pepper seeds can be sown at      the same time, but they take longer to develop strong      roots. Wait until four weeks past the last frost date to      set transplants out into the garden. Garden peas like cool      weather, so they should be sown six weeks before the last      spring frost. do not over-fertilize or blossoms may drop.      Get those pea trellises up, too. Even if the variety you      plant isn’t supposed to need staking, it will produce      better if it has support.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Lori Hardee, Karen Park Jennings, Park Seed      Co., Greenwood, S.C.</em>    </p>    <h3>      <em>Gulf Coast</em>    </h3>    <p>      There’s a temptation to “jump the gun”      and plant the tomato patch in February - just      remember there’s always the chance for a late freeze      in March, and these early plantings don’t seem to      last as long. If you give in, add a later planting to      continue the tomato harvest into August.      ‘Dona,’ ‘Carmello’ and      ‘Champion’ are varieties that are hard to beat.      The giantfruited varieties -      ‘Brandywine,’ ‘Beefsteak’ and the      like - are usually poor producers on a      yield-per-plant basis. Sow beans and corn throughout March,      and transplant peppers and eggplant later in the month, but      wait until it really warms up in April for Southern peas      and okra. If you’re working up new beds, don’t      forget the compost. A few inches incorporated into the soil      can work wonders. Top-dress fruit trees with compost, too.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Bill Adams, Burton, Texas.</em>    </p>    <h3>      <em>Central/Midwest</em>    </h3>    <p>      While you are ordering your seeds, starting mix, trays and      tools, why not take some time to think about pest problems?      Combining pest-control products with your seed order will      save shipping costs. More importantly, you will be prepared      when the uninvited guests attack, instead of panicking and      rushing out to buy whatever you can find. Thinking ahead      also can help you take effective action when insects and      disease organisms are at the most vulnerable stages of      their life cycles - or time plantings to avoid damage      altogether.id you notice bird damage last summer or hear      the sound of squirrel laughter and find paw prints where      sunflower seeds used to be? Planning your garden to avoid      straight rows, or mixing vegetables with flowers may      confuse animals enough to spare some plants for you. For      more certain protection, order plastic mesh. I have mine on      hoops like a mini-greenhouse and now enjoy whole heads of      lettuce instead of squirrel-created      “frisée.”    </p>    <p>      <em>- Connie Dam-Byl, William Dam Seeds Ltd., Dundas,      Ontario.</em>    </p>    <h3>      <em>North Central & Rockies</em>    </h3>    <p>      This time of hope and lengthening days just may be the most      wonderful season for cold-country gardeners. We are still      harvesting Brussels sprouts, kale and evergreen bunching      onions from beneath receding snows. The deep, sweet smell      of earthy potting soil fills the kitchen as we prepare      flats to receive pepper, tomato and cabbage-family seeds.      Our tried-and-tested potting mix is equal parts compost,      peat moss and coarse sand. Flats are kept in a 70-degree      location, covered with a layer of wet newspaper to insure      good germination. Once the little green arches of new      plants poke through the soil, provide lots of direct light.      Transplant to a larger container before they become      root-bound, which slows their growth and loses precious      momentum. If your tomatoes become leggy, remove the first      set of leaves and transplant them deeper in the soil. The      leggy stem will become part of a healthy root system.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Bill McDorman, Seeds Trust, High Altitude      Gardens, Hailey, Idaho.</em>    </p>    <h3>      <em>Pacific Northwest</em>    </h3>    <p>      The calendar may say winter, but it’s time to think      spring. Peppers can be started in late February and      tomatoes in March. After seedlings germinate, adequate      light and moderate temperatures will assure sturdy plants.      Starting transplants takes a little time and planning, but      growing your own plants is richly satisfying and gives you      an interesting and economical plant selection. If you need      more rosemary or lavender plants, peg a few branches to the      moist ground and in a few months they’ll root and      form a new plant. Take advantage of breaks in our winter      weather to get after the early weeds and sow seeds for      spring greens and lettuces. One way to keep ahead of weeds      is to get your garden favorites growing early. Keep ahead      of the slugs with one of the new nontoxic iron-based      products such as Sluggo.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Rose Marie Nichols McGee, Nichols Garden      Nursery, Albany, Ore.; Josh Kirschenbaum, Territorial Seed      Co., Cottage Grove, Ore.</em>    </p>    <h3>      <em>Southwest</em>    </h3>    <p>      Excitement builds in February as we watch our      fall-collected seed turn into seedlings in the greenhouse.      We divide yacon roots for seedling production - this      sweet, crunchy tuber is also known as Bolivian sunroot and      has been a staple of the Andean people for centuries.      Onions and leeks are seeded into a potting mix of coir      (coconut husk fibers), compost, sand, alfalfa meal,      cottonseed meal and perlite. Meanwhile, seeds of lobelia,      echinacea, culver’s root and astragalus make their      way to the refrigerator in wet, moist sand for 30 days of      stratification before they are patted into the surface of      our potting mix. This process improves germination for      these beautiful perennials, which are also very effective      in attracting beneficials. Out in the garden, it is time to      plant snap and snow peas for a June harvest of these      delicious pods. We peruse garden catalogs for anything we      forgot - and hope they haven’t sold out!    </p>    <p>      <em>- Erica Renaud, Seeds of Change, Santa Fe,      N.M.</em><br />    </p>
