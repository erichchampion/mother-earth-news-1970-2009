        <p>It's best to avoid getting sunburned, rather than endure the smiting consequences. But if you do spend too much time in the sun, try these five natural remedies to soothe your skin.</p><br /><h3>5 Natural Remedies<br /></h3><ul><li><strong>Aloe</strong>. The inner gel of the aloe vera leaf has been shown to speed the healing of radiation-induced burns. Scoop the gel directly from split leaves or buy commercially prepared gel at a health food store or herb shop. Apply aloe gel after showering, then reapply it a few more times each day until the pain has subsided.</li><li><strong>Cucumber</strong>. The cool cucumber is often used for soothing burns, simply slice open a cucumber and wipe it directly onto your skin.</li><li><strong>Calendula</strong>. Research shows calendula flowers speed the healing of burns by stimulating the growth of new skin cells, closing wounds and reducing inflammation. You can buy commercial skin creams containing calendula at many health food stores.</li><li><strong>Plantain</strong>. Plantain contains allantoin, a proven healer of injured skin cells.</li><li><strong>Vitamin E</strong>. This nutrient is popular for anti-sunburn activity. Try a cream containing vitamin E to soothe sunburned skin.</li></ul><h3>Safe, Healthy Sunning</h3><p>It's also wise to be proactive and take steps to protect your skin from sun damage, while still making sure you still get a healthy dose of sunshine. The sun is our chief source of vitamin D, which protects us from a variety of ailments, including osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, cancer and high blood pressure. Sunscreens block UVB rays, the wavelength that stimulates the skin's vitamin D production.</p><p>Ultraviolet light from the sun comes in two types: UVB waves, which are shorter, and UVA rays, which are longer and able to penetrate skin more deeply. Many products offer no protection from UVA rays, which are responsible for skin damage and aging. According to the <a title="Environmental Working Group" href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/special/sunscreens/summary.php" target="_blank">Environmental Working Group</a>, just 16 percent of sunscreens on the market are both safe and effective at blocking both UVA and UVB radiation. In fact, a sunscreen's SPF only reflects its ability to block UVB rays.</p><p><a title="According to Michael F. Holick" href="http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/80/6/1678S.pdf" target="_blank">According to Michael F. Holick</a>, of the Boston University School of Medicine, properly applied sunscreen reduces the skin's vitamin D production by 95 percent. Holick advises knowing your skin's sensitivity, and acting accordingly. For instance, if you turn pink after 30 minutes in the summer sun, then spending five to ten minutes in the sun (in a bathing suit) should generate plenty of vitamin D. After that, apply sunscreen, cover up or seek shade.</p><h2>Sunscreen Ingredients</h2><p>And be aware that all sunscreens are not created equal. Some sunscreen ingredients can cause skin irritation, while others could disrupt your body's endocrine systems. The <a title="U.S. Food and Drug Administration" href="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/1998/398_cosm.html" target="_blank">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) regulates some sunscreen products as drugs, and some as cosmetics, which have less stringent approval requirements. While the FDA created a <a title="monograph" href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1999_register&docid=99-12853-filed" target="_blank">monograph</a> for safer sunscreens in 1999, the guidelines were never finalized.</p><p>Many environmental groups have expressed concern that certain sunscreens contain 'micronized' ingredients, or <a title="nanoparticles" href="http://www.foe.org/camps/comm/nanotech/IntroductiontonanotechnologyMay2006.pdf" target="_blank">nanoparticles</a>, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide that are manipulated to smaller particle sizes. Some research on micronized titanium dioxide indicates that it may cause more DNA damage than larger titanium dioxide particles, particularly if it enters the body through cuts or inhalation. Because nanoparticles operate on the quantum level, their behavior and absorption by the body may differ from larger particles of the same substance because they're so small. To be safe, avoid products with micronized ingredients and never apply sunscreen to cuts.</p><p>To find out which products contain the safest ingredients and provide the best sun protection, check out these useful resources:</p><ul><li><a title="Environmental Working Group's database of sunscreen products" href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/special/sunscreens/summary.php" target="_blank">Environmental Working Group's database of sunscreen products</a></li><li><a title="Environmental Working Group's Sunscreen Special Report" href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/special/sunscreens/protection.php" target="_blank">Environmental Working Group's Sunscreen Special Report</a></li><li><a title="Friends of the Earth's Nanotechnology page" href="http://www.foe.org/camps/comm/nanotech/" target="_blank">Friends of the Earth's Nanotechnology page</a></li><li><a title="The Green Guide Product Report on Sunscreens and Sunblocks" href="http://www.thegreenguide.com/reports/product.mhtml?id=27" target="_blank">The Green Guide Product Report on Sunscreens and Sunblocks</a></li><li><a title="The Green Guide: Reading the Micro-Fine Print" href="http://www.thegreenguide.com/doc/120/sunscreen" target="_blank">The Green Guide: Reading the Micro-Fine Print</a></li></ul>
