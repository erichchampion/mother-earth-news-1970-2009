        <p>Remember the 'lazy, hazy days of summer?' You can recapture thatfeeling while floating downstream or even across the pond on ahomemade raft.</p><br /><p>A 'raft' can be anything that floats and will hold a person ortwo ? an inner tube or air mattress will do. But should you desireto build an actual wooden raft, or assist a youngster in doing so,there are many resources available to help you design and build theperfect adventure craft.</p><br /><p>Many DIY rafts are constructed of found materials, such asdimension lumber or dried logs. Part of the adventure is acquiringfree materials and designing the raft to your own specifications.Held together by rope or nails and buoyed be a bit of Styrofoam,your craft can be ready for launching with just a few hours ofwork.</p><br /><p>Ishmael Wallace and his dad built a<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Home-Building/1981-03-01/How-to-Build-a-Raft.aspx" target="_blank">raft</a> using 1-inch-think planks cut 3 feet long. They attachedthe planks with 3?-inch spikes to two 3-inch-diameter logs, each 6feet long. By using more logs and planks, you could make a largerraft. But remember that once built, the raft has to be moved to thewater, so weight is a consideration.</p><br /><p>Remember Gilligan (Bob Denver) on 'Gilligan's Island?' He wasalways coming up with a plan for getting the stranded crew off theisland. His<a href="http://bobdenver.com/On_the_Radio/How_to_Build_a_Raft/how_to_build_a_raft.html" target="_blank">design</a> for a raft could hold, well, the whole crew.</p><br /><p>And for a light-weight raft that will keep you high and dry,check out<a href="http://www.captainfletch.com/projects/boats/barellraft/buildraft.asp" target="_blank">this design</a>.</p><br /><p>If you would like to try your hand at building a homemade canoe,rowboat or paddleboat, visit the <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/boats.aspx" target="_blank">Boat Page</a>.Please post a comment below about your experiences with handmadeboats or rafts.</p>
