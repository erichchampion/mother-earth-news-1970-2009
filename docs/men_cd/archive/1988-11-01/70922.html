After all, you deserve to put your bunions up after a full      day of insulating, weatherstripping, hauling firewood and      installing new storm windows. My, but isn't it satisfying      to feel ready for winter? And the signs of approaching cold      are unmistakable. The sky was so blue and the air so crisp      today that you were tempted to look for stars at noon. Now,      as the sun nuzzles the ridge line, the inevitable chill is      settling in. It'll probably drop into the teens tonight, so      the timing for the season's first fire couldn't be better.    </p>    <p>      Flames roll against the burned-clean back wall of      firebrick; shadows play from a light too subtle to be      electrical; the dog-settled at the foot of the      hearth-sighs. Today's paper is on the end table, but      the firelight is a little too dim to read by, and a lamp      would spoil the mood. Besides, the fire is entertainment      enough-especially for one who wants so little to move      even a single muscle.    </p>    <p>      Eyelids grow heavy, and soon your chin is bouncing off'      your chest. On the edge of a snooze, you have a passing      thought about taking care of the fire and closing the      window you cracked when you lit it. But there's still too      much flame to close the damper. And the window? No matter,      the new retention head-burner furnace will kick in and make      up for the heat lost.    </p>    <p>      Comforted, you fall asleep-for the last time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Terminal Cabin Fever</strong>    </p>    <p>      A melodramatic story? Perhaps, but the scene it portrays      isn't all that unusual. According to Jim White, an engineer      with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation Research      Division, around 220 North Americans die each year in      pretty much the way just described. Other scientists, such      as Joseph Lstiburek, of Building Energy Corporation,      Toronto, suggest that the toll may actually be much      higher-that hundreds more carbon monoxide-induced      deaths are being incorrectly attributed.    </p>    <p>      The cause? Backdrafting of combustion appliances located      inside houses. The details vary. It's not always a conflict      between a fireplace and a furnace. A family of eight      expired near Memphis, Tennessee, in late summer last year      when their air conditioner and gas water heater got in a      tug of war.    </p>    <p>      To be sure, even the higher estimates of fatalities are not      decimating the population as effectively as, say, the      automobile or religious wars. At least not yet. What does      cause alarm is that the trend is upward-steeply.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Where Are Pollutants Coming From?</strong>    </p>    <p>      If the only indoor source of combustiongenerated pollutants      was the outdoors, you wouldn't be reading this article.      Unfortunately, most households don't have to go shopping      for combustion products, since they are built around their      own pollution sources. Carbon-based fuels such as natural      gas, fuel oil, coal, wood, kerosene, alcohol,      tobacco-practically every substance that burns other      than hydrogen-leave behind a mixture of carbon      dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particles,      volatile organic compounds and water when they burn. A      short list of common residential refineries includes      furnaces; gas water heaters; gas, oil and kerosene space      heaters; gas ranges and ovens; woodstoves; and fireplaces.    </p>    <p>      Among the many noxious products these appliances produce,      carbon monoxide (CO) is of the most immediate concern. This      deadly gas (see the sidebar for more about its workings) is      the main reason that most combustion devices have chimneys.      (Unvented gas appliances and kerosene space heaters produce      very little CO when they're working right and are operated      correctly, although the long-term health effects of even      small amounts of the pollutant are uncertain.) Indeed, as      long as chimneys and burners work as designed, people      'don't die of carbon monoxide poisoning in their own homes.      But chimneys and appliances don't always work right, and      people are dying. Many more are sick.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Why Is CO Staying in Houses?</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the first questions that comes to mind when one      learns of the increase in the incidence of carbon monoxide      poisoning is: Why now? Houses have had furnaces for more      than a century and fireplaces for most of a millennium.      What has changed?    </p>    <p>      As you'll soon learn, there are many factors that can      conspire to foul indoor air, but the root of the      problem-the basic design rule that has      changed-is that modern houses are prone to operate at      lower air pressure than older ones. Often, the air pressure      indoors is significantly lower than that outdoors, and if      the level of depressurization exceeds the strength of      chimney draft-at best, a modest force in a      natural-draft chimney-the flue will work backwards.      The chimney will serve as the air inlet, and the deadly gas      will be exhausted into the house-a phenomenon called      backdrafting. What sorts of influences can bring      depressurization to a crucial point? Here's a partial list:    </p>    <p>      <strong>1. Weatherization:</strong> Because of efforts to      reduce air leakage, it takes less to depressurize a modern      house than a turn-of-the-century residence. Homes built      between about 1940 and 1975 in northern climates are about      onethird as leaky as the previous housing stock. According      to Gory Nelson of the Minneapolis Blower Door Company      (which builds equipment for testing house leakage), the      average new Minneapolis home can reach a serious level of      depressurization under the influence of a fireplace or a      large exhaust fan. And a tight, energy-efficient home may      be depressurized by a single bathroom exhaust fan.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2.</strong> <strong>Fireplaces:</strong> When a      fireplace is burning actively, it draws as much as 600      cubic feet per minute (cfm) of air from a home-easily      enough to backdraft other combustion appliances. Even more      serious, the fireplace's natural draft drops as the fire      burns down. It may win the battle of depressurization early      in the burn, backdrafting other appliances, and then begin      backdrafting itself later, during the charcoal phase, when      the carbon monoxide concentrations are highest.    </p>    <p>      Fireplaces are one thing that all the experts dealing with      backdrafting agree on: If a modern house is to have one      (and if it is to be used), a fireplace should have an ample      outside air source and should be equipped with      tight-fitting doors that are closed as soon as the flames      begin to die.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3.</strong> <strong>Indoor barbecues and      kitchen-island exhaust fans:</strong> Modern houses have      many exhaust fans, some of which are very powerful. Jim      White says that the two most potent inhalers of house air      are indoor barbecues and kitchen-island exhaust fans.      Typically, neither type of device is fitted with an outside      air source, so they suck 400 to 600 cfm of air out of the      house. No natural-draft burner can overcome this level of      depressurization in even an average home. When the exhaust      fan is operating, the furnace, gas water heater, woodstove,      and the fireplace, too, will work backwards. White cites      examples where the suction has bowed picture windows in to      the extent that images distort.    </p>    <p>      Attempts to fit indoor barbecues and island exhaust fans      with their own air inlets are impractical unless the      retrofit incorporates an intake fan comparable to the      exhaust fan. To provide natural make-up air to the average      indoor barbecue fan, you'd need a hole about 32 inches in      diameter. When 23 Canadian building code and standard      committees convened in Ottawa in October to consider      regulations to control backdrafting and spillage, indoor      barbecues and other large exhaust fans were high up on the      list for discussion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4. Smaller exhaust fans acting in concert:</strong>    </p>    <p>      In order of the volume of air they expel from a building      (after indoor barbecues and island fans), clothes dryers      (about 200 cfm), furnaces (about 120 cfm), standard range      hoods (about 100 cfm), bathroom ex haust fans (50 to 80      cfm), woodstoves (less than 50 cfm) and gas water heaters      (about 40 cfm) all can contribute to depressurization.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5. More-efficient and smaller furnaces:</strong>      Most of the improvements in furnace efficiencies achieved      in the last decade have come from more-effective heat      extraction. As a result, flue gas temperatures are lower      and draft is reduced proportionately. In fact, draft is so      threatened by low exhaust temperature that the      most-efficient furnaces now have fans to remove the waste      products. It's the middle ground where problems can arise.      A chimney that was marginal with a 65%-efficient      furnace-because it was too large or was leaky or was      on a cold outside wall-may not work at all at 80%      efficiency.    </p>    <p>      The problem can be magnified when a house is extensively      weatherized, reducing the need for heat, and a smaller and      more-eficient furnace is installed. The flue gases will be      cooler and their volume will be too little for the      chimney's capacity. To cope with lower flue temperatures      and smaller furnaces, natural-draft chimneys should be      built from insulated stainless steel or, even better,      insulating refractory in a size appropriate to the furnace      capacity.    </p>    <p>      In the U.S., assuming that federally mandated      minimumefficiency levels are instituted on schedule in      1992, the majority of new furnaces will have induced-draft      fans, effectively eliminating the possibility of      backdrafting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>6. Leaky forced-air furnace ductwork:</strong>      Furnace installers and homeowners usually devote a lot of      attention to sealing up furnace supply ducts, the tubes      through which hot air is pushed by the fan. Typically,      though, the return lines, through which cool air is pulled      back to the furnace, get much less attention. Consequently,      if the return ducts happen to be leaky in the furnace room,      which isn't unusual, the furnace's own fan can depressurize      the area near the furnace. In this case, you get a double      whammy: The chimney backdrafts because of the fan, and then      the fan distributes the poisons to the living area.    </p>    <p>      Well-sealed ductwork is particularly important on gas      air-conditioning systems. While in the heating mode, the      supply fan won't come on until the plenum has heated to a      set level, allowing the chimney time to establish good      flow. In air-conditioning mode, however, the distribution      fan already may be on when the burner cycles. Bear in mind,      too, that natural chimney draft is low in summer because of      warmer outside temperatures.    </p>    <p>      In general, it's unwise to run a furnace blower constantly      for any reason, though it won't be a problem as long as      neither the furnace burner nor any other combustion      appliance operates while the fan is on.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7. Leaks in the wrong parts of a house:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Wind blowing against a house creates high pressure on the      windward side and low pressure on the lee. So, even leaky      houses can become seriously depressurized if the      predominant leaks are on the downwind side. These leaks      could be intentional. Fresh-air inlets for a fireplace or      furnace or even a dryer exhaust can allow wind to pull air      from a house. And any house can become seriously      depressurized if there's a window open on the downwind      side.    </p>    <p>      Leaks at the wall-ceiling junction are also likely to      encourage depressurization, since they help the house to      act like a good chimney. This effect is more pronounced in      a multistory house, simply because it's taller. Likewise,      open windows on the second story (and particularly      downwind) may further increase depressurization.    </p>    <p>      Gary Nelson has also noticed an interesting phenomenon in      three Minnesota houses he's investigated. All three were      fitted with power attic ventilators in attempts to solve      moisture problems in insulation. According to Nelson, the      moisture was coming from the house through holes in the      ceiling, so exhausting air from the attic only increased      the leakage rate. Not surprisingly, increasing the leakage      rate increased depressurization, and all three houses had      backdrafting problems.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8. Unsafe practices:</strong>    </p>    <p>      There aren't, and aren't likely to be, regulations      prohibiting a homeowner from a foolhardy practice such as      heating the kitchen with a gas range turned on high.      Likewise, heating systems about which many scientists are      skeptical, such as unvented space heaters, are quite      common.    </p>    <p>      (Bruce Eugene Davis, Housing Director of the Economic      Opportunity Agency of Washington County, Arkansas, reports      that 12% of the houses in his state have unvented heaters,      and he has found CO in the exhaust streams of 19% of the      units he's tested.)    </p>    <p>      As for misusing an appliance such as a gas range to heat a      space, we can adamantly say don't! But whether you want to      have an unvented combustion appliance in your house at all      (be it a range, an oven or a gas, oil or kerosene heater)      is another matter entirely. You should be aware, however,      that even in the absence of carbon monoxide, such an      appliance could be contributing to chronic health problems      your family members may have. (Canadian researchers are      finding out alarming things about certain fungi that      flourish in the damp environment often produced by unvented      space heaters.) And should an unvented heater malfunction,      it could be life-threatening.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What to Do</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you have a woodstove or an oil furnace that backdrafts,      you're probably aware of it. Wood smoke is visible and      fuel-oil furnaces provide a telltale whiff of sulfur to the      nose. Unfortunately, gas appliances don't offer such ready      hints. In any event, if backdrafting has been occurring      often in a fossil-fuel burner, there should be some signs      on the appliance itself. On an oil-burner, look for soot      smudges around the draft control (a T in the exhaust from      the furnace that has a freeswinging flap).    </p>    <p>      If they're extensive, you've been having at least some      spillage. On a gas furnace or water heater, look at the      outlet from the unit. There will be a cone-shaped hood      there that admits extra air to the chimney to stabilize      draft, and soot will show up around it if the appliance has      been backdrafting significantly. Even if you find no signs      that your furnace or water heater has been backdrafting,      it's a good idea to perform the simple tests described in      the sidebar. If one or more of your combustion appli ances      is backdrafting for longer than about 30 seconds at      start-up, you should fix the problem.    </p>    <p>      As long as the heater is correctly tuned, the situation      isn't life-threatening. But poor air quality may already be      causing health problems-sore throats, irritation to      nostrils and eyes and asthmalike symptoms-and may be      making the indoor environment overly humid. If you ignore      the problem, the performance of the burner will      deteriorate, and the situation could well become deadly.      Experts take two approaches to solving backdrafting      problems: One method goes after the mechanism of      backdrafting; the other eliminates sources. The potential      for backdrafting can be controlled by balancing indoor and      outdoor air pressure with a fan that pushes air into the      house. Jim White points out that air will get into the      building anyway, so it may be best to heat it and push it      in intentionally. Source control, as advocated by Lstiburek      and Nelson, is done by a procedure called aerodynamic      uncoupling. Fortunately, this isn't as complex as it first      sounds.    </p>    <p>      It simply means that anything that burns fuel gets its      supply air from the outdoors and dumps its waste back out      there. For the purposes of combustion, the furnace, water      heater, gas dryer and woodstove or fireplace all operate a      "they were outdoors. The first three can s 11 be exhausted      with a power venter, which can be plumbed to handle all the      burners at once. (Tjernlund Products offers such equipment,      as well as inexpensive sensors that will shut off a      backdrafting appliance. Call 800/ 255-4208 for      information.)    </p>    <p>      Fireplaces, if they're used, should have outside air inlets      inside the fire chamber and well-sealed glass doors.      Woodstoves are difficult to retrofit with outside air      supplies, but models built for mobile homes come so      equipped. One advantage of utilizing aerodynamic uncoupling      over pressure neutralization is that major exhaust devices      (like indoor barbecues) are no longer a problem, since      there are no pollutants to be drawn in. In addition, in      colder climates, infiltration (air moving into the house      through the walls) is preferred to exfiltration (air moving      out through the walls) because water vapor in the indoor      air can cause problems if it condenses inside a wall.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Forensics</strong>    </p>    <p>      By now you should have a pretty good idea what causes      backdrafting and how to stop it. But, as a final exam, see      if you can figure out what happened to you back in our      bedtime story. Don't peek below until you've figured out      your explanation. Here's how we stacked the deck against      your surviving the first four paragraphs. First, you spent      the day messing with the air leakage characteristics of the      building. That new furnace might have worked acceptably in      the old leaky building, even though it's not cold enough to      produce really strong draft, but the addition of caulk and      storm windows has thrown it a curve. There's a hearty fire      in the fireplace and that chimney is drawing correctly as      you go to sleep. The cracked window on the downwind side is      fighting against it-but it isn't winning yet. Later      in the evening, the balance in the tug of war changes.    </p>    <p>      The fire burns down some, enough to let the thermostat call      for heat from the furnace. Sure enough, it backdrafts, but      it's in good tune and there's not much CO being produced.      (Later in the heating season, should someone else take up      residence, the performance will deteriorate under the      adverse conditions.) You're asleep, so you don't notice the      odor. Later still, the fire dies to its charcoal phase,      producing lots of carbon monoxide and very little draft.      It's chilly with that open window encouraging infiltration,      though. Soon the flow reverses in the fireplace chimney,      spilling CO-laden air into the room. Less than an hour      later it's all over.    </p>    <p>      <strong>C0: THE INVISIBLE KILLER</strong>    </p>    <p>      WHEN CARBON-CONTAINING FUELS oxidize (burn) with air, they      create hundreds of new compounds. Many of these waste      products are dangerous, but only the simplest of      them-carbon monoxide (CO)-is likely to occur in      concentrations that immediately jeopardize health. Because      of the deadly gas's tremendous affinity for blood in the      lungs (an affinity more than 200 times that of oxygen), it      readily steps in the way of the life-giving gas and denies      cells their breath. People who die from exhaust fumes in      cars or from smoke inhalation in fires suffocate from      carbon monoxide poisoning. Luckily for us, carbon monoxide      normally makes up only a very small part of Earth's      atmosphere-about 1/10 of a part per million (ppm).    </p>    <p>      Because there are so many devices in urban areas that burn      carbon fuels, though, CO usually lingers there in the 5- to      10-ppm range and may exceed 10 times that level near busy      highways. CO begins to affect hu mans after we've been      exposed to as little as 15 ppm over eight      hours-causing minor confusion and loss of sense of      time-and at 1070 (that's 10,000 ppm) it kills in 10      to 20 minutes. Combine carbon monoxide's extreme toxicity      with the difficulty of detecting it (the gas is colorless,      odorless and tasteless at all but the highest      concentrations) and the subtlety of its symptoms (victims      of acute CO poisoning typically lose consciousness without      recognizing the seriousness of their distress), and you      have a prescription for accidental death. But even      comparatively small concentrations of carbon monoxide      present serious long-term health hazards.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TESTING FOR BACKDRAFTING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Though sophisticated instruments are required to accurately      measure the potential for backdrafting in a house, you can      perform a "worst-case" test of your own with nothing more      than a finger for a test instrument. There are two stages      to the test, the procedures for which we've adapted from      recommendations by CMHC, Gary Nelson and Joseph Lstiburek.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Furnace Return Test</strong>    </p>    <p>      Close all outside doors and windows. Shut the door between      the furnace room and the rest of the building, and turn on      the furnace fan (no need for the burner). Using a portable      smoke source (an incense stick or cigarette) inside the      furnace room, look for air movement under or around doors.      If the smoke trails toward the furnace, you've got return      ductwork leaks that need repair.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Basic Depressurization Test</strong>    </p>    <p>      On a mild, still day, close all exterior doors and windows.      At a time when the furnace hasn't run for several hours,      turn on every exhaust device in the house (kitchen and bath      fans, dryer, water heater, attic    </p>    <p>      and wholehouse fans) and open all possible doors between      the furnace and the rooms where the exhausts are located.      Keep all other interior doors closed. Go to the furnace      room and have someone else turn on the furnace at the      thermostat. Feel at the draft control on an oil furnace or      the draft hood on a gas furnace for the heat of a backward      flow in the chimney. Redo the test on gas water heaters and      gas dryers after they've had a chance to cool thoroughly.      If spillage continues for longer than about 30 seconds on      any combustion appliance, you could have a problem.    </p>
