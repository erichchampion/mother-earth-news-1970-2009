            		<p><strong>ELECTION '88</strong></p>        <p>      It's only one of many issues dividing Bush and Dukakis, but      it's also an issue on which they've both tried to hang      their hats.    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Kathleen Seabe</h5>    <p>      ONE OF THE BIGGEST SURPRISES OF this year's presidential      election has been the emphasis placed by both candidates      upon environmental concerns. Both Vice President Bush and      Governor Dukakis have claimed the title "environmentalist."      Therefore, though you, as voters, will have to weigh many      other factors and issues before making your choice, we've      reviewed the report researched by the League of      Conservation Voters, a nonpartisan political action      committee, and adapted it to provide this profile of the      environmental records of the candidates.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Michael Dukakis<br /></strong><br />      Governor Dukakis has initiated and supported some excellent      state environmental policies, including acid rain research,      auto emission control programs, the creation of      superfunding for hazardous waste cleanup, and the      protection of farm land from development. His      administration has also moved to monitor cancer-causing      pesticides, opposed the Seabrook nuclear plant on the      grounds of its unworkable evacuation plan and taken many      steps to safeguard the New England coast.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Budget and appointments</strong>    </p>    <p>      Dukakis has, observers claim, made some weak appointments      to key environmental posts, has-especially during his      second term-occasionally favored economic development      over environmental causes and has sometimes been slow to      implement existing legislation. His overall environmental      record, however, is commendable.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Air pollution, climate, acid rain</strong> A strong      advocate of acid rain control, Dukakis spearheaded the New      England Governors' Conference's proposal for a national      control strategy, and backed a related bill in the      Massachusetts state legislature. He now claims to support a      12 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions but,      in the past, participated in laying the ground work for the      Proxmire Bill which calls for only a 10-million-ton      reduction and has generated opposition from      environmentalists. In other clean-air-related actions,      Dukakis supported an effective auto emissions program, but      has not always been as quick to enforce standards for large      incinerators and industrial polluters. He's gone on record      as promising to phase out the use of substances      contributing to the greenhouse effect.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Water pollution, toxics, solid waste</strong></p><p>      Dukakis successfully lobbied for a bill giving the state      the right to impose penalties on polluters without going to      court. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health was      also among the first to ban several cancer causing      pesticides. The governor's stated goal is for Massachusetts      to, "in the near future," recycle 25% of its solid wastes      and burn not more than 50%. Five recycling centers are      projected.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Energy</strong></p><p>The governor blocked the opening of      New Hampshire's Seabrook nuclear power plant (on the      grounds that an adequate emergency evacuation plan was      impossible) and has been a constant force in prohibiting      oil leasing off the New England coast. He has also endorsed      energy conservation and renewable sources of      energy-in part by budgeting $10 million for a      photovoltaic research center and by encouraging the use of      co-generation. Massachusetts is ranked third in the nation      for its renewable energy programs. Dukakis not only      pioneered a state law setting energy efficiency standards      for appliances but also lobbied Congress to keep those      regulations in federal law.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Public land and land use</strong></p><p>After backing      several innovative land preservation programs (he is      responsible for the "largest open space land acquisition      program in the history of the nation"), Dukakis endorsed a      Land Bank bill which would have allowed "communities to      impose a real estate transfer tax to provide revenue for      housing and open space." (The bill died in the      legislature.) Environmentalists have, however, frowned upon      some of his state forest management practices, especially      with regard to road planning, and disapprove of his      failure, thus far, to stop the downtown Boston Fan Pier      high-rise, which would block prime waterfront to easy      public access.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Water resources, coastline, wetlands</strong></p><p> As      part of his stance against offshore oil drilling, Dukakis      fought in federal court to protect one of the richest      fisheries in the United States. He also instigated a      powerful coastal zone management program and new tidewater      regulations providing better beach access and has endorsed      an impressive wetlands protection program. (The latter has,      however, been weakly enforced due to inadequate funding.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>George Bush</strong></p><p>Vice President Bush's record      is a bit harder to pin down. Years ago, as a Texas      congressman, he often supported environmental measures, but      more recently-both as a candidate in 1980 and      particularly in his role as chairperson of President      Reagan's Task Force on Regulatory Relief-he has, for      the most part, supported industry over environmental      concerns.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Budget and regulations</strong></p><p>The Task Force on      Regulatory Relief was set up to prevent business from being      "regulated to death" by environmental legislation. One of      Bush's early acts as chairperson was to recommend that the      Office of Management and Budget (OMB) be given veto power      over environmental regulations. Industry leaders were asked      to list the federal regulations they wanted weakened or      rescinded. The resulting "hit list" eventually led to the      watering down of EPA regulations on pesticide registration,      testing of potentially toxic substances, air pollution and      hazardous waste control. On the other hand, Bush-an      active outdoorsman-has been more attentive to land      and wildlife conservation programs. He lobbied for the      creation of the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund to restore      declining sport fisheries populations, supported      international research on ozone depletion and endorses the      soil conservation provisions of the 1985 farm bill.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Clean air and acid rain</strong></p><p>The Bush Task      Force urged the EPA to delay establishing auto and truck      particulate emission standards, and-under the Reagan      administration-the OMB cut back the EPA's budget for      implementing those standards which were not delayed or      weakened. The vice president also chairs a task force on      alternative fuels, which has promoted the use of ethanol      from corn and methanol from coal and natural gas. (Ethanol      and natural gas methanol can, environmentalists believe,      help control carbon monoxide and ozone levels in our      atmosphere. The production of methanol from coal, however,      produces large quantities of carbon dioxide and would      contribute to the worsening of the greenhouse effect.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Water pollution and toxics</strong></p><p>The Task Force      on Regulatory Relief also set out to weaken many toxic      chemical control regulations. In 1981 Bush announced a      continued freeze on the entire system of controlling      hazardous wastes. Also in '81, the Task Force urged a      quicker and easier pesticide approval system. The vast      majority of pesticides remain effectively untested for      possible health risks. Bush believes in financial      incentives, not imposed regulations, for pollution control.      However, he has thus far failed to develop a program to      adequately replace those regulations weakened or eliminated      by his Task Force.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Energy</strong></p><p>The vice president's record on      energy policy indicates a bias toward production rather      than conservation. His Task Force succeeded in repealing      performance standards for the weatherization of new      buildings and the Residential Conservation Service, which      provided free energy audits for homeowners. He has also      tried to repeal the Corporate Average Fuel Economy auto      regulations. Bush favors aggressive offshore oil      development and feels nuclear power is "essential,"      endorsing low liability limits for nuclear accidents. In      1986, however, he halted a DOE proposal to locate waste      sites in Maine and New Hampshire.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Public lands and wildlife</strong></p><p>As a congressman      in the 1970s, Bush voted against increased logging in      national forests and was directly responsible for the      creation of Texas's Big Thicket National Park. In 1980,      however, he supported legislation preventing the      acquisition of additional wilderness areas and criticized      the establishment of Alaskan wildlife refuges.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Water resources and private lands</strong></p><p>Bush's      position on water development issues has not, in total,      been positive. In 1983 his Task Force praised the Army      Corps of Engineers' new regulations removing 50% of all      wetlands from the protection of the Clean Water Act. It was      only after a lawsuit by environmentalists in 1984 that the      Reagan ' administration reversed those regulations.    </p>    <p>      Editor's Note: For more information, contact the League of      Conservation Voters, 2000 L St. NW, Suite 804, Washington,      DC 20036.    </p>
