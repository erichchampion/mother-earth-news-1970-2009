                <p>      <strong>EARTH DIARY</strong>    </p>        <p>      On this particular issue, the rifle association is shooting      its own foot.<br />    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Tom Turner    </h5>        <p>      THE JUNE 1988 ISSUE OF THE MAGazine American Hunter, a      publication of the National Rifle Association, carried a      provocative article concerning a lawsuit brought by the      Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund on behalf of an endangered      Hawaiian bird, the palila, and its human defenders. The      article was based on a press release from a hunters' group      called the Hawaii Wildlife Conservancy and its spokesman,      John Carroll, a Honolulu lawyer who represented a number of      Hawaiian sport hunters in the lawsuit. Having lost in      court, Mr. Carroll evidently decided to take his arguments      to the press. Given the accuracy of his press release, it's      no wonder he did not prevail in a court of law. Here's a      synopsis of the story behind the story.    </p>    <p>      The palila is a small honeycreeper, about the size of a      sparrow. It, along with most other native Hawaiian birds      and a horrifying number of endemic plants (an estimated 800      species), is endangered. Most of the plants have yet to be      placed on the federal government's endangered-species list;      the palila, however, was "listed" in 1967. The forces that      have brought so much of Hawaii's wildlife to the brink of      extinction-and pushed some species over-are      many and varied. Over half of Hawaii's original native      forests have been cleared by native Hawaiians for taro      growing and by later residents for pineapple, sugar cane      and other agricultural endeavors.    </p>    <p>      Spraying of pesticides and herbicides is a potent modern      threat. But competition from exotic (Hawaiian      conservationists prefer to call them "alien") species is      also an important cause of extinction and near extinction.      Plants and animals introduced to the islands from other      lands have competed all too successfully with native      species. The palila very nearly fell victim to this last      threat.    </p>    <p>      Three decades ago, at the instigation of sport hunters, the      Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources released on      the Big Island a strain of wild European sheep known as      mouflon, hoping that they would prosper, multiply and      become a reliable game population. The mouflon gained a      quick foothold, joining feral sheep and goats first brought      to the islands by missionaries in the late 1700s. The      introduced animals found the forage on the mid and upper      slopes of Mauna Kea volcano quite satisfactory.      Unfortunately for all concerned, the food preferred by the      interlopers-tender leaves and shoots from the native      mamane-naio forest-is precisely what the palila      requires to survive. As the population of sheep and goats      grew larger, their browsing began to tell on the forest,      suppressing new growth to the point where the palila      population began a precipitous plunge. The Endangered      Species Act, which became law in 1973, forbids the "taking"      of endangered species-taking being a catchall      expression that includes outright killing as well as      harming, harassing, trapping or wounding.    </p>    <p>      But what about willful destruction of the habitat that a      species requires for its survival? Couldn't that also be      considered a "taking"? That was the legal theory that      Michael Sherwood and the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund      used to bring the palila into a federal court to fight for      its survival. In 1978, Sherwood sued the state of Hawaii      for failing to protect the palila. The lead plaintif in the      case was the palila itself (a legal first), with the      National Audubon Society, the Hawaii Audubon Society, the      Sierra Club and a Hawaiian ornithologist named Alan C.      Ziegler as coplaintiffs. The theory (advanced for the first      time by Sherwood) was that by allowing damage to the      palila's habitat, the state of Hawaii was "taking" the      species.    </p>    <p>      Not outright killing of any individual bird, but harm to      the species as a whole that might well push it over the      brink of extinction and would certainly make its recovery      to a more healthy population size-as also required by      the Endangered Species Act-difficult if not      absolutely impossible. At the time it was pretty clear      scientifically that the feral sheep and goats were raising      hell with the palila's forest. The same could not be said      about the mouflon, but that was simply because the      scientists hadn't yet got around to studying the mouflon's      impact on the trees. Still, the lawsuit brought by Sherwood      attacked only the feral sheep and goats, expressly leaving      the mouflon out of the picture.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Shooters' groups and</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>environmentalists should be united-not      bickering.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      The state of Hawaii vigorously defended itself, saying that      no one was shooting palilas and that that was all the      Endangered Species Act forbade. A lengthy hearing was held      in federal judge Samuel P. King's court in Honolulu.      Evidence was presented from a number of scientists who had      determined that the sheep and goats were threatening the      survival and recovery of the palila. Whether that was a      violation of the law was a matter for the lawyers to argue      and the court to decide: Biologically, it was an      indisputable fact. Judge King in due course issued a      ringing opinion that supported the palila down the line.      Feral sheep and goats were indeed damaging the palila's      habitat to the detriment of the long-term prospects of the      bird, and that was illegal, he found.    </p>    <p>      The Hawaii Department of Natural Resources was in violation      of the Endangered Species Act by allowing the habitat to be      so damaged. Judge King ordered the state to remove the      feral sheep and goats. The state appealed to the Court of      Appeals, which studied the case, heard oral arguments from      Sherwood and his counterpart on the other side, and in 1981      forcefully sustained judge King, finding, as he had, that,      in violation of the law, the alien invaders were wiping out      the native forest that the birds depended on. The feral      sheep and goats were banished from the palila's range.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, scientists were documenting the impact mouflon      sheep were having on the mamane forest. To no one's      surprise, they discovered that the same thing was      happening: The mouflon were eating the palila out of house      and home, and, if something drastic wasn't done, the palila      might well vanish-perhaps within no more than 20 to      30 years. The conservationists swung into action. They made      formal request to the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural      Resources to remove the mouflons. The Department refused.      The same plaintiffs, again led symbolically by the palila      itself, threatened to sue. Eventually, they did sue, in      1985, and this time there was a full-blown, five-day trial.      The case was in most respects a carbon copy of the original      one. The plaintiffs were the same. The defendants were the      same (except that this time several Hawaii sport hunting      organizations and individuals joined the lawsuit on the      side of the state).    </p>    <p>      Many of the witnesses were the same.    </p>    <p>      The lawyer for the palila was the same. The judge was the      same. And the outcome was the same: In November 1986 Judge      King found that the mouflon sheep were harming the palila      and ordered them removed. Again the state appealed,      although its heart did not seem to be in the action, having      already spent not a few taxpayer dollars on its futile      defense of the original case. The hunters would not let the      state give up, however. On July 22, 1988, the Ninth Circuit      Court of Appeals affirmed. The hunters still seem      disinclined to give up, even in the face of defeat after      stinging defeat in various courts of law, and have      apparently decided to take their case to the public. The    </p>    <p>      <em>American Hunter</em> article is presented in a regular      column titled "Hunting-An American Tradition." It      says that the palila "might be endangered," that "the      `environmentalists' never documented a single instance of      adverse modification of... habitat showing that the      presence of mouflons `harmed' the palila . . . , "that the      judge erred seriously in his decision and that the actual      intention of "misguided environmentalists" may be "to      exterminate America's other wild game.    </p>    <p>      " The article, in short, is quite fantastic-as in      "based on fantasy." Still, the piece and the press release      it was based on have found their way into quite a few      mailboxes and newspapers by now, and could well do some      damage, since simple inaccuracy has seldom sufficed to keep      a vigorous assertion from being published or believed. The      most serious charge is that the palila is not being harmed      by the mouflon sheep. Here's what Mike Sherwood has to say      regarding that.    </p>    <p>      "Every witness who addressed this question testified that      the mouflon are in fact harming the palila because the      sheep eat mamane tree leaves, bark and, most important,      young seedlings and shoots. Mamane happens to be the      favored food item for the mouflon-the biologists      refer to it as an `ice cream' plant for the sheep.      Moreover, because there were no naturally occurring      browsing and grazing mammals in Hawaii, the mamane had no      need to evolve defenses (such as thorns, bitter-tasting      bark or poisonous sap) to browsing or grazing pressure.      Thus, as the older mamane trees are killed or die off      naturally, insufficient new trees are being allowed to grow      to maturity to replace them, and the forest declines. It is      prevention of mamane regeneration caused by the eating of      shoots and seedlings that is the critical problem. Because      the palila cannot survive without mamane, if the forest      were allowed to continue its decline, eventually the palila      would go extinct. "Virtually every witness agreed with all      this, including expert witnesses for both the state and the      hunters.    </p>    <p>      " The other charge-that "misguided environmentalists"      seek to eliminate America's wild game-is plain silly.      What the author may have meant is that environmentalists      would like to eliminate alien animals when they compete      with native creatures, especially when they are harming      those natives. Many people certainly believe that, though      it can be fiercely controversial. (Some years ago, for      example, the Park Service took steps to remove introduced      wild burros from the Grand Canyon, which proved very      unpopular in some circles.) It's a complicated issue and      deserves careful examination in each specific instance      where it arises.    </p>    <p>      The palila/mouflon situation, however, is far simpler than      most similar examples of the problem. Mouflon sheep have      resided in Hawaii for less than 30 years; there's no      longterm tradition of mouflon-hunting on Mauna Kea; and      mouflon sheep exist in several other places in Hawaii,      where they could be hunted. Finally, there may be a happy      ending to this 10-year-old legal battle: Scientists report      that the mamane-naio forest is improving nicely since the      last mouflon were removed in early 1988, and that the      palila population seems to be rebounding as well, up by as      much as 25% in the same period.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Hunters in general,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>of course, are the major source of money for the      protection of wildlife habitat, both for game and non game      species. And responsible hunters are, themselves, often      under either ignorant or unfair attack. For that side of      the story, turn to 114-098-01 .</em>    </p>
