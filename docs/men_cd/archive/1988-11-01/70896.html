                <p>      MOTHER'S CHILDREN    </p>        <p>      <em>This ferocious hunter can be a gentle pet.</em>      </p><h5 id="byline"><em>      By Laura Wendling</em>    </h5>        <p>      MATT AND LAURA WERE JUST TWO months old when Dad brought      them from the fur farm. The two ferrets were soon put to      work keeping rats out of our barn, but we liked them so      much that they've become pets, as well.    </p>    <p>      Matt and Laura may seem like strange names for ferrets, but      my dad thought the names suited them just right. He named      them after my brother and me, because they squabbled all      the way home in the car, just like the two of us.    </p>    <p>      It's been four years since Matt and Laura came to live with      us. Now we also have two of their children. We've learned a      lot about ferrets and have grown very fond of the curious      little animals. Domestic ferrets are related to the      endangered black-footed ferrets found in Wyoming, but they      are not wild animals. In fact, some people believe that the      ancient Egyptians kept tame ferrets to catch mice long      before cats were used for the job. Farmers often kept      several pairs in their barns and granaries to catch mice      and rats. And ships' captains used to let as many as two      dozen ferrets loose in the holds of their ships to catch      rats. Being small and weasel-shaped, ferrets can go right      into rat holes after their prey. They are ferocious hunters      and sometimes kill more than they need to eat.    </p>    <p>      Rats had tunneled into our own barn to eat the feed our      chickens scattered. Dad didn't want to put poison out      because he was afraid owls and snakes might eat poisoned      rats and die. And the intelligent pests were difficult to      catch in traps. So when Matt and Laura arrived, Dad let      them run through the barn's rat holes to leave their scent      in them. Then he put them in a cage in the barn.    </p>    <p>      Just their being in the barn scares rats away-we      haven't seen one in years. Life is not all work and no play      for our furry pets. Whenever we want to have fun with them,      they're ready and willing. We play outdoors when the      weather's nice. The ferrets hop forward, backward and      sideways, with their backs humped up in an inverted U      shape, all the while chattering at us. They like to dig in      the grass and look for holes to crawl into. Once Laura      crawled up my pants leg and got stuck at my knee. Her      whiskers tickled me so much I could barely keep still to      let her back out. She also likes to crawl into my coat      pocket and peek out the top while I take her for a bike      ride.    </p>    <p>      When it's cold outside, we play together in the house. We      make a ferret playground in the basement out of carpet      scraps, boxes, bags and large plastic tubes. Matt crawls      through the obstacle course and flops the carpet pieces up      with his back. When I hold him on my lap and stroke his      chin, he stretches his head back and yawns to show he likes      the attention.    </p>    <p>      Our ferrets live in pairs in all-wire rabbit cages. Inside      its cage, each pair has a wooden box measuring 10" X 12" X      12", with a four inch-round entrance hole. I pack straw      bedding in these "giant birdhouses" when the weather is      cold. I give them fresh food (dry cat food with raw      hamburger or cooked chicken gizzards for treats) and water      twice a day. They come out of their houses and wait for me      at feeding time. If I don't pick them up, they try to crawl      up my pants into my arms. They are affectionate animals and      want to be petted and played with. Laura always checks my      pockets to see if I've brought her a treat.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>" 'Laura' likes to crawl</strong></em>      <strong><em>into my coat pocket and go for a bike      ride."</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Although you can let an indoors ferret have the run of the      house, it's best if it has a cage to rest in. They sleep      about half the day and prefer resting in dark, secluded      places. (Watch out that your dad doesn't squish your pet      when he sits down in the easy chair with the evening      paper.) Ferrets also like to slip out the door when you      open it. One of my friend's ferrets snuck out the door one      afternoon and turned up the next morning-in her next-door      neighbor's bed!    </p>    <p>      Ferrets are tidy animals. Put a litter box in the corner      they habitually use for their toilet (with a sample of      their droppings in it), and they'll soon learn to use it.    </p>    <p>      They are also quiet. A ferret doesn't ordinarily make any      noise, but if you step on it or close its tail in a door,      you will discover that it does have a voice! Your ferret      may also chatter happily when you're playing with it.    </p>    <p>      Still, a ferret may not be the right pet for you. They have      to be properly cared for, just like any other pet. They      also produce a strong musky smell to attract mates. Other      ferrets may enjoy this odor, but most people don't. So you      either need to bathe a house ferret regularly or have a      veterinarian surgically remove its musk glands.    </p>    <p>      Unneutered female ferrets need to be bred during their      mating season, or they may become sick and even die. Since      we bought a male and a female, we became ferret raisers.      Females generally have one litter a year, with anywhere      from five to 10 kits (babies).    </p>    <p>      Young ferrets play rough and bite each other. They may nip      you, too, until you teach them not to (tweak their noses      and say "No" firmly). A few young ferrets nip a lot and      need to be handled with gloves until they outgrow their      nipping stage and are comfortable being handled.    </p>    <p>      I have raised about 60 young ferrets and sold them as pets      when they were eight to 10 weeks old. You can purchase them      as pets from a fur farm, pet store or small breeder, such      as myself. Be sure to get a healthy one with bright eyes,      soft (not rough and broken) fur and an active, playful      personality.    </p>    <p>      And learn all you can about them by reading a good book,      such as Wendy Winsted's <em>Ferrets</em> (T.F.H.      Publications).    </p>    <p>      I'm really glad we have ferrets in our family. They do a      good job of scaring rats out of our barn, so we don't have      to use rat poison. And, on top of that, they're the best      pets I've ever had.    </p>
