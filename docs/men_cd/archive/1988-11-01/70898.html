                <p><strong>      TO YOUR HEALTH</strong>    </p>        <p><em>      Pills to stop smokers, IQ supplement tablets, gene therapy      and more.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>When it concerns the fitness of body, mind or spirit,      the editors of</em> <em>American Health are there, staying      on top of up-to-date medical research, separating fad from      fact and helping you preserve and improve life's most      precious gift-your good health. Here are just a few      items culled from recent and upcoming issues, including the      possibility of a dynamic new vegetable      variety.<br /></em><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>High-Tech Hand Washer</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      A futuristic device originally designed to scrub surgeons'      hands is now being tested on fast-food cooks and even gooey      day-care children.    </p>    <p>      It's like something from "The Jetsons": Just poke your arms      through the gadget's two holes, then step on a pedal.      Automatically, splash guards inflate, sealing in hands and      forearms as oscillating jets spray an antimicrobial      cleansing solution. Release the pedal and the guards      deflate.    </p>    <p>      One version, the Insta-Clens ($1,750 from Pacific      Biosystems), has been tested in a Phoenix day-care center      where "the kids were a little scared of it at first, but by      day two they couldn't keep their hands off it." The machine      promises to do more than just keep kids tidy. Teaching      tykes clean habits could cut many day-care-spread      infections, including some that cause infant diarrhea.      Insta-Clens is also being tested in the kitchens of two      Phoenix fast-food restaurants.Getting kitchen help to wash      their hands is vital: Hepatitis, salmonella and      staphylococcus can all be transmitted by unclean cooks.    </p>    <p>      The original operating-room model, called Stat Scrub      ($19,500), has been tested at a Phoenix hospital. According      to one study, the 90-second wash got hands 65% cleaner than      surgeons' usual 10-minute pre-op scrub. A smaller version,      Medi-Clens, is being used at a neonatal intensive care      unit. Though it doesn't provide the immaculate scrub that      surgeons require, it may surffice for between patient      contacts. Ideally, there would be such a machine in every      patient's hospital room, but at $2,950 each, Medi-Clens      units probably would be scattered along corridors.    </p>    <p>      Anything that reminds hands-on care givers to wash up      between visits is potentially very important. Studies show      that forgetful doctors frequently carry germs from patient      to patient. And in a study of 400 fourth-year med students      at five northeastern medical colleges, up to 96% didn't      wash their hands between simulated doctor-patient      examinations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cold-Blooded Women</strong> For many people,      particularly women, even a slightly cool environment can be      a chilling experience. They get cold quickly and warm up      slowly. One reason may be that they're iron deficient. In a      Penn State University study, when both anemic and nonanemic      women were submerged up to their necks in water that was      slightly cooler than body temperature, the iron-deficient      women weren't able to cope well with the temperature      change. After 100 minutes, they were using less oxygen,      which translates into less body heat, and producing less      thyroid hormone, which is one of the body's temperature      regulators. They also had lower core body temperatures.      When the test was repeated after 12 weeks of iron      supplementation, the anemic women showed normal temperature      control.    </p>    <p>      Considering that over 30% of all women aged 11 to 50      consume less than the recommended 18 milligrams of iron      every day, it's believed that cold intolerance is a common      problem for females. Yet, a physician can take a simple      blood test to determine anemia-and advise whether      iron supplements are a good idea. Iron is also found in      such foods as lean steak, poultry (dark meat), shellfish      (especially clams, oysters and mussels), tuna (dark meat)      and beans. Drinking orange juice and eating vitamin C-Rich      foods with meals enhances iron absorption.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Can vitamin pills actually increase human      intelligence?</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Smarts in a Bottle</strong>    </p>    <p>      In England, sales of vitamins and minerals soared after the      BBC reported on a study indicating that vitamin and mineral      supplements might raise the IQ. The study, published in the      British medical journal <em>The Lancet</em> , found that      supplemented children performed better on nonverbal      intelligence tests-tasks such as matching colored      blocks to a preset pattern. Researchers believe that      nonverbal IQ is a more innate, biological measure than      verbal IQ, which depends more on formal learning and      language.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, nutrition would be expected to affect nonverbal      results before changes could show up on verbal tests.      Though relatively few children in the U.S. or Britain have      marked nutritional deficiencies, many do consume diets that      are low in iron and zinc, both of which are important to      brain cell production. A recent study has also implicated      zinc deficiency as a risk factor in dyslexia. The B      vitamins support brain function, too-and may be low      in some kids' diets.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Carotene Cauliflower</strong>    </p>    <p>      A small, mutant, orange cauliflower head found in a field      near Toronto may be the source of a new cauliflower variety      rich in vitamin A. Cornell University scientists are      currently crossing the cultivar-which gets its orange      color from carotene, as do carrots and pumpkins-with      standard varieties, to create a variety suitable for      farming. Cauliflower, a member of the reputedly cancer      preventive cruciferous family, is already high in fiber,      vitamin C and potassium.    </p>    <p>      <strong>At-Home Cholesterol Tests?</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you think cholesterol consciousness is at an all-time      high, just wait until the first at home cholesterol tests      hit drugstore shelves. Home Diagnostics (Eden town, New      Jersey) is ready now with an easy-to-use finger-stick kit      (pending FDA approval), and Keystone Medical Corporation      (Columbia, Maryland) will seek an OK from the FDA in the      fall. Chem-Elec (North Webster, Indiana), whose Clinicard      won FDA approval in June as the first self-processing      <em>doctor's</em> office screening test, will probably join      the over-the-counter bandwagon, too.    </p>    <p>      Sounds convenient, but what about accuracy? The Clinicard      doesn't give results exact enough for a doctor's diagnosis,      says the FDA. It does, however, give readings within three      ranges: below 200 mg/dl (desirable level), 200 to 300      (borderline to high), and above. (The cards show 25 mg/dl      gradations.) Manufacturers say the home kits are only      screening devices, and not meant to replace lab tests      (which are deemed "accurate" if they're within 150% of the      true reading).    </p>    		<p>     <strong>Gene-Therapy Taboos</strong>      </p>    <p>      Gene-Therapy Taboos Long ago, gene doctors agreed that gene      therapy on fertilized eggs and embryos was off limits as      far as humans are concerned. Reason: Once a gene is      inserted into a fertilized egg, it becomes incorporated      into every cell -including the sex cells. And that      means the extra gene would be passed on to all future      progeny-even offspring that don't need it.      (Sanctioned gene-therapy would always target specific      tissue to eliminate any and all possibilities of novel      genes being passed on to future generations.)    </p>    <p>      Even though animal studies suggest that doctors could, for      example, eventually wipe out insulin-dependent (type I)      diabetes by inserting an insulin-producing gene in embryos,      scientists worldwide have agreed not to try. The risk of      mucking up the human gene pool is simply too high.    </p>    <p>      Another gene-therapy taboo is "eugenic" genetic      engineering. That line of research would involve      genetically altering such traits as intelligence,      personality and organ formation. But rest assured, says a      National Academy of Sciences report, these traits are      controlled by hundreds, perhaps thousands, of interacting      genes. "The genes involved have not been identified.      Furthermore, scientists do not have the tools to manipulate      these complex traits, and do not expect to have them in the      foreseeable future."    </p>
