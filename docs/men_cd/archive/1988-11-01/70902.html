            		<p><strong>SEASONS OF THE GARDEN </strong></p>        <p>      The tortoise and the hare.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>        <p>      ACCORDING TO EXERCISING Ex pert Dr. Ronald LaPorte, flashy      joggers often lose to slow-but-steady gardeners in the      "race" to better physical fitness. Why? Because running      workouts demand too much effort and commitment, resulting      in a high dropout rate. The more moderate (and productive!)      effort of gardening attracts and holds far more people.      LaPorte figures that "The Victory Garden" is the best      exercise show on TV and offers his own simple formula for      health: "I'd like to give everyone a garden."    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Rose Disease Is a Rose Disease . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      Exactly one year ago in this column, we briefly mentioned a      disease called rose rosette that afflicts-and often      kills-multiflora roses. (Symptoms include bright red      stems and leaves, thick branches, bleached flowers and      extra thorns.) Since then, we've received dozens of      information requests from readers eager to use a little      biological warfare on the pesky briar. Well, don't plan on      "poxing" those plants just yet. According to U.S.      Department of Agriculture scientists, the disease can      strike <em>cultivated</em> roses, as well.    </p>    <p>      Rosette was first noticed in 1941 on wild roses in the      western U.S. and has since spread to much of the Midwest.      The disease has attacked some cultivated roses in the      Midwest, but apparently not in the West and Southwest. Why?      No one knows. Researchers are trying to develop reliable      techniques for limiting the spread of the disease (it is      apparently transmitted by the mite <em>Phyllocoptes      fructiphilus</em> ).    </p>    <p>      But for now, please don't attempt to import rosette into      your area-the risk to cultivated roses is just too great.      Rather, USDA scientists recommend that you <em>remove</em>      any multiflora roses with rosette symptoms.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Research Briefs</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>However, a foam chip is not a foam chip . .      .</strong>    </p>    <p>      McGill University researchers found that some white packing      chips work well when added to potting mixes (for promoting      aeration and drainage), but certain kinds can be toxic to      plants. So use any foam chips on a trial basis at first,      keeping an eye out for wilted or yellowed foliage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Snowed-under Christmas trees.</strong> So you've      decided on a live Christmas tree this year-but how      will you keep it healthy until you can plant it next      spring? If you live in the snow belt, take a tip from      Canadian researchers: Just move the tree outdoors and cover      it completely (not just the roots) with snow. A greenhouse      or just-below-freezing chamber also works well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>No picnic for whiteflies.</strong> Want a durable      yet very inexpensive way to trap those whiteflies that      infest your indoor plants? Smear some petroleum jelly on      both sides of a few yellow plastic picnic plates and hang      them near the plants with string or wire.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cool tropics.</strong> Experiments have shown that,      contrary to popular advice, cool water (between 50° and      86°F) is OK for irrigating tropical foliage plants.      Cold (36°) water, though, does promote leaf dropping.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Arnold Schwarzenseed?</strong> Fact or      folklore-do germinating seeds really exert enough      force to crack sidewalks? No way, say Cornell      experimenters. After testing nine kinds of vegetable seeds,      they found that even snap beans, the mightiest of the lot,      produced less than a pound of push per seed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kudos for Chemlawn!</strong> A year ago, the giant      lawn care company quietly decided to stop using 2,4-D      herbicide. Banning the controversial pesticide was      reportedly "an expensive decision," but it has improved the      company's insurance rates and ability to recruit new      employees.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bravo for Burpee!</strong> The largest mail-order      company in the U.S. has withdrawn all woodland wildflowers      and native ferns from its catalogues, to keep from selling      plants collected from the wild. In the future, Burpee will      sell only nursery-propagated plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gleanings</strong> In <em>Gray Water Use in the      Landscape</em> , ediblelandscaping expert Robert Kourik      shows one way to combat garden drought: Redirect "gray"      water (from showers, tubs, sinks and laundry drains) to      outdoor planting beds. The 26-page booklet costs $6 from      Edible Productions, P.O. Box 1841, Santa Rosa, CA 95402 . .      . . <em>The</em> <em>Garden Seed Inventory: Second      Edition</em> ($17 postpaid from SSE, R.R. 3, Box 239,      Decorah, IA 52101) is the definitive source list for      nonhybrid vegetables (especially rare and endangered ones)      . . . . The "Edible Wild Plants" videotape ($39.95 from      Media Methods, 24097 N. Shore Dr., Edwardsburg, MI 49112)      shows how to identify, gather and prepare dozens of tasty      wild edibles ....

In the tradition of Masanobu      Fukuoka (author of One-Straw Revolution), French agronomist      Marc Bonfils has developed methods for growing food crops      in polycultures without tillage.
