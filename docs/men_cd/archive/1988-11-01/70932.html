                <p><strong>      LAST LAUGH</strong>    </p>    				 <p>      Well, sir, leaf-peepin' season, the time o' year when      caravans of city folks drive 'round starin' at fall-colored      trees, hez been hard upon Plumtree Crossin' fer weeks now.      Still, the fellers of the Plumtree Crossin' Genial Assembly      weren't expectin' the dog-an'tourist story Lafe Higgins      brought by the other day.    </p>    <p>      Ever'body knew the pooch in question, the biggest, meanest      speciment of dog seen in these parts since Clarence      Smithers' hound choked on a steer's head. It wuz a cross,      Newt Blanchard claimed, between a horse fer size an' a      piana fer teeth, if someone hed filed the keys to a p'int,      an' its eyes wuz as evil as cream o' sin. Bark? Heck no,      the dog seemed to say, the chain makes enough noise when I      come fer ya. Seems as if Lafe's uncle, who owns the      junkyard over to Erosion junction, hed to go into the city      last Sunday, an' he left his collection o' dead cars an'      school buses in the paws o' this aforementioned      dog-name o' Juggler, on accounta his fondness fer      thet partickalar hose inside the human neck.    </p>    <p>      Unc Higgins hez hed thet dog since it were a pup thet      weighed only a couple hunnert pounds. Seems as though he      weren't perzackly a watchdog so much as a air-breathin'      shark. Now thet day, Lafe was workin' in the shop next to      the Edsel cemetery, on a of '53 Hudson he's jist about      weaned offa oil, when this humongous motorin' home come up      the road. It pulled up, wheezin' like a gunny sack fulla      bagpipe parts, an' stopped. This cityslicker opened the      window an' whispered, "Hey, how far to the freeway, bub?"      Lafe slid out, an' dusted off his back as he thought about      thet, an' finally allowed thet it wuz only 80 mile as the      crow flies, but if the crow hed to drive 'er, it would be      closer to a lot more. Thet fact let the air outa the      slicker, an' he run his smooth hands over his curly hair,      tugged on the bill of his admiral's cap an' said a word you      jist don't hear much around Plumtree on Sundays. Lafe was      fixin' to go back under the Hudson when the slice o' city      life inquired if he hed a dewhizulator on hand to fix his      busted offgrommatoon. Lafe, who can diagnose an' identify      every vehicle ailment known to man, just gave a loud snort.    </p>    <p>      "Shhh! My wife's in back sleeping," the slicker hissed,      "and she doesn't need to know I took a wrong turn. If you      can fix this thing, it's worth 20 bucks extra to me." Lafe      peered inside fer two seconds, an' pernounced, "You need a      new rascalatin' arm fer yore zipperwheel, an' if you wanna      wait until the boss gits back, there's one on thet there      bus." He jerked a thumb at a big yeller wreck behind the      junkyard fence. The city dude jist shook his head.    </p>    <p>      "Listen, sport, make it 50 bucks if you can do it in half      an hour. My wife already thinks I can't read a map, and I      want to be back on pavement before she wakes up. Why wait      for the boss?" And he peeled U.S. Grant off a roll thet      looked like it come from a Pentagon toilet stall, holdin'      it up like a kid's first fish. But Lafe weren't even      tempted. He pointed back to where ol' Juggler wuz chawin'      up rib bones like they wuz pretzels, an' said in a voice he      saved fer funerals, "Thet's why, mister. Dead men don't      need money much, an' to tell the truth, I don't feel real      safe in plain sight like this, bein' as how thet dog ain't      tasted no human flesh fer a while, an' only a rusty anchor      chain aholdin' him." The dinosaur pilot smiled at Lafe an'      went to the back o' the metal Conestogy. Pretty soon he      brung out a chunka hamburger the size of a cannon shot.      "OK, this should knock him out," he laughed, tossin' thet      beefy ball inside the danger zone o' the dog's tether. "I      put in a few of the wife's tranquilizers.    </p>    <p>      " Juggler sorta inhaled it down so as not to get his      sparklin' teeth dirty, an' wiped his chops with a tongue      like a pink razor strop. Sure enough, in two minnits      juggler keels over and commences to snore, so Lafe said a      few prayers, gathered up his tools an' streaked fer the      bus, the city feller right behind him. "We gotta work      fast," Lafe panted, whippin' of the bus hood an' yankin'      out parts, " 'cause we ain't safe long as thet dog hez      breath in his body." It took him only 110 seconds o' rapid      wrench-twiddlin' to free up the rascalatin' arm, an' one      more to race back outa the yard. Thet son o' suburbia wuz      laughin' at Lafe's keenish love o' life, as he moseyed      right past juggler's food bowl, callin', "You worry too      much, hayseed.    </p>    <p>      This dog can't hurt-" an' thet's as far as he got"      'Cause Juggler reared up, eyes closed but teeth bared, an'      chomped a mouthful o' pant leg. He wuz somnambulatin' so      hard thet the sudden screamin' didn't even wake      him-but his steel jaw wuz locked. The dude came outa      those pants like a banana outa its peel, an' skivvied the      50 feet back to his roadhoggin' house, slammed the door an'      locked her.    </p>    <p>      Lafe's itemized bill (he finished the job in half the time,      since his adrenaline wuz still drippin' like warm-spell      maple sap) included: parts, one dollar; labor, two dollars;      enough likker to stop his hand shakin', three dollars; an'      the 50 dollars danger pay as promised. He slid the bill      under the door, an' the money slid out, an' the motorin'      home fired up an' took off like a square missile.    </p>    <p>      'Bout a month later, a letter come, registered an' special      dee-livery, askin' Lafe to please send by return mail the      wallet thet wuz in them pants. Natcherly, Lafe sent back a      nice reply explainin' thet said wallet wuz all over the      yard, but not to worry about the credit cards 'cause they      wuz no longer usable. An' if he wanted proof, it would have      to ar rive in a mailin' tube.    </p>    <p>      - Jeff Taylor    </p>
