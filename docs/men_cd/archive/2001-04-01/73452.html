                    <h5 id="byline">      by Jeff Persons    </h5>        <p>      <em>A 75% savings on energy bills is<br />      right under your feet.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>That said,</em> <em>MOTHER</em> <em>and Jeff Persons,      owner of Geo-Source One in Dublin, Ohio, would like to      introduce the most energy-efficient and cost-effective way      to heat, cool and produce domestic hot water: geothermal      energy. This type of power is literally and figuratively a      groundbreaking way to reduce your electricity bills by      actually using the temperature of the earth to heat and      cool your home. Basically, all you need to get started is      some polyethylene pipe, a compressor in the basement and a      hole in the ground, and you'll save up to 75% on monthly      electricity bills! - Sam Martin</em>    </p>    <h3>      EXCHANGING HEAT WITH THE PLANET    </h3>    <p>      One of the most frequent comments we hear from our      customers who have switched from conventional heating      systems to geothermal is that the system's so quiet they      cannot tell if it's operating. Many customers tell me they      feel the need to check the thermostat and system in the      basement to be certain that everything is still working.      (Another thing they often say is, "we only wish we had      decided to switch to geothermal long ago.")    </p>    <p>      Since soil temperatures several feet below the surface      remain at a nearly constant 50°F year round, the earth      actually acts as a massive low temperature solar storage      unit - cooler than surface temperatures in the summer,      warmer than the surface in the winter. Geothermal energy,      also known as geoexchange, is literally the transfer and      storage of heat from the earth.    </p>    <p>      Similar to your kitchen refrigerator, a residential      geoexchange system uses water or a nontoxic refrigerant      that circulates through a ground loop where it absorbs      heat. A compressor then amplifies this heat to a higher      useful temperature before rejecting the heat through a      finned heat-exchange coil into the household duct system.      This system also allows the cooled refrigerant to flow into      an expansion valve so that a "reversing valve" can      automatically change the direction of refrigerant flow to      provide air conditioning. Many residential systems also      incorporate a small auxiliary heat exchanger called a      desuperheater to heat the domestic water supply, providing      60% of the normal household hotwater load. In the summer,      the hot water is a byproduct of air conditioning and in      winter, hot water is made at one-third the cost of      operating an electric hot water tank.    </p>    <p>      While a geoexchange system will not relieve you completely      of dependence on grid power, it will dramatically reduce      the amount of electricity you need from your local utility      without sacrificing comfort. Indeed, this type of system      can provide heat up to 100°F and air conditioning down      to 45°F. In summer months, if the compressor in your      basement has to work only to reject heat to the cool earth      rather than the much hotter outdoor temperatures, it can      provide two to three times as many cooling BTUs per watt of      power consumed. That equals a savings of 50% to 66% in      cooling cost and a dramatically reduced electrical load for      the utility.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, since the Earth provides 75% of the heating and      cooling energy, analysts are discovering that noise and      thermal pollution from outdoor units is minimal. Electrical      generation, transmission loads and power plant emissions      can be reduced by 400% per household. All around,      geothermal energy is a win-win option for the environment,      utility companies and the homeowners.    </p>    <h3>      THE BIRTH OF GEOTHERMAL    </h3>    <p>      The idea for geothermal heating and cooling dates back to      the early 1940s when watercooled heat pumps and air      conditioners first evolved. Engineers and technicians      realized that water had a high rate of heat transfer that      allowed for smaller heat exchangers and minimal refrigerant      charges. From the 1940's to the 1970s, however, energy was      cheap, and not everyone had access to large volumes of      clean water or a place to discharge it. Consequently, most      of the early watercooled systems were used in commercial      structures where well water or process water was in      continually available. Meanwhile, the notably less      efficient air-source systems enjoyed a major market growth      due to their ease of installation.    </p>        <p>      These days, geothermal energy has become a major industry,      used in the creation of schools, hospitals, churches,      military bases, public housing and high-rise office towers.      Virtually every sector of the market with concern for      operating costs has come to recognize that energy expense      is significantly less with geothermal than with      conventional heating and cooling methods. In many      instances, public buildings are reaping return on the      initial investment in as little as four to five years.    </p>    <h3>      LOOP TO LOOP    </h3>    <p>      There are two primary types of geothermal systems:      open-loop and closed-loop. Open loop systems operate from      well water and require space for water discharge.      Closed-loop methods, however, circulate water and      antifreeze through a series of buried polyethylene pipes.      The closed loop varieties include pond loops, horizontal      trench loops and vertical loops.    </p>        <h3>      OPEN-LOOP SYSTEMS    </h3>    <p>      The open-loop variety requires a source of feed water, such      as a well. They are less expensive to install, but may cost      more to maintain if your water supply is unreliable. At      Geo-Source, a typical open-loop system ranges in cost from      $8,200 for the best 2.5-ton system to $11,400 for a      two-speed, 6-ton unit. That includes interior plumbing      materials, complete installation and a ten-year warranty.    </p>    <p>      While the majority of rural wells can be used with a      geothermal system, there are exceptions. One problem can be      the presence of iron bacteria in your water. Though not fit      for human consumption, they will cause a troublesome      buildup of iron deposits inside plumbing. If your water      source contains iron bacteria, you might want to consider a      closed-loop system.    </p>    <p>      If you're considering an open-loop system, make sure your      water supply or well can meet the following guidelines.      <em>(Note: More specific questions regarding the chemical      content of nonpotable water and its suitability for use are      best directed to an equipment manufacturer.)</em>    </p>    <p>      • Untreated water must be potable (no brackish or      rotten egg odors).<br />      • The water table should be within 100 feet of the      surface.<br />      • The volume of available water should be equal to      twice the peak household use.<br />      • Wells drilled into shallow bedrock and specifically      into karst (cavernous limestone) formations function best      if the casing can extend below the pumping water level.      (Shallow water is easily contaminated.)<br />      • Wells drilled into sand and gravel formations      function best if a well screen is installed. (Well screens      dramatically increase the capacity of a well and assure a      longer lasting and more reliable water supply.<br />      • Lastly, always avoid the use of galvanized pipe      fittings and steel pipe with any water system. Galvanized      steel is easily corroded by electrolysis and will fail      within a few years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Closed-loop systems are clean, very low-maintenance      and usually carry a loop materials warranty of 25 to 55      years.</strong>    </p>        <h3>      CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEMS    </h3>    <p>      The good thing about closed loop geoexchange systems is      that they can be installed almost anywhere. The loop is      filled once with clean water and nontoxic antifreeze, and a      small pump recirculates the antifreeze solution between the      loop and the exchange system. Closed loop systems remain      clean, are very low on maintenance and usually carry a loop      materials' warranty of 25 to 55 years. The three types of      closed-loop systems are pond, horizontal and vertical.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pond Loops</strong> For a six-ton geothermal system      a pond loop typically requires a pond size of at least half      an acre and a minimum depth of eight feet. Smaller ponds      may experience thermal fluctuations from the geoexchange      system, which can be stressful to aquatic life. In central      Ohio, we find our larger ponds typically run temperatures      of 70°F at eight feet in the summer, and 38°F in      the winter.    </p>        <p>      Pond loops are typically the lowest costing design of      closed loop heat exchanger. The average cost per ton of      capacity runs $500 to $600 for materials, antifreeze and      labor. A complete installation of equipment, a 10-year      warranty and a loop attached to existing ductwork costs      from $10,400 for a 2.5-ton unit to $15,300 for a two-speed,      six-ton size unit. To make trenching to a pond practical,      the pond should be at a lower elevation than the home and      no more than 300 feet away. Soil conditions should allow      for trenching without encountering bedrock or difficult      terrain.    </p>    <p>      Pond loops are typically constructed from 300-foot rolls of      0.75-inch polyethylene pipe that carry SDR11 rating. The      rolls are prepared with spacers between each layer of pipe      - once all spacers are in place and the rolls are banded      tightly, the spacers are attached to a manifold constructed      from one-inch SCH 40 polyethylene pipe. This manifold uses      a connection method called "reverse return", in which the      first circuit on the supply line is connected as the last      circuit on the return side. This requires more manifold      pipe but assures that each parallel circuit of pipe on the      manifold receives equal flow.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Horizontal Loops</strong> Horizontal loops      typically require two or more acres of unrestricted open      area for installation and the cost of a horizontal loop      will vary according to the loop design and the local site      conditions. Typical costs range from $600 to a little more      than $1,000 per ton of loop capacity. Complete systems with      ten-year warranties, installed with loops and attached to      existing duct work range in price from $11,700 for a      2.5-ton system to $18,500 for a six-ton, two-speed system.    </p>    <p>      The simplest horizontal loop is a single pipe loop      constructed from 1.25-inch polyethylene pipe. Single pipe      loops of up to 1,600 feet may be constructed and placed in      the bottom of a simple out and back trench dug to three to      five feet. Typically, the deeper the pipe is placed, the      more stable the soil temperature will be. The length of      pipe required for horizontal loops ranges from just under      750 feet per ton for light dry soil to as little as 350      feet per ton for heavy, saturated soil.<br />      <br />      More involved horizontal loops may assume any number of      configurations depending on lot and soil conditions. In      addition to the single-pipe trench, there are two-, three-,      four- and six-pipe trenches. As the number of pipes in a      trench increases, of course, so does the width, which      allows geoexchange contractors to lay extended-pipe loops      in what is known as "slinky" loops.    </p>    <p>      A typical slinky-loop field may consist of four or five      parallel trenches separated by ten to 15 feet and laid with      600 feet of coil. with an experienced crew of four -      track-hoe operator, safety-man and two loop installers -      the average work time to install a slinky loop is about an      hour and 20 minutes per ton of coil. After all costs are      accounted for, slinky loop installation averages $800 per      ton.    </p>        <h3>      Vertical Loops    </h3>    <p>      For small lots and locations with little acreage, vertical      loops are an economical alternative. They require the use      of a drilling rig to bore a four-inch diameter hole for the      heat exchanger piping. Depending on soil and rock      conditions, the depth of a vertical loop bore can range 130      to 245 feet per ton of equipment capacity. Drilling costs,      with manifold connections and antifreeze fill, average      $1,500 to $1,800 per ton. Local drilling costs vary, so      vertical loops can range from $12,600 for a 2.5-ton system      to as much as $21,870 for a six-ton, two-speed system with      a ten-year equipment warranty.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        Resources<br />        <strong>International Ground Source Heat Pump Association        (IGSPHA)</strong><br />        490 Cordell South Stillwater, OK 74078-8018 (800)        626-4747 http://www.igspha.okstate.edu<br />        <br />        <strong>WaterFurnace International</strong><br />        9000 Conservation Way Fort Wayne, IN 46809 (800) 934-5667        www.waterfurnace.com<br />        <br />        <strong>Office of Power Technologies U.S. Department of        Energy<br /></strong> (800) DEO-EREC (363-3732)        <strong><br /></strong>      </p>    </div>    <p>      When possible, vertical wells are separated by 15 feet to      avoid thermal interference between wells. The closed-loop      heat exchanger is constructed from two parallel lengths of      0.75-inch polyethylene pipe, and a "U" bend is welded to      the bottom end to connect the supply and return side of the      exchanger. Once the exchanger is assembled, it is      pressure-tested and a ten-foot section of re-bar is taped      to it to keep the lead section straight. Next, a grout line      is loosely attached and the exchanger is filled with water      to prevent it from floating back out of the well if the      well begins to fill with water. Once inserted into the      well, the bore is grouted up with a bentonite clay slurry      and the grout pipe is removed for reuse on the next well.      The bentonite grout serves two functions: to seal the well      and prevent contamination from surface sources, and to      provide a medium for heat transfer between the exchanger      tubing and the side wall of the well bore.    </p>    <p>      Related info:    </p>    <p>      Geothermal Checklist    </p>
