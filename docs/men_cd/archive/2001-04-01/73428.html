                            <p>      The ten-year program, led by University of Southern      California researchers, has been tracking the lung health      of about 3,000 middle school children from 12 communities      since 1993. Children are especially vulnerable to pollution      damage because their lungs are still developing, because      their airways are smaller and, ironically, because they      spend so much time playing and exercising outside.    </p>    <p>      The main irritant in the most polluted areas seems to be      the fine particles and acid vapors of nitrogen dioxide from      motor vehicle exhaust, industrial plant emissions and the      burning of fossil fuels. "Interestingly, the areas are all      currently meeting EPA standards, but those standards may      not be stringent enough," suggests Jim Gauderman, Ph.D,      lead author of the study.<br />    </p>    <p>      The long-term effects of pollution on lung capacity are      uncertain, but those children with lowered lung function      may grow up with weaker or smaller lungs; and may be more      vulnerable to respiratory diseases like pneumonia or      bronchitis in their 60s and 70s. People living in polluted      areas across the country should try to limit their exposure      to air pollution, and they should increase their intake of      antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, which protect      against oxidative lung damage.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Tanya Zimbardo</em>    </p>
