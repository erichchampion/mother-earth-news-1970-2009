                        <p>      Forget about building a better mousetrap - scientists at      the Department of Energy's Sandia Laboratories in New      Mexico are working with colleagues at Brown University to      develop a better light bulb - an ultraviolet,      vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser.    </p>    <p>      The technology is expected to save $100 billion a year in      energy costs worldwide, to reduce carbon emissions by about      350 million tons annually, and to take up less landfill      space. The lights are expected to last five to ten times      longer than fluores cents.    </p>    <p>      Less energy demand, of course, benefits the environment. As      Sandia spokesman Neal Singer explains, "A lot of our      arguments about power plants would be academic - you just      wouldn't build as many of them." The lights may also      inspire aesthetic creativity - the postage stamp-size chips      can be arranged almost anywhere near an electric outlet in      any conceivable pattern.    </p>    <p>      But before they get carried away with design, the      scientists at Sandia need to find a way to electrically      power the lasers - a crucial step that is one to two years      away. Right now, this technology is only a prototype, as      Singer says, "It's a toddler - hardly crawling yet - we      need to make it grow up."    </p>    <p>      <em>-Kristina Mastrocola<br /></em>    </p>
