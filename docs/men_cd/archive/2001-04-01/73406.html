                    <p>      Sometimes you need a way to clamp thick books or magazines      open to review recipes or other material while reading or      copying. Pianists and other musicians may find clamps      useful for holding flimsy song sheets in place on a music      rack, and dozens of other household chores, such as gluing,      sewing and carpentry work, call for light clamping. At a      garage sale recently, I found an ideal solution.    </p>    <p>      Large wooden clamps made of scrap wood, ideally of      3/4-inch-thick pine shelving, can be easily constructed in      just a few minutes' time with a scroll or saber saw. These      clamps have wide jaws that are closed with rubber bands so      you can control the strength of the clamp by adding or      subtracting rubber bands. The soft jaws of the clamp will      provide a tight grip. A thin strip of rubber may be      cemented in the jaws to keep them from scratching finely      finished surfaces.    </p>    <p>      ARTHUR R. LEE<br />      Santa Cruz, California    </p>
