                <h1 id="subtitle">      Alpacapalooza    </h1>            <p>      "We wanted to raise livestock that we didn't have to do in      to get their product," said Bill Henry of Burlington,      Washington. He and his wife, Susan, have four and a half      acres of land that easily accommodate their herd of 20      alpacas. "They're very easy to raise and very inexpensive      to raise," says Henry, and "they seem to do well basically      anywhere."    </p>    <p>      If you would like to know more about these fleecy critters      and expect to be near Monroe, Washington in early April,      check out Alpacapalooza, April 7-8 at the Evergreen State      Fairgrounds, for two days of peace, love and livestock.
