    <p>
                            <p>      Installation of a geoexchange system is not so much      difficult as it is time-consuming. The installer needs to      have an excellent background in ducting, high-voltage      (240-volt) and low-voltage (24-volt) controls wiring,      plumbing, loop purge and fill procedures, and a working      knowledge of refrigeration systems. The majority of heating      and air conditioning contractors do not have technicians      with the background necessary to handle a geoexchange in      stallation like an experienced and certified GSC.      Conventional heating contractors tend to focus on      relatively simple, one-day furnace and air-conditioning      installations. By contrast, a closed-loop geoexchange      installation can take a crew of three workers up to five      working days to complete a project, with roughly 60% of the      time dedicated to installing piping and filling the loop.    </p>    <p>      If you decide to move ahead on your own, you should still      use a local GSC as a source of information and possibly as      a service partner to look after the system while you're      installing it. The services Geo-Source One provides for      those who wish to take a direct role in a system      installation include establishing a contract as a      consultant in the project, performing an energy analysis      for the home, sizing equipment, designing ductwork and      closed loop, and providing for delivery of equipment      materials and any specialty tools needed for installation.      As construction progresses I arrange for site inspections      and assistance where the tasks may exceed the time or      ability of the owner. I find this method of managing a DIY      project adds con s istency to the installation and helps to      avoid many of the potential pitfalls that can beset a      "first-time" installation.    </p>    <h3>      DUCTING    </h3>    <p>      In addition to the trenching and pipe laying work outlined      in the main article , you'll need to adapt your ductwork to      fit a geoexchange system.    </p>    <p>      On main floors, the supply air registers are located six      inches from outside walls and positioned beneath windows or      adjacent to outside doors. The return air intakes for the      first- and any upper-level floors are all situated "high      side wall" (HSW). The return air in a finished basement is      located "low side wall" (LSW). I've found this means of      collecting return air produces the most uniform temperature      within the structure, with little more than a few degrees      difference between basement- and upper-level temperature.      By comparison, older duct designs that use low side wall or      floor level returns have inherently warm ceilings, cold      drafty floors and a basement area that is cold and      uncomfortable year round. Constantly operating a fan in      these situations helps a little, but serves more to create      cold drafts since the bulk of the circulation is from the      cold floors.    </p>    <p>      Every contractor has a preference for ducting material, and      for trunk lines the favorite is usually sheet metal. My      preference, however, is a ridged, foil-faced fiberglass      product called duct board. Available from a number of      sources, duct board is shipped in cartons of 4x10 sheets.      The sections can be shipped flat and assembled on-site.      When properly installed, the high-density duct board      maintains a system with no air leakage. Also, the people in      whose homes we run duct board trunk lines do not notice the      "white noise," or random popping and booming caused by the      expansion and contraction of metal trunk lines. The use of      flexible canvas collars at connections to the system will      also help reduce any harmonics between motors and sheet      metal. However, air turbulence within the sheet metal will      still produce some noise at the registers.    </p>    <h3>      SAFETY FIRST    </h3>    <p>      With the proper advice and guidelines, laying your home's      geothermal piping can be challenging (but moneysaving)      work. Here are a few pointers to help you dig safely:    </p>    <p>      -Before you dig, contact the local utility location      service. Allow plenty of time for their agents to mark out      the site and locate any underground utilities.    </p>    <p>      -Mark utility easements, septic tanks, tile fields, water      well casings and underground piping that needs to be      avoided.    </p>    <p>      -Figure out where excavated soil will be stored as an area      is cleared and keep it away from the edges of any trench to      prevent cave-ins. Trench spoils should sit at least three      feet back from any five-foot trench wide enough to hold a      person. In a trench that big, even a small cave-in can      involve more than 1,500 pounds-a weight you do not want      plummeting in on top of you. Complete all work in a trench      as quickly as possible and get out. Also, it's a good idea      to work out an alternative means of escape from any      excavation. A ladder works well, but I often carry a shovel      and place it across the top sides of the trench. This way,      a quick jump and pull-up can make for a quick escape.    </p>
