             		<p><strong>MOTHER'S PHOTO CLUB</strong></p>				<p><em>More      snapshots from Mother Country</em>    </p>    <p>      Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote a poem in 1865 entitled      Atalanta in Calydon,      which includes one of our favorite tributes to the season      of rebirth:    </p>		<p><em>When the hounds</em> <em>of spring are on winter's    traces,</em><br /> <em>The mother of months in meadow or plain<br /></em> <em>Fills    the shadows and windy places,<br />    With lisp of leaves and ripple of rain,</em><br /> <em>For    winter's rains and ruins are over,</em>		</p>    <p>      And all the season of snows and sins,<br />      The days dividing lover and lover,<br />      The light that loses, the night that wins;<br />      And time remembered is grief forgotten,<br />      And frosts are slain and flowers begotten,<br />      And in green underwood and cover,<br />      Blossom by blossom the spring begins.    </p>        <p>      <strong>"Emmy with 7-inch purple teepee bean," by R. Ogle      of Silver, Virginia.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Patricia Fain Hutson of Newport, Virginia, shows us      that spring conquers all.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>"Tomatoes" by Leila Koeppel of Lake Mills,      Wisconsin.<br /></strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>In the company of such great photographs, it's not      really fair to pick favorites, but the minute we saw this      one, faces lit up all over the place. LaDonna Powell of      Elkins, Arkansas, writes: "Enclosed is a photo of my      stepdaughter. She is with her step great-grandad. He is      sorting potatoes according to their sizes and Natalie just      couldn't</strong> <strong><em>seem to</em> understand why      anyone would do that."</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Jodi Higgins of Fort Collins, Colorado snapped 18-month-old      fledgling gardener Bridget Higgins inaction. "We've just      moved to Colorado, " she writes, `and we're slowly learning      and experimenting with our new climate. "Bridget seems      right at home.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>A burst of color from Nancy J. Rapalee of Dundee, New      York.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Tina Beeler of Lutterll, Tennessee, took this photo      of her daughter; Britney. Two roses, side by      side.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Madonna Dunbar of Kings Beach, California      writes:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>"I live full-time in a bus-conversion (a classic      4515 GMC coach) and so most of my gardening is limited to      container plants and bonsai trees. Last year, however, I      had the opportunity to garden a small plot in New Mexico      ...and boy did I enjoy it! The photo shows my birdseed      site; migrating songbirds on their way south had picked it      dean by October."</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>We received this gem from Paul Lamb just before we      went to press with this issue. Who could      resist?</strong></p>  <p>			<em><strong>Americans bought more than 1.2 billion      fresh-cut roses last year. That's nearly a dozen for every      woman in the nation. We get nearly 60% of our fresh-cut      flowers from California.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      We hope that these images of spring help you shake off the      cold a bit faster.
