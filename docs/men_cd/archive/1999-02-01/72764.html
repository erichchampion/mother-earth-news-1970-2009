            		 <p><strong>BITS &      PIECES</strong></p>						<h5 id="byline"><em>By Jasmine Fox</em>    </h5>        <p>      Before the city of Hammond, Indiana, started a clever new      strategy for recycling the 400 trees it removed for      residents each year, the downed wood was hauled to city      landfills and left to rot. But when Lake County Solid Waste      Management District Executive Director Jeff Langbehn      visited the local Hoosier Sawmill in early 1997, he got to      talking with mill operators about a win-win deal for      everyone.</p><p> Now Hammond, located 33 miles southeast of      Chicago, Illinois, has found a way to use these fallen      trees--becoming a working template for cities across the      nation that are letting valuable resources go to waste.</p><p> The      old system cost the city in many ways: loss of landfill      space, loss of valuable wood, loss of clean air due to      methane gas produced by tree decay, and more than $100,000      a year in hauling and dumping fees.</p><p> With the new plan,      dubbed "Trees to Furniture," the city takes the trees to      Hoosier Sawmill to be milled into usable lumber, rather      than hauling them to a landfill. The sawmill keeps 70% of      the wood for compensation, and the other 30% is transformed      into city picnic tables, park benches, garden sheds, and      more.</p><p> This delights city officials, who used to spend more      than S3.000 on picnic tables alone every year.</p><p> "This      project has taken on a life of its own," says Langbehn.      "Everyone I've talked to is really pumped about it. We're      taking natural resources that were being thrown away and      allowed to decay and turning them into useful products."</p><p>      Langbehn cites many benefits. Hammond saves thousands of      dollars on the dumping of trees, as well as on the building      of park fixtures. Less tree decay means less air-polluting      methane gas. And Hoosier Sawmill gets a ready source of      material at no cost, which it then sells to a local palate      company, thereby helping to preserve local jobs.</p><p> When      portable sawmill manufacturer Wood-Mizer Inc. got a glimpse      of Hammond's progressive new plan, they thought it had      great potential for the city of Indianapolis. At 1,500,000      people (to Hammond's population of 85,000) the greater      metropolitan area of Indianapolis will take a little more      organization than the Hammond venture. From public land      alone, the city takes down over 3,000 trees a year, most of      which end up as firewood or landfill fodder. Still,      coordinators hope to have "Trees to Furniture" running in      Indianapolis before the end of the summer.</p><p> The biggest goal      of the Indianapolis project is utilizing different species      of wood at the highest practical rates, according to Greg      Fennig, executive director of program coordinators for Keep      Indianapolis Beautiful (K.I.B.). So, for instance, less      marketable species of trees like mulberry and peach might      still be cut into firewood, but more valuable hardwoods      like cherry, walnut, and oak would be milled for usable      lumber. "I like firewood," says Fennig. "But people should      realize that if it's a good quality wood, there are many      other uses."</p><p> Various uses for the new wood supply were      imagined at a recent meeting of key project players, hosted      by Wood-Mizer, Inc. Besides utilizing it for city      construction of park benches, picnic tables, and sawdust to      replace salt on city streets, valuable hardwood could be      sold to more than 500 furniture makers in the state,      donated to vocational schools, to the Boy Scouts for      various building projects, or to Habitat for Humanity, a      nonprofit low-income housing organization.</p><p> Fennig and other      K.I.B. organizers believe the program is just innovative      enough that they may be able to persuade their      well-respected parent organization, Keep America Beautiful,      to act as a catalyst in spreading it to cities across the      nation.</p><p> Says Fennig, "We anticipate that it'll go over      really well. It really strengthens the relationship between      local governments and private sector folks."    </p>
