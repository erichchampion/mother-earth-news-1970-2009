            		<p>	 			<strong>SEASONS OF EARTH      AND SKY</strong></p>			<p>	     <strong>How to watch the winter patterns of the moon 8      planets</strong> .</p>		<h5 id="byline">			 <em>By Fred Schaaf</em>    </h5>        <p>      <strong>The crescent moon from top to bottom: Feb. 21, Feb.      20, Feb. 19, Feb. 18, Feb. 17. The planets at dusk, Feb.      23,after sunset: Saturn top center, then      Venus,Jupiter and Mercury. On Feb. 18, Venus and Jupiter      will be farther apart but lie not far to the lower right of      the moon, with Jupiter</strong><strong>higher than Venus.</strong></p><p>      This February won't provide us with a      full moon, though the sky will compensate us in March with      the rare (and long-fabled) "blue moon."</p><p> The time between      one full moon and the next averages (with very slight      variation) about 29-1/2 days. So there can never be two      truly full moons in February not even in leap year, when      February is still a half day too short. our longer months,      on the other hand, can have two full moon s in fact, this      happens once every few years. When it does, the second full      moon of the month is called a "blue moon." However, I      suspect that this definition of a blue moon came into being      in recent years or decades. The very much older phrase      "once in a blue moon" probably originated with an event      much more rare than a two full-moon month: initially, it      probably referred to those rare instances when the moon      literally looks blue.</p><p> What causes the moon and sometimes      the sun to look blue (or green or bronze) is a pall      containing particles of just the right size to      preferentially scatter the blue wavelength of moonlight or      sunlight. Such a cloud may be produced by widespread forest      fres or by vast volcanic eruptions. The only really      widespread and striking case of blue moon (and sun) in the      U.S. during this century was the one in September 1950,      which was visible across New York, New England, and part of      the Mid-Atlantic states. It was caused by Canadian forest      fires.</p><p> If you want rare, however, the pattern of a      two-full-moons-January, no-full-moon February, and      two-full-moons March is pretty rare. Instances of it can      never occur less than 19 years apart, but it doesn't always      occur that often. This year's instance is only the fourth      of the 20th century, and the last time it happened was in      1961. It won't happen again until 19 years from now, in      2018.</p><p> Actually, I do need to qualify the above statements.      They are the correct years if you figure the exact times of      full moons in the astronomers' worldwide time system,      universal or Greenwich time. This year's episode of two      fulls, no full, two fulls happens in both universal time      and in American time zones. But that is not always true.      Nevertheless, whatever time zone you calculate these events      for, they average about one per generation.		</p>		<h3>	      Thrilling Months for the Planets			</h3> 		<p>		  The two full moons of March will look more or less like any other      full moons. But in the west, at dusk, during this February      and March, there are sights not just of great intellectual      interest but also of great visual beauty. There is one of      the finest arrangements of moon and planets in years and      what is arguably the closest really visible conjunction      (meeting) of the two brightest planets in decades.</p><p> February      begins with the two most brilliant planets, Venus and      Jupiter, still about 22° apart. When we talk about      degrees in the sky, we mean fractions of the 180° of      the half circle or dome that we perceive the sky to be.      Thus, from horizon to overhead-halfway across the sky-is      half of 180°, which is 90°. You can measure these      "angular distances" in the sky by using your hand: your      fist held out at full arm's length is, from your viewpoint,      about 10° wide.</p><p> Venus and Jupiter may start the month      over 20° (two fist widths at arm's length) apart, but      the gap between them closes rapidly. Each night, they are      about a degree closer together, the brighter and lower of      the two, Venus, appearing notably higher and Jupiter      notably lower. Thus, at nightfall on February 17, they are      only 6° apart when a lovely crescent moon shows up      about 5.2° below Venus. The night after this line of      Jupiter-Venus moon, we see the moon leap up to the upper      left of Jupiter: the three great lights now form a      triangle, with Venus and Jupiter 5° apart, Jupiter and      the moon 4° apart, and the moon and Venus about 8f°      apart. The additions of Saturn far to the upper left and      Mercury to the lower right make this scene even lovelier.</p><p>      Each night thereafter, the moon moves higher and farther      left (east). But Jupiter and Venus keep getting closer      together. Each night, they are beautiful, but if your sky      is clear on February 23, you will see the two 0.15°      apart-almost close enough for their rays to be touching.</p><p> In      the final days of February and first of March, Venus keeps      getting higher, Jupiter lower, and Jupiter pulls fairly      near a new planet below and to the right of it, Mercury.      (Check the almanac, page 78, for details about some      particular nights). On March 8, four of the five bright      planets are within 27f° of each other in the west at      dusk (though Mercury has just about faded from view). In      the next two weeks, Venus nears Saturn and has a fairly      lovely conjunction with it. But there are two more planets      you should hear about for February and March.</p><p> One planet is      Mars. It rises in the late evening in February, a little      earlier in March. Mars will be unmistakable because it will      be brightening each week and its color (golden-orange)      becomes increasingly noticeable.</p><p> There is one more planet      to mention the dimmest of them all. That planet is Pluto,      and for the past 20 years, schoolchildren have had to learn      that formerly farthest Pluto was actually now slightly      closer to the sun than Neptune. Well, this 20-year period      ends on February 10, 1999. Pluto will once again be farther      from the sun than Neptune or any other now-known planet of      our solar system ...for about the next 230 years!		</p>	<h3>		      Centennial of Cold			</h3> 		<p>				Maybe no American cold wave has been more shiver-inducing than the one that      occurred 100 years ago this February. When it entered the      lower 48 on February 11, it dropped temperatures to as low      as - 61°F in Montana. By the next morning, the Arctic      blast had rushed over the eastern plains and Texas,      bringing a low of -22°F to Kansas City and -8°F to      El Paso!</p><p> Twelve different states recorded their lowest      temperatures ever for any date in this cold wave (some of      the records set still stand). The third morning, February      13, brought the coldest weather ever recorded along the      Gulf Coast and parts of Florida: 6.8°F at New Orleans,      -1°F at Mobile, 7°F at Pensacola, and the all-time      Florida low of -2°F at Tallahassee. On the morning of      February 12, 1899, Washington, D.C., saw a low of      -15°F. But the great problem for the East was the      blizzard that was about to hit in the wake of the cold      wave. The "Great Eastern Blizzard of '99" dumped 34 inches      of snow on Washington, D.C.--20.5 inches of those on      Valentine's Day. It also left buried beneath 41 inches of      snow the Victorian town of Cape in May, located at the      southern-most tip of New Jersey-setting a snow-depth record      that remains an all-time high for the Garden State.</p><p> Today      we are familiar with the undulatory nature of the jet      stream's position and how its dips are typically just wide      enough to bring extremely frigid winter weather to most of      the U.S., while the rest of the country basks in unusual      warmth. The existence of the jet stream was not even      suspected back in 1899. Today, we can nod knowingly when we      hear that on February 18, 1899, the mercury in San      Francisco soared to 80°F.</p><p> You know a cold wave is      powerful when its icy touch reaches the southernmost United      States. Perhaps even more astonishing is when snow falls      and gathers in these parts of the country. Note especially      the storm that America's greatest weather historian, the      late David M. Ludlum, called "probably the greatest      deep-snow anomaly in the recorded climate history of the      United States." It occurred on February 14 and 15, 1895,      and dropped amounts the likes of which have yet to be seen      again in our southeastern states. Places in southwestern      Louisiana got up to 24 inches of snow; Galveston had 15      inches, New Orleans, eight. It even snowed at the very      mouth of the Mississippi River.		</p>		<h3>				 The King of Storms			 </h3> 		<p>	 			Jupiter's most recognizable characteristic      is its "Great Red Spot," a massive (twice the diameter of      the earth) anticyclonic storm system that has persisted in      the atmosphere for over 100 years. Winds at the outer edges      of the storm reach 250 mph, while the center is very nearly      calm. The storm is massive enough to spawn temporary white      oval storms, which are 2000 miles or more in diameter and      rage for approximately 40 years. Despite close passes by      the <em>Voyager</em> and <em>Galileo</em> spacecraft,      scientists have no idea how the storm formed or why it      refuses to resolve itself.		</p>			<h3>			 What About the Wind Chill?			 </h3> 			<p> 			 The lowest temperature ever recorded was      -128.6°F on July 21,1983, in Vostok, Antarctica. The      lowest average annual temperature is in Plateau Station,      Antarctica ...a balmy-70°F .    </p>
