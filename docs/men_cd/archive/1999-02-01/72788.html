                      <p>      <strong><em>Get started in community      supported agriculture.</em></strong>     </p>      <h5 id="byline">        by Sarah Milstein      </h5>            <p>      In 1992, Debby and Pete Kavakos began growing produce on an      acre of their homestead property, Stoneledge Farm, in      upstate New York. They sold their vegetables at a local      farmers' market and to restaurants. Although they knew they      wanted to expand their business, they realized after a few      seasons that local markets would not be big enough to      support their growth.</p><p> They thought of selling at farmers'      markets in New York City, about three hours away. "My      family has been farming for generations, and my      great-grandfather sold his goods in New York City," says      Debby, "so that's a natural connection for us." But with a      distant farmers' market, Debby would have to spend a couple      of full days in the city each week--leaving in the morning      before her four children woke up and returning at night      after they were asleep.    </p>        <p>      In 1996, the Kavakos      learned about community supported agriculture (CSA, through      an organic agriculture newsletter. In CSA, members buy      shares of farm's harvest before the season begins; Then,      usually June through late fall. CSA members receive a share      of the farm's bounty. CSA growers may make weekly      deliveries to distribution points. or members may pick up      at the farm. Typically, seven to ten types of fresh.      usually organic vegetables are delivered or picked up each      week.</p><p> The Kavakos thought that a city-based CSA group might      meet their needs "A big part 6i the reason we enjoy farming      is the family aspect of it, and the CSA group allows us to      tap the city market, but with a much shorter trip. It takes      between six and eight hours total to drive down, unload the      truck, visit with members and maybe do a little city      shopping, then drive back," Debby explains. "It works into      our family and our marketing goals."    </p>    			<p> To start their group, Debby contacted just      Food, a New York City nonprofit organization that works on      food-related issues. Just Food helped her find a few      interested city people who could work with her to bulld a      membership and to find a distribution site. The Kavakos now      grow 140 shares on 15 acres. and would like to expand to      300 shares over the next three or four years. Two CSA      groups comprise more than 90% of the couple's business,      with their remaining shares going to a few local people.      With the promise of growth, Stoneledge has been able to      invest in a 40' x 60' pole barn and some new equipment,      including a tractor and delivery truck. Debby now farms      full time, with help from the Kavakos kids; they hope that      next year, Pete will be able to quit his off-farm job and      work with the family full time, as well.</p><p> The CSA group is      not a perfect solution for the Kavakos. "We might be able      to make more per acre if we sold at a farmers' market,"      Debby says. "And there's lots of stress because people have      already paid and have expectations of our deliveries. Plus,      managing the CSA group is not always easy. It took a while      to build trust and respect between the growers and the      members. At first, we were worried: Are the members going      to tell us how to run our farm? We're still working out      some of those communications and a sense of which jobs the      members do and which things we do. It's a continual      learning process."    </p>        <p>      <strong><em>Debby and Peter Kavakos tending their      Stoneledge Farm in upstate New York. Right is Debby,      proudly mugging in front of their new truck. Business must      be good!</em></strong>    </p>        <p>     The idea of CSA developed about 30 years ago in Japan, where it is called      <em>teikei,</em> which translates as "food with the      farmer's face on it." <em>Teikei</em> moved first to Europe      and then, in 1985, it was introduced to the U.S., where the      term community supported agriculture was coined.</p><p> Today,      Stoneledge Farm is one of about 600 CSA groups in North      America that together provide produce to nearly 100,000      people.</p>			<h3>The CSA MODEL</h3> 			<p>For growers, the many benefits of CSA include receiving cash up front during      the winter months, when it is most needed but least      forthcoming. And, with the season long support of a      community, you are guaranteed a market for your produce and      are thus relieved of some of the risk of small-scale      farming.    </p>         	<p>The community supported agriculture model is very flexible, and 			every CSA group is unique. In some groups, members pay ahead of time for a      full season, with the understanding that they will accept      some of the risks of production (if you have a tomato      failure, they'll buy their tomatoes elsewhere) and may      enjoy some of the bounty (if you have a terrific basil crop      they'll freeze pesto by the quirt). In other groups,      members subscribe on a monthly basis and receive a      predetermined amount of produce each week. Most CSA groups      offer vegetables as their basic share. But some groups also      offer fruit, herbs, flowers, bread, cheese, eggs, yogurt,      beef, honey, maple syrup, and most anything else you can      produce on a farm.			</p>			<p>      <strong>WHAT YOU</strong> <strong>NEED TO START A CSA      GROUP</strong></p><p> <strong>Growing Experience</strong></p><p> First of      all, you must be an accomplished grower. CSA is not for      beginners! It requires experience growing 40 or more crops      in a succession that will yield seven or more different      items on the same day each week over the course of a 20- to      52-week season. While farming any piece of land is a long      term learning process and members who support a farmer      assume some risk, you cannot expect them to finance your      complete on-the-job training.</p><p> "It's harder to be a CSA      grower than a regular market gardener," observes Debby      Kavakos, "because you have to have many goodies each      week.with a farmers' market, you leave your failures at      home and bring what you have. But with the CSA shares, you      can't just have a bagful of cabbage and that's it. People      expect a variety of good things".</p><p> One of the most      frequently cited factors in failed CSA groups is that the      grower did not know how to grow a diverse, bountiful      harvest. Several seasons of selling directly to people at      farmers' markets or through a farm stand can help you learn      what items customers like and how to produce them.			</p>      <h3>Members</h3>	<p>			Members are what constitutes a CSA      group, but how many members do you neeicirSW:K Hollow Farm      in Argyle, New York has about a dozen local members in its      CSA group, who pick up their shares in the barn's washing      area. The CSA members cover a small percentage of the      farm's operating budget, with most of Slack Hollow's seven      acres of vegetables sold through a food co-op in the      region. Across the Hudson River, Roxbury Farm in Claverack      grows 25 acres of vegetables for nearly 700 members. The      Roxbury members account for 90% o7 the farm's operating      budget and live in three different areas in two cities and      in the farm's own county.    </p>    			<p>Slack Hollow and Roxbury exemplify the      range of sizes for CSA groups and the variety of roles CSA      can play in a farm or a market garden. A 1996 survey of CSA      farms in the Northeast found that the average membership      was 65 households: three quarters of the 100 growers      responding to the survey used other market outlets( such as      farmer's markets and wholesaling) in addition to the CSA      group.</p><p> The number of members you'll need will depend on      many factors, including your acreage, your expected output,      and you budget if you are planning on delivering off-site,      you will probably need a minimum of 50 members to make your      run worthwhile.      </p>      <h3>Marketing Strategy</h3>			<p>			Once you've decided how      many members you're aiming for, how do you find folks to      sign on? A primary tool for advertising your CSA group will      be brochures. So create--or have a member create--a trifold      brochure that explains CSA, gives some details about your      farm, and has a tear-off enrollment form. All printed      materials about your CSA group should include full contact      information and a mention of your growing methods if you      follow organic guidelines.    </p>        <p>A simple one-page flyer appropriate for posting on community      bulletin boards will also be useful; hang them liberally.      You may also run a small, simple newspaper ad. Many local      papers will print it free of charge if they have extra      space.</p><p> Unlike advertising, publicity is media coverage that      you don't pay for. Let local media outlets such as      newspapers, radio, cable television, and Web sites know      that you're starting an exciting venture. Send them--or      have a member write and send out--a press release      announcing the availability of shares and include with it      your brochure, farm newsletter (1f you have one); and clips      from other coverage you have received (if any). Many farms      find it fruitful to start out by holding one or two      informational meetings at the farm, or to give a couple of      off-farm presentation (ideally with a slide show of your      operation and your family in; libraries, schools, churches,      synagogues, or other community centers in the town your      targeting for members. Media outlets will find the meetings      interesting, so let the know when you're holding them.</p><p>      Word-of-mouth is the most success fun form of marketing for      CSA group. It tends to catch over time, but how can you      maximize personal advertising right now?</p><p> • Ask each      current member to tell three friends about your CSA group.      Give them brochures so they can pass them along and ask      them to post flyers at ten different places.</p><p> •      Encourage vacationing members to have friends pick up their      sharers when they are out of town.</p><p> • Create a rotating      gift share and print up a gift certificate. .Each week,      give the certificate to a different member and ask them to      give it to a friend who can then use it to pick up a share      and learn about the CSA group firsthand.</p><p> • Try an      incentive plan in which you give $10 per share referral      bonus to both the referrer and the referred.			</p>      <h3>A Core Group    </h3>                <p> Generally speaking, a core group is a      committee of four to ten committed CSA members who      volunteer is take responsibility for CSA functions that      happen beyond the garden gates - responsibilities include      recruiting members, finding a distribution site, overseeing      the distribution site, keeping treasury and membership      records, coordinating member work shifts at the      distribution site running community events such as potlucks      and farm festivals, educating members about local      agriculture and cooking with fresh produce, and maintaining      food pantry connections. A core group can also work with      the grower to figure out an annual budget for the farm and      set the share price.</p><p> By taking on some or all of these CSA      functions, a core group enables you to concentrate on      growing. And, by getting involved in the farm and working      closely with the farmers, core group member develop a      special commitment to your CSA and carry their enthusiasm      to the larger community.</p><p> Core groups are particularly      useful if you have a fairly distant off-farm delivery      location and don't know potential members or distribution      sites. Says Debby Kavakos, "We were wary of entrusting some      critical jobs to people we barely knew 200 miles away. But      we couldn't have started our New York City CSA membership      without a core group, and now some of those people have      become good friends." Not all CSA farms have core groups,      however, either because the growers prefer to handle the      aforementioned duties themselves, or because there are not      enough members interested in serving on a core group.</p><p> If      you want a core group to become part of your CSA operation,      look for people to perform specific tasks such as managing      the distribution site for the duration of a season. Let      them know what type of work is involved (lots of greeting      people), how much time it will take (four hours per week),      when it needs to be done (Tuesdays, between 3:00 P.m. and      7:00 P.m.), and what, if anything, they will receive in      return (lots of gratitude and satisfaction). Sometimes,      farmers provide a share or partial share in exchange for      the work a core group member does.			</p>			<h3>Communication with Your Members</h3>		<p>			Perhaps the single most important thing you can provide for your members besides      delicious produce is a weekly letter from the farm. This      may sound like a lot of work, but it need not take more      than ten or 15 minutes per week, and it's crucial for      building members' understanding of your project and loyalty      to it.</p><p> "Last year was a fairly hard year on our farm," says      Sarah Shapiro, field manager at Quail Hill Community Farm      (a project of the Peconic Land Trust) on the eastern tip of      Long Island. "We had maybe five newsletters from the farm      all year. This year, a member edited a weekly sheet that      included news from the field, information about farm events      and a column from a different farm staff person each week.      It's great fun, it's made a tremendous difference, and has      really helped with communication and increased member      satisfaction."</p><p> For the most part, your members will know      very little about just how difficult and exciting it is to      grow food on a commercial scale. A photocopied one-page or      even half-page handwritten note discussing one aspect of      the farm experience that week, the weather and its effect      on the crops, an unusual vegetable in the share, the      weather, a recently-hired worker, the weather, a new piece      of equipment, the weather, a plague of flea beetles, the      weather, a sauerkraut-making experiment, and ...the weather      will deeply increase members' connection with you and their      willingness to support the farm through adversity.</p><p>      Computer-generated farm letters are fine, especially if      your handwriting is messy. But don't feel compelled to do      anything fancy; some people prefer a low-tech letter that      lets them get to know you through your script. If possible,      rotate authorship of the letter around your crew and      occasionally ask a member to write it from his or her      perspective. Members always appreciate a recipe or two      photocopied onto the other side of the farm letter, giving      them ideas for using some of the vegetables in that week's      share (be sure to credit any cookbooks that serve as      sources).    </p>    <h3>      Distribution Site and Managers    </h3>	<p>			If you're delivering shares off-farm, you'll need a    reliable site. Members in the delivery community should be    able to help find a site and sometimes will offer a garage,    porch, or yard. If that is not feasible, churches and    community centers are often receptive to housing a weekly    distribution. Look for a good-sized room, garage, courtyard,    or other area that is accessible to a truck, can get a little    muddy, and can be used for about five hours each week. Indoor    or covered space u nice but not necessary, as vegetables    don't mind getting wet.</p><p> If your distribution is on-farm, you    may ,wish to designate an area of the barn or of another    outbuilding that is safe for children and won't create a    nuisance for you.		</p>    			<p>Some growers      deliver their produce in already bagged or boxed shares.      Prepackaging is a lot of work for you, :cough, and so      unless you've got a particular reason for doing it, setting      produce out in bulk may be easier. Also, many members like      digging their hands into the crates--it echoes in a small      way your experience of the harvest. The bulk distribution      (ask members to bring their own bags) also allows members      some :election and it tends to lead to a good deal of      socializing at the site, a priority for some groups. A bulk      distribution usually involves a chalkboard with a list      written out every week, telling members how much of each      vegetable to take. With a bulk distribution, you will      almost certainly need a site manager.</p><p> Most likely, whether      the distribution is on your land or not, you'll have time      to drop off the goods, but won't be able to stick around      for three or four hours to make sure every family gets its      share. A site manager is a non-farmer who fills this role.      Further, many CSA groups require that members put in a few      hours every year in helping at the site.</p><p> Sam and Elizabeth      Smith of Caretaker Farm in Williamstown, Massachusetts, ask      their 185 members to volunteer for a few hours over the      course of each season at their barn-based distribution.      "The distribution is pretty straightforward, but there's      always something new each week and it's good to have a      person overseeing things," explains Sam.			</p>			<h3>Surplus Distribution    </h3>        <p>At the end of each distribution, you      will have leftover vegetables (from people who did not pick      up all or part of their share). The bigger your membership,      the more surplus you will have, but count on at least 10%      leftover every week. Many farms donate this surplus to a      food pantry or soup kitchen that is near the distribution      site, and some give the extras directly to needy families      that they know.</p><p> Some growers plan on delivering overage      specifically to people with little or no income, who may      not be able to afford the fresh, high-quality produce that      everyone needs. The Food Bank Farm in Hadley,      Massachusetts, grows about half of its produce for the      needy.</p><p> If you are working with a church group or other      community center, you may be able to barter your surplus      for use of its site.			</p>			<h3>A Pricing System</h3>		<p>      There are as many ways of deriving a share price as there      are CSA groups. One method is to determine your overall      growing costs, then divide that by the number of shares      you're going to grow (or, if your operation has several      market outlets, decide on the percentage of your budget the      CSA will cover and divide that by the number of shares).      Another way is to estimate a dollar amount you are going to      deliver each week, based on your farm stand or farmers'      market prices.    </p>        <p>      How do you explain your share price to      members? While you need not provide a detailed accounting      of your expenses, members stand to learn a good deal about      the costs of growing, selling, and distributing food, and      the better educated your members are, the more likely they      will be to understand and support the farm during times of      difficulty or growth. A simple pie chart (or a list of      percentages) that gives a rough idea of how much of your      budget is spent on each of several broad categories (like      labor, land, inputs, capital expenses. trucking and      administration), and a note of how much of the farm's      budget is covered by the CSA and by other sources. ought to      suffice.</p><p> What if you have customers who do not have the      resources to pay for food months before it is delivered, or      even to pay for food at all? Many farms allow a few members      to work off some or all of a share, either through farm      labor or through administrative and distribution site work.      You can also accept payments on a long-term installation      plan, and you can offer a sliding-scale share fee. If      members or organizations donate a share, you can offer a      sort of scholarship. There is always a way to be      compensated.</p><p> The most frequent comment experienced CSA      growers make is, "Start small and grow slowly." They also      put a lot of emphasis on planning ahead. Since you'll place      your seed orders over the winter, January is not too early      to begin recruiting members and testing interest in your      target community.</p><p> Finally, whether you do it for profit or      for other personal rexasons, CSA should be fun and      fulfilling. It's not for everyone, but the model can be      adapted to your specific needs. Let creativity guide you as      you develop a group; you may be surprised by the results.      Notes Debby Kavakos, "Four or five members are coming up      from the city tomorrow to plant garlic with us. It's      amazing to me that people are going to take the time and      expense to help out because they care about next year. That      level of commitment has been very reassuring for us. It      makes us step back sometimes and appreciate our farm and      what we do."</p><p> <em>Call</em> <em>MOTHER'S Bookshelf at      1-800-888-9098 to order your copy of The Earth-Sheltered      House (book number MEB272) or Healing Plants (book number      MEB 2711.)</em>    </p>
