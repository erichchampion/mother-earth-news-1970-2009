            		<p><strong> MOTHER'S HANDBOOK</strong></p>          <h5 id="byline">      By Chris Huck    </h5>    <p>      <em>Finding property markers saves your time, expense and      trouble.</em>    </p>        <p>      Because I live in the country and have done some surveying,      I am often being asked about property boundaries. The      questions are varied: "How much does a surveyor cost?" "Can      I do it myself?" "What equipment do I need?" "What do my      property corners look like?" "What are the laws concerning      surveying and property boundaries?" "Where are my property      records?" People ask these questions, not from a desire to      fence and post their land, but because of pride of      ownership, the desire for knowledge, or - sometimes      - to protect themselves from the threat of      encroachment.    </p>    <p>      Take my friend up the road. For years, he had lived      peacefully on his 20-acre farm. Then a smooth operator      bought the property next door, and subdivision plans began      looming on his boundaries. My friend ended up paying a      surveyor $1,500 - just to ensure that the new      neighbor's ambitions wouldn't include any of <em>his</em>      farm.    </p>    <p>      A thin line separates the smooth operators of this world      from those of you who prefer to live and let live -      the boundary line of your property. Your right to build or      farm, your right to live on land the way you see fit, even      your family dog's right to roam at will - all stop at      that line. This article will tell you everything you need      to know to find it, <em>on the ground</em> . If the thought      of doing your own surveying scares you, don't worry. You      don't have to be a genius to find your property boundaries      - just a detective.    </p>    <p>      Knowing how to find your own property markers can save you      time, expense, and trouble. But be aware that there's a big      difference between <em>finding</em> established lines and      <em>setting</em> new ones (or adjusting incorrect old      ones). Only a licensed surveyor is legally qualified to set      or move lines.    </p>    <h3>      How to Read a Property Description    </h3>    <p>      You've heard it said that the job isn't over till the      paperwork is done? In this job, the paperwork comes first.      Don't set foot outside until you have in hand every      document that could help. First on the list is the portion      of your property deed called the <em>legal description</em>      : the description in words of your property lines. And      before you can understand how to decode that description,      you must learn which of the two common surveying methods      applies to your property. One is the metes and bounds      method; the other is the public land survey system.    </p>    <p>      <em>Metes and bounds</em> is the most common surveying      method and the one used almost exclusively in the East.      Metes and bounds defines property by its boundary lines,      each line consisting of direction (or bearing) and distance      (or length). Here is an example:    </p>    <p>      Beginning at a point 247 feet due east of Henly Fork,      thence N47W, 210 feet, thence N43E, 204 feet to an Oak,      thence S47E, 210 feet to a post, thence S43W, 204 feet to      the point of beginning. Containing 0.98 acres, more or      less.    </p>    <p>      Notice that each leg consists of both direction and      distance. With a compass and a tape measure, you could walk      around the perimeter.    </p>    <p>      The <em>public land survey system</em> evolved in response      to helter-skelter settlement in colonial times. In the      1700s, nobody knew how much land anyone owned, or where it      was. In northern Georgia, for instance, entrepreneurs sold      over 29 million acres in a three-county area that contained      only 9 million!    </p>		    <p>      Thomas Jefferson solved the problem. During his presidency,      the federal government sent a small army of surveyors      across the Appalachians with instructions to split the      frontier into squares, placing boundary markers every mile.      Thus, the public land survey system consists of a      checkerboard of square-mile lots, called <em>sections</em>      . Each one of these sections contains 640 acres and a      boundary marker at each corner.    </p>    <p>      To encourage people to fill up the sections, the government      created homestead allotments. The basic allotment was 160      acres - a quarter section. The surveyors marked these      boundaries, too, and called them quartercorners.    </p>    <p>      Now, all this won't help you unless you know how to read a      public land description (Fig. 1). It sounds hard until you      get the hang of it. Each quarter of a section bears the      name of its compass location: NE, NW, SE, SW-e.g., "the SW      1/4 of section 3." Want less than 160 acres? Chop the SW      1/4 into quarters again. Each quarter-quarter is 40 acres.      One of them could be named the NE 1/4 of the SW 1/4 (shaded      in Fig. 1). And so on down. (On occasion, adjacent quarters      will be combined to yield a "half," e.g., "the south 1/2 of      section 27.")    </p>    <p>      Thus, a public land description will not list boundary      lines. Jefferson designed the system so that <em>all</em>      boundary lines run north-south and east-west - along      the quarters as well as the sections. Since section      boundaries are exactly one mile long, subunit borders will      be exact fractions of a mile.    </p>    <h3>      Preparing for the Search    </h3>		    <p>      There are even better information sources than your deed.      The best (and sometimes most elusive) document you can lay      your hands on is the surveyor's map, or <em>plat</em> (Fig.      2). The plat translates that legal confusion of numbers and      terms on the deed into pictures. It may also show      references to natural landmarks, or triangulation data      which may locate a particular point.    </p>    <p>      Plat-chasing is a major pastime among surveyors. Your plat,      if one exists, may accompany your deed. Or it may languish      in city or county records (clerks' or surveyors' offices      would be the best places to search) or reside with a      previous owner. Plats of neighboring land are helpful, too.      They may show the location of a common boundary.    </p>    <p>      If you live in a subdivision or built-up area, you may be      wondering why your deed's legal description reads only "Lot      22, Rock Creek Estates" or "Tract A, First Addition." But      these, too, are metes and bounds surveys. The surveyors      created several lots at once, so they drew one map of the      whole thing. Deed descriptions merely refer to the master      plat, which you will find in the public records.    </p>    <p>      You should also keep an eye peeled for early versions of      your property description, surveyor's notes, and      descriptions of roads that border your land. Why? First, to      ensure that your deed doesn't contain mistakes; second, to      find out all you can about boundary markers - the key      to property lines.    </p>    <p>      You are now <em>nearly</em> ready to step into the      surveyor's shoes. First, though, you'll have to gather your      equipment. You'll need a compass, long measuring tape,      plumb bob, level, hatchet, some ribbon, and stakes. You'll      <em>also</em> need a willing assistant. Now check your      instruments. Do they read in the same numbers as the      survey? If not, you will have to translate.    </p>    <p>      Most people will have on hand the type of compass that uses      the directional measurement known as <em>azimuth</em> .      Being ornery as a rule, surveyors use another system,      called <em>bearings</em> . To learn how to translate one to      the other, see the sidebar "Converting Azimuths to      Bearings."    </p>    <p>      On to distances. We measure lengths in feet and inches,      don't we? Well, the surveyor uses either feet and      <em>tenths</em> of a foot (be very alert for this!) or a      venerable system called <em>chains</em> . Don't panic at      this. A chain measures 66 feet. Why 66 feet? Because it's      convenient for land computations. Ten square chains equal      one acre - which means to compute acreage rapidly,      all you have to do is find the number of square chains,      then move the decimal point once to the left. Also, one      mile stretches exactly 80 chains.    </p>    <p>      A hundredth of a chain - about eight inches -      is called a <em>link</em> . Old-timers also used a      quarter-chain measure (16-1/2 feet), calling it a rod,      pole, or perch.    </p>    <p>      I find that if I'm faced with a description written in      bearings and chains when my equipment reads in azimuths and      feet, my brain reels at the prospect of translating and      tramping about at the same time. It's far better to      translate all the degrees and distances on paper before you      set out.    </p>    <h3>      CONVERTING AN AZIMUTH TO A BEARING    </h3>    <p>      The normal hand compass is marked off in <em>azimuths</em>      . An azimuth is a direction - from 0° to 360°      - measured clockwise from due north. Thus, north is      0°, east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is      270°.    </p>    <p>      <em>Bearings</em> start with the same 360° circle, but      it is divided into quadrants of 90° each. On either      side of due north are the NE and NW quadrants. Likewise on      the south: SE and SW. Every direction reads as an angle to      the east or west from north or south.    </p>    <p>      Sound confusing? Let's look at an example:    </p>        <h3>      Azimuth    </h3>    <p>      <strong>This angle, roughly southwest, has an azimuth      reading of 230°.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      Bearing    </h3>    <p>      <strong>180° is due south, so 230° is due south      plus 50° to the west. Thus 230° becomes "an angle      from due south of 50° to the west" - or, in      surveyor's shorthand, S50W.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Got it? Let's try another one. What's the bearing      equivalent of azimuth 25°? If you said, "It's N25E" (an      angle from due north of 25° to the east), you're ready      to get out and start walking your boundary lines!    </p>    <h3>      Finally, the Fieldwork    </h3>    <p>      Now you can begin your scavenger hunt.    </p>    <p>      Step one: Always start from a known point. It must be      something you can absolutely match with the written record.      It may be a marker on your boundary, if someone has already      made a positive ID of it. More likely, it will be a road      crossing, a section corner, or even a neighbor's marker      (garnered from that plat you unearthed in the public      records). <em>Don't</em> trust ditch lines or fence      corners, unless the record mentions them.    </p>        <p>      Step two: Measure off the course, direction, and distance      exactly as the deed says. Flag the line with your ribbons      as you go. Make sure that your flags all line up straight      and in the right direction. (Your assistant can be a great      help here.) Watch out for any iron or steel objects or      anything carrying electric current while you walk -      they can attract the compass needle and throw your readings      off. If you come to a large obstruction, you can measure a      line <em>exactly</em> parallel to your boundary line for a      short distance until you get by the obstacle (Fig. 3).    </p>    <p>      Surveys always measure distance on a horizontal plane,      <em>not</em> along the ground slope. Unless you have a      calculator that's well versed in trigonometry (for equating      slope distance to horizontal), you, too, must measure on      the level. To do so, whenever you're traversing hilly land,      you and your assistant need to hold your tape (or a      measured length of string) along your directional line and      exactly level (use your level to determine this). Then, let      your plumb bob hang vertically down from the tape (or      string) end to determine where on the ground that      horizontally measured distance falls (Fig. 4). Repeat as      needed to accurately measure across rises and dips.    </p>    <p>      Step three: Once you've traveled the full distance in one      direction, search for the boundary marker. This is always      my favorite part. Will you know it when you see it? If      you're lucky, your plat or deed will mention how the      surveyor marked corners. If not, you're in for some      Sherlock Holmes-style detective work.    </p>                <p>      You are looking for some object artificially placed in a      certain spot (Fig. 5). What kind of object? If your      documents omit mention of the markers, look for a date of      survey, a clue to the type of marker used. Nowadays,      surveyors use well-anchored pipes or steel rods, capped      with brass, aluminum, or plastic, embossed with the      surveyor's registration number. But years ago, they used      anything handy. That included railroad spikes, wooden      stakes, even broken glass (usually from a convenient      whiskey bottle).    </p>    <p>      If you know you're seeking a <em>buried</em> pin, you can      use your compass as a metal detector (Fig. 6). Stand so the      compass needle is pointing due north, then turn the compass      vertical - so the needle points up. Keep facing north      and move the compass back and forth over the approximate      pin location, holding it about a half-inch to an inch off      the ground. If the needle spins downward and points to the      ground - dig.    </p>    <p>      The public land surveyors often spent months or years on      the frontier, and couldn't afford to carry around a load of      markers. Thus the identity of their monuments varied      widely. In the prairie, they filled pits with charcoal. In      the mountains, where they spent most of their time hacking      brush, they simply left an etched stone buried at the      section corner. They would use <em>witness trees</em> in      their notes to relocate the marker through triangulation.    </p>    <p>      Remember, markers don't last forever. Wooden stakes may      last less than 10 years. A "10 inch pine" in ancient notes      may be a 20-inch pine today - or a rotting stump.    </p>    <p>      Step four: Proceed to the next point. Don't give up if your      search has so far proven fruitless. The next corner may lie      in plain sight. And that's a bonus, because the more      corners you find, the greater your chances of finding the      remaining ones. You'll know what you're looking for and be      able to zero in on it from two sides.    </p>    <p>      One possible monkey wrench that may be throwing you oft:      Your deed bearings may not be written in terms of      <em>magnetic</em> north (a compass actually points to a      "false North Pole"). They may be written in <em>true</em>      north (referring to the real North Pole) or even in      <em>grid</em> north (referring to an artificial regional      standard that uses parallel "north-south" lines). Then too,      even magnetic north shifts some over time. So if your      bearing readings seem to be causing you trouble, take a      compass reading between <em>two known points</em> of your      deed or plat, and compare that to the recorded bearing. If      there's a significant difference, adjust all your bearing      readings as needed to compensate.    </p>    <p>      Step five: Preserve the markers you find, but DO NOT MOVE      THEM. They are considered legal boundaries only as long as      they remain exactly where they are. You cannot move them to      where you think they ought to be. Only a licensed surveyor      can do that. The difference between you and a surveyor      (besides $400 a day) is that only that person can establish      property lines and testify in court on their whereabouts.      If there are serious legal problems with your boundary, you      will need a surveyor.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Do-it-yourself surveying can stave off disputes with      your neigbors.</em>    </h3>    <h3>      Know Your Land    </h3>    <p>      So what have you accomplished? A lot. If you found some      corners, you may have staved of a boundary war with your      neighbor. Show him or her what you've found, so you'll      agree. Then paint a few trees or pile rocks around the spot      so it doesn't go to weeds. Don't force your grandkids to go      through the same search.    </p>    <p>      Even if you didn't turn up any corners, your time hasn't      been wasted. You've probably dug up some useful old      records, and that's half of what you'd pay a real surveyor      for.    </p>		    <h3>      AREA COMPUTATION    </h3>    <p>      If your property has a simple rectangular shape, you don't      need to read this. But what about those of you with      oddshaped lots with five or ten separate sides? Before you      throw in the towel, try this method for computing your      acreage.    </p>    <p>      First, make a scale drawing of your property on grid paper      (Step 1). It doesn't have to be entirely accurate, but it      should be large enough so you can write plenty of figures      inside. Write the direction (in bearings) and distance      along every boundary line.    </p>    <p>      Second, draw lines running north-south and/or east-west      through every angle point. You need be concerned only with      lines in the interior, and once they meet another inside      line, you need draw no further.    </p>    <p>      Your polygon is now divided into rectangles and right      triangles (Step 2). To figure out the area of the      triangles, all you need is a math book or calculator with      sine and cosine functions. Remember them from high school      trigonometry? In a right triangle, the sine equals the      length of the side opposite an angle divided by the length      of the hypotenuse (which, you'll notice, is always a      boundary line with a known length). A cosine equals the      adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.    </p>    <p>      You already know one angle of each triangle -      remember, the bearing is the angle from the north-south      line you drew. So if you look up the sine or cosine      (whichever is appropriate) of that angle, you can use that      and the length of the boundary line to solve for the      remaining sides of the triangle.    </p>    <p>      For example, take the shaded triangle from Step 2 -      one that has a hypotenuse of 917 feet running S13E (Step      3). The sine of 13° is .225.    </p>    <p>      Since .225 = opposite side/ 917, then the opposite side =      206. Now you can use the cosine of 13°, .974, to solve      for the angle's adjacent side: .974 = adjacent side/917 ...      or 893 feet. The area for a triangle is 1/2 base times      height, in this case 1/2 X 206 X 893 = 91,979 square feet.    </p>    <p>      As you work, write every calculated distance on the      appropriate grid line, and record the area of each      subfigure inside that shape. When you add all those areas      up at the end, you'll have your square footage. Divide that      by 43,560 and you'll know your acreage.    </p>
