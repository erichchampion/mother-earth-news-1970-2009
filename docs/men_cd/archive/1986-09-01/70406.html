                    <p>      <em>Nostalgia played a delicious role in MOM's picnic. So      did Snackin' Crackers, Braised Chicken Wings, Blackberry      Shortcakes. . .</em>    </p>    <p>      As our editorial staff perused past copies to pick "the      best of MOTHER" for issue 100, we kept running across      mouth-watering recipes that we hadn't gotten around to      enjoying for quite a while. "Why not," someone suggested,      "use some of our old favorites to make up the menu for the      upcoming editorial picnic?" And that's just what we did!    </p>        <h3>      Our Menu    </h3>    <p>      Snackin' Crackers and Cheese Spread<br />      Relish Pears<br />      Esther Shuttleworth's Beer Bread<br />      Braised Chicken Wings<br />      Leona's Fabulous Fruit Salad<br />      Carrot-Date-Cabbage Slaw<br />      Peanut Butter and Fruit Sandwiches<br />      Tomato/Cheese/Onion Sandwiches<br />      Blackberry Shortcakes<br />      Sunshine Fruit Drink    </p>    <p>      (Each of the following recipes makes approximately six      servings.)    </p>    <h3>      Snackin' Crackers    </h3>    <p>      2 cups whole wheat flour<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1/2 cup sesame seeds<br />      1/2 cup raw wheat germ<br />      1/4 cup vegetable oil<br />      1/2 cup cold water    </p>    <p>      Blend together the flour, salt, sesame seeds, and wheat      germ, then add the oil and mix well with a fork. Pour in      the cold water, mix, and continue to add water a tablespoon      at a time until the dough is soft and workable. Turn the      dough out onto a floured board and knead it for at least 10      minutes. Pull off a golf-ball-sized lump and roll it into a      ball. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out until      it's cardboard thin. Heat an ungreased cast-iron skillet as      hot as possible. Bake each cracker in the skillet until      it's light brown on the bottom, then flip it over and just      barely brown the other side (or bake the crackers on an      ungreased cookie sheet in a 400°F oven, turning as      described above to brown both sides). Allow the crackers to      cool thoroughly on a towel before storing them in an      airtight container.    </p>    <p>      <em>Per two 2"-diameter crackers:</em> 116 cal., 4 g pro.,      13 g carbo., 6 g fat, 130 mg sodium.
