             <h3>COUNTRY LORE</h3>             <h3>Carrot stuck in the ground? Solution: Screw it      up.</h3>        <h3>      Wheelbarrow Blues    </h3>    <p>      Having trouble with items falling from your heaping-full      wheelbarrow? If so, you'll want to try an idea that my      father, Cledit Nelson of Frazee, Minnesota, had. One day      Dad was pulling thistles in a field, and it didn't take him      long to get a bulk load on his wheelbarrow. The plants      weren't heavy, so he wanted to haul as many as possible to      save trips to the compost pile, but many of the weeds kept      falling off.    </p>    <p>      It occurred to him that he could use a common black rubber      "tie-down" strap with metal-hook ends-the type      normally used for tarps, boat covers, and so on. He hooked      a strap end to one side of the wheelbarrow, brought the      strap over the load's center, and hooked it to the other      side. His hefty thistle load stayed in place, and required      just one strap.    </p>    <p>      A tie-down of about three-feet long might do, but it      depends on the wheelbarrow's width and the strap's      elasticity. On many wheelbarrows the strap's hooks will      easily catch, but on others you might need to drill holes,      centering one on each side of the 'barrow to accommodate      the hooks.    </p>    <p>      Also, some materials, like dry leaves, are more difficult      to haul. To keep most of the leaves in place, place a tree      branch or two over the leaves before you strap it down.      When not in use, hook the strap onto the wheelbarrow      handles for easy access.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Gary Nelson<br />      Oakland, Arkansas</em>    </p>        <h3>      Uncorking the Carrot    </h3>    <p>      Have you ever gone to pull a carrot from your garden and      had the top break right off? Who wants to dig up the rest      of the carrot once that happens? Well, I have found a way      to make it easy: use a cork screw. Screw it in through the      part that is left in the ground and then yank. We even have      a corkscrew in which the "T" handle comes off. First we      screw in the center portion (this is easier because there's      no handle to get tangled in the greens), then we attach the      handle, and pull it right out.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Craig Johnson<br />      Pullman, Washington</em>    </p>    <h3>      A Muddy Finish    </h3>    <p>      I recently built a badly needed cabinet in my kitchen. It      is 4' wide, 16" deep, and about ceiling height. In the      interest of economy, I used waferboard for the doors. What      a mistake that was! The waferboard's rough texture looked      awful, even after applying several coats of paint. Then I      came up with an idea: I applied a thin coat of mud      (sheet-rock compound) to the face of the door using a      six-inch mud knife. The result was a perfectly smooth      cabinet that matched the texture of the sheet-rock walls of      the kitchen. It looks great.    </p>    <p>      <em>-James R. Brunner<br />      Las Cruces, New Mexico</em>    </p>    <h3>      A Healthy Slug Remedy    </h3>    <p>      You've all heard of using salt to kill slugs. Well, I place      a handful of bran every eight or 10 feet along walks and      garden paths. Slugs will collect on these little heaps of      bran and you can sweep them up come morning.    </p>    <p>      <em>-WC. Thompson<br />      Newtonville, Massachusetts</em>    </p>    <h3>      Hold 'em at Needlepoint    </h3>    <p>      I heard some unwelcome buzzing near my kitchen windows the      other day and realized there were insects outside who      either wanted to come in or build a nest way too close for      comfort. Since there was a tiny hole in one of my screens,      I decided to stop these unwanted guests from entering with      a plastic needlepoint canvas from my sewing basket. I laced      the canvas right onto the screen with dental floss (you can      also use fishing line). This made a durable blockade, and      because of the holes in the canvas, it allowed for plenty      of air circulation as well.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Dee L. Getchell<br />      East Lyme, Connecticut</em>    </p>    <h3>      Who Needs Mud Pies Anyway?    </h3>    <p>      It may be time to get rid of sandboxes. Many kids,      particularly toddlers, accidentally get sand in their eyes      and mouths. So I filled a sandbox with 25 pounds of      birdseed for my two-year-old daughter. Now my husband and I      don't have to worry about injuries and it's easy to sweep      up when she tracks it in the house. As with sand, children      can't resist pouring the box contents on the grass or      sidewalk-a wonderful way to feed birds.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Cynthia Mullis<br />      Streetman, Texas</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's note:</em> <strong>Save Country Lore!</strong>      <em>We know you love reading lore, but unfortunately, fewer      lore letters have been rolling in.
