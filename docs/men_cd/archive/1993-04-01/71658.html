                <p><strong>      ENERGY TIPS</strong>    </p>        <h3>      Getting in and out of the kitchen... for less.    </h3>       <p>      Choosing quicker and more efficient methods of cooking are      some of the easiest ways to save on your energy bill. The      average family cooks 1.5 meals a day and each of those      meals takes an average of 30 minutes of energy to prepare;      because traditional ovens have a considerable appetite for      energy, the yearly costs of serving hot food to the family      can be anywhere from $150 and up. But you can save      considerably on costs and still keep the oven fires burning      with a little advice.    </p>    <p>      As you might imagine, using as small an oven as possible      will be the most efficient way of preparing any meal, but      you might not realize just how disparate in their energy      consumption ovens are.    </p>    <p>      Several ways of cooking the same casserole are shown in the      following chart.    </p>    <p>      • Use as small a pan, as little water, as little      preheat time, and as little peeking in the oven as      possible.    </p>    <p>      • For stove-top cooking, consider using a pressure      cooker. By building steam pressure, they cook at a higher      temperature, reducing cooking time and energy.    </p>        <p>      • Keep burner pans (the metal pans under the burners      that catch grease) clean so they'll be more effective at      reflecting heat to the cookware. Blackened burner pans      absorb a lot of heat, reducing burner efficiency.    </p>    <p>      • If you use electric burners, solid disk elements,      and radiant elements under ceramic glass, use flat-bottomed      cookware that rests evenly on the burner surface. The ideal      pan has a slightly concave bottom because when it heats,      the metal expands and the bottom flattens out. Electric      elements are considerably less efficient if the pan does      not have good contact.    </p>    <p>      • Always cook with the lid on your pans. Cooking      without lids can take three times as much energy.    </p>    <p>      • If you have a gas range, make sure that the gas      burns blue. If the flame is yellow, the fuel is burning      inefficiently and the range should be checked by the gas      company.    </p>		    <p>      • To reduce cooking time, defrost foods in the      refrigerator prior to cooking.    </p>    <p>      • Food cooks more efficiently in ovens where air can      circulate freely. Don't lay foil on the racks. If possible,      stagger pans on upper and lower racks to improve air flow.    </p>    <p>      • Cook double portions when possible, and freeze the      remainder. Less energy is required to reheat than to cook      the dish over again.    </p>    <p>      • Using glass or ceramic pans in ovens allows you to      reduce cooking temperature by 25°F with no extra time      required.    </p>    <p>      • Microwaves operate better when the interior is      clean. Spills will absorb energy waves just as readily as      the cooking food.    </p>    <p>      <em>From</em> Consumer Guide to Home Energy Savings      <em>(1991), published by the American Council for an      Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
