        <p>Juneau, Alaska, recently garnered national attention for its response to an electricity crisis that drove utility bills through the roof. On April 16, <a title="a series of avalanches" href="http://www.aelp.com/reconnecting/repair%20progress/repairprogress.htm" target="_blank">a series of avalanches</a> damaged and destroyed the transmission towers along a 1.5 mile stretch of the line that delivers hydropower to the city. As a result, Juneau had to supply all of its power from diesel generators, despite record-high prices for diesel fuel.</p><p>Diesel fuel consumption rapidly shot above 80,000 gallons per day, but once residents found out that electricity rates would increase from about 11  cents per kilowatt-hour to 52.5  cents per kilowatt-hour, the city rapidly pursued ways to save energy. As a result, the city's peak power usage dropped from about 50 megawatts before the avalanches to below 30 megawatts by late May. Total electricity usage dropped from about 1,000 megawatt-hours per day before the crisis to roughly 600 megawatt-hours per day in late May, a 40 percent drop. For the last week in May, the city's diesel fuel use averaged only about 35,000 gallons per day.</p><p>The power crisis is now solved, as <a title="Alaska Electric Light and Power Co." href="http://www.aelp.com/reconnecting/reconmenu.htm" target="_blank">Alaska Electric Light and Power Co.</a> announced on June 1 that the hydroelectric transmission line has been restored. However, the high emergency rates will remain in effect until the next billing cycle, so the city still needs to conserve electricity.</p><p>To help residents reduce their electricity use, the city mailed a flyer to all households noting ways to save energy, such as switching to <a title="compact fluorescent light bulbs" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Renewable-Energy/2007-04-01/Bright-Ideas-for-Home-Lighting.aspx" target="_blank">compact fluorescent light bulbs</a>, microwaving, washing clothes in cold water, and line-drying clothes. In addition, both the <a title="city" href="http://www.juneau.org/energy/" target="_blank">city</a> and the <a title="Juneau Economic Development Council" href="http://www.jedc.org/electricity.htm" target="_blank">Juneau Economic Development Council</a> created Web pages with information on how to save energy, while a group of concerned citizens launched <a title="Juneau Unplugged" href="http://www.juneauunplugged.com/" target="_blank">Juneau Unplugged</a>, a community campaign to encourage energy savings.</p><h5><span lang="en-us">Reprinted from the <a title="EERE Network News" href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm" target="_blank">EERE Network News</a>, a free newsletter of the U.S. Department of Energy.</span> </h5>

The city was able to reduce its electricity use by 40 percent through numerous efforts.
