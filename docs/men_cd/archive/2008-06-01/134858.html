        <p>So you’ve heard the good word about alternative energy and green building, and you’re ready to make the switch - right? Whether you’re ready to build or remodel your home to make it green, or just want to learn about renewable energy systems, there may be no better resource than the Solar Living Institute (<a title="SLI" href="http://www.solarliving.org/default.asp" target="_blank">SLI</a>) in Hopland, Calif.</p><p>Since 1998, the Institute has welcomed thousands of people to workshops, festivals, lectures and celebrations with the mission “to promote sustainable living through inspirational environmental education.” The Institute has gone a long way toward helping our culture unhook from the IV of fossil fuels and soak up the joy of solar living instead. The eager learners are playing an important role in a renewable future, and whether or not you live in California, the Institute can help you join that movement.</p><h3>Education: Hands-On Workshops</h3><p>Here’s just a taste of the wide variety of topics covered in the Institute’s year-round (and affordable - most are $100 to $200) workshops:</p><ul><li>Installing all kinds of solar systems: electric, heating and water-heating</li><li>Brewing biodiesel</li><li>Making natural plasters</li><li>Building with straw bales</li><li>Building or buying electric vehicles</li><li>Calculating the cost/payback of renewable energy systems</li><li>Starting a green retail business</li><li>Beekeeping and honey production</li><li>Building an earth oven</li><li>Biointensive backyard gardening</li></ul><p>View the full list of 2008 workshops <a title="here" href="http://www.solarliving.org/workshops/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3>Solfest: Annual Celebration of Solar Living</h3><p>The Institute is perhaps best-known for SolFest, its tremendous annual summer gathering in celebration of renewable energy and sustainability. There’s a lot to be learned here, too, but the two-day festival also fulfills the official mission “to always remember to have fun in whatever we are doing.”</p><p>And it’s hard not to have a good time at this gorgeous 12-acre spread in northern California.

Internships last 3 to 6 months; in exchange, you can expect an amazing firsthand education in sustainability, plus some fresh food grown on the premises and accommodation in the Intern Village (read: rustic). Not convinced? Check out intern testimonials <a title="here" href="http://www.solarliving.org/display.asp?catid=52,63" target="_blank">here</a>. Convinced?
