        <p>I’ve been after my rose-growing wife to buy chickens for years now. I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to convince her that chickens would help control the Japanese beetles that damage her flowers.</p><p>With last year’s hot, dry summer here in Ohio, the beetle population was out of control, so until we get those chickens, we put up a few beetle traps that use scent lures to attract and trap pests.</p><p>When the trap bags fill up with the beetles, I put them in the freezer for about a day to chill them. Then I feed the beetles to the fish in our pond. The catfish can eat a dozen of them in a mouthful and the bluegill love them, too!</p><h5>Bob Falk<br />Bluffton, Ohio</h5>
