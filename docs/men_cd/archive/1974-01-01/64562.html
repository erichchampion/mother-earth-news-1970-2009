                        <p>      Robin Rye's article on sheep raising ("Life with the      Woolies", MOTHER NO. 23) was basically good, but we feel      that a few points should be emphasized. Our advice is based      on personal experience with both commercial and purebred      farm flocks in Minnesota, Wisconsin and California.    </p>    <p>      First, when you start your small homestead flock, we      suggest that you buy a purebred (but not necessarily      registered) meat-type ram: blackfaced Suffolk, Hampshire or      Shropshire ... but choose wool-type ewes of whatever      whitefaced breed is most suited to your climate. That way      you'll get lots of wool for sale or hand spinning, yet      meaty lambs for the table.    </p>    <p>      Although it may seem more natural to let your ram run with      the flock all year-as Ms. Rye recommends-we      don't encourage you to do so ... for two reasons. First, he      can hurt both the ewes (in late pregnancy) and newborn      lambs. We've seen males butting females and their young,      and even trying to mount ewes directly after lambing. Why      take the chance?    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the main reason for separating your ram from the      rest of the flock, however, is so that you'll know when the      offspring are due and be able to prepare for the event.      (Some ewes can come in heat all year round, and it's the      presence of the ram that triggers ovulation.) A ewe will      give birth about 147 days after she's bred, so turn the      male in with the flock about five months before you want      your lambs born. The ideal time of year depends on your      climate. In the Midwest we loosed our ram at Thanksgiving,      but here in California we do so in mid-August.    </p>    <p>      Remember also that by controlling the time of breeding and      lambing you can feed your sheep more economically. For the      best use of fodder, flush the ewes (feed them extra grain      or hay) 17 days before and 17 days after you turn your ram      in with them. This will increase your twinning rate.      Throughout pregnancy, the sheep need only good pasture or      alfalfa hay.    </p>    <p>      Give the ewes grain again just before lambing and make sure      they have adequate alfalfa or forage until the young are      weaned. Between that time and their next breeding the      animals need not be fed much. They can lose weight during      this period and stay perfectly healthy, since the      nonpregnant, non-lactating female has a much lower      nutritional requirement. Most small pet flocks are overfed,      which is bad for them and makes breeding difficult.    </p>    <p>      Although Ms. Rye objects to the docking of sheep, we feel      it's important. If you've ever seen a young animal with its      rear end eaten raw by maggots-and this condition can      kill a lamb-you'll agree with us. It's easier to keep      the rump clean when the tail has been docked, and the      operation, properly done, is safe, painless and bloodless.    </p>    <p>      Also, be sure to castrate your male lambs (another safe,      painless and bloodless procedure when it's done right).      Young rams can and will breed their own mothers, sisters      and aunts before they themselves are big enough to butcher.      We always dock and castrate when we turn loose the lamb and      its mother about a week after birth.    </p>    <p>      One last point: Ms. Rye says foot rot is rare ... and so it      is ... on firm, dry pastures. But be sure to check every      hoof of every new sheep you bring onto your place. (Healthy      feet are hard and strong, with no bad odor.) Foot rot is      infectious and-before you know it-the condition      can spread through your whole flock, besides contaminating      your truck, your barn and the land itself. Don't take a      chance!    </p>    <p>      Take care of your sheep-be a true shepherd to      them-and they'll reward you with food, clothing and      companionship.
