                    <p>      In MOTHER NO. 23, Mike Kiernan discussed the problems      created by this country's expanding pet population. I'd      like to add a word on a couple of alternative methods of      animal birth control that Mike didn't mention. One is      available now-I have it done all the time-and      the other is a very promising possibility for the near      future.    </p>    <p>      Spaying and neutering (the techniques of surgical      sterilization to which Mike refers) are objectionable to      many people, myself included, because they involve desexing      the animal by removing the ovaries or testicles. This is      <em>not</em> necessary to achieve sterility. A male pet can      have a vasectomy, and a female a Fallopian tubal      ligation-just as humans can-without any      impairment of its sex life. Alternatively, the female's      uterus (womb) can be removed without disturbing the ovaries      (which are also taken in spaying). I prefer this "plain"      hysterectomy for my animals over the tying of the tubes      because the former method eliminates the possibility of      uterine infection-a common problem later on.    </p>    <p>      Since her operation, one of my female Siamese cats has a      normal heat period every two or three months ... the others      less often. The animals tend to gain weight (I assume      because their appetite level is designed to build them up      for frequent pregnancies) but they show no change in      personality or behavior. When there are young kittens in      the house, one of the sterilized females produces milk and      helps to mother them ... so she's not deprived of even that      joy.    </p>    <p>      I've never had any particular trouble finding a      veterinarian to operate in this way anywhere we've been      stationed ... although some of them take a very lofty tone      with me for being so dirty-minded as to request it. ("Tell      Jake to sleep on the roof.") The Fallopian tubal ligation      and the "plain" hysterectomy cost about the same as      spaying. One specialist I know of charges more for a      vasectomy than for castration ("neutering"), another      charges less.    </p>    <p>      A population-limiting possibility for the future-one      that's now being researched-is the use of      intrauterine devices for dogs. According to preliminary      reports, my vet says, such a gadget would cost about $10.00      if installed by a professional. Since the operation doesn't      involve surgery, he thinks there's a chance that paramedics      might later be able to perform this service and thus reduce      tremendously the cost of a birth control clinic run by a      city or humane society. The IUD wouldn't interfere with the      dog's sexual activities while in place, and could be      removed if the owner desired to breed the animal later. The      last report my informant had was that this technique was at      least two years away from public use.    </p>
