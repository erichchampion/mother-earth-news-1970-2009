                        <p>      Whole wheat, most of us agree, is fine food ... but not      everyone enjoys it cooked "as is". Back in MOTHER NO. 20,      Betty Warner urged cereal lovers to try the parched and      cracked variation known as bulgur (and described how to      make and use that product at home). As some of us have      learned from following Betty's directions, this Middle      Eastern specialty-also called bulgor, bhulgar,      burghrol or boulgour, depending on what part of that area      the speaker hails from-keeps well, cooks more quickly      than the whole grain and takes on a pleasant crunchy      texture and nutty taste from the roasting.    </p>    <p>      The traditional way to make bulgur is by boiling and      sundrying whole wheat and partially cracking the kernels      with stones (see MOTHER NO. 20 for more complete      directions). Those of us who do roughly the same thing in      our own kitchens (with more advanced equipment) may not be      aware of this country's large-scale bulgur industry, which      has been turning out parched wheat by mass-production      methods for the last 20 years. This is the subject of an      informative booklet called <em>Bulgur ... A New Wheat      Food</em> recently sent to MOTHER by Protein Cereal      Products International, an association which promotes the      use of the product in the U.S. and overseas.    </p>    <p>      The American interest in bulgur dates from the 1950's      (back when we had a food surplus, remember?) and grew out      of a combined effort by wheat growers, millers and      government agencies to find an easily stored cereal product      that would be acceptable both on the open market and in      various domestic and foreign aid programs. The ancient      technique of parching and cracking turned out to be a      satisfactory answer, and bulgur labeled "Made in U.S.A."      became a fairly common article on the shelves of      well-stocked supermarkets.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, the product that was once thought of as a good      use for surplus wheat may turn out to be just as well      suited to a time of scarcity. It won't be long now before      many of us feel a need to dig out our copies of <em>Diet      for a Small Planet</em> (which we conscientiously bought      but never got around to using) and take a hard look at      possible sources of adequate protein from the correct      combination of plant and dairy foods. Those who wisely set      aside part of their land for small-scale cereal growing,      and those who can buy good whole wheat or commercial bulgur      locally, may be especially interested in Frances Moore      Lappé's suggestions for making the most of that      grain.    </p>    <p>      Bulgur should be a good subject for experiments with      vegetable protein, since (according to PCPI's booklet) the      parching process seems to have little effect on whole      wheat's nutritional qualities. (On a per-pound basis,      there's a slight loss in fat, thiamine and phosphorus ...      but a slight gain in protein and possibly in some other      nutrients, depending on what kind of wheat is used. Hard      red winter wheat makes a more nourishing bulgur than white:      11.3% protein by weight as compared to 8.5%.)      Combined-by Ms. Lappé's rules-with milk,      cheese, soy or sesame, what used to be a rather exotic      import item can become a useful part of anyone's personal      answer to the meat shortage.    </p>    <p>      Whether you're an old friend of this tasty, nutritious      cereal or just feel like trying it out, you may want to      sample some of the recipes provided by PCPI. Here, for      those who missed the article in MOTHER NO. 20, is the basic      cooking rule given in the association's brochure:    </p>        <p>      Cooked bulgur can then be used as a cereal or side dish ...      or it can become the mainstay of a meal in savory      combinations like the three that follow    </p>        <p>      Finally, here's a recipe that calls for dry bulgur, brewed      with lamb and vegetables into a strengthening winter soup      which can just about make a meat in itself.    </p>        <p>      If you'd like further information on bulgur-and a      wider selection of recipes-write Protein Cereal      Products International, 1030 15th Street N.W., Suite 760,      Washington, D.C. 20005.-JN.<br />    </p>
