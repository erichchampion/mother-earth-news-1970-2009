    <p>
        <p>Our experiments with methane, here at THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, have convinced us that over-the-road use of biogas is just about the poorest possible way to burn this fuel. Yet we're currently constructing several prototype "methane bugs" ... ultra-small and ultra-light vehicles designed expressly for operation on our own homemade natural gas.</p><p>Why this apparent contradiction? Because we figure we'll be able to lick any methane problem we're likely to encounter if we can find a practical method of powering an automobile with the fuel.</p><p>Now there's no question in our minds about the actual operation of an internal combustion engine on "swamp gas". Dad's work with our trusty '48 Chevy powerplant and a few other research projects have proven-to our satisfaction-that homemade methane is a nearly ideal fuel for such beasties: it's easy enough to plumb up, it deposits far less crud in an engine than gasoline and it spews a relatively low amount of pollutants into the air as it burns.</p><p>This wonder fuel does have one slight drawback, however: methane is the lightest of the gaseous hydrocarbons and at atmospheric pressure-it takes approximately 135–160 cubic feet of pure methane (or 180–250 cubic feet of bio-gas) to equal one gallon of gasoline. This presents a problem of sheer bulk: unless you want to tow a dirigible around behind you, you're going to find your range severely limited if you try to operate the typical Detroit Juggernaut on homemade natural gas.</p><p>There are at least six or seven possible ways around this situation, however, and we're going to try them all:</p><p>[1] Homemade methane can be "refined" so that each cubic foot of the gas has the maximum possible Btu value.</p><p>[2] A special lightweight (it takes less fuel to push around less pounds) mini-vehicle can be designed just for operation on bio-gas.</p><p>[3] That super-compact automobile can be fitted with as large a fuel tank as possible.</p><p>[4] The ultra-light car's methane tank should be a pressure bottle able to withstand from 400 to 3,000 psi so that relatively large quantities of bio-gas can be compressed into the container.</p><p>[5] The vehicle's engine/transmission/drive-train assembly should be the smallest, most efficient combination possible. "Most efficient"-in this case-probably meaning a four-cycle, high-compression, air-cooled powerplant coupled to a stick shift.</p><p>[6] The mini-car should be carefully conceived to deliver maximum utility when operated within a particular-and somewhat limited (by 1972, but certainly not 1980 standards)-performance envelope: two place, minimum luggage, rather leisurely acceleration, 55 mph top speed, 200-mile range.</p><p>[7] The operator of the vehicle should be trained to drive the car for maximum fuel economy: easy starts, constant cruising speeds, etc.</p><p>If this all sounds like something of a drag well, we're sorry about that. The alternative may well be no driving at all (or motoring down the highway on gasoline that costs better than $1.00 a gallon).</p>
