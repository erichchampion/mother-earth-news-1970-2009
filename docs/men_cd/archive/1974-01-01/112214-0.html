        <p class="caption">The DeKorne combination root cellar and bathhouse under construction. The 55-gallon drum on the roof of the bathing facility is connected via plastic pipe to a water heater inside. Jim says that the system's pressure is quite sufficient for the satisfactory operation of a shower. Eventually, the root cellar portion of this structure will be banked with dirt. The still-under-construction stone wall in the photo will hold that earth in place.</p>
