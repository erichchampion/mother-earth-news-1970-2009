                          <h5 id="byline">        by: Dave Caudill      </h5>			<hr />    <p>      A couple of your contented subscribers passed on your      magazine for our inspection (thinking, I suppose, to      enlighten our gross ignorance). We call ourselves organic      farmers and-until we read your      publication-believed we were self-sufficient. I must      point out at once that we're not turned on by the same      things that delight the younger generation . . . we're just      old-fashioned, and have isolated ourselves from our      neighbors, who think we're slightly out of our minds.      Still, even without books or knowledge to guide us, we've      done fairly well.    </p>    <p>      I'll grant that I could have used some of your helpful      hints at times . . . especially when we blew our five-acre      dream in northern California. We were in paradise, except      that we had no water. Our entire supply had to be hauled      from 25 miles away. I dug a well (by hand, with an axe) to      a depth of 15 feet. The real estate agent had said that if      I didn't reach water at that point he'd have a shaft      drilled at his own personal expense ... but when I'd got      down to 23 feet all he said was, "Well, well, that sure is      a deep hole."    </p>    <p>      Another of that agent's famous remarks was, "It never snows      around here." You guessed it: We were totally unprepared      for the four feet of snow which fell in September. By good      luck, the forest rangers vaguely remembered that some      idiots were living in a trailer house on the mountain. They      checked on us periodically to find out if we were still      alive, and plowed the road so we could get out. The whole      affair ended with us living in the valley ... but living.    </p>    <p>      At present I raise a variety of animals (mostly goats and      rabbits) and poultry (geese, pigeons and chickens). The      chickens are Araucanas-the "rumpless" variety, which      lack upstanding tail feathers-and I've served as      regional secretary for the International Araucana Society      for the past year. I've also written a book about the breed      in which I've tried to debunk some widely held erroneous      beliefs, but the work may never see the light, since, so      far, it's failed to attract much interest and I can't      afford to publish it myself. Such are the tides of life.    </p>    <p>      Here are a few hints on goatkeeping I'd like to share: Lots      of carrots and garlic in the animals' diet will cure      intestinal parasites, or perk them up when they're in poor      health and get them back into production. At first you may      have a problem getting the goats to eat the garlic, but      after a few tries they'll nuzzle you for it.    </p>    <p>      A good armload of rose leaves and stems will act as a fine      overall tonic, and the same amount of bean straw, given      along with the regular hay ration, will keep the goats'      stomachs in working order. This fodder is cheap (we pay      about a dollar a bale) and, in many areas, available free.      It's about as high in nutritional value as alfalfa, but      should not be the animals' sole source of crude roughage.      Bean straw contains lots of beans-which the goats      love-so feed it sparingly at first to avoid gas.    </p>    <p>      Scours in goats is easily cured by a dose of blackberry tea      (made from the leaves and roots of any blackberry plant) in      the kids' milk ration or by an armload of roots and foliage      given to the older animals. This remedy has none of the      aftereffects common to patent cures, which leave the      patients incapacitated for weeks before total recovery.    </p>    <p>      I picked up a six-week-old kid at auction for      $3.50-in this day of high meat prices-because      it was about dead from scours. I took the youngster home,      fed it blackberry tea in its milk and one week later sold      it back to the auction for $12.00. The revived kid was      eating like a horse and frisking as though it had never      known a sick day. (The same method will effect an amazing      cure of diarrhea in humans ... in some cases overnight. It      won't leave the stomach queasy, and a healthy appetite will      be retained.)    </p>    <p>      Goat cream, which is usually hard to obtain, will rise      quickly if a tablespoon of cow's milk is added to some milk      from a goat. I've been told that the goat's fluid lacks an      enzyme needed to make its butterfat separate, and that this      addition supplies the missing factor. Whatever the reason,      it works.    </p>    <p>      I'm an advocate of herbs for human use as well as for      livestock, and have a few ideas to suggest.    </p>    <p>      A COFFEE SUBSTITUTE may be made from chicory (those pretty      blue flowers one sees along the highway in the morning).      The roots are dug and cleaned, put into a slow oven and      roasted until dry. They may then be ground in a food or      coffee mill and perked in a pot or boiled like frontier      coffee. The liquid looks just like water but tastes exactly      like the more common breakfast drink.    </p>    <p>      VEGETABLE RENNET: Stinging nettle (a relative of the mints,      called "electric grass" by some people) makes a      satisfactory rennet for cheese. The leaves of this plant      also serve as an excellent green when boiled.    </p>    <p>      HERB WINE: This drink, fermented from stinging nettles,      mallow, wild mints and dandelion flowers, is bitter, but      very good as a tonic. It's best made with honey instead of      sugar.    </p>    <p>      WILLOW BARK TEA is an excellent headache remedy. Only the      black willow is generally supposed to contain the salicylic      acid which effects the cure, but any botanist will tell you      that <em>all</em> species of the genus have this property.      The bark is shredded, dried over a fire or in a slow oven      and ground for storage in a jar or dry pouch.    </p>    <p>      To make the tea, boil one cup of water for every tablespoon      of powdered bark, pour the bubbling liquid over the herb      and allow the mixture to stand overnight. The dosage is two      tablespoons of the infusion to half a glass of water. The      medicine is bitter, but can be mixed with mint or other      teas to make it more palatable ... or a spoonful of honey      can be added.    </p>    <p>      PILLOWS FOR INSOMNIACS can be made of heather leaves sewed      into pillowcases. I don't know what properties make it      work, but the method is effective (it was used for      sleepless patients in Germany during World War II). I find      that to be really useful the pillow must be "fluffed" just      before retiring.</p><p> SALVE: A good, all-around, odor-free      ointment can be made from the following ingredients: equal      parts of lard or any substitute (vaseline could be used);      elderberry bark, dried and pounded; dried and ground      elderberry leaves, comfrey leaves and roots, kelp and oak      bark. (This last item has no medicinal properties as far as      I know, but is a good odor depressant.) Mix all the      ingredients together and store the result in a tightly      sealed jar.    </p>    <p>      The salve is good for all open wounds and can be used as a      poultice.    </p>    <p>      Corns and bunions are treated by applying the ointment      every day and wrapping the affected part in a clean      bandage. Usually the problem is gone within a week.</p><p>      ARTHRITIS REMEDY: My grandfather insists that a buckeye      kernel carried in the pocket will relieve arthritis. I      should warn you, however, that this is the same guy who was      told that the stings of 100 bees would also have that      effect. He tried the idea, and in the course of the      treatment was asked by a friend if it was working. "Well,      no," said my grandfather, "but at least I'm not thinking      about the pain from my arthritis." (It's a family joke to      call this sort of thing a "Chinese cure" . . . after the      old saw about the Chinese cure for headaches: Take a hammer      in your right hand and vigorously strike the large toe on      your left foot. The pain in your head will go away.)    </p>    <p>      Here are a few more assorted items I'll throw in while I'm      at it:    </p>    <p>      DRIED FOOD: Thinly sliced tomatoes may be sun dried and put      into jars or waterproof sacks for winter use. To      reconstitute the fruit, simply place the slices in water      and use them as is (they taste exactly like freshly picked      tomatoes) or drop them into the soup pot or the juicer.</p><p> If      you have trouble with bugs in stored dehydrated food, dry      some horsemint (bergamot) leaves and space them among the      packages.    </p>    <p>      HONEY: Uncooked honey will crystallize in storage after a      time, but will still retain an excellent taste. (Some      people let this happen on purpose, for ease in keeping and      because they like to use the sweetening dry.) If heated,      the honey loses many of its enzymes and-to all      purposes-is a dead food.    </p>    <p>      Honey may be stored in the freezer in small containers and      defrosted as needed. It will lose nothing in flavor and      will be exactly as fresh as when put away.</p><p> Uncooked honey      right from the hive (with the comb, if desired) costs only      35 cents-40 cents a pound ... in contrast to the cooked      product, which now sells for 75 cents a pound.    </p>    <p>      KOFTA (ARAB BREAD): Here's an ancient recipe from the Near      East. Everyone who tries this likes it. You'll need 2 cups      of warm water, 1 package of yeast, 1 teaspoon of salt and      4-1/2 cups of unsifted flour. Pour the water into a mixing      bowl, and stir in the yeast until it's dissolved. Add the      salt and slowly stir in the flour. Beat the mixture until      it's smooth. Scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl,      cover the container and let the mass rise until doubled      (about one hour).    </p>    <p>      Stir down the risen dough and divide it into 12 equal parts      (or make loaves if you want).Put the segments on a floured      board, cover and let them stand half an hour. Set two      rounds at a time on an oiled and floured cookie sheet and      press them lightly around the edges to flatten them. This      forces air bubbles into the center of the bread to make a      hollow for the filling.</p><p> Place the sheet on an oven rack at      the lowest level and bake the kofta at 350°F for 20      minutes. The bread will puff but will not brown. Repeat the      process with the other rounds.When all are done, place them under the broiler for one      minute to brown their tops. The finished product will keep      for a week without refrigeration and can be used hot or      cold. To make koftesi (sandwiches of meat or other      fillings) slit open the edge of a bun a third of the way      around and insert the filling.    </p>    <p>      This bread has always been      our favorite at picnics and dinner and makes a satisfactory      take-along travel lunch. We think one of the best fillings      is strips of any type of meat boiled in a soup made of      onions, carrots and celery.The meat is removed when done and stuffed into the bun on      top of a tablespoon of chopped lettuce and celery. The      koftesi is then dipped in a small bowl of the soup with      each bite, or the broth may be drunk along with the      sandwich.    </p>    <p>      HOMEMADE WINE is more likely to turn out as      desired if an air seal is placed on top of the fermenting      vehicle. I use gallon jars for this process, and wrap the      mouth of each jug with a paper towel folded about an inch      wide. Then I put a plastic bag directly over the top and      fasten it in place with a rubber band.    </p>    <p>      AN EFFECTIVE RESTRAINING REMARK TO SMOKERS (in reply to      their usual protest, "But they're my cigarettes!"): "Yes,      but you're polluting my air."    </p>    <p>      CANNED GOODS: If you must buy the stuff, check the weights      and sizes of the products. The "family" can, may cost more      and contain less than two of the smaller containers, which      sometimes hold as much as a pound more between them than      the so-called economy size.    </p>    <p>      Thanks for the pleasant ear and, by now, blurring eye, and      best wishes to all at MOTHER (locally known as MUTTI ERD      ... we're all Dutchmen around here, as you might guess).    </p>
