        <p class="body">While avian flu is certainly cause for concern, we’re convinced backyard coops are part of the solution, not part of the problem. According to Michael Greger, M.D. and author of <span class="sidebarbodyital"><em>Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching,</em></span> “Never once that we know of has a highly pathogenic flu virus ever arisen in flocks kept humanely outdoors. The emergence and spread of the bird flu virus is facilitated by the overcrowding, filth, stress-impaired immunity, and lack of adequate ventilation and sunlight inherent in intensive confinement systems.” Dr. Greger’s outstanding new book is available at <span class="sidebarbodyital"><a title="www.MotherEarthShopping.com" href="http://www.motherearthshopping.com/" target="_blank">www.MotherEarthShopping.com</a></span>, and you can sign up for bird flu updates at <span class="sidebarbodyital"><a title="www.birdflubook.com" href="http://www.birdflubook.com/" target="_blank">www.birdflubook.com</a></span>.</p>
