        <p>As a child, hollyhocks were more than a flower for me. I had a secret hideaway among the 5-foot-tall plants, and we made little hollyhock dolls by tooth-picking an unopened bud as a “head” onto an upside-down hollyhock flower “skirt.”</p><p class="clbody">When I moved to Kansas, I decided to plant a flower garden at the country house I had restored. I wanted to grow local seeds, gathered from tried and true plants. I got the real thing from a small-town grandmother who got her seeds from her own grandmother.</p><p class="clbody">This is year two for my hollyhock garden, and here in Kansas, my garden is beautiful, magical and exactly what I wished for.</p><h5>Evelyn Wray<br />Luray, Kansas</h5>
