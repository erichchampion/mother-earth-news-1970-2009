        	     		<p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>        <p>A hot tip for seed starting, and more.    </p>        <p>      For years I had problems with birds pulling up as much as      50% of my germinating sweet corn. A friend advised me to      sprinkle lime on the row, and on either side too, just as      the corn breaks through the soil. Since doing this I      haven't lost a bit of corn.    </p>    <p>      -Tim Basinger<br />      Campbellsburg, Indiana    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Choice of Experience</strong>    </p>    <p>      I start more than 500 seedlings in flats each spring, and      over many years I've experimented with various      bottom-heating methods to speed the sprouting process and      promote deep root growth. My time-saving favorite is a      large electric food-warming tray (they're fairly common at      garage sales and secondhand stores). With the tray's heat      control at the lowest setting, an entire flat can be      sprouted in 48 to 72 hours. Plastic wrap placed loosely      over the top retains moisture. As each flat of seedlings      sprouts, I set it under fluorescent lights in our cool      basement and keep it moistened with rainwater collected      throughout the summer and stored in gallon plastic jugs.    </p>    <p>      -Barbara A. Sabatos<br />      Howell, Michigan    </p>        <p>      <strong>A Blend of Friends</strong>    </p>    <p>      Good cooks know that basil and tomatoes make for a tasty      combination, but I carry this a step further. Once my      tomato plants get a good start in the garden, I grow basil      at the base of each one. Not only do I have dried basil for      seasoning, but my tomatoes seem to have an especially      delicious flavor.    </p>    <p>      -Bette Caldwell<br />      Stronghurst, Illinois    </p>    <p>      <strong>Vinyl Verifiers</strong>    </p>    <p>      I make plant and row markers by cutting strips from scrap      vinyl siding. The vinyl can be easily cut with tin snips or      a knife, is virtually indestructible, and can be labeled      with a pencil (which is erasable) or waterproof ink (which      can be washed off with ammonia). A siding contractor would      probably give you all the material you'd need to make as      many markers as you wish.    </p>    <p>      - Grant Kothiringer<br />      Seneca, South Carolina    </p>    <p>      <strong>Plentiful Peas</strong>    </p>    <p>      I've got a trick that keeps moles from ruining my rows of      peas. When I'm ready to plant the seeds, I shake them in a      can into which I've poured about a teaspoonful of kerosene.      By also planting early to harvest before summer, I've      always had a good crop.    </p>    <p>      -Thelma A. Graham<br />      Decatur, Michigan    </p>    <p>      <strong>Get Ready, Get Net, Go</strong>    </p>    <p>      As a children's dance teacher, I've spent many an hour      constructing costumes of nylon net. But even if I didn't      have all those scraps to use up, I find the material so      handy I'd buy it anyway. Here are four ways nylon net helps      me garden.    </p>    <p>      1. A handful of net makes a sturdy scrubber to clean      flowerpots and gardening tools.    </p>    <p>      2. To start seeds I use plastic foam cups with drainage      holes punched in the bottom. Before filling the cups with      potting soil, I line each one with a 10-inch square of net.      When transplanting, the whole bundle is easily lifted out      of the cup and into the ground, with no shock to the roots.      They also have no difficulty growing through the holes in      the net, and the screen seems to protect the plants from      cutworms.    </p>    <p>      3. I tuck a small piece of net into the opening at the top      of each hot cap. It keeps insects out while allowing the      air to circulate.    </p>    <p>      4. My husband built a series of cubes ranging in size from      12 inches square to 40 inches. The cubes are actually      box-shaped frames made of one-inch lumber strips. To each      of these I stapled netting to cover five sides; white net      for sun-loving plants and green to provide shade. Placed      over cole crops, the cubes let in air and water but really      frustrate cabbage moths.    </p>    <p>      -Ronna M. Kelly<br />      Palo Alto, California    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pass the Seeds, Please</strong>    </p>    <p>      I use an old saltshaker to spread tiny seeds that are      difficult to distribute by hand.    </p>    <p>      -Dennis R. Willie<br />      Folsom, Louisiana    </p>    <p>      <strong>Succulence From the Swamp</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you have access to wetlands or a swampy area, go there      in the early spring to look for cattails. Cut off some of      the new shoots that are only one to three inches long.      Clean them till nothing but the solid ivory part remains.      Then cut them into small pieces and add a bit of salt and      your favorite salad dressing. My father told me about this      unusual salad, and I'll bet once you've savored its fine,      clean taste, you'll want to go back to gather more      cattails.    </p>    <p>      -Fred A. Race<br />      Euclid, Ohio    </p>    <p>      <strong>Broadloom Mulch</strong>    </p>    <p>      Carpeting is very effective for preventing weeds in the      garden. Old, used pieces can be found for free or purchased      for next to nothing. I look for carpet made of natural      fibers, then cut it into strips to run between rows and      into smaller pieces to position between plants. These can      be used for many years, don't blow away (like newspaper      does) and allow the rain to soak through. You can place      carpet over compost, if you wish, and over drip irrigation      systems, too. And it's great for those soggy spots where      you'd otherwise sink ankle-deep in mud.    </p>    <p>      -C athryn Marshall<br />      Atlin, British Columbia    </p>    <p>      <strong>No Strings Attached</strong>    </p>    <p>      Last spring, my neighbor (originally from Vietnam) watched      as I struggled to set up a string trellis for my peas. Then      he went over to a nearby pile of tree and bush trimmings      and came back with several branches, which he stuck firmly      in the ground next to the peas. My problems were over. The      peas climbed the thin limbs and thrived, and I was happy to      find a use for something I would have burned or thrown out.      This spring I plan to use branches to support all my vining      plants and my tomatoes as well.    </p>        <p>      -Todd Drake<br />      Greensboro, North Carolina    </p>    <p>      <strong>Waste Not, Want Not</strong>    </p>    <p>      I've found a way to recycle all those plastic bags that      manure, peat and other soil amendments come in. I cut the      bags crosswise into one-inch strips and use these for tying      up tomatoes and other plants that need support.    </p>    <p>      -Clarence Hoffman<br />      Nestor, California    </p>    <p>      <em>Through the years we've all discovered a few practical,      time-tested solutions to the frustrating little problems of      everyday life.
