                    <p>      The rate of species extinction may now be as high as one      per day.<br />    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Tom Turner    </h5>    <p>      June 17, 1987, is not a date most people will remember for      long. On that day, the last dusky seaside sparrow in the      world was found dead of old age in its cage in Florida. His      species had fallen victim to the space program, a      mosquito-abatement project, fire and Walt Disney World. It      is the latest species to be declared officially extinct. It      won't be the last.    </p>    <p>      There's nothing quite so final, so irrevocable, as      extinction. There's no appeal, no rematch, no instant      replay to see who should be penalized. And driving      thousands of species from the face of the earth is as big a      crime as we could possibly commit against the future.    </p>    <p>      Besides-and ultimately more important than-the      loss of directly exploitable economic benefits when a      species becomes extinct, the continuing smooth operation of      our planet is threatened. Biologists sometimes liken the      diversity of species on earth to the numerous rivets in a      piece of equipment. The dispersion of the load through the      rivets makes the machine flexible and durable; a few of the      rivets can be lost without disaster. Once a certain number      pop out, however, massive failure occurs. The diversity of      species in the earth's ecosystems provides this flexibility      and serves humans by stabilizing the climate, processing      wastes and returning nutrients, generating and maintaining      soils and controlling pests and diseases.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cataloguing the Morgue</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the 108 issues (and 18 years) since MOTHER began her      life, several thousand species have been extinguished      worldwide. The number is unknown and unknowable. Estimates      vary widely. Norman Myers, an Englishman who has spent his      life studying the wildlife in East Africa, estimates that      we may be losing a species a day at present. That rate      could increase to a species per hour by the year 2000.    </p>    <p>      We do know some facts about extinction rates, thanks to the      Endangered Species Act of 1973. That law set up an      elaborate system for listing various species worldwide as      endangered or threatened. Species are added to the list      after a review by officials in the Fish and Wildlife      Service's (FWS) Office of Endangered Species.    </p>    <p>      This is a fiercely political process, and greed often wins      out over biology. The presence of an endangered species can      halt any development that might threaten that species'      habitat, so there is incentive to prodevelopment types to      keep that list as short as possible. (During the first      three years of the Reagan administration, for example, only      two species were added to the lists, despite near-unanimous      agreement that there are thousands of as yet unlisted      species in need of protection.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, it's often impossible to determine precisely      when a listed species finally does vanish: One cannot prove      a negative. A species is removed from the endangered list      only when there is scientific consensus that the species is      gone.    </p>    <p>      On rare occasions, there is good news, as when on May 5,      1986, ornithologists announced that they had positively      identified two ivory-billed woodpeckers in Cuba-birds      that had been feared extinct for two decades.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Official Body Count</strong>    </p>    <p>      Only five species have been declared officially extinct and      removed from the endangered species list since it was begun      in 1973: the Tecopa pupfish (1982), the longjaw cisco (a      Great Lakes fish, 1983), the blue pike (1983), the Santa      Barbara song sparrow (1983) and the dusky seaside sparrow.      During the same period, three were taken off the list for      the better reason: They had pulled back from the brink of      extinction. These were all birds that live on Belau      (formerly spelled Palau) in the western Pacific.    </p>    <p>      The Fish and Wildlife Service's international list of      endangered and threatened animals, fish, amphibians, birds      and insects now numbers around a thousand. (There are at      least 200 endangered plants in the United States alone;      data aren't good for the rest of the world.) Many of them      are teetering on the brink of extinction, and a variety of      government agencies and citizen groups are working to      rescue them before it's too late.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What Now?</strong>    </p>    <p>      The extinction of species, as those who help the process      along like to remind us, is a natural phenomenon: "The      dinosaurs passed from the earth without meddling by humans,      didn't they?" Yes, but the point is irrelevant. Extinction      is now happening at an unprecedented rate, and it's      accelerating. There are economic and medical reasons to      stem the tide-as well as the ecological and moral      ones. We can do it, but not unless we increase our efforts      enormously-and do so quickly.    </p>    <p>      Tom Turner is staff writer for the Sierra Club Legal      Defense Fund in San Francisco.    </p>        <p>      California condor <em>Gymnogyps californianus</em> The last      wild California condor was taken into captivity on Easter      Sunday 1987, officials having determined that the      wilderness was a threat to the species' survival. As is the      case with many species that have already disappeared,      thecondor was once common, ranging from Canada to Mexico      and from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific. It has been      poisoned, shot, and had its lands systematically      appropriated by hu mans for their purposes. Faced with a      population of condors that has plummeted from thousands a      century ago to around 30 a decade ago, the FWS and the      National Audubon Society embarked on a "condor recovery      program" that aimed to restore the species by taking eggs,      young birds and adults from the wild and rearing them in      captivity. After 20 years, perhaps, the birds will be      returned to the wild. <em>Estimated population: 0 wild, 28      in two zoos.</em>    </p>        <p>      Palila <em>Loxioides bailleui</em> This Hawaiian      honeycreeper (all native Hawaiian birds are legally      endangered) is threatened by competition for food and      shelter from feral sheep and goats that have been moved      into its only range: the upper slopes of Mauna Kea on the      island of Hawaii. Some years ago, the Sierra Club Legal      Defense Fund brought a suit with palila itself as the lead      plaintiff-the first time a court had allowed such a      case to be prosecuted. The palila prevailed, and the court      ordered the government of Hawaii to remove one of the      species of goats from the birds' habitat. Now the Legal      Defense Fund is back in court to seek removal of another      species of goat in palila country. <em>Estimated      population: 2,000.</em>    </p>        <p>      Black-footed ferret<br />      <em>Mustela nigripes<br /></em> This weasel was thought      extinct until 1984, when a colony was discovered in      Wyoming. Black-footed ferrets live exclusively with prairie      dogs, their principal food. The ferrets have been nearly      exterminated by poisons aimed at the prairie dogs, by      epidemics of dog distemper, and by a renegade virus that      struck them recently. The ferrets' lot, though still      tenuous, may be improving. Captive breeding experiments      have finally yielded survivors, and there have been      confirmed sightings in the wild. <em>Estimated population:      35-40.</em>    </p>                    <p>      <strong>Sciota mad tom</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Noturus trautmani</em> This small catfish from the Ohio      River may already be extinct. It was last seen in 1958 or      '59, though it was very difficult to find. This is a good      illustration of how the FWS is loath to actually declare a      species extinct. The regulations on this point read as      follows:<br />      <br />      "Extinction: Unless all individuals of the listed species      had been previously identified and located, and were later      found to be extirpated from their previous range, a      sufficient period of time must be allowed before delisting      to indicate clearly that the species is extinct."      <em>Estimated population: Unknown.</em>    </p>        <p>      Perdido Key beach moose    </p>    <p>      <em>Peromyscus polionotus trissyllepsis</em> This species      was discovered during studies of the environmental impact      of building condominium on Perdido Key off the coast of      Alabama. Biologists counted the little rascals, determined      that their population stood at around two dozen, and      immediately had the mouse added to the endangered species      list. Construction of the condos is currently under      court-ordered injunction pending the outcome of a lawsuit.      <em>Estimated population: 24.</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Bowhead whale</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Balaena mysticetus</em> Driven to the edge of      extinction in the last century by Yankee whalers, the      bowhead is now hunted only by Inupiat Eskimos in Alaska.      While it's still in peril, it provides an interesting      example of the hubris of Western science. In 1977,      responding to scientific estimates that the population had      plunged to between 800 and 1,200 whales, the International      Whaling Commission voted to ban all hunting of bowheads,      whether for commercial or subsistence purposes. The Eskimos      reacted sharply, saying that there were far more than 1,200      bowheads still alive, and that native people weren't stupid      enough to kill the last remnant of a species vitally      important to their survival. The Eskimos were permitted to      hunt, and as of 1986, owing entirely to enhanced counting      capability, the total population of towheads is now      considered to be in excess of 7,000. <em>Estimated      population: 7,000.</em>    </p>
