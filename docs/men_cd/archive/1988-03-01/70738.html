                        <p><strong>      There are lots of ways to nurture those tender spring      seedlings.</strong></p>			<h5 id="byline">      By Susan Sides    </h5>    <p>      My first seed-starting container was a cutoff milk carton      I'd saved from the school cafeteria. It made a fine and      frugal little plant nursery. Of course, milk cartons still      work, but today's home gardener can also choose from a      confusing array of commercial seed-starting systems. What      about these setups-are they gimmicks or godsends? How      much do they cost, how long do they last, and how well do      they work? To find answers to these questions, I put eight      different seed-starting setups through three trial      plantings. To begin, I planted a selection of vegetables      and flowers, including lettuce, tomatoes, broccoli, celery,      squash, marigolds, sweet Williams and zinnias. In later      tests, I grew only kale from the same seed batch, so I      could better compare seedling sizes.    </p>    <p>      All but one of the systems produced fine seedlings, but      there were considerable differences in how each system      worked and how easy it was to use. I comment on those      differences and share my own personal preferences here.      Still, different gardeners have different needs and      opinions. Each of the eight seed-starting systems has      supporters who prefer using it and who get good results.    </p>    <p>      So take my opinions with a grain of gardener's salt, and      make your own choices. Most important, consider the needs      of the plants you're starting. Change places with them on      the windowsill for a moment, and make sure to properly use      whatever system you choose:    </p>    <p>      Use a good soil mix. (A good homemade recipe is five parts      shredded leaf mold or compost, five parts good fine topsoil      and two parts of sharp sand. Adjust it if your soil is      unusually heavy or light.) Keep the soil constantly moist      until the seedlings germinate. Water thereafter whenever      the top half-inch of soil gets dry. And frequently use a      diluted fish emulsion or fish and kelp mix, especially if      the seedlings are growing in a sterile soil medium. Provide      adequate light. Windowsill seedlings will grow more slowly      than those raised under artificial light. Fluorescent tubes      work better than incandescent bulbs (they don't roast the      plants) but need to be set up quite close to the starts and      raised as the plants grow. The more tubes the better. Keep      seedlings warm. If you can provide bottom heat to the soil,      the plants will do fine with cooler air temperatures.      Indeed, up to a point, plants double their growth rate for      every 10Â°F rise in soil temperature.    </p>    <p>      Follow such steps and your seedlings won't end up longing      for the great outdoors just so they can escape their seed      starters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother Tests The Seed Starters</strong><br />      A close look at eight home gardening setups    </p>        <h3>      Peat Pot    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Description:</strong> Individual square or round      pots made of pressed peat moss and plant nutrients. A      popular brand called Jiffy Pots can be bought in connected      groups of 12, called Jiffy Strips. They are used with      standard plastic flats or specially sized Jiffy Set      flats.<br />      <br />      <strong>Durability:</strong> One-time use. Peat pots are      meant to break down in the soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ease of use:</strong> These plant-it-all containers      have been popular with home gardeners for a good while, but      I noticed a few potential drawbacks. Round pots seem a      waste of space when compared to square ones. Individual      pots are a pain to keep standing when you're filling them      (sets are easier). And the peat walls tend to wick water      away from the soil. Granted, this does promote good      drainage and root aeration, but the extra waterings thus      required promote algae growth, as well. You also need to      tear peat pots when transplanting (they don't always break      down readily), and you should bury them      completely-any edge left above the surface will wick      moisture away from the root zone.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Access:</strong> Local garden nurseries and many      seed and garden supply catalogues, including Park Seeds      (Cokesbury Rd., Greenwood, SC 29647). Eight Jiffy Strips (a      total of 96 pots) cost $5.95 plus $1 shipping and      handling.<br />      <br />      <strong>Rating:</strong> * * Peat pots require too much      watering and can be inconvenient to use.    </p>        <h3>      Soil Block Maker</h3><p>      <strong>Description:</strong> Spring-loaded metal devices      used to produce cubes of soil for individual seeds. The      plant cubes are then transplanted into the soil. Flats for      these soil cubes can be wooden (with three walls to allow      easy block removal), plastic or even the venerable      half-gallon milk carton (cut in half longways, each half      will hold exactly eight cubes).<br />      <strong>Durability:</strong> The block maker should last      indefinitely if well cared for. Individual soil blocks are      used only once.<br />      <strong>Ease of use:</strong> The key to success with block      makers is the soil mix you use. It must contain enough peat      moss to hold the cubes together without their becoming      adobe hard. Nick Woodin, a market gardener in New York, has      had success with a mixture of 50% peat moss, 50% compost      and some lime to adjust the pH.    </p>    <p>      Watering can also be a bit tricky. Since each cube stands      alone, the plants need to be watered frequently. Yet      overhead watering must be gentle to avoid eroding the      blocks, while watering from underneath, using capillary      moisture, will cause the bottoms of the blocks to become      mushy if too much moisture is present.    </p>    <p>      You can make as many or as few soil cubes as you need, and      the long-lasting tool pays for itself in one or two      seasons. But don't leave seedlings in soil blocks for much      more than four to six weeks, as they're too shallow to      support extended growth.<br />      <br />      <strong>Access:</strong> "Some garden supply centers, as      well as Gardener's Supply (128 Intervale Rd., Burlington,      VT 05401) for $14.75 plus $2.75 for shipping and      handling.<br />      <br />      <strong>Rating:</strong> * * I like the concept, but my      blocks don't stand up well to repeated waterings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wooden Flat</strong>    </p>        <p>      Description: Rectangular wooden container with slatted      bottom boards spaced 1/8 inch to 1/16 inch apart for      drainage. The standard depth is three inches for seedlings      that will stay in the starter for up to a month and six      inches for those that will remain from four to six weeks.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Durability:</strong> A flat will last many seasons      if properly cleaned and stored between uses.<br />      <br />      <strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Convenient to use. (But don't      make them too big or they'll get heavy. Good sizes are 14      by 23 inches for the three-inch-deep flats and 14 by 12      inches for the six-inch-deep containers.) Line the bottom      of each flat with whole leaves or newspaper. Fill it with      soil mix, and sow. For indoor use, you'll need a cookie      tray or something similar to catch the run-of from      watering. You may want to transplant seedlings started in a      shallow flat to a larger one as they grow (a process called      pricking out).    </p>    <p>      Transplanting, which requires lifting out sections of soil      and seedlings and gently sorting out individual plants,      isn't as easy as it is when using the other seven systems,      but the small amount of natural pruning that ensues      actually encourages lush root growth.<br />      <br />      <strong>Access:</strong> Homemade. You can build them for      free from scrap wood, or use purchased redwood or cedar      boards.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rating:</strong> * * * * My favorite seed-starter.      It's attractive, is a cinch to make at home out of natural,      recyclable materials and gives plant roots plenty of room      to grow.    </p>        <p>      Plastic Pack<br />      <strong>Description:</strong> One-piece, pocketed plastic      sheets. The common size has six cells to a pack (the more      cells per pack, the smaller each one will be), and eight of      these packs fit into one flat.    </p>    <p>      Extremely flimsy, yet made from nonrecyclable      materials.<br />      <br />      Convenient to use. The soil doesn't dry out too quickly in      between waterings, and transplants pop out with no damage      to the roots. One thing you must be watchful for is plants      becoming root-bound. This happens sometimes, especially      with smaller cell sizes, and can cause poor development or      premature bolting.<br />      <br />      Inexpensive packs cost around 50 cents a flat. W. Atlee      Burpee Company (Warminster, PA 18974) sells Deep Root      6-Packs, which are more durable than garden center packs. A      set of 10 6-Packs (for 60 seedlings in all) goes for $4.95      plus $1 shipping and handling.<br />      <br />      * Plastic packs work all right-I just can't stand the      environmental implications of such blatant throwaway      thinking.    </p>        <h3>      Accelerated Propagation System</h3>			<p><strong>Description:</strong> A very neat, compact system,      consisting of six parts: a bottom reservoir, a plastic      liner, a stand (that doubles as a pegboard for ease of      popping out seedlings at transplant time), a special      water-wicking mat, the actual growing tray and a clear,      plastic greenhouselike cover to keep in moisture and      warmth.<br />      <strong>Durability:</strong> Should last many      seasons.<br />      <strong>Ease of use:</strong> Easy to fill, plant and      transport. The reservoir holds almost a gallon of water,      and the capillary mat that hangs into it makes this water      available to the roots, which can draw from it as needed.      Therefore, the APS can be left alone for days at a time      once seedlings are growing well.<br />      The APS-40 has 40 one and one-halfinchsquare cells and is      recommended for lettuce, onions, leeks and celery, as well      as some herbs and flowers. The APS-24 has two dozen      two-inch-square cells and is recommended for plants needing      more growing room, like tomatoes, peppers, brassicas,      melons and corn.<br />      <strong>Access:</strong> Available from Gardener's Supply      (128 Intervale Rd., Burlington, VT 05401). Each unit costs      $7.95 plus $2.75 for shipping and handling; a set of three      units is $21.50 plus $4.95.<br />      <strong>Rating:</strong> * * * The APS is especially      convenient because it waters itself. Plants did so well I      had to take two weeks off recommended starting times.    </p>        <h3>      Speedling    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Description:</strong> Solid, one-piece, polystyrene      trays with pyramid-shaped cells. The square tops of these      cells funnel down to holes the diameter of a pencil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Durability:</strong> The one-piece unit will last      for 20 plantings or more. It is used repeatedly by many      commercial growers.<br />      <strong>Ease of use:</strong> Speedling cells are a breeze      to fill with soil. If you use the unit indoors, you need to      rig some kind of tray (such as an oversized cookie sheet)      to catch draining water. You may also want to prop the unit      up on small blocks to help "airprune" the roots. The thick      polystyrene walls insulate the soil pyramids, retaining      heat and moisture. This helps keep the soil from drying out      too quickly, which could mean death to tiny seedlings. The      stout young plants are a cinch to remove (just poke a      pencil eraser through the bottom holes) and      transplant.<br />      <strong>Access:</strong> Peaceful Valley Farm Supply (11173      Peaceful Valley Rd., Nevada City, CA 95959). The Model 200,      which has 72 cells, two inches square by three inches deep,      is a good all-around size. It costs $6 plus $2 for UPS      shipping ($4 shipping for multiples of four).<br />      <strong>Rating:</strong> * * * Easy to use, durable and      effective. Peaceful Valley states, "We've noticed 100076 to      300076 more roots with Speedlings than with other      systems."<br />    </p>        <h3>      Park Starts    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Descriptions:</strong> A compact polystyrene      seed-starting block with 18 cells. The block measures only      two and a half inches wide by six inches long by three      inches deep. The small (less then 3/a inch wide) planting      cells come prefilled with peat-based plugs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Durability:</strong> One-time use. Park-Starts are      not meant to be refilled.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>Ease of Use:</strong> There      is no making or adding soil mix with this system. You just      drop the seeds in, water with the provided soluble plant      food and keep in a lighted place. However, it can be hard      to get average or small seeds into the small but deep holes      in the plugs. Many that do not get into the holes will not      survive. On the other hand, some seeds that do get into the      holes rot while large seeds won't fit the holes at all.    </p>    <p>      Park-Starts are intended for short-term seedling growth, no      more than three or four weeks. This, however, doesn't allow      for the indoor jump on the season of from six to eight      weeks that most seed-starting gardeners are after.    </p>    <p>      The included tray provides a very small water reservoir, so      the soil plugs dry out very quickly. Often they needed      watering twice daily.<br />      <br />      <strong>Access:</strong> Available from Park Seeds      (Cokesbury Rd., Greenwood, SC 29647). Each pack contains      three units, will start 54 seedlings and sells for $5.95      plus $1 shipping and handling.<br />      <br />      <strong>Rating:</strong> * Inconvenient to use and      nonrecyclable. Worst of all, seedlings grown in ParkStarts      were consistently smaller than those grown with the other      systems.<br />      <br />    </p>        <h3>      PaperPots    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Description:</strong> Rings of biodegradable paper      joined in a honeycomb pattern with waterproof glue. These      rings come in three different sizes and packages include a      white plastic tray.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Durability:</strong> One-time use. The rings are      planted directly in the soil.<br />      <br />      <strong>Ease of Use:</strong> This system requires a bit of      care to fill. Each set of pots is shipped as a very thin,      flat rectangle. You stretch it open, accordion style, then      clip it to the edges of the plastic flat while you fill the      rings with soil. You have to make sure the pots are resting      on the bottoms of the flats, then aim the soil into the      pots, avoiding the oddshaped empty spaces that may occur      around the edges. (Or you can just fill the whole tray and      plant in the spaces as well.)    </p>    <p>      You need to tear the pots when transplanting in case they      don't break down quickly. PaperPots are good for staggered      plantings, since you can remove only a few seedlings at a      time. And the closeness of the pots to one another      conserves moisture and helps retain warmth.<br />      <br />      <strong>Access:</strong> The complete PaperPot system      includes three trays and 240 pots in a range of sizes for      $15.95 plus $3.75 shipping and handling from Gardener's      Supply (128 Intervale Rd., Burlington, VT 05401).<br />      <br />      <strong>Rating:</strong> * * The pots are nonreusuable and      a bother to set up and fill.<br />    </p>
