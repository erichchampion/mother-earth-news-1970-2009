            		   		 <p><strong>Brent Elswick on</strong></p>    		<p><strong> A roundup of the best new vegetable varieties for '88</strong></p>		    <p>      There are literally hundreds of new vegetable varieties on      the market this season, and-to save you both time and      potential disappointment-I've already tested many of      them in my garden. Here are some of my winners for 1988.      Addresses for the seed companies I mention can be found on      page 126.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lettuce</strong>    </p>    <p>      Though 1987's weather wasn't as bad as that of '86, an      unusual 18-inch April snowfall here in the Appalachian      Mountains, followed by several rainless weeks, didn't      exactly provide optimum growing conditions for early,      cool-weather crops. Even so, some of my trials thrived. For      example, Lollo Biondo from Le Marche Seeds proved to be a      sensational new looseleaf lettuce. Maturing in around 55      days, it's akin to last year's highly recommended Lollo      Rosso, and its bright, frilly, yellow-green leaves, tinged      with red, are as prettyto look at as they are tender and      tasty.    </p>    <p>      Biondo a Foglie Lisce (don't try to pronounce it, just grow      it) is another wonderful leaf lettuce, from The Cook's      Garden. Its smooth, pale green leaves can be picked as      early as a month after seeding.    </p>        <p>      This year, Shepherd's Garden Seeds has one of the best      Batavian-type lettuces-so esteemed by the      French-that I've ever grown. Called Antina, its      pretty, medium-green leaves edged with red are juicy yet      crunchy. Left to grow to maturity, they form crisp      rosettes; immature leaves can serve as a most acceptable      loose-leaf lettuce. Antina stands up well to warm weather.    </p>    <p>      There are three fine new butterhead types on the market.      Cobham Green, introduced by Bountiful Gardens, matures in      65 days and stands up to heat well. Musette, a similar      variety from Garden Import, matures at the same time and      has large, medium-green hearts that remain in good eating      condition longer than those of most lettuces on the market.      Musette is also resistant to lettuce virus. Fisher's Garden      Store specializes in early maturing and midget types, and I      especially like its Green Mignonette; the small heads are      extremely crisp and tender.    </p>    <p>      The most unusual crisphead lettuce I've found is The Cook's      Garden's superb La Brillante, which combines the shiny leaf      of a crisphead with the unmatched tenderness of a fine      butterhead. And though Stokes' South Bay is fairly late to      mature, the taste of its deeply cut, dark green foliage is      worth the wait. It can also claim the best disease      resistance of any crisphead I've grown.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Spinach and Other Greens</strong>    </p>    <p>      Popeye would be powerfully tempted to try gardening this      year, because some of the new spinach varieties are      exceptional. Mazurka-a bolt-resistant 45-day hybrid      from Territorial Seed Company-has large, smooth, very      dark green leaves that are mild and slightly sweet. They're      delicious either cooked or served raw in salads. Shepherd's      offers a smooth-leaved Dutch type called Nordic that is      fairly heat-tolerant. Italian Summer, also from Shepherd's,      is a crinkled savoy leaf that's wonderful for freezing.      This heat-resistant newcomer is especially good for      late-summer plantings. Basella Malabar Red Stem, produced      by Park Seeds, is a good spinach substitute and a great      improvement on the old Malabar types. It can be trained to      grow to a height of six feet or more, and-raw or      cooked-its thick, dark green leaves and red stems are      mild and delicious.    </p>    <p>      If Japanese-type greens are to your liking, Territorial has      a worthy new hybrid called Tokyo Beau. This mizuna variety      has extraordinarily sweet leaves that are dark and shiny,      and its thick, white stalks make a good celery substitute.    </p>    <p>      The best new chard in my trials was the Vintage Green      hybrid from Gaze Seed Company. Its green leaves with      whiteribbed stalks grow in absolute abundance month after      month. Erbette Leaf Beet, from The Cook's Garden, is used      like chard and is a great cut-and-come-again variety. When      cooked, it's nearly impossible to distinguish from spinach.    </p>    <p>      A few years ago, Twilley Seeds introduced a greatly      improved Vates-type kale, Blue Knight, that is one of the      best hybrid kales on the market. The firm's new Blue      Armour, though, is probably even more prolific. It also      seems to be the most suitable of all varieties to      winter-over-a definite plus for those wanting greens      extremely early in the spring.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Radishes</strong>    </p>    <p>      Shepherd's Roodbol (Dutch for "Redball") is an extra-fancy,      ball-shaped radish that won't get woody with size and can      be harvested in little more than three weeks. Though      similar to Roodbol in many ways, lovely Marabelle from      Johnny's Selected Seeds won't take heat as well, but it      does grow with an amazing uniformity that's perfect for      those wanting a red variety for successive crops.      Territorial offers Scarlet Globe (Ribella), one of the more      refined Cherry Belle types. Though maturing a few days      after Roodbol and Marabelle, it rapidly obtains a large      size and resists pithiness.    </p>    <p>      Stokes Seeds offers two odd new varieties. Its round-shaped      Valentine is green and white on the outside, and the inside      turns red at maturity. Though strange-looking, this radish      is tasty and easy to grow. And Stokes' Martian, shaped like      the old French Breakfast-variety, has a long root that's      green, not red, at the top. I like the way it looks (and      tastes) in salads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Peas</strong>    </p>    <p>      While most better-known English peas mature about      midseason, William Dam Seeds offers Frostiroy that's ready      in 55 days and is resistant to fusarium wilt and yellows.      The two-and-a-half-foot vines produce a big harvest of      tiny, very sweet peas.    </p>    <p>      Among the midseason types, disease-resistant Aurora from Ed      Hume Seeds has fairly short pods brimming with large sweet      peas that mature about a week later than Hume's Olympia      (which I heartily praised last year). Other fine midseason      peas include Tillinghast's Icer No. 93, a greatly improved      type of Dwarf Telephone from Tillinghast Seeds, and Freezer      69 from Early Seed & Feed Ltd. Both have strong,      sturdy, short vines that produce heavy yields that freeze      well.    </p>    <p>      Park offers two fine new edible-podded peas for '88.      Blizzard lives up to its name by producing a literal      snowstorm of tasty snow peas on tidy 30-inch plants early      in the season. The company's new dwarf snap pea called      Sugar Pop has space-saving 18-inch plants loaded with      three-inch, sweet, stringless pods. It's disease-resistant      as well.    </p>    <p>      Rogers Brothers' Honey Pod is a real taste sensation. (T      & T Seeds lists this variety.) Growing on sturdy,      compact vines, its nearly stringless, three-and-a-half- to      four-inch pods have a honey-sweet flavor which will make      them salad favorites.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Onions and Potatoes</strong>    </p>    <p>      Neither of the two top scallions in my trials is      traditional in color. Johnny's Purplette, which is pastel      pink when cooked or pickled, is considered a minionion,      but-if picked early-it also serves as a most      delightful bunching onion. Shepherd's Red Beard is a      scallion that can also double as a mini-onion if left to      mature. The red color in the stem develops better in cool      weather, so plant this variety so it can be harvested in      the fall. Both of these unusual alliums are ready in about      60 days.    </p>    <p>      Rarely do you find a sweet Spanish onion that produces a      very large bulb yet has the storing capability of the more      pungent types, but Fiesta 61 is just such a rarity. This      new wonder from Liberty Seed Company also matures almost      two weeks earlier than most Spanish varieties.    </p>    <p>      If you want a lot of onions to store, Bountiful's James      Long Keeping produces small-to medium-size bulbs that are      some of the most remarkable keepers ever developed.    </p>    <p>      Leeks are becoming increasingly popular, and both Le Marche      and The Cook's Garden sell the lovely, tasty and very, very      firm Blue Solaise that turns almost purple after an autumn      cold spell. No variety is better to leave in the garden for      winter harvests.    </p>    <p>      This year, the most outstanding potatoes are      yellow-fleshed. Both Tillinghast and Seeds Blum offer      Yellow Finn. This excellent all-purpose potato is      especially good for baking or boiling. Though not large in      size, it's a good producer.    </p>    <p>      Becker's Seed Potatoes has several good varieties. Yukon      Gold is the firm's biggest seller and my personal favorite,      because it combines super-culinary and good-storage      qualities. Becker's Pink Pearl has long tubers with      entirely pink skin. This good-eating potato is      disease-resistant, too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Turnips, Rutabagas and Beets</strong>    </p>    <p>      New turnips are scarce this year, but DeGiorgi Company is      proud of a unique variety called All Seasons that will be      ready to eat in 28 days. The white-skinned, white-fleshed      roots stay sweet much longer in hot dry weather than do      those of most varieties.    </p>    <p>      Among rutabagas, the best I've grown is Stokes' very      mild-flavored Altasweet. It's a special cross between the      well-known Macomber and Laurentian varieties. Its deep      yellow flesh is somewhat sweet, and Altasweet keeps well.    </p>    <p>      While my trials included quite a few odd-shaped and      odd-colored beets, most of the outstanding newcomers are      more traditional. Le Marche's Boldet is a full-flavored      British canning variety that grows vigorously and keeps      well in the field. Big Red, a new hybrid from Porter &      Son Seedsmen, is excellent for canning, pickling and using      fresh.    </p>    <p>      One winner that doesn't fit the normal beet mold is      Macgregor's Favorite from The Cook's Garden. It has long,      dark, carrot-shaped roots with a rich beet taste, and      narrow, spear-shaped leaves that are a deep, metallic      purple. In fact, the foliage is so lovely I'd like to      include it in my flower border.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Carrots and Parsnips</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are so many outstanding new carrots this year that I      can only touch on a few. Crunchy Hybrid from D. V. Burrell      is one of the very best-and      bolt-resistant-Imperator types ever. Its nine-inch,      blunt-tipped roots live up to the crunch in their name.      Pinetree Garden Seeds offers Berlicummer, a long nantes      type that's first-rate in all respects, including flavor      and color. Territorial's Tamino, a very fine nantes hybrid,      is especially noteworthy because it can be left in the      ground nearly all winter without losing its quality.    </p>    <p>      Midget vegetables have become all the rage lately, and      Liberty's Minicore produces three- to four-inch roots that      are extra sweet and flavorful. Another fine small carrot is      Johnny's Parmex. Its round root matures so early it's often      ready to harvest with peas. Unlike other round carrots,      Parmex develops a sweet flavor and bright orange color even      when immature.    </p>    <p>      No one knows parsnips like the English, and Johnny's offers      Cobham Improved Marrow, developed by England's leading      parsnip breeder. This half-long type has an incredibly high      sugar content. Another fine-flavored parsnip, Tender &      True, is reputed to be the longest variety. Offered by      Thompson & Morgan, it's certainly large, as parsnips      go, and it doesn't have the usual hard core: On the other      end of the spectrum, McFayden's Short Thick is one of the      shortest varieties, and its quality is excellent. It's      early to mature but will keep in the ground well into      winter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cole Crops</strong>    </p>    <p>      Among new cabbages, Charmant from Twilley is the best early      variety I've seen in a while. It's attractive in      appearance, very vigorous and disease-resistant. A      Stonehead type, Charmant is ready for harvest in a little      more than 50 days.    </p>    <p>      To bridge the gap between the early and the larger      midseason varieties, try Johnny's Perfect Action. Its fine      appearance, excellent flavor, and split- and      yellows-resistance make it a winner, while Burrell's      eight-pound Ocala is one of the better late-season hybrids      (110 days) and is ideal for kraut.    </p>    <p>      Among savoys, Bountiful's Best of All is very early, and      has extra-large, solid heads that withstand cold. Drumhead      Savoy from Allen, Sterling & Lothrop, which matures a      little later, has a delightful interior quality. It's very      firm, well-blanched and crisp, yet tender.    </p>    <p>      Shepherd's offers one of the better new red cabbages. Its      Scarlet O'Hara is a Japanese introduction, whose      three-pound heads are a brilliant burgundy-red color with a      crunchy, mild taste. It matures in about 72 days. Park has      a very fine new Chinese cabbage called Green Rocket. This      hybrid is a Michihili type that's sweet, crisp and      tender-perfect, either for salads or Oriental recipes.    </p>    <p>      Packman, from S & B Seed Sales, is the top broccoli      variety in my trials. The heads on this new hybrid are      quite large for an early type, and it has excellent      side-shoot development. For warmer areas, try      drought-resistant Green Valiant from Midwest Seed Growers.      Finally, Shepherd's offers Violet Queen, a hybrid version      of the old favorite, purple broccoli. While the leaves look      like a cauliflower's, the deeply tinted, purple florets      (which turn bright green when cooked) have a very mild      taste. The plant matures earlier and is much more compact      than the old purple types.    </p>    <p>      If an early cauliflower suits your needs, try Early Glacier      from Vesey's Seeds. The quality of this hybrid is      outstanding and the curd size is quite large. Midwest's      Candid Charm matures slightly later but can be harvested      for up to three weeks after that.    </p>    <p>      Dolmic, a European introduction from Stokes, is my choice      of the new Brussels sprouts. It takes over 100 days to      mature, but that's still fairly early for one of these      vegetables. The plants offer very high yields of small,      oval, excellent-tasting sprouts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Celery</strong>    </p>    <p>      While celery isn't one of the more commonly grown      vegetables in the home garden, recent varieties now make it      much easier to grow. Garden Import offers Ivory Tower, a      new 90-day self-blanching type. The plants are quite tall      with fleshy, smooth, white stems. Should you want to try a      traditional green celery, Twilley's Green Giant, a very      fancy variety, has a fine flavor and uniform plants that      mature in 115 days.    </p>    <p>      If you're looking for a celery substitute, celeriac      warrants a trial. Alabaster from Burpee Seeds is a superb      variety, whose celery flavored roots are great eaten raw,      used in soups or grated for slaw or salads. Maturing in 120      days, Alabaster is a very good keeper.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Corn</strong>    </p>    <p>      The early corn that tops my list isn't one of the modern      superhybrids but a variation of the old Golden Bantam. It's      Montana Bantam from Fisher's, and it performed extremely      well in our terrible spring last year. Maturing in 65 days,      its Bantamlike ears are very slender and loaded with deep      golden kernels of delicious flavor and quality.    </p>    <p>      Of the more modern types, one of the best corns for      tolerating cold soil is Northernvee from McFayden Seeds.      Its eating quality may be a tad below that of the Bantams,      but it's quite satisfactory, and no variety will tolerate      poor growing conditions better.    </p>    <p>      I've always been fond of Golden Beauty types, and T &      T's Sweet Beauty surpasses its parents. It will mature in      about 70 days and can be counted on for perfectly shaped      seven- to eight-inch ears that taste fantastic.    </p>    <p>      For a midseason yellow variety, I recommend S & B's      Royal Gold, an old-fashioned corn that's ready to eat in      about 85 days. Its sturdy eight-foot stalks will each bear      two ears of bright, golden yellow kernels that are tender      and sweet. As an added bonus, Royal Gold is less      susceptible than most corn to attacks from birds and      earworms.    </p>    <p>      Despite its lackluster name, I can't say enough good things      about midseason AVX 2539 from Burrell. This Sweet Gene      hybrid has pale yellow kernels that are tender and filled      with flavor. It freezes well, too. I also like Mevak, the      Asgrow midseason corn offered by Vesey's, because the short      shank allows for easy picking (which isn't true of a lot of      the new supersweets), and its good ear cover also fights      off birds and insects.    </p>    <p>      Stokes' Tri-Sweet is the best very early maturing (65 days)      bicolor I've grown, and unlike other earlier varieties, it      offers windtolerance, plus ears that are lovely to look at      and great to eat.    </p>    <p>      Liberty has long been involved in developing new sweet corn      varieties-especially SE and SH types. Their new      bicolor SE is the 68-day Bodacious, a name that signifies      something extraordinarily good, and this corn, which has an      old-fashioned creamy texture, is just that!    </p>    <p>      Ferry-Morse's best new variety is called Cornfetti. This      85-day standard type has super eye appeal and excellent      flavor. Letherman's is one of the few sources to date for      this excellent bicolor.    </p>    <p>      As with the early yellows, an older, open-pollinated      variety, Early Pearl from Good Seed is my pick among      today's white corns. It was once one of the most popular      offerings of the venerable firm, Charles C. Hart Seed, but      now, sadly, has been almost forgotten. While not as early      as the early Bantams, I did eat my first delicious ears      after about 75 days. And, like all open-pollinated      varieties, its harvest is extended because all the ears      don't ripen at once. Be sure to try this "new-old" variety.    </p>    <p>      Another fine white is White Satin from The Meyer Seed      Company. Maturing in 73 days, it has excellent      cold-tolerance, tight husks for bird protection, and sweet      and tender kernels bursting with flavor. Twilley's new      white this year is Summer Flavor 80W, which has the      distinctive supersweet taste of the SH types but retains a      creamy texture. Better yet, it will hold its flavor on the      stalk or in the fridge for days after maturity.    </p>    <p>      Those who like the sweet crunch of the SH types should try      Stokes' Bunkerhill. The s turdy plant is disease-resistant,      and the ears snap off much easier than do those of most SH      types. Phenomenal is a bicolor SH from Stokes that's very      sweet. Good tip coverage is a big bonus, since birds and      bugs seem to like supersweets as much as some people do.      This 85-day hybrid is definitely the leading SH bicolor of      the season.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Beans</strong>    </p>    <p>      No eastern Kentucky garden (like mine) would be complete      without White Half Runners, and I've always found Hastings      to be among the best sources of these. The firm lists two      varieties of Half Runners: State and Mountaineer. While      State is more disease-resistant, Mountaineer offers better      quality.    </p>    <p>      Leading the list of new bush beans is Harvester Teepee from      Pinetree. It differs from the old Harvester variety in that      the delicious, slender pods grow high up on the vine,      making for cleaner beans and easier picking. Fifty days      after planting, you can begin a long harvest of these      delicious legumes.    </p>    <p>      Of all the new beans I grew, Ballack from Seeds Blum was      the best. It has dark seeds (a drawback for canning), but      it's as sweet and tender as any bean I've eaten, with the      exception of the Half Runner. The final bush bean of note      is Ajax Broad Stringless, one of the flat European slicing      types from William Dam. Not commonly found in this country,      it's good fresh, but even better canned.    </p>    <p>      Shepherd's offers Serbo, a very fine new European pole      bean. The vines are literally covered with small pods that      are best eaten before they plump out. Northeaster from      Johnny's is the more usual pole type. At 55 days, it's one      of the fastest-maturing full-size poles, and its tender      eight-inch pods are stringless with a delicious, sweet      flavor.    </p>    <p>      Hastings has one of the oddest new poles in its Alabama      Pole No. 1. This cultivar's green pods have a purple cast      when ripe, and the seeds are black. The rather short, plump      pods mature fairly late, come in absolute droves and are      indeed delicious. Another strange pole bean is the Anellino      from Le Marche, in either green or yellow. The pods grow in      the shape of a hooked 0 with the bottom curving to meet the      top. The vines produce an abundant crop of these lovely      curlicues, which have a first-rate flavor.    </p>    <p>      Among the horticultural beans (we call them fall beans      around here), Allen, Sterling & Lothrop has one of the      best pole types. Their Worcester Horticultural has mammoth      pods that resemble the old fallor cranberry-type bean. The      heavy pods, splashed with red, are excellent when cooked.      When dried, they make a good pinto soup bean.    </p>    <p>      Of the half-dozen dry, or baking, beans I grew, Vesey's      Kenearly, an improved Yellow Eye cultivar, was among the      best performers. The most unusual was Johnny's excellent      French flageolet shell bean called Flambeau. The slender      pods have eight to 10 mint-green beans that are tender and      firm and will remind you of fresh limas.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cucumbers</strong>    </p>    <p>      Stokes' superb new Slice King is one of the finest      cucumbers I've ever grown-period. Though it has some      of the shiny gloss of the burpless variety that it is, it      looks more like a regular cuke. The attractive fruits are      eight to nine inches long, and mature in about 50 days.      Though you'll grow Slice King for its taste, it's also      enormously productive and disease-resistant.    </p>    <p>      Among pickling cukes, I especially liked Pik Master from      Seedway. The blocky, five-inch, white-spined fruits are      perfect for whole pickles. The vines are highly productive      and extremely disease-resistant. The cukes mature in about      53 days, a bit later than most picklers, but worth the      wait.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Watermelons and Cantaloupes</strong>    </p>    <p>      My favorite cantaloupe is Boule d'Or from Le Marche. In      certain areas of France, this melon is as famous as the      renowned Charentais. However, it's an entirely different      type of melon, requiring a long, warm growing season. (I      planted the middle of May and harvested the first of      September.) The large, round fruits are pale yellow, and      the light green interior is indescribably delicious.    </p>    <p>      The very best large watermelon I grew was the lovely Moon      & Stars from Seeds Blum. This variety derives its name      from the yellow moon- and star-shaped splashes on its dark      green skin. (The foliage is also speckled, making it      attractive to grow.) Inside this pretty exterior is one of      the best-eating melons you'll ever sink your teeth into.      The flesh is bright red and sugary sweet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Peppers</strong>    </p>    <p>      The most impressive sweet pepper among many was Pinetree's      Midal. The tall, rugged plants are loaded down with long,      cream-colored sweet fruits that turn an unusual orange-red      at maturity.    </p>    <p>      The hottest (literally) among the hot peppers I tried are      Habanero from Porter, Hot Apple from Stokes, and Sandia      from Burrell. All produce huge crops of fiery fruits that      will singe your tastebuds. Less hot, but still snappy, is      Hastings' Festival, whose fruits change from green to      orange to purple. Not only are the small, pointed peppers      pretty enough to allow this variety to double as an      ornamental plant, but their feisty flavor adds spice to any      number of dishes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Squash</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are some excellent new summer squashes, such as the      lovely Green Magic zucchini from Vesey's; Elini, a similar      variety from Twilley; and Butter Swan, a highly refined,      high-quality crookneck from Park.    </p>    <p>      Appealing winter squashes include the very early-maturing      (less than 90 days) Mountaineer from Fisher's. Its small,      slate blue, hubbard-type fruits are delicious baked, and      they keep well. I'm also really excited about Johnny's      Honey Delight, whose small, flattened globes are somewhat      like a buttercup variety without the button on the bottom.      No matter how you prepare them, their rich, orange flesh      will be flaky and sweet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tomatoes</strong>    </p>    <p>      Few tomatoes ripen earlier than Brookpack from Early Seeds.      In 55 days, you can pick bright red, flattened globes that      are surprisingly large (up to eight ounces) and quite      tasty. The vines are dwarf and compact, yet hold their      fruit off the ground.    </p>    <p>      Now let's move to the big tomatoes. Personally, I go for      the Better Boy types, but clones of the recent All America      Winner, Celebrity, are increasingly popular. Such a variety      is Summer Delight from Burpee. The eight- to 12-ounce      fruits, which mature in 75 days, are thick, meaty and      flavorful.    </p>    <p>      Among yellow tomatoes, I can recommend Vesey's Golden      Delight. The small plants are good producers of little      yellow fruits that are sweet and delicious. They are ready      in 60 days and make good companions to early reds. My other      favorite is Seeds Blum's delicious Persimmon. I've seen      more productive plants, and disease is a problem if no      preventive measures are taken. What makes it worth growing?      Sweet-flavored, meaty-textured fruits, with the lovely      color of ripe persimmons, that can reach a pound or more.    </p>    <p>      While I grew a lot of cherry tomatoes, the variety that      beat all the rest was Sweet Cherry Hybrid from Tomato      Growers Supply Company. It produces some of the sweetest,      best-tasting little fruits ever.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Creme de la Creme</strong>    </p>    <p>      As usual, I try to ask myself, of all the new varieties      I've tested, which ones would I pick if my garden space was      very limited. Here, to recap, are my very top'88 choices:    </p>    <p>      Crunchy carrot from Burrell, Bodacious bicolor sweet corn      from Liberty, Slice King cucumber from Stokes, Ballack      beans from Seeds Bhim, Boule d'Or cantaloupe from Le      Marche, Moon & Stars watermelon from Seeds Blum and      Summer Delight tomato from Burpee.    </p>    <p>      Gardening expert Brent Elswick has been testing new      varieties for <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> for over nine years.    </p>
