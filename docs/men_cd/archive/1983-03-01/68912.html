                <p>      <em>An old technology, spruced up with practical American      ingenuity, just might let us<br />      generate</em> ...    </p>        <p>      All of us are aware - when we top off our gas tanks      or pay the power and heat billsthat the cost of surviving      in modern society is taxing our incomes to a greater extent      than ever before. And since these energy costs, themselves,      reflect - to some extent, at least - the      economic hardships placed upon the suppliers of those      commodities, the expenses are ultimately distributed so      that <em>everyone</em> (manufacturers, food producers, and      consumers alike) is affected, in a vicious circle of      circumstance.    </p>    <p>      Cut-and-dried solutions to such a complicated problem can't      be expected, of course ... but one option-increased      decentralization of power generation-offers some real      advantages to folks who are willing to work with      alternatives on a personal or community level.    </p>    <p>      Specifically, we're referring to the generation of      electricity using corncobs ... the 36 million tons of waste      cores produced annually in just 10 of our corn-raising      states. This feedstock-when teamed with an old      technology that's now being updated, and perfectly good      municipal power generation equipment that <em>costs too      much</em> to use at present-might help to solve a      problem that plagues hundreds of rural communities across      the nation.    </p>    <h3>FOOTWORK PAYS OFF</h3>    <p>      About three years ago, Dr. James O'Toole of Iowa State      University began developing a concept that would allow      "local scale" power plants (those with a total generation      capacity of several thousand kilowatts or less) to utilize      agricultural by-products to fuel their natural      gas/diesel-powered generators. With the support of both      municipal power associations <em>and</em> two local      municipal utilities,, he conducted a survey of the diesel      generating capacity in the state of Iowa (77 plants were      evaluated for condition, adaptability, cost of      retrofitting, and acceptable environmental and safety      considerations) ... made a study of corncob availability      (based on the location of seed corn operations in 14      states, as well as on the storage capacity of Iowa's grain      elevators) ... and worked up an economic assessment of      corncob power production versus diesel electric generation.    </p>            <p>      During this same period, Robert Haug-a utility      analyst-formed a firm called Odin Associates, in order to      develop a small-scale demonstration of the existing      technology ... and late in 1981, after testing, his      organization received an Appropriate Technology grant from      the Department of Energy to further investigate the      possibility of using gasification equipment for the      generation of electricity on a community level.    </p>    <h3>SAME SONG, DIFFERENT VERSE</h3>    <p>      The technology necessary to make fuel from biomass dates      from the nineteenth century, and was further refined during      the Second World War ... when a shortage of petroleum      encouraged the use of charcoal in gasification systems.      Recently, there's been a renewed interest in wood-fueled      gasifiers (we've reported the progress of MOTHER's      researchers, among others, in past issues), and the      availability of modem materials and components-along      with a more complete understanding of how wood, rather than      charcoal, can function within such a system-has done      a lot to improve the performance of this type of equipment.    </p>    <p>      Odin Associates' goal, though, was to develop a working      generator that would use as many off-the-shelf components      as possible ... thus standardizing the construction of each      unit and-by minimizing expensive "custom tailored"      fabrications-keeping costs down.    </p>    <p>      The Odin units (two were developed, along with several      different fuel conditioning systems) are similar indesign      to those that utilize wood scraps as feedstock, with the      exception that some features were included and a couple      removed-to make the hardware compatible with corncob fuel.      For example, because the shelled ears are considerably less      dense than wood, and thus more porous (yet still offer a      heating value of 7,700 BTU per pound, equivalent to that of      the best oak), the moisture problem usually associated with      wood gasification is virtually nonexistent when corncobs      are used. Lumber scraps may be as much as one-third water      by weight . . . but cobs-even those stored in open      piles-retain only about 7 to 9% moisture, with 15%      being the "worst case" limit.    </p>    <p>      This means that the corn-burners can get by without [1]      double-walled fuel hoppers or internal condensate gutters,      [2] exotic-and often costly-in-line moisture      traps, or [3] prefeed fuel-drying bins ... and the      elimination of these extras reduces both the necessary      initial investment <em>and</em> the time that must be spent      on periodic maintenance.    </p>    <p>      And, in the process of developing the costeffective      gasifiers, Bob Haug and his associate, TorBjorn Haugen,      made some other discoveries worth mentioning. They      realized-from studying World War II-vintage      European hardware and accounts of its performance-that the      preheating of inlet air, and the even distribution and      regulation of that atmosphere through "tuyeres" (or      nozzles) within the combustion zone, had always been      considered of utmost importance. But because they felt that      they couldn't meet both criteria successfully, they opted      to eliminate the preheating hardware in order to give full      attention to combustion air distribution. The end result      was a 12-nozzle arrangement that utilized short,      valve-equipped pipes to deliver air-at ambient      temperature-directly to the hearth area. Then, to      enhance the overall burn pattern, they set up the tuyeres      at two levels, with a three-inch space between, and      staggered the alignment of the pipes in such a way that the      upper six are offset from the entrance points of the lower      six.    </p>    <p>      In effect, this not only reduces temperature variations      within the combustion chamber, but also <em>expands</em>      that zone to provide an increase in gas production without      enlarging the 16" hearth diameter. (The design has, after      100 hours of running time, shown no slag buildup, minimal      start-up times, and consist ent temperature levels, while      still being stonesimple. In all fairness, though, a      constantspeed powerplant, such as the type used with this      generator, places relatively few requisites upon a gasifier      ... because of the fact that gas demand doesn't ever      fluctuate with varying engine speeds.)    </p>    <p>      The hearth's size, configuration, and composition were      based upon the nature of the fuel and the cost of the      hearth. Although historical data indicated that a specific      hearth diameter was necessary to supply a given size of      engine, and that a restriction within the chamber was      desirable to maintain sufficient temperatures, Haug      successfully used a 16"-diameter straight steel pipe, and      merely installed a movable grate inside it to serve as a      shaker. Because there appeared to be no need to "funnel      down" the flow of gases, there was no reason to cast the      hearth into a special shape. Thus additional savings were      realized.    </p>    <p>      By the same token, it was decided-with an eye toward the      eventual commercialization of the technology-not to      try to upscale the unit to suit larger powerplants.      Instead, a modular approach-in which additional      <em>small</em> gasifiers could be added on line as      required-seemed more desirable from both a technical      standpoint (the single hearth for a 1,000-KW plant would      need to be a flow-choking <em>six</em> <em>feet</em> in      diameter), and a practical one (parts availability and      interchangeability would be a problem in gargantuan-scale      gasifiers).    </p>    <p>      Finally, in an effort to determine what the minimum      assembly costs might be, the Odin team experimented with a      variety of metal and PVC cooling mechanisms, wet and dry      filters, and simple moisture traps ... all of which would      serve to prepare the gaseous fuel prior to delivery to      their 35-KW diesel generator. The best results were      realized by using steel cooling towers housed in water      jackets ... installing flat-nipple, vacuum-operated diesel      truck water traps in the gas pipe ... and mounting a dry      cyclone filter-followed by a percolating oil-bath      chamber-in the line directly before the Detroit      diesel generator's air inlet.    </p>    <p>      Since the standby powerplant used in their research wasn't      equipped with a dual-fuel system, the Odin folks had to      make do by merely introducing fuel gas into the engine's      airstream. Unfortunately, the design of their particular      powerplant didn't lend itself a full range of pilot fuel      adjustment, so they, could only operate on a maximum of 80      corn gas. (Norwegian studies indicate that 24 little as 8%      diesel pilot fuel can be used when the injection is      properly adjusted, and that only a 20% sacrifice in output,      as compared to that when diesel fuel <em>alone is</em>      used, will occur under these conditions.)    </p>    <h3>IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS</h3>    <p>      From a technical standpoint, then, the concept of using      corn by-products for fuel is a viable one. But the      implications of this concept could go far beyond simply      providing, power for a farm or community.    </p>    <p>      To begin with, there are a variety of other ways in which      the agriculturally derived gas can be put to use. Although      relying on the equipment to provide base-load      (minimum-generation) capacity at a municipal plant is      entirely feasible (in this case, total cost per      kilowatt-hour-taking capital, labor, maintenance,      insurance, and fuel expenses, with cobs at $15 per ton,      into account-would work out to 35 cents ... when      produced by a fully amortized 1,000-KW generator derated to      800KW capacity), a more likely situation would be one in      which a gasifier system is installed to fuel an      <em>existing</em> local generator during periods when the      larger regional public utility experiences high demand      levels.    </p>    <p>      In this case, costs per KWH would be about one-third higher      (simply because fewer KWH would be produced), but the real      savings-which affect the ultimate "bottom      line"-would relate to demand costs. Typically, this      would work as follows: Let's assume a small municipal      utility has a total generating capacity of 2,400 KW. By      maintaining its equipment in working condition, such a      local utility might receive a monthly demand credit of      $3.00 per KW from its wholesale supplier, a large privately      owned utility. (Because the municipality can't really      afford to use its diesel-driven equipment, with <em>fuel      costs alone</em> at over 10 cents per KWH, it relies on the      big utility to provide power ... but that supplier, in      turn, keeps the <em>potential</em> of the small utility in      reserve-and guarantees its availability by requiring      regular exercise runs-to avoid having to build extra      capacity into its <em>own</em> generating stations to cover      the demand peaks which occur seasonally at irregular      intervals.)    </p>    <p>      In our example, we'll say that the wholesale contract      requires the municipal utility to pay a demand charge of $      6.00 per KW, plus the normal fee for power. This demand      charge typically applies to 85% of any new 15-minute peak      for a period of six months... or until a greater peak is      reached. So if, say, the small utility reaches a      quarter-hour-long peak that's 100 KW <em>above</em> its      previous highest demand level (as a result of an unusually      hot summer day or the unplanned use of a grain elevator),      it pays a demand charge, for that month, of 100 X $6.00, or      $600. Then, for each of the next five months, it must pay      85% of that established peak, which amounts to $2,550. In      short, that single 15-minute power draw cost the community      a total of $3,150.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, by generating its <em>own</em> power during peak      demand periods, using crop wastes, the municipal utility      illustrated in this instance could maintain a      <em>consistent</em> level of purchased power and save money      ... even when the locally produced energy is somewhat      expensive on a per-kilowatt basis. This practice, in fact,      would virtually bring back on line the hundreds of      small-scale, decentralized power-production centers      indigenous to rural communities, and allow us to rely less      on the massive, vulnerable (and often nuclearpowered)      generating plants now in use.    </p>    <p>      In addition to fueling municipal utilities in several ways,      corncob gasification has a place in farming, manufacturing,      and even individual applications . . . where production of      power and heat for varying periods would be desirable.      And-under the regulations specified in Section 210 of      the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978-it      may be feasible for such independent producers to sell      their excess power to local utilities.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, it's possible to use the manufactured fuel in      closecoupled combustion ... in which case it could replace      natural gas for such tasks as grain drying or space      heating. In this mode, at about a 90% gasifier efficiency      (as opposed to 80% when the equipment is used in      conjunction with a diesel engine), corn gas      costs-based on a cob price of $15 per ton-work      out to just over $1.00 per million BTU ... in comparison      with natural gas expenses of approximately $5.00 for the      same measure. (Capital costs roughly figure to about $2,000      per million BTU of capacity, or $3,500 for one 16"      gasification unit.)    </p>    <p>      Above and beyond these financial considerations, the      widespread use of simple gasification equipment could have      a number of social and economic benefits. The fuel is a      renewable and (apparently) environmentally sound      agricultural by-product that demands little in the way of      preparation or storage, and it's perfectly suited to local      utilization.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps equally important, the development of this process      would offer a supplemental market to corn growers (who now      have to sell their crop at below-production-cost prices).      The sale of cobs at $15 to $25 per ton would enhance the      corn's total market value by 11 cents to 17 cents per      bushel. Over the long term, the practice would also      conserve fuel reserves by creating financial incentives to      pick and shell, rather than combine, the corn. (Besides the      fact that combining equipment costs considerably more than      traditional cornharvesting implements-and also      physically renders the cobs useless for gasifier      fuel-the delayed shelling of the crop would allow it      to cure on the cob, thus reducing energy requirements for      drying.)    </p>    <h3>COBS HELP THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES</h3>    <p>      It would truly be a shame to keep this homegrown technology      under a bushel, so to speak. The fact that the equipment      could easily be fabricated on a local <em>level</em>      - <em>and that</em> installed gasifier and      fuel-handling costs, at between $30 and $35 per kilowatt of      capacity, are four to ten times lower than those usually      reported in the fledgling gasification      industry-should make the options clear. Whether the      knowledge is taken advantage of is simply up to the doers      among us.    </p>
