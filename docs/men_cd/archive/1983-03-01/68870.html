                <p>      <em>And here's yet another "make it in mere minutes"      flier!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by G.R. Osborne    </h5>    <p>      <em>In hardly any time, and with a little help from your      feathered friends, you can make a lightweight kite ... one      that may not</em> fly high, <em>but</em> will fly      <em>very</em> <em>well. This tiny toy is attractive, but      it's also quite simple to assemble ... since the body is      plastic foam, and each wing is a feather.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Start by cutting a polystyrene foam ball</em> <em>in      half, and then</em> <em>carving one section into the shape      of a bird's body (you can follow the design in the drawing      or make your own, as long as it's symmetrical).</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>Next, stroll on out to the chicken coop (or duck pond)      and gather some feathers. You'll need three or more tail      plumes-all straight, none too long-and two fairly large      wing feathers ... get one from a left and one from a right      wing, though (they'll curve in opposite directions), or      your kite will be a whirly bird!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Now, insert the wing feathers into the body at the      angle shown in the drawing. The outer sides of the feathers      should face forward, and they also need to tilt slightly      upward so they'll catch the wind and lift</em> <em>the      bird. Do not glue anything together yet, however. Instead,      stick the tail feathers in place and give your kite a first      test flight by dropping it from arm's length. If it spins,      the wings need to be adjusted or maybe even replaced. If it      takes a nose dive, add more tail feathers. When it floats      smoothly ... you've got it and can glue the feathers in      position and decorate your bird.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>The best string for your kite will be thread(on a      fairly</em> <em>full</em> <em>spool) inserted, with a      needle, completely through</em> <em>the body</em> <em>and      knotted on the other side. Finding the correct point of      entry is mostly a matter of trial and error. So needle up      and take your first stab at dead center. If-after a      little wing twisting-you find that the critter just      doesn't</em> fly <em>right, you'll have to run the string      through again at another point. (You may even need to      connect a center thread from the wing tips ... if so, make      it four times the length of the wings and tie it, at its      midpoint, to the main thread.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Then put your spool on a stick (a thin pencil or      chopstick does fine), head out into the spring breeze, and      let your feather-light kite stretch its wings!</em>    </p>
