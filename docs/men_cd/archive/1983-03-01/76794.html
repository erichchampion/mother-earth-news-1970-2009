            		            <p>      <em><strong>"There's no fool like an old fool ... you can't      beat experience."</strong></em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Jacob M. Braude</h5>      <p>      Well sir, 'round these parts, most folks know there're      <em>five</em> seasons to the year: spring, summer, fall,      winter, an' the <em>mud month.</em> An' as you kin imagine,      nary a soul here's fond of the annual axleburyin' spell      (it's sorta to weather what kudzu is to crops). But there      ain't <em>nobody</em> hates it worse'n the ol'      store-loafin' galoots what constitute the Plumtree Crossin'      Gen'rally Inebriated Society. Jist grab yerself an earful      of the fellers' conversation on a recent March afternoon,      and you'll soon see what I mean.    </p>    <p>      "Purvis!" Ott Bartlett bellowed. "My gullet's as parched as      Satan's cornpatch. I lie in dire <em>need</em> of your      homemade tonic ' "    </p>    <p>      "Don't tell <em>me</em> about it!" Purvis Jacobs snapped      back. "Y know I ain't got any!"    </p>    <p>      "Well, you don't need to go <em>remindin'</em> me of thet      mizzerble fact, do you?" Ott retorted.    </p>    <p>      All in all, it were plain to see thet those two was feelin'      feistier'n cornered crawdads. An' all the <em>rest</em> of      the ol' boys was obvi <em>ously jist</em> as ill-tempered,      'cause they took ev'ry chance they could to toss a "you      tell 'im!" . . . a "durned right!" . . . or a downright      <em>unrepeatable</em> expletive into the discussion. As any      fool could perceive, the members of the Plumtree Crossin'      Truth and Veracity League was sorely missin' their social      lubricant, thet all-purpose peacemakin' potion ... corn      whiskey.    </p>    <p>      Fer security reasons, you see, Mister Jacob's likkermakin'      facility was tucked way back up in a holler thet takes      little short of a miracle to drive to in the best of      weather ... and it's flat impossible to reach durin' the      soggy month of March. As Purvis often put it, "When the      mud's here, the moonshine ain't."    </p>    <p>      "Gents," Doc Thromberg broke in, "seein's how there's a      sorrowful lack of the medicine I'd otherwise perscribe fer      the case of the surlies I herewith behold, I suggest an      alternative remedy. Let's all git out and do somethin'      constructive."    </p>    <p>      "Yeah," Lafe Higgins agreed, "like bite the heads off'n      Purvis's chickens."    </p>    <p>      "Actually," Doc continued, "I had in mind a more      civic-minded activity ... like settin' up a booth at thet      big fund-raiser next week fer the Barren County Children's      Hospital."    </p>    <p>      "WHAT?" yapped the entire crew of laze-abouts in unison,      droppin' the pipes from their teeth, gulpin' the chaws in      their cheeks, fallin' over backwards in their chairs ... or      doin' all three at once't.    </p>    <p>      Well, I'll spare you the <em>details</em> of the ensuin'      debate. Somehow, though, those confed'rates in misery      <em>did</em> talk theirselves into particypatin' in the      project (which, I guess, goes to show the strange things      people will do when they're <em>sober). So</em> they signed      up with the Barren County Ladies Auxiliary and Highminded      Civic League-the group what was runnin' the      affair-an' agreed to be in charge of thet ol'      favorite, the young'uns' greased-pig chase.    </p>    <p>      An' since the partic'lar Saturday when this fund-raisin'      festival were held turned out to be one of those rare sunny      days thet March will tease you with once't in a while, jist      about <em>all</em> the youngsters in the entire      county-an' their parents-assembled in the town      square at Erosion junction fer the goin's on. Why, a TV      crew from the big city of Buzzard's Roost even come out to      take <em>pictures</em> of all the activities <em>(an'</em>      to interview Beatrice Snod; pebble-the head of the      women's league-who was beamin' prouder'n a pregnant      pussycat).    </p>    <p>      Finally, at around two o'clock in the afternoon, it come      time fer Plumtree's finest to stage the great greased-pig      chase. So whilst some of the old gents collected all the      tickets they'd sold and lined up the eager young      particypants, Doc Thromberg turned to Cleedy McCannon and      said, "I got the lard. Where's the pig.    </p>    <p>      "I dunno," said Cleedy. "Ain't Lafe s'posed to bring it?"    </p>    <p>      "Lafe ain't got no pigs!" answered Doc. " <em>You</em> was      s'posed to bring one!"    </p>    <p>      "Why, thet's right," said Cleedy. "I were, weren't I?"    </p>    <p>      "Listen here, Cleedy," Doc ordered, "we sold over 200      fiftycent tickets to this here thing, and I'll be cussed      from here to Sunday if we have to give the money back. So      we're goin' to <em>have</em> a greased-pig chase ... even      if those children are forced to pursue a two-legged      substitute!"    </p>    <p>      With thet, the fellers started crowdin' in around Cleedy.      "Now wait jist a minute," he cried ... but it were too      late. The entire assemblage jumped on the unfortunate      Mister McCannon, stripped off all his clothes except his      undershorts, and smeared white lard all over his body. Then      they stood him up and told the children to get ready.    </p>    <p>      ..I ain't a-doing it!" Cleedy insisted. "I <em>ain't</em>      a-doing it!"    </p>    <p>      At thet point, though, the startin' gun went off, and 200      chasecrazed young'uns charged full steam-flailin' they arms      and howlin' worse'n hounds in heat-right toward the      grease-coated apparition.    </p>    <p>      "I'm a-doing it! I'm a-doing it!" Cleedy yelled, an'      skedaddled out around the town square a couple of times      with thet pack of greasedperson chasers nippin'. at his      heels. Then he ducked down a side street and into a nearby      building . . . what turned out to be the Golden Years Rest      Home! Well, darned if the sight of a lard-covered,      undershorted runaway didn't set those umptygenarians' blood      to boilin'. " <em>After</em> thet scoundrel!" hollered one      of 'em, an' the entire brigade of rest-home residents      started off in hot persuit.    </p>    <p>      Poor Cleedy! He raced out the side door and through a dog      kennel ... accident'ly knockin' open the back gate an'      puttin' them grease-hungry <em>dogs</em> on his trail! Then      he tore in the rear of a restaurant an' come out the front      ... with the eatery's owner, chef, an' waitress hot on his      heels. Finally, he dashed <em>back</em> to the town square,      shinnied hisself right up to the top of the flagpole-I      wouldn'ta believed he coulda <em>done it,</em> covered in      lard as he were, if I hadn't seen it myself-and perched      there, pantin' for air.    </p>    <p>      Well, when Ol'' Man Bartlett an' the rest seen what were      goin' on, they figgered they'd best try fer an exit ... so      they backed a high-walled pickup next to the pole, loaded      Cleedy in, and sped away from the scene of the disaster as      fast as they could.    </p>    <p>      Two days later, when the whole kit and caboodle was      gathered in the Gen'ral Store agin, feelin' meaner an'      grouchier than ev'er, up rolled the county sheriff an' some      deputies in two patrol cars ... packed up all them ol' boys      ... an' drove 'em right back to Erosion junction. Worse      yet, waitin' right in the town square were thet Buzzard's      Roost TV crew, Missus Snodpebble, the restaurant and kennel      owners, an'a couple of ladies from the nursin' home! Well,      movin' more than a mite reluctantly, the ol' reprohates got      outa the police vehicles ... and danged if Missus      Snodpebble didn't lead the entire delegation over, grab Doc      Thromberg's hand, and say, "Congratulations! You boys has      won the prize fer the best event at the fair!"    </p>    <p>      "What?!" Doc said ... an' his jaw dropped down to his      socks.    </p>    <p>      "Thet's right," replied Missus Snodpebble, pumpin' his hand      eagerly (but lookin' right into the TV camera all the      while). "Them television folks filmed the whole chase, an'      showed it on the Buzzard's Roost evenin' news ... an'      people have been callin' in donations fer our little      children's hospital ever since!"    </p>    <p>      "Yes, an' ev'rybody comes to my restaurant now to laugh      about the greased-person chase ... an' then stays to eat!"      said the cafe proprietor.    </p>    <p>      "Folks sure found out about my kennel in a hurry, too,"      added the dog boarder.    </p>    <p>      ,"An' those children," chimed in the rest home ladies, "had      so much fun with our dear senior citizens thet they're      going to come visit ev'ry week!"    </p>    <p>      Well sir, by this point you coulda knocked Plumtree's      prizewinnemover with a single pinch of evaporated snake      spit. Somehow, though, Doc kept his feet under him long      enough to ask, "So what'll we git outa this?"    </p>    <p>      "You'll be pleased to larn thet the hospital construction      crew has offered the group what put on the best event the      services of a bulldozer fer one day," Missus Snodpebble      mouthed at the camera. "Now I'm sure you gen'lmen can find      a good use fer thet wonderful machine, cain't you.    </p>    <p>      Doc didn't have to think of a use ... it come to him by      <em>instinct</em> . "Them things can go up most any road,      no matter how <em>muddy</em> , cain't they?"    </p>    <p>      "I'm jist sartin they can," Missus Snodpebble assured him      sweetly.    </p>    <p>      "Well then, Miz Be'trice," Doc declared, as he reached out      t put his arm around his old, <em>dear friend</em> ...      Purvis Jacobs, "I b'lieve we can find some good way to use      thet thing. I do b'lieve we can."    </p>    <p>      <em>"To read without reflecting is like eating without      digesting."</em> <em>EdmundBurke</em>    </p>
