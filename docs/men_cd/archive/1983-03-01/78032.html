                    <h3>SOUTH CAROLINA'S SPECTACULAR GARDENS</h3>    <p>      People who love flowers should-at least once in their      lives-indulge themselves in a visit to South      Carolina's gardens at the peak of their blossoming season      (from mid-March to May). The most famous of these beauty      spots are Middleton, Magnolia, and Cypress Gardens (near      Charleston) ... all of which, in distinctly different ways,      reflect the charm of the Old South.    </p>    <p>      Middleton Place was the home of Henry Middleton, a      president of the Continental Congress ... his son Arthur, a      signer of the Declaration of Independence ... Arthur's son      Henry, an ambassador to Russia ... and his son Williams, a      signer of the Ordinance of Secession. This distinguished      family's gardens, laid out in 1741, are believed to be the      oldest in America. It took 100 gardeners 10 years to create      the ornamental butterfly lakes, rolling terraces, and      walkways that mirror the symmetry and elegance of formal      European gardens. A self-guided tour takes visitors past a      sprawling 1,000-year-old oak ... and along petalstrewn      paths where three of the estate's original camellia trees      still bloom. In addition, a restored house is open to the      public. Built in 1755, it served as the gentlemen's guest      wing of, the plantation mansion, which was destroyed by      Sherman's troops in 1865.    </p>    <p>      (Originally, the land was part of the dowry of Mary      Williams ... and it changed family hands when she married      Henry Middleton in 1741. After its wartime destruction,      local legend says the ghost of a little lady in gray      wandered among the ruins, grieving for the neglected      garden. She supposedly <em>stopped</em> her haunting visits      in the early 1900's, when JJ. Pringle Smith, a direct      descendant of the Middletons, began to restore the place to      its former grandeur.)    </p>    <p>      Four miles away, Magnolia Plantation and      Gardens-acquired in the late seventeenth century by      Thomas Drayton, Jr.-offers masses of fiery red      azaleas, soft pink camellias, golden yellow Lady Banksia      roses, and other flowering shrubs ... framed by trees      draped in Spanish moss.    </p>    <p>      A visit to Magnolia can include a canoe trip through a      125-acre waterfowl refuge, as well as a walk (or bicycle      ride) along the trails in the estate's 500-acre wildlife      sanctuary. Furthermore, the garden's petting zoo includes      rare miniature horses, and the plantation house features      various styles furniture <em>and</em> a gallery of local      art,    </p>    <p>      While Middleton can be described as formal and Magnolia as      romantic, Cypress Gardens-with its black, reflecting      water and its ancient baldcypress trees-is best      termed <em>mysterious.</em> Originally a part of the Dean      Hall rice plantation, it offers miles of flower-bordered      canals and paths that can be explored by boat and on foot.    </p>    <p>      Some other well-known South Carolina gardens include      Brookgreen, near Murrells Inlet, which features the      nation's largest outdoor collection of American sculpture      ... Edisto, in Orangeburg, best known for its roses . . .      Swan Lake, in Sumter, where <em>six million</em> irises      bloom each May ... Kalmia, in Hartsville, noted for its      mountain laurel ... and Hopeland, in Aiken, which houses      the Thoroughbred Hall of Fame. These (and other)      plantations, along with historic Charleston's <em>own</em>      gardens, make spring in the South something special!    </p>    <p>      For more information, write to the South Carolina.      Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism, Dept. TMEN,      1205 Pendleton Street, Columbia, South Carolina 29201.    </p>    <h3>THE VOLCANOES OF THE NORTHWESTy</h3>    <p>      Since Mount St. Helens' series of eruptions began in 1980,      there's been a growing interest in <em>all</em> of the      Pacific Northwest's volcanoes ... and one of the easiest      ways to see these impressive giants is from the air.    </p>        <p>      Tim Surface-of the Ashford Air Service-flew      timber owners, government officials, geologists, and other      scientists on more than 190 trips to Mount St. Helens in      1981 alone. And he's now organized a new series of      low-level <em>tourist</em> flights that will allow visitors      to take photos of the snow-carpeted crater of Mount Rainier      from an altitude of 1,000 feet above the peak ... view the      rapidly growing, grayish-brown lava dome of Mount St.      Helens from a vantage point just a few hundred feet away .      . . or fly past the giant, steel-blue glaciers and roaring      steam vents of Mount Baker.    </p>    <p>      Tim's 1-1/2-hour tour of Mount St. Helens (for a group of      four people) is priced at only $90 ... a 2-1/2-hour tour of      Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, and Mount St. Helens runs $185      ... a 3 1/4-hour trip that includes all that and Mount Hood      is $250 ... and a 5-hour flight, encompassing all the      previously mentioned volcanoes <em>and</em> Mount Baker      runs $350.    </p>    <p>      You can arrange to fly from the Ashford, Washington      airfield or be picked up at Seattie/Tacoma International      Airport. For reservations, write to Ashford Air Service,      Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 183, Ashford, Washington 98304 or call      206/569-2504.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Remember, you receive a free one-year subscription to      MOTHER if your travel tip is published in this column.
