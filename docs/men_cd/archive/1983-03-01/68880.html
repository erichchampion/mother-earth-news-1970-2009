                <p>      <em>A MOTHER staffer tries to find out for himself whether      audio technology can help induce. . .</em>    </p>       <p>      <em>The following article doesn't necessarily</em>      <em>represent the official opinion of the staff or</em>      <em>management of THE MOTHER EARTH</em> <em>NEWS (restricted)      Instead, it's made up of subjective</em> <em>impressions of      what I, associate editor Pat</em> <em>Stone, experienced      during the week-long Gate-</em> <em>way Program at the      Monroe Institute of Ap</em> <em>plied Sciences. I was sent      there, by this mag</em> <em>azine, when we learned that      Elisabeth Kubler-Ross (renowned expert on death and      dying,</em> <em>and the subject of next issue's Plowboy      Inter</em> <em>view) claimed to have made a      life-changing</em> <em>exploration of higher states of      consciousness</em> <em>while at the institute.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>However, although the tale of my own experience at the      rural Virginia center pales beside hers</em> (and <em>when      compared with many related to me by my coparticipants in      the program), it may still strike some readers as pretty      far-fetched. If so, that's perfectly understandable. just      remember that I'm not trying to</em> convince <em>anyone of      anything ... I'm just attempting to honestly relate some (I      couldn't tell you all in twice this space!) of what I      believe I observed and experienced.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Have a good trip!"</em> Those were the last words I      heard before Melissa Jager, the remarkable woman who's the      chief training instructor at the Monroe Institute of      Applied Sciences, turned on the first experiential stereo      tape that I-and the other participants in the      institute's Gateway Program-would hear during our      week-long stay. I was lying in my own CHEC unit (it stands      for Controlled Holistic Environmental Chamber) ... an      isolation cube complete with a comfortable air mattress, a      black curtain (to exclude distracting light), speakers, and      an excellent set of stereo headphones. I lay still with my      eyes closed, eager and anxious to experience ... to      experience ... well, I wasn't sure just <em>what</em> might      happen!    </p>        <p>      Of course, while I couldn't guess exactly what was in store      for me, I <em>had</em> gathered some background knowledge      about the institute before signing up. It was started by      Robert Monroe, a former radio show production executive who      claims to have begun, in 1958, to spontaneously undergo      bizarre personal events that he didn't understand. In      essence, Monroe's adventure-snow commonly called      out-of-body experiences, or OBE's-were typified by a      sensation that his conscious mental self had lifted from      his resting physical form and (with an ethereal "body" of      its own) traveled by the power of thought to places near,      far, and otherworldly.    </p>    <p>      Bob's full story is detailed in his wellknown book,      <em>Journeys Out of the Body.</em> I'd read the volume a      decade earlier and hadover the years-talked with several      people who claimed to have had out-of-body experiences      themselves. (For instance, a close college friend had told      me that he once watched his own body from the ceiling of      his apartment, while his roommate frantically worked to      rescue the sleeping form from a fire!) In fact, as soon as      it became known around the office that I was supposed to go      to "Out of Body U.", an occasional cohort would pull me      aside and-often in a secretive voice-admit his      or her own experience with "astral travel".    </p>    <p>      At any rate, I believed-particularly after hearing      such accounts-that OBE's, as well as many other      experiences related to altered states of consciousness,      were possible ... but about the only encounter <em>Id</em>      had with any so-called higher energies consisted merely of      feeling an electricity-like energy (called      <em>prana</em> by yogis) moving up my spine and into my      skull during a year of hatha yoga classes. So while my      attitude toward the adventure I was about to undergo was      open and receptive, I was-in effect-a "New Age      novice".    </p>    <p>      Bob Monroe now employs modern sound technology to help      other people reach various higher states of awareness. (The      OBE was supposed to be only one <em>possible</em> outcome      among many.) His method is based on two premises: [1] If      your brain "hears" a sound frequency it can create      electrically itself, it will tend to imitate that same wave      signal (Monroe secured a patent on this      "frequency-following response" in 1975). [2] You can't      directly <em>hear</em> such sound waves (they're mostly      pitched too low for the ears to pick up), but they can be      communicated to the mind by playing slightly different      wavelengths to opposite ears through stereo headphones.      Your brain will then assimilate the two pulses and-in      effect-"hear" the difference between them! Thus, if      you wanted to send a 10-cycle-per-second (CPS)      signal-a low alpha signal-to the mind, you      could play a 100-CPS sound wave in one ear and a I 10-CPS      signal to the other. Your brain would, it's claimed, be      aware of the information received by the separate ears,      hearing both signals <em>and their difference</em> ... a 10      <em>-cycle-per-second</em> wave.    </p>        <p>      Having worked at home with some of the institute's      Discovery tapes (a set of six cassettes that can be used      either independently of the center's program <em>or</em> as      a preparation for the Gateway course), I believed that      Monroe's brain-hemisphere-uniting process-called "      HemiSync"- <em>could</em> work. In fact, my biggest      fear was that I'd simply show so little aptitude for      alternative consciousness that I'd have a drab,      disappointing experience and end up with no personal growth      <em>(and</em> nothing to report). Conversely, my      <em>goals</em> were to have an actual out-of-body      experience ... to gain more spiritual insight ... to grow      as a loving person ... and, of course, to get material for      an interesting article.    </p>    <p>      In short, that's where I stood-or rather      lay-one Sunday morning last May when our trainer      started playing the first tape.    </p>    <p>      <em>The first tape.</em> Immediately after Melissa's      friendly send-off, the sound of ocean surf (which underlay      every tape as an "audio bed") rose up and filled my      headphones. Next, Bob Monroe's deep,      soothing-recorded-voice told us to adjust our      headsets so that the volume was balanced between our ears      and we heard his voice in the <em>right</em> channel. Then      humming, almost hissing, tones-which were the      Hemi-Sync signals-blended in with the sea wave      sounds.    </p>    <p>      At this point Bob's voice began describing the four steps      of the "pre-preparation process" . . . a procedure that      would serve as the opening ritual of every tape. The first      step was to construct an "energy conversion box", a mental      vision of a chest in which we were to "lock away" all of      our everyday concerns (such as my worry about having to      write an article) and thereby leave our minds free and      unburdened.    </p>    <p>      Second, chanting voices on the tape pro vided the cue for      us to begin "resonant tun ing": a series of deep,      open-throated breaths during which we inhaled while      visualizing sparkling energy entering our bodies and rising      up into our heads and exhaled while chanting "aaah",      "oooh", or "ummm" and mentally <em>releasing</em> the      energy.    </p>        <p>      Third, we were to construct a "rebal", or "resonant energy      balloon": a sphere of energy <em>outside</em> our bodies.      We would do this by "shooting" the energy gathered during      resonant tuning out the tops of our heads, down around our      bodies, and back in at our feet.    </p>    <p>      Last, we were to repeat the Gateway Affirmation, the      institute's credo, which begins, "I am more than my      physical body. Because I am more than physical matter, I      can perceive that which is greater than the physical      world." (It goes on to proclaim the individual's deep      desire to learn to use <em>beneficial</em> higher energy      systems, and to be guided and protected.)    </p>    <p>      Well, even though I'd practiced <em>all</em> of these      techniques on the Discovery home tapes, I still had some      difficulty acting them out. My imaginary worry box      <em>didn't</em> stop me from getting distracted with      outside thoughts. And although I made an earnest mental      attempt to rebal, I didn't feel as if I were pushing any      energy at all around my body. On the other hand, the      Hemi-Sync signals and chanting did invoke the type of      spinal energy flow I'd felt in my old yoga classes. In      fact, my whole body felt stimulated as if by a pleasing      charge of energy.    </p>    <p>      After about 45 minutes, the tape wound down and brought us      back to normal consciousness (often called "C-1" or "Focus      1 " at the institute). We all left our individual booths      and gathered in a meeting room to discuss the experience.    </p>    <p>      Thus began the ongoing "take a tape and then relate"      routine of the week. Except for the excellent vegetarian      meals, a two-hour break each afternoon, and some movie      viewing, that's what we did ... at least six times a day!    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Focus 10</em> . The next tapes we worked on took us      from Focus 1 to Focus 10 ... a consciousness level where      "your mind is awake and your body is asleep". Induced by      combining low theta (sleep) brain-wave signals with higher      beta (wakeful) ones, Focus 10 was to become a launching pad      for all the other experiences to come.    </p>    <p>      It took me a tape or two to get going, but eventually I was      having great fun! My internal energy flow seemed stronger      and stronger. I was even beginning to feel the sensation of      <em>some</em> energy shooting out of my head during the      rebal phase (although no matter how hard I tried , I      couldn't make this looping flow extend below my knees). And      Focus 10-whatever it was-did give my whole body      a tingly, alert feeling.    </p>    <p>      <em>Intro Focus 12.</em> The last tape of the day was also      the first one to go <em>beyond</em> the six Discovery      cassettes and into new (to me) territory ... to Focus 12,      "the state of expanded awareness". After the initial      prepreparation process (during which I finally      began-with difficulty-to be able to feel that I      was projecting some rebal energy down to my feet!), Bob's      recorded voice led us up to Focus 10 ... counted to 12 ...      back to 10 ... up to 12 again ... back to 10 ... and then      down to C- 1.    </p>    <p>      The moment before Bob's voice first called out "10", I felt      my body zapped all over with remarkably intense      electricity. When he led the count up to 12, I tried to      imagine an expanded self (even though I had no idea what      that really meant!) ... and suddenly my chest got tight. I      felt as if I had to fight to breathe. I was also hit with      rushes of harsh light, and my body was racked with      vibrating energy.    </p>    <p>      In fact, I became so <em>frightened</em> by these      sensations that I instinctively chanted the Gateway      Affirmation ("I am more than my physical body. . . .") out      loud to get a hold on myself. Finally, when the tape was      over, I did some stretching exercises to calm down the      residual physical tinglings ... and prayed.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <em>From a follow-up interview with Bob Monroe:</em> "The      signals we send in the sequence of a tape follow a lot of      the gradients of sleep ... up to a certain point. Then, at      Focus 10, we insert some high beta signals on <em>top</em>      of the already established theta tones, in order to trigger      a waking consciousness while leaving the body asleep. And      when we go to 12, we drop the body down even deeper, into      delta sleep, while-using a specialized mixture of at      least four different sets of beta signals-we increase      the level of mental wakefulness.    </p>    <p>      "Now you should understand that according to most      researchers, the high beta signals we use here are not      analogous to any known brain-wave patterns and have no      particular value. Such scientists typically think of beta      signals as going up to 30 or 40 CPS. We use much higher      wave pulses here, however. In fact, when we try to help      trigger out-of-body states, we employ beta signals of      around 2877.3 CPS."    </p>    <p>      <em>Self responsibility.</em> When we rejoined our group, I      told the others how very trying my tape experience had      been. And-I'll admit-I kind of expected our      instructor to offer comfort. Instead, she challenged me:      "What are you afraid of? Don't <em>resist</em> pain ...      that just increases it. Move <em>into</em> the experience,      so you can move <em>through</em> it."    </p>    <p>      I was a little startled by her blunt reaction, too. But      then I realized that her advice was likely sound,      and-after all-I hadn't <em>asked</em> for      emotional support. Besides, as I came to observe them      throughout the week, I noted that Melissa and her cotrainer      (a visiting psychiatrist) expected the program participants      to take responsibility for themselves. True, they would      always keep an eye on people who seemed troubled or didn't      leave their CHEC units after a tape, but they never      encouraged any of us to act dependent or even to share our      experiences. Instead, they gave us respect and a right to      privacy.    </p>    <p>      <em>Monday</em> ... <em>clicking out.</em> According to      Monroe, tape listeners will automatically "click out" into      a deep sleep if they're not ready to deal with what they're      hearing. And, indeed, more than one member of our group had      trouble staying awake during the initial tapes. Some past      Gateway participants had reputedly slept through every tape      for three days ... only to wake up during a Hemi-Sync      experience on the fourth afternoon and find themselves      hovering above their bodies!    </p>    <p>      Of course, I had to wonder whether "clicking out" was a      real phenomenon or just a euphemism for catnapping. And I      couldn't answer that question ... until one day, later in      the week (during a Focus 15 tape), when we were supposed to      travel back mentally on a wheel of time and explore our      past. As soon as I decided to attempt to "visit" a      traumatic and still disturbing incident in my childhood, I      started feeling weary. The next thing I knew, the entire      45-minute tape was over!    </p>    <p>      Once we regrouped, many other members confessed that they,      too, had passed out. Melissa then told us that, in her      experience, well over half of program participants "click      out" on that particular tape. "A lot of people don't like      to face parts of their past," she said.    </p>    <p>      <em>Out-of-body practice.</em> On Monday we also tried a      Focus 12 tape which helped us play with five different ways      of leaving our bodies ... such as rising up on end like a      telephone pole, rolling out like a log, or simply floating      up. By this time, I was no longer hit with the formerly      experienced overpowering energy during the Focus 12      state-in fact, my <em>first</em> exposure to every      new level was the most physically intense-so I was      able to try all five techniques calmly.    </p>    <p>      I didn't "go" anywhere, though. Maybe I was tensing my body      too much. Or perhaps I was trying too hard, because after I      attempted to levitate my left "astral" hand, I opened my      eyes ... and discovered I was moving my <em>real</em> hand!    </p>    <p>      <em>Bob</em> <em>Monroe</em> : "If any people come here      expecting that we can guarantee them an out-of-body      experience, we give them their hats and say goodbye. Of      course, most individuals who hope for an OBE learn other,      perhaps more important, lessons here. You see, there are a      lot more <em>useful</em> ways to handle the same energy      that creates the out-of-body state."    </p>    <p>      <em>Melissa:</em> "Only a small percentage of the people      who come here have an OBE during their stay. A good number      achieve one a few days after they return home-once      they've given up hope of it-because their eagerness      for the experience actually kept them from having it! After      all, an expectation is a way of saying you can't do      something now."    </p>    <p>      <em>My thoughts:</em> "But how can I stop wishing for an      out-of-body experience if I really think I want one?" I      felt trapped by that paradox much of the week. After all, I      reasoned, what better proof could I receive that I am more      than a physical body ... and what more exciting event could      I have to write an article about?    </p>    <p>      <em>The group:</em> I soon learned that most of the folks      attending our session had more extensive backgrounds in      alternative consciousness research than I did. And as the      week went on, I couldn't fail to be impressed by their      experience, their commitment,      and-especially-their eagerness to exchange      information with like-minded people. (Many of them have to      keep their expanded-consciousness experiences      <em>secret</em> most of the time ... since their      friends-and, often, employers-could be shocked      to hear about such things.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, the fact that the Monroe program (which isn't      advertised anywhere) is both difficult to find out about      and expensive (the week cost $850) helps limit participants      to very committed people rather than attracting mildly      curious "New Age dilettantes". Our group, for instance,      included a parapsychological healer from Europe who claimed      to have cured his own debilitating childhood case of      multiple sclerosis by going out of his body and performing      an "astral operation"!    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, some members of the grouplike me-tended      to have less dramatic personal events ... and to spend      almost as much time wondering if our experiences were real      as we did learning how to deal with them. Yet we also      tackled our extraordinary lessons with focused sincerity.    </p>    <p>      Patterning. One of the "second state" skills we worked on      during the week was patterning ... which involves going      into a Focus 12 state, "balling up" a question you want      answered-or a request-inside your head, and      then "shooting" that query out to the universe at large.      And although the process might at first seem to be merely a      new-fangled version of traditional prayer, we were told      that patterning demanded some specific and specialized      techniques.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, we were supposed to re lease      completely-even forget-a patterned request      rather than attempt to hold an expectation concerning it in      our minds. Furthermore, it was equally important, Melissa      told us, to add the "disclaimer" that we wanted our wishes      fulfilled only if they would be in the interests of our      higher selves ... to keep them from possibly backfiring.      Our instructor also advised us to phrase our requests in      the present tense ("If you ask for something to happen in      the future, the result may always stay in the future") and      to think positively, as if our patterned questions had      already been answered ("You're creating an effect ... the      cause will catch up to it").    </p>    <p>      <em>Tuesday.</em> States like Focus 10 and Focus 12 were      starting to take shape for me (instead of simply giving me      intense physical rushes). Focus 10 definitely did involve a      "body asleep, mind awake" feeling. And in the less-relaxed      Focus 12, I consistently felt a vibrant energy extending to      the borders of my rebal cocoon.    </p>    <p>      While working with new tapes, we did a variety of exercises      today, such as attempting to send visual color energies      (red for vitality, purple for healing, green to wash out      negative emotion) throughout our bodies ... and      experimenting with a "bubbling away" technique to help deal      with personal fears. (After this last tape, one group      member related how she first visualized a snake, then      "bubbled away" her phobic fear of the reptile ... and      saw-in its place-a brown belt, which reminded      her of long-forgotten beatings she'd received from her      father!)    </p>    <p>      Some of the day's tapes gave me strong physical sensations      ... others had little obvious meaning or effect ... and a      few did indeed seem to portend insight or power. Yet      perhaps equally significant for me was a "physical level"      event that took place when I asked the parapsychological      healer in our group to cure my new-and      irritating-case of poison ivy. In response, he told      me to take a bath in a half-and-half mixture of human urine      and the milk from dandelion stems. When I protested that I      could <em>never</em> gather enough of those two required      liquids, he stated simply, "Well, <em>visualize</em> it! I      hat's the same thing!"    </p>    <p>      So, alone in my room, I sat down and imagined an elaborate      treatment scenario ... complete with specialized machinery      for harvesting millions of dandelion milk droplets, and      lots of beer drinking to help me produce the other      ingredient. Finally, I pictured dunking myself three times      in the noxious mixture.    </p>    <p>      When it was over, my skin really did feel covered with a      caky crust. And soon after that 3 1 was-cross my      heart!-taken aback by the unmistakable stench of      stale urine! In fact, the odor was so strong that I was      hesitant to rejoin the group ... until I decided that      <em>they</em> couldn't possibly smell the product of my      fantasy!    </p>    <p>      The result? My poison ivy did <em>not</em> go away, but ran      its usual several-day course. The itching, however,      <em>stopped ...</em> and to an inveterate rashscratcher      like me, that relief was as good as a cure. True, the      familiar irritating sensations returned about once a day      thereafter, but if I spent a few moments revisualizing my      treatment scenario, the maddening urge to scratch went away      ... every time.    </p>    <p>      Was I just fooling myself? Well, as far as I was concerned,      that didn't matter ... because the technique worked!    </p>    <p>      <em>Bob Monroe:</em> "The Gateway process provides a      dramatic means of discovering oneself, and then making full      use of one's potential. We provide the tools ... which are      mental, riot physical, ones, They can then be used in a      variety of ways for such purposes as practical problem      solving, gaining self-knowledge, or maintaining mental      health-but what each person <em>does</em> with the      tools is an individual matter.    </p>    <p>      "We don't try to indoctrinate people. Instead, we say,      'Don't take our word about anything ... but find out for      yourself what's true. The tools we are providing should      help you do this.'    </p>    <p>      "We have only one piece of dogma that we want to knock into      people's heads: 'You <em>are</em> more than your physical      body. If you will seriously consider-and try working      with-that assumption, you'll find here the      opportunity to <em>know</em> that it's so.'    </p>    <p>      <em>Wednesday.</em> This was one of my best days. Almost      all of the tapes felt really accessible and enjoyable. And      such basic maneuvers as popping a rebal or going into Focus      10 or 12 were now ridiculously easy. In addition, I was      gaining a greater sense of <em>control</em> over these      processes. One example of that occurred during a tape on      Focus 15, "the state of no time". (According to Bob, time      is merely an assumption made by one's consciousness. People      can therefore learn to acknowledge, experience, and      utilize-by doing such things as peering into the past      or future-the fact that time does not exist.) Now I      can't <em>guarantee</em> that I experienced timelessness      while I was in Focus 15, but I did feel that my mind was in      a beautifully clear, still, and relaxed place. In fact, I      felt so good "up there" that when Monroe's taped voice      started to bring us back down to C-1, I just took off the      headphones, moved myself back up to 15, and enjoyed it for      a while. (Melissa applauds such actions: "It's important to      ultimately shake your dependence on tapes ... to learn to      reach these states without using 'training wheels'    </p>    <p>      <em>Going Out?</em> After one of the day's tapes, a group      member told us that she saw the words "I am more than my      physical body" spin in a vortex overhead. Then her arms      began to ache and to rise straight up in the air. "I would      have bet a paycheck," she said, "that my real arms were      sticking up ... but when I looked, they were still on my      chest!"    </p>    <p>      Melissa then gave us a lot of advice on how to get all the      way out if we feel ourselves starting to separate from our      physical bodies: "Think of something you really want, and      mentally try to reach for it. Or speed up the process by      imagining yourself hopping onto a Ferris wheel. But don't      tense up and hold your breath, or deliberate about what's      happening to you, or you may squelch it."    </p>    <p>      And me? I'm trying to stop <em>hoping</em> for an OBE.      Instead, I'm attempting to pattern that I already am out of      body ... and back <em>in, of</em> course!    </p>    <p>      <em>The problem of trust.</em> Several members of the group      have expressed the thought that although sensations,      insights, and messages received during a tape session may      feel completely real at the time, they can't help q      uestioning the validity of the experience once they regain      normal consciousness. When they asked our trainer if their      tape experiences were authentic, she responded, "You're the      only one who can judge. Whenever you reach to us for      validation, all we can do is show you consensus ... in the      form of statements made by many other people that these      types of things have happened to. Yet ultimately, the      extent to which you <em>can</em> validate yourself will      determine the extent to which your reality will be able to      expand further."    </p>    <p>      One group member (a Gateway veteran) added, "I didn't      really believe the answers I was receiving through these      processes until they disagreed with the course of action I      would normally have chosen ... yet they <em>worked!"</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Thursday</em> ... <em>the elation series.</em> Today we      went through four tapes in which we were supposed to      gradually "elate our consciousness" to encompass the entire      earth ... the solar system ... the galaxy ... and wherever      we wanted to explore. The aim of the series seemed to be      that all-awareness experience, typical of many Eastern      religions, known as cosmic consciousness.    </p>    <p>      I went both "up" and "down" on these tapes. I did      experience many strange sensations. It seemed-once      again-that my consciousness was being stretched an I      was beginning to encounter new levels of awareness. At the      same time, though, a ring of sharp physical pain began to      develop at my elbows. The ache became so intense during the      third Elation tape that I quickly counted myself back down      to Focus 1, took the headphones off for a while, and rubbed      my arms.    </p>    <p>      <em>Friday</em> ... Focus 21. According to an entire      cosmology that Bob and his researchers were apparently      given from "beyond" (the institute offers cassette      recordings of these "explorer series" transmissions), there      are 21 levels of physical life. Seven of these encompass      the range of human existence, while the highest-Level      21-provides the beginning of a bridge to      <em>nonphysical</em> spirit forms.    </p>    <p>      As always, we weren't asked simply to <em>accept</em> these      ideas, but to try working with them and see what happened.      So we moved up to a new state, Focus 21 (which was, in      theory, parallel to Level 21) and tried to reach out for      communication with the beyond. I didn't meet any      identifiable spirits during this tape (as did the member of      our group who related afterward that she'd had a deeply      profound contact with her deceased and formerly estranged      mother), yet I did have a personally powerful and      meaningful experience. I was flushed several times with      feelings of love and-through a vision of people      undertaking symbolic activities in a variety of different      rooms-gained some moving (and, I think, truthful)      insights into the emotional difficulties of several      individuals I know.    </p>    <p>      In addition, my lower arms started aching again ... and      this time, my forearms felt as if they were beginning to      rise. I tried using mental Ferris wheels to encourage the      process, but I think that my self-consciousness stopped it      instead. Figuring my hands were only about six inches off      the bed, but that I'd better check quick or they'd lose      even that slight elevation, I opened my eyes ... and saw      that my forearms-while they may have been pressing up      a <em>little</em> on my covering sheet-were still on      the bed!    </p>    <p>      Oh, how I wished my hands had felt way high      up-instead of a measly few inches-so I could      have been <em>positive I</em> wasn't kidding myself. But      then I realized that the reality or nonreality of one "out      of hands" experience wasn't all that important. The real      lesson, I became certain, was that the processes I'd been      going through during the week were definitely beginning to      lead me to higher states of consciousness. I now      <em>knew</em> without doubt that these altered states      existed and that I had some tools for working with them      (and was even convinced that sometime-in my lifetime-I      would reach an out-of-body state).    </p>    <p>      In a way, though, I felt like a child who, having just      learned to climb the steps to the high diving board at a      swimming pool, jiggles up and down on the edge of the board      ... tightening up with nervous tension, yet not ready to      jump.    </p>    <p>      My real body was the diving board I wasn't ready to leave.      And something our instructor told me privately just before      we took the last tape of the day-and of the      week-made me realize that as long as I had to fulfill      the role of a journalist, it may have been both impossible      for me to jump off the board <em>and</em> best that I      couldn't. Melissa admitted that she was both "awed and      appalled" that I had managed to fully participate in the      course while working toward preparing a report on it. Other      writers who'd come to Gateway on assignment had all quit      part way through ... either from disbelief or because they      finally couldn't handle it.    </p>    <p>      So the fact that the personal insights into higher reality      that I gained during this week were completely      convincing-though not as dramatically earthshaking as      I'd hoped-may well have been "in the interests of my      higher self"'. Someday, though, I'd like to go back to the      Monroe Institute <em>on my own</em> ... and see what      happens then.    </p>    <p>      <em>The last tape.</em> I can't tell you all of the moving      experiences I had during-or connected with-our      final tape, but I will share one ... an event that's had      great importance for me. It concerns my then fourmonth-old      daughter, Jessica.    </p>    <p>      When Jesse was born in February 1982, my 2-1/2-year-old boy      Nathan had been seriously ill for two weeks. Indeed, a few      short hours before my daughter's birth, my wife and I      finally admitted our mutual fear that our son might die ...      and just three hours <em>after</em> the delivery, I was      taking the pain-racked boy to an appointment with medical      specialists.    </p>    <p>      Nathan eventually recovered. However, my emotional      preoccupation with my son throughout Jesse's arrival, and      during the first days of her life, apparently hampered my      ability to establish a good relationship with my daughter.      She couldn't relax in my arms, or even look at me for long      without crying. We both felt uncomfortable with each other.    </p>    <p>      This problem troubled me deeply, so during our last Gateway      experience-a patterning tape-I asked to have a      close, loving relationship with my daughter. As previously      instructed, I didn't put a time frame on my wish ... yet in      the back of mind, I couldn't help thinking I'd be grateful      if our relationship turned around in a few <em>years.</em>    </p>    <p>      When I got off the plane the next day after my return trip,      then, I was eager to greet my wife and son, but nervous      about seeing Jessica. Remembering that the one time I left      <em>Nathan</em> for a few days during his infancy, he'd      almost seemed to forget who I was, I couldn't help fearing      that what little bond I had established with my daughter      would have dissolved and that she'd be even less      comfortable with me now than before.    </p>    <p>      Yet when I walked up to greet my family, Jessica saw me ...      and just <em>beamed.</em> Her face glowed with a delight      I'd never seen her show for anyone except her mother.    </p>    <p>      And she's been happy and loving with me ever since.    </p>     <hr />    <p>      <em>Postscript. What about afterward? Does the Monroe      program have any lasting effects?</em> <em>was able to      contact five of the members of my Gateway group seven      months after our one-week session. All felt they had gained      a deeper knowledge of themselves through the program, and      that their experiences there had been personally authentic      and meaningful. They varied greatly in the degree to which      they were incorporating what they'd learned into their      daily lives, though. One, for instance, only uses the Focus      10 method for keeping his mind aware-while resting-to help      him investigate his dreams ... and another, caught up with      simply surviving in the struggle of day-today life, just      uses Monroe relaxing techniques to relieve particularly      hectic moments. At the other end of the spectrum, two      members put the tools to work quite frequently ... going      into a Focus 10 or 12 state to receive prompt answers to      difficult decisions, for example, or even popping rebals to      help repel antagonistic dogs!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I, too, feel that the personal and spiritual lessons I      learned from the program are valid ... but I've definitely      been remiss about applying Monroe's technology in my      day-to-day life. I rarely listen to any Hemi-Sync tapes,      and I have difficulty mustering up strong energy flows.      Yet-call it coincidence or cause and effect-when I apply      the methods, they almost always seem to work. The poison      ivy itch remedy has never failed me (or my wife). The      institute's Catnapper tape (which condenses the brain-wave      patterns of a normal 90-minute sleep cycle into 30 minutes)      has given me, and two friends, refreshing half-hour rests.      Once, after a hard day of rototilling, I used purple energy      to prevent subsequent-and normally almost inevitable-back      pain ... and had no "after aches". And the results I've      patterned for-whether they were as trivial as avoiding a      driver's license hassle or as significant as improving a      serious family problem-have always been favorable.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If you'd like to learn more about the center, you can      write the Monroe Institute, Dept.
