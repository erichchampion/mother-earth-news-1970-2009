                <p>      Happiness is to "travel into a very far country, and even      out of ourselves".<br />      (Thomas Browne)    </p>       <p>      We're very excited about the tours MOTHER will be offering      for the remainder of this year and during 1984. Just look      at this lineup: the horticultural practices of Japan ...      Scotland's New Age lifestyles . . . alternative energy in      Australia ... the wildlife of Rwanda and Tanzania ...      biking Inner Mongolia in China ... and trekking Ladakh's      Tibetan Plateau! And of course, our travelers will be able      to share these incredible experiences with other MOTHER      readers, who are <em>-</em> as we've discovered over      the years <em>-fabulous</em> companions!    </p>    <p>      Because of space limitations, we can give you only the      following brief outlines of our upcoming adventures, but      you can write to us for more details.    </p>            <h3>THE PLANTS AND GARDENS OF JAPAN</h3>    <p>      As we went to press, there were only a few openings left on      our springtime horticultural study tour of Japan (April 21      to May 12, 1983) with Dr. John L. Creech, former head of      the U.S. Arboretum in Washington, D.C. and one of the      Western world's top experts on Japanese gardening      practices. However, there's always the possibility of a      last-minute cancellation, so if you'd like to visit some of      the Orient's most exquisite gardens <em>-</em> at the      <em>peak</em> of their beauty <em>-</em> call us, at      704/693-0211, to find out whether any space is available.      (The all-inclusive cost, from San Francisco, is $3,795 ...      which would have to be paid right away.)    </p>    <h3>A RETURN TO FINDHORN AND FRIENDS</h3>    <p>      Last year's visit to the New Age Scottish community of      Findhorn, and the nearby island of Erraid (which a few      members caretake and farm), was so delightful that we      decided to repeat the experience ... from June I to 23,      1983.    </p>    <p>      This time, we'll fly from New York to Edinburgh, where      we'll spend two days sightseeing and recovering from jet      lag before proceeding by train to Findhorn, on Scotland's      northeast coast. There, we'll participate in an "Experience      Week" . . . working and playing with the community's      creative citizens, as we learn from their fresh approaches      to old problems.    </p>    <p>      Next, we'll travel <em>across</em> Scotland, past Loch      Ness, for a week's unstructured stay on Erraid (it's      located in the Inner Hebrides). You'll have plenty of time      to explore this rugged, splendid little island (which      served as a setting for some of Robert Louis Stevenson's      most delightful tales) ... to help the fine folks who live      there with the farming and fishing chores (if you feel so      moved) ... and to visit the neighboring island of Iona,      from which Christianity spread throughout Britain and      northern Europe.    </p>    <p>      When we leave Erraid, we'll travel down the length of Great      Britain to Glastonbury, sightseeing along the way. Then,      while staying in Glastonbury (the legendary burial place of      King Arthur) we'll visit Stonehenge, Avebury, and Cadbury      Castle ... and attend a Midsummer Eve celebration. Finally,      we'll overnight in London before flying home.    </p>    <p>      The price, which includes round-trip airfare from New York      and all other expenses (except for a few meals en route and      in Glastonbury), is only $1,790, and a $200 deposit will      reserve your place for this fine adventure of the mind,      body, <em>and</em> spirit.    </p>    <h3>AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL SOLAR      CONGRESS</h3>    <p>      We're pleased to be able to offer a ten-day trip to the      International Solar Energy Society Congress in Perth,      Australia (August 9 to 19, 1983) for as little as $1,395,      including airfare from San Francisco and university      housing, but <em>excluding</em> the convention registration      fee (it will run $150 for ISES members, $170 for      nonmembers, $50 for student members, $60 for student      nonmembers, and $50 for accompanying guests).    </p>    <p>      This major energy forum will offer a wide range of      technical sessions, seminars, workshops, opportunities for      both formal and informal discussion with leaders in the      field, and one of the most exciting exhibits ever held in      the Southern Hemisphere. In addition, the tour offers      optional stopovers in Auckland, Honolulu, and Tahiti ...      and even a circle tour of the East, which includes visits      to alternative-energy sites in Thailand, Hong Kong, and      Japan. (Write to find out about the costs of these various      tour options.) A $200 deposit is required with your      registration.    </p>    <h3>AFRICA'S MIGHTY MOUNTAIN GORILLAS</h3>    <p>      When we decided to go on an African camping safari (January      6 to 24, 1984) to search for the rare mountain gorillas of      Rwanda and to view Tanzania's other spectacular wildlife,      we knew immediately that we could find no better tour      leaders than our Ecoscience columnists and renowned      biologists, Anne and Paul Ehrlich, and their associates      John and Cheryl Holdren.    </p>    <p>      There is no more striking natural wonder in East Africa      than its wildlife, and this three-week journey will let us      see the best that the area has to offer: the Lake Manyara      region, where the elephants <em>-</em> many of which      sport incredibly long tusks <em>-</em> are some of      the oldest on the continent, and where lions spend the hot      afternoons sprawled on the limbs of acacia trees ... the      Ngorongoro Crater, whose grassy floor contains Africa's      largest permanent concentration of animals ... the      unmatched Serengeti Plains, where giraffes, ostriches, and      zebras abound ... Lake Victoria, one of the world's most      alluring inland seas ... and Rwanda's Virunga volcanoes,      where we'll observe some of the earth's rarest and most      interesting creatures, the mountain gorillas, mighty      masters of Africa's rain forests. And, of course, this      wealth of natural beauty will be enhanced by the wide range      of knowledge that our tour leaders will bring to the      unforgettable outdoor excursion.    </p>    <p>      The all-inclusive cost from New York is $3,380, and $300      reserves one of the limited number of spaces available.    </p>    <h3>BIKING INNER MONGOLIA</h3>    <p>      In late May of 1984 (the exact dates are still to be set),      we'll be sponsoring what is probably the most exciting      bicycle tour offered <em>anywhere</em> ... a trip through      the grasslands and steppes of China's Inner Mongolia      Autonomous Region, which <em>-</em> of <em>all</em>      the places recently opened in China <em>-</em> surely      ranks among the most colorful.    </p>    <p>      The tour will begin with four days in Beijing, including      bike excursions to the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs. We'll      then strike out westward to the Shanxi Province and the      town of Datong ... site of the spectacular Dunhuang Caves,      which date back to 366 A.D. and contain the world's largest      Buddhist art treasury, housing over 484,200 square feet of      murals and 2,000 statues.    </p>    <p>      From there, we'll cross the border into Inner Mongolia,      biking to such ancient towns as Wuchuan, Wulang-Bulang,      Baotou, Xilinhot, and Hohhot. What's more, along the route      we'll spend some of our nights in yurts with the local      tribes.    </p>    <p>      This 28-day excursion is, however, only for the hardy ...      as we bike up to 60 kilometers a day. The all-inclusive      cost, from the West Coast, is $3,183 ... and a deposit of      $300 is required.    </p>    <h3>TREKKING THE TIBETAN PLATEAU</h3>    <p>      From July 15 to August 7, 1984 we're planning an      extraordinary visit to the incredibly spectacular land      called Ladakh . . . often referred to as "the roof of the      world" or "Little Tibet". Although this remote area is      technically attached to northern India, its culture has      always linked it with Tibet. Indeed, the language, the      clothing, the architecture, and the traditions are all very      similar those of Tibet (as that country was prior to the      Chinese conquest and the region's predominant religion-its      major guiding force over the centuries <em>-</em> is      Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism.    </p>    <p>      This, too, is a trip only for those in very good physical      condition Though we will stay over in the famous houseboats      on fabled Dal Lake in Srinagar, and travel by bus for the      first leg of the trip, out travelers must be able      <em>-</em> once we start trekking <em>-</em> to      negotiate very steep mountain trails that will climb as      high as 17,500 feet! However, as we view wild rock      formations, wine-red scree, deep ravines soaring Himalayan      snow peaks, and the high desert punctuated brilliant green      oases <em>-</em> and visit ancient monasteries,      native home and self-sufficient villages, gaining insights      into a traditional way life that has seen little change for      more than a thousand years <em>-</em> energy expended      to experience this timeless land will be more the amply      rewarded.    </p>    <p>      The all-inclusive cost (except for a few meals) of this      24-day venture is $3,330, and a $300 deposit is required.      To sign up for any of our trips, send your deposit      <em>-</em> $50 of which is nonrefundable      <em>-</em> by certified check or money order to Moth      Tours, 105 Stoney Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North lina      28791.    </p>
