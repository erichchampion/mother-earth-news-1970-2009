                    <p>      <em>You can solve the problem of space in which to stash      off-season and the like with...</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by BETTY L. WILEY    </h5>    <p>      Waste of any kind irritates me ... and I was long      frustrated by my inability to make good use of the dusty,      narrow space beneath my family's beds. Of course, there      <em>are</em> ready-made "dresser beds" available, but I      found the prices to be just too high. And though I went so      far as to hunt up a number of plans for do-it-yourself      storage sleepers, it seemed that those sets of instructions      were more confusing-and potentially      time-consuming-than I'd hoped.    </p>    <p>      Finally, I decided to take the situation (and a hammer) in      hand ... and design <em>and</em> build my oldest son a      storage bed, from scratch! To my surprise, the project      turned out to be downright easy. For an investment of $22      worth of plywood, a bottle of white glue, and some      finishing nails, I was able to build a simple (some would      even say crude) but functional piece of furniture.    </p>    <p>      By following the cutting and assembly instructions below,      you too can transform some under-bed space-which is      probably not being used for anything other than breeding      dust balls-into a valuable storage area!    </p>    <h3>      CUTTING INSTRUCTIONS    </h3>        <p>      <strong>SHEET A</strong>    </p>    <p>      [ 1] Cut the 4" waste strip from one end. (Always measure      and cut one piece at a time to allow for "kerf" which is      the wood removed by the saw blade.)<br />      [2] Cut the 17"-wide piece that'll form one end and      onebrace.<br />      [3] Rip the 3" waste strip from one side of the remaining      panel.<br />      [4] Rip the 7"-wide top piece from the remaining      board.<br />      [5] Cut the end piece to 37-1/2" long . . . leaving the 17"      brace.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SHEET B</strong><br />      [1] Repeat the first two steps taken in cutting Sheet      A.<br />      [2] Rip the 17"-wide back piece, leaving the 31"-wide      top.<br />      [3] Cut the end piece to 37-1/2" . . . leaving the second      17" brace.    </p>        <h3>      <em>ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS</em>    </h3>        <p>      [1] Glue and nail both end pieces to the back . . . as      shown in the illustration.<br />      [2] Fasten-again using both glue and nails-the bottom to      the assembly.<br />      [3] Turn the bed-to-be over.<br />      [4] Glue and nail the narrow top piece to the back (as in      the construction photo).<br />      [5] Again referring to the photo, install the first      brace.<br />      [6] Using glue and nails, secure the large top piece to the      ends (you can also run a bead of glue along the joint      between the two top sections).<br />      [7] Fasten the second brace. (I glued and nailed its top      edge in place, but - not wanting to turn the bed over      - I shored up its foot with the pieces of scrap shown      in the photo of the finished sleeper.)<br />      [8] Guess what . . . you've built a finished storage bed!      Put a mattress or foam pad on top and fill the new      "cupboard" with about 30 cubic feet of whatever you'd like      to get out from under foot!    </p>
