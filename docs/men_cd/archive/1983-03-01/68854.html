                    <p>      Plant this speedy garden fruit after frost & you'll      blessed with a bountiful crop of pie-perfect berries in a      more 80 days!    </p>    <h5 id="byline">     by Nancy Pierson Farris    </h5>    <p>      When my family and I finally obtained our South Carolina      homestead, we-like many newly landed folksIssue no. 80 -      March/April 1983were eager to get some fruit trees planted.      However, price those young hardwoods were in the ground      (and looking disappointingly small and vulnerable), we were      forced to face the fact that it would be <em>years</em>      before they yielded a sizable crop. So in an effort to      hurry our production of homegrown pie makings, I set out in      search of fast-bearing alternatives ... and discovered the      garden huckleberry.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly enough, <em>Solanum melanocerasum</em> is one      of the nightshades. It seems that this little fruit, which      grows on rangy 2-1/2-foottall (or larger) plants, requires      the same horticultural techniques as does its tomato      relatives ... which the garden huckleberry resembles in      both foliage and growth characteristics. Needless to say,      the opportunity to harvest homegrown berries in one season      appealed to me ... so I dutifully sent off for some seeds      (see the accompanying access list for the names of firms      carrying S. <em>melanocerasum</em> seeds).    </p>    <p>      I timed the starting date for my huckleberries to coincide      'with that for our tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers (all      members of the nightshade family) and sowed the berry seeds      in flats, spacing them about two inches apart. Once the      resulting seedlings formed second leaves, I moved them into      peat pots . . . and, during the course of the plants'      "infancy", I made sure that each little berry-bearer      received five hours of grow-light exposure and four hours      on a south-facing windowsill daily. (I also treated the      seedlings to regular doses of the same liquid fertilizer      that I fed to my "baby" tomatoes.)    </p>    <p>      Then, about two weeks prior to my area's last projected      frost date, I hardened off the young plants by moving them      to the screened porch (I did bring the seedlings in if the      overnight temperature was predicted to drop below 45°F,      though). After the frost date had passed, I planted the      berries in various locations around my garden (to determine      whether any particular light or soil characteristics      appealed to them) and gave my surplus plants to my      mother-in-law.    </p>    <p>      I harvested only a fair crop that first year (although I      did find out that the huckleberries prefer <em>partial</em>      shade), but my mother-in-law-who set her plants in      the rich soil adjacent to her chicken yard-had fruit      to freeze, can, sell, and <em>give away.</em> So, come the      following spring, I was careful to put all of my      transplants in partial shade <em>and</em> to feed each new      garden resident ... by working a shovelful of compost into      its site be fore planting. And the extra care made a real      difference. In fact, I couldn't pick the berries fast      enough!    </p>    <h3>THE NOT-TOO-SWEET REWARDS'</h3>    <p>      Garden huckleberries <em>look</em> ripe when they turn      black and shiny (in fact, that's when I picked most of my      first year's crop), but I soon discovered that the flavor      is better after that gloss fades and the little fruits      begin to soften. (Don't expect these unusual edibles to be      as sweet as any "real" berry when eaten raw ... in fact,      many folks actually <em>can't stand</em> them fresh off the      plant, but a real culinary miracle occurs when you cook and      sweeten garden huckleberries!)    </p>    <p>      To prepare the fruits for use in most recipes, it's      necessary to subject them to heat (to soften them) and to      add about 1-1/4 cups of sugar for every four cups of raw      berries. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Sweetness is, of course, a      matter of personal taste ... and we also suspect that it      would be quite easy to substitute a lessprocessed product      for the white sugar called for in Ms. Farris's      recipes.]</em> If I'm making a pie, for instance, I first      simmer four cups of berries, with just enough water to      prevent scorching, for 20 minutes. Then I add the sugar and      four tablespoons of cornstarch or tapioca ... stir the      filling till it thickens ... remove it from the heat to      cool ... pour it into a shell ... and cover it with a top      crust. I put the pie in a 425°F oven for 10 minutes ...      then reduce the heat to 350°F and continue baking for      30 to 40 minutes, or until the top is browned. The cooked      and sweetened fruit is also delicious in pancakes, muffins,      and such.    </p>    <h3>HUCKLEBERRY FUN</h3>    <p>      After the success of my second year's crop, I found myself      with enough berries on hand to try some preservation      techniques. I found that the fruit freezes quite well if      it's first simmered for 15 minutes, then sweetened with      about 1/3 cup of sugar per quart of berries, and packed      into containers. I prefer to can my surplus, however, and      that process is simplicity itself! Just spoon the raw      berries into quart jars, add 1/3 cup of sugar to each, and      pour in boiling water, leaving one-half inch of headspace.      Then process the jars in a hotwater bath for 20 minutes.    </p>    <p>      All in all, garden huckleberries have a lot going for them.      They're easy to raise (they'll actually reseed themselves      in some areas) ... each plant can be expected to produce      enough fruit for a pie ... and they yield ripe berries      within 80 days or so after planting. What better remedy      could there be for the slowgrowing-fruit-tree blues?.    </p>
