                <p>      <em>To supply your own "garden watchdogs", two readers      suggest</em> ...    </p>        <p>      Handpicking is sometimes just too slow and time-consuming      <em>-</em> and chemical pesticides are hazardous, of      course <em>-</em> so what can the home gardener do to      prevent hordes of voracious insects from descending upon      the flowerbed or pea patch? Well, he or she can prepare for      such an attack by marching right out and getting a      biological control, that's what ... preferably one that's      just as voracious as the pests are! Something, in fact,      like the remarkable praying mantis.    </p>        <p>      Ready and willing <em>-</em> and certainly able      <em>-</em> to eat its way through crowds of the plant      <em>-</em> munching bugs that threaten your garden,      this giant (up to five-inch-long) green predator can be      brought directly to the site before birth and allowed to      hatch right in the area it will call home. All you need to      do is take a spring walk or a drive in the country, and      collect some of the egg cases produced by mother mantises      the previous year.    </p>    <h3>CHECKOUT BRIARS AND BYROADS</h3>        <p>      Mantis egg cases, or castings, are quite distinctive. Gray,      with a sort of foam/paper exterior, and shaped like a broad      cone with a flattened bottom, they're usually found      attached to twigs, branches, or briars. Sometimes the      mother insect will even glue a casting to the side of a      barn or shed where she has found plenty of food. Roadside      thickets, pasture shrubs, and fence-row tangles on farms      where no chemical pesticides have been used are also good      bets for the casting collector. North Carolinian Darrell      Dennis has found that riverside bushes are treasure-troves      in his section of the country, while <em>-</em> in      Georgia <em>-</em> reader Roy Dycus had good luck in      a farm blackberry patch.    </p>    <p>      During the months of January and February, the eggs swell      in anticipation of spring ... making the cases easy to spot      in March. When it's time to gather castings, the whole      Dycus family gets into the act: Roy drives slowly down a      country road, while the children keep a lookout for the      gray cones and call a halt when they spot some.    </p>    <p>      (The youngsters also keep their eyes peeled for returnable      cans and bottles that people have thoughtlessly dumped by      the road ... and collecting these helps the family defray      the cost of gasoline for their excursions.)    </p>    <h3>RELOCATE WITH CARE</h3>        <p>      When you discover one of the little nests, cut the twig or      branch to which it's attached, leaving about three inches      below the casting and one inch above. This stick handle can      later be inserted in the ground or into a crack in a      fencepost, or be tied to another twig. Be careful not to      damage the egg mass when you cut it free ... and be sure it      doesn't get crushed when you transport it to its new home.    </p>    <p>      To use your finds to best advantage, you'll want to      position the castings near your garden. Roy pokes the      sticks into the earth ... Darrell ties or tapes the      eggholders to posts or branches at a height of about two      feet above the ground. Either way, you should choose a      place where there's some sort of cover nearby      <em>-</em> such as leaves, straw, periwinkle,      cornstalks, or other plant material <em>-</em> that      the young bugs can hide in when they hatch. Otherwise, wild      birds, chickens, and grown-up predatory insects are likely      to find infant mantises delicious ... and you could lose      most of your "litter" if you haven't afforded the newborns      some protection.    </p>    <p>      The actual hatching date will vary from one location to      another ... and even from one season to the next in a given      place. In the southeastern United States, it will be early      in April ... if the weather's warm.    </p>    <p>      In fact, because warmth triggers the process, you should      never bring the castings indoors ... unless you want your      home full of mantis babies with little to eat except each      other! A greenhouse, however, can be a fine place to keep      the egg cases, at least according to Darrell Dennis: He      claims the little predators will emerge some two or three      weeks before their relatives in the wild. After spending      that "head start" time filling up on hothouse bugs, they'll      be larger than their later-hatching country cousins (and      have correspondingly larger appetites) when it's time to      put them outside.    </p>
