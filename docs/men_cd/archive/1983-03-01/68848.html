    <p>
                <p>      <em>There isn't an angler around (not an honest one,      anyway!) who can't use advice on how to</em> ...    </p>         <p>      An old fellow who fishes from a pier near our house claims      that he's never kept a yellow perch under eight inches      long. "Them little ones are just too much trouble," he      insists.    </p>    <p>      The same gentleman also tells me that whenever he      <em>does</em> manage to bring home some "keepers", he and      his wife usually cook them up for supper that same night .      . . but when he's had a "Bad Day at the Pier", they simply      do without their anticipated fish dinner.    </p>    <p>      Almost everyone, of course, <em>likes</em> to catch sizable      specimens ... but I, at least, can't <em>count on</em>      doing so. More often than not, big fish seem as scarce as      calm cats at a dog show ... a fact that gave rise to the      classic empty-handed angler's excuse: "All I could catch      were a bunch of little ones, and I threw them back."    </p>    <p>      <em>Threw them back!</em> How can anyone spurn such tasty      tidbits of delicious protein? I spend a lot of time angling      for trophies, but I also like to <em>eat</em> fish. So when      the big ones sulk and won't cooperate, I simply-and      often easily-harvest a batch of smaller fry for the      table.<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>LITTLE FISH, BIG REWARDS</h3>    <p>      In most waters, small bluegills (also called bream or      brim), crappie, perch, rock bass, white bass, and other pan      fish are abundant and accessible from shore, and require      little investment in time <em>or</em> equipment to catch.      What's more, gleaning some of the small fry from a lake can      often prove to be good environmental management. Pan fish      are notorious for overpopulating lakes, you see, causing      severe competition for food ... and that situation-in      turn-results in entire communities of underdeveloped      animals. By harvesting some of the little guys, then, you      give the remaining specimens a chance to mature naturally.      That's why, in many states, bag and minimum-size limits for      these species are liberal ... or nonexistent. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: Hooked and released fish are also quite likely to die      ... so, by keeping the</em> <em>fry,</em> <em>you'll be      doing your bit for conservation.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Small fish have some distinct <em>culinary</em> advantages      over their big brothers and sisters, too. They're easier to      scale and (in my opinion) to clean ... and their flesh is      more tender and flavorful. (Some people also say that you      needn't be as concerned about ingesting harmful      contaminants when you eat young specimens, because they      likely haven't had as much time to accumulate chemicals and      heavy metals in their bodies as have big "old timers"!)    </p>    <p>      In fact, even though many people-including my old      fisherman friend-believe that cleaning undersized      fish isn't worth the effort, I've found that I can slice      two 2-ounce scaleless, boneless fillets off a small crappie      in just over a minute. And in less than 15 minutes, I can      clean enough little fish (about 10) to generously feed four      adults. When you consider the relatively short time it      takes to catch (usually) and process that many small pan      fish-as compared with the effort (and luck!) required      to capture four larger specimens-the little ones      definitely come out on top.<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>KEEPING FISH FRESH</h3>    <p>      Ideally, you should dress fish as soon as you catch them.      The flesh is very fragile and-after the creatures      die-breaks down rapidly. On-site cleaning, however, is      seldom practical ... so most anglers use a cooler or some      other method (such as putting the fillets-to-be in the      shade with a damp cloth covering them) of keeping their      catch fresh.    </p>    <p>      Actually, fish that have been put on ice soon after being      landed will be easier to clean-because the meat will      be firmer and <em>will taste</em> better, too. Cold      temperatures slow bacterial growth and enzyme activity,      both of which can result in mushy, poortasting fare.    </p>    <p>      Of course, some folks keep their catch alive in      water-either on a stringer or in a bait box-and      although this is an acceptable way to maintain fresh      flavor, you should be careful not to let fish that have      <em>died</em> stand in water, because the liquid is an      excellent medium for destructive bacteria. And, for the      same reason, don't allow your quarry to rest in a puddle of      meltwater in the bottom of your cooler ... either drain the      box frequently, or use frozen water-filled plastic jugs to      keep the "fridge" cold. (The thawing ice in such containers      can provide you with a convenient, refreshing drink from      time to time, too.)<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>CLEANING TIPS</h3>    <p>      Even if they're kept on ice, fish should be processed as      soon after catching as possible. Decomposition typically      spreads from the gills and entrails outward, so-to      prevent spoilage of the meat-these organs should be      removed promptly. Some piers provide special cleaning      facilities, but most anglers simply do the job as soon as      they arrive home.    </p>    <p>      I doubt that anybody actually <em>likes</em> to clean fish,      but the job can be rendered pretty much unobjectionable. To      avoid making a mess when you scale your catch, spread a      layer of newspapers over the work area (likely the basement      or garage floor) to contain the skittering flakes, or scale      the fish in a deep sink or cardboard box. When it's time to      pan-clean or fillet the edibles, use a board or a pad of      clean newspapers as a working surface (in the latter case,      when the top layer gets goopy, you can just tear off a few      sheets).    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you have the room, you may want to set up a      cleaning area <em>outside. You</em> can build a      free-standing table or mount a plank-with a leg or      two beneath the other wise unsupported end, like an old      fold-down ironing board-from the side of a tree      or pole. The <em>best</em> tables are about waist high and      smooth, so that they can be washed off easily. And to avoid      attracting flies and animals to your dwelling, remember to      locate the cleaning station <em>away</em> from the house!    </p>    <p>      The only implements you really need to tackle this job are      a sharp, flexible filleting knife and a scaling utensil      (such as a stiffbladed knife, a spoon, or a serrated-edged      tool made expressly for the purpose). I also keep a      sharpening stone close by, and use a cotton left-handed      glove (I'm a "righty") to protect my fish-gripping hand      from sharp gill plate edges and pointy fins.    </p>    <p>      The key to getting through your processing task      <em>quickly</em> is to avoid wasted motion ... and, to that      end, it pays to carry all of the fish through one step      before proceeding to the next. (For example, scale your      entire stringerful before stopping to rinse either your      hands or the catch.) Also, once you start dressing a fish,      don't let go of it until the critter has been      <em>completely</em> filleted (or whatever). You don't have      to be a speed demon, of course, but a little smoothness and      economy of movement in your cleaning technique will make      the job much easier.<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>CLEANING METHODS</h3>    <p>      The fastest way to process small fish is to      <em>pan-dress</em> them. Simply scale each critter, cut off      its head (including the gills), slit the stomach open from      the vent forward, and remove the internal organs. The      dark-colored kidney can be pushed free by running your      thumb along the backbone. If you desire, you can also      <em>de-fin</em> the fish by making an incision along both      sides of the dorsal fin and tearing it free from back to      front. After a quick rinse under running water, your      cleaned meat is ready to be cooked. (Don't overrinse the      catch however. Water can rapidly wash the      juices-which contain the food's delicate flavor,      <em>and</em> many nutrientsfrom the flesh.)    </p>    <p>      Pan-dressing wastes virtually no meat and is an especially      efficient technique for truly small specimens such as young      perch and bluegills. Its main <em>disadvantage</em> is that      you have to pick the meat free from the bones after it's      cooked, (However, it's not difficult to remove the slabs of      meat from both sides of a cooked fish right on your plate      ... us ing a fork.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Filleting,</em> on the other hand, does leave a small      amount of flesh on the carcass. . . but it also gives you      (usually!) a boneless meal and-maybe best of      all-eliminates the need to gut or otherwise clean a      fish's body cavity. My technique works best on crappies,      white bass, and rock bass, but I've been able to carve neat      fillets from fairly small bluegills and perch, too.    </p>    <p>      When a <em>large</em> fish is processed, a fillet is      usually cut with a single sideways slice of the knife from      gill to tail ... but this particular method wastes too much      meat when used on smaller varieties. Instead, hold the      specimen with its back up and make a precise cut along one      side of the dorsal fin. Slice straight down until you feel      your knife touch bone, and then extend the cut from the      rear of the dorsal fin to the skull. Now, lay the fish on      its side and make a shallow incision around the skull and      down to the rear part of the pectoral (side) fin. And,      finally, grasp the flap of meat near the top of the fish      and peel it away from the carcass as you guide your knife      along the-rib bones. Repeat the process on the other side      of the fish ... and you'll have two ready-to-becooked      fillets.    </p>    <p>      Of course, when this technique is used on pan fish, it's      often difficult to free the meat from the forward ribs.      Small crappies and bluegills have so little flesh above      these bones, however, that I usually just cut through the      skin right at the top of the rib cage, thereby saving      myself a lot of troublesome pulling and slicing (which,      after all, would earn me only a very little extra food).      The sides of <em>perch,</em> however, are fleshy (and      delicious!) enough to warrant meticulous surgery. In any      case, the ribs on pan fish virtually disappear at a point      about an inch to an inch and a half (depending upon the      species and size of your catch) behind the gills,      so-once you get to that spot-you can simply      carve straight down the backbone to the tail.    </p>    <p>      Regardless of the technique you use, try-as you      process your catch-to salvage as <em>much</em> meat      as is practical. When you've finished cutting your first      fish, for example, examine it carefully for any pockets of      flesh that you might have missed, and try to devise a      strategy that'll let you harvest those nuggets when you      carve your <em>next</em> fish (One often neglected chunk of      meat is located on top of the backbone, just behind the      skull ... and, if you've made the cut along the base of the      skull necessary to remove this meat, the forward part of      the fillet or pan-dressed carcass should be crescent      shaped.)<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>NOW FOR THE (YUM!) EATING</h3>    <p>      Like gold, fish-even in small quantities-can be      stretched thin and still be appealing. If you don't have      enough to go around as a main course, for example, you can      flake the cooked (and cooled) meat off the bones and add it      to a salad. And small strips of fish make a wonderfully      tasty addition to stirfried dishes.    </p>    <p>      My favorite way to prepare pan-dressed or filleted fish,      however, is to coat them with a thick batter and fry them      in a little bit of cooking oil. I usually vary my recipe a      bit every time I whip up a batch, but here's one "old      standby" that's sure to please your palate:    </p>    <h3>      <em>BEER-FRIED FISH</em>    </h3>    <p>      2 pounds of filleted or pan-dressed fish<br />      1 can of warm beer<br />      1 cup of whole wheat flour<br />      1 tablespoon of pepper (or to taste)<br />      1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder<br />      salt to taste    </p>    <p>      Mix the ingredients (other than the fish) and let them      stand about 1/2 hour at room temperature until the beer      flattens. Then whisk the mixture until it's frothy ... dip      the fish in the batter (being sure to coat each piece      well), and fry them in hot oil. (Be careful not to      <em>overcook</em> your fish! Even with a heavy batter      insulation, they'll fry up incredibly fast. At medium heat,      fillets take no more than a minute on each side. Fish flesh      is thoroughly cooked as soon as it loses its transparent      quality ... any frying after that point is reached will      destroy the delicate flavor.)    </p>    <p>      Now ... enjoy your fresh fish dinner! And remember that,      the next time you suffer a Bad Day at the Pier, you can      still have a Good Meal at the Supper Table that night!    </p>
