Bennett    </h5>        <p>      While many gardeners boast of their zucchini yields or brag      about the size of their prize tomatoes, it's rare that a      green-thumber will even <em>mention another</em> staple of      the vegetable plate: celery. Most people, it seems, are so      intimidated by its reputation as a "fussy" crop that they      prefer to harvest their celery from the supermarket. And,      all too often, the enterprising folks who do attempt to      cultivate these crisp stalks find that their labors result      in a limp, discolored, and not quite <em>right</em>      -tasting product.    </p>    <p>      In fact, <em>my</em> first try at celery culture was, to be      honest, pretty disappointing ... but I've since discovered      that this succulent salad plant is downright easy to grow      as long as it's properly fed and watered. Moreover, because      celery is such a nutritious food (it's rich in phosphorus,      potassium, magnesium, and calcium ... and a good source of      roughage), it's a valuable addition to your garden plot.    </p>    <p>      Around my home (in British Columbia), the preparations for      a quality celery crop begin in late February, when I start      my plants indoors. Otis S. Twilley Seed Company, Inc.      (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 65, Trevose, Pennsylvania 19047)      markets a variety of seed called Utah 52-70, which is well      suited to the growing conditions in my area and highly      resistant to disease. The stalks of this plant have a      pleasing, nutty flavor, too. Whatever variety you choose,      though, be sure to obtain fresh seed each spring, as older      seed is often unreliable.    </p>    <p>      Using a shallow flowerpot filled with a porous mixture of      equal amounts of vermiculite and potting soil, I sow the      seeds sparsely (spacing them at least an inch apart),      gently press them into the soil, and cover them with a      1/8-inch layer of vermiculite. Next, I add water to the      pot's "dish" reservoir <em>-</em> allowing the      moisture to soak into the soil from below <em>-</em>      and cover the container with plastic wrap. Then I set the      miniature greenhouse in a spot that'll remain at      approximately 70째F.    </p>    <p>      Celery is slow to germinate it takes about three weeks for      the shoots to begin peeking through the soil. At that      signal, I remove the plastic and set the planter on a sunny      windowsill where the seedlings will ,be well ventilated and      can enjoy an even temperature of 60째F or thereabouts.      I've found that a combination of good drainage, plenty of      moisture, and cool temperatures will insure a healthy crop      ... however, it is important to keep the delicate young      sprouts from "catching cold", as they'll go to seed if left      exposed to temperatures below 50째F.    </p>    <p>      When the plants are about a month old and close to 3 inches      tall, they're ready for their first move ... to a small      flat in which they're spaced on 3-inch centers. Once the      celery plants start to shoot up in earnest, they're      transferred again, this time to a cold frame where they'll      remain until the nights are no colder than 55째F. In the      meantime, I prepare the garden for the seedlings.    </p>    <p>      As celery is an incurable "moistureholic", I choose a site      that has a ready supply of water close at hand and where      the earth has a spongelike texture. Commercial growers      plant their crops in "muck" soil, such as is found in old      bogs, that contains a generous amount of decomposed      material. The magic word for celery success you see, is      water-holding humus . . . so I select a part of my garden      that's , richly endowed with old manure, leaf mold, and      peat moss.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore <em>-</em> in addition to having an      unquenchable thirst <em>-</em> celery is a heavy      feeder, requiring ample amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus,      and potassium, as well as certain key minor nutrients.      Therefore, after I've picked out a plot with      water-retaining soil, my next priority is preparing a      proper diet for the seedlings. To provide nourishment for      my young plants, I dig compost, manure, dried blood,      bonemeal, and phosphate rock dust into the top 4 inches of      soil. (If your soil has a heavy texture, you might want to      work to a depth of as much as 14 inches, so that the plants      will be able to put out taproots more easily.)    </p>    <p>      Then, when the dark, friable earth invites planting and the      weather is warm enough (usually around June 1 in these      parts), I set out the celery seedlings. I generally allow      14 inches between the plants, but this distance could be      reduced to 6 to 10 inches if space is at a premium in your      garden (or if you're planting intensively in raised beds).      Next, I water the celery thoroughly and apply a liquid      fertilizer (such as fish emulsion or manure tea) to get the      seedlings off to a good start.    </p>    <p>      Once the plants are in place, my main concern is protecting      the crop against the garden predators that are partial to      celery <em>...</em> namely, slugs and celery worms. To      prevent these voracious pests from lunching on (and thereby      disfiguring) the stalks, I sprinkle a layer of fresh wood      ashes around the base of each plant, forming a circular      barrier about the size of a dinner plate. This technique      not only discourages slugs and other trespassers, but also      adds potash and helps to "sweeten" the soil. When hot      weather arrives, I mulch the plants with straw and spread      yet another thin blanket of ashes over the water-conserving      cover. And that's all the care the slender stalks receive      (except for periodic watering and an occasional dose of      manure tea) until mid-August <em>...</em> when I begin to      think about blanching.    </p>    <p>      This procedure, which involves keeping light from the      stalks of the plant, makes the celery tender and white. The      vegetable <em>can,</em> of course, be enjoyed green      <em>...</em> but I prefer the paler stalks, so I bleach      them.    </p>    <p>      There are several different ways to go about blanching      celery, but some are more trouble than they're worth. I      find that shading the stalks with wooden supports is      something of a chore, for example. And although the      "hilling" method of growing the plants in a trench and then      banking soil around the stalks is easily accomplished, the      celery I've blanched by this technique has invariably been      chewed by slugs, resulting in an unappetizing harvest. In      contrast, my present manner of blanching makes the stalks      both attractive and tasty.    </p>    <p>      I call my method "ordaining". I simply wrap a "clerical      collar" of tar paper around the celery stalk, covering the      vegetable from the ground to the foliage, and making      certain the paper overlaps enough to allow for the plant's      growth. (A stout rubber band holds each collar in place.)      That done, I sit back and wait for the harvest to begin.    </p>    <p>      In my area, the Utah 52-70 variety matures in      mid-September. At the beginning of the celery harvest, I      "defrock" one plant <em>-</em> exposing the clean      white interior <em>-</em> and chomp into a stalk      right there in the garden <em>...</em> and that first      crisp, nutty-flavored bite convinces me, once again, that      homegrown celery is well worth waiting for.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: You'll find more information on celery      (and dozens of other vegetables!) in THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS(restricted) A-TO-Z Home Gardener's Handbook, available at      your newsstand, or-for $3.95 plus 95 cents shipping      and handling-from Mother's Bookshelf(restricted), 105 Stoney      Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791.</em>    </p>
