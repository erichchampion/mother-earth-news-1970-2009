            		        <p>      The worldwide organization called Friends <em>of</em> the      Earth is one <em>of</em> the most effective environmental      groups in existence today, and the activities <em>of</em>      FOE-along with a broad range <em>of</em> other news      concerning ecological developments-are described each      month in its publication titled Not Man Apart. You can      become a member <em>of</em> Friends <em>of</em> the Earth,      and receive the excellent tabloid, by sending $25 ($12 for      students and retired people)-or $15 for a      subscription only-to FOE, Dept. TMEN, 1045 Sansome      Street, San Francisco, California 94111. And to increase      the reach <em>of</em> the organization's doings, we've      arranged to bring you this bi-monthly column, which is      prepared by the staff <em>of FOE/NMA.</em>    </p>    <h3>LAME DUCK STEPS ON FAMILY FARMS</h3>    <p>      Although most readers of this column likely are in favor of      alternative and small-scale farming, it's just as      true-unfortunately-that the 97th Congress, in      its final months last year, was inclined to support      corporate agriculture ... at the expense of family farms      and the public treasury.    </p>    <p>      Somehow, the Organic Farming Act-which, as we reported in      MOTHER NO. 77, would have helped those commercial growers      who wanted to make the switch to organic practices, and      also provided for further research into such techniques-got      lost in the shuffle of 1982's lameduck session. We can only      hope that the bill will fare better when it comes up before      the 98th trend Congress early this year (a letter to your      state's representatives will help bring this about!)    </p>    <p>      Yet another example of the trend toward conciliation on      Capitol Hill can be seen in the death of the venerable      Reclamation Act of 1902 ... a law which-for      decades-helped small farmers in the amid West      irrigate their land with water they couldn't otherwise      afford. Last fall, Congress changed the statute to provide      the life-giving liquid to large company farms ... at a      fraction of its actual worth. Wisconsin Democrat Senator      William Proxmire, a lonely opponent of the federal      giveaway, described the measure as "welfare for the richest      ... an unconscionable raid on the treasury". And in the      House, Democrat James Weaver of Oregon called the bill "a      bald-faced anti-family-farm package of direct subsidies to      the richest of America's agri-business interests".    </p>    <p>      Regardless of the pro-big-business mood of our      representatives, however, support for family farmers      clearly remains strong among many American citizens. In      last fall's election in Nebraska, for instance, voters      adopted a constitutional amendment-despite a media      blitz opposing the measure conducted by real estate,      insurance, and large-scale agricultural concerns-that      prohibits the purchase of farmland by non-family-farm      companies and limited partnerships. Apparently, a number of      voters felt that large corporations, many of which are      located outside the state (Pruden tial Insurance, for      example, is headquartered <em>in</em> New Jersey, yet owns      over 33,000 acres of Nebraska farmland), have no business      farming ... and particularly not when their activities      displace family-run enterprises.    </p>    <p>      Of course, there's good reason for concern over this issue.      Each of the past three decades has seen almost a million      family farmers driven out of business. And there are now      only one third as many such operations as there were in      1935. Nebraska residents moved to stop the depletion of      small farms within their boundaries ... and we think that      their action may signal similar moves in other states.    </p>    <h3>MX DEFEAT</h3>    <p>      Another encouraging development was the defeat, in      December, of a near-$1 billion appropriations bill for      production of the MX missile. By a vote of 245 to 176, the      House rejected a major weapons system for the first time      since World War II. Following the success of nuclear      weapons freeze initiatives across the country in the      November elections, "disarmamentalists" lobbied Congress      effectively, and definitely did help force the Reagan      administration to back off from its insistence on      manufacturing and deploying the weapons according to its      "dense pack" siting plan. The victory was only bittersweet,      however ... Congress still approved $2.5 billion for      "development" of the MX. In other words, research will      proceed, but-for the time being, at      least-production of the missiles will not.    </p>    <h3>THE BREEDER SURVIVES (BARELY, AGAIN)</h3>    <p>      Congress also found room in its busy lameduck session to      discuss the future of the yet-to-be-built Clinch River      Breeder Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. As you may recall      from our mention of the project in the last issue of      MOTHER, the intended plutoniumproducing power plant escaped      elimination from the budget in September by only one vote.      Well, in December-like a political cat with nine      lives-it again narrowly survived Congress. Early in      the month, the House voted <em>against</em> funding the      project, but the Senate voted otherwise (again by a margin      of just one ballot), and a conference committee restored      the monies. It's not all smooth sailing for the breeder,      yet, however ... the agreement also banned any new      construction on the reactor, and called for a study to      determine the project's validity.    </p>    <h3>GO-AHEAD ON WASTE DISPOSAL</h3>    <p>      Although legislators were of two minds about the      breeder-the Senate for and the House against-they      acted single-mindedly when it came to the problem of      radioactive materials disposal ... and <em>passed</em> the      Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The bill provides for the      construction of "temporary" repositories for high-level      nuclear waste and spent fuel ... establishes a program to      research-and, by the year 2000, build-a      permanent underground "dump" . . . and, for the first time,      gets the government into the commercial waste disposal      business. Although the act was backed by long-time      conservationist Morris Udall of Arizona, most environmental      groups opposed it, objecting to the federal subsidy of      commercial nuclear power-which is what government      takeover of utility waste disposa amounts to-and to      provisions that can prevent states from refusing to store      radioactive trash within their boundaries.    </p>    <p>      Even now, many states object to the disposal of such      materials within their borders. Two years ago, for example,      Montana voters banned the practice in their state ... and      when the legislature later attempted to amend the law to      allow the dumping of uranium mill tailings, the citizenry      rejected that proposal, as well.    </p>    <p>      Likewise, last fall voters in Massachusetts approved an      initiative preventing the construction of nuclear power      plants or waste disposal sites without prior voter      approval. The measure puts their legislature in an      uncomfortable bind, too, because Massachusetts belongs to a      consortium of New England states that's trying to decide      how and where to dump the region's radioactive rubbish. The      other members of the organization are now threatening to      expel the Bay State, since the referendum essentially      disqualifies it as a possible site.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, as legislators at all levels become more and      more embroiled in the problem, voters are becoming less and      less sympathetic to the idea of living near nuclear      detritus. The conflict over how and where to dump such      radioactive material will undoubtedly heat up ... and, like      the waste itself, the debate will likely be with us for a      long, long time.    </p>    <p>      THREE-MILE MADNESS    </p>    <p>      Since we're on the subject of contentious nuclear issues,      it'd be hard <em>not</em> to mention the builders and      operators of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, who      are now wrangling with one another over just who, exactly,      should take the <em>blame</em> for the reactor's troubles.    </p>    <p>      General Public Utilities, the parent company of TMI      operator Metropolitan Edison, has filed a $4 billion suit      against the plant's designer, the Babcock and Wilcox      Company, charging B & W with "corporate misconduct" and      "reckless indifference" in failing to keep the utility      informed of problems in the reactor's design. Babcock and      Wilcox, meanwhile, has returned the charges, blaming GPU      for "negligence and recklessness and, in certain respects,      deliberate and willful misconduct".    </p>    <p>      Lawyers are already sharpening their pencils and their wits      for what promises to be a long battle.    </p>
