                		<p>		THE PET TEST		</p>        <p>      <em>Back in No. 52, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) published      an article by Kansas veterinarian Randy Kidd on how to      restrain a farm animal. Little did we (or Randy) know that      the one piece would lead to many more ... yet very few      issues of MOTHER since then</em> haven't <em>carried a      feature by Dr. Kidd on some facet of livestock care.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Well, "MOM's medicine man" has decided to concentrate      (for the next six issues, at least) on pets, the very      special creatures that we humans</em> - <em>for      centuries</em> - <em>have welcomed into our homes and      hearts. We hope that our readers will find Dr. Kidd's      columns on this subject to be as informative and      enlightening as have been his commonsense articles on      livestock.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Randy Kidd</h5>    <p>      For years, the domestic canine has been referred to as      "man's best friend" . . . a phrase that sums up how the      millions of dog owners in this country feel about their      chosen animal companions. There are, however, other folks      who'd take exception to this accolade and argue that the      family cat, or horse, or even snake or rat is more entitled      to be called the king (or queen) of pets.    </p>    <p>      Actually, it doesn't really matter which critter you think      is Numero Uno in the animal kingdom ... because the fact is      that a pet-any pet-can have a very positive      impact on you, <em>and</em> upon your personal health.      Recent studies have shown that stroking a dog or a      cat-or even simply watching fish cruise about an      aquarium-can lower a person's blood pressure. (Of      course, pet petting is merely a transitory way of reducing      blood pressure. It's by no means a substitute for such      healthful practices as a good diet and exercise!)    </p>    <p>      In addition to providing this sort of soothing effect, pets      have been used in programs of therapy for schizophrenics,      handicapped folks, and the elderly. In essence, however,      such "new" medical announcements are only documenting what      humankind has instinctively known all along: Pets are more      than a luxury ... to many people, they're downright      <em>necessary</em> for happiness and wellbeing.    </p>    <p>      Because of all the benefits that animals have to offer, I      believe every family should have a pet of some kind.      Unfortunately, though, not every household      <em>deserves</em> one. In order to avoid people/pet      mismatches-and to give the unwary some idea of the      financial, emotional, and time commitments required by a      four-footed (more or less) friend-I've devised a "pet      test". Imagine a prospective new resident in your home      asking these questions. If your household flunks the test,      perhaps you should wait awhile before getting an animal ...      or consider one of the less demanding beasts.    </p>    <h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>    <p>      <em>1. Will I have a comfortable bed?</em>    </p>    <p>      Most critters-except for humans-spend much of      their time sleeping. For example, my Australian shepherd      Dufus spends a good 80% of his supposedly awake time either      thinking about sleep or stretching after a snooze. All of      this gives him-I figure-a perday average of      less than three hours of (fairly) wide-awake time. And      compared with some animals, Dufus is a live wire.    </p>    <p>      Given such heavy sleep demands, then, a comfortable bed for      your pet is a must. In choosing its location, however, be      aware that what may be an ideal spot for your Siberian      husky's siesta may not be the coziest perch for a cat nap.      Aside from the obvious consideration of the size of the      bed, you should also be aware that a thickfleeced pooch      will probably be happiest in cool (or even airconditioned)      sleeping quarters ... while a kitty or a thin-coated toy      Manchester terrier will likely want to snuggle in the      warmest place in the house.    </p>    <p>      A dog, unless it's a particularly sparse-coated breed, will      probably fare quite well sleeping in an outdoor shelter. Do      be sure, though, that the doghouse is up and off the chill      ground, is water- and windtight, and offers some insulation      from both winter's extreme weather and summer's heat. Also,      bear in mind that although a canine cottage ought to be big      enough to turn around and flop down in, it should be small      enough to help keep Fido warm by retaining some of the      animal's body heat.    </p>    <p>      When your dog or cat comes into <em>your</em> house, make      certain that the critter knows where "its" place is. It      doesn't hurt a bit to train your pet to stay in one area      ... preferably a draft-free, cozy, padded spot where the      animal will be out of the main household traffic pattern      yet can still observe the goings-on of its family.    </p>    <p>      <em>2. Will I have enough "turf"?</em>    </p>    <p>      All animals are territorial ... that is, each one blocks      out the space that it "owns" and will instinctively defend      this parcel of real estate (often viciously) to the bitter      end. In the wild, animals mark and defend their territory      ... in "civilization", it's up to the owner to      <em>help</em> the pet establish its claim.    </p>    <p>      For an in-house pet, turf is easily defined ... it's      confined within the building's walls. However, when the      inside critter goes out, it'll need human protection to      make sure it doesn't become embroiled in a turf spat with a      neighboring animal. Because of the unnaturally crowded      conditions under which most of us live, our pets are often      forced to deal with overlapping territories ... and that's      where trouble sometimes begins.    </p>    <p>      It's the owner's responsibility, then, to see that his or      her animal doesn't get into such face-saving entanglements.      The best tiff-preventer is a leash ... don't leave home      without it. The secondbest peace enforcer is a fence. If      you decide that a barrier is the answer to your dog's      sparring, though, I hope you'll have better luck in keeping      your pooch in, and your neighbors' beasts out, than my      family has had. I've known dogs to jump eight-foot cyclone      fences, tunnel under two feet of buried concrete, and chew      through steel gates! Some canines simply can't be      adequately contained by fences when their amorous blood      starts to flow.    </p>    <p>      <em>3. Will I get the correct schooling?</em>    </p>    <p>      Not all pets are meant to be Ph.D. (Pleasing all Human      Demands) candidates, but every critter-companion does      deserve to receive at least the basic training it'll need      to survive. Admittedly, a caged bird doesn't require much      information from its humans, but a canine must soon learn      that it's no match for a ton of steel barreling along at 55      MPH. A dog, forced to exist in a people-oriented      environment, has to acquire some social graces as well,      such as knowing its toilet is not the new cream-colored rug      or your child's sandbox ... that it's not supposed to jump      up on Aunt Mabel (and her silk dress) with muddy paws ...      and that chickens-or the neighbors' cats-are      not play objects to be chased (or consumed).    </p>    <p>      Training does, of course, take some time ... and if someone      in your household can't devote the hours needed, your      family will be better off with the kind of pet-such      as a goldfish or guinea pig-that can exist quite well      without becoming socialized.    </p>    <p>      <em>4. Will I have proper health care?</em>    </p>    <p>      Obviously, pets aren't automatically covered by health      insurance plans like Medicare or Blue Cross ... so the      owner's pocketbook will bear the brunt of keeping the      family's four-legged friend hale and hearty. And although      there are ways to keep your animal's health care costs to a      minimum (prevention, as always, is the least expensive      "cure"), it's not unreasonable to figure on a $75 to $100      bill per year to cover routine visits to the veterinarian      ... and that's in addition, of course, to the costs of      feed, collars, leashes, litter boxes, shampoos, grooming,      and what have you. So if this figure would create a deficit      rivaling the national debt in your family's budget, you'd      better think twice (or <em>thrice)</em> before you bring a      pet home.    </p>    <p>      <em>5. Will I eat properlly?</em>    </p>    <p>      A good diet is absolutely essential to your pet's health.      These days, there's a prepared kibble or chow available for      just about any sort of animal, and it is possible to meet      the nutritional needs of your particular beast with      ready-made meals ... or you can prepare the pet rations      yourself. There are advantages and disadvantages to either      feeding method ... and the entire subject of animal      nutrition is so important that I'll devote a future column      to discussing the topic more thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      <em>6. Will I be a mother/father?</em>    </p>    <p>      Neither a puppy nor a kitten realizes what it means to be a      parent, yet when it becomes necessary, the mature      animal-prompted by nature-will usually be able      to take care of its youngsters.    </p>    <p>      However, there are some questions that the pet's human      "parents" should ask themselves before the blessed event is      even a glimmet in Fido's or Puss's eyes: How many pets does      this household want and how many animals can it afford?      Will we be able to find good homes for any "extra"      offspring, no matter how large the lit ter? Are the family      members willing to take the time and effort that's needed      to care for a gaggle of babies? In other words, the owner      must do some hard thinking about pet parenting      <em>before</em> it's time to boil the water. (I'll be      covering <em>this</em> topic in more depth in at upcoming      column, too.)    </p>    <p>      <em>7. Will I get enough love and attention?</em>    </p>    <p>      This is the last-but certainly not the least      important-question prospective pet should ask its      prospective owner. In return for all the unquestioning love      ... for all the enjoyment a family can receive ... and for      all the tangible benefits (such as improved personal      health, property security, predator control, and others)      that a pet can provide, the animal has a right to expect a      good measure of respect and affection. Again, this will      take some time on your part ... but the value of every      minute spent will be returned to you hundredfold!    </p>    <h3>DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS</h3>    <p>      <em>Most people probably think of a dog as the ideal pet,      but a pooch doesn't necessarily fit into every household.      In fact, the qualities that endear our canine cousins to      one person - such as their total devotion and      loyalty, their tail-wagging enthusiasm, and their almost      insatiable need for attention-may be the very traits that      make a dog an inappropriate choice for another. Perhaps      this second individual prefers a pet that is quiet, doesn't      fawn, and generally stays out of the way. If so, he or she      obviously should consider a cat, not a dog.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Personal situations can also enter into the decision.      For example, someone who lives in a small apartment      couldn't manage a team of sled dogs, nor would a family      whose members are away from the house all day and go on      frequent vacations want a pet that needs a lot of      attention. Instead, an animal that requires minimal care      and limited quarters</em> - <em>say, a bird, a fish,      a rodent, or a reptile</em> - <em>might be the      answer.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I'll never forget one</em> of <em>my clients who owned      a very friendly white rat named Elmo. Elmo's mistress was a      hardworking woman whose job kept her away from the house      for long hours nearly every day. She and her husband were      divorced, and the last</em> of <em>the children had left      for college ... so Elmo was the only living thing she had      at home.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And Elmo, she claimed, knew exactly when she arrived      home from work, told her when he was hungry, and was far      more capable of affection than her former husband had been!      Therefore, despite my careful explanation that Elmo's      normal life span could be only another year or two at best,      the woman had me remove several large tumors that afflicted      her little friend three times in one year.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Now with all the money she spent on that surgery, my      client could probably have bought 100 new white rats, but      she wouldn't hear</em> of <em>that. Elmo had simply been      too good a companion for her ... a fact which serves to      demonstrate that</em> any <em>pet</em> - <em>no      matter what kind it is</em> - <em>can be a beneficial      member of a loving and caring household</em> <em>.</em>    </p>
