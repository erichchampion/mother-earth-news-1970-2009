            		        <p>      Spring's bright march steals northward, with shining      columns of nodding yellow daffodils and cheerful squadrons      of chirping birds heralding its regal approach. As the      winter-chilled soil thaws and March's soaking curtain of      rain abates, it's time to turn the slumbering earth once      again and start to sow the coming summer's riches.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Peter Hemingson    </h5>        <p>      Picnic lovers cheered when the first "extra sweet" corn      varieties were introduced a few years back. And competition      being what it is, a large number of the sugary cultivars      were soon being offered. with many of them widely promoted      in the press. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that      ... except that with quantity came contusion: Some      cultivars needed to be isolated from others ... some had a      poor germination rate ... and some would sprout at 55°      F, while others needed soil 10° warmer. So, when      deciding what to plant in my own garden this year, I began      to look into the similarities and differences. As a result,      here <em>-</em> in plenty of time for corn planting      across most of the nation <em>-</em> is MOTHER's      Guide to the Super-Sweets.<br />      <br />      Currently, there are four major types of      sweeter-than-normal corn available: the original      shrunken-gene variety, the exotic-gene hybrid, the      heterozygous cultivars, and the homozygous types. The      shrunken gene (named after the shriveled look it imparts to      seeds) is usually abbreviated "sh 2 ". A recessive gene, it      was first incorporated into sweet corn varieties at the      University of Illinois back in the 1950's ... which      accounts for such names as Illini Extra Sweet and Illini      Chief.<br />      <br />      Corn with the sh2 gene converts its sugar into starch much      more slowly than do normal varieties, and the kernels can      contain up to twice as much sucrose. The slow conversion of      all that sweetness into starch means that sh, cultivars      will remain in peak condition on the stalk far longer than      will ordinary corn, and stay sweeter even after picking.      (in fact, the usual claim made for sh2 hybrids is that the      ears are twice as sweet as usual types when they are picked      ... and four times as sweet two days after picking!)<br />      <br />      There are a couple of minor drawbacks to the sh2 cultivars,      though. First, germination of the shrunken-gene types is      relatively poor in cold soils, so you'll need to wait until      your garden is thoroughly wormed <em>-</em> the soil      temperature should be 65°F or better <em>-</em>      before planting. Second, since the shrunken gene is      recessive, cross-pollination of an sh 2 cultivar with a      "regular'' variety masks the effect of the sweetening gene,      and can actually result in kernels that are as tasteless as      field corn. For this reason, all sh 2 varieties must be      isolated from regular cultivars ... by either time or      distance.<br />      <br />      Generally, it's thought that a difference of ten days in      the ripening of pollen is enough to keep the two types from      crossing, so sh 2 if you want to plant both Seneca Chief (a      regular 85-day hybrid) and Illini Chief (an 85-day sh 2      hybrid), you'll have to delay planting one or the other by      ten days.<br />      <br />      The other method of isolation is physical: Simply plant the      sh 2 hybrid far enough from any other stand of corn      (including the neighbors'!) to prevent cross-pollination      from occurring. And how far is that? Well, that'll depend      upon the layout of your garden, the prevailing winds, and      other variables. I've seen distances between 400 feet and      1,500 feet mentioned ... but you can tell only by      experimentation.<br />      <br />      The second type of super-sweet corn-instead of relying on      the shrunken gene for its extra sweetness-gets its sugary      quality from the presence of three "exotic" genes, known as      "ae" (amylose extender), du (dull gene), and "wx" (waxy).      So far, there's only one cultivar in this category: Agway's      Pennfresh ADX which-like the sh 2 cultivars-is sweeter than      ordinary kinds at harvest and holds its sweetness better,      on or off the stalk.<br />      <br />      The third category is something of a catchall, uniting      various kinds of crosses under one imposing term:      heterozygous hybrids. This two-dollar word simply means      that one of each hybrid's two parent lines contained an      extra-sweet gene of some kind. In fact, a subcategory in      this group is composed of crosses between sh 2 varieties      and regular cultivars. Employing a new breeding procedure,      such crosses can be made to produce a hybrid in which 25%      of the kernels are super-sweet and 75% are of regular      sweetness. The result is an ear that's about 50% sweeter      than ordinary hybrid sweet corn.    </p>    <p>      Another heterozygous subgroup comprises cultivars that have      one parent with what is known as the sugar enhancer, or -      se", gene. All the kernels in these cultivars are sweeter      than those of regular hybrids, but none of them is as sweet      as the sh 2 types. (Some folks find the shrunken-gene      varieties cloying and prefer the reduced sweetness of the      se hybrids.) The se heterozygous hybrids do have some      distinct advantages: They don't need to be isolated from      other cultivars; ... they display good germination and cold      tolerance ... and their kernels have a very tender      pericarp, or skin. One group of se cultivars, developed and      patented by Charter Research and the Musser Seed Company,      are known as the Everlasting Heritage (EH) hybrids and      share the advantages of their se brethren. (Kandy Korn is      perhaps the best known of the EH varieties.)    </p>    <p>      The fourth category is composed of what are known as      homozygous hybrids ... which means that both of the parent      lines, not just one, have enhanced-sugar traits. These      varieties share the se-hybrid advantages, but are-if      anything-sweeter than their cousins. The homozygous hybrids      are still very new, and only a few (Double Delight from      Comstock, Ferre & Co. and Miracle from Farmer Seeds)      have reached the market. Within the next few years,      however, these will be joined by Double Treat, Double      Delicious, and Remarkable.<br />      <br />      And now that you understand the abilities and limitations      of the super-sweet varieties, take a look at the chart and      pick the ones that are best for your garden. Good eating!    </p>
