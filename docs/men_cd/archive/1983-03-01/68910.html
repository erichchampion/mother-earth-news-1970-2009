                <p>      <strong>HOME GROWN MUSIC</strong>    </p>           <p>      Marc Bristol-a homegrown musician who performs      regularly throughout the Pacific Northwest-began      sharing his knowledge of do-it-yourself entertainment with      <em>MOTHER</em> readers back in issue 50. Marc's columns      have touched on everything from access information for      recorded music to detailed instructions on how to make your      own instruments. Marc is interested in hearing any      suggestions, comments, or questions you may have about the      subject of do-it-yourself music, and he'll try to write      about requested topics in future columns. Address your      correspondence-for this column and this column      only-to Marc Bristol, Dept. <em>T</em> <em>MEN, P.O.      Box 25</em> , Duvall Washington 98019.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Marc Bristol</h5>    <p>      Well, folks, I've finally hit one of the "keynotes" of my      musicmaking career. Not only is my book, Homegrown      <em>Music,</em> at the printer right this very minute [to      order your copy from Mother's Bookshelf (restricted) , see page      126], but my original album, entitled This Feelin', is at      long last finished and ready to be heard! And I'll tell you      right now, it wasn't easy getting all my tunes down on      cassette ... but it sure was fun!    </p>    <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>    <p>      Before producing <em>This</em> Feelin', I'd had practically      no recording experience at all (with my own or anyone      else's material). Oh, I had made a few cuts with the Okie      Doke Band (the group I play with most often), but I'd been      limited to performing my original songs solo and live (as      opposed to with a backup for a recording). So, as you'd      likely imagine, I had a lot to learn. For one thing, I had      no idea how to arrange music-that is, to put all the      vocals and instrumentals together-and I couldn't      afford to hire a professional to do the job, either.      Therefore, I knew right away that I was going to have to      rely pretty heavily on my own skill-and      intuition-to see myself through (as well as on the      help of the folks I chose to play backup on the album).    </p>    <p>      So keeping all this in mind-plus my inability to      schedule much rehearsal time be. fore the first recording      session-I proceeded to try to find a seasoned,      talented, and creative group of fellow musicians to help me      out! And after some scouting, I did manage to put just such      a band together. Some of the group were members of the Okie      Dokes ... others I'd known from living room jam sessions .      . . and the rest I'd located by attending open-mike      sessions in local commercial establishments.    </p>    <h3>GETTING INTO IT</h3>    <p>      Once we began our limited practice sessions, I was amazed      at how well we all worked together. There was constant give      and take ... with one person, say, doing a rhythm lick      while another took the spotlight and did a "fill" (a short      lyrical run played during an appropriate break in the main      melody). We jelled so well, in fact, that after a while it      became apparent that we really didn't <em>need</em> a      professional arranger. So I simply chose whichever      instruments I wanted for each tune (of course, I didn't      make my picks without a good deal of input from the      <em>rest</em> of the band), and then I let the musicians      decide on their own parts. Surprisingly enough, we got      along just fine as ensemble arrangers!    </p>    <p>      As you can imagine, it didn't take me long-to realize just      how lucky I was to have real professionals working with me,      because-as it turned out-we ended up recording      most of the album live (so to speak). In other words,      rather than trying, to lay down a separate track for each      instrumental or vocal part-for later overdubbing (a      process that can take <em>hours</em> ) and mixing (refining      sounds to get an even quality)-we tried to get down      as much of the <em>whole group</em> sound on one track as      we could. This way, we usually had to worry only about      mixing.    </p>    <p>      Of course, one of the main reasons we taped this way was      financial ... since it helped avoid much of the cost that      would normally be added by dubbing. As you're probably      aware, most recording studios charge anywhere from a low of      around $25 to well over $200 an hour for the use of their      equipment ... so, realizing that 60 minutes adds up      <em>fast,</em> I figured we needed to make the      <em>most</em> of our studio time.    </p>    <p>      Besides, once we became involved in the taping, we actually      began to enjoy ourselves, because we felt the special      exhilaration that occurs when everyone is concentrating and      working off-and with-each other. And I believe that this      feeling of excitement carried through to the finished album      ... giving it an honest, natural quality that might well      have been lost through extensive (and expensive!)      overdubbing.    </p>    <p>      At one point, I even tried to avoid further cost by      attempting to put down a tune that wouldn't need future      mixing. But let me warn you, if you use this technique (      <em>and I don't advise it</em> ), you're going to have to      rely pretty heavily on having a good engineer in the booth      ... one who has a solid understanding of electronics plus a      ready ability to blend different sounds (at the moment when      he or she hears them), and a keen awareness of what your      music is all about. After this one experiment, I reverted      to mixing <em>after</em> (not during) taping: The      additional cost was well worth it!    </p>    <h3>TROUBLE SPOTS</h3>    <p>      Of course, we did run into some unforeseen problems during      our taping, and one of the most difficult to deal with was      loss of enthusiasm for a song. This occurred when we were      forced to play the same tune over a number of times.      Suddenly the solos would lose their sparkle, and      <em>more</em> mistakes (rather than fewer) would start to      crop up. To remedy this situation, I did what most      professionals have done for years ... which was to make      block diagrams for each musician that charted every chord      (measure by measure) of a number <em>and gave</em> the      exact order of the solos. That way, each person knew      <em>-ahead of</em> time-when he or she was supposed to do      what. The charts worked, too ... and pretty soon we were      able to get a song down in only one or two takes, rather      than 10 or 20!    </p>    <p>      The most annoying <em>technical</em> difficulty we had to      contend with was leakage (when. sound from one instrument      bleeds into the mike of another in the same room). In      general, we kept this problem under control by being      careful of where we all sat and how far from the      instruments we placed the mikes. The studio was also      equipped with two isolation booths (closet-sized rooms with      sliding glass doors) to cut down on leakage still further.      I usually stood in one booth and played my guitar and sang,      while the bass player generally used the other. (When we      employed a drummer on a tune, we let him take over a booth      ... since the sounds of his instruments, obviously, were      the most likely to leak!) A musician standing in one of      these spaces could still see to get visual cues, but the      "boxed in" players <em>were</em> forced to get used to      wearing headphones in order to hear what was going on. In      general, though, the booths-combined with our careful      attention to seating and microphone placement-proved to be      adequate solutions to the leakage problem.    </p>    <h3>"IT'S A PEACEFUL EASY FEELIN"</h3>    <p>      I wish I had the space to pass on ev ery thing I learned in      making my album, but some things you'll just have to      discover when you try to do the same yourself. I'll close      by saying that-if you are thinking making our own      recording-don't be couraged by how complicated and ex sive      the whole process appears to be fro the outside. Because if      you arrange your own material ... enlist talented musicians      to back you up ... and maintain a strong determination to      work hard at making sure the final sound is just what you      want, then- once you're <em>inside</em> the      studio-you'll find that creating a tape in a      professional situation can feel just as natural and      laid-back as jamming with friends in your own room. (And      wouldn't it be nice if you, too could capture <em>This</em>      <em>Feelin' on</em> your homegrown album?)    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE.
