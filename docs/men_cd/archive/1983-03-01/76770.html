                   <p>      <em>In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of humankind's better ideas</em> -      <em>barter</em> - <em>and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied ... and announced our      still-standing offer. Anyone who sends us a short account,      of an actual barter, that gets printed in this column      (write Successful Swaps, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) 105      Stoney Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791)      will receive a 12-month subscription (new or extended) to      MOTHER.</em>    </p>    <p>      My wife and I are, exceedingly fond of perennials-the      iris is our <em>special</em> favorite-and we used to      spend many hours in the early spring, poring over seed      catalogs and wishing we could afford to purchase the many      beautiful varieties available. Unfortunately, it would have      cost a small fortune to buy all of our choices in one      season, so we resigned ourselves to dreaming. This year      however, we were able to make those fantasies come      true-and triple our perennial bed-through      bartering.    </p>    <p>      The farm on which we live, at one time a country squire's      estate, has thousands of daffodils arranged in formal and      naturalized beds. Years of neglect had led to overcrowding,      though, and the plants had to be thinned if they were to      bloom. After digging the beds, replanting, and giving away      bulbs to a local park and various friends, my wife realized      that we <em>still</em> had more than enough for the      property. So she took out an ad in the county newspaper      proposing a "perennial swap".    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly, many of the responses were from people who      invited us to thin <em>their</em> perennial beds in      exchange for all the bulbs we wanted. We were delighted to      oblige, and everything worked out <em>beautifully:</em>      Overcrowded gardens were restored health, while we reaped a      supply of irises, grape hyacinths, and lilies in exchange      for only a few hours of digging. In short, barter turned a      garden chore into a plant bonanza for us!    </p>    <p>      <strong>M.M.<br />      New Jersey</strong>    </p>    <p>      I've found swapping to be a natural way of doing business,      and I remember-with pleasure-such trades as a      peacock for a canary . . . a milking doe for a heifer calf      ... and a runt pig that was given to me as a kind of "thank      you" for friendship.    </p>    <p>      This past summer, however, I arranged my first      <em>ongoing</em> swap. When my lawn mower broke down, I      discovered that it would be less expensive to hire a helper      to cut the grass than to overhaul (or replace) the aging      trimmer. Initially, I assumed I'd have to pay a worker by      the hour ... however, while chatting with my prospective      employee, I found out that he had a hankering to take his      son camping but couldn't afford to <em>buyor</em>      rent-the necessary equipment.    </p>    <p>      Well, I just happened to have accumulated a good bit of      outdoor gear over the years, and much of it was lying idle      in the attic. A trade was effected, and in exchange for the      loan of my tent, canoe, paddles, life jackets, and outdoor      cooking gear, I got one month's mowing ... plus the      satisfaction of knowing my equipment was helping someone      else enjoy the beauty and excitement of the wilderness.    </p>    <p>      <strong>C.S.<br /></strong> <strong>Indiana</strong>    </p>    <p>      Back in 1981, I started my own part-time bootstrap      business: "The Balloon Shoppe" delivers inflated bouquets      for birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, and other special      occasions.    </p>        <p>      Recently, though, a traffic accident left my delivery van      with a broken windshield and a bent window frame,      and-when I checked at a local body shop-I found that      repairs would be quite expensive. I decided to propose a      swap, and since it was then the second week in February, I      asked the shop owner what he planned to give his wife for      Valentine's Day. He hadn't thought about it at all, so I      suggested a beautiful balloon bouquet ... which, together      with a small amount of cash, he accepted in trade for      repairs on the van. That balloon/body-work barter made a      happy holiday for <em>all</em> of us!    </p>    <p>      <strong>G.M.<br />      North Carolina</strong>    </p>    <p>      With four children to feed and clothe, my husband and I      settled into an economical, yet comfortable, mobile home      and began to develop a back-to-basics lifestyle. We now      grow our own (sumptuous!) vegetables, and I make clothes      for the youngsters on an old -but serviceable-sewing      machine.    </p>    <p>      In order to earn extra money, however, I decided to put my      degree in accounting to work by offering to prepare income      tax returns for people in the area.    </p>    <p>      It was easy enough to establish a fair price for my      services ... but it soon occurred to me that what I really      needed wasn't money so much as fabric to make our family's      garments, and equipment and supplies for cultivating and      preserving our produce. With this in mind-and      operating on the principle that word-of-mouth advertising      was in keeping with our lifestyle-I contacted some      people who might want my assistance and could, in exchange,      supply the items I needed. The response was phenomenal: It      seemed as though everyone had just been <em>waiting</em>      for somebody to offer a swap!    </p>    <p>      An old friend in the fabric business ... a retired sewing      Machine repairman ... people who could do tilling in the      spring ... plumbers ... carpenters ... and more were soon      arranging swaps with me. I found that retired folks, in      particular, were storehouses of skills and services ... and      were <em>glad</em> to barter for them. Now, I don't have to      contact anyone: People call me every year to "work out a      swap".    </p>    <p>      <strong>R.W.M.<br />      Iowa</strong>    </p>    <p>      As a lifelong country dweller, I've always been involved in      bartering. However, inspired by your Successful Swaps      tales, my family recently made some exchanges that were      larger and more imaginative than usual.    </p>    <p>      [1] Our sheep ranch is located in the windswept hills along      the Wyoming/Color-do border. Wildlife abounds in the      region, and-because of the terrain <em>and</em> the      abundance of rabbits-the area is ideal for hunting      with falcons. Therefore, for a few weeks every year,      several enterprising easterners now trade their      labor-about six hours a day helping with the      chores-for room (a sheep wagon), board, and a place      to fly their magnificent birds.    </p>    <p>      [2] A few years ago we acquired some komondor livestock      guard dogs to protect out lambs from predators. Our      neighbors, a young couple who raise purebred Ranibouillets,      admired the dogs, so we recently proposed a swap: a      registered komondor puppy, who'd been raised with lambs,      for two of their top-quality Rambouillet rams.    </p>    <p>      [3] Last year I lost my "good right arm". my herding      sheepdog. And since I think a dependable canine is a      necessity when handling a flock, I've been on the lookout      for a replacement ... but until a few weeks ago, I couldn't      find one that had what it takes. Then an old friend from      college called me. Lo and behold, she now raises border      collies! Before the phone call was over, wed negotiated a      swap: a butchered lamb-cut, wrapped, and      frozen-for one of the puppies. In addition, I agreed      to peddle the rest of a litter in our area ... while she      sold my frozen lamb to her urban neighbors.    </p>    <p>      Everyone's opportunities are unique, but one thing's for      sure: No matter how isolated your home may seem, there's      always an opening for barter!    </p>    <p>      <strong>S.S.O.<br />      Colorado</strong>    </p>
