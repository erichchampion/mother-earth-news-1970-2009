                <p>      <em>Without dangerous chemicals in our water</em>      <em>supplies ... life itself might continue to be<br />      possible.</em>    </p>            <p>      As William Ashworth so aptly put it in his book <em>Nor Any      Drop to Drink</em> (see MOTHER NO. 79, page 190 for an      excerpt from that volume), "We are not destroying our      water; but we are rendering it unusable, which amounts to      the same thing." And clearly, one of the greatest threats      to our ability to assure ongoing and adequate supplies of      clean water is the increasing presence of toxic elements      and compounds in those precious resources.    </p>    <p>      In order to understand the scope of the problem, it's      necessary to realize that the General Accounting Office      (GAO) has stated that 43% of community water systems in the      U.S. violated safe drinking standards in 1981. Now      <em>many</em> of those problems no doubt were biological in      nature, but at least as many likely involved a toxic metal      or chemical. Worse yet, of the 146,000 recorded violations,      only 16,000 were properly reported to the public (as is      required by law). And lest <em>country</em> folk feel too      secure with their private wells, Cornell University      reported last year that approximately 39,000,000 rural      citizens are drinking unsafe water. And, of that sample,      17% reportedly were exposed to dangerous concentrations of      the extremely toxic heavy metals lead and cadmium.    </p>    <p>      Of course, many people are aware of the well-publicized      water quality problems that have cropped up in some parts      of New Jersey and were created by leaks from hazardous      waste dumps. But the lack of publicity given to      <em>other</em> contaminated wells hides the fact that water      pollution is playing no regional favorites. From the 39      wells closed in the San Gabriel Valley in California      because levels of trichloroethylene (TCE, a carcinogen and      toxicant) reached 600 parts per billion (PPB) ... to      nitrate contamination from fertilizer runoff and feedlot      leaks in Nebraska ... to a well in Pennsylvania that was      actually measured at 27,300 PPB <em>of      trichloroethylene,</em> water pollution is a national      (indeed, a worldwide) problem.    </p>    <h3>WHERE DOES YOUR WATER COME FROM?</h3>    <p>      In general, potable water is extracted either from surface      supplies (lakes and rivers) or from ground water (which      lies below the earth's surface and either rises by      hydrostatic pressure <em>-</em> as in artesian wells      <em>-</em> or must be pumped out). These two sources      interact in sometimes complicated ways: Ground water, for      instance, may help to fill lakes and rivers ... or the      lakes and rivers may slowly recharge ground-water supplies.      The mapping of such exchanges is probably best left to      trained hydrologists, but there are a few important basic      differences that you should understand.    </p>    <p>      Water in streams takes about two weeks (on the average) to      make its journey from the headwaters to the ocean, while      lakes hold a portion of their rainfall somewhat longer ...      but <em>ground water</em> may be in place for thousands of      years, and generally moves at an annual pace of less than      ten feet. For that reason, contaminants can remain present      at high concentrations long after entering ground water.    </p>    <p>      Yet another important characteristic of ground water is      that this liquid is actually contained <em>within</em> rock      and/or sediments, and therefore receives considerable      filtration. (The image of underground rivers is accurate      only in the loosest sense ... cavities filled with water      actually are quite rare.) This filtration effectively      eliminates biological hazards, but it's far less successful      at stopping toxic chemicals. In fact, some particularly      volatile synthetic organic substances (trichloroethylene is      one of these) may move even more rapidly <em>through</em>      ground water than does the H20 itself. There is also some      concern that layers of subterranean sediment which are, for      all practical purposes, impermeable to such substances as      oil and salt may be far <em>more</em> permeable to this new      breed of pollutant. Thus clay layers that had previously      been considered adequate for "insulating" drinking-water      aquifers from those used to house disposed-of waste (yes,      toxic substances of all sorts are actually pumped      underground in efforts to "get rid" of them) may already be      proving inadequate to confine the volatile organic      chemicals.    </p>    <p>      If you hope to become involved in analyzing the effects of      a specific source of contamination, you must understand      your local hydrology. You'll need to know, for example,      whether surface water-which might contain pollutantsis      passing into the ground water (a process known as aquifer      recharge), running off to streams that may be recharge      sources, or simply contaminating adjoining surface water.      The relationship of water movement to your drinking source      will be crucial to your ability to determine whether      harmful chemicals are contaminating the water coming out of      your tap.    </p>    <h3>WHAT SHOULD MAKE YOU NERVOUS?</h3>    <p>      <em>PRIVATE WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS:</em> Septic tanks with      drainage fields can release pollutants that may reach your      drinking supply. A well should never be located closer than      100 feet to a leach field, and 200 feet would be much      safer. It's also commonly recommended that the waste field      be lower than the well site. Though this rule does have      some merit, it certainly provides no guarantee of safety      ... since water tables often rise to match geography, and      pickup points for deep wells are, of course, far below the      surface. An especially serious threat can be posed by a      septic tank and drainage field that has been cleaned with      trichloroethylene (the toxic carcinogen mentioned early in      this article). TCE will do a fine job of removing grease      from the concrete chamber, but if it isn't all removed, the      volatile chemical will move quickly through the soil and      into the water table.    </p>    <p>      <em>WASTE TREATMENT PLANTS: As</em> we've already      suggested, the "cleaned" output from most municipal sewage      plants is something less than potable. And during times of      heavy rain, many of these facilities are forced to bypass      raw sewage because of inadequate storm sewers. This foul      outflow may be picked up by a water supply plant for      treatment (which may or may not remove any offending      compounds), or it may recharge the ground-water supplies.    </p>    <p>      <em>STORAGE LAGOONS.</em> Those who have to dispose of      nasty, hard-to-treat materials (and are not too sure how to      do so) often choose to dig a hole and fill it with the      liquefied product. Common contents for such lagoons include      the brine that's a by-product of petroleum production (in      theory, this sodium-laden liquid is supposed to evaporate      ... which it may do to some extent in very dry climates)      and various toxic chemicals and elements (which typically      fall to the bottom of settling ponds). Of the 76,000      impoundment sites pinpointed by the EPA (as of 1982), 70%      had no lining to prevent the migration of the substances      held in the "dumps" to ground water.    </p>    <p>      <em>LANDFILLS:</em> Many of the most serious well      contamination incidents have been result of legal (or      illegal) dumping of to wastes into "sanitary" landfills.      But you may be surprised to know that even properly      controlled facilities accept materials that can be      hazardous if they're allowed to leach into ground water. In      fact, it's been estimated that about half of the landfills      in the U.S. contain dangerous amounts of hazardous wastes.      (Used crankcase oil <em>-</em> which often has high      concentrations of lead, cadmium, etc. <em>-</em> is      one commonly found substance.)    </p>    <p>      <em>AGRICULTURE:</em> Excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer,      as well as of pesticides and herbicides, can result in      large quantities of these substances running off in heavy      rains. The contamination of surface water is immediate, and      studies indicate that much of this waste is beginning to      find its way into ground water, too. Also, in and areas      where irrigation is extensive, the problems appear to be      growing particularly severe. (Large feedlots are another      recognized source of pollution, since so much nitrogen is      deposited on the ground by the packed-together livestock in      such facilities.)    </p>    <p>      <em>INJECTION WELLS.</em> As we already mentioned, wells      are sometimes used to dispose of wastes. The majority of      these are found in oil fields, where brine is often      injected into formations from which oil is being removed.      (This is also a method of recovering a greater      <em>quantity</em> of petroleum from a rock bed.) Problems      with injection wells usually result from leaks either in      the well casings themselves or between aquifers at points      where the casings pass through impermeable layers. (Since      oil deposits are generally found at considerable distances      below the surface these days, <em>direct</em> contamination      is seldom a problem.)    </p>    <p>      <em>SEAWATER ENCROACHMENT.</em> When ground water is      removed faster than it can be naturally replaced in coastal      areas, salt water sometimes enters the water table. This      problem has already occurred at many sites along the      Atlantic coast I and is likely to become <em>more</em>      common in other areas.    </p>    <p>      <em>PIPELINES AND STORAGE TANKS.</em> Deteriorated or      damaged gas and oil supply lines, and leaky storage tanks,      can result in the entrance of large quantities of petroleum      products into ground water. (Some of the most notorious      cases have involved old, rusted-out tanks at filling      stations.)    </p>    <p>      <em>HIGHWAY SALT:</em> Storage piles for the salt that is      used to melt ice in northern states have been cited, as      sources of the excessive sodium found in some private      wells. Furthermore, the use of such salt on the      <em>highways is</em> a widespread, though less      concentrated, cause of water contamination.    </p>    <p>      <em>MINING:</em> Surface and ground-water supplies can      become contaminated through mining activities. Stories of      the acidification of streams in Appalachia are now legion,      and underground mining has caused some serious ground-water      pollution.    </p>    <h3>IS YOUR WATER POLLUTED?</h3>    <p>      The traditional tests for water safety include measuring      bacteria (such as the familiar coliform indicator) ... and      sometimes hardness, total suspended solids, and nitrates.      Most of the people we've talked with have found that their      local health inspectors are unable to go <em>beyond</em>      such rudimentary tests ... and when you find out what it      costs to check for just the most <em>common</em> toxic      elements and chemicals, you'll understand why. For example,      to have samples examined for just the 16 substances      included in the EPA's Interim Safe Drinking Water Standards      costs at least $500, and testing for basic volatile organic      chemicals runs a minimum of several hundred dollars more.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, then, it's not too practical to have your      drinking supply examined for <em>every</em> potential      contaminant. Instead, the best approach is probably to      attempt to determine what could be polluting your water      (the sources listed above are likely worth checking out).      At that point, if you have reason to believe that a      particular contaminant could be present, you might be able      to persuade your neighbors that it would be worthwhile to      chip in toward a $50-$200 test for that single substance.    </p>    <h3>CAN YOU TREAT YOUR OWN?</h3>    <p>      Methods <em>are</em> available for removing many pollutants      from drinking water, but the technology used must be suited      to the specific problem you're trying to solve. Aeration,      granulated activated carbon (GAC), and reverse osmosis (see      MOTHER NOS. 61, 62, and 63 for detailed information on      home-scale water treatment) are all techniques currently      recognized by the EPA to be effective against some of the      chemicals listed under the Interim Regulations and the      Suggested No Adverse Response Levels (see the accompanying      chart). In many cases, however, there is no generally      accepted treatment method (that frequently mentioned      chemical trichloroethylene is an example of a substance      that <em>can't</em> presently be removed).    </p>    <p>      There's little doubt that a properly used, highquality      treatment system will offer some protection against toxic      chemicals in your drinking water, but it's no guarantee of      safety. And to be effective against even the treatable      pollutants, the system must not be overloaded (GAC, for      example, requires at least a half-hour of contact to be      effective against some chemicals), and it must be properly      maintained.    </p>    <h3>PREVENTION</h3>    <p>      The regulations and the intent of the Clean Water Act have      done a great deal to <em>begin</em> the process of cleaning      up our lakes and streams. Anyone who's sniffed      <em>-</em> or even just looked at <em>-</em>      the Hudson in New York, the Cuyahoga in Ohio, or the      Missouri along its course in recent years can't help but      tell the difference from the conditions these waterways      were in two decades ago. Unfortunately, these sensory      improvements are far from adequate, since some of the      "sophisticated" contaminants that are just now being      recognized are both clear <em>and</em> odorless. Therefore,      we have a new lesson to learn about water: <em>Looks aren't      everything.</em>    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, the provisions of the Clean Water Act are of      little help in protecting ground water ... the pollution of      which, many scientists believe, is one of our most serious      environmental problems. Because ground water moves so      slowly (the period required for complete volume replacement      of the liquid in an aquifer is roughly 120 years),      contamination may take decades to show up. And once it's      fouled, there's little that can be done to <em>clean      up</em> ground water. (For example, the EPA has actually      "written off" the Mill Creek Aquifer in Jefferson County,      Kentucky because of iron and nitrates!) Since about 50% of      the U.S. population depends on ground water for drinking      supplies (and the percentage is increasing),      <em>preserving</em> its quality should be a top priority.    </p>        <h3>USING THE LAW</h3>    <p>      Obviously, federal regulations and agencies aren't doing an      adequate job of protecting our water resources, and the      present administration has yet to offer any real hope for      an increase in the EPA's effectiveness. There are, however,      a number of already available statutes that <em>can be</em>      put to good use by concerned citizens.    </p>    <p>      <em>THE CLEAN WATER ACT.</em> Also known as the Water      Pollution Control Act, the CWA's stated goal is to make all      <em>surface</em> water "fishable and swimmable" by 1983      (oops!) and to eliminate all discharge of pollutants by      1985. The EPA implements this act with the National      Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, and issues permits      based on discharge standards. Largely as a result of public      interest group lawsuits, the EPA designated 129 "priority      pollutants" in 1976 ... but, to date, standards have been      established for only <em>eight</em> of them.    </p>    <p>      In issue 79 of MOTHER, we outlined some of the attacks on      the Clean Water Act that are being supported by the current      administration. Continuing public support for strong      antipollution regulations is <em>extremely</em> important,      and additional pressure will have to be exerted to bring      about the controls that are already called for by the law.    </p>    <p>      <em>THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT.</em> The SDWA is the      regulation that directs the EPA to determine maximum      contaminant levels (MCL). Thus far, MCL's have been      established for only ten inorganic and six organic toxic      chemicals. (To put these numbers in perspective, consider      that of the 63,000 chemicals now used commercially,      <em>over 700 potentially dangerous ones</em> have already      been identified in public water supplies.)    </p>    <p>      Two very important provisions of the SDWA are its      requirement for public notification of standard violations,      and its guarantee of the right of private citizens to bring      suit against any person alleged to be in violation of its      regulations. But the aspect of the SDWA most successfully      <em>used</em> by citizen action groups is the "sole source      aquifer" provision. In Section 1424(e) of that act, you      see, citizens are given the right to petition the EPA to      have their underground reservoir designated as a      <em>sole-source aquifer.</em> If a groundwater supply can      be shown to be the only available source of drinking water      for a significant population, and if contamination of it      would present a significant hazard to public health,      federal funds can be withheld from any project that might      threaten that supply.    </p>    <p>      To date, eight sole-source aquifer petitions have been      granted by the EPA, and approximately 25 are pending. All      eight designations have resulted from the activities of      wellorganized citizen groups backed by scientific data. In      the next issue of MOTHER, we'll discuss the specific cases      of a few of the successful petitioners.    </p>    <p>      The SDWA also includes stipulations to protect underground      water sources from injection wells used to dispose of      hazardous waste. Though these regulations have been      successfully applied, brine injection wells used in oil      production are specifically <em>excluded</em> from the      SDWA's jurisdiction.    </p>    <p>      <em>RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY AC</em> T: The RCRA      was intended to give the EPA control of hazardous waste      disposal in landfills, and specifically relates to the      leaching of toxic wastes into ground water. Though the bill      was passed in 1976, the RCRA is only now beginning to be      put to use ... simply because monitoring toxic substance      movement into ground water is so technically difficult and      expensive. In short, an EPA <em>without</em> a substantial      budget (the condition it's in today) can do little to      implement the RCRA.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, at the root of the EPA's inability to      adequately insure the safety of drinking water is a lack of      reliable data on just how much of a particular substance      presents a given degree of health hazard. (Of course, the      degree of hazard that's <em>acceptable is</em> another      question entirely.) However, lacking information on which      to <em>base</em> regulations, the EPA seems to have chosen      to take no action at all.    </p>    <p>      In the opinion of many environmentalists, though, "evidence      of no hazard" is considerably different from "no evidence      of hazard" . . . and the question can be reduced      essentially to whether we wish to err on the side of safety      or of commercial expedience. Organizations that benefit      from liberal pollution standards (not only industry, but      also public waste facilities and waterworks) exert a      tremendous amount of influence in Washington. The only way      the other side will be heard is if you raise your voice!    </p>
