                   <h5 id="byline">      by Celine Caron    </h5>    <p>      People who live in wet climates are often all too familiar      with the effects of mildew on such plants as gooseberries,      currants, raspberries, grapes, phlox, and roses ... and if      the same individuals keep fruit trees, they're probably      acquainted with apple or pear scab <em>(Venturia      inaequalis) as</em> well. Many commonly used wholistic      controls aren't terribly effective against these fungi ...      while more potent fiingicides-including lime sulfur-do      indeed destroy mildew and scab but, unfortunately, also      kill <em>Anthocoris musculus,</em> a valuable predator of      mites and aphids.    </p>        <p>      The dilemma <em>does</em> have a resolution, though ... and      it came about through the work of an English entomologist,      Dr. Peggy Ellis. Since commercial fruit growers commonly      spray a 5% solution of synthetic urea on fallen leaves to      control apple and pear scab, Dr. Ellis reasoned that human      urinewhich contains 2 to 4% urea, depending on the      diet-could serve the same purpose.    </p>    <p>      The entomologist first tested her theory on a backyard      gooseberry patch ... and was pleased to find that the urine      was extremely effective in combating a mildew problem that      had afflicted the plants. Encouraged by this success, she      reported her discovery to the members of the Henry      Doubleday Research Association in the fall of 1978. As a      result of her report, I soon became aware of this      breakthrough in wholistic fungus control. And since my own      currant crop was plagued with a severe mildew problem at      the time, I was able to test the remedy immediately ... and      my results were every bit as good as those that Dr. Ellis      had observed.    </p>    <p>      More work has been done-on both a formal and an informal      grower-to-grower level-over the past few years, and the      success record is impressive enough to make me want to pass      the news of this technique along to MOTHER's fruit-growing      readers.    </p>    <p>      UREA . . . I'LL NEVER STOP SAYING UREA    </p>    <p>      Thanks to the research completed thus far, it's possible to      outline both preventive and curative urine treatments. In      either case, though, be aware that undiluted urine will      sometimes scorch leaves and could kill foliage, so the      substance should generally be used in its pure form only on      dormant wood.    </p>    <h3>PREVENTIVE TREATMENT</h3>    <p>      Step 1: Spray straight urine on trees and shrubs just      before the leaves fall in the autumn ... or soon thereafter      (in this case, of course, leaf burn won't be a problem).      Make sure, too, that the ground beneath the plants-out to      the drip line-is well covered with the liquid ... as this      precautionary measure will destroy any spores present on      the fallen leaves.    </p>    <p>      Step 2: Treat the trees and shrubs with undiluted urine      again in the spring, <em>before</em> the buds open. Be sure      to spray the earth beneath the plants, as well.    </p>    <p>      Step 3: Three weeks after the buds have opened, treat the      patch or orchard with a solution of four parts water to one      part urine. This procedure should be repeated whenever you      notice signs of a developing infection.    </p>    <h3>CURATIVE TREATMENT</h3>    <p>      Spray the affected bushes or trees with a four-to-one      solution of water and urine as soon as signs of fungal      attack appear. (In critical cases, I've used a two-to-one      solution, and achieved excellent results with no evident      burning of leaves.)    </p>    <p>      Urine can be stored in plastic pails or tanks. When it's      kept in such containers over a period of time, occasional      stirring will render the liquid all but odorless. Some of      the nitrogen in the urine will escape during storage,      unless you add a small quantity of material that's rich in      carbon content (two excellent candidates are dry leaves and      chopped straw) to the pail before any fermentation takes      place.    </p>        <p>      In short, human urine (which, if from a healthy individual,      is pretty much sterile) should be of real value to backyard      fruit and berry growers. To quote the <em>Hen?y Double</em>      day <em>Research Association</em> Newsletter, "This easiest      of all remedies ... should attack only the types of fungi      which produce ascospores or conidia, but it is worth using      it freely and observing results. . . ."    </p>    <p>      <em>There's a readily accessible and effective solution to      the problems of orchard mildew and scab.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE. Celine Caron is the</em> coauthor, with      lean <em>Richard, of</em> Fruits et petits fruits: Guide      pratique de production agriculture ecologique, a fruit-      <em>and berrygrowing manual</em> that was <em>published in      Quebec,</em> Canada <em>in 1981.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We</em> want to <em>note that MOTHER's staffers have      not</em> yet tested Caron's <em>remedy ... and that it      should be considered an experimental treatment and used      sparingly on your crops until you're confident of its      safety and effectiveness.</em>    </p>
