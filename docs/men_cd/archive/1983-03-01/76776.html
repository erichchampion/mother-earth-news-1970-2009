            		        <p>      <em>If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us about it in around 500 words (write to      Bootstrap Businesses, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) 105      Stoney Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North Carolina      28791). Be sure to mention when and where you started your      venture and with how much "seed money", what you make      (net), and anything else that might be of assistance to      other entrepreneurs. If your story is used in this column,      you'll re</em> <em>ceive [1] the satisfaction of knowing      that you may help someone else start a business and [2] a      free two-year new or renewal subscription to THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS (restricted)</em>    </p>    <p>      Last spring-as I was eagerly searching through the pages of      various copies of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) in hopes of      finding a venture that would help me bring in some extra      cash-I came across Mary B. Bowling's "River-Running      Inner Tubes" (on page 106 of issue 74) and decided to give      that enterprise a try.    </p>    <p>      Since I'm fortunate enough to live near a river (and a few      other water-recreation spots), I knew there would be a      demand for floats, and I opted to rent my tubes out on a      daily basis rather than sell them ... in order to limit the      labor and time involved in locating and patching used      castoffs. I found that this moneymaker isn't limited to      warm weather, either. During the winter, when snow covered      the nearby hills, I was able to rent my inflatable rafts as      sleds!    </p>    <p>      I began my business by gathering a supply of inner tubes      ... purchasing some at flea markets and garage sales, and      getting others from local tire stores and service stations.      (Most of the latter businesses were happy to give me their      punctured discards.)    </p>    <p>      With the help of an air compressor belonging to a neighbor,      my husband Al and I blew up all our round rafts and marked      any leaks with yellow crayon. After repairing the holes, we      reinflated the floats and spraypainted an identifying      "tattoo" on each of them.    </p>    <p>      In all, I spent only about $15 getting my new business      going, and my operating expenses are minimal, as well. I      shelled out a grand total of $5.00 for tubes (they ranged      in price from 25 cents to 50  cents). A tire-patching kit      and a can of bright spray paint set me back $2.98 and      $1.19, respectively, and I spent $1.50 for photocopies of a      list of safety rules and tubing tips that I hand out to my      customers. Though I do occasionally need to replace tubes      and replenish my other supplies, my steadiest continuing      expense is the $4.00 I spend each week for a small ad in      our local newspaper.    </p>    <p>      However-as Mary Bowling pointed out in her      article-the tubes do an excellent job of advertising      themselves. Stacked in the yard with a chain through their      centers, the oversized airfilled doughnuts are real      eyecatchers ... and I back them up with a large sign.    </p>    <p>      During the summer, when I'm dealing with river rafters, I      open shop at 8:00 a.m., renting childsized tubes for $2.00      and my larger, adult-scaled, floats for $5.00 per day. I      also collect a $3.00 deposit on each tube, and refund that      money when my rafts are returned undamaged. When dealing      with my "regulars"-people who rent from me weekend      after weekend-I often give a discount or throw in an      extra tube, to hold their coolers, at no charge. If a leak      should develop, I usually offer the customer a free weekend      of rafting to make up for any inconvenience he or she might      have suffered. And over the course of my first summer, I      brought in between $500 and $600 a month!    </p>    <p>      This past winter, when it snowed (finally!) in late      December, I took the advice of a few of my summer customers      who had urged me to rent out my rubber      rapids-riders-which Al equipped with handles to use      when pulling them up hills and to hang onto on the way back      down-for use as inflatable sleds. I renewed my ad in      the local paper at $4.00 a week, and on the very first      weekend I brought in $50.    </p>    <p>      The tube rental business doesn't demand much of my time,      and it is really profitable, providing me with a very handy      supply of cash both summer and winter. Now, as spring      brings an end to the snow season, I'm looking forward to my      second summer ... and the return of the river rafters.    </p>    <p>      Mary Hagemann<br />      Douglas, Wyo.    </p>    <p>      Ever since I began reading MOTHER (back in 1976), I'd been      growing less and less content with my city job ... and Jo      Frohbieter Mueller's article-on page 74 of issue      48-about making and selling stained glass objects      planted the seed that finally inspired me to leave the      workaday world, begin selling my handmade lace at craft      shows, and eventually wind up in my present business:      vending nutritious fare at these fairs.    </p>    <p>      In the beginning, I simply quit my job and devoted myself      to making and marketing my tatted wares, but it always      bothered me when my painstaking work went all too often      overlooked while the man at the hot dog stand was getting      rich selling "plastic" food. Well, it soon occurred to me      that my husband's knowledge (he was a four-star chef) could      help me start a concession stand that did <em>not</em>      offer junk, and I immediately began planning menus composed      of wholesome, natural foods.    </p>    <p>      My first effort at implementing the idea was a fully funded      and dismal failure, though. Unfortunately, we took a      "commercial" approach to our new enterprise <em>...</em>      and as a result that first culinary concession was doomed      from the start. We made every mistake possible: purchasing      expensive equipment, building a cumbersome booth, ordering      tremendous quantities of edibles, and buying an      "indispensable" $14,000 travel trailer. We took out several      large loans in the process, and were soon penniless.    </p>    <p>      After our flop, however, my husband went back to his "safe"      chef's job, and I started making plans to pursue the      business in a more <em>sensible</em> manner. First, I      contacted show directors and "booked" myself into a circuit      of fairs. This time, there were no grills and expensive      electrical equipment <em>...</em> I planned a cold menu of      vegetarian pita bread sandwiches made with fresh vegetables      and garnished with various yogurt and vinegar-and-oil      dressings. In total, I invested $50 in a booth made of PVC      plastic and canvas, and another $50 in food.    </p>    <p>      My first show extended over a three-day weekend, and my      sisters went along to help me serve the sandwiches. After      our initial three hours of operation, we were running low      on supplies and had to send out for more <em>...</em> and      by the end of the third day we'd cleared about $2,400 for      our efforts! However, while I <em>have</em> since served at      a few events where I did as well as or better than that, my      usual take is between $350 and $600 on a "normal" two-day      weekend.    </p>    <p>      Considerable planning and organizing is involved in this      venture. I must, among other things, find shows      <em>...</em> contact the directors <em>...</em> acquire      booths <em>...</em> line up supplies <em>...</em> take care      of licensing <em>...</em> and meet all local health      regulations. But the business is profitable now, and though      I don't usually travel more than 50 miles from home, there      are literally thousands of craft shows every year across      the country, and it's conceivable that a more footloose      person could operate his or her concession <em>every      weekend!</em>    </p>    <p>      As for me, I've limited my enterprise to attending only a      few shows a year <em>...</em> to allow more time for      parenting, which is my most important activity. Also, in      between craft fairs I'm able to pursue my      lacemaking-which I haven't given up, though it      certainly isn't as lucrative as the concession      business-and between the two ventures, I've made      several lifelong friends <em>...</em> bartered and traded      for a houseful of decorative and functional craft items      <em>...</em> and, most important, realized my dream of      self-reliance!    </p>    <p>      C.
