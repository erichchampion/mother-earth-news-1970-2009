        ABOVE: This pile of corncobs towers above the man standing in the lower right-hand corner of the photo ... and yet it represents only half a year Is production of the ""waste"" material at just one of Iowa's seed corn companies. Because the cobs are naturally porous, they don't gain or retain much moisture in outdoor storage (even when unprotected) and thus make excellent fuel for a gasifier.
