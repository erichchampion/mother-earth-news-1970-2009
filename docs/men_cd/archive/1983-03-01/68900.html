                <p>      <em>The sun's free energy will heat your home, steep your      tea</em> ... <em>and even tint your textiles!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Marianne K. Doss    </h5>    <p>      The next time you take down a pair of curtains and notice      that they've become sun-streaked and faded, take heart!      What ol' Sol hath bleached, he can also dye ... with just a      <em>little</em> help from a handy householder. Solar      dyeing-using natural colorings-is one of the simplest      and loveliest ways to keep the hues of summer alive all      year round. Furthermore, this technique has several      distinct advantages over the usual simmered-on-the-stove      method: It's easy . . . it's inexpensive ... and yes, it's      also fun to do! In addition, the colors produced are      softer, and-perhaps best of all-there are none      of the pungent odors associated with stovetop dyeing.    </p>    <p>      The solar method is a variation of natural dyeing, since      both call for the extraction of color from such vegetable      materials as wild or cultivated flowers, berries, tree      bark, and herbs. To make these hues permanent, it's      necessary to use a chemical agent known as a      <em>mordant,</em> which interacts with the dye and fibers,      causing the two elements to bond.    </p>    <p>      Mordants not only make dye colors permanent . . . they can      produce shades that are darker, brighter, grayer, or      altogether <em>different</em> from the hue of the source.      Among the common mordants are <em>alum</em> (potassium      aluminum sulfate or ammonium aluminum sulfate), which is      used in conjunction with cream of tartar and gives a tint      close to that of the natural dye plant ... <em>iron</em>      (ferrous sulfate), which will add gray to any shade <em>...      tin</em> (stannous chloride), which makes colors bright ...      and <em>copper</em> (cupric sulfate), which gives the dyed      fibers a greenish cast. With the exception of alum and      cream of tartar, these mordants must be ordered through a      pharmacist or a scientific supplies catalog. And remember:      Many of the substances are poisonous, and therefore they      must be kept away from children and animals!    </p>    <p>      For traditional natural dyeing, the yarn or fabric is      simmered for hours-first in the mordant solution, then in      the dye-in a kettle on the stove. For solar dyeing, on the      other hand, the "stove" is the sun, and the "simmering"      process takes several days ... but no more work is required      of the dyer than a daily stirring of the brew.    </p>    <p>      Materials that can be used for color include such things as      walnut hulls and bark, goldenrod flowers, red sumac      berries, birch leaves, rhubarb stalks, and marigold petals.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: See the article on page 181 for other      suggestions.]</em> There are literally hundreds of      possibilities ... in fact, much of the fun of dyeing comes      from experimenting with various plants and mordants to      discover the range of tints that can be achieved.    </p>        		<h3>DYE IT . . . YOU'LL LIKE IT!</h3>    <p>      Wool accepts color well, so yarn is a good choice for your      first project. To dye enough yarn for a small knitted or      crocheted item (such as a child's cap or a pair of baby boo      tees), you'll need a one-gallon glass jar (plas tic just      doesn't let the sun through well enough) with a lid, some      alum and cream of tartar, four ounces of white wool,      and-to provide the coloring-three-quarters of a      gallon (more or less) of tightly packed marigold petals.    </p>    <p>      Gallon jars can usually be obtained free from a local      drive-in or cafeteria (such outlets purchase mayonnaise or      pickles in them). Alum and cream of tartar can easily be      found at a grocery or drugstore. White 100% wool can likely      be bought from most yarn or craft shops. And finally, your      own garden, and your friends' and neighbors' yards, will      probably be your sources of marigold petals. (To produce      the best color possible, the flowers should be picked when      they're in full blossom, and the petals stripped off and      used right away.) Fortunately, marigolds are prolific      bloomers, and cutting the mature flowers encourages the      development of even more blossoms, so your experiment won't      denude anyone's garden for long.    </p>    <p>      Once you've gathered all your materials, rewind the four      ounces of yarn by wrapping it around the back of a kitchen      chair (or looping it around your hand and elbow) to form a      loose coil. Then, using white string -which won't      muddy the dye-tie the coil here and there, in just      enough places to hold it together. Next, thoroughly clean      the jar and lid, then put in 1/4 teaspoon of alum and 1/8      teaspoon of cream of tartar ... and fill the container half      full of lukewarm water, stirring it until the mordant is      completely dissolved. Now, add the coil of wool yarn to the      jar and pour in the fresh marigold petals to within one      inch of the top. Add more water until all the ingredients      are covered (you'll probably want to press down the petals      and add more, if needed, while you're pouring in the      water). When that'sdone, stir the combination with a long      stick, put on the lid, and set the jar outside in a sunny      spot.    </p>    <p>      Leave the container in place for about ten days (and      nights), stirring the contents once each day. At the end of      the ten-day period, remove the yarn and rinse it in      lukewarm water until the fluid runs clear. Then gently      squeeze (do <em>not</em> wring) the excess liquid from the      yarn, and dry it-spread out flat-on an old)      clean towel. Depending upon the humidity and such, drying      can take anywhere from two to four days.    </p>    <h3>EXPERIMENT!</h3>    <p>      Part of the fun of solar dyeing is in seeing the unusual      colors that often result, since the final hue will depend      upon such factors as weather conditions and the amount of      sunlight available, as well as upon the natural materials      you use. For instance, my first marigold-dyed wool turned      out to be not the expected yellow, but a bright lime green!      You can also vary the shades by performing the steps of the      process in a different order, by changing mordants, or by      cooking the dyestuffs and yarn <em>before</em> setting them      out to steep together. In this craft, one possibility leads      to another ... but do be sure to color enough yarn or      fabric at one time to make whatever finished item you're      aiming at-even if this means setting out four or five      jars at once-because two consecutive batches could      turn out to be quite different!    </p>    <p>      This year, why not preserve the beauty of nature's bounty      in some subtly colored knitwear? With the sun's help, this      is one dye-it <em>everyone</em> can enjoyl    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: There are many fine books available on      natural dyeing. Two that the author of this article      recommends are Dye Plants and Dyeing: A Handbook by Ethel      lane Schetky and Carol Woodward (1978), and Natural Plant      Dyeing by Palmy Weigle and Mollie Rodriguez (1978). Both      publications are available from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden      (Dept. TMEN, 1000 Washington Avenue, Brooklyn, New York      11225) and cost $3.05 apiece, including postage. Another      valuable guide is Create Your Own Natural Dyes by Kathleen      Schultz (Sterling, 1975, $6.95), which is available at your      local bookstore or through Mother's Bookshelf (restricted) (see      page 123 for ordering information).</em>    </p>
