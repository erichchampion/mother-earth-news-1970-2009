                <p>      <em>Generating your own power doesn't mean you<br /> have to give      up the convenience of AC living.</em>    </p>            		<h5 id="byline">by TJ Byers</h5>    <p>      The progress made in developing alternative sources of      energy over the last decade has demonstrated that      independent power systems (those using other than fossil      fuels) are not only possible but are also very practical.      In fact, a wide variety of generating equipment is now      available to allow individuals to take advantage of just      about <em>any</em> renewable source of energy.    </p>    <p>      For a number of reasons, however, most of these systems      produce only direct current (DC), and often do so only at      low voltages. Nonetheless, it's generally agreed that the      greatest potential use for alternative energy in the future      will be to serve alternating current (AC) loads ... since      those exist in the vast majority of modern homes.      Conventional refrigerators, most televisions, and      <em>all</em> induction motors (which comprise 97% of the      U.S. supply of electric motors) simply won't work on direct      current. Furthermore, although there are DC-compatible      substitutes for some such appliances, they're typically      quite expensive.    </p>    <p>      Of course, one way out of this dilemma would be to convert      direct current to alternating current ... and one of the      most effective ways to accomplish this is through the use      of an electronic inverter. In this ar ticle, I'm going to      tell you about the different sorts of inverters that are      available, <em>and</em> their applications. Then, in MOTHER      NO. 81, we'll get down to the details of putting one of      these devices to work.    </p>    <h3>AC POWER</h3>    <p>      To understand how inversion is accomplished, you should      first comprehend how AC power differs from DC. Compare the      voltage components of both types of power, as illustrated      in Fig. 1, and you'll see that in alternating current the      voltage is constantly reversed. The polarity (positive or      negative) switches rhythmically in the form of a sine wave.      On the other hand, the polarity of direct current is      constant ... that is, the positive lead is forever positive      (even though the voltage may vary).    </p>    <p>      The basic idea of an inverter, therefore, is to      periodically change the polarity of the DC source. Of      course, there is more than one way to approach the problem,      but semiconductors (such as transistors)-which      accomplish the metamorphosis by switching currents through      a transformer-are the most common solution.    </p>    <h3>INSIDE THE INVERTER</h3>    <p>      Fig. 2 is a simplified diagram of a typical inverter      circuit. The workhorses are transis tors ... solid-state      switches that can be changed from "off" to "on" simply by      applying a small voltage to their control elements. To take      advantage of this property, the <em>emitter</em> leads from      a pair of transistors are connected to opposite ends of a      center-tapped transformer. The <em>collector</em>      lead from each transistor is then wired to the positive leg      of a DC power source-a storage battery, for      example-and the center tap from the transformer is      returned to the negative lead of the power source.    </p>        <p>      If you're a little hazy about this, read on ... I think the      picture will become clear once the sequence of events is      described. First, a signal is applied to the left      transistor that "tells" it to allow current to pass. The      flow of electrons proceeds from the battery, through the      transformer, into the transistor, and back around to the      battery ... counter-clockwise as indicated by the arrow.      The transformer primary winding delivers the energy to the      output winding, and current moves in a clockwise direction      through the load as shown.    </p>        <p>      After about eight-thousandths of a second, the first      transistor is turned off and the other (on the right) is      switched on. As shown in Fig. 3, the current again flows      from the battery, through the transformer, into a      transistor (but this time it's the one on the right), and      back to the battery. However, the current is now traveling      in the <em>opposite</em> direction (clockwise) in the      transformer windings. This means that the electron movement      in the load portion of the circuit is counterclockwise.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, then, this switching mimics an AC current      pattern, and when it performs a backward and forward flow      60 times per second, you get the rough equivalent of      60-hertz electricity. (What's more, the transformer can be      designed to raise voltage to the desired level.)    </p>    <h3>EFFICIENCY</h3>    <p>      Although transistors are employed in many small inverters,      they're not really very efficient when used as switching      devices. Consequently, for inverters larger than one      kilowatt (KW), a component called a silicon-controlled      rectifier (SCR) is substituted in the same basic circuit.      Units using SCR's are available with power capabilities of      10 KW or more.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, even an SCR absorbs a portion of the power      that it's controlling, and losses in the transformer core      and from wire resistance add to the toll. All in all, you      can expect an inverter to supply about <em>9007b</em> of      the <em>input</em> power to the load <em>...</em> but only      under ideal conditions.    </p>    <p>      An inverter usually performs best when it's fully loaded,      or close to it (see Fig. 4). For example, if you have a      500-watt unit, it will work most efficiently when you're      drawing 400 to 500 watts through it. As the load drops, so      does the mechanism's efficiency . . . since an inverter      requires a certain amount of what's referred to as "tare"      energy to keep it running. At low demand, operating power      can become a large part of the overall output. In fact,      this standby (or idle) current will be between 5 and      <em>20%</em> of the maximum power the device is capable of      supplying, depending on the particular inverter.    </p>    <p>      The obvious solution to tare loss (which can drain your      batteries of valuable energy) is to shut down the inverter      when no power is being demanded. Several models on the      market incorporate circuits that sense power demand and      switch the inverter off when there's no load.    </p>    <h3>MODIFIED WAVEFORMS</h3>    <p>      You may have noticed that I used the word "mimics" when      describing an invert er's attempt at producing AC power.      While it is true that the simplified circuit shown in Fig.      <em>2</em> would produce alternating current, the form of      the wave generated by the two transistors would be far from      sinusoidal <em>...</em> which is the pattern of pure AC      utility power, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In fact, the      waveform from our simple inverter would be more properly      called square, because of its characteristic shape (which      is shown-interposed with a sine wave, for      comparison-in Fig. 5A).    </p>    <p>      Now some AC equipment can handle squarewave AC power just      fine, but other devices have real problems with it.      Induction motors, for example, are designed to work on the      purest type of AC current-the sine wave-and      when the transistors in an inverter deliver a square wave      (which represents at a minimum, a distortion of 40% from      the sine wave) to one of these devices, the motor must work      harder to overcome the counterproductive currents. The      result is a marked increase in operating temperature and a      loss of efficiency.    </p>    <p>      The ultimate solution, of course, would be to generate a      sine wave. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done,      since inverters capable of producing such a form are      inherently bulky, expensive, and inefficient. A simpler      remedy is to <em>modify</em> a square wave to remove as      much of the distortion as possible. For example, if we      delay the activation of the second transistor, we'll get a      waveform that looks much like the one shown in Fig. 5B. As      you can see, this modified square wave is an improvement.      The distortion has been reduced from 40% to less than 20%.    </p>    <p>      Some inverters extend this concept even further by stepping      in multiple currents to generate the "staircase" effect you      see in Fig. 5C. The intricate switching pattern, however,      requires a controller that borders on being a      microcomputer, which increases the complexity and cost of      the devices. In fact, as a general rule, you can assume      that the closer an inverter's waveform is to sinusoidal,      the more you should expect to pay for the device.    </p>    <h3>SURGE DEMANDS</h3>    <p>      Inverter design and selection is further complicated by the      fact that not all AC loads react equally to alternating      voltage. A utility company can compensate for this inherent      problem within its sizable grid <em>...</em>    </p>    <p>      but in a small, independent electrical system, the behavior      of the load(s) is reflected back into the inverter.    </p>    <p>      An induction motor, for instance, requires substantially      more power to get going than it does to operate at its      design speed. (It actually takes <em>six times</em> as much      juice to start up one of these motors as it does to run      it!) As a matter of fact, <em>every</em> electrical device      in your household has some surge demand, though none is as      demanding as the induction motor.    </p>    <p>      A surge current can last for anywhere from a fraction of a      second to almost a full minute <em>...</em> and, during      this time, the inverter is placed under heavy stress.      Fortunately, inverters can be engineered to withstand very      short periods of extreme overload <em>...</em> but this      sort of abuse is best handled by SCR-equipped devices.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you <em>could</em> just buy an inverter large      enough to handle the calculated surge loads of the devices      you want to run. The disadvantages to this approach,      however, are twofold. First, and most obvious, a bigger      inverter <em>costs</em> more. Second, if you'll recall our      discussion of standby (or tare) power, you'll realize that      the upsized inverter will be forced to operate in its      inefficient, low-demand range once the load has passed      surge and dropped to its conservative operating level.    </p>    <h3>POWER FACTOR</h3>    <p>      Another aspect to consider when dealing with AC electricity      is the <em>power factor</em> of the load(s). The power      factor results from a time distortion between the voltage      and current components of the AC waveform, and is created      during an operation with a <em>reactive</em> load (such as      the running of an induction motor).    </p>    <p>      To make it more clear, let's consider inductance (a      reactive value created by the windings in a motor). By its      very nature, inductance resists <em>changes</em> in the      current flowing through it (it would rather the current      remained steady). But as we have discovered, both the      voltage and current in an AC system are changing      constantly.    </p>    <p>      So, as the voltage (which is unaffected by inductance)      increases across the motor winding, the current must work      harder to stay in step with it. However, despite such      efforts, the current can't keep up and lags behind the      voltage, as shown in Fig. 6.    </p>    <p>      When you consider that the simultaneous combination of      voltage and amperage makes up power, you can begin to see      what problems this time distortion might present. If the      voltage and current are out of phase with each other, then      the power-which is calculated by multiplying the      instantaneous values of voltage and amperage-will be      less than you would get by multiplying the peak voltage by      the peak amperage in the ideal situation.    </p>    <p>      The discrepancy between the <em>true</em> power (the amount      of energy the load is actually using) and the      <em>apparent</em> power (the power the load seems to be      using when the voltage and current are multiplied,      disregarding timing) is the power factor. For example, an      induction motor with a power factor of 0.7 is really      consuming only 70% of the power available to it. To      distinguish between the two values, apparent power is      expressed in <em>volt-amps</em> (VA), while true power is      measured in watts. Consequently, the volt-amp rating of an      appliance is always higher than its actual wattage.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, this phase shift also reflects back into the      inverter, where it can do real damage. The situation is      easily corrected, though, by placing a capacitor across the      inductive load. You see, a capacitor has a reactive      component which is just opposite that of an inductor: It      resists changes in voltage while leaving current      unaffected. By paralleling the proper amount of capacitance      to the inductive load, the effects of the inductance can be      cancelled, and the sine wave will once again be in phase      with itself.    </p>    <h3>INVERTER INFLUENCE</h3>    <p>      Just as the nature of the load affects the inverter, so can      the inverter affect some loads. There are three important      cases in which this can come into play <em>...</em> and      we'll discuss those situations briefly here.    </p>    <p>      <em>PEAK VOLTAGE:</em> The amount of power delivered by an      AC waveform is equal to the area under the curve      <em>...</em> even if that curve happens to be square. Now      if you refer back to Fig. 5B, you'll see that the sine wave      must reach a higher voltage if it's to develop the same      amount of power as the square wave.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the load (the power demand, that is) doesn't      really mind the voltage difference between sine and square      waves. It's interested only in receiving all the power it      has coming. However, some electronic devices are designed      to take advantage of the recurring peaks of a sine wave.      For instance, many color televisions utilize this voltage      to generate higher voltages inside the set <em>...</em>      thereby eliminating bulky power supplies. Obviously, the      square wave can't deliver the voltage that such electronics      require, and the set won't work properly.    </p>    <p>      <em>VOLTAGE REGULATION:</em> In most inverter applications,      it's of primary importance to stablilize the output      voltage. Without an internal regulator, a square-wave      inverter will give a correspondingly lower voltage output      as the voltage of the input drops (which is a regular      occurrence in battery storage systems). And since most      appliances are designed to operate within a specific      voltage range, an <em>extreme</em> drop could result in      damage.    </p>        <p>      When you shop for an inverter, then, you should be certain      that it has voltage regulation and that its range of      tolerance of input is in keeping with the generator or      batteries that will be supplying it with power.    </p>    <p>      <em>FREQUENCY.</em> Devices that are sensitive to voltage      peaks and regulation are also likely to be sensitive to      frequency (clocks and timers are two examples). Ideally,      the output frequency of the inverter should always be 60      cycles per second (in the U.S.). But in actual application,      variations in input voltage, temperature, output power,      etc. will influence the frequency. And, al though      <em>large</em> inverters do an admirable job of limiting      frequency drift, many small, inexpensive transistorized      units have no means of stabilizing the output at all.    </p>    <h3>SYNCHRONOUS INVERTERS</h3>    <p>      Yet another member of the electronic inverter family is the      synchronous inverter. Unlike the static units we've      discussed so far-which take power from a source,      invert it, and deliver it to a load-the synchronous      type is designed to be hooked up to a local utility.    </p>    <p>      As I'm sure you're aware, most alternative energy sources,      particularly the wind and the sun, are by nature      intermittent. To get through the calm or dark times,      therefore, people often use storage batteries.      Unfortunately, batteries are expensive and messy, and they      require maintenance.    </p>    <p>      The synchronous inverter eliminates the problems of      chemical storage by allowing owners of alternative energy      systems to use utilities for backup power. Though different      utilities have different ways of making the necessary      connection, the essential elements of the arrangement are      that you can buy power from the grid when you run short,      and sell it to the utility when you've got an excess. An      interesting note is that the utility is required-by      law-both to make this connection <em>and</em> to pay you a      fair (but, of course, wholesale) price for the power you      deliver to it.    </p>    <p>      <em>SELF-COMMUTATION:</em> This sort of synchronous      inverter is quite similar to the static inverter we talked      about earlier <em>...</em> with one important exception:      Utility power controls the unit's output waveform and      frequency.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, since the utility's waveform is purely      sinusoidal, neither square- nor modifiedwaveform inverters      can be used for interfacing. They can be adapted, however,      with the proper filtering to remove unwanted harmonic      distortion. The basis for the synchronous inverter is      usually a stairstep waveform unit, though, since output      from such a device requires far less filtering and is thus      more efficient. The frequency of a self-commutated inverter      is locked onto the line frequency by phasing the operation      of the electronic switches with the AC input.    </p>    <p>      <em>LINE COMMUTATION:</em> Another way to handle current      switching in a synchro nous inverter is to rely entirely on      the sine wave from the utility for commutation. With this      approach, the inverter won't function if the power lines go      dead. Consequently, an independent power system connected      to the utility by a linecommutated inverter won't be of use      in the event of a public power failure.    </p>    <p>      <em>POWER FACTOR:</em> One major shortcoming of many      synchronous inverters is their low power factors. Because      of present design practices and intrinsic characteristics,      it's not uncommon to find units with ratings of 0. 5 or      less!    </p>    <p>      Now power factor correction for synchronous inverters      <em>can</em> be accomplished with capacitors, as it is for      the static inverters we discussed earlier. However, an      inverter's power factor-and specific demand for      capacitance-is influenced by changing loads, grid      inductance, phase angle, etc., and as a result, it changes      constantly. To date, inverter manufacturers have relied on      the sheer size of the utility network to absorb these      defects. But as more and more independent producers are      placed on line, additional efforts will likely be      necessary.    </p>    <p>      I'd like to stress, at this point, that the power factor of      an inverter itself doesn't affect its efficiency ... it      merely changes the unit's rating. For example, a 4-KW      inverter with a power factor of 0.5 is rated at 8 KVA. This      doesn't mean that only half the power is being delivered to      the load, though, since if the power factor were corrected      to unity (using capacitance), the unit's capability would      still be 4 KW.    </p>    <p>      <em>WIRE NUTS AND BOLTS.</em> Unfortunately, tying into a      utility isn't as easy as it may first appear. Whether you      use a self- or line-commutated inverter, there are      important safety considerations to be taken into account.      The self-commutated inverter, for instance, would keep      right on humming if the utility lines went dead. This could      have several serious consequences. First, if the disruption      were caused by a component failure-such as a      transformer-the inverter would feed power into the      defect, which could wreak havoc. At the same time, a      service worker could conceivably receive a lethal shock      while trying to repair equipment that was supposedly      "dead".    </p>    <p>      In theory, at least, a line-commutated inverter should stop      working if the utility power is removed. This should      protect the grid from independent producers ... unless more      than one such plant is on the line. You see, it's not      impossible for two, or more, inverters to synchronize      between themselves and continue producing power.    </p>    <p>      A synchronous inverter, therefore, must include a sensor to      disconnect it from the grid when even one cycle (1/60 of a      second) is missed. Actually, though, it's not unusual for a      utility to skip a beat now and then, because of the many      switching stations such firms employ to manage power flow.      So the inverter's "fail safe" detector must be smart enough      to judge the difference between a slight case of the      jitters and an honest-to-goodness failure.    </p>    <p>      Living in an AC world may not be the best (or the worst) of      all possibilities, but it is one that we all have to deal      with. Through the proper use of an inverter, DC and AC      power can be made compatible-and      cost-effective-though ... and, for many of us, it may      be the only practical method of having our electricity and      <em>using</em> it too.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: In the next issue of</em> <em>MOTHER,      we'll tell you how to go about</em> <em>selecting, sizing,      and using inverters. Don't</em> <em>miss it!</em>    </p>    <h3>      THE CURRENT PATH NOT TAKEN    </h3>        <p>      <em>Before the advent of solid-state inverters, DC power      was converted to A C by a couple of different techniques.      One, the vibrating inverter, is now largely gone</em> ...      <em>and for the most part, its passing is no great loss.      Most of the vibrators were pretty unreliable, and produced      alternating current of limited quality</em> and      <em>quantity.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The DC to AC converter</em> - <em>often called a      motor/generator</em> - <em>is still with us,      how-ever</em> <em>and has some useful applications. Since      this device consists of a DC motor that drives an AC      alternator, its waveform is pure sine. Therefore, the      converter can be used for driving appliances that</em>      <em>require a sine waveform</em> ... <em>and it's      particularly attractive when you consider that it's      substantially less expensive than an equivalent electronic      counterpart.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>On the other side of the coin, motor/generators are      considerably less efficient than are electronic inverters      (they usually operate at no more than 80% efficiency),      consume a large amount of idle current, and require      periodic maintenance. Currently, there's only one      manufacturer of motor/ generators. You can contact it by      writing Honeywell Motor Products Division, Dept. THEN, P.O.
