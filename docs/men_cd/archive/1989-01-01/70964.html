                    <h3>      The year 1989 may bring strong solar activity such as      flares<br /> and sunspots.    </h3>    <p>      Previewing a real star-studded show.</p>			<h5 id="byline">      By Fred Schaaf    </h5>    <h3>      LUNAR LORE    </h3>    <p>      The dates are given in universal time, which is five hours      ahead of eastern standard time, four hours ahead of eastern      daylight time. (Thus, March 15 in universal time begins at      7:00 P.M. EST of March 14, and June 10 in universal time      begins at 8:00 P.M. EDT of June 9.) Right: Sunlight,      reaching the moon from the upper left in this illustration,      illuminates our satellite and creates its phases: 1) new      moon, 2) crescent, 3) first quarter, 4) gibbous and 5)      full. The moon then wanes through the sequence in reverse.      Far right: a calendar of moon phases.    </p>        <p>      SOME EXTRAORDINARY sights are in store this year for those      who turn their eyes to the cosmos. A lengthy total lunar      eclipse, dazzling meteor showers and displays of northern      lights, and several spectacular conjunctions-or close      pairings-of planets and other celestial objects are      just a few of the events ahead. And for a bonus, even      though we won't be able to actually see it, <em>Voyager      2's</em> final and closest flyby of a      planet-Neptune-promises exciting photographic      revelations.    </p>    <h3>      Eclipses    </h3>    <p>      On the afternoon of March 7, the first of two partial solar      eclipses (the only solar eclipses this year) will be      visible from most of the western half of the U.S., but only      viewers in Alaska and Hawaii will get to see the whole      show, during which 83% of the sun's diameter will be      hidden. The second partial eclipse of the sun, on August      31, will be even less accessible-it'll be observable      only from southern Africa, Madagascar and the Antarctic. It      will also be the last truly partial eclipse of the sun for      more than three years.    </p>    <p>      The two total lunar eclipses of 1989 hold more promise,      although the first, on February 20, will be visible in the      Western Hemisphere only from northwest North America, and      only as it begins, just before dawn. The year's potentially      spectacular second total lunar eclipse, however, should      more than make up for its daylight-obscured predecessor.      It'll be visible everywhere in the Western Hemisphere      <em>except</em> northwest North America, and will reach      totality during full darkness-on the night of August      16. Weather permitting, it'll be the first really proper      view that people in the eastern U.S. have had of this kind      of event since 1982. The August eclipse will also be, by      far, the longest total lunar eclipse visible anywhere in      the world since 1982: It'll last 96 minutes, only about 11      minutes short of the maximum possible.    </p>    <p>      The drama will open with the moon entering Earth's      not-very-dark peripheral shadow, the penumbra, at 8:23 P.M.      EDT. The penumbral shading probably won't be noticeable      until close to 9 P.M. Then, at 9:21 P.M., the real      excitement will begin when Earth's dark central shadow, the      umbra, first touches the left edge of the moon. The umbra      will creep slowly across the lunar surface until, at 10:20      P.M., the moon will be completely covered, initiating the      "total" stage.    </p>    <p>      In a total eclipse, the moon's glow usually is reduced to      about 1/10,000th of normal fullmoon brightness, but some      sunlight does filter through Earth's atmosphere to reach      the moon's surface. So don't expect Earth's satellite to be      blacked out entirely. Even at mideclipse (at 11:08 P.M.),      when the moon will be just below the center of Earth's      umbra, the moon will not disappear nor will it even appear      gray. The exact shading depends on the types and amount of      atmospheric dust present around our planet at the time.      Reddish orange is most likely, although some total lunars      are indeed black and others bright orange. Each is      different, so be sure to see this one. You won't get      another look at a total lunar eclipse until 1992!    </p>    <p>      The eclipse will pass totality at 11:56 P.M. The last edge      of the umbra will slide off the moon at 12:56 A.M. EDT, and      then the penumbra will slip away at 1:53 A.M.    </p>            <h3>      Sunspots and Lights    </h3>    <p>      Astronomers were amazed last year by a tremendous increase      in solar activity. Among other developments, there were      several cases of naked-eye sunspot groups, including one of      the largest ever observed (early last July). Solar      activity, which includes flares and sunspots, usually      builds to a maximum about once every 11 years. Astronomers      weren't expecting the next peak until 1990 or later, but      now it seems certain that the maximum will occur in 1989,      and that it will be among the strongest peri ods of solar      activity in recorded history. As one result, 1989 also      promises to be a prime year to watch the north sky late at      night-especially when large sunspot groups have just      passed the sun's central meridian-in hopes of seeing      the northern lights, or aurora borealis. Locations above      40Â° north latitude are best for viewing the phenomenon,      but when great auroral storms occur, even folks in Florida      and Texas can see these majestic, shifting patterns of      often-colorful light.    </p>        <h3>      Meteor Showers    </h3>    <p>      Meteors are the shooting stars or falling stars we see when      random bits of rock and iron from outer space enter our      atmosphere at such high speeds that they burn up from      friction with air molecules. Meteor showers, on the other      hand, are predictable on an annual basis. They occur when      increased numbers of meteors streak from certain points in      the heavens on certain nights each year. These are the      nights when our planet passes through concentrations of      meteoric material-cometary debris,      actuall--that exist at specific places along Earth's      orbit. Meteor observers can see fireballs (meteors even      brighter than Venus), bolides (exploding meteors), meteor      trains (the lingering trails of some meteors), and      "ordinary" meteors of all colors. To see the maximum number      of meteors in a shower, choose a place well away from city      lights and hope for clear, moonless skies.    </p>    <p>      This year, moonlight will ruin views of four of the six      major showers that were visible last year: namely, April's      <em>Lyrids</em> October's <em>Orionids,</em> mid-November's      <em>Leonids</em> and mid - December's <em>Geminids. To</em>      compensate, though, you'll get a look at several showers      that weren't visible in 1988, plus repeat performances of      the <em>Taurids</em> and <em>Perseids.</em>    </p>    <p>      Look for as many as a dozen <em>Quadrantid</em> meteors an      hour coming from the northeast in the last few hours before      dawn on January 4. The <em>Eta Aquarid</em>      meteors-debris from Halley's comet-will fly out      of the southeast at rates of 10 or more per hour just      before morning twilight on May 3 and 4. The <em>Delta      Aquarids</em> are best after midnight on evenings at the      very end of July and, the start of Aug ust. They and their      lesser companions, the <em>Capricornids,</em> are often      golden, and come from the south in numbers as great as      several dozen per hour.    </p>    <p>      The best time for viewing the often-spectacular      <em>Perseids</em> shower will be after late moonsets in the      predawn hours of August 12 and 13. On those mornings, the      swift meteors may rain out of the heavens at a rate of up      to one a minute. Try not to miss them! Also, the year's      last major visible shower, the <em>Taurids,</em> should      yield five or more slow, bright meteors an hour out of the      southeast during the first week of November.    </p>    <p>      In 1988, the seasons started earlier than they had since      1896 and 1897, and this year they'll not be far      behind-only about six hours later than last year.    </p>    <p>      Vernal equinox (the onset of spring) will occur at 10:29      A.M. EST on March 20; summer solstice will take place at      5:54 A.M. EDT on June 21; autumn will begin at 9:21 P.M.      EDT on September 22; winter solstice will start at 4:23      P.M. EST on December 21.    </p>            <p>      One star indicates the event is of special interest; two      indicate even higher interest.    </p>    <h3>JANUARY</h3><p>    1 Earth at perihelion at 5 P.M.

EDT.<br />    23* Fairly good chance to see Mercury at dusk, low in west,    around this date.<br />    27**Jupiter at opposition.<br />    30* Mars-Antares conjunction (compare red planet with red    star).</p>            <p>      <strong>Mercury</strong> never moves far from the sun in      either space or our sky, making it the most difficult to      see of the bright planets. But this year Mercury reaches      greatest elongation (largest apparent separation) from the      sun no less than seven times. On some of those occasions,      U.S. viewers will get a chance to see the planet either      about 60 to 30 minutes before sunrise or about 30 to 60      minutes after sunset. Mercury's best showing at dusk, low      in the west, will occur for a few weeks around May 1; it'll      be at its morning-twilight best during the weeks around      October 10. Mercury has some rather interesting      conjunctions (close meetings) this year, including one with      Jupiter before dawn on July 2 and with a bright star and      Saturn after sunset in midDecember. But its most remarkable      conjunction will be an ultraclose encounter with Mars on      August 5; I'll describe that event in the section on Mars.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Venus</strong> will spend much of 1989 on the far      side of the sun from us. At the beginning of the year, it      will be low in the east as morning twilight strengthens,      and will pass extremely close to three      planets-Uranus, Saturn and Neptune-in      succession (of these, however, only Saturn, which Venus      will go by on January 16, will be plainly visible to the      naked eye). Venus will reach superior conjunction (position      opposite the sun from Earth) on April      4-interestingly, the same day that Mercury also      reaches superior conjunction. After this, Venus will play      its role as the evening star, getting gradually higher in      the sky throughout the summer and early fall. It'll form a      close but low conjunction with Jupiter on May 22, and in      July will pass near Mars and the star Regulus. Finally, on      November 8, the planet will reach its greatest elongation      from the sun. At this time viewers with telescopes will get      a view of the planet in a half-moon-like phase. The final      month of 1989 will find Venus blazing brilliantly in the      evening sky, looking ever larger in telescopes, and setting      dramatically sooner after the sun each night. Don't miss      the fine moon-Venus pairings after sunset on July 4,      October 3 and November 2.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Earth</strong> seems holiday-oriented this year, at      least in terms of its orbit. Our home world will reach      perihelion (the closest point in its orbit to the sun) on      New Year's Day, 1989, and will be at aphelion (farthest      from the sun) on the Fourth of July.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mars</strong> was as close to Earth last autumn as      it has been in a generation, but during the first months of      1989 it will be left far behind by our own speedier planet.      In January, Mars will cross constellations from Pisces to      Aries and will shine as bright as many of the brightest      winter stars. By March, it will have dimmed but will still      form a dramatic conjunction with Jupiter in the west after      nightfall on the 11th. The red planet will also pair up      with Venus low in the west on July 11 and 12.    </p>    <p>      The real high point for Mars, though, will come after      sunset on August 5, when it will be a participant in the      closest fully visible conjunction of planets taking place      before the year 2020. From our vantage point on Earth, the      distance between Mars and Mercury will appear to be less      than 1/30th of the moon's diameter. The event will be low      enough in twilight to make binoculars and very clear skies      desirable for viewing (the naked eye will perceive the two      planets as a single point of light). To add icing to this      cosmic cake, the star Regulus will be only about a degree      away. In fact, three nights earlier, on August 2, Mars,      Mercury and Regulus will be joined by the crescent moon,      forming a marvelously tight quadruple gathering.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Jupiter</strong> will be very bright in Taurus in      the south on January nights. Gradually, this slow giant      will be overtaken by much dimmer Mars, leading to a fine      March 11 conjunction. Jupiter will have faded by May but      will still be bright enough to be seen meeting dramatically      with Venus at dusk on the 22nd. Shortly afterward it will      pass behind the sun and out of view until late June, when      it will appear in the dawn sky in time-a few days      later, on July 2-to give us a glimpse of the planet      outshining a bright Mercury low in the northeast.    </p>    <p>      In late July, Jupiter will pass from Taurus into Gemini,      where it will brighten alone, rising ever earlier in the      night, until it reaches opposition on December 27.      Opposition occurs when an outer planet reaches the point in      its orbit where it is on the opposite side of Earth from      the sun. When this happens, the planet rises at sunset and      is visible all night long until it sets at sunrise. As a      result, this is also the time when the planet appears      bright est and biggest in telescopes. Even though it's      roughly half a billion miles away, Jupiter-our      largest planet-usually reveals more detail than any      other planet when seen through a telescope (or even good      binoculars). So the December 27 event should provide      excellent viewing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Saturn</strong> will be low in the dawn sky when      Venus passes near it on January 16, and over the next six      months will rise ever earlier-in the middle of the      night by April, at the end of evening twilight by June.      Finally, on July 2, it will reach opposition, rising at      sunset and shining brilliantly throughout the evening. The      planet's famous rings will still be tilted, as they were      last year, about 27Â° downward from edge-on, revealing      their broad, reflective upper side. But Saturn will also      reach the most southerly point in its 29 1/2-year-long      orbit in 1989, making it appear for U.S. observers quite      low in the southern sky in the constellation Sagittarius.    </p>    <p>      Advanced viewers with telescopes will want to pay special      attention to Saturn in 1989, to witness a series of rare      sights on March 3, June 24 and November 12, when Saturn      will be in conjunction with dim Neptune. In fact, the two      will be relatively near each other (and near several      naked-eye stars in Sagittarius) all year. From July through      December, Saturn will be up and ready to view as night      falls.    </p>    <p>      To make finding Neptune easier, consult a detailed chart      from an astronomy magazine (such as <em>Sky and      Telescope</em> or <em>Astronomy)</em> or a star almanac      (such as Guy Ottewell's <em>Astronomical Calendar,</em>      available for $12 postpaid from Astronomical Workshop,      Furman University, Greenville, SC 29613). One other special      sight in store for as tronomy enthusiasts with telescopes      will occur on the night of July 3, when Saturn makes an      exceedingly rare passage centrally in front of the      naked-eye star 28 Sagittarii.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Uranus</strong> will be in Sagittarius in 1989,      only a few degrees west (left) of Saturn and Neptune. On      January 12, a good, powerful telescope might reveal its      conjunction with Venus in the dawn sky; look for a dim,      green speck close to a slightly brighter star and just half      a degree south of Venus. By summer Uranus will be rising at      sunset and shining its brightest-bright enough to      glimpse with the naked eye in excellent country skies if      you know exactly where to look.    </p>    <p>      This year, however, naked-eye observers wishing to spot      Uranus around the time of its opposition (June 24) will      have a problem: The aforementioned slightly brighter star      will be too close to Uranus for the two to be separated      without optical aid. The two objects will form an      especially close pair on July 14 and 15. Uranus will remain      visible in the evening sky until November, when it will      become obscured by twilight.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pluto</strong> in 1989 will arrive at what for sky      watchers is the most favorable position of its entire      248.5-year-long orbit: perihelion, the planet's closest      point in space to the sun. It'll still be no closer than      2,766,000,000 miles, but that's nearer to the sun (and to      Earth) than Neptune-something that can be said for      only about 20 years (in this case, from 1979 to 1999) out      of each of Pluto's near-quarter-of-a-millennium cycles.      Besides, when Pluto was last at aphelion (farthest out), in      1866, it was 4,566,000,000 miles out, a distance it takes      light over six and a half years to traverse.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, even this year, when it's at its brightest,      the planet will be hard to see. Pluto is much smaller than      Neptune and much dimmer. A telescope with a six- to 10-inch      diameter main mirror, or lens, is necessary-as are      extremely detailed star charts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Neptune</strong> should this August become the      eighth of nine planets in our solar system to be      photographed and studied by a passing spacecraft (only      Pluto will remain unvisited). <em>Voyager</em> 2, launched      over a decade ago, has already given us spectacular      photographic views of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, and now      will make its closest pass of all by Neptune-the last      world the spacecraft will visit before heading on its way      out of our solar system.    </p>    <p>      For earthbound viewers, observations of Neptune call for a      small telescope, or at least very good binoculars, and the      help of charts from an advanced astronomy almanac such as      the <em>Astronomical Calendar.</em> Neptune will be at      opposition on July 2, just 10 hours after Saturn.    </p>
