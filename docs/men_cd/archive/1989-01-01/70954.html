    <p>
                    <p>      Formal or functional, a half-paneled wall is certainly far,      far better than none.    </p>    <p>      IT IS SAID THAT SOMEONE ONCE remarked that "90% of British      tradition is less than a century old." Fact or fiction, he      no doubt had to confess that wainscoting had a much more      hoary place among the ranks of the legitimate. After all,      Shakespeare was a pup when English woodcrafters were      importing select oak to decorate the walls of contemporary      trendsetters-and when compared to the stone or wattle      of the time, wainscot paneling must have seemed the      greatest discovery since the longbow.    </p>    <p>      Traditional or not, wainscot (a term that covers any use of      paneling on the lower part of a wall) has a lot going for      it. In a practical sense, it's hard to beat the durability      of wood in places that get kicked, scraped and thumped as a      matter of course. In fact, dry wall or plaster that's been      damaged to the point of cracking can often be covered with      wood at less expense than would be required to restore the      walls outright.    </p>        <p>      Better yet, a well-planned wainscot job is adaptable to      almost any room. Panel widths and shapes can be modified to      suit doorways, windows, fireplaces and other details that,      aside from their function, sometimes seem to get in the      way. Chair rails can be muted for a modern look, or      extended to serve as a working shelf in a bath or kitchen      area.    </p>    <p>      A lower-wall treatment also offers an opportunity to      experiment with the change of textures and colors, either      to put some life into an uninspired space, or to lend an      air of formality to a room that needs a bit of urging.    </p>    <h3>      Built to Please    </h3>    <p>      Though all wainscot may have a distinctive look, there's no      end to variety in the ways in which it's presented.      Probably most familiar is the raised-panel style you might      see in a library or study-individually framed      sections with beveled or routed borders, a lower baseboard,      and a horizontal chair rail along the top. Alas, that bit      of convention doesn't come cheaply, since the panels are      solid wood and must be thick enough to display their      relief.    </p>    <p>      Another treatment uses beaded tongue and groove strips,      capped and skirted with casing or molding to define the      horizontal borders; the vertical field may be framed or      left to run continuously. This style is less elegant but      still offers a substantial surface that can be installed      without a lot of difficulty.    </p>    <p>      Beyond that, the limits are few and far between. The      wainscoted section needn't be solid wood. Framed fabric or      wallpaper, decorative paneling, brick veneer or woven      lattice have all been used in one way or another to create      a new look or to complement an existing wall.    </p>    <h3>      Raised Panel    </h3>    <p>      Since the raised-panel design is the most difficult to      reproduce, it won't hurt to begin by explaining the      process. The beauty of our approach-worked out by MOTHER's      research-shop staffer Dennis Burkholderis that it requires      only a lumberyard variety of clear white-pine components: 1      X 12s for the panels, and narrower one-bys for all the      other pieces.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RAISED PANEL WAINSCOT</strong>    </p>    <p>      This style uses a framework to hold the "floating" panels      in place.    </p>            <p>      To be fair, though, we must admit that the job can't be      done right without a table saw and two blades-a sharp      combination blade with a high tooth-count to cut the bevels      cleanly both with and against the grain, and a quality dado      head that will allow you to make consistent grooves and      rabbets (stepped edges). Having access to a router table      that will accept a 1- or 1 1/2-hp router is also a big      help, since it'll expand your ability to cut grooves and      edges in the shapes you want.    </p>    <p>      Keys to the simplicity of the project are two      accessories-a fence jig to keep the panels from      kicking out of square while you're cutting the bevels, and      a roller guide to hold the panels firmly against the saw      fence during the same operation. Plans for both are      detailed in the accompanying illustrations, and each can be      made from scraps and workshop discards in a matter of      minutes.    </p>    <p>      Each panel "floats" in a frame consisting of vertical      pieces, called stiles or muntins, and horizontal members,      called rails. Rabbets cut into the back sides of these      frame parts match similar recesses made in the panels' face      edges; the stiles have short tongues at their ends to keep      them in place. The structure is held against the wall with      a 1 X 3 baseboard strip and shoe molding at the floor, and      a 2 1/2" round-edged cap and a strip of bed molding at the      top.    </p>    <p>      Taken in steps, working up enough pieces to complete a wall      shouldn't be a major undertaking. Start by cutting all the      panels to your predetermined width and length (our 1 X 12s      were each 32" long). Then set the angle of the saw blade      and its cutting height. For a 3/4"-thick board, the teeth      tips should be approximately 2 1/4"off the table when the      blade's cocked at 10Â°-but don't judge these      figures as carved in stone. Your goal should be to keep at      least 1/4" of uncut material at the edge of the board while      creating a blade's width shoulder at the edge of the raised      central field.    </p>    <p>      With the saw set and the roller guide clamped to the table,      hold the panels upright on their long edges, and cut the      two side bevels of each. Because you'll have to set up a      jig to make the shorter end-bevel cuts, it's best to finish      up the sides of all the panels first.    </p>    <p>      Having done that, bolt the auxiliary fence board to the saw      fence, and clamp a ladder-shaped jig squarely to the center      of any panel's back face. If you measured and cut the      auxiliary fence and jig correctly, there should be an equal      measure of panel above and below the jig, and its frame      should just clear the top edge of the fence board. Cut one      bevel, then flip the assembly end for end and cut the      other. Transfer the jig to the next panel, and so forth, to      complete your bevel cuts.    </p>    <p>      The remaining panel work can be done with a dado blade or a      rabbeting bit in the fixed router. All that's required is      to dress the edges of each panel to form a squared      perimeter lip about 1/2" wide and 1/4" thick. In either      case, the work is held flat against the machine's table.    </p>    <p>      Next, tackle the stiles that fit between the panels.      They're the same length as the panel boards and can be      trimmed down to 2 1/4" from 1 X 3s for a clean, sharp-edged      appearance. Use your dado blade to make 1/4"deep,      9/16"-wide rabbets in the back edges of each piece; then      set the blade to a 1/2" depth, and trim the face ends to      make an upper and lower tongue on each stile.    </p>    <p>      The rails that complete the upper and low er framing are      cut from 1 X 4s and 1 X 6s, respectively. Again, a 1/4" X      9/16" rabbet is cut into each piece, but only on one edge      this time. With that completed, the only other profile      cutting to consider is working a shape into the facing edge      of the cap that makes up part of the chair rail. There's no      reason why you can't buy casing or window stool molding for      this, but if you're forming the stock yourself, a few good      bit choices would in clude a 3/8" corner round, a full      half-round or a Roman ogee. Any substantial cutting would      call for a 1 1/2-hp router.    </p>    <p>      The design of the base and cap trim should be left to your      judgment, since it may reflect what's already in the room.      If you need a guide, however, notice that the baseboard      with its shoe molding strip is about twice the height of      the correspond ing bed molding; if anything, you want the      structure to ap pear slightly bottom-heavy-an      illusion that can be fine-tuned by experimenting with the      width of the chair rail cap.    </p>    <h3>      Beaded Strips    </h3>    <p>      In a space where a rustic or cottage look carries more      weight than something formal, beaded 3/4" boards can work      well as wainscot. There are plenty of choices: 1 X 3      strips, grooved 1 X 4s or wider 1 X 6 boards. If you're      pleased with a smooth surface, you might even consider      tongue-and-groove subflooring.    </p>        <h3>      BEADED STRIP WAINSCOT    </h3>    <p>      This style can be made from most any lumber and is easy to      install.    </p>        <p>      Naturally, beaded boards-in which ribs and reliefs      have been cut into the face-are more expensive than      unmilled lumber. But with a minimum of effort you can use      your table saw to slightly bevel the edges of any plain      board to fancy it up a bit. Set the saw blade at a 45Â°      angle and at a depth shallow enough to remove just 1/4" or      so of wood. Adjust the fence to position your work, then      run the stock through in 10' lengths until it's all been      cut. Reset the fence, if needed, to cut the other side,      then pass the boards through again, this time starting with      the ends that left the saw last.    </p>    <p>      What if you have a supply of good square-edged boards or      can't find tongue-and-groove strips in the quality you're      looking for? Not to worry-use a dado head on the saw      (or a slot cutter in the router) to cut 1/2"-deep,      1/4"-wide grooves into the edges of each board, then switch      to the combination blade to make 1/8"-wide splines of 1/4"      plywood to join adjacent grooves.    </p>    <p>      There's no reason, of course, why you could not use      hardboard or thinner paneling scraps to make the spline      sections if the wainscot boards are thinner than 3/4". Once      the grooves have been completed, you can cut the      full-length boards to their shorter finished size.    </p>    <p>      To save the work of cutting tongues on the end of each      vertical board (and rabbets in the trim to match), it's OK      to fasten the boards permanently by nailing the base and      bed moldings to the studs in the wall, securing the      wainscot behind the horizontal moldings.    </p>    <p>      A bead of adhesive on the back of each board will keep the      vertical section from falling while you attach the molding      strips. A 2" cap at the top and shoe molding at the bottom      will complete the job.    </p>    <h3>      Finishing Up    </h3>    <p>      Depending upon what's above the wainscot section, you may      want to paint or stain the wood below. Assuming you sanded      the components before assembling the wall, a light surface      sanding will be all that's needed to get the grain ready.    </p>    <p>      If you paint, be sure to fill all the nail holes and gouges      and use a primer-sealer first. The finish coat should be a      semigloss, since it will stand up to cleaning and abuse      better than a flat finish.    </p>    <p>      Stain, in itself, acts as a wood sealer, but it should be      covered with a finishing oil, or a polyurethane top coat,      if you feel the wood needs more surface protection. Modern      gel stains are a good choice for vertical applications such      as these because they're less likely to spatter. To save an      extra step, some manufacturers make a stain and      polyurethane that colors, seals and coats the grain all at      once.    </p>                <h3>      PLANNING MAKES PERFECT    </h3>    <p>      BEFORE LEAPING HEADLONG INTO your wainscoting project, it      would be worthwhile to know a few things about halfpaneling      in general. Even in tall rooms, the finished height of the      wainscot isn't necessarily determined by the height of the      ceiling. A chair rail that rests between 40" and 42" from      the floor looks fine in nearly all spaces and still falls      below the level of most switch plates.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, the rail <em>won't</em> pass beneath      windowsills, shelving and so forth, so you must work around      such bothersome details-a process that often calls      upon imagination more than skill. If, for example, a door      casing splits a panel, you can use a wider stile on either      side of the door-along with narrower panels-to      create a balance. If the area beneath a window is too wide      to accommodate one panel, but too narrow to fit two, try      turning the panel horizontally at that and other window      locations in the room.    </p>    <p>      It's best to lay out the position of panels beforehand,      based on the distance between corners and the door and      window frames. By treating each individual run as a      complete section, you can make the panel widths uniform by      dividing the section into equal spaces. Thus, an unbroken      section 6 1/2' in width can consist of six framed panels      made to the dimensions described in the main article: 10      1/4" of face for each panel, and a total of 15 3/4" for the      seven stiles.    </p>    <p>      Finally, there are two ways to mount wainscot to the wall.      One way is to cut and remove the dry wall below the chair      rail. This allows the wainscot to be recessed for a more      built in look-but also means fastening two horizontal      strips, or nailers, to the exposed studs to give the panels      something to brace against. The other is far easier. Simply      locate the studs behind the dry wall, and nail the rails to      them. The lower rail can be fastened to the wall's bottom      plate, as well.    </p>
