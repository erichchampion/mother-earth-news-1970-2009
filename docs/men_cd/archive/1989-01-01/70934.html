            <p>      Issue # 115 - January/February 1989</p>    <p>  To Your Health    </p>        <p>      <em>What happens when a small West Virginia town contracts      health fever?<br /></em><br />    </p><h5 id="byline">By Pat Stone</h5>        <p>      STEP THROUGH THE DOORWAY OF the Bayer Wellness office right      at 12 o'clock and, the next thing you know, you'll be      headed right back out-on the "Noon Exercise Walk." While      trim Dr. Bill Reger, the head coach (i.e., program      director), cheerfully dispenses such advice as "Eat fat,      get fat," you'll pace briskly through the town, caught up      in conversation about cholesterol levels and optimum pulse      rates.    </p>    <p>      You've found Wellness, West Virginia. Excuse me,      <em>Wellsburg</em> , West Virginia. Eleven thousand people      live in this town, wedged in the wild, wonderful state's      northern panhandle between the Ohio River on the west and      Pennsylvania's mountains on the east. Wellsburg's a factory      town-glass, steel, plastic fuel cans, Pillsbury flour      bags, even McDonald's Fun Meals boxes are cranked out by      people working "turns" in the riverside mills. It's a      football town-the Brooke High Bruins fans often      outnumber the opposition's supporters at <em>away</em>      games. (The school has a new "half' stadium, with press      box, full facilities and seats for almost 3,000 on the      Bruins' side-and a few bleachers and four portable      toilets for the visitors.) It's also a bit of a tourist      town-with a recently renovated historic town plaza      and summer steamboats and tour buses.    </p>    <p>      Last spring, Wellsburg welcomed a surprising new industry      into its midst: health. Like the unseen rich donor on the      old "Millionaire" TV show, the Bayer Company had been      looking to bequeath a large gift. Bayer's target: a small      town with both bad health and good community spirit.      Wellsburg had both. West Virginia is second only to Iowa in      heart-disease deaths, yet-along with Bruin      fever-the city has several volunteer organizations      and a very strong sense of civic pride.    </p>    <p>      Add in a serendipitous name (the city is named after      Bezaleal Wells, son of its founder), and the company had      found the perfect recipient for its unique present: the $4      million Bayer Wellness Program.    </p>    <p>      "IN THREE MONTHS, I'VE LOST nine pounds and dropped my      pulse from 90 to 70, and my cholesterol level has gone from      273 to 185."    </p>    <p>      In cowboy hat and Nike sneakers, Merle Wesley is a regular      noon walker. Like everyone involved in the town's wellness      program, Merle will tell you his cholesterol level quicker      than singles-bar patrons once recited their astrology      signs.    </p>    <p>      In May, Merle was one of 1,000 Wellsburgians who underwent      half-hour physical screenings of cholesterol, weight, blood      sugar, body fat, pulse rate, blood pressure and stamina.      They attended individual health reviews and goal-setting      interviews. Then those screenees-and the county's      other 30,000 residents-were offered a barrage of      <em>free</em> health programs and seminars promoting the      overall lifestyle changes necessary to beat back heart      disease. Soon, stretching, aerobic and water aerobic      classes abounded. (Before the Friday football games, you      could even attend a 45-minute "Pregame Work out.") Dawn      walkers proliferated like rabbits on rich pasture.      Restaurants offered "healthy heart" menus. Grocery stores      suffered from bran shortages.    </p>    <p>      Bayer imported two of the program's most impressive      offerings from the National Center for Health Promotion.      Leaner Weight, "a permanent weight-loss and cholesterol      reduction program," stressed understanding food nutrition      and labeling, making moderate diet changes and adapting      favorite, but unhealthful, recipes for the better ("Don't      deny-modify"). By October, 150 Wellsburgians had      already been through the 16-week program, and another 200      were on the waiting list. One screenee commented on the      program's effects, "I was in the Shop-N-Save, minding my      own business, when this woman I'd never seen before looked      up from a soup can and said, `Here I am, 57 years old, and      I've never read a food label in my life!' "    </p>    <p>      WHERE LEANER WEIGHT TOOK A gradual approach, Smoke Stoppers      went for a clean, quit-now kill. It offered encouragement      (sympathy from an instructor who's an ex-smoker), reward      (put the money you save in a jar, then spend it on a treat)      and negative reinforcement (smartly snap an elastic      wristband-inscribed "I choose not to      smoke"-every time you feel the urge to light up).    </p>    <p>      Smoke Stoppers' most dramatic technique was "negative      smoking." After instructor Pat Peel dimmed the lights, the      15 attendees (sporting everything from high heels to a cap      claiming, "I'm not a hard drinker. It's the easiest thing I      do.") rapidly chain-smoked four cigarettes. They weren't      allowed to inhale or even hold the cigarettesjust puff'      frantically. As Peel played a tape of obnoxious static and      flashed slides of deteriorated lung tissue, a thick tobacco      smog quickly filled the room. Lifetime packa-day smokers      teared and coughed in the fumes. And all the while, Pat      (breathing through a respirator) yelled "Puff, puff, puff      This is what you've been missing all day long! Puff, puff,      puff!"    </p>    <p>      Every member of the nicotine-starved class admitted the      experience was horrible. But effective-75      Wellsburgians have already quit smoking. (Smoke Stoppers      boasts that 50% to 70% of its graduates are still not      smoking a year after they finished the course.) Are the      other aspects of the Bayer Wellness Program having an equal      impact? The full study won't be completed for two years,      but at the first trimonthly checkpoint, the answer was      clearly yes. The screenees' average cholesterol level had      dropped from 219.7 to 201.4. They had lost a total of 3,584      pounds (or "1.8 tons," according to an enthusiastic press      release).    </p>    <p>      And health had become a topic of widespread, often      lighthearted, conversation-even at parties:    </p>    <p>      "My husband ate so much turkey his cholesterol dropped 50      points. He's picked up a new habit, though: gobbling."    </p>    <p>      "I know a woman who dropped her cholesterol all the way to      140. 1 asked her how in the world she did it, and she said,      'Any time I put a food in my mouth, if it tastes good, I      spit it out!' "    </p>    <p>      Of course, not everyone in town has health fever. Drop into      the Corner Lunch for a rich bacon-and-eggs breakfast or      Lucky's Lounge for an evening burger and beer, and you'll      be quickly reminded that the Bayer programs currently      affect no more than 20% of the local population. But      participant or not, everyone in Wellsburg has been affected      by one aspect of the program: publicity.    </p>    <p>      Prodded by Hill and Knowlton (Bayer's ef ficient public      relations firm), network news stations, national magazines      and big-city newspapers have sent cameras and reporters en      masse into this little town, creating a phenomenon almost      as interesting as the program itself. People like Arlene      Smith (cholesterol down 38 points) admit that being on      "Good Morning, America" and other such shows has made them      "pretty blase" about the media. Others, such as a woman who      has both quit smoking <em>and</em> quit talking about it,      now evade all intrusion.    </p>    <p>      Some people see humor in the self-important operatives of      America's eye. Town reporter Matz Malone recalls the time      ABC brought in its big satellite feed. "It looked like the      reporters were getting ready for a space shot. They started      interviewing Mayor Cipriani in front of the courthouse, but      the janitor was cutting the grass and the lawn mower made      too much noise. They asked him to stop, went back to      interviewing, but just then the town clock started to go      off. They grabbed the janitor again and told him to please      turn those chimes off!"    </p>    <p>      A few people expressed resentment at being constantly      probed ("I told my aerobics instructor that if I get one      more boom mike thrust in my face during exercise class, I      quit!") and sometimes stereotyped ("A lot of the media act      like everybody in West Vir ginia is overweight and has a      heart problem. You want to see overweight America? Just      look around any major city air terminal!"). More than one      person wondered how much of the $4 million Bayer is      spending is going into the Wellsburg program and how much      into its clearly successful publicity campaign.    </p>    <p>      Bayer has consciously avoided advocating any      pharmaceuticals (including its own product) in the      Wellsburg program, so it's safe to say that overexposure      has been the program's only unintended side effect. And      almost everyone in town realizes that the benefits of this      community therapy definitely outweigh such annoying      inconveniences. Then, too, Bayer spokespersons say that at      the end of the twoyear period they hope to have developed a      low-cost wellness model that can be shared with other small      communities across the country. By these lights, the facts      that the program has only three paid staffers and 115      volunteers are strengths.    </p>    <p>      What will happen to Wellsburg's programs when Bayer pulls      out? Can the financially strapped county health department      really pick up the slack? What should one make of the      aspirin company's peculiar mix of altruism and      self-interest?    </p>    <p>      Director Bill Reger admits such larger questions beg to be      answered, but he emphasizes the positive aspects of the      program: "So much money in America is spent on illness      care, but almost nothing is spent on promoting wellness."      Bayer president Robin Mills "guarantees" that every dollar      spent on the Wellsburg program yields two dollars or more      in productivity and medical savings.    </p>    <p>      But the true salespeople for the program are, simply, the      participants themselves. An anxious schoolteacher going      through the painful trauma of renouncing tobacco, the      middle-aged bachelor quietly learning to modify lifelong      eating habits, the pleased young hairdresser who's walked      off 30 pounds at the high school track-each human story of      commitment and improvement is an independent inspiration .      . . and the real reason this corporate-city program must be      counted a success.    </p>    <p>      For information about Smoke Stoppers or Leaner Way classes      in your area, contact the National Center for Health      Promotion, 3920 Varsity Dr., Ann Arbor, MI 48108      (313/971-6077).    </p>    <h3>       MEANWHILE, ELSEWHERE IN AMERICA</h3>     <p>      BAYER AND WELLSBURG WEREN'T the only corporation and city      recently married at the altar of public health. Last      February, the Kellogg Company persuaded Jackson,      Mississippi, and Lansing, Michigan, to face off in a      "Cholesterol Challenge." Thousands of people in both of      these midsized cities had their cholesterol levels tested.      Six months later, they were rescreened, and the city with      the most overall improvement received a trophy.    </p>    <p>      The Kellogg program was not as broadranging as Bayer's: It      consisted mostly of distributing an educational newsletter      and convenient fat-and-cholesterol counters. Yet it had an      impact-at least in Jackson. The 7,000 Mississippians who      went through both screenings lowered their average      cholester of from 212 to 199 (just under the recommended      upper limit of 200).    </p>    <p>      The 2,000 Lansing residents who went through both      screenings, however, showed no improvement. Their      cholesterol levels stayed at 218, a borderline high-risk      number. Kellogg spokespersons say Jackson showed more      community commitment: Local businesses supported the      effort, and the TV stations did more stories on the      challenge. The winner of a friendly political wager,      Jackson's mayor received cases of Michigan trout and      blueberries from his Lansing counterpart. (He had agreed to      send up a dinner of southern-broiled- <em>not      fried</em> -catfish if Jackson lost.) Then, in a      surprise announcement, Kellogg committed $200,000 to the      city for further community health education.    </p>
