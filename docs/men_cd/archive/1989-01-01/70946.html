                <p>      Seasons of the Garden    </p>    <p>      What's escargot to the gourmet is trouble<br />      to the gardener.</p>			<h5 id="byline">       By Greg and Pat Williams.			 </h5>           <p>      EUROPEAN BROWN SNAILS WERE imported into California in the      1850s for use as food. The tasty mollusks didn't catch on      in kitchens back then, and many of them quietly "slipped      out back": They went wild and started eating (farm and      garden crops) rather than being eaten.    </p>    <p>      Today, dining on snails is becoming increasingly popular in      the U.S. There are several California escargot canneries      and even a Snail Club of America (with its own newsletter).      Unfortunately, the spreading interest in marketing live      snails means that <em>more</em> escapees may invade gardens      in other warm parts of the country (they don't tolerate      regular, heavy frosts).    </p>    <p>      To keep that from happening, many states now require      inspection of plants from California to make sure they are      snail-free; some states require permits to ship live      culinary snails; and two states-Florida and      Louisiana-prohibit any live shipments. But it's      difficult to stop ignorant or defiant would-be snail      raisers from ordering "starter kits." Recently, there have      been localized snail infestations in some southeastern      states. And even though such outbreaks have apparently been      controlled, just one overlooked snail could eventually lead      to a regional infestation. So remember, as far as gardeners      are concerned, the only good edible snail is a dead one!    </p><h3>On the Horizon . . .</h3>    <p>      Agricultural scientists are always coming up with something      new. Recent (but not yet available to the public)      discoveries include a drought-tolerant lima bean that      produced a respectable crop of pods full of tasty green      seeds on only <em>one inch</em> of rainfall in three      months; nitrogen-fixing tomatoes (the active bacteria were      hiding <em>inside</em> the plant's roots); and a nematode      that can inject lethal bacteria into those destructive      Japanese beetle grubs in your lawn and garden soil. And, oh      yes, researchers are also developing a boon for spray-happy      farmers: a tomato that doesn't mind being dosed with the      potent, widely used herbicide Roundup.    </p><h3>Research Briefs</h3>		  <p><strong>Did somebody say nematodes?</strong> USDA scientists have beneficial nematodes on the brain. With the      help of the California biotechnology company, Biosys, they      are <em>drying</em> lab-reared nematodes to make them      easier to ship. The resulting paste of very flat worms is      refrigerated and shipped, and the nematodes are then      revived with water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sprouting onion sets.</strong> Trials in England      have shown that onion sets sprout fastest at 60Â°F and      slowest at temperatures just above freezing. So to prevent      premature sprouting of your spring onions, store sets in      the refrigerator (but not the freezer).    </p>    <p>      <strong>(Gasp!) It's tulipfinger!</strong> Compounds found      naturally in several bulb species give some people allergic      skin reactions (called <em>tulipenvinger</em> in Holland).      If planting bulbs begins to give your hands rashes or      blisters, protect yourself by wearing rubber gloves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Good-by, dogwoods?</strong> Dogwood anthracnose,      first seen in the New York City area in the late 1970s, has      begun spreading at a rapid rate. This devastating fungal      disease has not yet marched west, but it has reached as far      south as Georgia. It affects both eastern <em>(Corpus      florida)</em> and western <em>(Corpus Nuttal</em> lii)      native dogwoods. Symptoms include water sprouts, cankers at      the bases of dead branches, and small purple-outlined spots      and larger brown blotches on leaves and flower bracts. It      is quite difficult to save infected trees. Fortunately,      Japanese flowering dogwoods <em>(Corpus Koysa)</em> show      excellent resistance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Give a nematode bad breath.</strong> Soviet      experimenters have found that a 1:1 or 1:2 mix of      homogenized garlic in water can kill plant-pathogenic      nematodes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cure those black walnut blues.</strong> Most      gardeners know that black walnut trees produce juglone, a      compound that can damage certain neighboring crops (such as      tomatoes). Several researchers have now discovered that      bacteria in <em>well-drained soil</em> break down juglone      and thus eliminate its toxic effects. So if you're having a      problem with nearby black walnuts, you might try improving      your soil drainage (or adding some soil from a spot in      which both walnuts and juglone-sensitive plants grow)      instead of chopping down the beautiful and valuable trees.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wash away spider mites.</strong> Frank and Gertrude      Hirsch have grown show-quality roses in Florida (spider      mite heaven!) for 17 years and found that regularly      spraying their plants with plain water provides better mite      control than using a water-insecticide mix.    </p><h3>Gleanings</h3>     <p><em>S</em> <em>ustainable Agriculture for California</em>      is an excellent 12-page listing of databases,      organizations, periodicals, books and articles. This great      resource is useful no matter where you live, and it's      <em>free</em> from the Sustainable Agriculture Research and      Education Program, University of California Cooperative      Extension, Agronomy, Hunt Hall, Davis, CA 95616 . . . .

A big bargain of a book, the      amazingly comprehensive 195-page <em>1988</em>      <em>International Green Front Report</em> (Friends of the      Trees, P.O. Box 1466, Chelan, WA 98816; $8.05) is filled      with information on sustainable agriculture, overseas      fieldwork, arid gardening, plant societies, herbalism and      more ....

Bulletin #758, <em>Apple Rootstocks and Cultivars</em>      ($6.15 from Publications Office, Cooperative Extension      Service, Kottman Hall, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH      43210), has color photos and detailed information on the      popular apple varieties.    </p>    <p>      <em>Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their food on a      small farm and publish</em> <em>HortIdeas, a fine      newsletter on gardening research and products ($15 a year      from G. & P.
