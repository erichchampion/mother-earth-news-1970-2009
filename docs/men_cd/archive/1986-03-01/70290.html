               <p>      MOTHER'S HANDBOOK    </p>         <h5 id="byline">      By Robert Carroll    </h5>        <p>      My wife, Ricki, and I first got involved with cheese making      out of necessity. Over the years, though, our involvement      with this ancient culinary craft has grown from necessity      to avocation, and has finally become a full-time      <em>vocation</em> (we now own and operate a cheese-making      supplies company). And believe it or not, that process has      been a real adventure.    </p>    <p>      Our story began when we purchased several milk goats, each      of which produced a generous gallon a day. At first we      tried drinking the milk as quickly as our does manufactured      it. Couldn't be done. Next we tried our hand at making      yogurt. But, as with milk, one can consume only <em>so      much</em> yogurt before it spoils-so our chickens      inherited the surplus, which they gobbled until we feared      they'd begin laying curdled eggs. And <em>that</em> was      when we decided to try making cheese-a craft about      which we knew absolutely nothing!    </p>    <p>      Since our local bookstores weren't exactly bulging with      tomes on cheese making, I retreated to the University of      Massachusetts Library and invested endless hours in      searching out old recipes (primarily of 1800's vintage). As      a result of this research, I finally gained enough      knowledge and confidence to actually give cheese making a      go.    </p>            <p>      For our premier attempt, we employed a homemade      bricks-and-orange-juice-cans press in an effort to turn out      a few pounds of feta (a brine-cured goat's-milk cheese of      Greek origin). The homespun press did get the job done, but      only <em>barely</em> , and it soon became apparent that if      Ricki and I were going to continue pursuing our new      hobby-of-necessity, we'd have to purchase some specialized      equipment.    </p>    <p>      After drawing a blank in our search for a domestic      cheese-making supplies house, we wrote to the embassies of      just about every country in the world that I thought might      have an industry producing small-scale cheese-making      equipment. During the course of that search, we opened a      correspondence with the Wheeler family, who, from their      farm in the south of England, produce and market a      beautiful, handcrafted cheese press. Eventually, Ricki and      I made a pilgrimage to the Wheeler farm.    </p>    <p>      During our stay, Mrs. Wheeler thoroughly indoctrinated us      in the craft of cheese making, giving special attention to      the hard English varieties. (One evening, she served us a      tasty homemade cheddar she called "Lilly cheese." We      assumed it was a local variety peculiar to Dunchideock . .      . until she took us out to the barn after dinner and      introduced us to Lilly, her Jersey cow.)    </p>    <p>      Upon returning home from England, we purchased our own      Jersey milk cow, Nelly, who turned out to be good company      for our goats and provided us with ample amounts of the raw      material that would allow us to begin making a greater      variety of cheeses.    </p>    <p>      Through trial and error, we eventually perfected recipes      for making a number of delicious cheeses at home-with      a minimum of hassles and at the lowest possible      cost-and eventually went on to found the New England      Cheesemaking Supply Company. In the following discussion,      I'd like to share some of what we've learned about the      craft of cheese making over the years, in the hope that      you, too, might become enthused about this ancient culinary      art.    </p>    <p>      First, though, a bit of background.    </p>    <h3>      Milk Requirements    </h3>    <p>      Any milk used for cheese making must be fresh and of the      highest quality. It shouldn't be mastitic (that is, drawn      from an animal with inflamed udders), nor should it contain      the residues of antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, or      sanitizers.    </p>    <p>      Do you own a dairy goat or cow? If so, special precautions      are in order: Raw milk contains a variety of natural      bacteria. Consequently, if you intend to make a raw-milk      cheese that's aged less than 60 days, you must be      absolutely certain that the milk contains no pathogens      (disease-causing organisms). Due to the high acid content      of raw-milk cheeses, varieties that are aged <em>more</em>      than 60 days are generally free of pathogens. If there's      any doubt as to the quality of your raw milk, it should be      pasteurized before use.    </p>    <p>      Pasteurization is a process in which the raw milk is heated      in a double boiler (or in a home pasteurizer) to 163°F,      kept at this temperature for 30 seconds, then cooled as      quickly as possible to below 40°F. The pasteurized milk      should then be refrigerated until you're ready to use it      for cheese making.    </p>    <p>      But don't depend entirely on pasteurization to provide you      with wholesome milk. Rather, begin taking precautions at      milking time by maintaining strictly sanitary conditions.      Be especially careful to avoid gross contamination. If a      cow or goat should put a foot in the milk pail, for      instance, the entire bucket would become contaminated. (In      case of such an event, if you can't afford to dump the      contaminated milk, strain it through a milk filter and then      pasteurize it.)    </p>    <p>      Milk should be collected only in containers that can be      easily cleaned and sterilized. Stainless steel is best,      though enameled and glass containers are satisfactory.      Avoid using cast-iron or aluminum pails, since they're      difficult to clean and can introduce metallic salts into      the milk.    </p>    <p>      If you must purchase your milk from the store, attempt to      find an unhomogenized brand. The process of homogenization      breaks down milk's butterfat, which prevents the cream from      rising to the top, thereby rendering it useless for making      hard cheeses (the homogenized fat globules are too small to      produce a proper curd). Homogenized milk <em>can</em> be      used, however, for making <em>soft</em> cheeses.    </p>    <h3>      Getting A-culture-ated    </h3>    <p>      Cheese making requires the efforts of two dairy animals-the      cow or goat from which the milk is drawn, and a microscopic      bacterium that lives in milk, consumes milk sugar      (lactose), and produces the lactic acid that enhances      flavor and gives cheese its natural resistance to spoilage.      Today, these specialized bacteria are bred in dairy labs      and marketed in freeze-dried packets.    </p>    <p>      There are two primary types of cheese starter cultures:      thermophilic and mesophilic. <em>Thermophilic</em> , from      the Greek, means a lover of heat. It follows, then, that a      thermophilic starter culture is used in making cheeses that      are processed at high temperatures-ranging from      105° to 132°F. This includes the Swiss cheeses,      plus such Italian varieties as moz zarella, Parmesan,      Romano, and several others.    </p>    <p>      <em>Mesophilic</em> refers to a lover of <em>moderate</em>      temperatures. Mesophilic dairy bacteria thrive in      temperatures ranging from 70° to 104°F, and are      used in making such hard and semihard cheeses as cheddar,      Colby, blue, Muenster, and others.    </p>    <p>      The majority of cheeses made at home-and both of the      varieties we'll be discussing in a moment-use      mesophilic starters. Fortunately, the process of culturing      (growing) this variety of bacteria is no more complicated      than making yogurt.    </p>    <p>      To prepare a mesophilic starter culture, you'll need a      half-gallon canning jar with a lid (or two one-quart jars      with lids). Sterilize both the container <em>and</em> its      cap by immersing them in boiling water for at least five      minutes. After removing the jar from the sterilizing bath      and allowing it to cool, begin the culturing process by      filling it to within half an inch of the top with skim milk      (mesophilic bacteria don't need cream in order to survive      and prosper). Now screw the lid tightly onto the jar and      lower the container into a pot of water that's deep enough      to cover the top of the jar by at least a quarter of an      inch. Place the uncovered pot on a stovetop burner and      bring it to a slow boil (Fig. 1). After 30 minutes, remove      the jar from the boiling water and allow it to cool to room      temperature (which may take several hours).    </p>    <p>      Heat-treating the milk in this fashion kills any harmful      living organisms and provides a hospitable environment for      the starter-culture bacteria.    </p>    <p>      When the milk has cooled to room temperature (72°F is      perfect, but don't risk contaminating the milk at this      point by dipping in a thermometer), add a packet of starter      culture: Remove the lid from the jar, pour in the powdered      bacteria, then quickly replace the lid (Fig. 2). After      swirling the jar around a bit to dissolve the powder, store      the milk in a spot where it will remain at or near room      temperature. After 15 to 24 hours, the bacteria will have      created so much acid that the milk protein and butterfat      will have coagulated into a semisolid curd, thickening the      milk to a yogurtlike consistency.    </p>    <p>      Once the starter culture has coagulated (don't rush it),      refrigerate it immediately and use it within a week . . .      or pour it into sterilized ice cube trays and freeze it in      the coldest part (usually the rear) of your freezer. Later,      you can remove the cubes from the trays, place them in      heavy, airtight plastic bags, and return the bags to the      freezer. A starter culture can be kept for 30 to 60 days      this way, with the cubes providing convenient one-ounce      portions of culture that can be thawed for use in cheese      making, or-sourdoughlike-employed to start      <em>another</em> culture. (One cube of frozen dairy culture      equals one packet of powdered starter.)    </p>    <h3>      The Rundown on Rennet    </h3>    <p>      Whole milk consists mostly of water, with smaller      proportions of sugar, protein, butterfat, and minerals. One      of the primary goals of the cheese making process is to      <em>remove</em> much of that water, thereby concentrating      the protein and butterfat into a delicious, easily      preserved form.    </p>    <p>      To do this, cheese makers employ <em>rennet</em> . Rennet      was discovered in prehistoric times, when glass and plastic      jugs weren't nearly as easy to come by as they are today.      Back then, the best milk containers folks could come up      with were animal stomachs. Just about any old stomach would      do. But, as people soon discovered, if fresh milk was      stored in the stomach of a <em>young mammal</em> for any      length of time, strange things began to happen . . . the      milk separated itself into a white curd and a greenish      watery liquid. This discovery was to cheese making what the      invention of the wheel was to transportation.    </p>    <p>      Modern science has developed a method for extracting      <em>rennin</em> (the active enzyme) from calf stomachs,      which is then refined and marketed in liquid and tablet      form. If liquid rennet is protected from direct sunlight      and kept refrigerated (but not allowed to freeze), it will      remain effective for up to a year. Rennet <em>tablets</em>      , if stored in a cool place (they can be refrigerated      <em>or</em> frozen), will hold their strength for      <em>several</em> years. (If you're a vegetarian, you'll be      happy to know about vegetable rennet, which also comes in      liquid and tablet forms and has about the same strength and      properties as calf rennet.)    </p>    <p>      Now, with an understanding of rennet and starter cultures      under our belts, we're finally ready for some cheese      making.    </p>                            <h3>      Recipe No. 1: Lactic Cheese    </h3>    <p>      It's best for novice cheese makers to start with the soft      cheeses, since they're by far the easiest and quickest to      make. One of my favorite soft varieties is <em>lactic      cheese</em> (also known as bag cheese, farmer's cheese, and      acid-curd cheese). This is a soft, spreadable dairy treat      that's a perfect replacement for cream cheese in such      dishes as cheesecake and dips-or which can be mixed with      herbs to create a delicious cheese spread.    </p>    <p>      To make a batch of lactic cheese, you'll need a large      stainless-steel (or enameled or glass-but never      cast-iron or aluminum) pot, a dairy thermometer, a      colander, some cheesecloth, a gallon of milk (either raw      from a cow or goat, or homogenized from the grocery store),      some mesophilic starter culture, and cheese rennet.    </p>    <p>      Begin by pouring the entire gallon of fresh milk into the      pot. Now heat the milk to 72°F by placing the pot in a      basin filled with heated water.    </p>    <p>      While the milk is warming, measure out 1/3 cup of      mesophilic starter culture, stirring it with a sterile      spoon to remove any lumps. When the milk has warmed to room      temperature, add the culture (Fig. 3). Now dilute one drop      of liquid rennet in two tablespoons of cool water, add it      to the pot of milk, and stir gently for several minutes.    </p>    <p>      With the mixing completed, cover the pot and store it at      70° to 72°F (room temperature) overnight. After 15      to 24 hours, the milk will have coagulated into a white      curd with (usually, but not always) a clearish      liquid-whey-floating on the surface.    </p>    <p>      After lining your colander with fine-weave cotton      cheesecloth, place it in the kitchen sink and gently pour      in the pot of curds and whey (Fig. 4). If the curd is so      thin that it flows right through the cheesecloth and      colander and down the drain-you lose. But don't give      up just yet; such a disaster simply means that you need to      add more rennet (perhaps two drops rather than one) to the      milk next time around. If the curd stays in the      cheesecloth, you're in business. Gather up the four corners      of the cheesecloth and tie them together to form a crude      bag, then hang the bag in a convenient spot (over a sink or      other catch basin) and allow the curd to drain for four to      six hours (Fig. 5).    </p>    <p>      After draining, remove the cheese (which the curd has now      become) from the bag and place it in a bowl so that you can      conveniently mix in herbs, salt, and honey to taste. (In      summer, Ricki and I like to add parsley, dill leaves, fresh      crushed garlic, and a dash each of salt and freshly ground      black pepper to make a delicious cheese spread.) If, when      you go to mix salt or herbs into the cheese, it feels like      a rubber ball, it's an indication that you need to use less      rennet next time. Your finished lactic cheese should now be      refrigerated, and will keep for up to two weeks.    </p>    <p>      Many of the problems associated with making lactic cheese      result from contamination. While you don't have to keep      your kitchen hospital-sterile in order to successfully make      this dairy food, you do have to keep your      <em>cheese-making</em> equipment very clean. Additionally,      if you attempt to make lactic cheese during the hottest      part of summer (when temperatures are running above      90°F), you'll be risking coliform bacillus      contamination, which can lead to a very unpleasant stomach      upset. Of course, if your house stays cool-in the 70s-and      you pay close attention to cleanliness, there should be      nothing to worry about, even during the dog days.    </p>    <h3>      Recipe No. 2: Caerphilly    </h3>    <p>      A n excellent <em>hard</em> cheese for the beginning cheese      maker is Caerphilly-a mild, white, crumbly cheese of      Welsh origin (sometimes referred to as children's cheese)      that requires only three weeks of aging. (Most hard cheeses      must be aged from three to six <em>months</em> before      they're ready to eat, which is a heck of along time to wait      to find out if a pioneering cheese-making attempt was      successful.)    </p>    <p>      There are 11 steps involved in making any hard cheese,      including Caerphilly: [1] ripening, [2] renneting, [3]      cutting the curd, [4] cooking the curd, [5] draining, [6]      salting, [7] molding, [8] pressing, [9] drying, [10]      waxing, and [11] aging. But it's not as difficult as all      those steps might make it sound, so let's get with it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 1-Ripening the milk:</strong> Pour two      gallons of whole milk (cow's or goat's, unhomogenized) into      a stainless-steel pot and warm it to 90°F in a basin      filled with heated water. (Since you'll need to maintain      the milk at 90° for some time, a dairy thermometer that      attaches to the side of the pot is required for this step.)    </p>    <p>      Now stir six ounces of mesophilic starter culture in a      glass measuring cup until all lumps are dissolved, add the      smoothed culture to the warmed milk, and stir gently but      thoroughly. With that done, cover the pot and allow the      milk to ripen at 90°F for 30 minutes. (Ripening refers      to the process of the bacteria converting milk sugar into      lactic acid, which will aid in coagulation when the time      comes.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 2-Renneting:</strong> Add 1/2 teaspoon      of liquid rennet to 2 tablespoons of cool water, then take      the lid off the pot and add the diluted rennet to the      heated milk and blend gently for one minute, using an      up-and-down stirring motion. Now "top-stir" the milk for      three more minutes, using a spoon or ladle to disturb only      the upper quarter inch of milk. (This is to keep the cream      from rising to the surface. Consequently, if you're using      goat's milk, you can skip the top stirring, since      goat's-milk cream won't rise anyhow.)    </p>    <p>      Next, cover the pot again and allow it to sit undisturbed      at 90°F for 45 minutes, after which time the milk      should have congealed into a white, semisolid curd. To      determine whether or not the curd is ready for cutting,      insert a clean finger at a 45° angle, then slowly lift      up. If the curd breaks cleanly around your finger, it's      ready for cutting. If, however, the test shows that the      curd is not yet ready to be cut, allow it to sit until it      is (another five minutes or so should do it)-and add      a bit more rennet the next time you try the recipe.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 3-Cutting:</strong> For this operation,      you'll need a long-bladed knife and a flat, slotted ladle.      Begin by using the knife to cut the curd into 1/2"-thick      vertical slices. Now rotate the pot around a quarter turn      and cut again, working perpendicular to the first series of      cuts. The third step requires a bit more finesse: Insert      the blade of the ladle a half inch down into the curd and      move it slowly back and forth until you've cut through the      entire curd on something approaching a horizontal plane.      Now go down another half inch and do the same thing, then      down another half inch, and so on until you reach the      bottom of the pot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 4-Cooking the curd:</strong> Warm the      pot of cut curds to 92°F by placing it in a basin of      heated water, taking the pot out and replacing it in the      water as necessary to hold the temperature for 40 minutes.      In order to keep the curd squares from matting together      while cooking, stir them gently and frequently. (This      process helps to eliminate water by drawing the liquid whey      from the curd pieces, which will gradually become smaller      and firmer.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 5-Draining:</strong> At the completion      of the cooking period, remove the pot from the warming bath      and allow the curd to rest for several minutes before      carefully pouring off the whey. After this initial      draining, dump the curds-which will probably now look      more like one big glob than separate pieces-out onto      a clean chopping board or a similar surface, and cut into      inch-thick slices. Turn the sliced curds over twice, at      five-minute intervals, to facilitate further draining of      the whey.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 6-Salting:</strong> Use your hands to      break the curd slices into bits approximately the size of a      quarter. Do this immediately after draining, before the      curd has a chance to cool. Next, place the curd bits into a      bowl and gently stir in two tablespoons of salt (you can      use less salt if you wish). If you want to add herbs, now      is the time to do it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 7-Molding:</strong> Sterilize a cheese      mold and a section of cheesecloth in boiling water. The      mold should be a container made of stainless steel or      food-grade plastic and capable of holding at least two      pounds of curds. (Avoid using coffee cans as molds, since      many such containers are seamed together with solder that      contains lead.) The cheesecloth should be of pure cotton in      a medium to fine weave and cut to fit the mold.    </p>    <p>      Place the mold in a spot, such as a sink, where it can      drain without causing a mess, then line it with cheesecloth      and pour in the curds. Use your fist to press the curds      firmly down into the mold, then pull the cheesecloth up      tight around the sides to eliminate bunching and wrinkles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 8-Pressing:</strong> Any good specialty      cheese mold will come with a <em>follower</em> -a      device that fits snugly into the mold and applies uniform      downward pressure on the curd when a weight is placed on      its top. (One of the advantages of Caerphilly is that it      doesn't require a great deal of pressure for pressing, as      other hard cheeses do, and thus it eliminates the need for      a cheese press.)    </p>    <p>      With the curds firmly fist-packed into the mold, fold one      layer of the cheesecloth over the top of the curds,      smoothing out any wrinkles. Now place the follower on top      of the curds. And, finally, weight the follower with a      pint-size canning jar filled with water.    </p>    <p>      After 10 minutes of pressing, remove the curd (which is now      officially cheese!) from the mold, gently unwrap the      cheesecloth covering, and turn the lump upside down. Now      rewrap the cheese in the cheesecloth and return it to the      mold. After making certain that what was originally the top      of the cheese is now the bottom, replace the follower and      the weight. Repeat this flip-flopping procedure twice more,      at 10-minute intervals, then leave the cheese undisturbed,      under pressure, for 16 hours.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 9-Drying:</strong> After the final      pressing, remove the cheese from the mold and gently unwrap      the cheesecloth covering. Now place the cheese on a clean      surface at room temperature to dry. During this phase, turn      the cheese several times each day, until it feels dry to      the touch . . . which could take anywhere from one to three      days, depending on the weather.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 10-Waxing:</strong> When your cheese is      dry, it can be waxed to keep it from drying out      <em>too</em> much, and to help retard the growth of mold.      (It's best to use specialty cheese wax, which doesn't crack      as easily as paraffin.) Find an old pan that's sound but      dispensable, and melt the wax, very carefully, over low      heat. (The safest method is to use a double boiler.)    </p>    <p>      The waxing will go easily if you cool the cheese in a      refrigerator for several hours prior to beginning, then      paint the wax on with a natural-bristle paintbrush (don't      use nylon, which can dissolve in molten wax). Paint the top      and sides first, wait 30 seconds or so for the wax to cool      and solidify, then turn the cheese over and paint its      bottom.    </p>    <p>      Now's the time to date your cheese. (While there are      specialty cheese labels for this purpose, just about any      self-adhering label that will stick to wax will do the      trick.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 11-Aging:</strong> Store your waxed      cheese on a clean shelf in a slightly damp environment at      between 35° and 55°F. (Most basements or root      cellars meet these requirements-but if yours doesn't,      play it safe and age your cheese in the refrigerator.)      During the first week of aging, the cheese should be turned      frequently-top to bottom-to keep moisture from      collecting on its under surface. (If you neglect the      turning, your hard-earned cheese could decompose on the      bottom.)    </p>    <p>      As with any new recipe, making these and other cheeses will      become easier (and the results better) with each attempt.      Give it a try, and I feel certain that you'll soon come to      agree with Ricki and me (and our friend Mrs. Wheeler over      there in Dunchideock) that cheese making is one ancient      culinary craft that's well worth preserving.    </p>
