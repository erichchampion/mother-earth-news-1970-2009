                    <p>      Here's the seventeenth in a series of articles that will      help you tell friend from foe in your garden.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      PART XVII: Chalcids    </h2>    <hr />        <h5 id="byline">      by Ron West    </h5>    <p>      In my last column (in MOTHER N0. 97), I mentioned that one      natural, effective means of controlling cutworms and other      caterpillars in your garden is to introduce a tiny      parasitic wasp species-known scientifically as      <em>Trichogramma</em> -whose larvae feed upon the      eggs of harmful insects. This time around, I'd like to      expand on the use of <em>Trichogramma</em> and other      chalcids as a natural means of controlling insect pests in      your garden.    </p>    <p>      <em>About 12 mm in length, this leucospidid wasp is a      parasite on the raspberry horntail, as well as being one of      the largest chalcids and a superb mimic of the yellow      jacket. INSET' A cluster of three chalcid larvae prepare to      pupate outside the body of their host, an inchworm.      Although the caterpillar is still alive, it won't live long      enough to pupate and reproduce.</em>    </p>    <p>      The 2,200 or so North American species of chalcids are      members of a large superfamily (Chalcidoidea) which is      divided into 22 families. Chalcids are typically wasplike      in appearance and have elbowed (jointed and bent) antennae      resembling those of ants. They differ dramatically from      other wasps in size, averaging only two to three      millimeters in length (though some reach 12 mm or more), as      well as in the fact that their wings are practically      veinless. Many chalcids have dark bodies and yellow legs,      but some are brightly colored with a gorgeous metallic      sheen.    </p>    <p>      Despite the chalcids' diminutive size, these garden helpers      are death on the eggs and larvae of some of the most      destructive varieties of insect pests, including two-winged      flies, beetles, moths and butterflies, aphids, leafhoppers,      scale insects, and whiteflies.    </p>    <p>      In addition to their devouring other insects in the      embryonic or larval forms, certain chalcid species display      a number of unusual, and therefore interesting, habits. For      example, some chalcids are well known for      <em>polyembryony</em> , in which anywhere from ten to over      a thousand larvae develop from each egg . . . good news for      the gardener who's plagued with insect pests and wants to      introduce a large number of beneficial parasites quickly      and with little effort.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, another chalcid phenomenon-known      as <em>hyperparasitism</em> -can work against the      gardener, and occurs when a chalcid uses another parasitic      insect for its host, thus negating the beneficial effect of      the victim parasite. (In one species of chalcid, this      hyperparasitism takes on a bizarre twist in that while the      females are parasites of scale insects, the males are      hyperparasites that attack the <em>parasites</em> of scale      insects . . . including the females of their own species!)    </p>    <p>      The big success story among the chalcids, of course, is      good old <em>Trichogramma</em> , which feeds on such      infamous garden pests as codling moth caterpillars,      cutworms, armyworms, bollworms, hornworms, cankerworms, and      a great many others. (If you decide to purchase a batch of      <em>Trichogramma</em> eggs for pest control, go with <em>T.      minutum</em> to protect orchards and ornamentals, and T.      <em>pretiosum</em> for vegetable and field crops.)    </p>    <p>      Another particularly beneficial chalcid species is      <em>Encarsia formosa</em> , which has proven helpful in      controlling stubborn infestations of the greenhouse      whitefly ( <em>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</em> ). Because      this little wasp lays its eggs under the skins of whitefly      larvae, its young will hatch right in the midst of an ample      supply of food. (Tests have shown that. this control      measure works best in greenhouses with temperatures      averaging 75Â°F or higher. In cooler conditions, the      whiteflies may develop faster than the chalcids and thus      lessen the parasite's effectiveness.)    </p>    <p>      To round out this discussion of chalcids, I should mention      two species that display atypical habits-one      beneficial, the other harmful. The first of these two      oddball chalcids is the fig wasp (family Agaonidae), to      which nature has given the responsibility of pollinating      the commercially important Smyrna fig-a tree that can      produce fruit only after being pollinated by the wild fig,      or caprifig. And because of the peculiar nature of the      Smyrna fig flower, the fig wasp is the only creature that      can accomplish this feat. The black sheep of the chalcid      family is the clover seed chalcid ( <em>Bruchophagus      phatyptera</em> ), which infests the seeds of several      varieties of legumes and is one of the very few harmful      members of the chalcid clan.    </p>    <p>      All in all, though, chalcid wasps are among the most      valuable insects you can have in your garden, packing one      heck of a lot of pestcontrol wallop in a very small,      totally natural package.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For more information on fighting pest      and disease attacks without resorting to toxic pesticides,      you might want to check out a copy of MOTHER 's latest      special publication,</em> Green Thumbs and Blue Ribbons.      <em>This $3.95 magazine format paperback</em> -      <em>which will also help you plan a productive and healthy      garden</em> - <em>should be available at your      newsstand now!</em>    </p>
