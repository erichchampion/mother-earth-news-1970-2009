                <p>      "On the roof it's peaceful as can be/And there the world      below can't bother me. " <em><br />      (From "Up On The Roof," by Gerry Goffin and Carole King,      Â© 19</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by Bob Kleszics    </h5>        <p>      Spring had arrived - robins, crocuses, mud, the whole      bit. But while other gardeners were planting (and joyfully      anticipating future harvests), I was lamenting the sad fate      that had befallen me: Because I'd recently moved from my      suburban home to a city apartment, I had become a gardener      without a garden.    </p>    <p>      By the middle of April, though, I'd found a salve for my      sorrow . . . and, surprisingly enough, I found it on the      roof of the food coop where I work. A 7' X 18' section over      an addition to the building sloped slightly to the west,      with an unobstructed southern exposure in the afternoon.      "Aha," said I to my frustrated gardener self. "All I have      to do is offset the slope somehow . . . fill a few of these      plastic, five-gallon peanut butter tubs with dirt . . . and      presto, instant garden!"    </p>    <p>      Well, as things turned out, there was just a <em>tad</em>      more to it than that.    </p>    <p>      After making sure the roof was sound enough to hold the      extra weight - about half a ton for what I had in      mind - I leveled the surface by building up the      sloping portion with four wooden pallets and some scrap      lumber. Then I scrounged together a random collection of      no-cost planting containers: The aforementioned peanut      butter tubs, some three-gallon Japanese miso kegs, a wooden      cantaloupe crate, and a variety of other recycled      receptacles.    </p>    <p>      I knew that water retention is important for      container-grown plants - especially when they're      exposed to as much heat as the crops in my hot-tin-roof      garden would face - so I was careful to use only      plastic (or plastic-lined wooden) containers. (Clay or      fiber pots would have dried out too quickly.) Also, for the      same reason, I drilled only two or three drain holes in      each receptacle. And I decided to use pure compost as the      growing medium, because humus holds moisture much better      than run-of-the-mill dirt or commercial potting soil.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, the small city where I live composts its      leaves and grass clippings, and lets anyone mine the      resulting black gold, gratis. So I loaded the back of my      station wagon with drain-hole-drilled containers, filled      them at the municipal compost pile, traveled back to the      co-op, lugged the heavy pots up two sets of stairs and out      a second-story window, and positioned them in my      garden-to-be - and then repeated the whole laborious      process several times, shuttling back and forth (and down      and up) until some twenty-odd casks of compost were in      place.    </p>    <p>      It was difcult at the time to appreciate what all that soil      and sweat would eventually yield. But at the end of the      day, when I put in my first planting - three dozen      onion sets in a plastic foam grape box - I already      felt that simply having a garden was worth all of the work.    </p>    <h3>      PLANTING    </h3>    <p>      Almost any kind of vegetable will grow in a pot . . . but      that doesn't mean it will <em>thrive</em> , or that it will      produce bounteously. So when it came to deciding what to      grow in my by-the-gallon garden, I took two factors into      primary consideration: the space required - both      above and below the soil - and the expected yield. I      immediately ruled out pumpkins and similar sprawling vine      crops, as well as root crops (such as daikon radishes) and      other veggies that have extensive or deep root systems. And      I also vetoed spare-hungry, low-yield crops such as corn.      (I knew that a five-gallon bucket of corn wouldn't produce      much of a harvest!) The <em>value</em> of the yield was a      consideration, too. I can buy a 50-pound sack of potatoes      for less than $3.00, so I figured it would be silly for me      to grow spuds.    </p>    <p>      Just what <em>did</em> I plant, then, besides scallions?      Well, my spring crops were red leaf lcttuce, Swiss chard,      chives, radishes, kale, and collards. My summer plantings      (which I was able to put in two weeks earlier than usual,      thanks to the heat-holding roof) included cherry tomatoes,      pickling cukes, green peppers, yellow squash, bush beans,      and parsley. I also added marigolds, coleus, sweet      woodruff, and oregano . . . simply because no garden is      complete without the color of flowers and the fragrance of      herbs.    </p>    <p>      I planted my seeds in a conventional manner, using      traditional depth and spacing guidelines. The onions sets      in the grape box, for instance, were planted on two-inch      centers - common spacing for intensive scallion      production. Lettuce, which also did well in grape boxes,      was seeded directly in three rows about four inches apart      and then heavily thinned throughout the season. The larger      plants - tomatoes, peppers, collards, etc. -      were purchased as seedlings; each got its own five-gallon      tub from the first.    </p>    <p>      The melon crate that I lined with Mylar (to hold in both      moisture and dirt) became a garden unto itself. It was by      far the largest container I had (about 30 gallons), so I      sowed three crops in it. In the back half, a row of      pickling cukes, interplanted with some dill, climbed a      space-saving trellis. And in the front was a double row of      green beans. Although the box eventually looked pretty      crowded, all of the plants stayed healthy throughout the      summer.    </p>    <p>      In general, though, a rule of thumb for the container      gardener is <em>oversow and then thin ruthlessly</em> . I      learned that lesson when my unthinned chard never got more      than nine inches tall - puny in comparison to the      lush fronds I'd grown in my raised-bed past.    </p>    <p>      Another danger to vegetable vitality - particularly      for squashes and their cousins - is transplant shock.      I sowed six yellow squash seeds in each of two five-gallon      buckets and then, about a month later, carefully (or so I      thought) transplanted all but one plant from each bucket      into other containers. The two undisturbed plants remained      hardy and produced well, but their transplanted siblings      were stunted and never bore fruit. Except for tomatoes,      peppers, and other tropically inclined cultivars that      appreciate a start indoors, rooftop garden crops can (and,      I found, <em>should</em> ) be started in the same      containers in which they'll mature.    </p>    <h3>      MAINTENANCE    </h3>    <p>      The most important word in the container gardener's      maintenance vocabulary is <em>water</em> - or more      precisely, <em>watering</em> , which is what I ended up      doing almost daily throughout June, July, and August. The      high heat and low humidity of the rooftop environment      caused my green charges to be much thirstier than their      earth-bound counterparts would be. When you add those two      factors to the others that were at work - low      moisture retention (in even the best tubs), shallow root      sys tems, and a Sahara-dry summer - it's no wonder I      lugged at least ten gallons of water up to my rooftop      garden every day the sun shone. (Looking back, ten gallons      a day doesn't seem to be all that much . . . but an outside      faucet and a hose sure would've helped.)    </p>        <p>      Container gardens also have special fertilization needs,      mostly because the soil isn't a part of a natural      nutrient-building environment the way the soil in a "real"      garden is. My vegetables and flowers gradually used up the      nutrients in their pure compost . . . and I'm sure the      daily waterings washed some nutrients out through the pots'      drain holes, too. So, around the end of June, I started      adding weekly doses of fish emulsion and liquid kelp to the      water. Potent commercial fertilizers might have produced      greener, lusher growth, but I couldn't imagine having a      nonorganic garden - even one growing in      petrochemical-based plastic buckets!    </p>    <h3>      A FEW PROBLEMS    </h3>    <p>      Being organically <em>in</em> clined, I also <em>de</em>      clined to grab a bottle of bootleg DDT at the first sight      of cabbageworms chomping their way through my collards.      Instead, I sent many of the little rascals splatting to      their ignoble ends on the parking lot below. But since      there were a lot of them and only one of me, and because      they are good at hiding, I finally resorted to a few      applications of <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> , a      microorganism that gives caterpillars a terminal case of      upset stomach. The only other noxious insects that came      calling were aphids (on a stunted kale plant; aphids always      know which garden crop is the weakest) and a few Mexican      bean beetles - but neither pest became much of a      problem.    </p>    <p>      My pail-grown produce also escaped the ravages of disease,      even though the plants occasionally suffered from moisture      stress (whenever I was away for a few days and unable to      water). Moisture-stressed plants are usually more      susceptible to disease (and insect) attack, but mine came      through admirably. Weeds weren't a problem either; only a      few emerged from the leaf-and-grass-clipping compost.    </p>    <p>      One minor problem that did need attention developed after      some plants became rootbound and the dirt shrank away from      the sides of the tubs. I had to tamp new soil down into the      gaps; otherwise, at watering time the liquid would have      washed right over the edge of the compacted compost, down      the sides, and out the drain holes.    </p>    <h3>      LOOKING BACK    </h3>    <p>      Some gardeners - like some fishermen and hunters      - find more pleasure in the process than in the      harvest. Doing becomes its own reward.    </p>    <p>      So it was with me and my rooftop flower-and-vegetable      patch. The yields <em>were</em> less than spectacular.      Sure, I had more lettuce than I knew what to do with. The      peppers were prolific. There were lots of scallions in the      spring and more than enough cherry tomatoes throughout the      summer. And I usually had a meal's worth of collards and      kale every week. But I still had to <em>buy</em> most of my      fresh veggies downstairs - from the co-op's produce      case.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, my pot-bound plantation was fun. And it was a      learning experience that I can draw upon again, <em>if</em>      I ever have to (fortunately, I've since moved to a place in      the country where there's lots of <em>ground-level</em>      growing space). But most important, my container garden      gave me a place to relax and restore my spirit. Lounging      among the plants on that roof, watching the bees move from      flower to flower, I felt as though the city streets were      miles - instead of just two stories - away.    </p>
