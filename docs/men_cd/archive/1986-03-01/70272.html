                    <p>      <em>The pioneering work of a dedicated group of      biodynamic/French-intensive horticulturists promises to      help improve the productivity and weal of family farmers      everywhere.</em>    </p>        <p>      Thomas Jefferson, bless his idealistic soul, is probably      churning in his grave over the present plight of family      farming in America. It was Jefferson's dream, you know,      that America become a country of independent      "freeholders"-self-supporting, landowning folk like      family farmers. Well, we almost made it, way back before      the industrial revolution and the advent of modern      agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and      large-scale corporate farming.    </p>    <p>      Many, if not most, Americans-and certainly we here at THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>-would like nothing better than to      see the 20thcentury trend toward large-scale, absentee-wned      farms reversed; we'd like to see the independent,      owner-operator farmers of America (who, by and large, make      far better stewards of the land than do faceless      corporations) come once again to the fore.    </p>    <p>      But before that can happen-before better can win out over      bigger-America's small-scale farmers are going to      have to learn to do more with less . . . specifically, to      grow more and better crops on less land, using less (and      less expensive) equipment to do it.    </p>    <p>      Well, out on the semiarid plains of eastern Colorado, a      small group of dedicated horticulturists is working to do      just that produce more food on less land, employing more      human labor and less nonorganic fertilizers and high-dollar      equipment. The group calls itself the Deep Bed Farming      Society (DBFS), and its plan is to adapt the phenomenally      efficient techniques of biodynamic/French-intensive      gardening to the larger-scale needs of independent      farmers-especially the grain and legume growers of      the Midwest.    </p>    <p>      According to DBFS president Steve White-hill, the group's      three specific goals are [1] to promote, encourage, and      support small, family-run farming operations; [2] to      protect the ecological integrity of rural areas; and [3] to      help assure that worldwide there would be sufficient      quantities of locally produced food.    </p>    <p>      And how does DBFS hope to achieve these goals? Quite      simply, by developing ways to make small-scale, organic      farming not just solvent, but lucrative. This, they      hope-through the workings of supply and      demand-will draw more people (and the right sort of      people) back onto America's farmlands as owner-operators      (Jefersonian freeholders).    </p>    <p>      To date, DBFS members have conducted extensive comparative      studies using test plots consisting of experimental      biodynamic deep beds planted alongside conventional rows of      corn, soybeans, and milo. The results indicate that DBFS is      onto something good, with peracre deep-bed yields doubling      and occasionally even quadrupling those of the neighboring      conventional rows.    </p>    <p>      We'll try to keep you posted on the organization's progress      (they'll soon be setting up a working model of an organic      deep-bed farm somewhere in the Midwest). But for now, if      you'd like to get more information on this group of doers,      write to the Deep Bed Farming Society, 939 6th St., Las      Animas, CO 81054. (As a nonprofit organization, DBFS      depends on contributions and member support to survive, and      welcomes queries from prospective members or donors.)    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For a report on another "organic      alternative" designed to alleviate the crisis facing      America's family farmers, turn back to the Plowboy      Interview on page 16.</em>    </p>
