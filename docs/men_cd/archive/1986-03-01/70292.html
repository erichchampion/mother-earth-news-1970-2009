                    <p>      <em>You may have heard that these little beauties can't be      started from seed. Don't believe a word of it!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Patricia H. Morris    </h5>    <p>      For many years, my neighbor kept a three-foot row of      primroses growing at the end of her sun porch. Each spring,      with all the certainty of the changing seasons themselves,      those three rows would explode into a single mass of      sunshine yellow blossoms with buttery orange eyes. And,      each spring, I <em>coveted.</em>    </p>    <p>      I thought about attempting to grow my own primroses from      scratch-until I did some research and was advised,      over and over again, that the flowers are considered      <em>very</em> difficult to start from seed. For one thing,      many varieties require a period of postplanting freezing to      break dormancy. What's more, I learned that primroses are      slow and erratic germinators. In general, starting      primroses from seed is not a project generally recommended      for the novice flower gardener- which, at that time,      I most certainly was.    </p>    <p>      Then one winter's day, while studying the seed catalogs in      anticipation of spring planting, I spotted a listing for      something called Pacific Giant primrose, which flowered in      shades running from crisp white and creamy yellow through      varying hues of blue to satiny pinks and reds. And this      variety of primrose, the catalog claimed, was somewhat      easier to start from seed than most. I ordered a packet.    </p>    <p>      When the mail carrier delivered my primrose seeds, I put      them aside for the moment and turned my attention to      planting my vegetable garden and trimming it with a border      of the annuals I had found so reliable and easy to start in      years past. But the day finally came when the "sure and      easy" planting was done, and I had to face up to the task      I'd set for myself.    </p>    <p>      THE GREAT PRIMROSE CHALLENGE    </p>    <p>      Having experienced, in previous years, the devastating      seedling losses that various fungal diseases can cause, I      began my planting preparations by carefully washing the      tray I planned to use for sprouting the primroses; then I      rinsed it with a mild chlorine solution.    </p>    <p>      The next step was to fill the tray with a 50/50 mix of      sphagnum moss and vermiculite and then to place it in an      inch of water in the kitchen sink. After a couple of hours,      when the planting mix had absorbed most of the water, I      removed it from the sink to drain while I prepared lunch.    </p>    <p>      After lunch, I retrieved my precious packet of potential      primroses and carefully sprinkled the seed, in rows, in the      tray of prepared soil. Since the seeds were tiny, I dusted      them with a light covering of vermiculite . . . just enough      to hide the seed from sight. Then I slipped the tray into a      plastic bag, closed the end, and placed it in the freezer.    </p>    <p>      After two weeks, I removed the planting tray from the      freezer, punched a few holes in the plastic bag for      ventilation, and placed it in a north-facing window, where      it would receive indirect light-but no direct, hot      sunshine-and where I could conveniently watch for      seedlings to appear.    </p>    <p>      At long last-nearly two weeks after I'd removed the      container from the freezer-I saw the first fat little      seedling leaves pushing up through the vermiculite. Excited      at this longawaited development, I removed the plastic      cover and moved the tray to a south-facing kitchen window,      where there was plenty of sunlight. By the end of the week      I was rewarded with a healthy stand of sprouts.    </p>    <p>      After a few more days I decided that the young plants      needed more sunlight and fresh air than they were receiving      in my kitchen window, so I moved them to the corner of an      empty cold frame and rigged a piece of wire screen over the      top to conserve moisture and shade the plants from the      intense summer sun. As further proof against damage from      Old Sol, I prepared a solution of water containing a trace      of nonburning fertilizer and used this to keep the soil in      the plants' tray damp at all times (but never soggy).    </p>    <p>      By the first of August the baby primroses had formed tiny      rosettes of leaves and seemed ready for      transplanting-so I moved them to a nursery bed at the      edge of the garden and rigged a cheesecloth tent to shade      them until they became accustomed to their new home.    </p>    <p>      As soon as the little primroses had taken hold (with new      growth as evidence), I removed the cheesecloth. I continued      to water the plants during dry spells and watched as new      leaves pushed up from the centers and flattened out to form      dainty little whorls.    </p>    <p>      Toward the end of September I decided to prepare permanent      homes for my primroses. Having read that these delicate      flowers prefer shade and moisture, I chose spots that I      knew would be partially shaded during summer, then turned      lots of compost and peat moss into the soil. With the beds      ready, I did the final transplanting . . . and watched the      plants flourish in their new homes.    </p>    <p>      Even when the fall rains came, my primroses kept growing,      some forming flat-topped plants four inches across before      freezing weather arrived. When the soil was finally frozen,      I covered the plants with a few inches of straw held in      place with a layer of evergreen boughs, and wished my      primmies a cozy winter's sleep.    </p>    <p>      Early the following March, when the snow had melted and      daytime temperatures began to rise above freezing, I      removed the straw-a little at a time, and only on      cloudy days-to gradually introduce the fresh, green,      crinkly leaves to the sun.    </p>    <p>      Near the end of March the first bud opened to cast a lovely      yellow-and from then through May the little spots of      rose, gold, lilac, and red kept me entranced. In fact, the      thrill of vibrant color so surpassed anything I had      expected when I made out that order for primrose seed the      year before that I vowed never again to be without my      lovely harbingers of spring.    </p>    <p>      I want to encourage any fellow primrose fanciers out there      to go ahead: Ignore those who say it can't be done, and      make the small investment in money, time, and effort      required to try growing primrose from seed.    </p>    <p>      There's very little to lose, and a great deal to      gain-not the least of which is the satisfaction of      proving those naysaying "experts" wrong!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Although there are many varieties of      primroses, Pacific Giant appears to be the best bet for      novice growers; it is both hardy and relatively easy to      start from seed. Two sources for the seed are the Geo. W.      Park Seed Company (P.0. Box 31, Greenwood, SC 29647) and      Burpee Seed Company (300 Park Ave., Warminster, PA 18974).      Both offer free catalogs.</em>    </p>
