                    <h5 id="byline">      by Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>    <hr />    <h3>      SPECIAL YIELD-BOOSTING TREATMENTS    </h3>    <p>      Recently, we've collected quite a few ideas concerning      doing "strange" things to vegetable seeds and seedlings to      try to increase yields. All of these suggestions are based      on research reports from professional      horticulturists-but that's no guarantee that they'll      work for you. In fact, we're hoping that readers of THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> will experiment with these techniques and      let us know their results! (Just remember to grow a few      untreated "control" plants to compare to your experimental      ones.)    </p>    <p>      Russian scientists have seen yield increases of up to 88%      after soaking the seeds of some tomato varieties in a      6.5°10 solution of <em>skimmed milk</em> . Another      tomato seed treatment (reported by Egyptian researchers)      for boosting yields is to heat air-dried seeds for two      hours at 140° F: Apparently, the heat changes the      proportions of natural growth regulators in the plants.    </p>    <p>      A Netherlands experimenter has found that thinning peppers      to leave only a few fruits at the initial fruit-setting      stage increases yields and average fruit size. Canadian      researchers reported large yield increases for cowpeas that      were "beheaded" between the fourth and fifth leaves on the      main stem when the fifth leaf reached full size. The      decapitation also made the plants more compact. (Might this      technique work with soybeans or green beans?) Similarly,      Cornell University horticulturists found that removing the      growing tip from a tomato plant when it has four or five      leaves delays first flowering two to five days, but then      creates simultaneous flowering of several branch clusters      and hence higher "second-earliest" yields.    </p>    <p>      Research indicates that if you're growing your own      transplants, you should <em>not</em> skimp on container      size: Many vegetables produce larger yields when started in      roomier pots. And several studies have shown beneficial      results from watering just-transplanted vegetables with      seaweed extracts . . . which seem to help minimize      transplanting shock.    </p>    <p>      Plant growth regulators added to seeds can also sometimes      have positive effects. Researchers in India reported that      soaking onion seeds in a solution of NAAm, or      naphthaleneacetamide, at a concentration of 20 parts per      million for eight hours prior to planting boosted onion      yields by nearly 60%. Soaking the seeds in a gibberellic      acid solution (7.5 parts per million) increased yields by      about 20%.    </p>    <p>      There seems to be no end to the experiments you can do with      seeds and seedlings!    </p>    <h3>      RESEARCH BRIEFS    </h3>    <p>      Harvest spinach at dawn? Researchers at Tokyo University      report daily fluctuations in the mineral content of spinach      leaves. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium      levels were found to start dropping after sunrise, hit a      minimum in late afternoon, then increase to a maximum at      dawn. So if you want the most minerals possible from your      spinach, you'll have to get up early!    </p>
