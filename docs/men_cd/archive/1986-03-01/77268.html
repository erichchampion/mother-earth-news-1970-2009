                <p>      <strong>Folks, Facts,& Folklore</strong>    </p>        <h3>      Stooper Stopper    </h3>        <p>      When planting time came around last year, wife Frances said      to me, "Clif, can't you rig me up something so I won't have      to be stooping all the time?" So I picked up a 3-1/2-foot      length of 1-inch tubing that was lying around, cut a      half-gallon plastic milk jug in half, and then wedged the      spout end of the carton down into the tube and secured it      with electrical tape. It's no big deal, but Frances says it      works just dandy: faster sowing, better seed spacing, and      best of all - no stooping! <em>-Clif E. Truman,      Haltom City, Texas</em>    </p>    <h3>      Drip-Grind Ground    </h3>        <p>      When it came time to transplant 500 aloe vera plants I was      selling, I was faced with the problem of plugging the four      holes in each of the one-gallon pots the plants were being      moved to: I wanted to insure good drainage while losing as      little soil as possible. My solution? A generic brand of      coffee filters! <em>-Kenn Roman, Phoenix,      Arizona</em>    </p>    <h3>      Deep Tree Bends    </h3>        <p>      I was proud when I first planted my fruit trees. Every time      I passed them on my way to putting out the garbage, I got a      special feeling. Then several years passed without a single      one bearing fruit, and a new feeling started to come over      me: a murderous, ax-wielding kind of feeling. Luckily, I      heard of this trick just in time. Early in the spring (as      soon as it's warm enough for your fingers to tie string),      bend a young branch of each tree into an arc and tie it      down. Then just leave it be until the following spring,      when you'll cut the string. In the meantime, new fruit      stems should have developed all along the bent branch.      Believe me, it works - it saved my fruit trees and my      sanity! <em>- W. Gorka, Hamtramck, Michigan</em>    </p>    <h3>      Managing Manure    </h3>        <p>      We go to a neighbor's barnyard every spring and get old      manure for our garden plot. Last year I got tired of      struggling with the hard-packed fertilizer and ended up      running my tiller over it at about half-throttle. It really      made a difference! Chopped up fine, the manure was much      easier to dig up and load. <em>- Clinton Youts,      Center, Colorado</em>    </p>    <h3>      It's No Yolk!    </h3>        <p>      Since moving onto our homestead six years ago, we've      gleaned many helpful hints from the pages of MOTHER. So we      thought we'd reciprocate with this bit of country lore for      maple syrup makers. Once the syrup reaches about 220Â°F      and is almost finished, break an egg into the bubbling sap      and let it boil for a few minutes. When you remove the egg,      a lot of the impurities will come out with it, and you      won't have to strain the syrup as much. <em>-      Margaret Kucharek, Grayling, Michigan</em>    </p>    <h3>      Can It    </h3>        <p>      With warm weather just around the corner, it'll soon be      time to put away your sweaters, mittens, and other woolens.      I've found that a new plastic garbage can makes a great      "storage chest" for such items. Find one with a      tight-fitting lid, and your clothes will be dry and      mothproof. <em>- Grace Haddad, North Royalton,      Ohio</em>    </p>    <h3>      Drop in the Bucket    </h3>        <p>      I was trying to sleep through a torrential rainstorm one      night, when my roof sprang a leak. Well, the rythmic pings      of the drops hitting the pan I stuck under the drip didn't      do much for my attempts to doze off, and I hated to think      about what the water splashing out of the pan was doing to      my wooden floor. Then I hit on an emergency solution: I cut      a piece of twine as long as my ceiling was high and      thumbtacked one end to the spot where the drops were      forming. I placed the other end in the pan and, to and      behold, no more racket! It was only a temporary fix, but it      got me a good night's sleep. <em>- Pamela Cobberg,      Albuquerque, New Mexico</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, down-home, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday life.
