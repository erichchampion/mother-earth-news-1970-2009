                      <h5 id="byline">by Malcolm Margolin    </h5>    <p>      A visitor from outer space might have a good laugh at how      we handle - or don't handle - erosion. Our      homes have locks on the door, latches on the window, and      insurance policies in the dresser drawer, and we support a      huge police and prison system - largely to protect a      few cameras, watches, and other gewgaws. Meanwhile, outside      our windows, every rainstorm carries away thousands of tons      of valuable topsoil upon which we depend for our very      survival. Our scale of values is pathetically confused,      when you stop to think about it. With modern assembly-line      methods, we could replace a stolen stereo in a few hours.      Yet it takes nature almost a thousand years to rebuild one      inch of topsoil.    </p>    <p>      Some people, especially farmers, have a fatalistic attitude      toward erosion. Land erodes, they feel, just as people grow      old, automobiles sputter and stall, and apple trees      eventually give out. But land is not like that. It does not      have to erode. In fact, a healthy land adds humus and      builds up its fertility every year. Individual plants and      animals die, giving up their lives to help build a healthy,      vital, growing soil for future generations of plants and      animals. This nourishing of the soil is what makes death      meaningful and even beautiful. Think about that for a      moment, and don't accept erosion as a "fact of life."    </p>    <p>      Another conceptual trap you can fall into is the "Grand      Canyon argument." Erosion built the Grand Canyon, so the      argument goes, implying that erosion is a natural process      that should not be interfered with. But erosion is      "natural" only in desertlike areas where there is too      little rainfall to maintain a thick growth of vegetation.      When the rain does come, it is often in raging torrents      that wash away the sparsely vegetated soil and create the      dramatic canyons and badlands of the American West.      Elsewhere, however, erosion is unnatural, the result of      man's misuse of the land.    </p>    <p>      I have an almost missionary zeal whenever I think of      erosion control. But there is one thing I should not gloss      over. Fighting erosion is a hard, heavy battle; and, as      with any other worthwhile battle, there's a good chance      that <em>you</em> will lose. Water erosion is a strong,      persistent enemy. It's a fascinating enemy too: crafty,      treacherous, sneaky, unforgiving, unforgetting, mindless,      and merciless. Supposedly you can make a pact with the      devil, but not with erosion.    </p>    <p>      In this article there are instructions for building check      dams, contour trenches, and wattles. Follow these      instructions and you'll have good reason to expect success.      Most of the time. But there is also a good chance that an      exceptionally heavy rain, exceptionally unstable soil, or a      minor fault in construction will allow the water to wash      your structure right away. When that happens, what are you      left with? If you and whoever works with you did not enjoy      the experience of working together, you are left with      nothing. Less than nothing! But if the experience of      building and planting was warm, cooperative, compassionate,      and friendly, the project was a success whether the check      dams hold or not.    </p>    <p>      As an engineering venture, you should build your structures      as if they were going to last forever. Perhaps they will.      But as a spiritual venture you should treat the whole thing      as if success or failure of the structures is totally      irrelevant. Make sure the process is human and loving, have      fun, and open your eyes to the here and now. Saving soil is      important, but not at the expense of losing a group of kids      or a group of friends.    </p>    <h3>      HOW EROSION HAPPENS    </h3>    <p>      In the following sections I tell you what deeds you must do      to fight erosion. But before you put on your coat of armor      and rush out of the house, let's stop for a minute to      examine the nature of the beast. Here is a model of      atypically eroding watershed.    </p>    <p>      To begin at the beginning, drops of rain fall down. Plip,      plip, plip. They hit the ground at a speed of about 30 feet      a second. If your land is healthy and the raindrops fall      onto a thickly carpeted meadow, a wonderful thing happens.      It is something you have to see to appreciate fully. The      next time it begins to rain, try to forget everything your      mother taught you about "catching your death of cold," lie      down on your belly, nestle your chin into the grass, and      get a frog's-eye view of how raindrops fall. You'll see how      the raindrops hit the individual blades of grass, causing      them to bend down. This bending absorbs the energy of the      raindrop, and the raindrop slides gently off the blade of      grass, which immediately springs up again, waiting to catch      another raindrop. Perhaps it's just my own sense of humor,      but the sight of hundreds of blades of grass bowing down      and popping back up like piano keys strikes me as one of      the merriest sights in the world; I've spent embarrassing      amounts of time rolling around on wet meadows in the rain,      laughing at the wonderful antics of the blades of grass.    </p>    <p>      After the energy of the raindrop is taken up by the grass,      the raindrop slides gently to the ground. On a healthy      meadow with lots of humus, the ground is spongy and      absorbent and the raindrop quickly sinks out of sight.    </p>    <p>      A similar thing happens in a forest. As every kid knows,      the best place to run when a sudden rain comes is under a      tree - unless, of course, there is thunder and      lightning. The leaves of the tree break the raindrops into      a fine mist. What moisture does fall through the canopy is      easily absorbed by the understory, the leaf litter, and the      humus, and it too sinks gently into the ground.    </p>    <p>      But let's say that the ground has been logged, grazed,      burned, cultivated, or otherwise disturbed. There are now      bare patches of earth. When the raindrops hit a bare spot,      they strike full force, like tiny hammers, and splatter the      soil. This splattering breaks up clods of earth into fine      particles. The raindrops hold the fine particles in      suspension. As the water sinks into the soil, these fine      particles get filtered out and soon clog up and seal the      passageways through which the water would ordinarily flow.      The clogging and sealing effect is very important: Clear      water percolates through the soil ten times faster than      muddy water. After a brief time the soil becomes crusty and      impenetrable, and the water can no longer sink in. Instead,      it forms puddles on the surface.    </p>    <p>      On flat land, the puddles loiter around, grow bigger, and      form temporary ponds. The soil structure is damaged      somewhat, but there is no real erosion.    </p>    <p>      On slopes, however, the water flows downhill over the      surface of the ground, evenly, like a sheet. It carries      dirt particles dislodged from the tops of hills and      deposits them below, creating what is known as <em>sheet      erosion</em> .    </p>    <p>      Probably the worst thing that can happen at this point is      that the flow of water becomes channelized, either because      of the topography of the land or because of an accidental      occurrence like a furrow, a tire rut, or a cow path running      downhill. The water gathers speed and the particles of dirt      act like sandpaper. The water soon cuts a small trench, or      rill, which it may eventually widen and deepen into a      gully.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, a gully is really the result of erosion      - not the cause. Yet once the gully gets established,      it brings about many severe problems. With each rainstorm,      it gets deeper and deeper until it may even cut below the      level of the groundwater, draining it and lowering the      water table.    </p>    <p>      We now have the beginning of a vicious cycle. As you      probably know, much deep-rooted vegetation depends more on      groundwater than on surface water from the rain. As the      water table is lowered - both from lack of rainwater      penetration and from the draining action of gullies -      vegetation over the watershed becomes more meager and      scruffier. In some places fields of thick grasses are      replaced entirely by sagebrush and chaparral, with scraggly      growth and much exposed soil. Less groundwater leads to      scruffy vegetation, which leads to more bare soil, which      leads to more splatter, more soil clogging, less water      penetration, more runoff, and a further deepening of the      gully. As the gully deepens, it drains the water table      still more, producing a further loss of vegetation, more      exposed soil, more splatter, and so on for another downward      cycle.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, as the gully gets deeper, the earth along its      banks begins to cave in. Soon the gully sends out fingers      that spread over the meadow, eating steadily away at the      soil.    </p>    <p>      Within a few years, thousands of tons of topsoil are washed      away, along with thousands of tons of subsoil. Where does      it all go? Eventually, the gully probably drains into a      stream. On a healthy watershed, a good cover of vegetation      absorbs water, holds it like a sponge, and releases it      gradually into the stream. The stream runs steadily and      cleanly. But on an eroding watershed, the water runs off      the surface with a heavy load of suspended silt, swoops      through the gullies, and flushes out into the stream after      every rainstorm. Instead of a clear, even-flowing stream,      there is now an intermittent dry creek given over to flash      floods. The silt kills whatever life there is in the stream      and acts like sandpaper to cut into the stream bed and      banks, causing further damage.    </p>    <p>      Sound dismal? It is! Yet this is exactly what is happening      to thousands of small watersheds around the country. You      should be aware of this process, but if your land has a few      gullies, please don't freak out. Gullies can be stopped,      and even if the "vicious cycle" has begun, you can do a lot      to reverse it. That's what this article is about: how to      stop erosion without a lot of money, bulldozers, or a      detachment from the Corps of Engineers.    </p>		    <p>      So far I've given you a model of a typically eroding      watershed, which should help you to conceptualize what's      happening on your land. If all you're going to do is think      about erosion, you can stop here. But if you're going to      <em>do</em> something about it, you'll need a gutlevel      feeling for how erosion is happening on your land. This      feeling, more than anything you read, will tell you where      to plant, where to mulch, where to build check dams, and      where to stay out of the way. It'll prevent you from      building a matchstick structure to stop a raging torrent,      and it'll save you the trouble of building a Hoover Dam to      control a trickle.    </p>    <p>      In short, you've got to get wet! You've got to go out in      the rain, lie belly down on your meadows, squish soil and      mud through your fingers, look at the color of your water,      and poke at the sides of your gullies to see how solid they      are. Water is amazing stuff, and to see what it does,      you've got to get intimately acquainted with it.    </p>    <p>      A firsthand understanding of how your land is (or isn't)      eroding will have its side benefits. It'll get you out in      the rain, which is sort of magical in its own right. It      will also give you an appreciation for the strength,      determination, and beauty of the erosion process. If you      are going to fight erosion, it's much better to fight a      beautiful enemy that you admire rather than an ugly enemy      you hardly know.    </p>    <p>      One more thing. The Soil Conservation Service is an      excellent ally in fighting erosion. You can find it by      looking in the phone book under U.S. Government, Department      of Agriculture. I've called upon these people for various      meadow, forest, stream, and gully problems. They have sent      me (free!) grassland experts, stream experts, and soil      engineers - persons who knew their subject well and      who gave me not only advice but usable advice at that. My      own good experiences with the Soil Conservation Service may      have been accidental, but by all means give it a try.    </p>    <h3>      FIGHTING EROSION WITH PLANTS    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Of structures and plants.</strong> Later on, I'll      explain how to build structures that will stop erosion and      hold soil together. Building these structures can be fun,      like playing with an oversized erector set, but please      don't get hung up on them. The Army Corps of Engineers      seems to view erosion-control structures as monuments, and      in many places its cement bulwarks are even more prominent      and obtrusive than the original erosion. Don't make that      mistake. The structures I recommend are merely temporary,      even rinky-dink, devices to hold the soil together until a      permanent vegetative cover can get established.    </p>    <p>      The only successful and lasting way to fight erosion is      with plants. One of the nicest things about using plants is      that plants want to fight erosion. In fact, they want to      fight erosion even more than you do, and what's more, they      know how to do it. Take a blade of grass. Grass depends for      its survival upon topsoil, and over the last several      million years it has developed ways of holding on to and      increasing the earth's supply of topsoil. Grass intercepts      raindrops; it forms a tough, tangled mat that prevents      raindrops from flowing downhill; its fibrous roots embrace      the soil and hold it together. Decaying roots create      passageways through which water can penetrate, while      transpiration allows the grass to pump water out of the      soil before the soil gets waterlogged. At the end of its      life, grass falls to the ground, decays, and becomes humus,      which is the best of all possible elements in the topsoil.      Plants depend upon a healthy soil, and they have learned      how to serve and preserve that soil. Every time you drop a      seed into the ground, you are introducing an ally with      millions of years of genetic experience in fighting erosion      and tremendous willingness to put that experience to use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Temporary cover.</strong> The first thing you      should think about when you are faced with an erosion      problem is a temporary (or emergency) cover. You will      eventually want to plant a permanent cover of native plants      that will perpetuate themselves and restore the soil. But      if you have a lot of bare land and an immediate danger of      erosion, you have to act fast. You need some sort of      temporary vegetation just to hold things together until the      permanent vegetation can get established.    </p>    <p>      Certain plants have a special capacity for stopping      erosion. I wish I could tell you exactly what you should      plant on your land - I know it would make your life      easier - but I can't. There are too many variables. I      know that in the hills above Oakland I can get good results      with a mixture of rye, barley, trefoil, mustard, and a few      other flowers. But I doubt if this information will help      you if you're in Indiana, Georgia, Vermont, or Alaska.    </p>    <p>      All I can do is give you general advice about what you      should look for in an emergency cover plant. For the      specifics you'll need local guidance from your Soil      Conservation Service, your county agricultural extension      agent, your local hermit and organic gardener, or your      local seed dealer (who often has a special "erosion-control      mix"). Or you can look into some of the books I recommend      at the end of this article which give a species-by-species      rundown of many valuable erosion-control plants and tell      where they can be used.    </p>    <p>      The ideal erosion stopper is a plant that [1] germinates      quickly and easily; [2] grows fast <em>before</em> the      first heavy rains; [3] has a dense, fibrous root system;      [4] is frost resistant; [5] is temporary - make sure      the recommended "wonder plant" won't take over everything      in sight; and [6] is a mixture. Don't depend on one plant,      no matter how good its reputation. And make certain that at      least one element of the mixture is a legume (member of the      pea family). Legumes do for the soil what yogurt does for      the intestines - they foster lots of beneficial      microorganisms that do much of the real heroics in creating      healthy soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>How to plant a temporary cover.</strong> The best      way to establish a temporary cover is first to dress the      ground with a light sprinkling of very well rotted manure      or compost. You might want to work it into the soil a      little bit with a hoe and then rake it some - but not      too deeply, please. If you have erosion, you want to      disturb the soil as little as possible. Once you've      prepared the soil, simply broadcast the seeds a day or two      before you expect rain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fertilizers and exotics.</strong> What if you are      dealing with a huge area, or if you don't have enough      manure or compost for even a small area? Here's what you      do. Scratch the surface of the ground slightly with a rake.      Then spread the seed before you expect a rain. Wait until      the seed has germinated and growth is under way, then      carefully add an appropriate chemical fertilizer. (The Soil      Conservation Service or a local seed dealer will tell you      how much seed to scatter and what kind of fertilizer is      "appropriate.")    </p>    <p>      Aside from chemical fertilizer, there is another bitter      pill you may have to swallow. Some of the most effective      plants for erosion control are exotic grasses and clovers.      Call me a native-plant chauvinist, but I normally abhor      foreign exotics. I have very high standards about not using      them. For that matter, I have very high standards about not      forcing growth with chemical fertilizers. Yet when the soil      is bare and the rains are due, I am faced with a clear      choice: I can either hang on to my standards, or I can hang      on to my topsoil. Standards can be replaced, rationalized,      or even forgotten within a week. Topsoil takes thousands of      years to form. Whenever I've had to make a choice, I've      opted in favor of topsoil.    </p>    <p>      If you do decide to use an exotic, there are special      guidelines you should follow. Make sure the exotic has been      around for a long time and is well tested in your area.      Make especially certain that it won't escape and spread all      over the place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>After seeding.</strong> If your land is relatively      flat, you can seed and forget. But what if you're working      on a steep slope where the soil is so unstable that you're      afraid it will wash away, or where the land is so hard that      you think the seeds might simply float down the hill? In      such cases you'll have to devise some way of holding the      seeds and earth in place - at least until the seeds      germinate, the roots work their way into the soil, and the      green stuff rises up like flags of victory to tell you      everything is going well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Willow stakes.</strong> In the following sections I      describe several structures that will hold the soil      together for a while. You can use any materials to build      these structures, but if you use willow cuttings, you will      reap an extraordinary advantage. Not only will they serve a      mundane mechanical function as posts or stakes, but they      will very likely sprout, send down roots, help bind the      soil, and carry on an exuberant and useful existence of      their own. Willows are especially valuable wherever you're      dealing with moist land and bad drainage.    </p>    <p>      In addition to willows, there are other cuttings you can      use for living stakes or posts. In our part of California,      for example, elderberries and "mule fat" sprout easily from      cuttings. Under hard conditions they may last for only one      or two seasons - but while they last they'll do a lot      of good.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Black locusts.</strong> The black locust is not an      insect; it's a tree with a supergood reputation for erosion      control. It establishes itself on poor, dry sites, has a      spectacular rate of growth and a good root structure, and      adds a lot of nitrogen to depleted soil. It is not unusual      for a three-year-old locust to be 15 feet tall with a root      system spreading 25 feet.    </p>    <p>      You can plant locusts as seedlings or from root cuttings.      For erosion control, plant them close together - say,      five feet by five feet, or even three feet by three feet in      really bad places.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Permanent vegetation.</strong> Temporary vegetation      is meant to give out, and even willows and locusts are not      usually climax species. You should plan for what you hope      the permanent vegetation will be. Talk it over with your      land. Find out what was there before the land was misused.      Decide whether the land can support its climax vegetation,      or whether you should begin further down the line of      succession. I can't advise you what to plant - it      varies from one area to another, and in fact from one acre      to the next - but by studying uneroded, undisturbed      land in your neighborhood, you should be able to figure it      out.    </p>    <p>      The best time to plant a permanent vegetation is just as      soon as the temporary vegetation has stabilized things      - usually toward the end of the first rainy season.    </p>    <h3>      CONQUERING THE SPLATTER    </h3>    <p>      It may sound silly and quixotic to you, but if you are      going to control erosion, you must begin by fighting      raindrops. Raindrops hammer insistently at your land, and      to prevent damage there are two things you must do. First,      you've got to make sure there is something waiting to      intercept the raindrops before they hit bare soil:      vegetation, if possible, or some sort of mulch. Secondly,      once the raindrops fall, you've got to stop them; corral      them, and let them sink into the ground. If, perhaps with      trenches, brush mats, or wattles, you can get the raindrops      to sink into the ground wherever they fall, there will be      no runoff, and thus no erosion.    </p>    <p>      How to recognize sheet erosion. Sheet erosion, according to      the people who measure such things, causes 80% of all      topsoil losses. Gullies cause only about 20%. Yet a gully      stands out like a wound, screaming for attention, while      sheet erosion happens so gradually, almost invisibly, that      it's hard to detect. You think everything is all right      until one day you wake up and realize that your topsoil is      gone. Sheet erosion is very insidious.    </p>    <p>      Is your land suffering from sheet erosion? Looking for      sheet erosion is a little bit like searching for a snake.      If you merely walk around, sniffing flowers and      lackadaisically enjoying whatever strikes your eye, you are      unlikely to see a snake. But if you make a special effort      to find one, turning over logs and stones, looking hard      between the blades of grass and around bushes, you will      probably find several snakes in a few hours.    </p>    <p>      The same is true of sheet erosion. You have to go out into      your fields with nothing else on your mind except looking      for sheet erosion. Don't get waylaid by flowers,      butterflies, or ripe strawberries. Keep your mind on your      task. Climb to the top of a hill, forget about the view,      and look down at the soil. Here is what you should be      looking for.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BALD SPOTS</strong> on the hilltops and slopes,      often with a buildup of fertile soil down below.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EXPOSED ROOTS</strong> Roots of trees, shrubs, and      other plants do not <em>grow</em> out of the ground. If the      roots are exposed, it is because the soil has been washed      away.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STAINS ON OLD FENCE POSTS</strong> These sometimes      show that the soil was once deeper than it now is.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EXPOSED ROCK</strong> If you feel that your meadows      have been getting rockier and rockier each year, unless      your land is a gathering spot for meteorites, this is a      sign that the soil is being washed away.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mulch.</strong> Once you discover sheet erosion,      don't waste too much time either admiring it or bemoaning      it. Get the right mixture of seeds, put them in a wide,      shallow basket, and go skipping across your meadows like      Ceres strewing the seed. Be joyful - and the seed,      the land, and perhaps the universe will respond to your      joy.    </p>    <p>      In most places you can seed and forget. But if the soil is      loose and unstable, or if it is so hard that you're afraid      the seed will wash off, or if the slope is exceptionally      steep, you should apply a mulch after you've seeded. A      light covering of mulch does wonders. It cushions the      impact of the raindrops, like those blades of grass, and      allows the water to settle in gradually. It creates a      network of little dams on the ground that impound the water      and prevent it from getting a running start down the hill.      It absorbs water. And as it decays, it adds organic matter      that eroding land usually needs so desperately.    </p>    <p>      But remember: Underneath the mulch are seeds, and you want      to encourage, not smother, their growth. So keep the mulch      covering thin - no more than an inch or two -      and avoid any mulch that tends to mat down.    </p>    <p>      Straw is far and away the best mulch you can get for      erosion control. But don't be too fussy; other mulches also      work very well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Brush mats.</strong> Brush mats are for really      nasty places - places where you want to use a mulch      but where the slope is so steep that you're afraid a loose      mulch will wash down the hill. Believe me, an eroding      hillside with a huge pile of soggy mulch at its base is a      nightmarish sight. The way to avoid it is to use brush as      your mulch and tie the brush together into mats.    </p>        <p>      To make a brush mat, first lay two wires parallel to each      other on the ground, about two feet apart. Lay the brush      over the wire. If you use fir boughs or pine boughs, pile      them very thin; otherwise, they'll smother the seed. If you      use sparser chaparral brush, you can make the mats as much      as six inches thick.    </p>    <p>      After you arrange the brush over the wires, bring the wires      back over the top of the brush. Use baling wire to connect      the upper and lower strands of wire. Pull them tightly      together and tie them off, making a connection every six      inches or so. The loose ends can be twisted tight with      pliers.    </p>    <p>      You now have a brush mat that will hold together very      effectively, even on quite steep slopes. If you want to be      extra safe, you can stake your brush mats down to the      ground - preferably with sproutable, rootable stakes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Contour trenches.</strong> Here is still another      technique you can use in addition to mulching. If by some      chance you don't have any mulch, you can sometimes use this      technique instead of mulching.    </p>    <p>      Contour trenches are simply ditches that you dig along a      hillside in such a way that they follow a contour and run      perpendicular to the flow of water. They catch water and      allow it to sink into the ground before it can get a      running start down the hill. Contour trenches are      particularly valuable on hardened soil - like old      logging roads - where water penetration is painfully      slow.    </p>    <p>      To make contour trenches, first gather all your friends and      issue them picks, mattocks, and shovels. When the moaning      and groaning stop, begin digging several short trenches      five or six inches deep and no more than about two or three      feet apart. Keep this project short! Digging ditches on a      hard-packed, heavily eroded slope is nobody's idea of great      fun.    </p>		        <p>      <strong>Brush wattles.</strong> Simple seeding, mulching,      brush mats, and contour trenches will take care of 98% of      your sheet erosion problems. For those rare times when you      have an exquisitely nasty and persistent problem with sheet      erosion, you can resort to brush wattles.    </p>    <p>      Begin by making a series of contour trenches at least eight      inches deep, preferably deeper. As you remove the dirt,      somehow, somewhere, get it out of the area. Next, lay some      brush in the trenches. Stagger the brush along the trench      so that it all interlocks, like strands within a rope. As      you build up the brush, stomp it hard so that it packs into      the trenches. If it keeps springing up, you can try cursing      it or packing it down with some dirt. The last several      pieces of brush that you lay in the trench should stick up      above the level of the land. To help keep the brush in      place, knock in stakes (preferably stakes capable of      growing) just behind the trench on the downhill side. Space      the stakes one foot, or at most two feet, apart. If you      have lots of long, limber branches, you should weave them      between the stakes to form a wattle fence.    </p>    <p>      What you're left with is admittedly a weird structure, and      one that is hard to build - especially on a steep,      unstable slope where you are most likely to need it. It      has, in fact, only one redeeming feature: It works! The      water running downhill sinks into the trenches. Silt      suspended in the water also gets caught in the trenches and      builds up within the protruding branches of the brush and      behind the wattle fence. A wattled slope soon forms little      terraces of relatively stable silty soil - excellent      places for plants to get a start.    </p>    <h3>      GULLIES    </h3>    <p>      Patrick Henry (of "liberty or death" fame) once said,      "Since the achievement of our independence, he is the      greatest patriot who stops the most gullies." I used to      think this statement a bit outlandish, but the more I've      gotten to know about land, gullies, and patriotism; the      more I've come to agree.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rills.</strong> The easiest way of stopping a gully      is to catch it early. Whenever you see small rills (or      channels), get right to work. Use a mattock or a hoe to      break them up. Work in some compost or rotted manure, if      you can, and rake the area smooth. Then treat the area as      you would for sheet erosion - seed it, mulch it, or      possibly use brush mats or contour trenches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gully monsters.</strong> A neglected rill may grow      up to be a monster gully. In the next two pages I'll tell      you how to go about fighting and conquering gullies. It's a      long, complicated fight, but very much worth the trouble.      We no longer have fire-eating dragons, but we do have      land-eating gullies to fight. Just to make sure you can      find your way through the following instructions, here is      an outline of the battle plans.    </p>    <p>      [1] Stabilize the gully bottom. The bottom is more      important than the sides. If the gully continues to dig      deeper, no matter what else you do, the sides will cave and      slump. You've got to prevent the gully from getting any      deeper, and you should even attempt to build up the bottom.    </p>    <p>      [2] Grade the walls of the gully to their <em>angle of      repose</em> - the angle at which they will no longer      slump or slide.    </p>    <p>      [3] Stop or reduce the flow of water entering the gully.    </p>    <p>      [4] Plant an immediate cover of grasses and legumes that      will hold everything together for a season or two.    </p>    <p>      [5] Plant a permanent cover of native shrubs, trees, vines,      and grasses that will eventually stabilize the area,      perpetuate themselves, build up soil fertility, encourage      wildlife, and completely restore the land.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Check dams.</strong> The way to stabilize the gully      bottom and build it up again is with check dams. Please      don't be intimidated by the thought of building a dam.      You're not going to be competing with Grand Coulee or      Aswan. In fact, your check dams won't even hold any water.      They are merely obstructions that will slow the water down.      And the best of all possible obstructions (as we all know      from our various misadventures in life) is a big mess.      Basically that is what a check dam is: a big mess of brush      or perhaps straw packed into the bottom of the gully, with      a simple structure to hold it all in place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Why a check dam works.</strong> I think we all have      an intuitive sense of why a check dam works: A slow-moving      stream carries far less silt and does far less damage than      a raging torrent. But to understand how dramatically true      this is, you might want to consider a few hard-core      engineering facts. If you reduce the speed of the flow of      water by one-half, here (according to certain laws of      hydraulics) is what happens:    </p>		<p>The erosive or cutting capacity of the water is reduced    about four times. The quantity of silt that can be carried is    reduced about thirty-two times. The size of particle that can    be transported by pushing or rolling is reduced about    sixty-four times.</p>    <p>      As you can see, by slowing down the flow of water, you      reduce the amount of damage it can do, and you very      spectacularly reduce the amount of silt it can carry. If      there is lots of silt suspended in the water, once you slow      the water down, most of the silt will be dropped -      thus building up the bottom of the gully again.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The principles of check dam architecture.</strong>      There are many possible designs and materials for building      check dams, but whichever one you choose must adhere to      certain architectural principles of check dam construction.    </p>        <p>      <strong>HEAD-TO-TOE ALIGNMENT</strong> The most effective way of building      check dams is to build them in a series where the base of      the upper dam is on a level with the top of the lower dam.      This will eventually stabilize the whole gully bottom and      will create a series of steps or terraces.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SMALLNESS</strong> "The bigger they are, the harder      they fall" applies particularly to check dams. For most      gullies, the check dams should be no more than about two      feet high. Anything much higher than two feet will      necessitate anchors, deadmen, and other retaining-wall      features. Several small dams are far more effective and      easier to build than one or two big dams.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIGGING IT IN</strong> The dam must be dug into the      walls of the gully, not just laid genteelly up against      them. Unless the dams are dug far enough in, water will      sweep around them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NOTCHING</strong> A notch is a place where the      water can flow over the dam. This is essential. Without      one, the silt builds up behind the dam, the water flows on      top of the silt, and instead of being led through the      notch, it may start eating away at one of the slopes.      Eventually, it may make a new channel around the dam. I've      seen many erosion-control dams standing proudly and nobly      on dry land while gullies flowed merrily around them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>APRON</strong> Once the silt builds up behind the      dam, the water flows through the notch like a waterfall.      You'll need an apron to catch it befores it digs out a pool      and undermines the dam. The easiest apron is a bed of      stones where the water can simply knock itself out and flow      tamely to the next check dam.    </p>		      <p>      <strong>Building a check dam.</strong> There are several      possibilities for building very good check dams: a rock      dam, a wire dam, a stake dam, a pole dam, and a plank or      slab dam. Which one you choose to build will probably      depend more upon the materials you can scrounge up than      upon anything else. I built mostly pole check dams because      we had plenty of poles. Whichever one you decide on,      remember to follow the general principles already laid out,      and you will make out very well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grading the slopes.</strong> After you build the      check dams, your next step is to break down the steep gully      walls to their <em>angle of repose</em> . To my ears,      "angle of repose" is one of the most beautiful phrases in      the language. Unfortunately, it's far easier to say it than      to do it. I know of no easy way of breaking down steep,      clifflike slopes. Professionals sometimes use dynamite and      bulldozers, so I've been told, but all the bulldozer      operators I've ever met are scared to death of working      along the rim of a sizable gully. When it comes to grading      gully slopes, the machine age has deserted you, my friend,      and what you are left with, wonder of wonders, is your      hands! So get together a collection of picks, mattocks,      shovels, and digging bars, round up everyone you know who      owes you a favor, and get on with it. Knock off the sharp      edges, and wherever you can, gentle out the steep slopes.    </p>    <p>      As you are working, you'll be knocking tons of earth down      into the gully bottom. The first rains will dissolve this      earth, spread it out, and deposit it behind the check dams      to raise the bottom. You can help this process along, and      also prepare the bottom for planting, by breaking up      whatever heavy clods fall into the bottom. If you have any      water, you might also wet the dirt down to compact it and      further ready it for planting.    </p>    <p>      Once the slopes have been graded to their angle of repose,      you should treat them for sheet erosion, with seed, mulch,      or the other devices recommended in the previous section.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Limiting the water flow.</strong> You now have to      make certain that as little water as possible enters the      gully. Where is the water coming from that originally      carved it out? You must find that water, even if it means      going out in the middle of a rainstorm.    </p>    <p>      You can usually restrict the flow by treating the area      above the gully head for sheet erosion. Contour trenches      usually work quite well, and as a last resort brush wattles      are nearly infallible. Whatever treatment you use, make      sure you extend it far up the slope.    </p>    <p>      Occasionally an expert will appear in your life and suggest      that you divert the flow of water away from the gully. He      will urge you to build a "diversion ditch," perhaps with an      "entrapment compound." He will probably pull out a pencil      and paper and make a few fancy diagrams. When you meet such      an expert, the first thing you should do is grimace, pound      your chest, jump up and down, and point excitedly to the      sky. If this doesn't scare him off, grab your hat and run.      As you can guess, my own experience with "diversion" has      been disastrous. Diversion does not solve any problem; it      just moves the problem somewhere else.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Planting.</strong> Once you've stabilized the      bottom of the gully, graded the slopes, and reduced the      flow of water, you have completed the mechanical aspects of      controlling the gully.    </p>    <p>      Now you should plant. Use the previously mentioned routine      of temporary planting followed by permanent planting. Don't      plant anything in the bottom until the silt has collected      into terraces. Then you can plant moisture-loving trees      right in the silt, where they'll usually thrive.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Maintenance.</strong> Remember the little Dutch boy      who put his finger in the dike, held back the ocean, and      became a culture hero to all five-year-olds? I don't      suggest you spend all next spring with your finger in a      check dam, but the Dutch-Boy Principle still holds: Small      leaks can be easily plugged. Sometimes all that is      necessary is for you to shove a few pine boughs in at the      right place. If you do, silt will continue to collect. If      you don't, the leak will often get bigger and bigger,      bringing the whole dam down. You should also check to see      that the mulch is still in place, the grass has germinated      well, and no heavy flow of water is entering the gully.      Visit your check dams as often as you can during the first      one or two seasons to see how well they are holding up and      to solve minor problems before they grow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Culverts.</strong> Culverts are pipes that bring      water under a road or trail. They are responsible for      thousands of gullies in every state. Road engineers have a      strange idea that if they install these culverts at a steep      pitch, the water will flow through them very fast and keep      the culverts clean of debris. Road engineers really get      turned on by "self-cleaning" or "self-maintaining"      culverts. But as I've already mentioned, the fast flow of      water increases its erosive powers many times over. And      often at the dump end of the culvert you will find a huge      gully.    </p>    <p>      If there is already a gully, you have no choice but to go      ahead with the gully trip. But if you can catch the problem      early, the best thing you can do is dump a lot of rocks,      broken asphalt, or cement rubble under where the culvert      lets out. This will break the force of the water, acting      much like an apron beneath a check dam. If you do this      wherever you have a culvert, you will save a lot of      aggravation and a lot of soil as well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Afterwards.</strong> I don't want to minimize the      fact that controlling a gully is hard work. But it is      necessary work, and in the long run extremely satisfying.    </p>    <p>      Once you have brought a gully under control, watch it      closely and uncritically. You may be in for a surprise.      Some of the most beautiful places I know are old,      stabilized gullies. When you are fighting a gully, you are      primarily fighting erosion damage. But you are also      creating a shady, potentially lovely, miniature canyon      which will collect. moisture, support many plants, and      become a wonderful refuge for wildlife. Turning a barren      gully into a lush pocket of life is the nearest a human      being can come to an oyster, which turns its injuries into      pearls.    </p>    <h3>      READING    </h3>    <p>      In other areas of conservation there is pitifully little      information. Not so with erosion control. The 1930s were      dust bowl years, gully years, and Civilian Conservation      Corps years. The CCC, the Forest Service, and the Soil      Conservation Service all published loads of erosion-control      pamphlets and books. Every field worker who developed a new      style of check dam - and there were hundreds -      published a description of it. Sometimes the check dams      collapsed within a few years, but the publications live on      to clog our minds. The problem I've had with      erosion-control literature is wading through it all for      what seems sound, relevant, trustworthy, and useful. Here      are some of the books I have found especially handy for      small-scale erosion-control projects.    </p>    <p>      <em>Handbook of Erosion Control in Mountain Meadows</em> ,      by Charles J. Kraebel and Arthur F. Pillsbury. California      Forest and Range Experimental Station: U.S. Forest Service,      1934.    </p>    <p>      For most people this is probably an impossible book to get      hold of, but by all means try your best. It's the most      thoroughly practical book I know, with lots of simple      suggestions for controlling gullies. There are excellent      diagrams and a strong emphasis on using native materials.    </p>    <p>      <em>A Study of Early Gully-Control Structures in the      Colorado Front Range</em> , by Burchard H. Heede Paper No.      55. Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station:      U.S. Forest Service, 1960.    </p>    <p>      This publication is a review of several Civilian      Conservation Corps structures, examined 25 years after they      were built. It shows which ones stood up, which ones      failed, how they failed, and why they failed. It's very      instructive. Here is your chance to learn from someone      else's mistakes.    </p>    <p>      <em>Grass in Soil Erosion Control</em> , by Layman Carrier.      SCS-TP-4. Washington, D.C.: Conservation Service, 1936.    </p>    <p>      This pamphlet gives a short list of various grasses and      discusses their erosion-fighting values.    </p>    <p>      <em>Results of and Recommendations for Seeding Grasses and      Legumes on TVA-CCC Erosion Control Projects</em> , by J.H.

Horton. California      Forest and Range Experiment Station: U.S. Forest Service,      1949.    </p>    <p>      Giving a plant-by-plant list of several species of trees      and bushes, this book tells where to plant them, when to      plant them, and even how to plant them. It also has      detailed diagrams of various erosion-control structures.      It's too bad this valuable book is so limited in      geographical area. You might check to see if your own      Forest and Range Experiment Station has a similar      publication.    </p>    <p>      <em>The Stream Conservation Handbook</em> , coed by      Nathanial P. Reed. New York: Crown Publishers, 1974.    </p>    <p>      This book claims that "the primary objective of stream      improvement is the restoration and enhancement of trout      habitat." It was written for fishermen, many of whom are      beginning to band together into groups like Trout Unlimited      to maintain their streams. The big-stream scale of this      book will probably make it not very handy for small      landholders. But if you do happen to have a fishing creek,      it will tell you what you have to know to keep it fishable.    </p>    <h3>      Cutting and Using Willow Stakes    </h3>    <p>      One of the first things the early settlers did when they      claimed a piece of land was to put up a fence. To make the      fence, they'd fell some relatively valueless tree, like a      willow, perhaps, and cut it into posts. After driving the      posts roughly into the ground with a maul, they'd set the      log rails on top of the posts, and there would be a crisp,      clean-looking fence for a couple of months at least.    </p>    <p>      Now if you've ever dealt much with fences, you know that      the major problem is usually decay. But if the fence is      made of willow posts, there is another very different sort      of problem. After a few months the fence posts begin to      sprout. Thick, turgid buds appear and spread up and down      the posts. The buds burst into leaf, and soon the fence      begins to grow - no longer a fence but a living,      vigorous row of willow trees.    </p>    <p>      Many river trees, like willows, cottonwoods, and poplars,      have this marvelous, persistent ability to sprout. It's an      important part of their survival, I suspect. Many of these      trees have long, whiplike or brittle branches that break      off in winter and float downstream. The heavier end      eventually settles somewhere in the wet mud and sends out      roots, and a new tree begins growing.    </p>    <p>      This remarkable rooting ability, which proved so      disconcerting to early fence builders, can be a great boon      to us. A willow branch pounded into the ground will grow      anywhere - yes, anywhere - as long as there is      enough year-round moisture. Willows will root in the most      barren and unstable of soils, which makes them the most      valuable tree I know of for erosion control.    </p>    <p>      Cottonwoods and poplars can also be rooted if you follow      the instructions I'm going to give. But in addition to      water they need a richer, "river bottom" type of soil if      they are to prosper.    </p>    <p>      <strong>When to plant.</strong> The best time to plant      willow cuttings is in the fall or very early spring -      when we call the tree dormant. Actually, only the leaves      are dormant. The roots continue to grow all winter from      stored energy, and when the buds burst in the spring, the      new leaves will have a healthy system of roots to provide      them with moisture and minerals.    </p>    <p>      There is a way of planting willows when they are in leaf.      The danger, of course, is that the leaves will transpire      moisture faster than the growing roots can provide it and      the tree will dry out. You can prevent this by clipping off      all the leaves along the stake except one or two, and by      continuing to trim off leaves all summer long. It's a lot      of trouble, and it's a bit risky, but if you can plant only      during the leafy season, you might give this method a try.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Collecting and preparing willow branches.</strong>      Follow normal instructions for pruning. Cut weak or crossed      branches first, and be sure to cut flush with the trunk . .      . don't leave a stub. Any willow will give equally good      cuttings, so don't get hung up on species.    </p>    <p>      After you collect the branches, cut them into convenient      lengths for planting. Don't try to chop them up while      you're in the middle of a tangle of willows, but drag the      branches out to a clear area where you can set up a      chopping block and have enough room to work.    </p>    <p>      The cuttings should be at least 18 inches long and at least      a half-inch thick. Anything this size or bigger -      even up to 10 or 12 feet long - will grow, but the      bigger the cutting, the deeper you will have to plant it,      so beware.    </p>    <p>      One thing that determines the length of the cuttings is the      water table. If you're planting on land that is wet      year-round, you can use shorter lengths. In our part of      California, where it gets dry in the summer, l usually have      to cut the stakes five feet long or more so that 1 can      pound them deep enough to reach moist soil.    </p>    <p>      To cut a branch, lay it over a chopping block and use a      sharp ax. At the thicker end (the end toward the trunk),      make a point. At the narrow end (toward the tip of the      branch), make a flat, straight cut.    </p>    <p>      It is very important to note which is the butt end. If you      plant the willow upside down, the sap will flow in the      wrong direction and the cutting will die.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Preparing a hole.</strong> If the ground is soft      and moist, you can just pound the stake into the ground      without any preparation.    </p>    <p>      If the ground is rocky, however, you might strip the bark      too badly by pounding, so you must first prepare a hole      - much the same idea as drilling a pilot hole for a      screw. For smaller stakes, you can pound a digging bar or      even a crowbar into the ground, wiggle it around a bit,      pull it out, and insert the cutting. For really big      cuttings, you may have to start the hole with a shovel or a      posthole digger (if you've got one), then use the digging      bar after you're a foot or so down.    </p>    <p>      The ground at the bottom of the hole should be moist, wet,      or even flooded. If you are planting in winter or spring,      remember that the water table is probably much higher than      it will be later in the year, so dig deeper than you think      is necessary.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pounding the cutting in.</strong> This step is a      mind-boggier. l would definitely recommend it as therapy to      those "nature lovers" who tippy-toe across lawns, who      cannot bear to see a tree pruned, and who otherwise insist      that plants are very fragile, delicate pieces of creation.      You take your carefully shaped cutting, insert its pointed      end into your carefully made hole, and just pound the hell      out of it. A heavy wooden mallet is the best tool. Or have      someone hold a piece of wood on the flat head of the stake      while you pound away with a sledgehammer. The idea is to      knock the stake deeply into the ground without splitting      the top too much. Split stakes grow, but they tend to dry      fast, rot, or (if they live very long) develop badly.    </p>    <p>      The cutting should have at least half its length under      ground, and even two-thirds or more of its length can be      buried. If you don't plant it deep enough, there will be      too much leaf and too little root.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Browsing.</strong> Cattle are notorious for      browsing young willows. They'll desert a pile of hay, a bed      of straw, the shade of an oak tree, or a field of alfalfa      and come running whenever they see a young willow. If there      are cattle present, you'll have to fence off the planting.    </p>    <p>      Wildlife browsing should not be too severe, unless you      happen to have an overabundance of hungry deer at the end      of a long, hard winter. If this is the case, you'd be best      off planting bigger, taller, thicker cuttings, which are      less tasty and which can withstand browsing somewhat      better.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Have faith.</strong> The first time I planted      willows, I felt unutterably depressed. After a full, hard      day's work, I stood there with a group of kids looking at      what we had done. It was a weird, desolate scene.      Everywhere around us we saw dead-looking sticks pounded      into the ground. It reminded me of an empty drive-in      theater, or a municipal parking lot with hundreds of      parking meters all over the place. We were all very tired,      cold, and discouraged. The kids kept asking me if I thought      these stakes would grow, and I said, "Of course" -      but only because that was what I was expected to say.    </p>    <p>      Later that spring the kids returned to the area to camp.      What they saw, as they told me later, was so exciting that      they couldn't fall asleep that night. The "parking meters"      were covered with thick, juicy buds just beginning to burst      into leaf.    </p>    <p>      Since then I've found willow cutting to be one of the      easiest, surest, and most rewarding of all projects.    </p>    <hr />   <p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: This article is an excerpt from    Malcolm Margolin's book,</em> The Earth Manual: How to Work    with Nature to Preserve, Restore, and Enjoy Wild Land Without    Taming It <em>(copyright © 1975, 1985 by Malcolm    Margolin).
