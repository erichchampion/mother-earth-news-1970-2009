           	 <p><strong>Ease the workload on      your farmstead with. . .</strong><br />		</p>				<h5 id="byline">    By Jean Petersen			</h5>        <p>      Most farmfolks will agree that unloading manure and compost      with a hand shovel is just about the most      <em>unpleasant</em> task imaginable. My husband Fred and I      thought so, too . . . and - thanks to our homemade      "pooper mover" - we now let the tractor take care of      such tiring (and messy) chores.    </p>    <p>      The "mover" comes in quite handy for a number of other jobs      around our Florida homestead, too. We frequently use our      invention to dump manure on the garden, to drag water      hyacinth from the Withlacoochee River, and to move heavy      logs over short distances.    </p>    <p>      If you have a tractor - and a little bit of know-how      - you ought to be able to build and use the same      gadget . . . or modify our design to fit your own specific      needs. (With a lot of scrounging, we were able to assemble      our device for only $12! If you're handy at "hardware      foraging", you can probably keep your expenses as low as      - or maybe even lower than - ours were.)    </p>    <h3>FILLING A NEED</h3>    <p>      The "pooper mover" was born of the desire to use an old '56      Ford 8N tractor to scrape manure out of our truck, over its      lowered tailgate, and onto the ground. And although our      standard boom crane was too short to handle the task, my      husband decided that the apparatus could be modified so it      <em>would</em> work.    </p>    <p>      (For the information of any folks who might be unfamiliar      with tractors . . . a boom crane consists basically of one      or more hooks fastened to a steel framework which, in turn,      fits onto the tractor's three-point hitch. The attachment      is used to lift machinery, bales, and so forth. Since such      implements can be bought new for around $80, chances are      that - if you don't already have one - you'll      be able to purchase a used unit at a fairly reasonable      price.)    </p>		    <p>      When Fred set out to "fix" our crane, he knew the boom      would have to be made longer. And the means to this end      turned out to be right in our own junkyard . . . in the      form of a street-lamp "extension arm" (the curved stem that      holds the light away from the lamppost). Of course, any      piece of curved pipe (approximately 1-1/2" in diameter and      72" long) would have done the job just as well.    </p>    <p>      Since we still wanted to be able to use our boom for other      tasks, too, we decided to bolt (rather than weld) the      extension arm in place. To do this, Fred first clamped the      lamppost arm under the crane's tip, with an overlap of      about 12 inches. Then - using a 9/16" bit - he      drilled two holes . . . spaced 7 inches apart and centered      so each bore was 2-1/2 inches from the nearest end of the      overlap (as in Photo 1) .    </p>    <p>      We fastened the tubes together with a pair of 5-1/2" X 1/2"      <em>hardened</em> steel bolts (be sure to ask for such      fasteners specifically . . . "regular" bolts won't be able      to withstand the stress placed on the joint by heavy      lifting or dragging).    </p>    <h3>A STEEL SCOOP</h3>    <p>      With the "new" longer arm in place, we needed a piece of      metal to serve as our scoop. The local salvage yard owner      recommended that we use hardened steel for this purpose,      too, and sold us a piece of 1/4" plate measuring 18-1/2" X      26" . . , which would be small enough to fit into tight      places when in use.    </p>    <p>      Our street-lamp extension arm came equipped with two      brackets which we used to secure the steel plate in      position (see Photo 2) . The lower (double-ended) mounting      hardware was fastened to the scoop with a pair of 1-1/2" X      1/2" bolts and lock washers . . . while a 1" spacer (simply      a piece of pipe cut to length) was used between the upper      bracket and the steel plate. A 3-1/2" X 1/2" bolt holds      this "top" assembly together, as shown in the accompanying      diagram. (If you fashion your extender from a length of      conduit, all you'll have to do is attach two similar      brackets to the pipe.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, we welded an "eye" onto the lower mounting point,      to accommodate the hook of a tow chain which was secured      - at its far end - to the boom crane itself (as      shown in Photo 3). The chain adds strength to the whole      assembly, since it effectively prevents the extension arm      from bending when the unloader is pulling.    </p>    <p>      In practice, we have found that our homemade scraper leaves      about two inches of manure just behind the cab of the      truck, but it's easy enough to get rid of those      hard-to-reach remnants with a shovel. Fred manages to      maneuver the scoop around the truck bed's wheel wells by      judicious use of the tractor's steering. (A little steering      goes along way, since the working plate is 11-1/2 feet      behind the tractor.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, I've found it an easy matter to use the device      to turn compost - in less than 10 minutes - -by      simply pulling the decomposing material out of our big      three-sided bin and then pushing it back in again.    </p>				    <h3>SELF-RELIANCE = SELF-SATISFACTION</h3>    <p>      There you have it: a device that's simple to build and      operate, has no moving parts, and will help you create a      healthier garden . . . by making short work of your most      strenuous and time-consuming chores.    </p>    <p>      Who knows? Maybe you'll start with our design and modify it      to tackle the specific heavy labor around <em>your</em>      place. I hope so, because - if you do - you'll      experience the same satisfaction I get every time I use the      "pooper mover" . . . the joy that comes from knowing that      we got the job done by relying on ourselves and making do      with what we had.    </p>
