                <p>		   <strong>Folks from all over are asking about . .      .</strong>		 </p>		           <p>		About a year and a half ago this magazine published an      article, by Elsie M. Banks, about an unusual breed of      livestock: the American Beefalo . . . a 3/8 bison and 5/8      domestic cattle hybrid (see page 82 in MOTHER NO. 57).      Well, Ms. Banks's informative story created such a stir      that the folks at the American Beefalo Association have      been swamped with letters . . . from "practically every      state in the union, every province in Canada, various parts      of Mexico, and as far away as Spain and England".    </p>    <p>      So, in an attempt to get the word out to as many      "alternative cow" enthusiasts as possible, George E.      O'Connor - Executive Director of the ABA - has      provided the following answers to the most frequently asked      questions about the magnificent hybrid cattle.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <strong>Question:</strong> What are the main advantages of      raising Beefalo instead of "standard" livestock?    </p>    <p>      <strong>O'Connor:</strong> A Beefalo's 3/8-bison,      5/8-bovine parentage provides the hybrid with the most      favorable genetic traits of both the American bison and      domestic cattle. According to ranchers who raise them, the      prolific crossbreeds are hardier, are more economical (and      <em>less</em> care-intensive) to nurture, and produce meat      that's superior to that of the common cow.    </p>    <p>      To be more specific, bison-crossed livestock inherit the      foraging ability of their free-roaming ancestors, and thus      can feed <em>entirely</em> on available hay and grasses . .      . efficiently converting pasturage to weight gain      <em>without</em> requiring extensive grain supplements. In      fact, tests by the ABA have shown that hybrids raised      solely on roughage rations actually <em>outgain</em> both      Beefalo <em>and</em> domestic cattle that have been fed on      grain. This distinctive Beefalo trait can add up to a      saving of about 10 cents for every pound the beasts put on!    </p>    <p>      In addition, the rugged critters are able to withstand      extreme cold (thanks to their thick "buffalo robes") ...      yet - like their native American forebears -      Beefalo perspire through the skin and thus maintain a      constant "cool", even during the sultry summer months.    </p>    <p>      The hybrids are also valued for their high degree of      fertility (they mature younger <em>and</em> breed earlier      than do standard cattle) <em>and</em> their lack of      reproductive problems. Beefalo calves are born easily      - and usually without any assistance -      requiring no special "infant" care from the homesteader.      The rugged young "percentage-bison" are smaller (tipping      the scales at 40 to 60 pounds at birth) than newborn      domestics, a characteristic that lessens the birthing      hazard to the Beefalo mamas . . . and the foraging "babies"      rapidly gain weight, generally reaching 800 to 900 pounds      in 10 to 12 months! Furthermore, the animals live longer      than do most standard cattle . . . and Beefalo bossies have      a longer productive life.    </p>    <p>      Finally, Beefalo meat is tender, more flavorful (and a      little sweeter), and - believe it or not - more      <em>nutritious</em> than the table fare from a common      steer. The "Beefalo brand" has 4 to 6% more protein and      only a fraction of the cholesterol of supermarket steak . .      . and less fat means less waste, less shrinkage,      <em>and</em> less time in the oven (which - in turn      - produces a household energy saving!). Any way you      look at it, it's a better "beef" buy! <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:      For a detailed, nutrient-by-nutrient comparison of Beefalo      vs. beef, see MOTHER NO. 57, page 83 . . . or write the      American Beefalo Association at the address given      below.]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Question:</strong> We're interested in building up      a Beefalo herd. How do we get started, and does the ABA      have a list of available breeders . . . or of farmers who      sell stock?    </p>    <p>      <strong>O'Connor:</strong> Ranchers already owning domestic      cattle can obtain semen from fullblood Beefalo bulls and      artificially breed their standard stock to produce a      halfblood (or 19% bison) Beefalo. Then, by breeding the      hybrid females <em>back</em> to fullblood bulls for two or      more subsequent generations, <em>pure</em> blood Beefalo      (approximately 38% bison) can be obtained. And, for those      farmers who are not set up to artificially inseminate their      cows, the ABA keeps a record of registered "percentage"      bulls that are available for breeding to domestic cows.    </p>    <p>      In addition, folks who are not yet in the cattle business,      or those Beefalo enthusiasts who would like to get a      quicker jump on the upbreeding process, may want to      <em>buy</em> percentage Beefalo stock. The ABA does not      give out the names of breeder members who have excess      cattle to sell, but if you write a letter of inquiry to the      organization, we will have breeder-members in your area      contact you.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Question:</strong> What is the average purchasing      price of Beef alo calves?    </p>    <p>      <strong>O'Connor:</strong> The hybrid stock are generally      sold at weaning age (when they're about 205 days old) . . .      at which time the cost for a half-blood Beefalo heifer is      around $1.00 per pound, or $500 to $600 per head. (Cattle      closer to purebred are usually a little more expensive.)    </p>    <p>      The purchasing price for <em>older</em> animals is      determined each year by the Kentucky National Beefalo Sale.      Recent market figures ranged from $1,150 to $4,000 a head      ... depending, of course, on the age of the beast and the      percentage of Beefalo in its blood.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Question:</strong> Does the ABA have a purebred      association in which Beefalo can be registered?    </p>    <p>      <strong>O'Connor:</strong> Yes, the American Beefalo      Association is an active, growing organization that      registered over 10,000 "percentage" Beefalo cattle in its      first five years of recording. Not only does the ABA      <em>register</em> purebred Beefalo stock, but it also has      an Ancestry Record that lists the breeding of      <em>other</em> part-bison livestock.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Question:</strong> Are Beefalo suitable for      commercial milking?    </p>    <p>      <strong>O'Connor:</strong> The hybrid bossies are usually      extremely good milkers (when crossed with dairy stock),      producing yields with a high butterfat content (their      production is partially dependent upon the milking record      of the domestic ancestor). One ABA member found that his      crossbreed cow gave 40 pounds of milk per day, with an      admirable butterfat content of 6.5% . . . while his      purebred Jerseys averaged 5.5 to 6.0% butterfat. And the      taste test? The bison ancestry Imparts a slightly      sweeter-than-usual flavor to the rich, creamy drink.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Question:</strong> Where can Beefalo meat be      purchased?    </p>    <p>      <strong>O'Connor:</strong> Currently, the demand for the      "buffalo beef" far exceeds the supply. Those people who are      fortunate enough to live near a breeder can sign up -      through the ABA - for the Breeder Home Freezer Sales      program.    </p>    <p>      The outlook for future Beefalo supplies, though, seems      overwhelmingly optimistic. More and more folks are becoming      aware of the distinct advantages of the hardy and      free-foraging gentle giants. The small amount of labor and      cost required to raise the critters make them perfect stock      for ranches of any size . . . while the superior quality of      the beef and milk - as well as the high sale price      that surplus cattle can demand - makes the hybrid      ideal for a land-limited homestead. In short, i!t appears      that the American Beefalo is here to stay .. . and will      soon be available to farmer and supermarket consumer alike.    </p><hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: An in-depth information packet on Beefalo      can be obtained from the American Beefalo Association,      Inc., Dept.
