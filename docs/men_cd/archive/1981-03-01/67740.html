                <p>      <em>While most people living in conventional dwellings are      hard pressed to cut their energy costs without spending a      small fortune doing it, these North Carolina folks have a      down-to-earth solution: They...</em>    </p>            <p>      Nearly a decade ago-when the general public had yet      to be convinced that earth-sheltered dwellings could be      sound investments-about the only people who bothered      with underground structures were either progressive      architects who often had to "overdo" their designs (and      hence raise construction costs) in order to suit the tastes      of their usually affluent clients, or truly versatile folk      who [a] more than likely couldn't <em>afford</em> a      contractor, let alone an architect, but who [b] likewise      realized the advantages of subterranean living, and so went      ahead and built their <em>own</em> shelters on a "learn      asyou go" basis.    </p>    <p>      These days, however, earthcovered residences are becoming      more popular ... and it's not unusual for the informed      "average citizen" to consider building an underground      abode.    </p>    <p>      One such person is Lloyd Remington, a professor of      chemistry at the University of North Carolina's Asheville      campus. Dr. Remington began building the home in the      accompanying photos (he calls it "The Hobbitat") back in      October of 1977, and moved in during May of the following      year. Admittedly, the house was never intended to be either      a public showplace or a demonstration of the latest in      gadgetry, but the doctor feels that he has accomplished his      goals: He built a pragmatically <em>un</em> conventional      home which could nonetheless boast such traditional      features as affordability, security, and soundness.    </p>    <h3>A SUCCESSFUL "EXPERIMENT" . . .</h3>    <p>      Dr. Remington knew all the time what sort of "return" he      wanted to realize from the time and resources invested in      his project, and felt that "going underground" was the      simplest and least expensive way to achieve his aims. Put      directly, he figured it would be sheer insanity to lay out      money to <em>build</em> a home, only to <em>continue</em>      spending substantial sums- year after year-to      maintain the structure and its interior comfort level.    </p>    <p>      All told, the professor based his decision to "dig" on four      factors:    </p>    <p>      [1] The earth provides a stabilized energy "sink" to help      buffer the extremes of seasonal climate.    </p>    <p>      [2] An "in-ground" dwelling affords the ultimate protection      from what might be the least recognized variety of thermal      "drain" in existence ... the wind chill factor. (This      element affects <em>buildings</em> as well as people and is      a basic part of the heat flow principle within any      structure.)    </p>    <p>      [3] Insurance premiums on an underground house are usually      lower than those for more orthodox residences, because      there's much less danger of damage to the structure from      fire, storms, vandals, or even fallen trees. In fact, the      underwriters of Lloyd Remington's policy gave the house a      "Triple A" rating ... a designation that's      shared-according to the doctor-by only one      other home in his area.    </p>    <p>      [4] An earth-covered structure can furnish adequate shelter      in the unlikely event of a nuclear crisis. Even though      Professor Remington (who taught a survival course as part      of the Civil Defense program years ago) points out that his      home wasn't primarily <em>designed</em> as a fallout      shelter, he and his family could "make do" in it if      necessary ... and will always enjoy the "bonus" thermal      protection provided by the building, while remaining secure      in the knowledge that they are relatively safe from any      intentional or accidental dispersion of radiation .    </p>    <h3>... AT A CONVENTIONAL PRICE</h3>    <p>      Since Dr. Remington planned to keep his overall costs as      low as possible, he essentially acted as his own contractor      ... which, practically speaking, meant that he chose (and      later paid) his own subcontractors, and coordinated their      work Sched ules. He also retained the services of a local      architect, who provided the engineering and design skills      necessary to assure that the final product was safe and      aesthetically pleasing.    </p>    <p>      Then, when much of the "homework" was done, he approached      the community's financial institutions-armed with      realistic figures and professional blueprints-and was      immediately successful in obtaining the promise of funds:      "I didn't run into <em>any</em> banks that weren't      interested ... in fact, some were very partial to the      project, <em>and</em> willing to bend a few rules in order      to see it completed."    </p>    <p>      And Lloyd Remington feels he got <em>more</em> than his      money's worth when it came to the job performed by his      building contractor. That individual <em>and</em> his crew      were enthusiastic about the venture they were involved in,      and put in a lot of <em>extra</em> time to see that the job      was done correctly.    </p>    <p>      The bottom line-as close as the professor can      estimate it-on the two-bedroom, 1,927-square-foot      house came to a bit over $80,000, or about $43 a square      foot ... a high figure for the western North Carolina area,      but not out of line in many other parts of the country,      especially when one realizes that the structure is      essentially "overbuilt" throughout.    </p>    <h3>A LIVE-IN THERMOS BOTTLE</h3>    <p>      For the most part, the Remington home was constructed along      lines common to <em>many</em> subsurface dwellings, but it      has some interesting variations. The building site sloped      toward the southwest, so the designer took advantage of the      natural lay of the land and positioned the structure to      face due south ... eliminating the need for backfill      berming except for that done on the west end of the      dwelling. Then the main excavation was made to a maximum      depth of 15 feet, and the driveway was graded to meet that      level.    </p>    <p>      Rather than pour the foundation and footing as one, the      builders chose to go with a "floating slab" design, in      which the walls are supported on a stout perimetrical      footing ... and the foundation itself rests <em>within</em>      , on top of a layer of gravelover-polyethylene.    </p>    <p>      The 2' X 4' footing holds up block walls with filled,      reinforced cores (except for those in the non-load-bearing      rear wall, which have alternating poured and      vermiculite-packed centers), and the roof panels are      prestressed concrete ... laid east-to-west, half-lapped      1/4" and caulked at their lateral joints, and covered with      a poured, 2 to 6" graded slab which is tied into the walls      by means of 3/4" reinforcing bar all around. (All told,      there are over 200 tons of concrete in the structure!)    </p>    <p>      In order to guarantee a comfortable, moisture-free      environment, Dr. Remington virtually enshrouded his house      in a combination of rubber, styrofoam, and a locally made      foundation drainage material. First, the completed walls      and roof were covered with a 1/10"-thick layer of      cured-in-place butyl rubber waterproofing. Next, panels of      2" and 3" styrofoam insulation were fastened to the      structure's sides and top, respectively. Then a seepage pad      (Enka. drain, made by the American Enka Company, Dept.      TMEN, Enka, North Carolina 28728) was placed over all of      the insulation board and the drainpipe which rests against      the exterior face of the footing. Finally, the entire      structure-and its insulated "raincoat"-was      covered with earth, to a depth of 30" in the front and 48"      at the rear.    </p>    <h3>PARTIALLY SOLAR-HEATED AND EARTH-COOLED,      TOO</h3>    <p>      Because the Asheville area isn't known for its temperature      extremes, Professor Remington chose an air-to-air heat pump      to function as the backup system in his all-electric      dwelling ... partially because such a unit can be      inexpensive to operate <em>if</em> used intelligently, but      mainly because it included an ideal forced-air handling      network that allows the distribution of <em>naturally</em>      tempered currents.    </p>    <p>      The Tar Heel Stater, you see, has incorporated a <em>solar      attic</em> into the upper part of his home's south-facing      wall and entranceway. Originally, the plan called for the      installation of 18 parabolic collectors to provide space      heating and domestic hot water... but such "luxury" wasn't      within the final budget. Instead, Remington covered the      exposed side of the attic with corrugated Filon glazing,      framed out its lower surface with 1 X 6 "ribs" which      support flat sheets of Kalwall, then tied the huge "hotbox"      into his air handling system, using a thermostatically      controlled fan. Not only does the massive collector provide      a fair amount of heat-usually enough to supply the      entire home during the daylight hours after 10:00 a.m. or      so on a winter day-but it's also the source of plenty      of more-than-welcome light for the living area below. (The      professor soon plans to set up one or two solar panels in      the enclosure to furnish hot water.)    </p>    <p>      Additionally, to supplement the other two heat sources, the      Remington family uses a combination wood-and-coal stove...      usually only when the outside temperature dips below      20°F, which is beyond the heat pump's operational range      of efficiency. Furthermore, a manually controlled damper,      built into the bottom of the air distribution duct and      located at the top of a "channeling" shaft just above the      woodburner, allows normally stagnant ceiling warmth to      collect-for later use-in the insulated air      supply chamber.    </p>    <p>      During the warmer months, the Remingtons usually enjoy a      comfortable environment simply because they're essentially      living "in the earth" ... but, should tem peratures within      the home creep upward, a louvered fan installed at each end      of the solar attic can "sweep" that area clean of heat (the      blowers can also be left <em>closed</em> , and just the air      delivery system of the heat pump activated, with the house      windows open ... an alternative that has proved to be      reasonably cost-effective). But if the ambient air is      uncomfortably warm, the Remingtons also have the option of      utilizing an earth-cooled air duct (merely a 20-foot length      of 18"-diameter culvert pipe buried in the soil), which      feeds into the home's ventilation system to provide sup.      plementarycooling.    </p>    <h3>WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT</h3>    <p>      Admittedly, it would be pretty hard for many folks to      justify spending the amount of money that the Remingtons      did ... especially if the people had their sights set on a      similar-sized <em>conventional</em> dwelling, which might      cost onehalf to two-thirds as much. But when you consider      the energy savings to be had, it appears that the professor      made a good investment. He has kept accurate temperature      and utility bill records for most of the house's history,      and calculates the minimum <em>total</em> power usage to be      below 1,000 KWH per month, and the maximum 2,300 KWH. The      average consumption for any "heated" or "cooled" month      figured out to about 1,500 KWH, and the <em>most</em> spent      on conventional heating alone was about $38 for a 30-day      period. Remington's <em>total</em> heating costs for the      first winter-for electricity, wood, and coalcame to      ascent $180.    </p>    <p>      Thus the monthly savings-added to the reduced price of      maintenance and insurancecould make the long-term ownership      of such a subterranean dwelling quite attractive. If      <em>you're</em> considering the construction of an      earthsheltered home, there probably isn't a better time to      "get ,with it" than right now!    </p>
