                <p>      <strong>When the fine spring weather awakens your      hibernating sense of adventure, make this miniature aerial      explorer and watch as it takes flight.</strong>    </p>          <h5 id="byline">By Fred Ohlerking</h5>      <p>      Just about everybody feels the urge to "take off" once the      weather warms up . . . and, even if springtime chores are      keeping you tied to the homestead or back yard, you can      <strong>still</strong> make an escape (although only for a      little vicarious adventure). Using just a few household      materials, you can put together the simple airship      illustrated here, launch it on free "fuel", and watch your      spirits take flight!    </p>    <p>      To construct your own miniature dirigible, you'll need      seven sheets of 20" X 30" tissue paper, a six-foot length      of 14-gauge wire for a couple of scavenged coat hangers),      some white glue, a pair of scissors, and a roll of Scotch      tape.    </p>        <h3>A LOT OF HOT AIR</h3>    <p>      Once you've put the simple flyer together, you'll need to      create a source of heat to send it aloft . . . and that,      too, is a quick-and-easy process. Collect six      <em>large</em> juice cans (the 46-ounce size works fine)      and cut out both ends from five of them. The sixth can will      serve as the base of the "smokestack", so you should remove      only its top. You should also cut a wedge-shaped opening In      one side of that "bottom" can, as illustrated. (You can      start the hole with a triangle can opener, then use a pair      of tinsnips to enlarge it . . . and bend the sharp edges      inward with pliers.)    </p>    <p>      Next, make three small holes (evenly spaced) around the top      and bottom of each can, and thread short lengths of wire      through those openings to fasten the cylinders together in      a vertical stack. Finally - to prevent cinders from      flying up into the balloon - wire a section of screen      on top of the burner.    </p>        <h3>      UP! UP! AND AWAY!    </h3>    <p>      When you're ready to launch the balloon, grab a couple of      friends or curious youngsters and a generous supply of old      newspapers . . . and head for the nearest open area that's      free of trees, utility wires, rooftops, and winds over 5      MPH. (A large field or a big parking lot should do.)    </p>    <p>      Using crumpled newspaper, build a slow fire in the bottom      of the burner while two people hold the balloon over the      top of the stack. When the tissue walls begin to feel warm      and the ship starts lifting, let it go . . . and watch your      homemade balloon float lazily skyward! The craft will      probably soar to 200 feet or more, and then in a few      minutes (the duration of the flight will depend on the      outside air temperature) it'll begin to descend. Chase the      "ship" down, and it's ready to launch again.    </p>    <p>      Although this simple hot air balloon is practically      fail-safe, there's always a slight danger that the craft      will catch fire. If the tissue does burst into flame while      the hot air is filling it, <em>don't try to put out the      blaze</em> . . . remember that the toy cost only about      50 cents to make! Simply let it float upward to be quickly      consumed by the flames.    </p>    <p>      After all, you can easily build a replacement in no time.      In fact, "backyard" hot air ballooning is one of the      <em>quickest</em> - and least expensive - cures      for spring fever that I know!    </p>
