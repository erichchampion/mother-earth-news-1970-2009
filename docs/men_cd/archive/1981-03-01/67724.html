                <p>      <em>In 1980, MOTHER's gardens hosted 25 eager apprentices.      And now, for the 1981 season, we are extending an open      invitation to all of our readers to...</em>    </p>           <p>      If you have already read about Alan Chadwick and his      important contributions to horticulture (see the tribute on      page 70 in MOTHER NO. 66), you'll be glad to know that      - although the man is gone - his world-renowned      wholistic gardening technique lives on!    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's staff is very pleased to announce another series      of workshops based - i n part - upon Chadwick's      methods of biodynamic/French intensive gardening . . .      which will be held this spring, summer, and fall (April      20-29, May 4-13, June 1-10, August 31-September 9, and      September 28-October 7) on our beautiful 622.4 acres of      mountain property in western North Carolina.    </p>    <p>      Master gardeners Kerry and Barbara Sullivan - both of      whom are former apprentices of Alan Chadwick and now      fulltime members of MOTHER's Eco-Village staff - will      guide workshop participants through a full ten days of      theory, technique, and actual practice in MOTHER's organic      gardens.    </p>    <p>      All those who attend will learn about preparation of raised      beds, sowing and transplanting, and needed maintenance such      as weeding and watering . . . <em>all</em> of which will      involve plenty of hands-on experience. Planned discussions      with Kerry and Barbara will include advice on compost,      seedlings, greenhouses, potting soils, cold frames, and      more!    </p>    <p>      The fee for each session will be $150, with camping      facilities (but not meals) provided for the participants.      Because of the intense treatment of the subject matter and      the long hours involved in getting hands-on experience in      the gardens (this is to be a <em>work</em> shop), Kerry and      Barbara have stipulated that no families or pets be brought      along for the sessions.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to obtain more information or register for      one of the workshops, write to Kerry and Barbara Sullivan,      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , P.0.    </p>    <p>      Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791 (please      include a self-addressed, stamped envelope). W e hope to      share our garden with you this year!    </p>
