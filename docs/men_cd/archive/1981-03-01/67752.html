                    <p>      <em>Here's an easy-to-build "rainy-day" home project that      can save you both money and energy ... in fact, your family      probably can't afford not to make one!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">By Lorena Hillis</h5>   <p>      One of the worst energy gobblers in any home-aside      from the dwelling's heating system and water      heater-is the clothes dryer. Not only are such      appliances power hungry, but they're also incredibly      wasteful: All the nice warm, humid air they produce is      usually blown <em>outside!</em>    </p>         <p>      In the summer, of course, it's easy to avoid the energy      waste by relying on solar power to "fuel" that old standby:      an outdoor clothesline, However, you may have wondered,      what can a person do on those all-too-frequent rainy spring      (or snowy winter) days when the weather refuses to      cooperate?    </p>    <p>      The answer may be an <em>indoor</em> clothesdrying rack,      similar to the one pictured here. My dad has been building      the devices for our family's use since 1949 ... and Mom      depended on the handy racks for 30 years <em>without</em>      the backup aid of an electric dryer. The "granddaddy" of      our present indoor clothes dryer was made of wood, but that      early model eventually fell apart ... after almost 12 years      of continuous use!    </p>    <p>      Dad was, I think, a tad disappointed that his original      design didn't hold up better, so he came up with an      allaluminum model that is sturdier, is relatively simple to      build, hangs over the top of any door in the house, and      stores easily. The homemade dryer is also a natural      energy-saver, since it uses no fuel other than the warmth      already circulating through the house (while allowing      humidity to transfer from the wet clothes to the often dry      indoor air). The sturdy frame can handle anything from      diapers to blankets ... and it'll usually dry a full load      of wash within 24 hours.    </p>    <h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3>    <p>      Basically, the portable clothes rack is nothing more than      four parallel bars riveted to two end pieces to form a      square frame ... plus three hanger units that secure the      contraption to the top of a door. Clothespins are then      attached-using nuts and bolts-at regular      intervals along the crossbars. To make your own      over-thedoor dryer, you'll need 22 feet of aluminum flat      bar (the best size is 1/8" X 3/4"), 42 one-inch-long bolts      and 84 nuts, 26 rivets, and 42 clothespins (I recommend      <em>wooden</em> pins with large springs, because I've found      that plastic fasteners-and those with small      springs-just don't last as long as do the      "old-fashioned" kind).    </p>    <p>      Before you can put your drying rack together, you'll have      to divide the aluminum into several different lengths.      First, cut four 33-1/2" pieces, and bend the      metal-using a vise-to a 90° angle ... at      points 2 inches from each end of every strap. These will      become the crossbars, frome which you'll hang the wet      clothes.    </p>    <p>      Next, cut two 29-1/2" lengths ( <em>don't</em> bend these      sections) to serve as the ends of the frame. To fashion the      hanger bars, cut three 12-1/4" pieces ... then-on one      end of <em>each</em> of them-form a 90° angle at      the 2-inch mark, and another at 3-1/2 inches. (If      necessary, you can modify these measurements to make the      rack fit the dimensions of the door you're planning to      use.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, you'll need two short supports, which will attach      the <em>end</em> hangers to the frame (as shown in the      diagram). Bend each 17"-long piece, at a point 1 inch from      one end, to an angle that will allow the support to be      riveted flat against its hanger. In addition, use your vise      to twist the metal, as illustrated, into a 90° "turn"      ... so that it'll rest flat against the horizontal      crossbar.    </p>    <p>      Drill holes for the clothespins at regular intervals along      the four crossbars <em>and</em> the end bar which will      <em>not</em> be attached to the hanger units. Make the      first hole in each section four inches from the bend in the      bar, to allow for clearance at the edge that'll be closest      to the door ... then make eight more holes spaced 3 inches      apart. Attach a clothespin at each opening-by running      a bolt through its spring, as shown in the diagram-on      the <em>inside</em> of the aluminum bar.    </p>    <p>      Next, drill the necessary holes and rivet the frame      together as illustrated. The rivets which secure the      hangers to the rack should be flush, to avoid scratching      the door ... but you might want to go ahead and drape a      towel over the top of the portal before the rack is hung      up, just in case. (You can provide further protection by      simply gluing strips of felt to the underside of each      hanger unit.)    </p>    <p>      That's really all there is to it: You can make one of the      racks in a couple of hours ... and use it for years!      Although the dryer <em>can</em> serve as a household's only      means of drying clothes, I like to combine the capabilities      of my over-the-door helper with those of a modern electric      dryer. First, I just tumble a load of wet clothes in the      dryer-on low heat-for five to ten minutes ...      then switch to air only for another ten minutes, in order      to use up any heat that may be left in the clothes, before      hanging the laundry. My system removes wrinkles      (eliminating the need for ironing) <em>and</em> saves      energy!    </p>
