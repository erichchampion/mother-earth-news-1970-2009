                <p>      <em>Move some of nature's most delicious edibles into your      yard and garden.</em>    </p>                        <h5 id="byline">     By Lew Nichols and E.A. Proulx</h5>     <p>      With rural land being gobbled up at a rapid rate, it's      increasingly difficult to forage many once-common wild      delicacies. However, we've found that grafting a few scions      from an old roadside apple tree to commercial rootstocks      can insure our household against the awful possibility,      some autumn, that our nearby wild apple source will be      bulldozed to make way for a new shopping mall. And our      transplanted <em>backyard</em> brambles eliminate long      expeditions to a favorite berry patch, many of which used      to end with the discovery that the local bears had beaten      us to the crop!    </p>    <h3>ADAPTABLE AND HARDY</h3>    <p>      Most wild fruits and berries will thrive in home gardens,      since such varieties are typically very hardy. In fact, in      our section of Vermont-where winter temperatures      often reach 30 below-many domestic species can't      survive ... but transplanted <em>native</em> berries and      fruits, born and bred to withstand the rigorous weather,      are strong and productive.    </p>    <p>      However, before you dash off and invite wild edibles into      <em>your</em> yard, heed a word of warning. We've been      lucky, so far, to find healthy stock in our remote area,      but wild plants sometimes <em>do</em> harbor diseases . . .      many of which can attack and <em>devastate</em> tender,      virus-free, commercial breeds.    </p>    <p>      So if you're already raising fancy hybrid raspberries or      blackberries, it would be wise to plant their wild cousins      as far from the "commercials" as your space allows ... to      prevent possible infection by leaf curl, orange rust, or      verticillium wilt (the most common ailments of wild      brambles). Also, keep all your foraged bushes away from      tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes, and apple and maple      trees . . . and <em>don't</em> place wild stock in soil      where those plants or trees have grown within the previous      two years, in case the former "residents" might have      harbored diseases that could damage your transplants.    </p>    <p>      There are three seasonal stages in taming wild fruits and      berries. First, as the fruit ripens (in its original      habitat), we mark the most productive and healthy plants or      trees with a stake or some bright ribbon tied to a branch      or cane. Then, later in the fall, we prepare the beds to      which the wild natives will be transplanted, working      organic matter into the soil, and correcting its pH balance      if necessary. And finally, the following spring, we go      forth with a shovel, burlap sacks, and anticipation... dig      up our prizes... and quickly place them in their new homes.    </p>    <h3>SUCCULENT STRAWBERRIES</h3>    <p>      The perennial wild strawberry (genus <em>Fragaria</em> ) is      among the most delicious of all fruits ( <em>sample</em>      the berries a season before transplanting, however, because      some wood strawberries- <em>Fragaria vescaare</em>      all but tasteless). The large, commercially grown hybrids      developed from native North American wildings have never      matched the delectable, aromatic, "strawberry" flavor of      most of their uncivilized ancestors.    </p>    <p>      Such plants are so vigorous, and transplant so well, that      it's difficult to make a mistake with them! Simply flll      your strawberry bed with well-tilled, slightly sandy,      compostenriched loam and adjust the pH range-if      necessary-to between 5.8 and 6.5. Remember, though,      that good air circulation and water drainage (the plants      can't tolerate standing water) are <em>more</em> important      than either pH levels or soil composition.    </p>    <p>      In the early spring, before the plants have flowered, scoop      up the previously selected, shallow-rooted strawberry      crowns with a trowel-keeping plenty of soil around      the roots to lessen the shock of transplanting-and      set them out, leaving 12 inches between plants and three      feet between rows. (Be careful <em>not</em> to cover the      crowns with earth.) Then, when the flowers appear, <em>pick      them off</em> for heavier fruit production the      <em>following</em> year. (Any runners that sprout after      August should also be snipped away.)    </p>    <p>      In order to meet their early ripening schedule, the plants      almost always put out blossoms before the last of spring's      treacherous weather is over. Therefore, here in the North,      they must be planted on a slope above low-ground frost      pockets if they're to give the highest possible yields.      Even so, if the thermometer takes a quixotic plunge, you      should cover the plants to protect their tender blossoms.    </p>    <p>      By late August, we have several rows of flourishing      dark-green plants, which promise us a good yield during the      summer to come. After the first few fall frosts, we mulch      the plants with straw or dry calamus or cattail leaves.      Then, come spring, the covering is removed and spread      <em>between</em> the rows, and-as we keep a careful      ear tuned to late frost reports-we start counting our      strawberryshortcakes.    </p>    <h3>VERSATILE ELDERBERRIES</h3>    <p>      One of the most <em>useful</em> woodland plants is the      elderberry ... the flowers and fruits of which can be used      to make superb wine, jelly, fritters, pies, muffins,      pancakes, chutney, and a deliciously refreshing      <em>non</em> alcoholic drink. In the Northeast, several      kinds of elderberries grow wild, but the common elderberry      ( <em>Sambucus canadensis</em> ) is the most familiar.    </p>    <p>      Each spring we dig up plants of a size we can handle and      pack the roots in moist mulch before we take them home. If      a bush is tall and rangy, we prune it back by half in the      field, and then plant it as we would a bare-rooted tree...      an inch deeper than it grew in the woods.    </p>    <p>      Fast-growing common elderberries enjoy damp habitats, and      tend to spread vigorously if not cut back. The best place      to transplant one is in a moist area near a compost heap,      for they're reported to help speed the fermentation of      compost and produce a fine humus soil around their roots.    </p>    <p>      The easy-to-care-for wildings are prey to very few insects      and diseases, but over 43 species of birds place      elderberries high on their list of delicacies, so be      prepared to share-or to use protective nets-as      the clustered treats ripen.    </p>    <h3>ZESTY WILD APPLES</h3>    <p>      Wild apples might be either neglected old cultivars found      in abandoned "tame" orchards, or seedling crabapples long      since descended from domestic trees. Since apple seeds      don't propagate true to type (it's been computed that only      one of 10,000 kernels will produce an outstanding eating      apple), the majority of wild trees revert to the      characteristics of their ancient crab-stock ancestors ...      producing small, tart fruits that make excellent pies,      jellies, and sauce ... and superior sweet ( <em>or</em>      hard) cider.    </p>    <p>      Naturally seeded trees growing in the wild can be dug up      and transplanted to develop into mature specimens, or can      be used as rootstock after a year of adjustment to their      new locale. For either purpose, the transplanting must be      done while the trees are dormant.    </p>    <p>      It's best to prepare roomy holes to receive the wild      seedlings, and replace any hardpan or poor earth with rich      topsoil. As soon as we dig up a wild tree, we immediately      wrap its roots in burlap or plastic and rush the sapling to      the already prepared planting site.    </p>    <p>      Once there, we snip off any shovel-frayed roots and spread      the rest out on the bottom layer of rich, well-worked      soil... positioning the tree about an inch deeper than it      grew in the wild. The earth is next built up around the      roots . . . then patted firm ... and the final layer of      dirt is tamped down, by foot, to make a two-inch-deep      water-holding depression all around the tree. After that,      each new transplant gets a bucket of water, which soaks the      earth and helps collapse any hidden air pockets.    </p>    <p>      Top-pruning is important, both to balance root loss and to      conserve the tree's vigor during its period of adjustment,      so slice off-flush with the trunk-any crossed,      dead, and obviously weak or badly angled branches ... prune      the remaining limbs ... and cut the top halfway back.      Finally, paint the pruning wounds with a special tree      sealer or nonleaded paint.    </p>    <p>      If the weather is dry, water the trees every few days, but      don't add any fertilizer during the first season: Strong      substances could injure trimmed and weak roots.    </p>    <p>      Don't try a graft on a freshly planted seedling, either ...      it would probably fail, so it's best to wait a year, until      the tree has recovered from transplantation shock. Once      established, however, wild apple seedlings-because      they're suited to your climate- <em>can</em> provide      especially hardy rootstock for your grafting experiments.      (All apples are related through the genus <em>Malus</em> ,      so all are graft-compatible.) Be sure, though-when      grafting-that the trees from which you choose scions      can also tolerate your region's weather. It's useless, for      example, to expect a warmth-loving Granny Smith scion to      survive a Vermont winter simply because it's been grafted      onto a northern New England rootstock.    </p>    <h3>DEALING WITH BRAMBLES</h3>    <p>      The fruiting canes of both raspberries and blackberries are      fast-growing biennial croppers, while their roots are      perennial. You'll notice, however, that the two "relatives"      are seldom found together in the same bramble thicket.      Raspberries can be a host of <em>anthracnose</em> , you      see, a blight which isn't fatal to the carrier, but which      might destroy nearby blackberries.    </p>    <p>      Both of these wild berry species should be dug up in the      spring, while still dormant. You ought to know, before you      set out, that sorting the <em>primocanes</em> (canes      produced during the previous season, which <em>will</em>      bear fruit during the coming summer) from the      <em>floricanes</em> (those that bore last season and will      soon be either dead or unproductive) takes a little time.      At first glance, they'll all look much the same,      but-on closer inspection-you'll discover that      the primocanes are smaller, and of a brighter color, than      are the floricanes. (It's best to simply tag the primocanes      during the late summer berry season, prior to your planned      spring digging.)    </p>    <h3>BLACK AND RED BEAUTIES</h3>    <p>      Blackberries are the most complex of the <em>Rubus</em>      genus, and some 122 species have been recorded. A few of      these have <em>small</em> protective "prickles" ... but the      most widely spread wild blackberry species in the Northeast      defends itself with fierce, stout thorns that can make      foraging something of a martyr's task. In the orderly rows      of a <em>transplanted</em> wild blackberry patch, however,      the harvest is much less hazardous.    </p>    <p>      Cut your planted blackberry canes back to the roots . . .      and allow about 30 inches between plants, and six to ten      feet between rows, to lessen the chance of fungus      contagion. Cultivate or use mulch to keep weeds down and      help the plants give higher yields.    </p>    <p>      Wild red raspberries can be substituted for blackberries in      almost any recipe and-when served fresh-can      turn an ordinary meal into a royal feast. It's tempting to      take the entire raspberry cane in the hope of a greater      fruit reward, but the roots-which will be injured and      smaller after transplanting-can't support the whole      cane (which would either become barren or die back). For      that reason, you should prune the canes to the first bud-or      to any bud that's no more than six inches above ground      level-and plant them an inch deeper than they grew in      the wild.    </p>    <p>      Raspberries need frequent waterings in dry weather, and a      hay or grass-clipping mulch to keep the soil moist and      weeds in check.    </p>    <p>      Of course, adventurous gardeners who are interested in      experimenting with wild fruit can choose from many other      undomesticated edibles: Wild cherries, serviceberries,      blueberries, and more will gladly leave their woodland      homes for your farmstead fields . . . all they'll ask in      return is a little care.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Needless to say, to-be-transplanted wild      fruits and berries should be dug</em> only <em>from your      own acre age or from the property of a landowner who has      granted you permission. Furthermore, certain wild plants      may be in danger of extinction in your area: Consult your      state chapter of the American. Federation of Garden Clubs      for information on local endangered species. Always be      careful not to disturb surrounding habitat while gathering      your transplants . . . and leave enough trees or      bushes</em> in the wild <em>to make cure that the grove or      patch you have "borrowed " from will survive.</em>    </p>
