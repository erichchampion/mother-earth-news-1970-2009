                    <p>      <em>This year, why not try a new twist on an old holiday      ritual.</em>    </p>            <h5 id="byline">By Lisa T. Peklo</h5>     <p>      With a little help from you, your children can undertake an      enjoyable task and learn a bit about the natural world at      the same time ... by planting <em>real</em> grass seed in      this year's Easter baskets! The project is inexpensive,      simple to accomplish ... and just plain fun!    </p>    <p>      In order to prepare their "living baskets", the youngsters      will merely have to line standard woven containers with any      one of the following materials: foil, plastic wrap,      sphagnum moss, or burlap. Then let them fill each basket      with fine-grained garden (or potting) soil ... sprinkle the      earth with an even covering of grass seed ... and moisten      it daily with a mist spray.    </p>    <p>      When the seeds have sprouted, set the baskets in a sunny      location (on a windowsill if frosts are common in your area      at this time of year), and be sure the children continue to      mist the turf regularly. Soon an authentic green "carpet"      of grass will form a lush nest for brightly colored Easter      eggs. And <em>after</em> the spring holiday, the little      circles of sod can be transplanted outdoors. Just find a      bare spot in your yard and lay the covering to rest.    </p>    <p>      In the course of preparing <em>these</em> Easter baskets,      your youngsters will be picking up knowledge about the way      things grow. You can bet that the lesson will stay with      them, too. After all, how can you beat "lawning by doing"!    </p>
