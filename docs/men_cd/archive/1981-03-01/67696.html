                <p>      <strong>Celebrate spring by brewing this spicy, traditional      Australian beverage:</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">    By Joan Y. Goddard    </h5>        <p>      Folks who prefer a self-sufficient lifestyle are      <em>always</em> looking for ways to "do it themselves" and      avoid expensive store-bought items . . . and that rule      applies to <em>Australian</em> back-to-the-landers as well      as to those of us in North America! In fact, when I lived      "down under" for a time, I learned the secrets of making      delicious ginger beer from a neighbor who used to share the      fruits of such efforts on warm afternoons.    </p>    <p>      I was quite impressed by his method of beermaking: the      superior quality of ingredients used . . . the loving care      he lavished on the starter (or "plant", as it's usually      called by Aussies) . . . and the surprising ease of the      beverage's preparation. The hazy, pungent drink -      which has only a <em>small</em> alcohol content - is      also an effective thirst quencher, so I made sure to      memorize my friend's techniques before I left the southern      continent.    </p>    <p>      Ginger beer - as it's made down under - has its      simple beginnings in the plant . . . which combines Sultana      (or golden) raisins, fresh lemons, raw sugar, spring water,      and freshly ground ginger. (The spice is available in most      any food store, or you may, if you live in the eastern      portions of the U.S. or Canada, be able to forage for wild      ginger - <em>Asarum cana</em> <em>dense</em> -      on your own acres. Just dig up the long horizontal roots,      which lie right below the surface, and chop them fine.) The      starter for ginger beer is allowed to ferment for a week      before the brewing process can begin. And - as is      done in the American method of making sourdough - a      portion of that plant is always set aside to initiate      future batches.    </p>    <h3>START THE STARTER</h3>    <p>      In a quart jar, stir together 8 raisins (in a pinch, you      can always substitute darker varieties for the golden      Sultanas I've specified), the juice of 2 lemons, 1 teaspoon      of grated lemon rind or pulp, 4 teaspoons of raw sugar (I      prefer to use turbinado), 2 teaspoons of ground ginger      root, and 2 cups of spring water. Allow the mixture to      stand in a warm place - where the temperature will      stay between 70 and 80Â°F - for two or three days,      until it starts to ferment. (The process may take a bit      longer in cool weather.)    </p>    <p>      After the plant has begun to "work", you'll need to feed it      once a day, for a week, with a mixture of 2 teaspoons of      ground ginger and 4 teaspoons of turbinado sugar. At the      end of seven days, the starter will be ready for use in the      brew.    </p>    <p>      To make a batch of ginger beer, you'll need a large mixing      bowl (or a blue enamel canner) and one case of clean,      sterilized beer - or soda - bottles. Pour 4      cups of boiling water over 4 cups of sugar, and stir the      mix until the granules are dissolved. Then add 3 quarts of      cold spring water, the juice of 4 lemons, and the starter.      Strain the resulting liquid through a muslin square placed      in the bottom of a colander . . . then squeeze the cloth      dry, into a separate container, and save the "salvaged"      moisture to begin the "plant" for your next batch of ginger      beer.    </p>    <h3>BOTTLE AND BREW</h3>    <p>      Stir the strained lager well, and fill each bottle to      within an inch of its top. (This recipe should produce      enough to fill 20 to 24 bottles.) Then cap each container      tightly with a metal top . . . using a beer bottle capper      (which you should be able to buy for under $15 at a good      hardware or homebrew supply store). Because of the      "explosive" nature of the stored liquid, it's essential      that you use <em>returnable</em> bottles . . . not the      thinner disposable containers (which simply can't stand up      to the pressure).    </p>    <p>      After three days at room temperature, the Australian brew      will be ready to be cooled and consumed. However, if you      don't drink it all right away, be sure to store your ginger      beer in a refrigerator or root cellar where it will remain      cool. I once tried stashing my hoard in the basement during      a spell of hot weather . . . and was rudely awakened in the      middle of the night by the sound of exploding bottles! I've      also learned - from experience - to open each      bottle inside a wide-mouthed pitcher, just in case that      particular "vintage" is especially bubbly.    </p>    <p>      In addition, don't forget to care for the leftover plant,      so you can use it to start your <em>next</em> batch of the      effervescent potable. Just pour it into a clean quart jar      and add 2 cups of spring water, 2 teaspoons of ground      ginger, and 4 teaspoons of raw sugar. Then lovingly watch      over the mixture-and feed it with the same daily dosage you      gave the original starteruntil you're ready to concoct      another round of ginger beer. The plant will "die" after      about a week, though . . . so you'll need to use it for a      new batch within seven days, or throw out the spent starter      and begin all over again.    </p>    <p>      Because of differences in weather, bottling conditions, and      ingredients, you'll find that no two batches of the      Australian beer turn out exactly alike . . . but that's      part of the fun of making it yourself. At any rate, my      guess is that - once you've produced your      <em>first</em> bottles of the spicy, tingling drink -      you'll often gather with friends to share a glass of this      delightful brew, and exchange a rousing "Good on ya, mate"!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Ginger beer is only one of dozens of      unusual beverages you can brew in, your own kitchen, using      natural ingredients.
