                <p>      <strong>In MOTHER EARTH NO. 67, we showed you how to      incorporate your extra sprouts into <em>every</em> course      of a sample winter meal. Well, <em>spring</em> greens are      just as versatile, as these recipes demonstrate.</strong>    </p>    		        <p>      In most parts of North America, gardeners aren't harvesting      bumper crops of edibles just yet . . . but many folks      <em>do</em> have an abundant supply of early greens already      popping up. And that, of course, leads to the age-old      gardener's problem of what to <em>do</em> with the extra      harvest.    </p>    <p>      Well, if <em>you're</em> in such a situation and are tired      of simply boiling up the leafy vegetables, try using them      in a <em>variety</em> of dishes: You may be surprised to      find that the nutritious potherbs will blend well in      salads, casseroles . . . and even desserts! As an example,      we've put together a light, satisfying meal which features      several recipes using spinach (one of the most popular      early vegetables) . . . but you can very easily substitute      mustard, beet, or whatever <em>other</em> spring greens      your garden might be producing now.    </p>    <h3>SPINACH SALAD</h3>    <p>      Tender, crispy spinach is the star performer in one of the      best salads around. To make four hearty helpings of the      dish, wash and dry about a pound of greens, then tear them      into bite-sized pieces. Add 1/4 pound of raw, thinly sliced      mushrooms, and a couple of tablespoons of grated Parmesan      cheese, before tossing the salad with a light dressing ...      such as sweet-and-sour or oil-and-vinegar. (If you'd like      to dress up the vegetable salad a little, you can mix in      two or three sliced hard-cooked eggs . . . or sprinkle a      handful of whole wheat croutons over each bowl.)    </p>    <h3>SPINACH FRITTATA</h3>    <p>      This dish - the Italian version of a vegetable omelet      - contains the tried-and-true combination of greens      and eggs. First of all, steam 1 cup of freshly picked and      chopped spinach leaves, and place the cooked greens in a      large mixing bowl. Then - in a <em>separate</em> bowl      - mix together 3 eggs, 1/2 pound of grated Monterey      Jack cheese, 2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese, one      finely minced clove of garlic, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and      1/2 teaspoon of dried basil. Add the cooked spinach to this      mixture, stir it well, and spice it up with a dash of salt      and pepper.    </p>    <p>      After you've thoroughly blended all the ingredients, heat 1      tablespoon of olive oil in a heavy iron skillet. Pour in      the batter when the pan starts to sizzle, and-as soon as      the frittata begins to "set" - gently lift the      omelet's edges with a spatula . . . to let the uncooked      central portion run onto the pan. When <em>all</em> the egg      has cooked (but before the "pancake" becomes dry), fold one      half of the frittata over the other and turn it out of the      pan onto a plate. (As an alternate cooking method, you can      simply <em>bake</em> the dish, at 350°F, for half an      hour, then brown it for a couple of minutes more under the      broiler.) This savory spinach treat tastes wonderful "as      is", cut into wedges and served to four hungry folks . . .      or perhaps with a little <em>more</em> grated Parmesan used      as a topping.    </p>    <h3>SPINACH NIÇOISE</h3>    <p>      Granted, the notion does sound a bit strange, but greens      can be used to prepare a sweet course for your spring meal,      as well. This particular recipe is a variation on an apple      pie that has long been popular among the citizens of the      French city of Nice . . . and its unusual blend of flavors      will have spinach lovers lined up for seconds. To make the      Gallic dessert (which serves eight), you'll first need to      peel 6 medium-sized cooking apples. Core the fruits and      slice them thinly .. . then cut each sliver into small      (about 1/2" on a side) pieces.    </p>    <p>      Next, combine 1/4 cup of raisins and 3 tablespoons of dark      rum in a saucepan. Allow the mixture to boil for 2 or 3      minutes, then set it aside to cool. Meanwhile, cook and      drain about a pound of fresh, chopped spinach . . . and      combine the vegetable with 1/4 pound of shredded Jack      cheese, 2 well-beaten eggs, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/4      cup of chopped walnuts. Complete the filling by stirring in      the rum-soaked raisins (drain them first, if necessary) and      the diced apples.    </p>    <p>      To prepare a crust for the pie, spread two tablespoons of      apricot jam evenly over the <em>bottom</em> of an unbaked      pie shell (an eight- or nine-inch whole wheat or wheat germ      crust will work best with this recipe). Then pour in the      filling and cover it with a top crust. Use your thumb and      forefinger to seal the edges of dough all around the pie,      prick several air holes in the top with a fork, and bake      the French confection for 30 minutes at 375°F. When the      crust is golden brown, pull the pie out of the oven . . .      dust a little cinnamon on it . . . and serve it piping hot.    </p>    <p>      Every gardener knows that a healthy crop of spring greens      can be all but overwhelming at times . . . but -      using just a bit of imagination and experimentation -      you'll be surprised by the delicious fare you can whip up      from your early-season bounty. So don't just <em>boil</em>      those greens . . . put them into a variety of tasty -      <em>and</em> nutritious - dishes!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: More hints on greens cookery (and      cultivation) can be found in "Great Greens!" in MOTHER NO.      61, page 110.
