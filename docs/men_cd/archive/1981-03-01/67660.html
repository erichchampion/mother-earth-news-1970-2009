                <p>      <strong>This common plant can provide a mouthwatering wild      food delicacy for your dinner fare <em>and</em> add a      welcome remedy to your medicine cabinet!</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By William H. Beatty    </h5>        <p>      If you've ever wandered in the woodlands during a damp      spring morning - when the dew is still heavy and ol'      Sol is just <em>beginning</em> to peek over the horizon      - chances are you've caught a glimpse of a jewelweed      display. The leaves of this succulent annual (a member of      the <em>Impatiens</em> genus) are unwettable, and dew      "beads" on their surfaces. So when light strikes the tiny      water spots, the sun's rays are refracted into every hue of      the spectrum . . . providing a sight that's a match for      <em>any</em> array of costly jewels.    </p>    <p>      Later in the summer - if you happen to stroll through      a patch of the wide-ranging herb - you may suddenly      find yourself in the midst of what <em>appears</em> to be a      miniature mine field . . . as the ripened, slipper-shaped      seed pods of the jewelweed actually <em>catapult</em> their      contents when they are disturbed.    </p>    <p>      But that's about all most folks know about the slender      succulent. Here in the hills of West Virginia, though, some      people have long gathered jewelweed (also called balsam,      snapweed, touch-me-not, or quick-in-the-hand) as a wild      food delicacy <em>and</em> medicinal plant.    </p>    <h3>PICK IT PALE OR SPECKLED</h3>    <p>      There are two common species of jewelweed, and they're      easily distinguished from one another, although they are      equally tasty and identical in their medicinal      capabilities. You'll find <em>Impatiens pallida</em>      - often called the "woodland species" - along      forested stream banks and in other wet, <em>shady</em>      retreats. The pale lemon-yellow flowers characteristic of      this strain bloom from July to October.    </p>    <p>      The spotted jewelweed ( <em>Impatiens capensis</em> ) has a      slightly stronger affinity for light than does its      sun-shirking cousin, so look for its mottled butter-yellow      and reddish brown blossoms in shady <em>or</em> sunny moist      locations along brooks and roadsides, or in damp meadows.      And - since this species also sprouts a bit earlier      than the paler variety - you can begin foraging for      <em>capensis</em> sprigs in early June . . . and continue      hunting the plant through late September.    </p>    <h3>A FORAGER'S FEAST</h3>    <p>      Once you spy the slender shoots poking up through the      forest debris or waving among the meadow grasses, you're      ready to reap the first jewelweed harvest. The tender stems      - which should be collected when they're only four to      six inches high - can be prepared in a variety of      ways. I like them best cut into bite-sized morsels . . .      boiled for a total of 10 to 15 minutes in <em>two</em>      changes of slightly salted water . . . then drained and      served up with butter, plus a dash of salt and black pepper      or a sprinkle of vinegar.    </p>    <p>      I also serve jewelweed sprouts in cream sauce on toast for      a light spring supper. Furthermore, although some wild      foods guidebooks suggest that the touch-me-not shoots must      be cooked to be palatable, I've found that the      <em>very</em> young sprouts (those that are no more than      two inches high) are often tasty <em>raw</em> .    </p>    <p>      Jewelweed's <em>seeds</em> can be collected for table use      as well! The kernels in those explosive pods may be small,      but don't let that fact discourage you! The capsules'      contents are dead ringers (in terms of taste) for English      walnuts . . . and they're a whole lot less expensive than      the store-bought nutmeats.    </p>    <p>      To harvest jewelweed seeds, simply explode the pods into a      plastic bag, and then separate the eatables from the hulls      <em>after</em> you finish collecting. You can use the      free-for-the-gathering seeds to flavor your favorite      cookies, breads, and puddings.    </p>    <h3>AN ITCH ALTERNATIVE</h3>    <p>      Besides providing good table fare, jewelweed is frequently      used as a preventive for poison ivy rash. Whenever I      suspect that I've been exposed to skin-irritating poison      ivy oils, I smear some <em>juice</em> from crushed balsam      stalks on the affected spots as I traipse along, or -      after reaching home - add the strained extract from a      pound or so of <em>boiled</em> jewelweed to my bathwater      ... and I've always come out itch-free!    </p>    <p>      Jewelweed "sap" can also be made into a soothing      <em>lotion</em> for use on irritated skin. To brew up the      homemade remedy, cover a potful of the versatile plant with      water and boil the liquid down to <em>half</em> its      original volume. The strained juice can then be used      "fresh" to prevent an ivy outbreak (simply apply it to the      exposed area), or be frozen in ice cube trays.    </p>    <p>      Once the squares have solidified, transfer the medicated      ice to a plastic bag and store it in the freezer. Then, if      you should find yourself nursing a bad bout of itching in      the late fall or early spring (when jewel weed is out of      season), simply melt some of the "stashed" salve, smear it      liberally on the infected area . . . and enjoy immediate      relief!    </p>    <p>      You'll also find that the extract from the crushed stems of      <em>Impatiens</em> will help alleviate irritations caused      by contact with stinging nettles . . . and I've heard that      native Americans have long used the juice of the      touch-me-not to treat athlete's foot and other fungal skin      inflammations.    </p>    <p>      So this spring - while you're outdoors reacquainting      yourself with the beauty and bounty of Mother Nature      - get to know the jewelweed plant. It will soon      become a welcome visitor both at your supper table      <em>and</em> in your medicine cabinet!    </p>
