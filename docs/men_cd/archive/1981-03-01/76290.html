                    <h5 id="byline">     By Anne and Paul Erlich</h5>   <p>      <em>Extinction: It should concern us all!</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Ring Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences. Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to      the words "population", "resources", and "environment" in      the late 1960's. (They also coined the term coevolution,      and did a lot to make ecology the household word it is      today.) But while most folks are aware of the Ehrliehs'      popular writing in the areas of ecology and overpopulation      (most of us-for instance-have read Paul's book      The Population Bomb) ... far too few people have any idea      of how deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological      research (research of the type that tends to be published      only in technical journals and college textbooks). That's      why it pleases us to be able to present-on a regular      basis-the following semi technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <p>      As we indicated in an earlier column ("The Snail Darter and      Us", MOTHER NO. 57, page 128), the extinction of non-human      species is a matter of major concern to biologists ... and      it <em>should</em> be of extreme concern to <em>all</em>      human beings.    </p>    <p>      There are several reasons for this. First of all, the      acceleration in extinction of populations <em>-</em>      or of entire species <em>-</em> can be viewed as the      removal of essential parts (sometimes analogized with      rivets) of the life-support systems of Spaceship Earth ...      far more rapidly than natural "repair" processes can      replace them. And, although there's considerable redundancy      in such systems, the ultimate impact of continuing      extinctions is clear: the loss of essential ecosystem      services.    </p>    <p>      The services provided by ecosystems, as you may recall,      include such essentials as the amelioration of the climate,      the disposal of wastes and recycling of nutrients, the      generation and maintenance of soils, and the control of the      vast majority of crop pests and transmitters of human      diseases. Humanity has no satisfactory way of replacing      these free services should they be lost... and civilization      cannot persist without them.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, the accelerating rate of extinction is itself      a measure of the increasing level of attack that humanity      is launching on Earth's ecosystems. Each time a population      is destroyed, one less component is available to help      perform vital services for us. In short, biologists are      worried in principle about the "popping of rivets" from our      spaceship, and are frightened ... because they see the      rivets disappearing at an ever more rapid pace.    </p>    <p>      There are other reasons for concern over the extinction of      populations and species, as well ... including the fact      that the disappearance of plants or animals often results      in the loss of direct economic benefits (ecosystem services      are considered indirect benefits) and the loss of aesthetic      values. Moreover, in the name of plain old-fashioned      compassion, we should take care not to eliminate any more      of our fellow "passen gers" than we already have in the      short time man has trod this Earth.    </p>    <h3>THE PASSING OF THE PASSENGER PIGEON</h3>    <p>      The most <em>dramatic</em> cause of extinction is direct      endangering, usually by overexploitation. And <em>the</em>      classic example is the fate of the passenger pigeon. This      fascinating, graceful, pretty bird-with a slate blue      back and deep pink breast-didn't coo like a dove, but      produced "shrieks and chatters and clucks". Its greatest      claim to fame was the enormous size of its populations ...      in fact, it may well have been the most <em>abundan</em> t      bird that ever existed. John James Audubon observed a flock      that passed overhead for three days in a row, sometimes at      the incredible rate of more than 300 million birds an hour.      Alexander Wilson-cofounder, with Audubon, of American      ornithology-estimated that another flock contained      two <em>billion</em> birds! The passage of such huge      numbers in flight created a roar of wings that could      actually be heard half a dozen miles away!    </p>    <p>      These pigeons, which originally lived throughout eastern      North America, fed on the fruits of forest trees ...      especially acorns and beechnuts. They nested in narrow      colonies as much as 40 miles long and several miles across.      Their droppings in roosting areas piled up inches thick,      killing all the vegetation below the trees and-in      time-the trees themselves.    </p>    <p>      This country's early settlers had no trouble, as you'd      imagine, adding the passenger pigeon to their diets. The      nesting grounds were so crowded that adult birds were      always being injured or killed, and succulent squabs were      constantly knocked out of their nests ... so a hungry      person could simply wander through a colony and <em>pick      up</em> dinner.    </p>    <p>      As the human population increased, however, two things      began to happen: First, railroads pushed through the      wilderness and enabled professional hunters to ship the      birds to centers like New York ... and second, the great      oak and beech forests in which the birds nested began to be      cleared.    </p>    <p>      Profit hunters devised ingenious ways of killing the      pigeons in large numbers. They suffocated entire flocks by      burning grass or sulfur under their roosts ... the birds      were batted down with long sticks ... blasted with shotguns      ... fed grain soaked in alcohol and picked up dead drunk      ... or netted (after which their heads were crushed with      pincers). One trapping device depended upon a decoy      bird-with its eyes sewed shut-tied to a perch      called a "stool" ("stool pigeon" thereby became a part of      the language).    </p>    <p>      The disappearance of the species was startlingly rapid.      After the Civil War, so many millions of the birds were      shipped from the Middle West to New York that live pigeons      were even used as targets in shooting galleries. But the      huge flocks were by then already gone from the coastal      states and-by the 1880's-were dwindling      everywhere. In 1878 one hunter shipped some three million      birds from Michigan, the passenger pigeon's final      stronghold. The last wild bird was seen in that state just      11 years later, and the final captive pigeon died in the      Cincinnati Zoo in 1914. Her name was Martha.    </p>    <h3>A DELICATE BALANCE</h3>    <p>      Economic extinction (reduction of the passenger pigeon      population to a level where hunting was no longer      profitable) preceded biological extinction. The last birds      in the wild were not killed by <em>Homo sapiens</em> , but      perished as a result of "natural causes". Habitat      destruction was not a major factor, however, because even      today large areas of forest suitable for the pigeons exist      in the eastern United States. Apparently the ability to      form huge flocks was essential to the birds' survival. Once      their populations became too small to maintain sufficiently      large breeding colonies, nesting failures, inbreeding, and      mortality from predation must have escalated and pushed the      species to extinction.    </p>    <p>      Other species, too, are known to have been wiped out by      direct human intervention. The dodo, a flightless bird that      once inhabited Mauritius, was eliminated a couple of      centuries ago by early European settlers. Its story is not      as well documented as is that of the passenger pigeon...      but the fact is commemorated in the phrase "dead as a      dodo". Furthermore, at least it's <em>suspected</em> that      thousands of years ago-at the end of the last glacial      epoch-Stone-Age hunters played a major role in the      extermination of many species of large mammals ...      including mammoths, woolly rhinos, and ground sloths Today,      numerous other species are endangered as a result of human      persecution. Elephants are slaughtered for their ivory ...      rhinos for their horns (thought by some cultures to have      aphrodisiac qualities) ... whales for their meat ...      cheetahs, snow leopards, and other cats because they      threaten livestock ... and antelopes for "sport". Sea      turtles are chased for their shells, and their nests are      robbed of eggs. Collectors pay large sums for rare fishes,      amphibians, reptiles, and especially birds. And, closer to      home, the "cactus craze" has become so extreme that many      species are faced with extinction ... even national parks      are being stripped of these key desert plants.    </p>    <p>      Primates-monkeys, gibbons, chimps, and      gorillas-are much sought for medical research. (The      standard practice in collecting primates is to shoot a      group of adults and then capture the young!) Unhappily, the      research is much too often poorly designed and utterly      useless. And saddest of all, only a small proportion of the      specimens gathered for experiments or collections ever      survive the journey.    </p>    <h3>CRUEL EVICTIONS</h3>    <p>      In spite of all this, the second major cause of      extinction-habitat destruction-is much more      important than the first. For every species and population      endangered because of direct human action,      <em>thousands</em> are threatened by the inadvertent loss      of suitable places in which to live. Often these are      relatively obscure organisms-insects and other      invertebrates, small plants, and so on-whose jeopardy      or eventual passing goes completely unmarked.    </p>    <p>      For example, the plight of the Bay checkerspot butterfly is      typical of <em>many</em> temperate-zone organisms. The      insects occupy patches of serpentine grassland in the San      Francisco Bay area, where the food plants required by their      caterpillars grow. Long-term research has shown that the      separate populations of this insect are subject to periodic      extinction by drought, and it's suspected that other      colonies may occasionally be wiped out by the fires that      maintain the local chaparral habitat.    </p>    <p>      But before the Bay Area was developed, the losses were not      catastrophic. The vacant "islands" of serpentine grass      would be repopulated, after a decade or so, by migrant      individuals from a nearby island where the butterflies had      survived. Thus, a shifting checkerboard of populations      persisted.    </p>    <p>      Things began to change late in the last century, however,      as the <em>human</em> population of San Francisco and its      suburbs grew. Gradually, islands of serpentine became sites      of human habitation. The entire process accelerated rapidly      following World War II, as servicemen returning from the      Pacific decided to settle in beautiful California. More and      more checkerspot colonies disappeared under homes, shopping      centers, fast food outlets, and freeways.    </p>    <p>      Then, during the mid-1970's, a drought pushed additional      populations to extinction. As a result, the Bay checkerspot      is now endangered. The few remaining populations are      probably too far from the "empty" islands for migrant      individuals to repopulate them before extinction overtakes      the still existing colonies.    </p>    <p>      Habitat destruction, of course-in the form of the      conversion of its river home into a lake behind the Tellico      Dam-is the sole threat to the snail darter. The      conversion of virgin land to cities, farms, and pasture is      decimating the rich flora of South Africa's Cape region ...      threatening an orchid in Russia ... and destroying a      beautiful buttercup in New Zealand.    </p>    <h3>THE DESTRUCTION GROWS</h3>    <p>      The list is long and depressing. <em>All</em> the fish      populations in some 300 Adirondack lakes have been      exterminated by acid rains. Siberian tigers are      disappearing as their forest home is cleared. Desert      animals and plants in the American Southwest are being      destroyed by offroad vehicles (a carefully driven dirt bike      degrades an acre of land in a 20-mile journey ... a      four-wheel-drive vehicle, more than three acres in the same      distance). Rats, goats, burros, mongooses, and various      other animal and plant "weeds" that have been moved around      by humanity so degrade habitats that native      species-especially on islands-go extinct      wholesale.    </p>    <p>      All over the globe, at an ever-increasing pace, populations      of all sorts of organisms are being paved over, plowed      under, grazed away, flooded out, stripmined, poisoned,      invaded, and-above all-destroyed as forests are      cleared. This last cause of extinction is especially      serious because of the mounting assault on tropical rain      forests (see "Hope for the Tropical Forests?", MOTHER NO.      53, page 110), which may contain two-fifths or more of      <em>all</em> the Earth's species. If current trends      continue, most of this enormous reservoir of life's      diversity will be gone early in the next century ... and      our spaceship may have lost enough rivets to make the      survival of society impossible!    </p>    <p>      <em>For more details on the way other organisms are forced      to extinction and a discussion of ecosystem services and      the consequences of their loss, see Extinction by P.
