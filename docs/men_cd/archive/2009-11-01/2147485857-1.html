        The jar of honey in this photo will be used to brew several gallons of mead. The brewing process is fast — it only takes about an hour. But it will be quite some time before the mead is ready to drink. Mead should age for a minimum of one year. The glasses in this photo are filled with mead that has been allowed to age for five years.
