        <p>In the process of addressing climate change, the United States could net 4.5 million jobs in renewable energy and energy efficiency fields by 2030, according to a new study.</p><p>The report, “Estimating the Jobs Impact of Tackling Climate Change,” was prepared for the <a href="http://www.ases.org/" target="_blank">American Solar Energy Society</a> by Management Information Services Inc. The report finds that an estimated 1.2 billion tons of annual carbon emissions could be eliminated by 2030 through renewable energy and energy efficiency alone, if the country makes a serious commitment to reversing climate change.</p><p>According to the report, about 57 percent of the reduction in carbon emissions would be from energy efficiency, and 43 percent would be from renewable energy. Professions that would gain the most jobs include farming, construction, professional services, trucking, and metal fabrication, with job benefits spread across the entire country. The greatest numbers of renewable energy jobs would be in solar power, biomass power and biofuels.</p><p></p><hr /><h5>Reprinted from <a title="EERE Network News" href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm" target="_blank">EERE Network News</a>, a free newsletter from the U.S. Department of Energy.</h5>
