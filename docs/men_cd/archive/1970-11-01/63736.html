                <p>      ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN<br />      VOCATIONS FOR SOCIAL CHANGE    </p>        <p>      Here are some hints on getting food, heat and other      necessities for free or a fraction of their usual cost -      not by forging off into the wilderness with guns and axes,      but by taking advantage of the waste in our affluent      economy. They may require some adjustments in attitude and      taste if you have been conditioned into believing that      everything you acquire should be new and shiny, but the      savings and the satisfaction of creative consumption will      soon win you over.<br />    </p>    <p>      Eat garbage! Seriously, check out the bins in back of your      neighborhood supermarket. You will find a steady supply of      fruits and vegetables that have been discarded - some      because they are truly rotten - but most because they have      bruises and blemishes that make them "unattractive". Wash      them off, cut out the bad parts, and you have perfectly      wholesome food for free. In our last foray we bagged eleven      artichokes, two pounds of zucchini squash, about one-half      dozen each of apples, oranges, bananas, a very large sack      of mushrooms, a head of cabbage, and all of the lettuce,      celery and bell peppers we cared to haul away. If you can't      quite stomach this form of procurement, go in with your      friends and neighbors and buy your produce by the crate      directly from the wholesalers. They do not care who they      sell to, and you will be amazed at the difference in      price.<br />      <br />      If you are living in a large city, your heating bills may      not be very high, but where we live it costs about $35 per      month to heat a house with bottled butane gas. If you are      in a similar situation, you should be heating with wood. If      you are lucky, you may come across an old wood stove, but      they are fast becoming antiques, and new ones are quite      expensive. The best solution is to make a barrel stove from      a 50 gallon oil drum (which you can get for a few dollars      at scrap metal yards). With a little bit of work they make      excellent heaters that will warm very large areas. Try      locating an outlet that has army surplus kits with the      extra parts needed for conversion, (doors, grate, etc.)      Naturally, you get your wood free. Big pieces come from      timbers and poles that have been left to rot. Small ones      cut to length can be had from the scrap piles of companies      that make fences, packing crates, etc. (On the subject of      free heat, our friend Ray Mungo sent us an elaborate      description of a giant communal bed that he and his friends      in Vermont built. It stands four feet off the floor - the      principle being that heat rises, and the closer you are to      the ceiling, the warmer you'll be!)<br />      <br />      Buy your clothes, household furnishings, etc. used at      Goodwill and Salvation Army stores, rummage sales, etc. If      you do any of your own building or remodeling (you should -      someone in your community can no doubt help you if you are      inexperienced) try to salvage materials from buildings that      are being demolished, or buy them used from wrecking      companies.<br />      <br />      These are some ways that we have found to stretch those      subsistence dollars. If you have hit upon others, let us      know!<br />    </p>
