    <p>
                        <p>      Although locating a suitable homestead and obtaining      reasonable purchase arrangements may seem difficult, it      definitely is possible for almost anyone with a little cash      and a steady income to buy a farm today. If you can scrape      up enough bread for a down payment, this article should      help you find a farm you can afford and arrange a mortgage      that you can handle.    </p>    <p>      Practically all available farmland and land suitable for      farming in this country is privately owned. Little      government homestead land left in the continental United      States is suitable for farming. The few small tracts of      public land available from time to time are mostly located      in the semi-arid western states and it requires an immense      effort and considerable resources to make such acreage pay.      The absence of farm buildings, a house, available water,      tillable soil and utilities raises many questions about the      practicality of such a venture. It's better to consider      buying an inexpensive existing farm in a remote area before      exploring the purchase of public land.    </p>    <p>      But, if you're dead-set on homesteading, buying or leasing      government land-or if you've located a tract suitable      for farming-write to the <em>Bureau of Land      Management, Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C.      20240.</em> The lease or purchase of public land is      authorized by the Public Sale Act of 1964; Public Law      88-608; 78 STAT 988. Homesteads are granted following a      personal inspection of the land provided that the tract has      been classified as suitable for farming by the Bureau of      Land Management. Remember, though, you'll need cash to      build a shelter and develop even the free land.    </p>    <p>      New land suitable for farming may be developed by improved      drainage, irrigation or reclamation projects conducted by      the <em>Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of the      Interior.</em> Such land is often sold immediately (Usually      to large "development" corporations that have an inside      pipeline to the most desirable chunks of property if the      large holdings recently opened in coastal North Carolina,      Louisiana and other states are any indication-JS).      When private land affected by reclamation projects is      offered for sale, the project manager should be consulted      to determine whether or not such land will actually benefit      by the project.    </p>    <p>      There is much land suitable for homesteads in Alaska but,      until the federal government settles all existing claims      against it by the natives of that state (this settlement is      to be made early in 1971), new homestead grants are being      withheld. Further information about public land in Alaska      may be obtained from the <em>Bureau of Land Management,      Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C. 20240;      Manager, Land Office, Anchorage, Alaska 99501; or Manager,      Land Office, Fairbanks, Alaska 99701.</em>    </p>    <p>      The vast majority of farms and farm tracts purchased in the      United States are bought from private owners and are      usually financed by mortgages. The acreage is usually      located through advertisements in small area newspapers,      major Sunday papers, shopping guides, farm journals and      farm real estate listings.    </p>    <p>      Again, in case you're interested, there is private land in      Alaska available for sale or lease. To obtain information      about climate, farming conditions and markets for produce      in the areas that interest you, write to <em>Director,      Alaska Agricultural Experiment Station, Palmer, Alaska      99645.</em>    </p>    <p>      When you've selected the part of the country where you'd      like to settle, you're ready to begin the search for that      "perfect" farm. It's not really necessary to limit your      choice to an economically depressed or underdeveloped area,      either. Although prices are generally much lower in some      sections of the country (such as the Ozarks) than others,      you can still find a good farm at a reasonable figure      almost anywhere. Land values are skyrocketing around      Cleveland, for instance, yet-a few weeks ago-I      saw a good 31-acre farm for $11,000 . . . and it was within      an hour's drive of that city's downtown area. Bargains such      as this can be found if you consider a few important points      when looking for a farm.    </p>    <p>      The first fact to consider is that the farther you are from      a major city or suburban development, the less costly land      should be. Acreage near freeway interchanges, expressways      and important highways is generally more expensive than      less accessible land. There is little point in paying for      valuable frontage property if you intend to use it for      growing vegetables. If you want your homestead to remain a      homestead, try to locate it in the least likely path of      future suburban sprawl . . . probably at the maximum      economical distance from your job, business or market area.    </p>    <p>      Second, if you're trying to hold the cost of your land down      to a bargain level, you should not buy any more land than      you can reasonably or economically use. A small family or      parttime farm need be no larger than fifty acres. Even this      is stretching it for practical purposes. A one-acre garden,      well planned, can produce enough food for two families. One      cow will give from 10 to 20 quarts of milk per day.      Thousands of families have established abundant homesteads      on five acres or less. There is little point in passing up      a nice little farm just to obtain a lot of acreage. A      little thirty-acre homestead-too small to farm      profitably in a "traditional" manner-can supply your      basic needs and keep the suburbs from your back door. A      small outside income or-possibly-ten acres of      organically grown produce for the increasing market will      bring home the "extras" that you might desire.    </p>    <p>      Third, avoid paying for prime farmland in locations known      as "fruit belts". Unless you intend to specialize in      certain fruit crops there is little reason to purchase land      in such regions. Available orchards and vineyards in my      area (40 miles east of Cleveland) are priced absurdly high      regardless of their condition or age. Even the nearby farms      that have no orchards or grapes are unreasonably expensive      due to local conditions that are favorable for growing      those fruits. A new interstate highway through our area      directly into Cleveland has also boosted land costs.    </p>    <p>      Fourth, you will soon discover that "wild land", overgrown      with weeds and unused for years, can be much richer and,      probably, less expensive than land which is currently in      production. Even when crops are properly rotated, they must      be hyped with chemical fertilizers to meet today's demands      for record yields. As far as the land is concerned, this      pushing does little more than further deplete the soil.      Corn crops especially rob the earth of many precious      nutrients which are riot readily restored. Wild land which      has not been drained by cash crops and which-to boot-is      probably less expensive can, therefore, be a double      bargain. It may well contain more nutrients than      "developed" soil and subsequent plantings by proper organic      methods can maintain and even increase this natural wealth.    </p>    <p>      Don't pass up rolling countryside or hillside acreage.      Those Appalachian farmsteads are not only beautifully      scenic and remote . . . the land is generally excellent for      gardening. Most of this soil has been avoided by commercial      and large farming operations, is quite rich and-as long as      there is any heavy wild annual growth to prevent      erosion-you can garden in strips across the slope. Hillside      farms have other advantages: They often sell for as little      as $20 an acre; excess water never gets a chance to stand      around long enough to rot crops; frost problems are less      serious because currents flowing down the slopes on cold      nights prevent the development of pockets of stable cold      air. Besides, who ever found a hillside to be an obstacle      for goats?    </p>    <p>      Finally, the cost of labor and materials being what it is      today (not even considering inferior workmanship), one is      well advised to purchase a farm with existing buildings . .      . even if some repairs are needed. If you take the time to      look, you're almost sure to find a tract of reasonably      priced land with a house and some decent buildings thrown      in "for free".    </p>    <p>      Once you've located your homestead, there are a number of      ways to arrange financing. If you know what they are, you      can ,save yourself a sizeable sum on interest rates, your      payments can be substantially less and you can avoid the      usual finder's fee by arranging your own mortgage. Here's      what is generally available:    </p>    <p>      LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES have broad investment powers and      are often the best bet for financing an off-beat real      estate transaction. Some of the smaller concerns deal      almost exclusively with residential mortgages and the      little private and fraternal insurance companies can lend      at an extremely low interest rate. American Mutual Life      Association of Cleveland, for instance, now makes loans at      6% to its members which isn't bad in today's market of 8      1/2%. These small companies seldom require the payment of      discounts or "points".    </p>    <p>      SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS are the major source of      mortgage funds for residential purchases. The usual loan      limits are $40,000 with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of      90% and an average of 70%. However, since farmland is often      bought at less than its appraised value on today's market      and since it is possible to obtain maximum loans on      exceptionally good purchases, you might finance your      acreage with virtually no out-of-pocket cash through a S      & L:    </p>    <p>      I bought a suburban home through a Savings and Loan bank.      It was willing to finance the entire selling price so that      I only had to pay the closing costs . . . which were less      than the security deposit I would have had to make on an      apartment. The market value of my home has now increased      enough to finance the down payment for a farm when I sell.    </p>    <p>      The new FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION has been set      up to purchase both conventional and government mortgages      with greater flexibility than in the past and to increase      the supply of money available for home mortgages.      Conventional financing has been encouraged to provide for      lower down payments, longer payoff periods and lower      monthly payments-particularly for low and      middle-income families. Authoritative sources indicate that      new laws enacted by congress should provide for even more      federally subsidized housing at lower interest rates during      the next few years.    </p>    <p>      The FARMERS HOME ADMINISTRATION Farm Ownership Program      currently makes 40-year loans at 5% interest for the      purchase, enlargement or development of farms no larger      than family farms for persons unable to obtain required      credit elsewhere. Maximum loan plus debts against the farm      cannot exceed $60,000. To qualify, you must be certified by      the local County Farmers Home Administration as qualified      to farm. "Qualified" usually means that you have had farm      experience. Veterans are given preferential treatment. Once      you have enough equity in your farm through full-time      operation, you are expected to refinance through a      conventional mortgage.    </p>    <p>      The Farmers Home Administration also makes loans for the      purchase of small farms if the applicant is considered      eligible and has dependable off-farm income. The applicant      must plan to continue farming part-time. If rural housing      is desired, any individual who is unable to obtain      sufficient credit elsewhere may qualify for a mortgage      loan. For further specific information, contact the local      Farmers Home Administration office in your county seat town      or write to the <em>Farmers Home Administration, Department      of Agriculture, Washington, D. C 20250.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>FEDERAL LAND BANKS</strong> make long-term farm      mortgages through 700 local Federal Land Banks and their      associates (This is how the family farm back in Indiana was      financed-JS). The Land Banks and associations are      owned cooperatively by their member borrowers. Funds are      obtained from the investing public through the sale of      Federal farm loan bonds. First mortgage loans are arranged      for persons who are-or will be-engaged in      farming and who will derive a principal part of their      income from farming. For more details, contact the <em>Farm      Credit Administration, Washington, D.C. 20578</em> or a      local Federal Land Bank or association.    </p>    <p>      INDIVIDUAL LENDERS who are willing to make greater risk      loans than a lending institution will handle are to be      found in almost any community. These individuals usually      prefer short term loans and charge a higher rate of      interest. They may be a last alternative for a      hard-to-finance deal.    </p>    <p>      PURCHASE MONEY MORTGAGES are another alternative to usual      financing sometimes used by real estate dealers during      periods of tight money. A seller to (1) get his price and      (2) save a considerable amount in taxes [as long as he      receives no more than 30% of the sale price during the year      of the sale] will sometimes "carry the paper" when      sufficient loan money is not otherwise available.    </p>    <p>      A SECOND MORTGAGE can often be arranged on the difference      between the loan value on a property and the actual asking      price. If the seller has sufficient credit to arrange a      ventional mortgage he can finance the balance through a      second mortgage on the same terms as the first mortgage      (and he may ask for a percentage from the buyer for      arranging the deal). The buyer may have the right to prepay      on the second mortgage and the seller can sell the second      mortgage to a third party at a discount. By "inflating" the      sale price, the seller can make up any loss he might      realize on a discount.    </p>    <p>      LAND CONTRACTS should be considered when there is little      money for a down payment but funds may be available in the      future for larger payments. Through a standard land      contract agreement one can arrange an installment purchase.      The seller may obtain the balance of the sale price over      the existing mortgage by pledging his own credit for a loan      with the land contract as security. The buyer assumes the      existing mortgage payment plus payments due under the      seller's loan. The seller retains title and is covered in      case of default by the buyer. Seller may also stipulate      that all installment payments may be liquidated if the      buyer defaults. In this manner, land contracts are      encouraged without the risk of complicated foreclosure      proceedings following default. The FHA does not insure      installment sales but will continue to insure any existing      FHA mortgage even though an installment purchase has been      made. Once the buyer is able to refinance the total debt      with an outside mortgage, he obtains title from the seller.    </p>    <p>      A TRADE-IN or a swap may be arranged if you already have      property. Such arrangements are common and can be      beneficial to all parties, especially during periods of      tight money. On occasion, you may find a farm widow or      widower who wants to move to the suburbs or the city. Any      difference in costs can be managed by a second mortgage      payment.    </p>    <p>      Alternatives to individual ownership ought to be considered      if resources and credit are limited. Several individuals      may join together to purchase land that they couldn't      obtain otherwise. Several joint arrangements may be      considered:    </p>    <p>      JOINT TENANCY: Two or more individuals have the same      ownership interest in a single parcel. In a joint tenancy      agreement each owns all, with the right of survivorship.      This arrangement seems best for tribes or communes,      especially when one individual pays more than his share in      costs, in which case he may take a full deduction on taxes.    </p>    <p>      TENANCY IN COMMON: Two or more individuals each with the      same right to possession and benefits according to his      share of ownership. There are no rights of survivorship. A      tax liability arises when one tenant pays more than his      share of costs.    </p>    <p>      Although PARTNERSHIPS are the most common form of      unincorporated arrangement and offer certain business      advantages, they are least desirable as an alternative to      purchasing a hip farmstead. Various tax factors and other      considerations affect the partnership to creat a good      possibility for future hassles between partners. The      Treasury Department carefully scrutinizes partnerships to      insure that they are not set up as corporations.    </p>    <p>      An interesting federal program that appears to offer      promise for any joint ownership consideration is in the      National Housing Act's Public Law 73-479, Section 213. This      provides for technical advice and assistance from the      Federal Housing Administration in planning, organizing,      developing, constructing and operating cooperative housing      for five or more dwelling units. This program may be used      to finance a communal venture and may provide an excellent      way to finance building on inexpensive land when little      cash is available. Loans are available for up to 97% of the      estimated value of property for continued use as a      cooperative. According to one source, mortgage limits are      $9,000 per family unit without a bedroom; $12,500 per      family unit with one bedroom; $15,000 per family unit with      two bedrooms; $18,500 per family unit with three bedrooms      and $21,000 per family unit with four or more bedrooms.      Maximum mortgage maturity is 40 years.    </p>    <p>      To qualify for the National Housing Act program, one must      form a nonprofit cooperative ownership housing corporation      or a nonprofit cooperative ownership housing trust.      Permanent occupancy of the dwellings is restricted to the      members or beneficiaries of the corporation or trust. The      mortgage must cover the properties of the corporation or      trust.    </p>    <p>      For further information, specific details and/or advice,      contact the <em>Federal Housing Administration, Department      of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, D. C.      20411</em> or any of its regional offices (New York,      Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Ft. Worth, San Francisco      and San Juan, Puerto Rico).    </p>    <p>      Section 233 of the same law authorizes the FHA to insure      mortgages on properties where advanced technical housing      design, materials and construction or experimental      neighborhood design produce a significant reduction in      costs or improve quality. Although the FHA has      traditionally fostered conventional construction methods      (often inferior in quality and workmanship) the terminology      in this law may provide the basis for a pilot project you      might develop on your own land. It is certainly worth      exploring.    </p>    <p>      Under FHA's Section 203 (i) program of mortgage insurance      for homes in outlying areas, a home buyer must make a down      payment of 3%. On the old maximum ceiling of $13,500, the      down payment on such a loan would be only $405.    </p>    <p>      Several additional FEDERAL ASSISTANCE programs are worth      considering before rushing out to sign that mortgage      contract. For a complete catalog of Federal Assistance      programs write to the <em>Office of Economic Opportunity,      Washington, D. C. 20506.</em>    </p>    <p>      Whatever you decide about mortgaging the purchase of your      farm, it's a good idea to check back with MOTHER NO. 2, the      Special Issue on finding and establishing a homestead, for      some final tips before the deal is closed.    </p>    <p>      GOOD LUCK!    </p>
