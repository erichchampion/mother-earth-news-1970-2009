                  <h5 id="byline">by VICTOR A. CROLEY</h5>        <p>      Mid-continent pioneers were mainly English, Scots and Irish      whose fathers had followed Boone from the Piedmont across      the Appalachian mountains into Tennessee and Kentucky.      There, when the war of 1812 broke out, sons and footloose      males enlisted to march and fight in Canada. Returning from      this fruitless and ill-timed venture, the soldiers were      rewarded with land grant bonuses in the newly-opened      Arkansas Territory. Many married, started a family and      moved west. Some intermarried with the civilized Indian      nations-the Cherokees and Creeks-of the Big      Smokies.    </p>    <p>      These pioneers were familiar with wilderness living and at      home on the sparsely settled. frontiers of our growing      country. Already many, like Boone, were beginning to feel      crowded and in need of elbow room and fresh scenery.    </p>    <p>      The men were hunters and trappers for the most part. Game      was plentiful and meat could be had for the shooting at      almost every cabin door. Their cash crops were bear skins,      bear bacon and bear grease which was used for lubrication,      for cooking, as a butter substitute and to slick down      rebellious hair. But mainly the frontiersmen were      self-sufficient: They mined lead for balls for their      muzzle-loading rifles; they made gunpowder from powdered      charcoal, sulphur and the saltpeter found in bat caves.    </p>    <p>      Wives and mothers were capable gardeners and had brought      with them bean, pumpkin, turnip and a few other vegetable      seeds. And, of course, flowers. They had zinnias, which      they called "Old Maids", and balsam, which they knew as      "Touch-me-nots" and a living sucker of purple lilac which      soon flourished at every cabin door.    </p>    <p>      Many of the early arrivals came on foot, with pack horses      or driving heavy-laden cows. Some even trundled their few      household goods in wheelbarrows along the forest traits.      Roads, over which oxen could draw covered wagons, had yet      to be cleared. Under these conditions, space was at a      premium and food supplies had to be light in weight and      easily portable. Modern methods of canning in glass jars      were still unknown and the diet of fresh meat was      supplemented by foods the pioneer wife could preserve by      drying. She was amazingly adept at this, and quick to learn      new techniques from the Indian women who were her      neighbors.    </p>    <p>      One of the most common dishes bore the colloquial name of      "leather-britches." It was simply green beans, patiently      threaded on a stout string and dried. The rafters of a      well-stocked cabin would be festooned with strands of these      dried beans. When the home-maker wished to prepare a meal      she had to plan well ahead, for the dried beans needed to      be soaked twenty-four hours and longer to soften. They were      then cooked with salt and perhaps a chunk of bear bacon or      fat-back from a home-butchered hog. Dried shelled beans      were, of course, a familiar food, as were cornfield peas      (usually the crowder variety of black-eye peas.) Pumpkins      were peeled, cut into narrow strips and dried for late      winter use beyond the season of cave-stored vegetables and      fruits.    </p>    <p>      The year around staple was corn and every family tried to      grow enough to provide meal from one growing season to the      next. Times were hard when the corn ran short and, as soon      as the fresh crop had reached the firm kernel stage, the      pioneer mother used it to make "gritted" or grated bread.      This was a delicious pudding-like bread that much resembled      the familiar spoonbreads.    </p>    <p>      Corn was also made into hominy, and hominy was often dried      for "grits". Roasting ears were a welcome treat in season      and the pioneers learned to preserve this delicacy by      cutting the cooked kernels from the cob and drying them.      This dried precooked corn could be reconstituted by soaking      in water and cooking. The process yielded a delightfully      different, caramelized flavor unknown to modern homemakers.    </p>    <p>      Popcorn was also grown, and one old-timer tells of a great      grandmother who used popcorn to prepare a breakfast cereal      long before the days of the patented, packaged puffed      gains. She popped the corn, ground it coarsely and served      it in a bowl with sorghum and rich, spring-cooled cream.    </p>    <p>      Corn was also the K-ration when game and other foods were      scarce and for hunters on prolonged trips. In the War      between the States it was nearly standard fare for the      hard-fighting Confederates. Corn was (and still is) light,      portable, almost non-perishable and easily prepared. It can      even be eaten raw: Soaked overnight and parched in a      skillet with a bit of bacon or pork fat, this gain made a      nourishing and sustaining battle ration for those with      sound teeth and stout jaw muscles. And when corn gave out,      large sweet acorns were often gathered and parched (see      <em>FOOD WITHOUT FARMING in MOTHER</em> NO. 3) as a      satisfying substitute. Seeds of apple, peach and pear trees      were carried to their new homes by the settlers and soon      grew into flourishing, fruitful trees. Apples were peeled,      cored, sliced into rings and dried; peaches were simply      halved and dried; and pears were similarly treated although      usually an effort was made to remove the seeds.    </p>    <p>      Wild fruits such as strawberries, huckleberries, fox gapes,      raspberries, blackberries, sarvis berries, currants and      gooseberries were dried and used as we use raisins. They      could also be soaked in water and cooked into sauces or      made into pies, tarts and cobblers, as were the dried tree      fruits. Wild persimmons were gathered in season, carefully      pulped and spread out to dry into "persimmon leather." This      was a quarter-inch thick, tough, leather-like article (see      <em>PERSIMMONS in MOTHER NO. 5)</em> which would keep      indefinitely and, when wanted, could be cut into small      pieces for soaking and cooking.    </p>
