                <p>      There seems to be almost as many ways of making compost as      there are gardeners. Jeanie Darlington gave us her recipe      for a compost pile in Issue No.<br /> Three and briefly described      a method of composting in the ground in No. Four. Still, we      find that some folks (new to organic gardening) continue to      worry about the<br /> seemingly magical transformation of garbage      into rich, black soil. So here, one more time (A HEAP Of      Help For The Gardener), is a more-or-less standard set of<br />      directions for making compost. Then-just in case you      start worrying about what to put in and what to put out of      your compost, how long to let the pile set<br /> before turning      it, whether or not to add "activators", etc.-we'll      direct your attention to the two pieces on the BOTTOM of      this double page spread. Get the idea?<br /> Dump your garbage      together and stand back. It's almost impossible to      fail!<br />    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by JAMES STOUT    </h5>    <p>      The compost pile or "heap"-a mixture of decayed      vegetable matter sometimes combined with manure-is an      invaluable, yet inexpensive, device for providing the      gardener with top-grade soil. Through the work of harmless      bacteria, raw organic matter is converted-or      "composted"-into humus. This humus is excellent plant      food and improves the soil in many ways. A compost pile is      built of substances such as dead leaves, lawn cuttings,      left-over vegetables from the kitchen, manure, fertilizer,      straw, rich topsoil and soft clippings from trees and      shrubs. Grass, weeds and kitchen waste may be used in great      quantity, as they decay very rapidly. Leaves, hay, sawdust,      cornstalks and straw are slower and require a longer      decomposition period.</p><p> Materials that resist decay or should      otherwise not be used are diseased plants (which should be      burned), bones, meat, grease, animal fat, grapefruit or      orange skins, woody plants, twigs, branches, weeds with      ripe seeds and leaves from the oak, beech or pine tree.</p><p> The      restrictions upon leaves and fruit skins are not mandatory      to anyone but the serious gardener. These materials will      not ruin the compost pile but may lower its value somewhat.      They also require a longer period of time for total decay.</p><p>      Many people feel that it's easier and safer to compost      leaves than to burn them. The trade of fire, smoke and      worthless ashes for valuable humus certainly makes good      ecological sense. Leaves decompose at a slower rate than      other compost, however, and can retard the natural      processing of a mixed heap. The solution is to segregate      them into a separate pile where-at the end of two      years-they'll yield excellent leaf mold.</p><p> Vegetable      cuttings from the kitchen are one of the easiest substances      to compost. Cooked or uncooked, they contribute greatly to      the process.    </p>    <h3>PREPARATION AND CONSTRUCTION</h3>    <p>      The compost pile should be built in a shaded area to lessen      its chance of drying out. Remember though, that      wood-rotting fungi in wet compost makes it impractical to      stack the heap right against trees or any wooden structure.</p><p>      Form the pile into a compact, regular shape      (indiscriminate, strung-out dumping can produce poor humus,      insects and other problems), with the top indented to catch      and hold rainwater. The sides will naturally slope inward      but the degree of slope should be as little as possible,      otherwise water will run down the sides and be lost.</p><p>      Bacteria that thrive on both oxygen and moist (but not      damp) conditions are the fastest working composters and      both air and water must penetrate the layers of a heap to      keep them happy. For this reason a compost pile should not      exceed five feet in height.</p><p> Best results are obtained by      alternating layers of vegetable matter with layers of soil,      sod and manure. To hasten decomposition and improve the      quality of the compost, add to each layer a sprinkling of      ground limestone, phosphate rock, bone meal, blood meal,      tankage or sewer sludge. Some folks add special      "activators" also but a controlled test at Michigan State      University has shown that such activators do not improve      composting action at all as long as a pile has plenty of      nitrogen in the form of manure, sewer sludge, bone meal,      blood meal or other materials rich in this element.    </p>    <p>      By varying the ratio of soil, rock powder, vegetable and      animal matter a compost pile can be given a highly      individualistic character and you can use this flexibility      to "tailor make" humus for a particular crop. In the      beginning, however, any compost is better than no compost      at all: Layer whatever you have available into a heap and      let nature take its course.</p><p> When your pile has reached the      desired height (remember the indentation in the top!),      cover it with a layer of top soil. Sir Albert Howard, the      original developer of today's refined composting      techniques, recommends 1/8" of urine soaked soil for this      covering. If your heap is on a small city lot, you may want      to substitute a heavier layer of plain top soil to control      moisture and odor.</p><p> While your first pile decomposes, you      may start another. By having two-or several-at      various stages of decay, you'll be assured of a constant      supply of humus.    </p>    <h3>MAINTENANCE</h3>    <p>      As the materials decompose, the silt will grow smaller. It      should be kept moist by occasional watering but this may      not be necessary if the indentation on top catches enough      rainwater.</p><p> After about three months, your compost pile      should be "turned" to thoroughly mix the layers, put the      outside materials into the middle and allow a fresh supply      of air into the center for the <em>aerobic,</em> or      oxygen-hungry bacteria. Every time new compost is exposed,      it should be covered with soil or, if an alkali humus is      preferred, lime. The materials will then decay uniformly.</p><p>      As a substitute for turning the pile even once, try this:      After the three month period, cover your heap with a sheet      of black polyethylene and weight the plastic on all sides      to prevent it from blowing away. This polyethylene      eliminates the necessity of turning and watering the pile      and-by holding moisture in and absorbing heat from      the sun-encourages <em>anaerobic</em> (air-less)      decomposition.</p><p> If no new material is added, the compost      will be ready for use in about nine months to a year from      the time it was "finished".    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO USE COMPOST    </h3>    <p>      The compost can be used when it is crumbly in your hand and      has the appearance of dark, rich soil. It is ideal as      potting soil for house plants and for starting young      seedlings. A small amount added each year to flower beds      will help keep them in good condition. In sufficient      quantity, it makes an excellent lawn dressing.    </p>    <p>      For garden use, compost may be applied just as it is taken      from the well-rotted heap. In making potting soil or      filling greenhouse benches, it's best to screen compost      through 1/2" mesh wire to remove any stones, sticks, or      coarse material. The latter may be used as mulch or as the      bottom layer of a new pile.    </p>    <p>      Decayed compost improves the quality of any soil to which      it is added. With compost, sandy soil retains more moisture      and heavy clay mellows and becomes easier to handle. The      compost helps retain moisture, increases humus content,      supplies plant food, allows air to enter the soil, prevents      crusting, reduces erosion, controls soil temperatures,      lessens evaporation and discourages weeds. It's a heap of      help for the gardener.    </p>
