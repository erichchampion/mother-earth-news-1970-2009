                    <p>      Look out the window at that weather ...howling winds;      temperature cycling through freezes and thaws; snow, hail      and sleet cutting the air. It sure is great to be inside a      snug house on days like this ...especially if that house      has a basement root cellar and pantry well stocked with      home-grown, canned and preserved produce.    </p>    <p>      But wait a minute ...what about the garden that gave you      that harvest? If you just left the soil lying out there in      the elements, naked, chances are the pickings won't be so      bountiful next summer.    </p>    <p>      You can do your garden, a foul weather favor and save its      valuable topsoil with (1) mulch and (2) green manure. These      two brands of organic judo <em>will</em> effectively turn      Ole Man Winter's blows into constructive forces that will      actually mellow and improve the family vegetable plot.    </p>    <p>      Mulching is especially easy: Just gather up all the plant      materials you can find and <em>concentrate</em> the natural      process of decomposition where it will have the most      effect. You'll be doing the air a favor too by recycling      those leaves instead of burning them.    </p>    <p>      Green manure adds a slightly more sophisticated touch to      your gardening program. The word "manure", by the way,      suggests the nutrients-which you can      liberate-locked in this most basic of Nature's      fertilizers.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes known as "cover crops", green manures are grown      not for harvesting but for improving the soil. Some of the      most popular are barley, buckwheat, cow peas, millet,      winter rye, sorghum, common and yellow clovers, hairy vetch      any winter wheat. There are many more. To use them, you      simply spade, plow or otherwise stir your garden in late      summer or fall. Broadcast the seed by hand and rake it in.      Then stand back and watch your winter garden grow.    </p>    <p>      In the spring-when the crop is still young and      tender-turn it under with spade, plow or garden      tractor. Do this before the seeds develop, naturally,      unless you're trying to turn your garden into permanent      pasture.    </p>
