    <p>
                        <p>      For years I dreamed of a way to stay at home, be my own      boss . . . and earn enough to adequately support my family.      The several most unsatisfactory and unrewarding jobs I held      during that period of time did much to inspire my desire      for independence: I tried many forms of employment      and-having never been satisfied with any of them and      having never satisfied anyone else with them-I knew      there must be a better way. Work, for me, was becoming more      a "life sentence" than a job. However, in attempting to set      myself free, I only became more enslaved by systems and      people.    </p>    <p>      In my desperation, I considered all kinds of      self-employment from raising rabbits to raising cain! . . .      but the many "how to do" books didn't do for me. All the      advertised home businesses required too much money and many      of them-I later learned-were pure "con"      outfits.    </p>    <p>      To cut the moorings and launch out into the deep, I knew,      could only come through some original effort on my part.      Going against the tide and being an up-the-streamer would      cost . . . but the loss of my freedom was costing even      more. My life would have been different, I'm sure, if only      I had had the "herd instinct" . . . but when you can't join      the ranks of the rat race-or beat it      either-then you just have to be a lone rancher.    </p>    <p>      In 1961 I gave up teaching school (it was giving my ulcers      ulcers) and started working door to door as a Rawleigh      Products salesman. Although my parents thought this was a      disgrace for a man with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, I      enjoyed selling fairly well. At that time, it was the      living in the same house with my parents that was beginning      to really bug me. Since we were right in the center of town      my two little boys didn't have much yard to play in. I      wanted my own house as dearly as I wanted to be my own      boss. I was only one step from Clay County over these two      goals!    </p>    <p>      Then a nice lot just outside the city limits was offered      for sale. The price was $1250 and I didn't have the full      amount but I was determined to buy that lot and pay cash      for it. The property especially appealed to me because it      had no building code to worry about. Taking the money I had      on hand-and getting my mother to go on a bank note      for the balance-I purchased the lot and took      possession. I wasn't letting any grass grow under my feet.    </p>    <p>      Then came the major problem of building a house. A mortgage      was definitely out: We would build our own home somehow.      There would be a way if I had to make one out of no way.      Money, naturally, was still the number one mountain to      scale: I was paying off the note at the bank, making car      payments and doing my best to survive the money changers.    </p>    <p>      It was six months before we could start on the house.      Finally I had a man with proper tools lay off the      foundation and I dug ditches for the concrete footing.      Next, Solite blocks were ordered (along with some      reasonable brick masons) and we lifted the walls up to      floor level. Then . . . nothing happened on the little      house for many months. It's no sin to be poor: Just      terribly inconvenient!    </p>    <p>      At last my father-in-law presented us with a check for      $500.00 and the walls went up to the roof. I was      wonderfully blessed in locating some used, heart pine      lumber from an old house being torn down nearby and my      father-in-law, a friend and I used the wood for an A-roof.    </p>    <p>      A neighbor (who volunteered his services and wouldn't      accept any pay) and I wired the house for about $65.00 and      two men dug a well with a hand auger (see <strong>YOU CAN      DRIVE YOUR OWN WELL, MOTHER NO. 4) for $60.00.</strong> The      plumbing was the final hurdle and we solved that problem by      letting Montgomery Ward do the job for $715.00 payable over      the next two years.    </p>    <p>      On June 14, 1962 we borrowed my father-in-law's red Ford      truck and, with much excitement, moved into our new home.      The total cost was just a little over $3,000 and we paid      that off during the next three years by using notes at the      bank. There was never a mortgage on the property and there      never will be!    </p>    <p>      In passing, I'd like to point out that some      items-usually regarded as luxuries-can not only      be enjoyed on a limited budget . . . but can also go a long      way in helping to stretch that budget. We built a nice      fireplace into our house and the whole family loves the      open fire and finds it very relaxing. An added bonus, since      wood has always been freely available in our area, is the      good deal of money the fireplace has saved on our fuel      bill.    </p>    <p>      We soon found that-even with a house to our      good-we still hadn't quite mastered our own lives.      There always seemed to be urgent bills to pay and we were      constantly in need of some additional income. One day my      wife- Lou-feeling the money strain said, "I      wish there were something I could stay at home and do to      bring in a little extra money."    </p>    <p>      I seriously began to think about Lou's comment. I knew she      was very good at sewing and handwork and I had often heard      her say she wanted to learn to weave. Somehow, thinking      about Lou's artistic and creative yearnings, brought back      memories of my own desires as a child: I had always wanted      to learn to play the piano. At the time I wondered what      childhood longings could possibly have to do with the      problem at hand. A few months later I would see the      connection.    </p>    <p>      Once I had again started thinking about a piano, I couldn't      get it out of my mind and I asked the little wife what she      thought of my getting an old upright for $100.00. "NO!" she      said, "there's no room for a big, old piano in our small      living room." I knew she was right . . . but her refusal      still made me mad! And, lucky for us, my getting mad at      this point ignited a series of events that completely      revolutionized our lives.    </p>    <p>      "Ok," I thought, "if I can't have a piano, how about one of      those old-fashioned, parlor organs that you have to pedal      with your feet. It won't take up nearly as much space as a      piano."<br />    </p>    <p>      Once my wife had agreed to the organ idea I began a      three-month search for one. Finally, an old gentleman gave      me a tip that led me to an oak organ out in the country.      The owner sold it to me for just $5.00.    </p>    <p>      Again borrowing the red Ford truck, I brought the organ      home and placed it in the middle of the living room floor.      I was so excited I couldn't think about going to bed and,      late that night, I began to take it apart. I just had to      see what made it work!    </p>    <p>      At 4 o'clock the next morning everything was an oblong      blur, I was exhausted and I went to bed. Lou, rising early,      saw nothing but organ parts scattered all over the living      room. "He's ruined it," she said, "he'll never get it back      together again."    </p>    <p>      Well, it did take me quite a few months to restore that      organ, but only because I was learning the art of organ      rebuilding well.    </p>    <p>      I first refinished the case before tackling the bellows and      inside work. We had heard somebody say that household      ammonia would take the old varnish finish off antiques so I      got a half-gallon at the A & P for 35 cents . . . and      found it to be a cheap source of paint remover. I also      found that boiled linseed oil will darken wood and bleach      will lighten it; chewing tobacco makes a pretty good stain      and a beautiful stain can be made by putting green walnuts      in a gallon plastic container and pouring ammonia over      them.    </p>    <p>      As I was learning these tricks of the trade, friends and      neighbors-who saw how well the refinished organ      looked-kept asking us to do little refinishing jobs      for them. I began to see we could earn extra money with      antiques and refinishing and, besides, I really enjoyed      this work that could be done with very little equipment out      in the fresh air and sunshine.    </p>    <p>      To increase business, I decided to invest $3.85 for a ten      word ad in the classified section of the local newspaper.      We didn't have a telephone at that time so I gave my      mother's number and asked her to handle the calls for me.      She did and, much to my delight, the business began coming      in.    </p>    <p>      My wife had made me mad and started a career for me . . .      now it was my turn to start one for her.    </p>    <p>      One day an elderly man drove up with an oak chair to be      refinished. The chair's old cane bottom needed redoing and      he asked if we did that kind of work. "Oh yes," I said, "my      wife can do anything."    </p>    <p>      The man left the chair. I carried it in to Lou, set it down      and announced that she had to cane it. She announced right      back that she couldn't . . . and, furthermore, she wouldn't      cane it. So I reminded Lou of her earlier wish about making      money at home and realizing the opportunity-she      agreed to learn the ancient art of caning.    </p>    <p>      An antique dealer had given us a Home Demonstration Club      instruction sheet which Lou studied carefully. The seven      steps in caning were Greek to me but she seemed to      understand what it was all about. We ordered a hank of cane      and the first chair was begun and completed. We were in the      caning business.    </p>    <p>      Later, Lou took a rush chair, turned it upside down, looked      at it and started doing rush bottoms. An old craftsman      helped her master split bottoming.    </p>    <p>      When the message got around as to what we could do, we were      well on our way to doing it. My refinishing business picked      up and the boys, Jonathan and Joel, helped me with it.      Their mother taught them how to do caning and split bottoms      and they helped her too.    </p>    <p>      Our caning, rushing, refinishing and organ rebuilding had      now become well established so I decided to give up the      Rawleigh products and settle down to the new business at      home. I continued to run the newspaper ad from time to time      and it always seemed to work. Besides that, our patrons      were advertising for us and this word of mouth publicity      was really the most effective. Our business was generally      good but, sometimes in the year, we would have a slump. We      needed more exposure.    </p>    <p>      Realizing the power of television, I had a brain storm. I      wrote to the hostess of a local television show and offered      my services free in exchange for a chance to display my      organ work. She immediately phoned and extended an      invitation to appear.    </p>        <p>      A year or so later, I did the same thing with another TV      personality on a station in Durham, North Carolina. This      time the whole family was invited and we demonstrated our      various abilities. When we arrived back home we were      greeted by several long distance calls for information      about our work. Many of our friends considered us very      important to be invited on television. Little did they know      that I had engineered the whole thing!    </p>    <p>      Then another wonderful opportunity came to us. A distant      relative connected with a local Arts and Crafts Fair      invited us to participate in a show at the mall of a large      shopping center. This was just the exposure that could put      us on the map.    </p>    <p>      We were advised to have business cards to give to      passers-by so I went to a print shop and ordered a rubber      stamp made.    </p>    <p>      Words can't express what this little stamp did for our      business that first year in the fair. A card, stamped in      red ink (to make the information really stand out) proved      to be an eyecatcher and, after four years of giving away      cards at the show in the mall, we're getting business from      Washington, D.C., the eastern shore of Maryland and many      other Atlantic coast states.    </p>    <p>      Our primitive crafts have certainly come alive. To date, my      wife has done over a thousand chairs, I have rebuilt the      bellows of 158 organs . . . and they still keep coming.    </p>    <p>      Almost all we know about our skills is completely      self-taught. The home business-after five      years-appears to be well established. We're      completely out of debt and we hope to save a little money      at last. It's especially satisfying to feel our present      degree of independence. At times our work load even gets so      demanding that we have to turn down business: The telephone      rings so much some days that we're forced to take it off      the hook.    </p>    <p>      Little did we realize that our childhood dreams could do so      much for us. Not only did I learn to rebuild the Reed organ      but I was able to teach myself-with simple beginner      books-to play the instrument. I've now performed on      two television programs and played and spoke on the subject      to many women's clubs . . . all without ever having had a      professional lesson. In addition, the family now owns 24 of      these beautiful old antique organs which I mostly picked up      for five and ten dollars apiece.    </p>    <p>      One good thing just seems to lead to another. About a year      ago I started wood carving as a hobby. It all began because      of the organs. Many of them are hand carved with rosettes      and beautiful designs so I figured I could do simple      animals, letter openers and things like that. Then, last      Christmas, people started popping in and buying them and a      whole new business is opening up.    </p>    <p>      We've found our home business to be more than we ever      expected and it's wonderful to know that "we can't be fired      `cause we've never been hired." It took a lot of      self-discipline to make a way out of no way . . . yet and      still, we feel much more secure in our set-up than we ever      could with a job. If we get tired, we take a nap; when we      want to go fishing or camping, we go.    </p>    <p>      Of course, we can't say that our lot has been entirely a      bed of roses or a cross of sunshine. We've had some hard      days like many of our peers but I doubt we could stop our      way of life now if we wanted to. It's extremely satisfying      when visitors come long miles to see our organs and other      work. To be happy in one's work is the real test.    </p>    <p>      I've been able to give my family more of myself and my      philosophy of life during the past five years. When I was      teaching school and holding down a job I couldn't be      relaxed enough to really communicate with them. I can only      wonder what would have happened to my central nervous      system if I had stayed in the classroom chained to a system      which so many teachers-who love to teach-hate.    </p>    <p>      We've found such joy in our work and have been so honored      by it that we sincerely long to see others launch out into      the deep where the fishing is good. We're committed to      encouraging all arts and crafts around and about us.    </p>    <p>      If you're interested in learning caning just write to      Edward P. Demarest, P.O. Box 351, Sussex, N. J. 07461. He      will be glad to send you a free instruction sheet and      prices on caning materials. Your library is a fine source      for books on rush work and split-bottoming and the      librarian can order books on these subjects if necessary.    </p>    <p>      Refinishing can be done with very little equipment and      know-how. Experience is the best teacher and you'll pick up      many little tricks as you go along. I've found, for      instance, that box lye-cost, 25 cents a can-will make      a gallon of paint remover when mixed with water (always      neutralize with an application of vinegar to prevent damage      to the wood). I use this mixture to take five or more coats      of paint off old chairs.    </p>    <p>      A very practical refinishing solution can be made by      thinning shellac half-and-half with denatured alcohol. If      you wipe this solution into wood with an old nylon stocking      (a trick I learned from an antique dealer), you'll have a      beautiful hand-rubbed finish. Twenty coats can be put on a      chair in just an hour.    </p>    <p>      Your library can, again, be a good source of other      refinishing information.    </p>    <p>      If carving-the most ancient of all the      arts-interests you then just get a utility knife      (like they use in grocery stores to open cardboard boxes)      and start carving. I never buy any wood because there is      always an abundant free supply.<br />    </p>    <p>      You can carve letter openers from the slats on the ends of      grape crates. Melon boxes furnish enough wood for small      animals. I like to carve larger cats so I go to the mills      around here, get big crates and cut between the nails of      the 2 x 4's. Taking a piece of 2 X 4 six inches long, I      drill a hole in the top and proceed to carve out the cat.      The hole makes a holder for pens and pencils.    </p>    <p>      A very good income can be realized by visiting every trash      and dump pile you can find. In such places, I constantly      find valuable chairs, brassware, glassware, old iron items      and many, many other treasures.    </p>    <p>      I can't emphasize strongly enough the extra money we make      on things found at the city dump. Many of the antiques in      our house were picked up there. I once found a very      valuable round oak table in the dump . . . not to mention      an oak dresser, the oak case of a pipe organ, two ladder      back slipper chairs, an iron kettle, a pair of andirons and      some much soughtafter blue clamp-top canning jars. These      are only 1 few of my great finds. Many people will also      give you all the stuff in the attic if you'll just haul it      away. I've been in more attics than a thief.    </p>    <p>      On Sunday afternoons, the family goes out for a walk. We      observe wildlife, dig sassafras root and have a good time.      As we meander we pick up pop bottles, put them in a big      supermarket bag and bring them home.    </p>    <p>      The bottles are stored in crates (easily obtained from the      supermarket) and-every six months or so-I take      them to the bottling companies and collect the 2 cents      deposit. The take is usually about $10.00. That's $70.00 a      year for helping to clean up the landscape, keeping the      heart young and taking off extra pounds.    </p>    <p>      Two years ago we started gardening organically as real      "homesteaders". This summer we canned and froze over fifty      quarts of tomatoes and the freezer is full of corn; beans,      squash, pumpkins, okra and apples.    </p>    <p>      We're trying to learn everything there is to know about      living off the land and we're particularly interested in      free wild foods and preserving by sun drying. We're simple      people, wanting the simple life.    </p>    <p>      I've had the most fun telling "you all" about our home      business and way of life. As a matter of fact-since      starting our work here-I've thought of several other      home occupations but I'll save those for another time.    </p>    <p>      For now, do write and let me know what you're up to. I like      to get mail (it makes me feel important). And the welcome      mat is always out: When you're down this way, do stop by.
