                    <h5 id="byline">      by GRACE V. SCHILLINGER     </h5>    <p>      If you'd like to try preserving beans in an old-time,      way-down-south way, here's how to do it:    </p>    <p>      Pick your green or wax beans when they're tender and      "snappy." Wash them and snip off the stem end. The other      little sharp pointed tip won't matter, so leave it on. Let      the beans drain until fairly dry, or at least till the      water has dripped off.    </p>    <p>      Take a large darning needle and thread it with white store      string. Kite string will do fine. Then thread your beans on      the cord, sticking the needle through the middle of each      bean. I don't mean down the center of the bean, just      <em>through</em> the center, so both ends of the bean are      loose.    </p>    <p>      Fasten the first bean by wrapping the string around it and      making a knot so it won't pull through. Then go on      stringing till your string's full. Fasten the last bean the      same as the first one.    </p>    <p>      Dry the beans by hanging on a wire in a clean, dry place.      An attic or unused room would be okay. Or hang them in your      kitchen. They'll be <em>gab grabbers,</em> for sure! In the      most high fallutin' magazines you'll see how decorators      festoon rooms with the most unusual items. All      right-go ahead with your leather britches!    </p>    <p>      The beans will become dry and wrinkled and you'll wonder      what in the world you'll ever do with them, besides just      letting them swing there.    </p>    <p>      In winter, take your dried beans down-several strings      for a large kettle-and remove the strings. Rinse      well, then put on to cook. When they boil up once, pour off      the first water so you know they're clean and to remove any      bitter taste. Then pour in fresh water, toss in a ham bone      and an onion to keep the beans company and salt and pepper      to taste. Cook till tender.    </p>    <p>      You'll come up with a mighty fine cold weather dish that'll      stick to your ribs. These beans will remind you of long-ago      years when folks <em>had</em> to preserve much of their      food by drying.    </p>    <p>      Happy eating!    </p>
