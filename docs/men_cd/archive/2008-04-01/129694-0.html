        <p>You can propagate your mums, phlox and other perennials in the spring by taking 3-inch cuttings from the new growth. Strip the leaves from the bottom 2 inches of the cuttings, then plant the cutting and cover it loosely with a handful of mulch to shade it. Keep the soil moist. In a few weeks you will see new growth.</p>
