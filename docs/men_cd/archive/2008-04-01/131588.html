And whether you want to have more deductions next year or just want to feel good about where your money goes, giving to charities is an easy and fulfilling way to make a difference. <a title="Charity Navigator" href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/" target="_blank">Charity Navigator</a> provides a list of nonprofit groups from around the world.
