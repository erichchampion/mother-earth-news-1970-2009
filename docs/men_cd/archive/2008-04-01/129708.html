        <p>When it comes to good books on kitchen gardening, readers in warm climates have too often been left out in the cold. It is for this reason that <em>The Southern Kitchen Garden</em>, by William D. Adams and Thomas R. Leroy (Taylor Trade Publishing), will be as welcome a proposition to southern gardeners as a cool glass of lemonade on a steamy August day.</p><p>The book provides useful planting guides for all the vegetables, fruits and herbs the typical southern kitchen gardener could want, including average spring and fall freeze dates for the 60 largest southern cities.</p><p>The authors have produced a solid book with a message that bears repeating: While kitchen gardening may be a universal language spoken in all parts of the world, it’s a language with many unique dialects and ac cents, including a charming southern drawl. </p>
