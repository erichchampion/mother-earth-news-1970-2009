                        <p>      What's in a name? Or, in this case, a label? If you buy      foods that say "organic," chances are that they not only      contain modified or irradiated ingredients, but that some      of those ingredients may have been produced using hormones,      antibiotics, and synthetic or sludge fertilizers. Seeking      to consolidate the current patchwork of "organic" and      "natural" labels on foods, the U.S. Department of      Agriculture (USDA) has proposed a national standard that      will regulate the production and processing of organic      foods and ingredients.    </p>    <p>      Presently, products marketed as "organic" are certified by      numerous state and private agencies, thereby creating      domestic consumer confusion and complicating the export of      products. But under the USDAs new proposal, which      Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman called "the most      comprehensive and strongest organic standard in the world,"      all crops, livestock and processed foods that want to      include "organic" on their labels will have to be produced      under uniform guidelines governing the methods, substances      and handling that go into their production. Three      controversial processes in particular - the use of      genetically modified ingredients, the use of radiation to      decontaminate, and the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer -      are specifically prohibited under the new labeling      criteria.    </p>    <p>      The USDA'S attempt to regulate this fast-growing sector of      American agriculture suggests that the agency can no longer      ignore consumer demand estimated retail sales of organic      foods in 1999 were nearly $6 billion) nor the growing      community of organic farmers, many of whom are small-scale      producers. In the past, many USDA policies were criticized      for discriminating against both consumers and small      farmers. In a recent press release, however, the USDA      confidently claims that its new standard is "exactly what      American consumers and organic farmers want," and the      department announced additional measures to promote organic      agriculture, including a trial, risk-management insurance      program to aid the organic farming community.    </p>    <p>      But will stringent federal regulations encourage      small-scale organic farming? Katherine DiMatteo, the      Organic Trade Association's executive director, thinks the      rules could hinder rather than help. "Some of the      requirements may prove to be a challenge to the industry      particularly for Smaller operations," she said in a public      statement. "For instance, will the supply of approved      materials be sufficient to allow production of the organic      products consumers clamor for?"    </p>    <p>      The genetically modified foods controversy, ("Brave New      Food", MOTHER, April/May 2000), is a touchy subject where      science, social values and commerce clash, causing both      consumer suspicion and trade blockades. As a precursor to      more recent protests, organic producers, concerned      consumers and environmentalists rallied against the USDA's      1997 proposal, arguing that its standards not only      threatened the good name of "organic," but also allowed big      agribusinesses to compete in the burgeoning organic market      by blurring the lines between nonorganic and organic      production methods. Now, nearly three years later, those      protests are being accounted for in the USDA's new      standards. And while the implications of these regulations      for organic farmers remain to be seen - the proposal could      go into effect as early as the end of this year - the      victory for consumers is clear: "Organic," under any other      label other than "USDA Certified," simply wouldn't be      organic.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Erin Torneo</em>    </p>
