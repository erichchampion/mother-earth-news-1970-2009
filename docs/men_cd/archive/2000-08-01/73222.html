                            <p>      "I was fascinated, drawn to them," she recalls.    </p>    <p>      Shortly after moving to the place where lambs beckoned her,      Child obtained seven or eight Suffolk-based ewes. The sheep      produced sparse, white, medium-weight wool, typical of      mutton-type breeds in the region. It wasn't quite what      Child had in mind.    </p>        <p>      Mary Child "skirts", or removes, less desirable wool from      the edges of a recently sheared fleece.    </p>    <p>      Determined to produce dense, soft, naturally colored      fleeces, she added to her flock a black, mostly Corriedale      ram and a purebred Lincoln ram to improve the wool on      future lambs.    </p>    <p>      Corriedales produce a soft, dense, medium-long fleece with      a medium-tight crimp grading in the mid-50s (see " Wool      Grades "). Lincoln fleeces yield a lustrous, extremely      durable, long-staple fiber, great for specialty items such      as socks or carpets.    </p>    <p>      Although Lincoln wool grades only in the low 40s,      handspinners generally favor it over 50-grade Suffolk wool,      which can be harsh or brittle and tends to handle poorly.    </p>    <p>      "Lincoln adds luster and strength to Corriedale wool,"      advises Child, who today shares six acres with 14 ewes and      four rains. In a drier, less fertile area, six acres might      limit her to a flock of six or less animals. In a more lush      area, or with intensive rotational grazing, she might      pasture 25 to 30 sheep. In all cases, well-drained sloping      land reduces hoof and worm problems, and is an important      first step in keeping a healthy herd.    </p>        <h3>      Healthy Sheep, Healthy Wool    </h3>    <p>      In general, sheep thrive on good quality pasture or hay,      clean water and a sheep mineral salt. Mineral salt intended      for cattle contains more copper than sheep usually need and      can be toxic. Most sheep minerals contain higher levels of      selenium, which is necessary to metabolize vitamin E, and      prevent serious muscle-related diseases.    </p>    <p>      Sheep that graze on pasture with selenium - deficient soil      are prone to prolapse (of uteruses or rectums) and may      produce stillborn or weak lambs with poor lung capacity. In      some regions, feeding miner also containing even the      maximum legal level of selenium isn't enough. Supplements      of selenium/vitamin E are available from your veterinarian,      but be sure not to overdo it. Too much selenium can have      the same effect as too little.    </p>		      <p>      Sheep love alfalfa... too much. If suddenly given free      access, they'll gorge and possibly die from bloating. Some      shepherds graze alfalfa, but most store it for winter as a      high-protein (about 17%) hay. Corn provides great energy,      but is only about 8% protein. Corn-based feeds sold in      100-pound sacks at farm stores incorporate soybean meal      (about 42% protein) and other protein-rich ingredients.      Sheep do well on 10% to 12% protein; lambs need more. In      cold weather and late pregnancy, ewes need extra energy.      High-quality pasture or hay normally provides adequate      energy and protein. Ewes carrying twins or triplets often      run out of rumen room for hay and may need grain to      supplement their diet.    </p>    <p>      Although diet and genes determine basic wool quality,      trauma can severely affect it. Sudden changes in feed,      routine, surroundings, a caretaker or flock members can      cause stress, which in turn can cause a wool "break."      Breaks, or weak points, in a fleece mark traumatic events      as clearly as rings mark the age of a tree.    </p>        <p>      At left, a small barn with built-in feeders and solid sides      facing prevailing winds provides adequate protection for      Child's sheep. The open sides reduce moisture buildup and      ammonia fumes, which can cause problems in more tightly      sealed structures.    </p>    <p>      To protect the value of her wool, Child avoids stressing      her sheep. "You don't take them off a low-protein diet and      suddenly put them on a high-protein diet." While a bag of      sheep feed may provide the same nutrition as      alfalfa/orchard grass hay, you can't abruptly substitute      one for the other without disrupting the animal's      digestion.    </p>    <p>      Child also guards her investment against external threats      like harsh weather and debris. Sheep unwittingly collect in      their fleeces sandy soil, burdock, briars, hay and more.      This dirt and vegetable matter must be removed, and tangled      fibers must be straightened before wool can be spun. To      accomplish this, commercial processors mechanically scour      and card wool.    </p>    <p>      D one by hand, it's quite a job. Thus handspinners,      particularly those who like to spin "in the grease"      (preferring the rich lanolin of unwashed wool), will pay      top dollar for a quality fleece in prime, clean condition.    </p>    <p>      Child's answer? Jackets.    </p>    <p>      Available in canvas, plastic or plastic-coated fabric,      jackets (also called sheepcovers) keep sheep clean and may      help to guard against the sun's ultraviolet rays, thereby      reducing fading at the tips of colored wool.    </p>    <p>      About the only minor downside to jackets is that they can      rub the fleece and cause it to become slightly tippy, with      fiber ends twisted together or matted. The easy solution is      "flick carding," a quick action with a carding comb over      the fleece's surface that unlocks and straightens tips.    </p>    <p>      Shepherds report that wool grows more under jackets, and      studies done at the University of Wyoming support this      idea.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wool</strong> <strong>Glossary</strong>    </p>    <p>      BREAK: weak points in a fleece caused by trauma CARD:      wire-toothed device used to untangle wool COARSE: wool with      larger diameter fibers, generally scratchy to touch<br />      CRIMP: Wave or natural zigzag of wool fiber that allows      itto stretch and    </p>    <p>      spring back. Combing or carding wool stretches the crimp.      Water triggers crimp "memory" and makes it spring back.

That sweet fur ball sitting at your feet can transformgiven      access and opportunity - into a stealthy sheep slayer.    </p>    <p>      "Not my doggie," you say? That's what I thought when a      warden informed me that my dog had tried to kill a      neighbor's sheep. "That's several miles away," I insisted,      "and besides, Laddie has never bothered my herd." True as      that was, it turned out that Laddie was guilty as charged.      To protect neighboring flocks, I've taken to confining him      at night and whenever we're gone from home.    </p>    <p>      Unlike bears and coyotes seeking easy meals, dogs kill      sheep for fun. Until you've witnessed it firsthand, it's      hard to fathom the carnage they can cause. I won't soon      forget the evening that thundering sheep hooves and loud      bleating prompted my husband to fire a shotgun into the      air. The dogs-all pets-never barked but moved to the next      farm, where, the following morning, I saw the aftermath: 42      dead or dying ewes. Only two members of the flock had      escaped unscathed.    </p>    <p>      Next to you, the best protector for your sheep is,      ironically, a dog. Not a pet, but a working guard dog such      as a Maremma or Great Pyrenees (for more on selecting a      working breed dog, see " The Homestead Hound "). Raised      with your sheep from puppyhood, a guard dog will bond with      and defend the flock against straying pet dogs. Guard dogs      (and/or llamas and donkeys) can also be used to protect      flocks from coyotes and bears where these wild predators      are a problem.    </p>        <p>      Hootie-Crow, Child's working Border collie, fetches the      ewes from the barn on shearing day.    </p>    <h3>      To Shear a Sheep    </h3>    <p>      It's an early spring morning and Sarah Beamer, a      professional shearer, has arrived at Child's homestead      ready for work. Child commands Hootie-Crow, her working      Border collie, to fetch the ewes in one barn and bring them      to another, where there's electricity to power Beamer's      shearing machine - a high-volume tool with a clipper head      at the end of a long, flexible arm connected to a      freestanding motor. Like most professionals, Bearner      prefers this type of shearer to the self-contained units      that resemble electric barber clippers. "The handheld units      are okay for your own small flock, but with the motor in      the unit, they get hot and are heavy," explains Beamer.    </p>    <p>      Equipped with the right cutters, the shearer's remaining      needs are simple: someone to bring in sheep one at a time;      a level surface free of hay; and dry animals that haven't      eaten for several hours. "You can't shear sheep if they're      wet," says Beamer, "and it makes them uncomfortable when      you set them up and their stomachs are full."    </p>        <p>      Attached to the right clipper head, this 13-tooth, flared      comb is the ideal tool for shearing fine wool.    </p>    <p>      How do you locate good shearers and what can you expect to      pay? Ask someone who owns sheep and be prepared to describe      yours. While most professionals charge per head, the amount      can vary tremendously, depending on your location, number      of sheep and wool type. A shearer wanting $2 a head for      zipping through 100 five-pound Suffolk fleeces in eight      hours may not have the correct cutter combs or patience to      remove 15-pound fine wool fleeces without "second cuts" -      even if you triple her normal charge. (Second cuts, a      handspinner's curse, occur when a shearer goes back over an      area after the original stroke. The resulting short fibers      make wool fuzzy" and very difficult to spin.)    </p>    <p>      Most sheep are sheared in the spring, but not all. Some are      sheared before lambing. Wool-less sheep seek shelter more      quickly on cold, wet days, taking the lambs with them.      Plus, lambs easily find their sheared mama's teats.    </p>    <p>      Most wool grows four to six inches a year, a desirable      fiber length. Leaving wool long through summer can add to      insect and maggot problems.    </p>    <p>      While it may be tempting to save a dollar and shear your      own sheep, be warned: Shearing is a complex,      laborintensive, backbreaking skill that sends most wool      growers scrambling for a good position on a professional      shearer's docket. Picture yourself catching a 170-pound ewe      and convincing her to hold still while you remove her      winter coat with a quick-moving sharp object. It's      certainly possible to shear sheep with hand-powered      shearing scissors, but whether you'll come away with solid,      usable fleeces is another matter. And one snipping slip can      injure the shepherd or kill the sheep.    </p>    <p>      It may be best to limit your cutting to the "skirting"      table, where you'll cull, or skirt, the short wool from      around your fleeces' edges. Belly and leg wool scraps can      be used for quilt batting or turned into felt. The      remaining fleece, comprised of back and some neck wool,      contains the longest, finest and most valuable fiber.    </p>        <h3>      Goin' to Market    </h3>    <p>      All wool sells in the grease, unless a shepherd decides to      add value by producing a product such as roving or felt.    </p>    <p>      Handspinners will pay $6 to $12 per pound for prime raw      fleeces, with natural colored wools commanding higher      prices than white. This is quite the opposite of the      commercial bulk market, where easily dyeable white wool is      preferred and purchased in tightly packed, 200-pound sacks.      Bulk wool produced in the U.S. generally comes from      well-muscled, quickgrowing market lambs raised for meat      rather than wool quality.    </p>    <p>      If wool (and not meat) is to be your primary aim, you'll      want to concentrate your efforts on producing the quality      fleeces handspinners favor. Finding buyers is largely a      matter of getting the word out. Once you earn a reputation      for providing quality wool, handspinners will return for      your fleeces year after year. Many growers sell their wool      on the Internet or at festivals. At one time Chill      participated in wool and fiber shows to market her fleeces,      but in recent years customers like Barbara Gentry have come      to her.    </p>        <p>      Gentry keeps 30 American Cormo sheep. She spins, weaves,      knits and dyes wool, while teaching others how to do the      same at her on-farm shop, Stony Mountain Fibers, in      Charlottesville, Virginia.    </p>    <p>      Why does Gentry occasionally buy a fleece from Child if she      has her own? Cormo wool, with a four- to five-inch staple,      a 58-to 60-fiber count and a tight crimp, is white. Child's      fleeces range from cream to pale pewter to silver to black      to chocolate to variegated. Plus, notes Gentry, "Mary's      fleeces are very healthy, with no breaks."    </p>    <p>      Unless you sell your fleeces straight off the sheep's back,      you'll likely have to store them for a bit. You can keep      wool in any porous material, including woven plastic or      paper, but be sure it is sealed against or kept away from      moths and bees. Bees love to nest in wool and moths lay      eggs in it so larvae have plenty to eat.    </p>    <h3>      Selecting a Breed    </h3>    <p>      Different sheep breeds not only produce different wool, but      exhibit different levels of feed efficiency, disease      resistance, hardiness, longevity, milk production and      flocking instinct. Breeds also display distinct      personalities.    </p>    <p>      Which should you choose? First, read about sheep husbandry,      breeds and their traits, then visit some sheep, talk to      shepherds and go to a fiber festival or wool show. Before      sheep shopping, think carefully about what's important to      you. If a good temperament is what you want, try Southdown      sheep, whose tempers match their gentle soft gray faces.      They're excellent mothers but are also the smallest breed,      produce the least amount of wool and don't tolerate heat.      Romneys and Lincolns display even tempers, but Romneys are      decidedly average in other ways and Lincolns tend toward      the less hardy. Merinos produce huge quantities of very      fine wool and are great mothers, but you'd better know how      to handle sheep before you try to maneuver them!    </p>    <p>      I have been raising sheep in Blue Grass, Virginia, for the      better part of 25 years. For 15 years, like farmers around      me, I ignored wool and concentrated on market lambs. Ten      years ago, I looked at the wool, screamed, and bought a      Rambouillet ram. Today, my 60 or so sheep are a complex      cross of Suffolks and Rambouillets with piebald genetics.      They look like Holstein cows with white wool.    </p>    <p>      Suffolks milk well, are prolific and grow quickly, but tend      to be short-lived, not particularly hardy and an      embarrassment to wool. Rambouillets added fine, dense wool      and extended the useful life of my ewes from six or seven      years to 10 or 11 years. Hybrid vigor can make the total      package better than the sum of its parts.    </p>    <p>      Recently I've been breeding my piebald rams with totally      unrelated piebald ewes to produce consistent      halfSuffolk/halfRambouillet lambs. Detailed records, both      on paper and on the sheep (as numbered and color-coded ear      tags) make it possible.    </p>    <p>      Note that to produce solid, dark wool, sheep must carry two      recessive genes for color-black/gray or brown-and will      appear black unless both genes code for brown. Sheep that      appear white may harbor a single recessive black or brown      gene and not be "pure" white at all.    </p>    <h3>      Starting a Flock    </h3>    <p>      To locate sources for a particular breed, contact the      breed's purebred association or look in sheep publications      (see " Sources "). Many breeders list sheep for sale on the      Web. If you want a few sheep for wool and don't want to      raise lambs, wethers (castrated rams) may suit you. You may      also find crossbred sheep fit your needs.    </p>    <p>      Before purchasing sheep, check udders for lumps (a sign of      mastitis); scrotums for large solid symmetrical testicles      (indicates good health and fertility); feet for trimmed      hooves (either the result of great care or foot rot); and      teeth for age (one set of adult teeth comes in annually      until a sheep is four years old; after age four, teeth      begin to wear down). If you fail to see front teeth on the      upper jaw, don't think a sheep has lost them; it never had      any.    </p>    <p>      Although livestock markets auction sheep, purchasing them      in this way carries a two-prong risk. First, someone else      wanted to get rid of them - you should ask why. Second,      when you bring an animal home from a livestock market, it      can bring diseases it may have caught from the other      animals at the show.    </p>        <p>      Barbara Gentry, shepherd and spinner, weaves a wool rug on      a drugget, or barn loom.    </p>    <p>      Some shepherds start a flock with orphan lambs. Farmers      with large flocks commonly give away or sell "extra"      newborn lambs, particularly triplets from mothers with only      enough milk for two. These orphans - also called "pet" or      "hammer" lambs - must be bottle-fed small amounts of milk      every four hours, night and day, until they can digest more      food less often. Large-scale farmers don't have enough time      to act as a surrogate mother and help 100 ewes have 150 to      200 lambs in two weeks.    </p>    <p>      Pet lambs get very tame and attached to whoever feeds them.      "Stepmothers" can hardly walk though a field without      tripping over adoring pets. As adults, the 130- to      225-pound ewes can unintentionally knock their object of      affection (you) flat on the ground. If, on the other hand,      a 150- to 300-pound "pet" ram knocks you down, it's no      accident. He wants to be the boss. Not all rams are      aggressive, but never turn your back on one-not even one      named "Sweetiekins."    </p>    <p>      I recommend keeping a minimum of two or three sheep (a few      good wool producers will provide enough fiber for all the      sweaters you can use, plus stuffing for a quilt or two).      Keep more sheep and you'll have more wool to sell. Keep a      lone sheep and it will end up inside your house, perhaps      sleeping behind the stove with the cat. Remember, these are      social animals. If you don't give them a flock, they'll      find one.    </p>    <p>      Read more about livestock and HOMESTEADING.      <strong>www.motherearthnews.com</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOURCES<br /></strong><br />      <strong>BOOKS<br /></strong> <em>Raising Sheep the Modern      Way</em> (1989);<br />      <em>Spinning and Weaving with Wool</em> (1991); <em>Turning      Wool into a Cottage Industry</em> (1991) <em>,</em> all by      Paula Simmons, Storey Books, Pownal, VT<br />      <br />      <em>Complete Herbal Handbook for Farm and Stable,</em> by      Juliette De Bairacli-Levy, Faber & Faber,      <em>1991.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Veterinary Book for Sheep Farmers,</em> by David C.
