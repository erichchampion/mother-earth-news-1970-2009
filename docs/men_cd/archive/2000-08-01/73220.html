                    <h5 id="byline">      by ROBERT ANDERSON    </h5>    <h3>      LIGHTNING    </h3>    <p>      It is estimated that 100,000 thunderstorms occur each year      in the United States, and that approximately 10% of those      can be classified as severe. The National Weather Service      classifies a thunderstorm as severe if it produces hail      3/4-inch in diameter and winds of 58 mph or greater.    </p>    <p>      Thunderstorms can occur at anytime of the day or night and      at anytime of the year, however most occur in the afternoon      or evening hours of spring and summer months... and all      produce lightning. Lightning kills about 90 people and      injures nearly 300 each year. It is generally classified as      high or low voltage and high or low amperage. The low-power      lightning bolts are also known as hot lightning bolts. They      have low voltage but high amperage and a relatively long      duration (about 1/10th of a second). This combination bolt      produces tremendous heat and can reach temperatures of      50,000Â°F (hotter than the sun). Cold lightning, on the      other hand, is high voltage, low amperage and has      geometrically greater power. Cold bolts can have up to ten      times the voltage of hot lightning, but they last only      about 1/10,000th of a second. They are often responsible      for massive destruction.    </p>    <p>      WHAT TO DO: If you can hear thunder, you are close enough      to be struck by lightning. If possible, get inside a sturdy      building. Such areas as sheds, tents, cars and under      isolated trees are not acceptable. If a hard top automobile      is your only option, roll up the windows and do not touch      any metal surfaces. Contraryto generations of dangerously      misguided lore, the rubber tires of autos do not offer full      protection, as the steel frame can transmit electrical      energy. You may still be injured in the vehicle, but much      less so than if you were outside. If you are involved in      watersports, get to land, get out of the boat and away from      the water. Do not shower or bathe. Use telephones only for      emergencies, unplug any appliances, turn off air      conditioners. If you are outside and remote from any safe      shelter, find a low area that is not subject to flash      flooding and is away from trees, fences, poles, etc. If you      are in wooded areas, seek shelter under the shorter trees.      If at any point you feel your hair stand on end or your      skin tingle, you must immediately make yourself the      smallest target possible. Squat low to the ground on the      balls of your feet, place your head between your knees and      put your hands on your knees. Minimize any contact with the      ground.    </p>    <h3>      TORNADOES    </h3>    <p>      The most violent storms in the world cause an average of 82      deaths in the U.S. annually. Tornadoes can occur at anytime      of the year, but in the Southern states they tend to occur      in the spring (summer in the North). Most tornado deaths      occur while people are in autos or mobile homes.    </p>    <p>      WHAT TO DO: A tornado warning indicates a need to take      shelter immediately (not to be confused with the less      severe "watch"). If you are at home or in a small building,      go to the basement or to an interior room of the lowest      floor. If possible, take cover under a large immovable      object such as a workbench. Wrap yourself in heavy blankets      or coats to protect from flying debris, and put on any      motorcycle or bicycle helmets. If you are in a large public      building, stay away from glass-enclosed areas or areas with      a wide roof span, such as gymnasiums or auditoriums and      warehouses. Crouch down, roll into a ball and cover your      head with your hands. This position protects most vital      organ areas. If you are in a car or a mobile home, abandon      them immediately, go to a sturdy structure or a designated      tornado shelter. If there is no suitable structure nearby,      lie flat in the nearest ditch or depression in the ground      and cover your head with your hands.    </p>    <h3>      HURRICANES    </h3>    <p>      Hurricanes are tropical cyclones in which winds reach a      constant speed of 74 mph or greater. The visual hallmark of      these storms is a tightening spiral around an area of      extreme low pressure. The winds flow in a counterclockwise      direction in the Northern Hemisphere (clockwise in the      Southern). Near the center of the storm, winds can exceed      200 mph. An "eye of the storm" is unique to hurricanes, and      this calm center, with mild winds and clear skies, can last      half an hour or longer. An important thing to remember is      that on the far side, the winds blow in the opposite      direction and are at the storm's maximum strength. Initial      forward speed of a hurricane can be as little as 15 mph,      but the farther it gets from the equator the faster its      forward speed becomes.    </p>    <p>      Drowning is the major cause of hurricane deaths. As the      storm strikes a coastline, it brings huge waves and tidal      storm surges that can reach 25 feet above normal tide      lines, while torrential rains cause inland flooding. The      Atlantic hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30.    </p>    <p>      WHAT TO DO: Hurricanes can rapidly change in intensity,      course and speed, so keeping a vigil over the radio for      current storm information is absolutely critical. Clear      your yard of any loose debris and anything that can be      blown about and cause damage. Take the time to fill your      vehicle with gas and any supplies you might need upon      evacuation. An important item to keep on hand is a road      map; if all major roads are impassable, either closed or      clogged, you may need to take alternate routes. Also have      on hand plywood, nails, and any other materials needed to      board up windows and shutters.    </p>    <h3>      FLASH FLOODING    </h3>    <p>      Flash floods are the number one weather related killer in      the U.S. each year, resulting in approximately 140 deaths.      Most fatalities occur at night when people become trapped      in automobiles. Hikers trapped in canyons with no means of      escape are also at high risk. Water one foot deep can      displace 1,500 pounds - enough force to sweep away an      automobile.    </p>    <p>      WHAT TO DO: If you are inside of a building and are ordered      to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive through a      flooded area. Even though it looks passable, the roadway      may not be intact or stable. If you are caught outside away      from safe shelter, immediately seek higher ground. Avoid      canyons, dry riverbeds, streams, creeks and rivers. Keep      children away from culverts, drainage ditches or storm      drains.    </p>    <h3>      EXCESSIVE HEAT    </h3>    <p>      Although not a "storm," excessive heat conditions can have      a devastating effect, particularly in congested urban      areas. Heat cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke are      life-threatening.    </p>    <p>      WHAT TO DO: Cramps are simply muscles contracting due to      excessive water loss through perspiration. Gently massage      the muscles, sit in a cool place and drink plenty of      fluids. Heat exhaustion is manifested in profuse      perspiration, cool and clammy skin, a weak pulse, possible      fainting and nausea or vomiting. If left untreated,      exhaustion can lead to heat stroke. Have the exhausted      person lie down in a cool place, loosen any restrictive      clothing and place cool washcloths over pulse points      (wrists, neck, head) to help the body cool off. Drink cool      water. If the person is vomiting and unable to keep down      fluids, seek medical help. Heatstroke causes the body's      heat regulatory system to fail, thereby rendering it unable      to produce perspiration. Death can occur very rapidly after      initial onset of symptoms. Lookfor hot, dry skin,      confusion, irrational behavior, coma, seizures, and a very      rapid pulse. If the heatstroke is induced by heavy      exertion, the person may still have perspiration on his or      her skin while being unable to produce more. Take the      victim to a cool place, remove clothing, sponge with cool      water, fan him or her and call 911. Do not give fluids by      mouth.    </p>    <h3>      ASSEMBLE A DISASTER SUPPLY KIT    </h3>    <p>      Small kits (the list below is for a larger one) should be      kept in a family's vehicles at all times. Depending on      where you live, pack the kit for at least 12 hours of      survival. If you live in or are traveling to remote areas,      plan the kit to lastthree days or longer.    </p>    <p>      Have your family trained in basic safety measures, such as      CPR, and basic first aid. Quiz your gas company on when and      how to turn off the supply to the house, and ask the same      question of the local water service and the electric      company. Designate a meeting place outside of the home      where your family will meet in an emergency.<br />    </p>    <p>      DISASTER KIT    </p>    <p>      <em>(Suggested: all kits should be personalized)<br /></em>    </p>
