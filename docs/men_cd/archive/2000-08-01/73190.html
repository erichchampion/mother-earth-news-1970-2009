                        <p>      I read in your May 2000 issue about using ground cinnamon      to repel ants ("Ant flavoring," Country Lore) and thought      I'd pass along my natural technique. In the summer months,      we leave our back door ajar while we are going in and out      and to and from the garden. In doing this, I have noticed      that the ants take full advantage of our open-door policy.      To prevent them from finding our open door appealing, I      have pulled a handful of spearmint from the herb garden and      laid it across the doorway when the door is open. The      strong scent confuses them and masks other, more inviting      odors. In addition, I read or heard somewhere that ants lay      out scented paths to food sources so that other ants can      get in on the bounty. The strong spearmint scent masks this      trail. We inherited a patch of spearmint in the garden from      the previous owners, and I have found that it is quite      invasive. So pulling up large quantities of it for this use      is not a problem. By using it for its repelling quality      each day, and then tossing the wilted sprigs into the      compost when I'm done gardening for the day, I have kept      the spearmint patch manageable and useful. I imagine other      strongly scented herbs and spices would work in that way.    </p>    <p>      <em>M. Leanbart<br /></em> <em>Iowa City, IA</em>    </p>
