                    <p>      <strong>Uncover the players, the power and the<br />      possibilities of renewable energy.<br /></strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Lisa Cohn    </h5>            <p>      <strong>Large-scale solar energy facility in Daggett,      California.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Across the United States, buyers may now purchase "clean"      kilowatt-hours from wind turbines perched atop ridges in      Wyoming and Colorado, solar panels that cap parking      structures in California, or geothermal power plants that      harvest 500-degree underground temperatures.    </p>    <p>      According to the American Wind Energy Association in      Washington, D.C., more than 140 utilities in the U.S. are      now offering "green" power from renewable energy sources,      while some unregulated energy companies are already      operating in some states. Just look for power labels like      Blue Sky, Wind for the Future and Salmon-Friendly Power,      whose names are intended to evoke images of pure air,      waste-free water, and rivers that nurture fish and      wildlife.    </p>    <h3>      LET'S MAKE A DEAL    </h3>    <p>      Paul Komor, research director for E Source, a private      energy information provider in Boulder, Colorado, says that      the good news about the fledgling green power industry is      that renewable energy is being developed all over the      country. "Buying green power is the single best thing you      can do with your money to help the environment," he adds.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, buyers may feel they need advanced degrees in      environmental studies and economics to wade through an      energy company's befuddling list of electricity      alternatives, energy mixtures, pricing terms and sometime      questionable claims about which kinds of power are truly      "clean."    </p>    <p>      In fact, Kirk Brown, assistant director of San Francisco's      Center For Resource Solutions (CRS), one of a handful of      organizations that "certify", or guarantee, that clean      power is truly clean through meeting given environmental      standards, says that blindly choosing any kind of green      power program isn't the best thing to do. "A green power      program may not be delivering any renewable energy," he      says. "That's the tricky issue."    </p>    <p>      Just look at GreenMountain.com , which is based in South      Burlington, Vermont, and is the largest green power      marketer in the United States. They offer a product that      includes renewable energy mixed in with more conventional      sources of power in an effort to keep the price down.      However, others do sell 100% renewable energy while      offering to build new clean power plants in the process.      The cost may be higher for the individual, though much      lower for the environment. For a price about 80% higher per      unit of energy than electricity from traditional sources,      PacifiCorp in Portland, Oregon, says it will build new wind      turbines to provide customers with 100% renewable energy.    </p>    <p>      That said, pricing terms vary from one company to another.      Some sellers offer green energy in "blocks," others in      kilowatt-hours, still others for a monthly fee. In general,      green power costs 10% to 30% more than conventional sources      of electricity.    </p>    <p>      To further confuse buyers, companies haven't been      completely honest about the sources of their power. In a      test program in the mid-1990s, Northeast Utilities in      Berlin, Connecticut, claimed that its environmentally      friendly energy was harnessed with the force of water. They      failed to mention that nuclear- and fossil fuel-fired      plants provided some of the muscle to move the water.    </p>    <p>      "If you say it's green, it ought to be deep forest green,      not lime green or aqua," says Angus Duncan, president of      the Bonneville Environmental Foundation in Portland,      Oregon. "Consumers need to comprehend where the      kilowatt-hours come from before color-coding their      electricity."    </p>    <h3>      POWER SOURCES    </h3>        <p>      <strong>Geothermal water coolers in Pahoa, Hawaii.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Electricity flows to consumers from a large pool that      includes power from a variety of different sources. In the      Northwest, for example, some of the energy comes from      utility-owned facilities that feed pulverized coal into      steam boilers that produce electricity. The utilities      transfer the power onto 345,000-volt transmission lines,      where it becomes part of the regional pool of electricity.      Says Duncan: "We sit with our straws and suck electricity      out of that pool."    </p>    <p>      The real problem, however, is that about 56% of electricity      in the U.S. is generated by coal-fired plants that produce      the world's most notorious greenhouse gas: carbon dioxide.      According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC),      global concentrations of carbon dioxide have increased by      about 30% over the last century.    </p>    <p>      Much of the rest of the electricity mix comes from the      other unfriendly produc ers: gas-fired units, which also      release carbon dioxide; nuclear reactors, which spawn      nuclear waste; and hydroelectric plants, many of which are      ill-equipped to allow fish to pass unharmed through their      giant turbines.    </p>    <p>      "Our object, over time, is to change the mix so that there      are fewer and fewer coal and gas plants and more low-impact      hydroelectric, wind and solar plants creating the      electricity," Duncan says.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, consumers had no choice but to purchase      "brown" power from regulated monopoly utilities. The      utilities sold nonrenewable power because these were the      least expensive options.    </p>    <p>      However, customers may now have more choices for two      reasons. First, prices for alternative sources of energy -      especially wind power - have dropped dramatically in recent      years because of technological improvements. In fact, in      some parts of the country like Colorado, wind power is      close in price to the cost of electricity generated by new      gas-fired units.    </p>    <p>      Second, consumers have more power purchase options.      Policy-makers are deregulating the electric industry, and      in the states that have embraced deregulation - including      California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware      and Massachusetts - competing energy companies offer a      broader array of services. In states that are not yet      deregulated, utilities are now offering clean power to      improve their images in anticipation of deregulation.    </p>    <p>      "The utility companies see green power as a way of keeping      the environmentalists off their backs," says Eugene      Rosalie, director of Northwest Environmental Advocates'      program Renew 2000. "They want the customers to see them as      good guys."    </p>    <p>      Still, it's wise to keep an eye out for the regulated      utilities, which are most likely to deceive their      customers.    </p>    <p>      "In regulated regions, you don't have that neverending,      pots-and-pans, bang-on-drums criticism you get in      unregulated markets," says CRS's Kirk Brown. "In regulated      states, utilities' competitors won't take out full-page ads      and say 'Don't buy this one."'    </p>    <p>      In states where policy-makers have deregulated the electric      industry, new companies believe that consumers are willing      to pay extra for clean kilowatts because they want to make      the world a little greener.    </p>    <p>      GreenMountain.com is one of those well-meaning start-ups,      despite its continued run-ins with environmental groups in      the wake of Chairman Sam Wyly's highly publicized      contributions to the 2000 presidential election race. Wyly      used a loophole in IRS tax code to submit over $200,000 to      George W. Bush's presidential campaign. Though Wyly - an      avowed environmental activist-may have his heart in the      right place, Bush has been pilloried of late for his clean      air and water record as governor of Texas.    </p>    <h3>      FUTURE OPTIONS    </h3>    <p>      Whether they want to burnish their images or improve the      environment, utilities and unregulated companies from      Boston to Seattle have unveiled a variety of green power      products with a mindboggling number of price tags and      pricing schemes.    </p>    <p>      Public Service Company of Colorado, a regulated utility in      Denver, offers Windsource, a program that allows customers      to invest directly in the construction of new wind power      plants. Customers pay $2.50 per month for each      100-kilowatt-hour "block" of wind power in addition to the      $7 they'd normally pay for that much power. The utility      says that buying 100 kilowatt-hours of wind power reaps the      same environmental benefits as planting a half-acre of      trees or refraining from driving a car 2,400 miles.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Prices for wind power have dropped dramatically in      recent years because of technological      advancements.</strong>    </p>    <p>      In states like California, where the electric industry is      deregulated, GreenMountain.com offers Solar For The Future,      a product made up of 100% renewable energy, 5% of which is      from newly built solar plants. "For every 1,000 customers      that sign up for Solar For The Future, we will build new      solar generation," says GreenMountain's Woodbury. Average      customers in California, who use about 500 kilowatt-hours a      month, pay an extra $7 above their typical $50 bill. About      $15 of that bill is for electricity; the rest is for      transmission and other services.    </p>    <p>      Thomas H. Rawls, vice president and chief environmental      officer of GreenMountain.com, claims that different types      of power generation reflect different levels of virtue.    </p>    <p>      "The products are designed differently to suit different      pocketbooks," he says. "I refer to it as different levels      of virtue in a product. Choose a level of virtue you are      comfortable with and match it up with a price you are      comfortable with. Some people say, 'Hydro doesn't do it for      me; wind is more virtuous.' Then they agree to pay more."    </p>    <p>      To determine which green power program suits your needs,      ask questions about what goes into the electricity, when      the product will be "delivered", and whether the purchase      will lead to a tangible improvement in the environment.    </p>    <p>      "The most important thing is that people choose, and choose      something better than their standard power," adds Peter      West, senior policy associate at Renewable Northwest in      Portland, Oregon.    </p>    <p>      If a company says its clean energy includes power from the      "traditional mix," consumers should ask if coal, gas or nu      clear plants provide some of the power. If green energy is      combined with brown energy, consumers should be sure the      green product yields lower air emissions than their      traditional mix of electricity. To ensure green power is      truly cleaner, CRS and Renewable Northwest insist on a mix      made up of at least 50% renewable resources.    </p>    <p>      Soon, consumers will be able to rely on the advice of the      newly formed Low-Impact Hydroelectric Institute, which will      "certify" that hydro plants don't harm fish. In the      meantime, if the hydroelectric facility is located on a      river that is or was once home to wild-fish runs, consumers      should confirm that the plant owner built fish ladders to      ensure fish are able to pass by turbines without being      drawn into them.    </p>    <p>      "Hydroelectric facilities should meet fish protection      standards proposed by American rivers," says West.    </p>    <p>      Biomass energy, like hydroelectricity, is another form of      clean power that is not always forest green. Biomass plants      burn all kinds of waste to produce energy. Often generators      that burn solid waste generate too much air pollution. A      cleaner option is a biomass facility that combusts wood      waste from paper mills or farm waste such as cow manure.    </p>    <p>      "Typically that kind of biomass is left to rot, which      creates emissions or storage problems. It's cleaner to      combust it," says CRS's Brown.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Solar thermal technology uses sun sunlight to      produce hot water, heat for buildings or electric      power.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you find green power that is truly environmentally      friendly, ask when the utility will begin feeding it into      the grid. Brown suggests that some Northwest utilities      collect money from their customers, then don't deliver the      power for two years. PacifiCorp, for instance, asks for      this buffer so it has time to collect enough money to build      new wind plants.    </p>    <p>      "A utility should not take money from a customer for      renewable energy unless the utility is delivering renewable      energy," Brown says.    </p>    <p>      In addition to asking questions about when green power will      be delivered, you should be sure and understand how much      you will pay. Is the energy 10%, 20% or 30% more expensive      than traditional sources of power for each unit of energy?      When utilities sell power in blocks for a monthly premium,      it's difficult to calculate the true price of the product.    </p>    <p>      E Source's Komor says customers shouldn't balk at the cost      if it seems high.    </p>    <p>      "You usually don't have to supply all your electricity      needs with renewable energy," he says. "Just decide how      much you can afford." A higher price may reflect a      company's plans to invest in marketing, which will allow      the company to reach more buyers.    </p>    <p>      Finally, it's critical to determine how energy companies      will use the extra dollars. Will utilities funnel all the      money back to their shareholders? Or will they use it to      construct new renewable energy plants whose output will      replace polluting energy from coal-fired units?    </p>    <p>      "If customers pay a premium, they have a right to know the      world will be a little greener," says Duncan. "They don't      want to know that the profits will go to people's back      pockets."    </p>    <p>      <strong>RESOURCES</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Natural Resources Defense Council</strong><br />      40 West 20th Street<br />      New York, NY 10011<br />      (212)727-2700 www.nrdc.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable      Technologies (CEERT)</strong><br />      1100 Eleventh St., Suite 311<br />      Sacramento, CA 95814 www.cleanpower.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>Solstice</strong> www.crest.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>Center for Resource Solutions</strong><br />      Presidio Building 49, PO.
