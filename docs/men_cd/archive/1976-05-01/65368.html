                        <p> Eliot Coleman, his wife Sue, and their two daughters live      next door to Helen and Scott Nearing "way up in the state      of Maine". Up where the short growing season and the poor      soil make it impossible to raise a good garden . . . let      alone pay for a homestead almost entirely with the produce      you grow. Right? Wrong! Because Eliot and Sue are not only      raising a showplace garden and buying their homestead with      the produce they sell . . . but they're doing it all      <em>without</em> the chemicals and the gasoline-gulping      equipment which all of the agribiz magazines and newspapers      swear up and down that a farmer "needs" today.<br />    </p>    <p>      The photos above testify to the Coleman's success. And the      bibliography of biological agriculture that Eliot has      assembled (and which is printed on the following five      pages) should give you a long leg up on the preparations      you must make to (we hope) eventually enjoy the same kind      of success for yourself. This just may be one of the most      important articles we've ever run!    </p>		    <p>      The best place, always, to begin . . . is at the beginning.      And intelligent folks usually plunge into a field that's      new to them by surveying the work of those who have gone      ahead.    </p>    <p>      And now-for the first time ever, to our      knowledge-Eliot Coleman (see his family's homestead,      in color, on pages 72-73 of this issue) has made it      easy for you to survey most of the milestone work so far      accomplished in the field of biological agriculture.      Without fighting your way through a deck stacked in favor      of any particular sub-school of thought. Without listening      to your guide rave and rant against "the establishment".      Without all the rather irrational emotion usually exhibited      by biological agriculture's "true believers".    </p>    <p>      Oh, Eliot's a true believer all right. <em>In results</em>      . And it happens that he's been realizing some      interesting-even spectacular-results with his      experiments in biological agriculture. If we're lucky, he      might even share some of that work and those results with      us in forthcoming issues of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .      For now, however, we're pleased to reprint the following      list of books and papers that Eliot has found to be a      useful introduction to the field of wholistic gardening and      farming.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE		</h2>	<p>		      <strong>by<br />      Eliot Coleman<br />      A Publication of The</strong><strong>Small Farm Research      Association<br />      Harborside, Maine 04642</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is a pamphlet for the doubters . . . which, I hope,      includes everyone. There are too many unanswered questions      for anyone to be a true believer in biological      agriculture.<br />    </p>    <p>      For the official doubters, such as the agricultural      spokesmen who state that it is impossible to farm      successfully without chemicals and poisons, this      bibliography contains books by farmers who claim to have      done the impossible. For the unofficial doubters, like      those who just think that it is all too complicated, this      bibliography contains books by gardeners who make it all      sound easy. And for everyone else it contains books which      should establish that biological agriculture is more than      just "we don't use this" or "we don't use that" statements      by which it is so often misrepresented.    </p>    <p>      It would not be fair to dismiss these books offhand for      their faults. Many were written over thirty years ago and      some are not too rigorously scientific. Books that are      otherwise reasonable but weak in factual presentation have      not been excluded. Nonetheless, the conscientious reader      should use all of these guides to gain a better      understanding of biological agriculture and the many ways      of practicing it.    </p>    <p>      It would be equally unfair to condemn the titles in this      bibliography as the work of unqualified amateurs. The      attainment of a Ph.D. is no guarantee of brains and      logically the lack of same does not establish incompetence.      On occasion certain observations of these amateurs are      incorrect. That is not surprising. But is should not      invalidate their many sustainable observations nor should      the value of practical observation itself be disregarded      because the requirements of modern statistical analysis are      not fulfilled. The truly unscientific man is the one who      denounces knowledge gained by observation and experience      simply because it does not agree with the established      dogma. The province of science is investigation, not      reprobation.    </p>    <p>      Much of the controversy between the chemical and the      biological methods of agriculture has centered around      attempts to prove one system superior to the other. Such      comparisons are non-productive. It is a little like      discussing whether dairy farming is better or worse than      raising blueberries. Both are equally viable systems and      both produce food by treating the soil in a particular way.      The chemical and biological systems of farming are also      equally viable but the difference is that the former has      been thoroughly researched and the latter has not. It would      be a great step forward if research could be conducted in      recognition of the potential of biological agriculture and      with the intention of improving techniques, refining      approaches, and developing scientific parameters for      further study.    </p>    <p>      This is a good place to clear up a major misunderstanding      about biological agriculture. The scientists contend that      the elements are identical whether applied in the form of      chemical fertilizer or in the form of compost. "Nitrogen is      nitrogen", as they say. All well and good, biological      agriculture does not dispute the table of elements. But      that is beside the point. The principal object of      biological agriculture is not to supply "available plant      foods" whether through compost or any other way but rather      to create the optimal conditions of a balanced soil under      which natural processes can maintain a healthy soil-plant      economy.    </p>    <p>      This bibliography is not exhaustive. Many readers will wish      to add to it.. Every effort, however, has been made to      compile a reasonably complete list of those books which      merit attention. Most of these are out of print, especially      the older ones published in England. Notation is made in      this bibliography of those titles that have been recently      reprinted and which should be available. The rest may be      found in libraries.    </p>    <p>      There has been no attempt at mono-think. As might be      expected the authors do not always agree with each other.      Some are only involved on the periphery of biological      agriculture. Those authors are starred who present the most      reputable evidence for their case.    </p>    <p>      And finally, a suggestion for those who intend to pursue      the subject of biological agriculture through these books.      It is most important to read critically, check references,      compare, and see what the other side has to say in order      not to become, tike so many proselytizers of a new idea, "a      man of vast and varied misinformation".    </p>    <p>      <strong>ALBRECHT, WILLIAM A.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Soil Fertility and Animal Health Fred      Hahne</strong> <strong>1958</strong>    </p>    <p>      An outstanding survey of the subject by the most respected      American exponent of intelligent farming.

We put      forward this method as an alternative to the orthodox      gardening techniques, which today involve growers in heavy      labor costs and outlay on stable and artificial manures,      things which bite so deeply into profits of intensive      cultivation of vegetables and plants. When we describe how      something should be done, we have done it that way and made      a profit out of it.</p><p><strong>Dalziel O'Brien, Intensive      Gardening</strong></p><p><strong>BALFOUR, LADY EVE</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Living Soil</strong> <strong>Faber      1943</strong>    </p>    <p>      The important early work by a founder of the Soil      Association.

What it does      suggest is that the soil is sub fertile and will yield a      full crop only when the natural processes of      plant-nutrition are short-circuited by a dose of soluble      chemical salts. Such dosing, there is some reason to think,      progressively reduces the biological efficiency of the      plant soil relationship, not so much by direct toxic action      as by creating a condition of imbalance in the soil      population and (possibly) in the physiology of the plant      population.    </p>    <p>      Jorian Jenks in The Journal of the Soil Association,<br />      October 1953    </p>    <p>      <strong>GUEST, A.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gardening Without Digging 1948</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      A theory of gardening which advocates applying compost on      the surface of the land and never digging it in.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HAINSWORTH, P.H.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Agriculture: A New Approach Faber      1954</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      A fairly reasoned and well-documented study of biological      agriculture by a successful market grower.
