                    <p>      MAN-MADE ROT IS EATING AT THE HEART OF NATURE. WE ARE      DESPOILING THE HERITAGE OF OUR SONS, OUR GRANDSONS, AND      THEIR GRANDSONS.    </p>    <p>      And now-direct from England-the world's most      conscientious ecology cartoon feature. A lit tie overstated      for our American tastes, perhaps, but full of real meat,      nonetheless. Ah, if we only had a cartoon series like this      on our side of the pond! But, since we don't MOTHER      presents Mr. Crabtree Crusades!    </p>        <p>      Ted has a bit of most things on his      smallholding-fruits, vegetables, poultry, a few pigs.      He has to produce what the market demands and his apples      must look perfect. They must have no blemishes and each one      must be like the next, untouched by insects, unmarked by      anything that comes in the ordinary course of nature. That      can only be achieved by keeping nature out with various      sprays, some of which are poisonous. The result is the      apples look like plastic models-and they do not taste      very different. The skins are usually tough too. Ted would      not eat them himself-he grows them because he must      make a living, although he does think it a pity that it is      just the look of an apple that sells it to today's      consumer.    </p>        <p>      The apple that Ted picks for Peter is not a model of      perfection. Nature has had its way with it and has put on      it the marks that come from attacks of insects and other      things-but has also put into it the sweet taste that      apples should have. The tree it comes from is old and      gnarled, and is part of the garden that Ted keeps so that      he and his family can have food they can enjoy. "Anyway,"      Ted says, "the insects wouldn't go for those market apples.      They like something with a bit of taste too." Ted has hens      running under the fruit trees. "None of your battery eggs      for us," he says, "we like good natural eggs too." That      works out two ways-they have their free-range eggs,      and the hens' droppings keep the trees fertilized.    </p>
