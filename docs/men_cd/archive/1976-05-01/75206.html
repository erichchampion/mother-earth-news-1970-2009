        <p>Here are a few more of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) syndicated features which have appeared in 100+ newspapers over the past three and a half years.<br /></p><p>Now, when we're being squeezed by both a food and an energy crunch, is a good time for North Americans to discover the benefits of the Chinese wok. This simple, conical pan-you see-was specifically designed centuries ago to stretch the maximum mileage from the minimum amount of edibles and fuel. Only a little heat on its rounded bottom goes a long, long way up the sides. The Oriental practice of cutting all meat and vegetables into bite-sized pieces and quickly "stir frying" them in the utensil further insures that every bit of expended warmth cooks those edibles quickly enough to preserve almost all their fresh taste and nutritional value.</p><p>There's no need to reserve a wok only for Chinese dishes, either. As a growing number of U.S. and Canadian cooks are learning, it can easily replace several pans and become the main cooking vessel in any small city apartment or large farmhouse kitchen. It's an ideal piece of gear (much lighter than the traditional frying pan!) to pack away on camping trips too.</p><div class="sidebar"><h3>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted)<br />. . . it tells you how</h3><p>If this year's unbelievable food prices have you planting a garden for the first time in your life, a fellow named John C. Huckans has some tips you might find valuable. John, who really knows how to squeeze maximum production from a mini-garden (measuring only 20 by 50 feet) in upstate New York, says:</p><p>"For several years I wasted my time with a small, pale lettuce that grows close to the ground, gets covered with dirt during every rainstorm and is a pain in the neck to wash. Now I'm happier with the large Burpee's <em>Fordhook</em> variety which shoots up over a foot high, forms a very loose head of tasty foliage and is simple to clean. It's also slow to 'bolt' and bears salad fare an uncommonly long time."</p><p>Mr. Huckans also plants Burpee's <em>Lutz</em> beets, which produce two crops: foliage that can be eaten as greens and a late harvest of roots which store well for winter use.</p><p>"Speaking of greens," says John, "I recommend chard over spinach. The latter usually yields little and goes to seed at the first sign of hot weather. Chard, on the other hand, produces a much greater harvest of foliage and may be gathered until snow covers the ground. Its stalks and ribs may be cooked like asparagus and leafy parts prepared like spinach."</p></div><p>Jenny wrens are one of the nicest little birds to have around the backyard or homestead and many people build special small birdhouses (with an opening one inch in diameter-the size of a quarter-for house and Bewick's wrens and one and an eighth inch in diameter for the Carolina wren) to attract them. Unfortunately, a great number of these folks are disappointed when wrens refuse to occupy the houses in question. Why? Because the builders have mistakenly installed a perch at the entrance of each little home.</p><p>Wrens land directly in the entrance of their houses and have no need for a perch. Other birds (such as sparrows) which attack wrens, however, find the perches to be convenient bases from which to launch their harassment . . . and the little wrens have learned to stay away from houses that are so equipped.</p>
