                    <h5 id="byline">  by SHARON KRUSE    </h5>    <p>      If your family really packs in the pickles, what do you do      when the cucumber crop comes a cropper? Well, don't panic!      Just bear in mind that the best things in life are free . .      . and try substituting that otherwise wasted (or, we hope,      composted) watermelon rind!    </p>    <p>      Pickled rind, in fact, has much to recommend it . . . even      in a good cuke year. Besides adding color to a meal,      watermelon rind-when so preserved-is less      expensive and, in most cases, more easily prepared than      "plain ole pickles". (You can, when putting up      rind-for instance-cut thirteen days off the      ,justly famous "quick and easy" fourteen-day sweet pickle      recipe . . . and still enjoy a final product that's every      bit as good.) In addition to <em>that,</em> pickled      watermelon rind is just unusual enough for presentation to      special friends as an unexpectedly delightful gift.    </p>    <p>      But enough palaver. Here are three recipes that should get      you off to a good start . . . and give you some guidelines      for converting your own favorite pickling instructions from      cucumbers to watermelon rind. Even though the originals      call for sugar, feel free to substitute raw sugar or      honey-or what have you-and adjust the amounts      to produce the sweetness you and your family prefer in the      finished product. <em>(As a rule of thumb, Margaret Hasse,      in "The Honey Trip" in MOTHER NO. 37, suggests adding about      2/3 of a cup of honey-and deducting 3 tablespoons of      other liquid-for each cup of sugar that is left out.      For more advice, check</em> <em>The Joy of      Cooking.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      The following instructions are applicable to all three of      the pickling recipes below . . . as well as any of your own      you might want to experiment with:    </p>    <p>      Trim the dark skin and pink flesh from a thick watermelon      rind. (It's easier if you first cut your rind into long      strips, <em>then</em> peel it. And a little pink left on      adds to the color of the preserved food.) Cut the trimmed      rind into one-inch pieces, or any shapes and sizes you      desire. (I happen to have a fluted chopper, a very      inexpensive item <em>if</em> you can find one . . . mine      was a premium from a mail-order gift catalog and makes      short and pretty work of this cutting.)    </p>    <p>      Next dissolve 3 tablespoons of slaked lime -check the label      on the bag to make <em>sure</em> it's meant for      pickling-in 2 quarts of cold water, and pour the      solution over 4 quarts of prepared rind. Add more water, if      necessary, so that all the pieces are covered . . . and let      them stand 2 to 4 hours. (A substitute mixture of 1 cup      salt to 2 quarts cold water may be used, but you'll have to      let it stand 6 hours, and your pickles will not be as      crisp.) <em>(Note: I've also seen recommended-in</em>      The Joy of Cooking <em>and several other books on the      subject-the use of fresh grape or cherry leaves to add      crispness to any pickled product. Just toss a few of the      leaves in with the salt water before soaking the fruit, and      omit the lime entirely.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      After the rind has soaked, rinse it well and cover it with      cold water. Then cook the pieces of rind until they're just      tender and drain them again.    </p>    <p>      Now tie the appropriate spices-for whichever recipe      you're using-into a cheesecloth bag. Combine them      with the remaining ingredients called for by the recipe and      simmer all the natural preservatives and flavorings for 10      minutes. Then add the watermelon rind and again simmer      until it becomes clear (add boiling water if the syrup gets      too thick during this cooking process). Once the rinds are      transparent, remove the spice bag, and pack the      pickles-boiling hot-into sterilized jars (leave      only 1/8-inch head space). Screw the caps on tight      or-for smaller batches that you'll use up      quickly-simply refrigerate . . . and you're done!    </p>    <p>      Now if we could only think of a way to make use of the      green outer shell . . . tan it for moccasins, maybe?    </p>  <h3>ORIGINAL WATERMELON RIND PICKLES</h3>    <p>      This one has a nice lemony flavor and is a pretty      pale-yellow color.    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons of whole cloves<br />      3 sticks of cinnamon<br />      2 pieces of ginger root<br />      1 lemon, sliced thin<br />      8 cups of sugar<br />      1 quart of white vinegar<br />      1 quart of water    </p>    <h3>OZARK LIME PICKLES</h3>    <p>      You'll find this a bit spicier than a sweet pickle. It's      also attractive with its celery seeds floating around.    </p>    <p>      1 tablespoon of salt<br />      1 teaspoon of celery seed<br />      (do not tie in bag)<br />      1 teaspoon of whole cloves<br />      9 cups of sugar<br />      2 quarts of vinegar    </p>    <h3>SWEET ICICLE PICKLES</h3>    <p>      This was, originally, the formula for fourteen-day sweet      pickles.    </p>    <p>      1-1/2 tablespoons of mixed pickling<br />      spices (available at almost any grocery store)<br />      5 cups of sugar<br />      5 cups of vinegar    </p>
