    <p>
               		    		    <p>      In MOTHER NO. 29, I described in detail a few of the many      advantages hydroponic greenhouse gardening has over more      conventional methods of raising fruits and vegetables . . .      and in response, a reader wrote to MOTHER expressing the      following concern:    </p>    <p>      James DeKorne's information on hydroponics is quite      interesting, but one aspect of the method sticks in my      craw: The process seems so dead. It'd be fascinating to      discover if plants grown hydroponically differ in manifest      energy?on some level apart from "nutrients" alone-as      compared to those grown in soil . . . .    </p>    <p>      I've found that this is a common reaction to hydroponic      gardening, even though anyone who has had any experience      with the concept will tell you immediately that there's      nothing at all "dead" about it. On the contrary: The plants      I grow in my hydroponic greenhouse seem <em>more</em> alive      than their peers out in the garden mostly because of their      more rapid growth and prolific production of fruit.    </p>    <p>      Laboratory tests have shown that there are no nutritional      differences between normal vegetables grown hydroponically      and those grown in gardens (organic or otherwise). Neither      are there any differences in flavor: Last summer my wife      took two tomatoes?one from our garden and one from a      hydroponic tank in the greenhouse?and arranged them in      slices on two separate plates. Only she knew which was      which. After every member of the family tasted pieces from      each plate, it turned out that no one could detect any      differences in flavor . . . none of us could tell which      tomato was "organic" and which "hydroponic".    </p>    <p>      Even so, it is true that the hydroponically grown tomatoes      you buy in the supermarket often taste bland and pulpy. One      explanation for this?aside from the fact that supermarket      produce is of dubious freshness?is that tomatoes produced      in commercial hydroponic greenhouses are special hybrids      which have been bred for color, uniformity of size, and      ability to ripen all at the same time. And these, of      course, are qualities which have nothing to do with flavor,      but everything to do with the convenience and profit of the      agribusinessman who raises the fruit.    </p>    <p>      No special hybrids for me, though . . . the tomatoes we      raise in our tanks are the same varieties we grow in the      garden (Burpee Big Boy being our particular favorite).    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, not to evade the issue, the reader's letter      that I've quoted calls into question something (namely,      "manifest energy") for which I have no ready answer . . .      if indeed there is one. When we begin to talk about energy      levels beyond those that we have instruments to detect, we      begin to run up against a semantic impasse. Many organic      gardeners, I've noticed, tend to be very mystical about      their subject (and for all I know, they may be onto      something). I can only say that nothing in my experience      confirms?or denies?their esoteric beliefs. If there are      differences in the "vibes" given off by hydroponic tomatoes      versus those of soil-grown fruit, I cannot detect      them.<br />    </p>    <p>      In previous articles I've given what I consider to be sound      ecological reasons for why I am an organic gardener. (The      fundamental consideration being that the natural approach      offers the only way I know to maintain continuous sod      fertility without disastrous side effects.) In my      greenhouse gravel tanks, however, I have no reservations      about using hydroponic chemicals . . . for one thing,      because I've proven to my own satisfaction that there are      no nutritional differences whatsoever in vegetables grown      by either sod or soilless methods.    </p>    <p>      The only criticism of hydroponic gardening that I accept as      valid is the complaint that hydroponics relies (for the      most part) on the use of chemicals which are derived from      fossil fuels, or which use vast amounts of these fuels in      their manufacture. For that reason, I've recently been      working with various <em>organic</em> hydroponic solutions,      and have been both surprised and delighted with the results      of my very first efforts.    </p>    <p>      The hydroponic method of growing produce was originally      developed as a scientific tool to determine the mineral      requirements of plants. Consequently, in its commercial      applications, hydroponics has always relied upon pure      chemical salts for nutrient solutions. Very little      research, however, seems to have been done with organically      derived plant food formulas.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the most notable work that has been undertaken      along these lines was carried out in India. James Sholto      Douglas, in his book <em>Hydroponics:</em> The Bengal      System ($5.25 from the Oxford University Press, 200 Madison      Ave., New York, N.Y. 10016), describes something known as      the "Sharder process" which was developed at the      Hydroponics and Fish Investigation Unit in Bengal:    </p>    <p>      Normal beds of aggregate are employed for raising plants,      but to supply essential nourishment to crops, manure shells      or pots are placed at appropriate intervals along the      trough. These consist of earthenware vessels, lined with      some kind of sieve or screen, and pierced by a number of      tiny holes at the bottoms. The pots are filled with a      nutrient sludge or semi-liquid manure, a typical formula      for which would be:    </p>    <p>      Fresh or dried dung, one handful.<br />      Matured oil cakes, four teaspoonfuls.    </p>    <p>      Alternatively, such materials as hoof-and-bone meal, shoddy      (wool waste), and similar plant foodstuffs can be utilized,      the exact quantities depending upon their analyses. Dried      wood ashes are also fairly good for the purpose . . .    </p>    <p>      When the manure shells are placed in the hydroponic      troughs, and sunk down a few inches into the aggregate,      with only the upper portions remaining exposed, they slowly      release their nutrient contents into the growing medium.      These then become available to the plant's roots as food.      Covers should be placed over the vessels, and from time to      time they may be refilled with nutrient sludge or topped      up. Every three months the beds should be flushed through      with plain water to cleanse them . . . .    </p>    <p>      Another experiment with an organic nutrient solution is      briefly described on page 135 of the Portola Institute's      <em>Energy Primer</em> ($5.50 from your local bookstore or      MOTHER'S Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C.      28739). Here, the water from aquaculture tanks is used as      a, growth medium:    </p>    <p>      Finally, associated with each main [fish tank is a      hydroponic growing compartment where the culture water from      the main tanks (a "soup " of excellent fertilizer) is      flushed through gravel beds planted with vegetable crops.    </p>    <p>      My initial feeling when I read this was that the fish tank      effluent probably would not supply an adequate variety of      nutrients for the plants' optimum growth. Consequently, to      test this assumption I started growing some pinto beans      hydroponically, using only the water from my own      aquaculture tank as a culture medium.    </p>    <p>      At first, the bean plants put on amazing growth, rising      several inches above some "control" seedlings (which were      growing in a commercial nutrient solution). After a couple      of weeks, though, the "commercial" beans began to catch up      with those receiving only fish tank water . . . and by the      end of the month, the fish tank beans which had become pale      and sickly in appearance?had all but stopped growing, while      the other beans were normal in all respects.    </p>    <p>      These results seem to parallel those obtained by workers at      the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's fish farming      experiment station in Stuttgart, Arkansas. In the May?June      1975 issue of <em>Aquaculture and the Fish Farmer,</em>      investigators Sneed, Allen, and Ellis report on an      experiment in which the effluent from a raceway complex      containing 10,000 pounds of channel catfish was flushed      into hydroponic troughs containing 17 varieties of      vegetables. Their results?like mine?were disappointing:    </p>    <p>      The yield of edible tissue varied widely among different      vegetable varieties. Although [all] varieties produced some      edible tissue, eleven were of very poor quality and      quantity. Three varieties produced average yields and three      produced yields considered to be above average for home      gardens. The best yields were produced by green peas and      cucumbers.    </p>    <p>      It would seem, then, that people who wish to combine      aquaculture with hydroponics should consider using fish      tank water as a "starter"?an excellent basic solution in      which to germinate seeds or with which to mix other organic      materials?but not as a complete plant food by itself.    </p>    <p>      Lawrence D. Weiss, in the May 14, 1973 issue of <em>The      Tribal Messenger,</em> gives us a clue as to how to mix a      more complete organic hydroponic solution:    </p>    <p>      Homemade mixtures of such things as well-rotted compost and      animal manure are cheap and ecological. The home farmer can      experiment with different such nutrients and strengths in      the water base. In this way he or she will find the      combination most suitable for his or her plants and      installation.    </p>    <p>      Using both fish tank water and well water, I prepared      several different strengths, mixes, and types of organic      solutions . in effect, making what is familiar to most      organic gardeners as "manure teas". I used these various      liquids to grow tomatoes, radishes, lettuce, runner beans,      and pinto beans. (Most of the initial experiments were with      beans.) At the same time, identical plants received a      commercial hydroponic solution (Hyponex, 7-6-19).    </p>    <p>      At first, I was very "scientific" about everything: For      example, I would accurately weigh out 20 grams of rabbit      manure per liter of water. I soon realized, however, that      such careful measurements weren't really necessary . . .      and that moreover?most Americans would not bother to      duplicate precise efforts of that nature anyway. (It's hard      enough to persuade people to try a new gardening technique      without throwing the metric system at them!) So I ended up      with the following standard formula:    </p>    <p>      One small-size Quaker Oats box full of a mixture containing      equal parts rabbit manure, chicken manure, earthworm      castings (manure), and wood ashes.    </p>    <p>      One 20-gallon can of well water or fish tank effluent      filled to within an inch of the top.    </p>    <p>      (Note: I can't honestly say I noticed any difference      between the results I obtained with well water and those I      obtained with fish tank water, although it stands to reason      that the latter fluid would contain more nutrients. I      purposely avoided rainwater, however, since it's likely to      be deficient in the micro-nutrients manganese, boron,      etc.?which are almost always present in ground water.)    </p>    <p>      The organic ingredients were vigorously stirred into the 20      gallons of liquid and then allowed to steep for several      days (by which time all the solid particles would settle to      the bottom). The resulting liquid?which was the color of a      weak cup of tea-was next poured carefully into cans,      while fresh water was added to the original container to      make a new batch.    </p>    <p>      We found that we could get several cans of hydroponic fluid      from each batch of organic material. From time to time I      would add fresh measures of the organic mix to the liquid .      . . relying mostly?I must admit?on when it <em>felt</em>      right to do so (that is, when the "vibes" were right!).    </p>    <p>      At first, I very religiously tested the pH of the solutions      (pH being a measure of how acid?or alkaline?anything is).      All of the hydroponics books really stress the importance      of this, since plants will only thrive within certain      narrow pH ranges. Experience has shown us, however, that      the pH of our solutions both organic and commercial?is      nearly always right about where it should be: between 6.0      and 7.0. So we hardly ever even test the pH of our liquid      plant foods anymore. You probably <em>will</em> want to      analyze yours (at least in the beginning) if you try      hydroponics, however, so a short discussion of the subject      is, perhaps, in order.    </p>    <p>      As anyone who's ever had an aquarium knows, a pH test can      be performed with a special "indicator" called Nitrazine      <em>paper</em> , available from most any drugstore. When      you dip a strip of this paper in the fluid being tested,      the strip changes color (the final color depending on the      exact pH: yellow for strongly acid, blue for strongly      alkaline, or several intermediate hues for readings in      between). To find the approximate pH of whatever you're      testing, you then simply match the color of the paper      against a color chart on the side of the container it came      in. (If you're unfamiliar with this very simple procedure,      don't be alarmed . . . it isn't any big deal.)    </p>    <p>      Now, if the solution you've tested turns out to be too      alkaline, an acid must be added to "balance out" the pH.      Likewise, an alkali must be added if the liquid is too      acid. Commercial greenhouses, of course, use pure      hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH of      their nutrient solutions.    </p>    <p>      Since both of the above chemicals are extremely dangerous,      as well as expensive, we've relied?successfully, I might      add-on plain old white vinegar (acid) and baking soda      (alkali) to alter the pH of our solutions. (All this      chemical talk may sound horribly complex, but I assure you      there's nothing to worry about. As I mentioned before, we      very seldom have to tinker with the pH of our solutions.)    </p>    <p>      The results of my experiments indicate that almost any      organically derived solution will support plant growth. For      example, bean plants raised in a solution containing      chicken manure alone grew just as well as the same plants      raised in the complete complement of manures.    </p>    <p>      I must also be honest and state that two "control"      plants-raised in pure worm castings, with no water at      all?grew just as well as any of the hydroponic plants,      including those which received the commercial solution.      (This may provide an alternative for those who object to      the hydroponic concept.)    </p>    <p>      In general, vegetables raised in the commercial solution      grew slightly faster than the organic?solution plants, but      not significantly so. Actually, the most striking      difference between the two was that the organic?solution      plants <em>did not wilt</em> during the hottest part of the      day, while plants raised with the commercial solution      <em>almost always wilted!</em> (We observed this phenomenon      on a daily basis, so it isn't a figment of our      imaginations.) Bear in mind that all the plants were being      raised in a greenhouse, and that during the time of the      experiment summer of 1975?the inside temperatures often      went over 100° F conditions which would make any      self-respecting plant wilt! Within five minutes of being      fed the organic nutrient solution, however, all wilt      symptoms disappeared (the same as when you water wilting      plants in the garden or in pots).    </p>    <p>      It isn't possible, of course, to explore exhaustively the      subject of organic hydroponic techniques in these pages. A      complete treatment of this matter will appear in our      forthcoming ecosystem book. What I've outlined here,      though, should be enough to get you started. There are      many, many experiments yet to be made and different      nutrient solutions yet to be tried. We feel we've only just      begun.    </p>    <p>      Lawrence Weiss, in <em>The Tribal Messenger,</em> pretty      well sums up the way it is with this fascinating field:      "Remember that there is no 'correct way' to do anything in      hydroponic farming. Experiments and experience will always      be your best guides. One reason hydroponic farming is so      much fun is [that] everyone does it differently."    </p>   <h3>FISH TANK WATER AND PLANTS: ANOTHER VIEW</h3>    <p>      The marriage of aquaculture with hydroponics is a "natural"      . . . or so it would seem. As James DeKorne points out,      however, plants raised hydroponically in fish tank effluent      seldom grow very well.    </p>    <p>      Why? Author DeKorne hints at one possible answer when he      suggests in his article that aquaculture runoff be used as      a <em>starter fluid</em> "not as a complete plant food by      itself". The implication, of course, being that fish tank      water alone won't support plant growth because it doesn't      contain all the nutrients that plants need.<br />    </p>    <p>      Maybe that's true. Maybe not. In any case, we shouldn't      overlook another (equally plausible) explanation: namely,      that vegetables do not thrive in aquaculture effluent      because the liquid <em>contains growth inhibitors.</em> It      is well known, for instance, that fish closely confined in      tanks frequently will not grow beyond a certain size-no      matter how much they're fed?because of growth inhibitors      which they themselves secrete. Perhaps some of these      inhibitors can also affect the growth and development of      plants. The idea, we feel, should at least be researched.    </p>
