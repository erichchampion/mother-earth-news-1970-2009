    <p>
                     <p>      One of the world's most effective environmental group is      San Francisco-based FRIENDS OF THE EARTH. Although FOE      publishes <em>Not Man Apart</em> -a monthly tabloid      magazine packed with authenticated, hard-to-find facts that      every concerned citizens needs-far too few of      MOTHER's readers regularly see a copy of <em>NMA.</em> We      are therefore quite pleased that FOE's staff has agreed to      write a regular FRIENDS OF THE EARTH column for THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS (restricted).    </p>    <h3>SUPERSONIC ALBATROSS RIDES AGAIN</h3>   <p>      The United States' supersonic transport (SST) program was      killed in 1971, and environmentalists everywhere lauded the      event as a major victory. Concern over the Big Bird's sonic      booms, potential damage to the stratosphere's ozone layer,      gluttonous fuel consumption, and questionable economic      impact all combined to convince Congress, in March of that      year, to drop all federal funding behind the development      and construction of the plane. <em>But</em> . . . .    </p>    <p>      Today, the SST issue has risen ghostlike to haunt Americans      once again. Last fall, England and France formally      requested permission to fly their own supersonic      craft-the Concorde-into Kennedy and Dulles      airports. And early this year, after listening to endless      hours of testimony and reading reams of written material on      the subject, Secretary of Transportation William Coleman      announced his decision: Concorde would be allowed to      operate two round trips a day out of each of the American      airports, for a "trial period" of sixteen months.    </p>    <p>      Even the staunchest critics of supersonic flight were      surprised by the overwhelmingly negative response to the      Secretary's statement. Lawsuits were filed almost before      the ink was dry on Mr. Coleman's speech. Bills to ban      landings at Kennedy International Airport were submitted to      both the New York and New Jersey legislatures. And      demonstrators, to underscore their feelings, staged two      "drive-ins" that clogged traffic around Kennedy.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, spokesmen for Air France and British Airways      insisted that the matter was settled, and that they'd begin      flights on schedule. But the plane's opponents threatened      to stage a sit-in on the runways, if necessary, to      discourage the landings. So airline representatives,      fearing that widespread publicity from such an event would      tarnish their image, backed off from their original      timetable and declared that they'd abide by the courts'      decisions.    </p>    <p>      As the situation stands now, it's difficult to imagine the      European SST ever landing at Kennedy . . . but Dulles,      which is operated by the federal government, may prove to      be a different story. Nearby residents appear to be united      in their opposition to the Concorde,      but-unfortunately-such local citizens, even      when tightly banded together, stand little chance of      winning in any showdown with the bureaucrats of the U.S.      government.    </p>   <h3>1976: THE YEAR FOR REFORM OF U.S. FORESTRY      LAWS</h3>    <p>      As you read this, there is virtually no operable law      governing forestry practices on public lands . . . but      legislators are now (finally) scurrying to fill the void.    </p>    <p>      Much of the sudden interest in the issue comes as a result      of a lawsuit filed last year which successfully challenged      clear-cutting in national forests as illegal under the      Forest Service Organic Act of 1897. The law states that the      Service may sell for cutting "old, dead, or mature" trees.      Clear-cutting-which involves leveling every tree of      every size in an area (from seedlings on      up)-obviously isn't what the Organic Act's authors      had in mind.    </p>    <p>      You can be sure that several bills (each offering a      different "solution" to the problem) will be proposed in      Congress before the sawdust settles. Nevertheless,      conservation groups are already lining up behind just one:      Senate bill 2926, which has been introduced by Senator      Jennings Randolph (D-W. Va.).    </p>    <p>      The measure-which could go a long way toward      reversing the current trend of converting our national      forests into commercial tree farms-would [1] limit      clear-cut areas to 25 acres (past operations in some parts      of the Pacific Northwest have laid waste to hundreds of      acres at a time), [2] ban the use of DDT and other      chlorinated-hydrocarbon pesticides in national forests, [3]      order the Secretary of Agriculture to write specific      guidelines (such as "stay away from stream banks", "avoid      erosion-prone areas", etc.) under which cutting would be      allowed, [4] discourage "type conversion" (the practice of      replacing natural species with "introduced" species), and      [5] encourage "all-age" over "even-age" management (which      means the USFS would be required to favor development of      forests containing mixed stands of young, old, and "in      between" trees, rather than planting-and      harvesting-entire tracts of same-age timber all at      once).    </p>    <p>      The legislative battle is just beginning, and we don't even      know yet which bill the Administration will support      (although we suspect that it will be a much milder one than      the Randolph proposal). We'll do our best to keep you      up-to-date, though . . . just stay tuned.    </p>    <h3>UNEP THREATENED BY REDUCTION OF U.S.      SUPPORT</h3>    <p>      One of the good things Richard Nixon did as President      (there <em>were</em> a few) was to commit the U.S. to      providing substantial support for the United Nations      Environment Programme. But now Dr. Kissinger's State      Department-on the verge of backing down on that      promise-is thus jeopardizing UNEP's ability to do its      genuinely crucial job of fostering environmental      cooperation between nations.    </p>    <p>      It's much too early to judge whether the young organization      will be able to tackle the assigned task successfully      anyway, but one thing is certain: Everyone will suffer if      this country cuts UNEP off at the pocketbook before the      group so much as has a chance to begin work.    </p>    <h3>DOW IN THE DELTA</h3>    <p>      Dow Chemical (the company that brought you napalm) has a      new idea: It wants to build a gigantic chemical plant on      the headwaters of San Francisco Bay!    </p>    <p>      Dow apparently thinks it would be economically inefficient      to cart new oil from the Alaska Pipeline all the way down      to the company's processing plants in the South, because      the naphtha and other industrial chemicals produced there      would then have to be shipped back across the country to      California (where the market for such products is      strongest). So . . . the company has set its sights for      plant construction on a relatively unspoiled agricultural      area in the Sacramento River Delta.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, local residents and Bay Area environmental      groups are plenty unhappy over the idea. They've gone to      court to stop the project, and Friends of the Earth is      leading their side of the fray. If you'd like to help and      have some spare change, we'd be grateful for any      contributions (they're tax deductible) that would help us      pay legal expenses. Just send your donation-clearly      marked "for the Dow Fund"-to Friends of the Earth      Foundation, 529 Commercial, San Francisco, Calif. 94111.    </p>    <h3>THREE GENERAL ELECTRIC ENGINEERS JOIN NUCLEAR      OPPOSITION</h3>    <p>      Three top-level engineers from the nuclear division of      General Electric Corporation recently resigned, calling      fission power "a technological monster that threatens all      future generations" and pledging to work for passage of      California's nuclear initiative (which, as we discussed in      this column in MOTHER NO. 33, would require utility      companies to <em>prove</em> -to the satisfaction of      the state legislature-nuclear energy's safety,      reliability, and economic feasibility).    </p>    <p>      The resignations shook the atomic industry to its      foundations. The engineers-Dale Bridenbaugh, Richard      Hubbard, and Gregory Minor (highly regarded employees who      had worked for GE for 22, 16, and 16 years      respectively)-were immediately whisked to Washington      to share their knowledge and concerns with Congress' Joint      Committee on Atomic Energy. And several state legislatures      invited the trio to come testify before a number of other      boards and committees.    </p>    <p>      The "GE Three" related a number of reasons for their      decisions to quit. Among them were last year's fire at the      Browns Ferry reactor in Alabama (which came within a      whisker of causing a catastrophic accident), and the      all-too-possible application of "peacetime" nuclear      technology to military purposes (one instance cited was the      detonation in India a few months back of an atomic bomb      made with materials that came from a nuclear plant      supposedly designed to generate electricity).    </p>    <p>      Other professionals have left the industry in the past, of      course, but most of those individuals were scientists      (which, to many people, brands them as "eccentrics" who      can't be fully believed). When nuclear <em>engineers</em>      say fission energy is unsafe, however, we suspect (and      sincerely hope) that a lot of folks who previously shut      their ears to dissent will begin to listen at last.    </p>    <h3>COALITION PUSHES SOIL REFORM PROGRAM</h3>    <p>      We've seen a lot of statistics in our day, but this one      tops 'em all: Before Europeans colonized Noah America, this      continent's topsoil averaged <em>three feet</em> in depth.      Today's average is six inches . . . and the figure      continues to decline every year.    </p>    <p>      Armed with those facts and hundreds more, a group of      environmentalists and organic farmers has drafted a      National Soil Recovery Program and submitted it to both the      Republican and Democratic parties for possible inclusion in      their respective election-year platforms. The Program's      major thrust is simple and straightforward: Commit the      United States to the goal of returning agricultural wastes      to the land. The practice would begin a long-overdue      replenishment of the soil . . . and, at the same time,      reduce pollution problems by making productive use of      materials that are now dumped willy-nilly into streams and      oceans, where they cause serious ecological damage.    </p>    <h3>CONGRESS CONSIDERS TOXIC SUBSTANCES      BILL</h3>    <p>      Every year, thousands of new chemicals are developed and      introduced into the marketplace . . . and from there, of      course, they eventually make their ways into our      environment (that means water, soil, air, vegetation, fish,      wildlife, and you and me, folks). And every once in a      while, one or more of those new substances turns out to be      a real lulu that causes cancer or other serious diseases.    </p>    <p>      Critics have long held that control of such materials is      inadequate, and Congress is now considering proposals aimed      at correcting the situation. Senate bill 776, the Toxic      Substances Control Act, would give the Environmental      Protection Agency regulatory power over all chemicals used      in industrial and consumer products (the only exceptions      would be food additives and pesticides, which are already      screened under other laws).    </p>    <p>      The legislation would grant the EPA the right to require      testing of all substances (both old and new) at the expense      of the manufacturers, and would also dictate that      industries report to EPA the amounts and types of chemicals      they are producing. In addition, the Agency would be      empowered to place an outright ban on any material it      deemed harmful.    </p>    <p>      The House's Toxic Substances Control Act (H.R. 10318) is      considerably weaker than its Senate counterpart, but      Representatives Bob Eckhard (D-Tex.) and William      Brodhead (D-Mich.) are spearheading efforts to      strengthen the bill in committee.    </p>    <p>      There's considerable corporate resistance to both measures,      of course, and two major opponents are the Manufacturers'      Chemical Association and our old familiar foe, Dow Chemical      Company. Letters to your Congressmen, urging support of a      strong and enforceable toxic substances control law, would      surely help to offset the industry's powerful lobbying      efforts.    </p>
