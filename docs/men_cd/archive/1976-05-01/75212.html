                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Independence on a 5-Acre Farm    </h2>        <p>      Copyright © 1973 by John and Sally Seymour,      Introduction copyright © 1973 by Schocken Books, Inc.    </p>    <p>      Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Four years ago, when there      were <em>NO</em> currently relevant small-scale-farming      introductory handbooks available, many of us welcomed the      publication of Richard Langer's <em>Grow It!</em> with open      arms. Now that we're all older and more experienced,      however, some folks find it increasingly easy to criticize      that breakthrough beginner's guide (see the      <em>Feedback</em> sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24 and 25).    </p>    <p>      Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is just      as important (probably more so) now as <em>Grow It!</em>      was two years ago . . . and which may well come up for its      share of criticism in another 24 months or so.    </p>    <p>      Be that as it may, John and Sally Seymour's record of 18      successful years on a shirttail-sized homestead in England      <em>is</em> important now and should offer welcome      encouragement to today's back-to-the-landers . . . both      real and imaginary. I started serializing the book in my      No. 25 issue and I'm sure that many readers will want a      personal copy for their home libraries.-MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      <em>. . . flowers, and showers, and stomachs, and meat, and      content, and leisure to go a-fishing.</em>    </p>    <p>      IZAAK WALTON    </p>    <h3>      FRESHWATER FISH    </h3>    <p>      The industrial working man's sport of catching fish out of      freshwater canals, lakes and streams, weighing them, and      throwing them back again, is as puerile as pulling wings      off flies, but I suppose it is better than watching hired      men playing football, for at least it gets its devotees      away from a crowd. The men who do it will solemnly assure      you that these fish are not edible anyway, and further that      if they throw them back it will keep the stocks of fish up      so other anglers will have a chance to catch some. They are      wrong on both counts. There is no freshwater fish that      lives in England that I know of that is not excellent to      eat. And to crop, or harvest, the fully grown fish is good      for the stocks, in that it gives the younger ones a chance      to live and thrive. It is very good for the health and      welfare of a stock of fish in any piece of water to remove      the full grown fish that have had a chance to breed once or      twice and allow the younger generations some room.    </p>    <p>      I have eaten most kinds of English freshwater fish, very      many kinds of African ones, and in the Burma jungle during      the war we used to kill far more fish with our hand      grenades than we did the enemy. I have never yet found a      freshwater fish that was bad to eat. Some people manage to      persuade themselves into thinking that freshwater fish      taste "muddy". But in sober fact freshwater fish do      <em>not</em> taste "muddy". It is all in the imagination.      If there is still anxiety on this score, however,      freshwater fish from muddy places can be let to swim in      clean water overnight or longer before cooking, as is done      in France sometimes with carp.    </p>    <p>      There are plenty of ways of taking fish far more      effectively than by "angling" but most of them are against      the laws of this country. As they are not against the laws      of every country though it is quite permissible to describe      them and-who knows?-maybe the laws of      <em>this</em> country might change one day; the laws of Man      are not immutable, if those of God or Nature are. We will      therefore discuss some methods of taking the better edible      freshwater fish, fish by fish.    </p>    <h3>      SALMON    </h3>    <p>      The salmon is the king of freshwater fish and that nobody      would try to dispute. He spends most of his adult life at      sea and is in far better condition caught at sea if mature      and off his homeland, for he is at his prime, clean and      full of vigour. The monofilament net with a mesh of 5-1/2      inches has made the taking of salmon at sea practical, and      shown that there is a greater stock of salmon at sea than      had ever been thought. The salmon comes into fresh water to      spawn. In an ideal world, if the true welfare of salmon      were really considered, I believe he should be netted at      sea and left severely alone while in fresh water, for he is      there strictly for breeding. The spawning rivers would, of      course, have to be kept clear of obstruction and      unpolluted, no doubt by the State, for a major incentive to      do so would be lost.    </p>    <p>      But nevertheless we do catch him and eat him when he has      entered the rivers, and the sooner after he has entered the      fatter and better he will be. In countries where there is      no law against it, netting is the best way of taking      fresh-run salmon. The new monofilament nets of man-made      fibre are perfect for this. If put across a stream at night      (the salmon lay up in the day, move upstream at night)      salmon will swim into it and gill themselves. For salmon a      net of 5-1/2 inches is used (4-1/2 inches is better for      small salmon and sewern, or sea trout), six meshes deep,      mist green colour, hung on head rope of 1-1/2 mesh for two      (which is a way of saying the net is bunched up on the head      rope-not pulled tight). The head rope contains      plastic floats just sufficient to keep it up and the foot      rope just sufficient small leads to keep it down.    </p>    <p>      Gaffing is the method of taking fresh-run salmon most used      by poachers in this country. The gaff is a hook about 3-1/2      inches across the mouth and has a barb on it. A gaff with      no barb is no good-you will simply wound fish, which      is unforgivable. It is not fixed permanently to a stick but      concealed in a pocket, and it has a line attached to its      eye. The poacher walks slowly along the river bank gazing      intently into any deep water near the bank. Under      overhangs, under rafts of sticks, under submerged roots of      trees are the places. He must gaze intently and long into      one place, for a salmon is very hard to see. Many poachers      wear polaroid glasses and these are an enormous help for      they cut out the glare of the sky on the water. When the      poacher sees his fish he goes and cuts a light stick the      right length, lashes his hook to one end of the stick with      its own line, takes the loose end of the line (which has a      loop in it) up to the other end of the stick and puts the      loop on his wrist. Very carefully he leans over, pushes the      gaff into the water, and gaffs the salmon in its middle. He      lets go of the stick, the line unwinds and releases the      stick from the gaff and the poacher is left with his salmon      on the hook and the hook tied to his wrist by a long line.      He hauls the fish in, gets him high up on the bank, and      bashes him on the head with a priest if he has one (a      priest is a small club-it "administers the last      rites"), or with a well-aimed blow from the foot. He then      conceals the gaff in his pocket again, conceals the fish in      the undergrowth and starts to worry about how to get it      home without being seen. Of course if he has a fishing rod      with him, and has a licence, he just carries the salmon      home openly and says he caught it on a "Butcher's Glory" or      some such artifact and gaffed it to get it out of the      water.    </p>    <p>      Some poachers poison rivers by liming, or cyanide, or other      disgusting substances. I would send all such poachers      straight off to Siberia. Such practices are absolutely      unforgivable, for they kill every fish in the water, great      and small. To take the odd salmon with the net or the gaff      may be against the laws of Man but it is not against the      laws of Nature or of God. To poison water is nothing less      than blasphemy, and a deadly sin.    </p>    <p>      Now having caught your salmon (legitimately, with a fly of      course, no poaching methods for us) you have to cook it. If      you want it cold, put it in a pan, cover with water,      vinegar, and olive oil in equal parts, add bay leaves and      pepper and salt, bring to boil, simmer for ten minutes per      pound of fish. Let it cool in the cooking liquid.    </p>    <p>      To smoke <em>Salmo salar</em> (and this is what you should      really do with it because there is just nothing like real      smoked salmon. The "smoked salmon" you buy nowadays is      often not <em>Salmo salar</em> at all but a distant      relative that is imported from Japan in enormous frozen      blocks then half smoked and dyed to make it look like real      salmon. Also, smoked stuff can never be deep frozen and      still taste any good):    </p>    <p>      Fillet but leave the lug bones on.<br />    </p>    <p>      Remove ribs; this is difficult but if you get your salmon      you will soon see how to do it. You have to trim the flesh      away a little and pull the ribs out with a pair of pliers.      String through the shoulder. Carefully score through the      skin at the thickest part so the salt can penetrate. Lay      fillets on a layer of fine salt skin-side down and put 1/2      inch of salt on cut surface. Start with 1/2 inch at      thickest part-taper off to hardly any salt on tail.    </p>    <p>      Leave in salt 12 hours for a 1-1/2 lb. to 2 lb. fillet, 18      hours for a 3 to 4 lb. fillet, 24 hours for a 5 lb. fillet      or over. These times are terribly important. But if the      underlying flesh (the flesh under the surface) still feels      soft give more time in the salt. Wash the salt well out of      them and dry. Smoke for 24 hours at 70° F. (21      °C.), then for 12 hours at 80° F. (27°C.) in      light smoke.    </p>    <p>      The fillet should lose 10 per cent of weight in salting and      10 per cent in smoking.<br />    </p>    <p>      Some smokers rub on molasses, others brown sugar; some      sprinkle saltpetre, some pour rum on. I prefer to pour the      rum down my throat and wipe the fillets lightly with olive      oil before and after smoking. Both rum and oil do more good      that way.    </p>    <h3>      TROUT    </h3>    <p>      There is little to say about trout, beyond that any country      boy in the trout areas of Britain knows how to tickle them      and I have a friend who pokes them out of holes under tree      roots or rocks with two sticks which have an onion net      between them. They fly out into the onion net.    </p>    <p>      To smoke trout: gut and clean well; soak 1 hour in 80 per      cent brine; pierce through eyes with a metal speat and prop      belly open with a match stick; put in smoke still wet at      90°F. (32°C.) for half an hour; give them two hours      at 180°F. (82°C.). They are then "cooked smoked"      and should, like smoked salmon, be eaten cold and raw.    </p>    <h3>      EELS    </h3>    <p>      Eels are the most underestimated fish in Britain. They are      highly prized in every country of the world that I know of      except Britain and Norway. The eel is perhaps the most      delicious and nutritious of freshwater fishes.    </p>    <p>      Eels, by the way, can be taken in "hives", which are      torpedo-shaped baskets of withies with inverted funnels in      one or both ends of them which are sunk below the water and      baited. Nowadays most people make cages of fine-mesh wire      netting to do the job instead. Fresh chicken guts make a      good bait, so do sea-water shrimps or their heads. Eels can      also be caught with the long-line: that is a long line with      many hooks along it. Bait the hooks with worms and leave      the line down overnight. I have filled many a tin bath up      with eels by <em>babing.</em> To do this you collect a      bunch of worms, thread each worm on a piece of knitting      wool, tie them all up in a knot or "bob", tie them on the      end of a string and hang the string from a short stick. Go      out in a boat in the shallow of an estuary and lower the      "bob" to the bottom. After a minute or two bring it over      the boat (and the tin bath), give it a sharp shake and you      will shake the eels that are clinging to the bunch of worms      off into the bath. But the eels you want for smoking are      the big fat silver eels that are on their way off to sea      after their seven or eight years in fresh water to lay      their eggs in the Sargasso Sea. Eel traps on the weirs of      watermills used to catch these, and many a miller paid his      rent with his eels, and many a mill owner still could, if      he smoked them before he sold them. To cook fresh eels:      half skin, stuff, and pull the skin back to hold the      stuffing, hold eels with a rag.    </p>    <p>      To smoke eels: gut (do not skin), clean, lay in dry salt      for 12 hours; hang on sticks and dip in boiling water for a      few seconds. This makes them open out; smoke at 140°F.      (60°C.) for from 2 to 4 hours according to size.    </p>    <p>      For the cooking of all other freshwater fish I will refer      you to <em>The Compleat Angler,</em> the recipes in which      make one drool at the mouth.    </p>    <h3>      FISH FARMING    </h3>        <p>      The way in which freshwater fish can make a really      important contribution to the self-supporting community is      by fish farming. An acre of fish farm in the tropics will      yield five tons of fish per year (half a ton of beef is a      good yield off an acre of the very best grassland), and the      fish farms in cold East Germany yield 242 kilograms per      hectare per year. In days gone by fish farming was a very      important branch of animal husbandry in Britain. John      Tavern, writing in 1600, recommends making big shallow      ponds, keeping the ponds flooded one year and dry the next.      When dry, plough and seed their beds with clover and then      graze with cattle: "their dung and stale together with the      natural force of the Sunne . . . will breed flies and bodes      of divers kindes and sortes", which the subsequent fish      will fatten on. You should drain your pond to be dry about      the first of November. Take the best fish thus exposed by      draining the pond to your stew pond, which is a small, deep      pond for storing fish for the winter: deep so the frost      won't kill them. They will keep there until you want to eat      them. The smaller fish you put in the pond that you have      newly flooded and which has had cattle grazing on it all      summer. They will thrive in this and grow and fatten for      next winter. Taverner says the ponds should be under six      feet deep and on boggy land, fit for nothing else (but 4      feet is deep enough). He advises only to handle fish in      cold weather. The fish he recommends are carp, bream, tench      and perch, but he has reservations about bream because they      spawn too freely and overstock the pond. If you have pike      you can afford bream-the pike will keep them within      reason. He recommends feeding fry with oatmeal. A carp will      commence eating when 1 inch long. Old carp, he says, are to      get: "sodden barley and mault steeped in water and sodden      pease". He liked to have cattle feeding near the fish      ponds, geese to keep the grass short and as "good watch      dogs", and ducks to do good by keeping weeds down and      manuring the water.    </p>    <p>      Taverner's methods are obviously a good example of proper      husbandry: interaction between different crops and animals      and interdependence. The fish fertilized the subsequent      grassland, the cattle fed the subsequent fish. Modern      fish-farming practice is heading back for this sort of      husbandry, and all Taverner's recommendations are modern      practice.    </p>    <p>      Carp are the classic stew-pond fish. They don't need      running water, live well in small ponds, and are very good      to eat. They must have half the food they eat natural pond      food, so you must encourage the natural organisms of the      pond by throwing in muck or compost. Any kind of animal      manure will do and can simply be tipped into the pond but      not, of course too much; only enough so that the bacteria      of the pond can cope with it comfortably. You can then add      a considerable amount of artificial food: oatmeal, barley,      corn of any sort. If you put 100 lbs. of trout fry in you      can expect to get 450 pounds of fat fish out in three      years' time. Schaperclaust <em>(Die Karpfenteichswirtschaft      in der Deutch Demokrotischen Republik)</em> says that ponds      which have sewage effluent running into them near Berlin      are yielding 10,000 kilograms of rainbow trout per hectare      per year! Trout need running water according to this      writer, from five to ten litres per second into a pond of      ,100 square metres. They want at least five feet of water.      Only rainbow trout can be fed on sewage      effluent-brown or brook trout need clean water. You      can stock up to five trout per square metre of water      surface. Trout are carnivorous and must be fed on finely      ground meat or fish. You can buy proprietary trout food in      England. You can buy young trout from trout farms, or breed      your own in indoor tanks by squeezing the roe from an adult      hen and squeezing into it the milt from an adult cock.    </p>    <p>      I have never done fish farming, but simply write so much      about it in the possibility that it will arouse interest in      someone with more energy than I have. An excellent book on      this subject, from which I have drawn much of the above, is      Fish Culture by C.F. Hickling (Faber and Faber) and another      is <em>Fish and Invertebrate Culture</em> by S.H. Spotte      (Wiley, New York). (For method of controlling water in      ponds see illustration below.)    </p>    <p>      But anybody can improve the carrying capacity of a trout      stream by building some small dams to cause deep "holding      pools", or adapt an old mill pond by letting loose some      fish fry in it and encouraging them by throwing in some      crushed corn from time to time, or fish meal or meat meal      for trout. From there it might develop into something more      systematic and scientific in the true sense of the word.      There is a lot of swampy land which could only be drained      at a prohibitive cost but which, with the help of a      bulldozer or mechanical digger, could cheaply be turned      into big shallow fish ponds, which could be laid dry every      alternate year to provide good grazing for cattle in the      summertime. When laid dry it should be heavily limed and      dressed with phosphatic manure and sown to clover.    </p>    <p>      All fish will deep freeze, but do not delude yourself that      deep-frozen salmon or trout, for example, bears any      relation to fresh fish. And never commit the atrocity of      freezing smoked products of any kind.:    </p>
