        Compost is simply decayed organic matter Leaves make good compost. So do coffee grounds. Grass clippings. And kitchen scraps. (Avoid meat and fat ... they smell.) Turn your pile with a pitchfork once a week and keep it damp. When you add finished compost to your garden, it adds nutrients to the soil and creates rich organic humus.
