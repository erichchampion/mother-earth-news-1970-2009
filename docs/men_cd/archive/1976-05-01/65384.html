                            <p>      "Only three things a young feller's got to git to start      hisself a farm," some old-timers used to say, "a piece of      dirt, a cow, and a wife . . . and he don't strictly need      that last one."    </p>    <p>      Ahem. Yes, well. Times have changed. But there's sound      advice to be found in that bit of chauvinism from the past,      and today's homesteaders would do well to consider what      great-grandpa was <em>really</em> saying: that next to land      itself, there's nothing more indispensable to a family farm      than a good dependable milk cow. And if you don't agree      now, you probably will by the time you've finished the      first chapter of Merril and Joann Grohman's recently      released book on the subject.    </p>    <p>      The Grohmans, you see, have a pretty good grasp on what it      takes to become at least partially self-sufficient. They've      been there . . . and still are, on a spread up in      southwestern Maine. And one of the lessons they've learned      from rural life is that there's much to be said for the      food, fertilizer, and cash money that can be had by keeping      and caring for at least one productive dairy animal. What's      more, they've come to the conclusion-after trying all      the options (including goats)-that that "one      productive dairy animal" should be . . . the soulful-eyed      Jersey.    </p>    <p>      In case you don't know, jerseys first came to this country      from an island of the same name off the coast of France.      And as the Grohmans are quick to point out, the strain is      smaller than any other, has a longer lactation life,      consumes less feed, produces 12 tons of valuable      nitrogen-rich manure and urine every year, and yields milk      (600-1,000 gallons annually) that's highest among all      breeds in terms of butterfat, vitamin, and mineral content.    </p>    <p>      <em>And,</em> say Merril and Joann, the Jersey is an      especially adaptable creature that can be put to pasture on      rocky, hilly soil that can't be used for crop production      and might otherwise lie fallow (which pretty much blows      away the common argument that keeping any cow is "wasteful"      because it yields less food than might be harvested if the      pasture such an animal requires were sown in vegetables      instead).    </p>    <p>      The Grohmans have called their book <em>The Cow      Economy,</em> and have done nothing short of a superior job      of explaining just how and why a Jersey can be the basis of      real self-sufficiency for anyone with a tiny piece of land      (or even just a garage that can be converted to a stall).    </p>    <p>      In fact, it's difficult to imagine any aspect of the      subject that Merril and Joann have not covered: There are      detailed chapters on buying, housing, feeding, milking,      handling, breeding, calving, treating, and grazing a Jersey      . . . and still others on making and selling dairy      products, harvesting hay for feed, and using manure to      enrich garden soil. There's even a section that explains      how to take a vacation and provide good care for Ole Bossie      while you're gone.    </p>    <p>      In other words, <em>The Cow Economy</em> is well-nigh      all-inclusive. If you've been looking for an inexpensive      way to raise food and money on the homestead, look no more.      One of the best home enterprises of them all is explained      right here.    </p>    <p>      You're not likely to find <em>The Cow Economy</em> at your      local bookstore, but you will find it in your mailbox if      you send $3.95 to the Grohmans (at Coburn Farm Press, Box      M, Star Route, Dixfield, Maine 04224) and wait a week or      so. You can bet your back forty that you'll be glad you      did.    </p>
