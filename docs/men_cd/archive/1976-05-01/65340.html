                        <p>      Shades of Don Quixote Are we seeing specters from The Land      of Wooden Shoes? Is this the Ghost of Windmills Past come      back to chastise us all for our silly, modem ways?    </p>    <p>      Could be. The structure you see here-dubbed "The      Windy-Ten"-is an exact replica of a      15th-century Dutch hollow post mill, built to precise 115      scale. And it's been generating . .'. well, a      <em>little</em> electricity, and a <em>lot</em> of admiring      double takes from folks who pass by Jack J. Maas' property      up near Shelby, Michigan.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Maas tells us that his wasp-waisted wonder-complete      with 14-foot sails and a revolving upper housing/stairway      assembly that can be turned into or away from the      wind-was constructed in a few months from original      plans that he translated into English and scaled down for      practical purposes. Obviously, the mechanism ain't the      power producer that some of today's advanced windplants are      . . . but then again, we've never seen a Savonius turbine      or Jacobs three-blader that looked quite as good as this      Old World charmer. And Jack says his machine is capable of      lighting lights or running small electric appliances if      situated in a suitably high-wind (15-20 mph) area.    </p>    <p>      You say you think you'd like to build one of these little      replicas yourself? Well, you're in luck . . . because Mr.      Maas has put together a complete set of plans (three 30" X      42" blueprints, a 20-page step-by-step construction guide,      and electrical diagrams and schematics) that he says can be      used by any reasonably skilled handyman to duplicate his      machine. The kit costs just $15.95 . . . but if you'd like      to know a little more about the windmill first, send $ 1.00      to Jack J. Maas, Box 111, Shelby, Mich. 49455 and he'll      mail you an informative 4-page brochure.    </p>
