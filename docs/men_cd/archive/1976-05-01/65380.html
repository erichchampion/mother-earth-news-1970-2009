    <p>
                   <p>      The recipe that follows is a basic formula for producing      natural (uncolored, unprocessed) hard cheese at home. Keep      in mind, however, that domestic cheesemaking is an      imprecise art at best. Many variables-such as how      "ripe" the milk is, the length of time (and the temperature      at which) the curd is heated, and the number of weeks of      curing-affect the flavor and texture of the end      product. As a result, you may find that you have to      slightly adjust the techniques involved to suit your own      tastes and kitchen conditions.    </p>    <p>      To begin making cheese, all you need besides milk is a      floating dairy thermometer (most any immersible type will      do), two enameled containers (one of which can "nest"      inside the other), rennet (available at most drugstores, or      from Chas. Hansen Laboratory, Inc., 9015 W. Maple St.,      Milwaukee, Wis. 53214), a long-handled spoon and knife,      three or four yards of cheesecloth, a colander, a one-pound      package of paraffin, a press something like the one      detailed below . . . and an all-abiding appetite for good,      flavorful food.    </p>    <p>      (Our thanks to Chas. Hansen Laboratory, Inc. for providing      much of the information presented here.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>1. PREPARE THE MILK:<br /></strong> <strong>HEAT TO      86° F</strong>    </p>        <p>      Allow four quarts of the evening's fresh whole milk (either      cow's or goat's) to ripen overnight in a cold place      (50-60° F). Mix in four quarts of the next      morning's milk and <em>heat the two gallons of liquid to      86° F in an enameled container.</em> (Note: In her      <em>Old-Fashioned Recipe Book,</em> Carla Emery forgoes the      night-long ripening process, and simply begins her      cheesemaking in the morning by heating all eight quarts of      raw milk at once. Still others say it's all right to make      cheese from pasteurized whole milk or even skimmed milk,      <em>if</em> you add the "starter" discussed in Step 2. )    </p>    <p>      <strong>2. ADD "STARTER"<br />      (OPTIONAL)</strong>    </p>        <p>      "Starters"-cultured buttermilk, plain yogurt, or milk      held at room temperature until it clabbers-are      sometimes used to increase lactic acid content and thus      strengthen cheese flavor. If you've "ripened" raw milk as      described in Step 1, or if you prefer a very mild cheese,      you can now add rennet to the warm liquid. If you're using      pasteurized or skimmed milk, or desire a "zestier" product,      thoroughly mix into the 86° F fluid a cup and a half of      any of the above substances (or a commercial "starter"),      cover, and let the solution set in a warm shaded room for 2      to 4 hours before proceeding to Step 3.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3. MIX IN RENNET</strong>    </p>        <p>      Dissolve one-quarter of a "Hansen's Cheese Rennet Tablet"      in one-half cup of cold water (or use any other rennet      brand according to directions). Put the container of milk      in a larger pan of warm (88-90° F) water, and      stir in rennet solution. (Note: Rennet is produced from an      enzyme found in calves' stomachs, so vegetarians often use      non-animal-derived substitutes sold in health food stores.      And in <em>Stalking the Healthful Herbs</em> , Euell      Gibbons suggests employing the liquid from cooked stinging      nettles. "When one adds as much common table salt to this      juice as it will absorb," says Euell, "the mixture acquires      the ability to coagulate milk, like rennet.")    </p>    <p>      <strong>4. LET SET</strong> <strong>UNTIL CURD BREAKS      CLEANLY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once the rennet has been mixed in thoroughly, cover the      container and let the mixture stand undisturbed until a      firm curd forms (30-45 minutes). To test the      "readiness" of the concoction, slip your finger (washed, of      course) into the coagulated milk at a 45° angle and      lift up slowly. If the curd breaks cleanly on a straight      line-and leaves no residue on your finger-it is      ready to be cut. If it's still the consistency of tired      yogurt, be patient, and try again a bit later.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5. CUTTING THE CURD:</strong> <strong>SLICE TWO      WAYS VERTICALLY, THEN TWO WAYS AT AN ANGLE</strong>    </p>        <p>      Use a clean butcher knife or spatula long enough so that      the instrument will go all the way to the bottom of the      container without the handle dipping into the "set" milk.      With the blade held straight up and down, cut the curd into      even squares of about 3/8" (as shown in Positions 1 and 2      of the illustration). Then use your knife or spatula at an      angle (see Position 3) and-starting about 1" from the      side of the container-carefully undercut the curd      into pieces about 1/2" to 1" thick. (Begin at the top and      make each slice about one-half inch to one inch lower than      the one before.) Next give the pail (or whatever you're      using) a half turn, and draw similar angular cuts from the      other side (as shown in Position 4). You needn't worry if      the sections are not geometrically perfect "textbook"      cubes. The basic idea here is simply to divide the      congealed mass into small pieces of relatively uniform      size, in order to help speed the separation of the curds      (the solid part of milk) from the whey (the liquid      portion).    </p>    <p>      <strong>6. STIR CURD BY HAND CONTINUOUSLY FOR FIFTEEN      MINUTES</strong>    </p>        <p>      Stick your hand into the squishy curd (it's fun!) and      thoroughly-but very gently-stir the cut-up      mixture with long, slow movements around the container, and      from the bottom up. Carefully cut up the larger pieces of      coagulated milk as they appear, but <em>don't squash the      curd</em> . Try to make all the chunks as nearly the same      size as you possibly can. Stir continuously with your hand      for a full fifteen minutes, to keep the pieces of curd from      sticking together. If your arm gets tired, just remember      that there's nothing a child enjoys more than thrusting a      bare little hand into goo and swooshing it around a bit . .      . which is essentially all that's required here.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7. WARM SLOWLY FOR ABOUT 1 HOUR TO 102°      F</strong>    </p>        <p>      With the container still in a larger pan of water, slowly      heat the mixture "double boiler style" to 102° F,      raising the temperature of the curds and whey about a      degree and a half every five minutes. Stir with a clean      spoon frequently (if not constantly) to keep the curd from      lumping together, and to maintain an even temperature      throughout the concoction. You'll notice that-as more      and more whey separates and rises to the top-the      solid chunks will become firmer. Continue heating slowly      (the process usually takes about one hour) until the      curd-which should eventually look somewhat like      scrambled eggs-holds its shape and readily falls      apart on your hand without squeezing. If it appears to      still be too soupy, don't lose patience. Heat a little      while longer-even to one or two degrees above      102° F, if necessary-until the curd <em>does</em>      pass the test.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8. STOP HEATING.<br /></strong> <strong>STIR      OCCASIONALLY FOR 1 HOUR</strong>    </p>    <p>      Remove the container of curds and whey from the pan of hot      water and let it set. Stir every five or ten minutes to      keep the lumps from matting together. As the curd cools, it      will contract and force out more whey. Let the solid curd      stand in the warm liquid for about an hour, or until most      of the fluid has separated. (It is important to allow the      curd to become firm, or your cheese may have a weak, pasty      body and develop a sour or undesirable taste.) To test for      "doneness", squeeze a small handful of curd gently, then      release it quickly. If it falls apart and shows very little      tendency to stick together, you're ready to go on to the      next step.    </p>    <p>      <strong>9. POUR CURD</strong>    </p>        <p>      Line a colander with three to four square feet of      cheesecloth, and set a pan underneath. Fasten the fabric to      the strainer with clothespins. Pour the mixture in and      allow to drain, then hold two corners of the cloth in each      hand and let the curd roll back and forth without sticking      together for two to three minutes, so more whey can run      off. When the curd feels springy and rubbery and "squeaks"      when you chew a small piece, it's ready to be salted. (Use      the reserved vitamin-rich whey in bread recipes, as a treat      for livestock or household pets, or as a skin softener for      face and hands.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>10. SALT THE CURD</strong>    </p>        <p>      Place the cloth that contains the curd in an empty pail or      pan, and sprinkle one tablespoon of salt over the white      mass. Mix well with your hands-without      squeezing-and then add an additional tablespoon of      salt, and mix again. This step is for flavoring purposes      only, so you may want to adjust the amount of salt you use      in subsequent batches to suit your taste. (Note: Carla      Emery and some others who've written on the subject advise      adding the sodium chloride in three portions rather than      two, in order to be sure the salt is dispersed evenly and      consistently throughout the curd.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>11.</strong> <strong>FORM INTO BALL</strong>    </p>        <p>      Once the curd has been salted, lift the cheesecloth up and      tie the four corners together crosswise to form a kind of      elongated sack. Pat the curd into the shape of a ball, and      hang the whole works up over a pan. Allow the bundle to      drain for around one-half to three-quarters of an hour.      (Note: This step represents yet another area of      disagreement among cheesemakers. Some skip this stage      entirely, while others steadfastly maintain that the cheese      ball should hang for three or four hours. We recommend      draining your first batch of cheese the suggested one-half      to three-quarters of an hour, and then experimenting with      longer or shorter "hangings" later on if you feel there's a      need.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>12. DRESS THE CHEESE</strong>    </p>        <p>      After the bundle of curd has drained sufficiently, place it      on a flat surface and remove the cloth from the ball. Take      a clean dish towel (or some other piece of fabric with a      similar "weight" and shape) and fold it lengthwise to form      a multi-layered band about three inches wide and two feet      long. Wrap the strip around the ball as tightly as you can,      and fasten the ends securely with safety pins to make a      kind of circular "girdle" for the cheese. Push the mass      down firmly with your hands, and make the top surface      smooth by crumbling and pressing the curd with your      fingers. Your round loaf of cheese should not be more than      six inches across, or have cracks extending into its      center, because either condition can make your      "masterpiece" dry out too much while curing. (Note: When      great-grandma "girdled" a batch of homestyle goodness, she      usually used a wooden hoop designed especially for the      purpose, rather than a cloth "belt" like the one you've      just fashioned. Unfortunately, those very handy-and      undoubtedly superior-implements have gone the way of      the buggy whip in this country. If you do happen to run      across one in your great-aunt's attic, however, lay claim      to it pronto. You'll find that the ingenious little device      beats the above improvised "headband" by a country mile.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>13. PRESS CHEESE</strong>    </p>        <p>      All you need to build a good, serviceable cheese press like      the one sketched at the right is two 1" X 8" X 12" boards,      four bricks, and two 1" dowels (pieces of an old broomstick      will do). Once you have the press constructed, place three      or four thicknesses of cheesecloth on top of and under your      round of cheese. Put the covered curd on the bottom board      of the press, push the upper plank down so that it rests      squarely on the cheese, and place two bricks on top. Before      you go to bed at night, turn the wrapped round over and      weight the "sandwich" down with a total of four bricks. Let      stand till morning.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>14. PARAFFIN. STORE IN COOL PLACE</strong>    </p>        <p>      Remove the cloths and place your cheese on a board in a      cool, airy place. Turn the loaf once or twice every day for      a few days until a dry rind has formed. (If a mold appears,      simply cut it away or wipe it off with a solution of salt      and water.) Once a hard outer skin has developed, heat some      paraffin to 210°-220° F in a deep pan, and      dip the cheese-first one half, then the      other-in the hot wax. (Some folks prefer to "paint"      the liquid on with a brush, while others elect to rub      vegetable or mineral oil-instead of      paraffin-onto the cheese's surface.) Store the round      in a root cellar or similarly cool (45°-55°      F) area. Turn it over each day for several days, then two      to three times a week. The round is usually ready to eat      after three to four weeks . . . but most cheesemakers agree      that sixty to ninety days of aging is best for a really      mellow, well-ripened, flavor-some cheese.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION:</strong> If you'd like to      learn more about cheesemaking, we recommend that you read      <em>Making Homemade Cheeses & Butter</em> by Phyllis      Hobson (available from Garden Way Publishing, Charlotte,      Vt. 05445, or MOTHER'S Bookshelf, for $2.95) and the "Dairy      Section" of Carla Emery's <em>Old-Fashioned Recipe      Book</em> (available for $12.95 from The Living Room      Mimeographer, Kendrick, Idaho 83537).    </p>
