                    <p>      <strong>THE WINDJAMMER 475</strong> billed "the most      powerful private wind turbine now operating in the United      States" - is a prime attraction at the 150-acre      Dorney Amusement Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania. This      101-foot-tall generator - with four 75-foot blades      - has a maximum power output of 225,000 watts ...      enough to handle an estimated 10-15% of the park's total      electric needs! School groups visit the site for free      lectures on alternative energy, and plans are underway to      use the big turbine to power pumps ... which will supply      the park's extra water needs during the summer      months.<br />      <br />      <strong>FAT PEOPLE EAT UP ENERGY</strong> , according to      two researchers at the University of Illinois. The pair's      calculations show that there are 850 million pounds of      excess fat on American men ... and 1.5 billion on the women      of this country. The fossil fuel energy required to provide      the food calories to maintain this extra body weight would      more than supply the annual residential electrical demands      of Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington ... or      fuel about 900,000 autos each year!<br />      <br />      <strong>SUN-OF-A-GUN!</strong> The Pentagon's 1979 Military      Construction Authorization bill requires the incorporation      of optimum solar systems in all new military housing, and      in 25% of other new "defense" facilities. This ruling is      expected to pour $100 million into the solar products      industry each year.<br />      <br />      <strong>ENORMOUS GROWTH IN U.S. GEOTHERMAL      DEVELOPMENT</strong> has resulted from tax breaks included      in the National Energy Act and Man guarantees provided by      the U.S. Department of Energy. Utility companies in the      West have already developed "earth power" plants, and the      DOE has discovered a promising geothermal source for the      East Coast in the Delaware/ Maryland peninsula.<br />      <br />      <strong>A HOMEMADE HEATER</strong> which warms 35 gallons      of water in a fireplace and then circulates it through      copper pipe-kept contractor Steve Sizemore's      three-bedroom house in Bethany Ohio at a comfortable      70Â°F during this past winter. With most of the      materials purchased at cost and the family doing all the      labor, the heating system (which loses about a quart of      water a day) cost only $400.<br />      <br />      <strong>"A BUILDING IN THE SUN"</strong> , a documentary      film about an environmentally designed building (it uses      solar energy for heat, hot water, and light!) is available      to the public-for rent or sale-from Griffen      Productions, Pells Road, Rhinebeck, New York 12572. The      20-minute color production focuses on the Plant Science      Building owned by the Cary Arboretum of New York's      Botanical Garden, which is the largest privately financed      solar structure in the Northeast.<br />      <br />      <strong>WE JUST HEARD IT</strong> ... but last July, a      stranded boater-looking for help-climbed a      fence at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear facility.      He made his way into the plant ... knocked on two doors ...      and, finally, surprised two guards at their posts. Is it      any wonder that this (and other!) nuclear installations      have been criticized for lax security?<br />      <br />      <strong>AN ENERGY EDUCATION PACKET</strong> which includes      more than 25 simple student projects-teaches      elementary and secondary students about different forms of      renewable resources ... sun, wind, water, and biomass.      These reading lessons and background supplies ($3.95      each)produced in response to over 70,000 requests for such      material-are available from the Center for Renewable      Resources, 1028 Connecticut Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C.      20036.<br />      <br />      <strong>SUNFLOWER POWER!</strong> In Fargo, North Dakota      Paul Gunkelman produces logs from the shells of sunflower      seeds ... a material which, up to now, has been thought      unusable for any practical purpose. Gunkelman reports that      compressed seed-logs will burn for about an hour and      produce about 8,500 Btu's apiece.<br />      <br />      <strong>A PESSIMISTIC CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE      REPORT</strong> recently stated: "Under the worst      conditions, failure to design and implement an energy      policy in the United States ... could endanger the nation's      security, the world's monetary system, and international      economic growth ... and could eventually shake the very      social and political foundations of the nations of the free      world."<br />      <br />      <strong>A SOLAR SOCIETY IN 50 YEARS</strong> is the goal of      the Solar Lobby, and that group describes just how such a      change can be brought about in their new booklet, Blueprint      for a Solar America , available-for $2.50-from Solar Lobby,      1028 Connecticut Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036 ....      Reduced nighttime lighting has actually been shown to      <strong>LOWER CRIME RATES</strong> .... A " <strong>HIDDEN      CONSERVATION MOVEMENT</strong> " was blamed (by the utility      industry's trade journal Electrical World) for the fact      that last summer's expected % increase in peak power      demands never materialized .... For information on      low-interest loans to <strong>ASSIST VETERANS IN THE      PURCHASE OF SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS</strong>      <strong>,</strong> contact the Veterans Administration ....      Also, the Small Business Administration has broad      authorization to provide direct loan and loan guarantees to      those who wish to <strong>START A SOLAR BUSINESS,</strong>      or to individuals who are already involved in the solar      industry .... By 1980, 16% of all <strong>CARS BUILT IN      BRAZIL WILL BURN BOOZE,</strong> and auto parts stores in      that nation already sell a $200 kit that converts      conventional engines to run on 100% pure alcohol.    </p>
