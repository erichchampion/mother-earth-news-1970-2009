                    <p>      <em>As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen are      light years ahead of most of us when it comes to getting      back to the land and living a life of voluntary simplicity      as</em> <em>well they should be, since they originally      homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green</em>      <em>Mountain: away back in the autumn</em> <em>of      1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good</em> <em>for</em> <em>the Yearings on      that mini</em> <em>-farm ... until the slopes around them      exploded into ski resorts in the early 50's, forcing Helen      and Scott to move on to a rocky inlet on the coast of Maine      and start all over again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens ... just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with</em>      <em>MOTHER's</em> <em>readers in a regular question and      answer column. If you'd like to get in on the action, send      your question or questions about self-sufficient living on      the land to Helen and Scott Nearing,</em> <em>THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS (restricted) P.O. Box 70,</em> <em>Henderson ville, N.      C. 28739. And please don't expect personal replies to your      queries. The most important and most frequently asked      questions will be answered here</em> - <em>and here      only</em> - <em>where we</em> all <em>can read what      the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>		<hr />        <p>      <em>Is there any way-short of building a      wall-to keep marauding raccoons from devouring our      sweet corn every year?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Even a stone wall doesn't keep out raccoons, simply      because the masked animals climb about as cleverly as house      cats. If they can't manage your walls, 'coons will clamber      over the wooden gates. Only adequate electric wiring will      keep the cunning rascals out. In fact, the persistent      beasts have just about convinced us to give up on trying to      grow corn . . . though last year-with late      planting-we managed to harvest a fair crop before the      little marauders broke in.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>On a friend's recommendation, we also tried a new      method of discouraging such incursions. We covered the      ground of the corn patch with masses of newspapers held      down by handfuls of earth. The theory behind this scheme is      that raccoons don't like to walk on paper and will avoid      doing so even at the cost of a meal. It worked for a while,      too, but the critters soon saw through our plan. Therefore,      we can't recommend the procedure.</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      In Living <em>the Good Life you</em> said you've been able      to devote an average of only four hours per day to "bread      labor" . Fantastic! But to what do you attribute this      efficiency: engineering training, su per-organizing, lack      of middlemen ... or what?    </p>    <p>      <strong>This "work day" is the result of careful and      economical planning, tending to business and the refusal to      be distracted, and consistent minimizing of our own      personal needs. But please remember that the four-hour      figure is based on a year's average. Some days we have to      labor longer, and at other times we don't work at      all.</strong>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      I know that just managing a farmstead can give a person      quite a workout, but do you pursue any other forms of      exercise on a regular basis?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Just follow us around for an ordinary working day      and see if we're not more than adequately physically      occupied. We shovel, fork, dig, bend, stretch, saw, chop,      weed, pick, construct, hammer, mix, etc. We don't need any      artificial</strong> <strong>calisthenics to keep us fit and      supple in our 70's and 90's.</strong>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Out here in the and West, many farmers (including      ourselves) have trouble with alkaline soils. Our earth also      tends toward heavy clay, and those plants that we can get      to grow remain stunted. Do you have any experience      with-or suggestions on-how to deal with      alkalinity?    </p>    <p>      <strong>We've had no experience with alkaline soil. Our      Maine earth tends to be acid, and we treat it with ground      limestone and wood ashes. We do, however, have a yellow      clay subsoil ... which we lighten with sand, sawdust,      forest loam, and compost.</strong>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Are you-or have you ever been-affiliated with      any religious group?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Neither of us attends any church, unless it's for a      concert or lecture. We don't feel the need for a preacher      or priest to dictate our actions or morals. Instead, we've      worked out a way of life for ourselves that we regard as      both ethical and moral. Of course, our lifestyle isn't      perfect, and we're continually tested and testing as      problems arise. The main thing is, however, that we try in      life to do as little harm and as much good as      possible.</strong>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      We're making plans to build our own stone house. Can you      tell us how to eliminate the problem of moisture that we      have in our area? Also, are there any how-to books on this      subject that you could recommend?    </p>    <p>      We built our home in Vermont when commercial Insulation was      unknown to us, so we left an inch of air space between the      stone-and-concrete walls and the inside paneling. That      house was never damp. Our dwelling here in Maine is      protected by an inch and a hall of commercial insulation,      which also effectively eliminates the problem.    </p>    <p>      We can recommend the following books on stone house      building: <em>The OwnerBuilder's Guide to Stone      Masonry</em> by Ken Kern, Steve Magers, and Lou Penfield      (Owner-Builder Publications, 1976) $6.00 ... <em>How to      Build a Low-Cost House of Stone</em> by Lewis and Sharon      Watson (Stonehouse, 1975) $5.95 ... <em>Build Your Own      Stone House Using the Easy Slipformed Method</em> by Karl      and Sue Schwenke (Garden Way, 1975) $5.95. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: These volumes are available from any good bookstore      or</em> - <em>for the listed prices plus 95  cents      (three or more books, $2.00) shipping and handling</em>      - <em>from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739.]</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      How do you feel about synthetic materials? Do you use any,      or do you only stick to natural fibers?    </p>    <p>      <strong>There are advantages and disadvantages to both      types of fabric. Natural fibers can involve the      exploitation of animals, If not their deaths. But</strong>      - <strong>though we deplore the misuse of another      living thing</strong> - <strong>we do use wool.      Synthetic fibers, on the other hand, are not as pleasing to      wear</strong> <strong>... but they're cheaper and nowadays      readily available for most forms of clothing. Like most      everyone else, we use some of both, but avoid leather in      belts and shoes when we can.</strong>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Common sense-plus all the material I've read on      building with stone-says to build with clean rocks.      However, the rock piles on all the old farms in my area are      covered with mossy growth. So ... how do you clean a stone?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Concrete won't stick or set on mossy or dirty      stones. Many of our rocks, therefore, come from the beach      and have been washed clean by the tide. The rest are      salvaged from old stone walls or from earth that has been      disturbed by road crews. We</strong> <strong><em>do</em>      find <em>it</em> few rocks that awe covered with mossy      growth, and we scrub them clean with a wire brush.</strong>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      I have a great number of blueberries growing on my      property. Is it possible to turn them into blueberry wine      or brandy? If so ... do you have a recipe that you like?    </p>    <p>      <strong>We regard alcoholic drinks as one of the most      detrimental and dangerous substances In the present      American diet. Needless to say, we offer no recipes for      producing such drinks.</strong>    </p>
