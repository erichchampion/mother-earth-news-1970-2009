        <p><strong>In Issue No. 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts regarding one of mankind's better ideas - barter - and offered up an interesting suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied ... and announced our still standing offer: Anyone (and that means you!) who sends us a short (200 words or less) account of an actual barter that's good enough to print will receive - as the folks on the following pages have-a twelve-month subscription (or extension of same) to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(R).</strong></p><p>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , Inc., P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739</p><p>I've recently been playing the nomad circuit-traveling the country looking for land to settle on -and have found a way to satisfy my weakness for good restaurant food without putting a dent in my pocketbook.</p><p>When my lady and I finish enjoying a fine meal-and before I pay the tab-we check out the establishment's restrooms ... for needed repairs (not to escape through a conveniently located window!). Then, we go to the management and offer to fix-in exchange for our dinner-any leaky faucets or clogged drains that we find. Such jobs usually take only about 30 minutes or so-plus a few  cents for washers, etc.-and we're often asked to come back the next day to do major repairs (for cash!) before the business opens. We've always found the restaurants happy with our work ... and our tummies contented with their food!</p><p>We carried this kind of barter a step further when I installed all of the plumbing in a small "organic" restaurant in exchange for a years worth of free dinners! (Anyone with some knowledge of plumbing can use this swap technique ... or-as an alternative-try offering kitchen work or cleaning for the same mouthwatering benefits.) The owners saved valuable starting capital by letting me perform the labor, and I ate well for a long while! In fact, the total prices of those meals probably exceeded what I would've charged for the job ... but everyone was happy with the trade and with the friendship formed because of it.</p><p>This last item-friendship-may be the greatest value of all in the swapping game. It's certainly a benefit you won't always receive in a cash-for-goods exchange!</p><p><strong>David Blume<br />San Francisco, Calif.</strong></p><p>We've always had pretty good luck exchanging our labor for cheaper rent, but this year we've gotten the best deal ever. We lease a nice old three-bedroom, two-story farmhouse on seven acres-with all the outbuildings anyone could want for only $150 a month ... and in this part of Washington State, that's really a bargain!</p><p>But, the best part about our present situation is that we don't have to pay with cash ... at all. The good man we rent from supplies us with a truck, chain saw, and land that he wants cleared ... and we make our rent payment every month by delivering a heap o' cut trees to his doorstep.</p><p>Our arrangement makes our landlord happy (it keeps him warm, too!) and allows us to save what cash we do have for a future place of our own. As you can imagine, we feel that barter is a blessing, for sure!</p><p><strong>Bob & Carol Ness<br />Vancouver, Wash.</strong></p><p>MOTHER did it for us! I mean, before we read of what other people were doing, the idea of swapping just never occurred to my husband and me ... but now we swap every chance we get!</p><p>We've traded labor for a bank of chicken nests, hay baling for storage space in our barn, cake decorating for help at canning time, eggs for babysitting, white potatoes for sweet yams ... and made lots of Aber small swaps as well.</p><p>Our latest exchange involved one of the two hogs we raise each year. We moved to our new place too late in the year to raise a calf, but we <em>did</em> manage to buy a couple of 70-pound pigs early enough in the season to bring them up to market size. Then we traded one of the porkers to a local locker plant for a side of beef. So now we have a freezer full of steak and burgers, and pork chops and sausage ... all for a total investment of just $70!</p><p>Thanks for the idea, MOTHER. And, folks ... keep on swappin'!</p><p><strong>Gary & Carol Hoffman<br />Gilman City, Mo.</strong></p><p>My brother-in-law and I wouldn't even have a homestead if my mother hadn't taught us what she knew about bartering. Luckily we both lived around Mom long enough to learn the trade from the "expert" herself ... and those teachings are what landed us our present happy situation.</p><p>When we found a 40-acre tract of land with Moccasin Creek running smack through the center of it-and when we saw that flat valley with fields to support our needed gardens ... and the treecovered, wildlife-rich Ozark mountains on either side-we figured our homestead dreams were about to come true.</p><p>I guess nothin' really worth much comes easily, though. The old man who owned the land said he had to have cash, and no matter how we figured it, we didn't have enough to swing the deal.</p><p>Then we found out that the owner's house had recently burned down and he was planning to hire someone to replace it. So, we put our building abilities on the line and approached the man to see if we could make a trade. We told him we had enough money to buy the material for a small, nothin'fancy home: That would take care of the down payment. Then, for an agreement from the proprietor to let us pay the rest on time, we bartered ourselves into the construction of his new house ... and the purchase of our mutual homestead!</p><p><strong>Jeffrey Sunnerville<br />Jordan. Ark.</strong></p><p>We've been reading your swaps column for several issues now, and I'm astounded that no one has suggested the most obvious (to me!) swap of all. Shortly after we made our move to the land, I let it be known-to all the friends and relatives we left behind in the city-that we'd be happy to accept any and all donations of rummage: clothes, linens, home furnishings, kitchenware, or what have you.</p><p>As a result, I haven't had to buy a sheet, towel, or canning jar in the past six years! I've clothed my husband, myself, and three growing boys-with a little help from my sewing machineand have been able to share the generosity with a local home for retarded adults and a "free store" that provides for burned-out families.</p><p>In return for the treasures they bring, our friends and relatives get to spend a day at the farm and usually leave our home laden with surplus eggs, milk, jam, and- in summer- vegetables.</p><p>Ours is what I call a good swap! We soothe our friends' consciences by accepting used but useful things that are too good to throw away, and they ease our budget ... we're both happy!</p><p><strong>H.R. Gloss<br />Troupsburg, N.V.</strong></p><p>When my family first moved to rural Tennessee four years ago, we started swapping with our nextdoor neighbors ... an 80-year-old couple who had lots of experience with hard work and selfsufficiency (they never <em>bought</em> anything but coffee and salt ... while raising eight children!). We began-somewhat warily-by trading our early cabbage plants for their late ones. Then we got all their surplus corn in exchange for all our extra eggs. Soon we were eagerly swapping rides to town for lessons on how to care for bees, butter for learning how to grow beans without bugs or poison, and juice from our apples for the use of their cider press.</p><p>There were a lot of jobs those old folks could no longer do, but knew <em>how</em> to do ... and a lot we could do, but lacked the know-how. So, we just merged our strengths to overcome our weaknesses.</p><p>Two years ago the man died, and his wife moved in with a daughter. We missed them, their knowledge ... and their swaps. But then the old couple's son came to care for the place next door. He knows lots about hard work and self-reliance, too ... and he also likes to trade! Now we exchange homegrown beef and milk for hay, pasture for mowing fields, and our bumper garden and fruit crops for <em>his</em>... and our barter is in its second generation!</p><p>You just can't beat good tradin' or good neighbors!</p><p><strong>Linda Miller<br />Hampton, Tenn.</strong></p>
