                        <p>      Are you disgusted when you cook ground beef and discover      that it's half fat? Does your temper flare when your      eagerly anticipated, expensive steak is so tough you ham to      attack it with a sharpened knife and tensed muscles to saw      the meat into chewable pieces? If so, you should try eating      beefalo!    </p>    <p>      In addition to being more flavorful and tender than beef,      this "new" food is actually more nutritious, too! Take a      look at the accompanying chart to see just how much more      food value is contained in a cut of beefalo than in the      meat of more common cattle!    </p>    <p>      It doesn't take a specialist to analyze the dramatic      differences between the two types of meat and conclude that      beefalo is indeed superior nutritionally. Also, its higher      protein level-and the fact that "half beef" is very      low in cholesterol - makes it possible to satisfy      protein requirements while eating less meat and-at the same      timereduce saturated fat intake and gain extra calcium,      phosphorus, potassium, and vitamin A.    </p>    <p>      What about flavor? For the past three years, we've sold      custom-slaughtered beefalo to numerous families for their      home freezers, and the response has been overwhelmingly      favorable. Every customer has been completely satisfied ...      and amazed at the full-bodied taste of bovine-bison when      compared to commercially available red meat.    </p>    <p>      I can add the praise of my own family, too: After having      beefalo on the table, we find it difficult to accept any      other form of beef. A quarter-pound of ground beefalo, for      example, makes a large patty (dubbed a "beefalo burger" by      my children) which remains the same size when it's cooked      ... and bison-cross steaks are lean and juicy. Moreover,      with less fat to insulate it, a four-pound roast reaches      the medium-rare stage in one hour at 350Â°F This quicker      cooking prevents the natural juices from evaporating, and      the added moisture accentuates the tenderness of the      short-mined meat.    </p>    <p>      It's hard to believe that anything so healthful can taste      so good!    </p>    <h3>      BEEFALO VS.
