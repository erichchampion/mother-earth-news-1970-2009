    <p>
                        <p>      Jim McHale (who, as you may remember, was <em>MOTHER's      nominee</em> for U.S. Secretary of Agriculture <em>back      in</em> 1977) is a guy who can always be counted on to      speak his mind. The former Agriculture Secretary for the      state of Pennsylvania has-for years-      <em>championed the</em> cause of the American family farmer      ... and has often done so in the face of strong opposition      from large, vested agribusiness interests.    </p>    <p>      Recently, <em>McHale gave</em> a speech-about just      such concerns-at the American Association for the      Advancement of Science convention in Houston, Texas. In the      following excerpt from that <em>address, the</em> outspoken      agriculturist points out-with his usual      accuracy-just what's wrong with our nation's current      farm policies. And as always, Jim isn't content to simply      identify problems ... he proposes some solid, commonsense      solutions as well!    </p>		<hr />    <p>      While the large "agribusiness" concerns are encouraging the      increasingly heavy use of commercial chemical      fertilizers-notably nitrogen-the soil biota      that is vital to fertile ground is being destroyed. A      teaspoon of healthy, living earth contains more life forms      than there are humans on this planet. And if inhaling      anhydrous ammonia fertilizer will kill a man, imagine what      this chemical is doing to the soil's microbial ecosystems!    </p>    <p>      The future of crop production depends heavily on natural      nitrogen fixation, but our present agricultural practices      are actually hindering this process! Only a very few      spokesmen in the research and educational establishments      are worried about-or even aware of-the decline      of organic matter in our soils.    </p>    <p>      Part of the problem, as I see it, is a result of the      misdirection of United States Department of Agriculture eff      orts ... and a lack of unity between the Department's      policies and those of the various agendas. To illustrate      this point, let me be a bit more specific about the sort of      practical research that the USDA is not-at      present-carrying out:    </p>        <p>      [1] The Department hasn't-for the last 30      years-collected data on humic levels (the indicators      of healthy organic decay) in the nation's vital farmlands.    </p>    <p>      [2] All of the USDA's information on the subject of the      organic levels of our soils in general is over 10 years      old!    </p>    <p>      [3] No work has been done on the increase or decrease of      average numbers of soil microflora ... and we have no      reliable information on the impact of chemicals and      monoculture (one-crop) farming on beneficial soil biota.    </p>    <p>      I, for one, think it's about time to ask whether or not our      government agencies are concerned about such questions.      Could it be that those bureaus know that anhydrous ammonia      (which, as I said, is a fertilizer commonly recommended by      "agribiz") was used during World War II to "ce ment" the      earth ... to form jungle landing strips? And, do those      officials, in fact. believe that the soil is nothing more      than a means of holding a seed or plant so it can be      conveniently injected with chemicals?    </p>    <p>      The hard facts of the matter are that our once-fertile land      is suffering from 30 years' worth of toxic chemicals and      artificially disrupted ecosystems ... furthermore this      destruction has been carried out with a total disregard for      its long-term effects upon soil, plant, animal. and human      life.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, the end results of soil erosion and      deterioration-problems brought about by "chemical      farming"-have been masked by large crop yield figures      ... misleading numbers that are a result of the      ever-increasing amounts of fertilizer being applied to the      land. That mask is finally beginning to slip.    </p>    <p>      For instance, our national consumption of commercial      nitrogen fertilizer <em>doubled between</em> 1966 and 1977      ... while per-acre crop production in the United States      increased by only 13%. (The balance of our 23% total crop      increase came from planting more land.)    </p>    <p>      Per-acre yields of maize, soybeans, sorghum, wheat, and      potatoes have not shown a rise since 1970, and it is      estimated that it takes five times more fertilizer today      than was required to produce an equivalent harvest in 19491    </p>    <p>      If this trend is to change (and it must!) we will need a      commitment on the part of both government and educational      institutions-to conserve our most finite resource ...      the living soil. Last year, however, land-grant      institutions in the United States devoted 6,000      man-years to production efficiency projects, and only      258 man-years to rural development. I think this is a sign      of badly mixed-up priorities ... and I'd like to make a few      recommendations on just how we can begin to alter the      potentially disastrous direction in which American      agriculture is heading.    </p>    <p>      [A] Congress should require that the USDA apply 50% of its      research funds to small farm demonstration and research      projects ... programs that will work toward the goals of      soil and energy conservation.    </p>    <p>      [B] A substantial amount of agricultural research money      should be earmarked for the testing of now Ideas and      products. (There are 4.000 pesticide experts in Iowa alone,      but I don't know of a single U.S. land-grant institution      that teaches organic farming or understands the ecological      approach to agriculture.)    </p>    <p>      [C] The evaluation of new products and concepts should be      performed "in the open"- thereby allowing free access      to the public-by our land-grant institutions and      extension services.    </p>    <p>      [D] I urge the Department of Energy to establish a national      low-energy demonstration farm and rural life center ...      where both the invention of products and the application of      new concepts can be presented and tested. Furthermore, such      innovations should be checked out - under the supervision      of government recorders by the men and women who developed      the ideas ... rather than by some disinterested (or even      negatively prejudiced) "expert".    </p>    <p>      There are limits to growth. The United States only contains      6% of the world's population, yet we account for 34-40% of      the earth's energy and resource consumption each year! By      the year 2050, half of the world's present supply of      farmland will be taken over by urban and industrial      development ... and-in the same short span of      years-the planet's population will quadruple.    </p>    <p>      There is an immediate need to support innovative research      in this nation, to prepare mankind to meet the winds and      tides of change, and to restore and maintain the soils on      which our food is grown.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Jim McHale has recently put some of      his ideas to work as a consultant to J & J      Agri-Products and Services, Inc. and Sn-Corp., Inc. ...      firms that promote and distribute ecologically sound farm      products. Anyone who wishes to have a complete transcript      of the above speech or who would like more information      about the eco-agricultural approach to soil      improvement-can write Jim (enclosing a      <em>self-addressed, stamped</em> envelope) at J &      JAgri-Products, Inc.. 148 South Baltimore Street.      <em>Dillsburg.</em> Pennsylvania 17019.    </p>
