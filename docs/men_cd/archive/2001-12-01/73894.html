        <h5 id="byline">By BARRY DOWLING</h5><p>Here is a picture of a compost tumbler I built out of recycled material: one old 55-gallon drum, an old hospital bed frame and rollers, one old hinge and some scrap pieces of aluminum. The only things I bought were the latches. Since this picture was taken, I have added two rings around the barrel to keep it from walking from left to right. It works great!</p><p>BARRY DOWLING<br />East Vandergrift, Pennsylvania</p>
