                <p>      <em>Edward Morris recalls his "colthood" more vividly than      his childhood because of what he calls...</em>    </p>        <p>      --------------------------PHOTOS      BY NORMA      MORRIS----------------------    </p>            <p>      Though I've never been trained in Eastern religion, I'm a      firm believer in reincarnation . . . because I actually      spent many of my younger years as a horse! </p><p>I was converted      from boy to beast during my family's own little energy      crisis in the mid-40's. Back then, we got all the "home      power" for our West Virginia farmstead from one of the      small natural gas wells that pocked our remote valley. One      fateful morning, however, that well ran out . . . and our      lights, stove, and heater just up an' died. Of course,      electricity wasn't available in our rural area, so my      father had a choice to make: either move the family out, or      start moving wood <em>in</em> .</p><p> Now if your notion of a      wood-fueled household is based on less-than-personal      experience, you may think that fuel gathering is simply a      matter of stepping out the back door-to a neatly      stacked log pile-and picking up a convenient armful      of billets.</p><p> Unfortunately, that's <em>not</em> "the way it      was". My father, three brothers, and I had to make weekly      forays into the hills to cut trees and snake the felled      timber out through thick and bumpy woods. At that time,      most folks used a draft horse to haul their timber.      However, such a beast cost too much in feed to pay its own      way (at least on our modest farm), so my father hired a      neighbor with a steed to do our log lugging.</p><p> But      then-on the day that changed my life-the Morris      mastermind took an especially <em>long</em> look at the      four husky sons he'd been afattenin', realized that perhaps      he could quit wasting money on rented horsepower,      and-in less time than it takes to say "the tinkling      of the trace chains"-put all four of us youngsters in      harness! </p><p>That's when I became a horse.<br />      Actually, each harness rig consisted solely of 15 feet of      half-inch rope tied into a loop, plus a three-foot stick      about two inches thick. Yet-in the years that      followed-my brothers and I used the primitive work      gear to transport a veritable forest into our woodlot. </p><p>To      shut one of his "steeds" into this harness, Father simply      used lark's head knots at opposite ends of the rope loop:</p><p>      He hooked one of these fastenings around the to-be-pulled      log, and the other hitch around the three-foot hauling      stick (called a "singletree" by workhorse handlers). Then      one-or two-of us dobbins would extend his arms      behind his back, take hold of the stick, and dig in his      hooves until something moved. (We horses pulled singly or      in tandem depending on the size of the log, the slope of      the terrain . . . and the degree of our exhaustion or      laziness.)</p><p> I detested that hard tree-toting work (I still      shudder like a horse with flies when I think of it), but I      <em>did</em> admire the versatility of the harness      arrangement. The lark's head knot-because its grip      increases under tension-squeezed a bundle of small      wood pieces together much more tightly than any      conventional tie could do ... yet could still be loosed      with ease. The singletree could be thrust vertically into      the ground and used as a lever whenever a particularly      heavy load had to be inched over difficult terrain.      And-of course-both separate components were      quite useful objects in themselves: The stick made a nice      walking cane between loads, and the rope could be hung up      as a swing . . . when we got the chance to indulge in such      tomfoolery! </p><p>All four of us horses spent a lot of time      "hooked up and hauling" over the years . . . until we each      grew old enough to set out for college (or some other      prolonged misadventure). In fact, "harness labor" became so      ingrained in us that-even to-day-we can't go      back home to visit without suspecting that Mother will ask      us to drag in some fuel for the wood stove (even though      these days she also has both electricity <em>and</em>      natural gas).</p><p> And sometimes-when I tell my      <em>own</em> children to take out the garbage and the      citified critters fall into paroxysms of self-pity-I      set the slowfoots down and retell (for the umpteenth time)      the story of my years as a workhorse. You know, from the      way those youngsters look at me during such episodes of      instructive nostalgia, I'm sure they believe a      <em>particular</em> portion of that horse remains with me      still.    </p>
