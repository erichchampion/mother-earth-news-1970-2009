            <hr />						<p><em>MOTHER's own Copthorne      Macdonald recently returned from an extended European trip.      During his travels, he attended the U.N. Conference of      Science and Technology for Development (UNCSTD) in Vienna .      . . the Non-Governmental Organizations Forum (NGO Forum)      held in the same city . . . and Britain's Community      Technology Festival (COMTEK). The following article is the      first of a series of reports from Cop on these attempts to      determine how technology (both hard and soft) can best meet      the needs of the world's people.</em>    </p>                        			<p>Just imagine for a moment that you're a government      official in a poor land ... a country where many babies      don't live to see their first birthday. Given the      opportunity, you'd certainly be willing to make a deal with      a multinational corporation to have that firm build a      pharmaceutical plant in your nation ... especially if the      company agreed to limit the plant's profits to a reasonable      level above its costs. After all, such an arrangement would      provide your people with a reliable supply of inexpensive      drugs ... which might help save some of those children from      dying, right?</p><p> Wrong! You see, the "fine print" in the      arrangement says that the "raw" chemicals used by the      pharmaceutical plant must be purchased from other companies      owned by the same corporation. Now you might have thought      the stipulation unimportant during the negotiations, but      the truth of the matter is that the supplier firms will      probably charge up to 1,000% more than the open market      price for the raw materials ... so the finished medicines      won't be inexpensive at all! </p><p>Unfortunately, this example      isn't some far-fetched, barely possible scenario. It's an      only <em>slightly</em> modified case history of one of the      many rip-offs perpetrated against developing countries by      multinational corporations. It was in the hope of      eliminating at least a portion of just such injustices-and,      in effect, of getting a technological "fair deal" from the      rich lands that are the home base for most international      corporations-that representatives of 120 have-not nations      banded together at the U.N. Conference of Science and      Technology for Development.</p>			<h3>SMALL CONCESSIONS (OR NONE AT ALL)</h3>			<p> Although the United States (as well      as many other developed countries) claims to be perfectly      willing to share its technology with poor nations, the fact      is that-in western lands, at least-the governments don't      often <em>own</em> much technology. Instead, such knowledge      is usually in the hands of large corporations . . . and is      only sold by the firms at their price and on their terms.</p><p>      The have-not countries that attended UNCSTD (they were      represented by a coalition called the Group of 77) hoped to      eliminate the unfairness that's a part of many transfers of      technology from wealthy lands to poor ones. However, their      initial proposal (which would have resulted in a binding      international agreement to eliminate the monopolistic and      exploitative practices of multinational corporations) was      defeated.</p><p> A second issue that concerned the impoverished      nations was the question of distribution of research and      development funds. The latest U.N. figures show that      international firms spend almost $100 billion each      year-worldwide-on R & D . . . but that only 3% of the      money is spent in the poor lands that could best benefit      from the extra income. The Group of 77 hoped to obtain a      commitment-on the part of rich nations-to use their      influence to raise this share to 7%. In the end, however,      the requested 4% increase was whittled down so severely      that have-not lands had to settle for less than a 0.5%      larger share of the research and development "pie". </p><p>Perhaps      the single most <em>positive</em> accomplishment of the      entire U.N. Conference was an agreement to establish a      worldwide information sharing system that would benefit      Third World people. The developed countries voted to      provide "the fullest possible access to available      information on the technologies, terms and conditions of      supply, and activities of transnational corporations and      enterprises in the fields of science and technology". The      agreement sounds wonderful, but such words as "possible"      and "available" tend to be hard to get a grip on. We can      only wait and see whether national governments will,      indeed, force multinational corporations to divulge any      significant information.</p>			<h3>ALTERNATIVE GATHERINGS</h3>			<p> While all the power at UNCSTD was in      the hands of the various national governments (which often      don't, as you know, consider the needs of their poorest      citizens), there were two "counter conferences" in Vienna      where the human side of technology could be-and      was-discussed. </p><p>The first was the Non-Governmental      Organization Forum, which provided a meeting place for      1,400 representatives of 360 organizations and information      networks concerned with technological development as it      relates to filling basic human needs. Among the groups      represented were the International Foundation for Science,      the Max Planck Institute, Friends of the Earth, the Sierra      Club, and our own New Directions Radio Network.</p><p> Of course,      the NGO Forum didn't have any appreciable influence on the      nationtonation proceedings that took place in UNCSTD, but      it <em>did</em> provide its participating organizations      with an opportunity to exchange ideas about how each one      can best influence its own government toward honesty and      responsiveness to the needs of the world's poor ... and how      the groups can <em>bypass</em> governments and work,      themselves, to solve specific human problems. </p>			<h3>THE ALTERNATIVE FORUM AND VIENNA'S "ECO-VILLAGE"</h3>			<p>The second of Vienna's "counter-conferences" was called the      Alternative Forum. It was the brainchild of a coalition of      Austrian groups and individuals-concerned with alternative      lifestyles, energy, etc.-who managed to talk Vienna's city      fathers into setting aside part of an urban park as the      site for a temporary "ecological village" (called      "Oko-Dorf").</p><p> The community was built in less than two      weeks-by a small number of people using scrap materials-and      it may not have been quite what Viennese officialdom had in      mind. Oko-Dorf did, however, provide a gathering place for      interested men and women from around the world.</p><p> In      addition, the ecological village was the site of a number      of informal workshops, organized by a group called      Community Action Europe. These courses were divided into      four basic groups of topics classified under the labels      "Earth", "Air", "Fire", and "Water".</p><p> The Earth group      wrestled with the problems of food, housing, health, and      alternative economic systems . . . Air dealt with      communications and organizations ... Fire centered on      energy . . . and Water discussed children and human      relationships in general.</p><p> Oko-Dorf was a place of      celebration and art, too. One evening, for example, the      Buffalo Child Society (a group of Cree Indians from western      Canada) put on a series of their traditional tribal dances.      On the following night, the Mullkraft Theatre from      Stockholm, Sweden-performed its "Energy Ballet": a mythical      tale that began with the original connection of fire and      hearth . . . then depicted the use of fire for      <em>destructive</em> purposes and the transformation of the      wheel of community into the wheel of industry. Such changes      the program warned-could result in tragedy for us all. </p><p>In      summary, a lot more was accomplished-and more helpful      knowledge changed hands-at the meetings <em>outside</em>      UNCSTD than <em>within</em> that United Nations gathering.      I'll detail some of the information ( <em>and</em> report      on Britain's Community Technology Festival) in the next few      issues of MOTHER.    </p>
