                <p>      <em>Relieve your aches and pains without the use of often      harmful drugs...</em></p>			      <h5 id="byline">by MICHAEL BLATE</h5>            <p>      Health care can often be a problem for folks who want to      move toward a more natural, stress-free, and independent      rural lifestyle. If your homestead is deeply buried in the      woods, for instance, what do you do when a health crisis      occurs? The usual options-rushing many miles to a      doctor, clinic, or drugstore . . . keeping a large stash of      medicine for who-knows-what emergency . . . or just      suffering while your body heals itself-are far from      attractive or practical. </p><p>Fortunately, there's at least one      therapeutic technique that can relieve some kinds of      discomfort almost instantly and is said to stimulate the      mind and body's own self-healing powers. The method is      known as G-Jo (pronounced "JEE-joh").</p><p> G-Jo means "first      aid" in Chinese, and the technique originated in the Orient      thousands of years ago. It's a primary form of finger      pressure acupuncture (or acupressure), and-with a      little reading and practice-you can learn enough G-Jo      to avoid much needless suffering and become more nearly      independent of doctors and drugs ... especially if your      lifestyle is already a healthful one.</p>			<h3>TO THE POINT</h3>			<p>There are two vital rules for using G-Jo.      The first is FIND THE RIGHT PRESSURE POINT. The specific      spots may be tricky to locate at first, and you must use      the <em>tip</em> of your thumb or forefinger-not the      pad or fleshy part-to probe the area of the <em>point      as deeply as you can</em> ... applying about 20 pounds of      finger pressure. Since these areas of pressure are only      about the size of a pinhead, you'll have to practice      locating them until you become familiar with their feel and      position. You'll know when you've found a pressure point,      though: It will announce itself with a "loud" twinge of      sensitivity, much like that associated with a pinched nerve      or a toothache.</p><p> The second important rule is STIMULATE THE      PRESSURE POINT PROPERLY. Here, again, the secret is      <em>deep pressure</em> . Massage the tiny spot with a      digging, goading motion ... again, using the <em>tip</em>      of the thumb or forefinger. If you have trouble applying      enough force with your finger, you can use the blunt end of      a felt-tipped marker or something similar. In severe cases,      you might have to continue applying pressure for as long as      several minutes, but 10 or 15 seconds of treatment is      usually enough to unblock the right control point and      relieve the problem completely or, at least, substantially      ease the symptoms.</p><p> Pressure points are usually duplicated      bilaterally, so-after you stimulate a spot on one      side of your body-you can simply repeat the operation      on the opposite side. You'll often find one more tender      than the other... and treating one side may      <em>relieve</em> a symptom, while stimulating the opposite      point may bring the discomfort <em>back</em> . (If that      happens, simply reapply pressure to the original side until      the symptom disappears again.) </p><p>There are several different      types of acupressure, but G-Jo is the most basic form. It's      designed to be used symptomatically ... that is, only when      symptoms manifest themselves, either from sources (such as      illness) within the body or as a result of accidental      injury. </p><p>The goal of G-Jo treatment is, of course, to      provide increasingly long periods of relief. However, if      you have to goad the points more than four or five times      during the day-or for more than several days in a      row-it's a good indication that you're using the      wrong points and/or that your problem is beyond the scope      of G-Jo ... and in such cases you should always seek      <em>professional</em> medical help.</p>			<h3>FEEL BETTER FAST</h3>			<p>Since there are more than 115 pairs of G-Jo      points on your body, finding just the <em>right</em> one(s)      can be a time-consuming job .. . even if you know where      they're all located. On the other hand, there are six      broad-acting, <em>easily found</em> points (which you can      quickly memorize) that will often stop an acute or      emergency symptom in seconds.</p><p> Each of the six pairs, which      are located on the lower arms and lower legs, can affect      large segments of the body. So- while applying      pressure to any one pair may not be the best treatment for      a specific symptom-it should bring enough relief to      make you quite comfortable (and will stimulate your      self-healing process at the same time).</p><p> As soon as you      notice a problem, stimulate whichever one of the following      basic pairs of points best controls that area. If your      symptom is <em>not</em> relieved satisfactorily, try      another pair of points. ( <em>Because</em> they are so      broad-acting, <em>any</em> one pair may relieve symptoms      usually controlled by another.) Then, when your symptom      returns-if it does-simply <em>restimulate</em>      the pair of points that best alleviated your discomfort.</p><p>      When you find the right point of control, several things      should happen: The most important, of course, is that your      discomfort (such as headache, indigestion, muscle sprain,      or any of the more than 250 disorders helped by G-Jo)      should be immediately relieved. In addition, there may be a      residual easing of tension throughout your whole system,      and perhaps a light flush of perspiration across your brow      or shoulders.</p>			<h3>I'D RATHER DO IT MYSELF</h3>			<p> The primary G-Jo point to control problems of the head and neck      is G-Jo No. 13 ... which is located on the top side of the      hand between the thumb and forefinger and snuggled deeply      in the fleshy webbing as if it didn't want to be disturbed.      You'll see why the point is so well protected when you find      it, as it'll be quite tender.</p><p> To locate this spot, push      your right thumb and forefinger together until the fleshy      mound appears between them on the top of the hand. Place      the tip of your left thumb on top of the mound, then relax      your right hand, keeping your left thumb in place. Now,      reach beneath the webbing with your left index finger and      place it in the right palm, make a pincher, and probe      deeply with the tip of your thumb. You should immediately      feel the characteristic twinge . . . but, if you don't,      just move your thumb tip back toward your wrist, between      the two bones (first and second metacarpals) until you find      the sensitive spot. (When using this-or      any-G-Jo point, it makes no difference which side of      the body you begin with ... just stimulate each one      identically.)</p><p> I've used G-Jo No. 13 numerous times to      relieve headaches and other head problems. In fact, it once      saved me a visit to the emergency room: In 1974-while      I was working on one of the chicken coops at my organic egg      farm in southern Florida-a 100-pound steel ladder      fell on my face, making a deep slice in the tip of my nose      and cutting into my upper gum as well. The pain was      intense, and I almost passed out.</p><p> However, I grabbed for my      left hand's pressure point and goaded it as deeply as I      could . . . then I did the same on the other hand and held      both points for almost a minute. The pain was immediately      eased, and even the bleeding stopped! When the symptoms      returned a few minutes later, I simply restimulated both      points and got the same relief.</p><p> In all, I pressed No. 13      about two dozen times the first day ... a few times less      often the second day ... and even less the third. After      that I no longer needed the "treatment". I didn't see a      doctor, get stitches, or use any drugs or medicine ... yet      the wounds healed quickly, cleanly, and with minimal      scarring. While I <em>don't</em> recommend such      self-treatment to anyone but a master of the G-Jo art, the      incident convinced me that-if necessary-I could      handle even relatively severe physical injuries ... and it      was a major turning point in my life.</p>			<h3>FROM HYPOGLYCEMIA TO HICCUPS</h3>			<p>The second major pressure point-G-Jo No. 4-can be found approximately two      inches (about the width of two thumbs) above the most      prominent crease of your wrist on the upper side (lateral      aspect) of the forearm ... in line with the middle finger.      It's found in a protected hollow (as are many important      G-Jo points) between the lower arm bones (the radius and      ulna). If you can't generate enough pressure with the tip      of your thumb, use the knuckle of your index finger to      probe for the point.</p><p> G-Jo No. 4 has major control over the      hand, arm, and shoulder. Gail, my partner, has also applied      it to relieve burns and scalds. And since she suffers from      "sugar allergy" (hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar), she      employs this point (as well as others) to quickly control      any negative emotional and physical effects that occur from      accidentally eating the wrong foods. G-Jo No. 4 is also      very effective in alleviating the pain of tennis elbow and      tension in the neck and shoulders. </p><p>G-Jo No. 10 is a      pressure spot that's sometimes taught in Western first aid      courses as a means to control bleeding, but it has a number      of other uses, too. The point is located directly beneath      G-Jo No. 4-between the tendons on the      <em>underside</em> (inner aspect) of the lower      forearm-again, in line with the middle finger and      about the width of two thumbs above the most prominent      crease of the <em>inner</em> wrist ... in the direction of      the elbow. </p><p>No. 10 is an important point for treating such      diverse symptoms as menstrual cramps, seasickness, or      hiccups ... but its primary use is to control asthma and      other problems of the chest area.</p>			<h3>POTENT POINTS</h3>			<p>While each of the three basic pressure      points already described may relieve as many as 40      distressed areas, none of them is more potent than G-Jo No.      9. This one is located about three inches (the width of one      of your hands) below the bottom edge of the kneecap.      There's a ridge of bone (the shinbone, or tibia) along the      front of the leg, and the pressure point is just alongside      that ridge (laterally, in the direction of the little toe),      between the shinbone and the front of the calf (or anterior      tibial) muscle.</p><p> You'll probably find a long, valleylike      depression that runs most of the length of your lower leg,      and it's in this depression that the point is found. Though      No. 9 is the most <em>difficult</em> of the six basic      points to locate, it assuages problems connected with all      areas from the stomach downward (the entire lower      <em>three-fifths</em> of the body), so it's well worth      searching out. It can be used to control both diarrhea and      constipation, and-when used in conjunction with G-Jo      No. 7 (see below)-the elusive point is a powerful      treatment for most any digestive problem.</p><p> G-Jo No. 7,      fortunately, is as easy to find as No. 9 is difficult to      locate. Simply measure the width of one hand-roughly      three inches-directly above the bulge of the inner      ankle (the medial malleolus). The tiny point lies just      behind-and almost touching-the shinbone. It's      actually <em>between</em> the shin and the calf (the flexor      digitorum longus), but since G-Jo points are located in the      skin or flesh-rather than the muscles or      bones-they tend to "float" a bit.</p><p> Nearly everyone      will be able to find this point-which works about      like No. 9- without much difficulty. My daughter uses      it to ease menstrual distress, and I've found that pressure      applied to No. 7 promptly reverses any feeling of nausea      and indigestion I might experience after overeating. </p><p>G-Jo      No. 5, the last of the six major pressure points, is a good      spot for lower-back-pain sufferers to memorize. To locate      it, simply probe the area behind the bulge of the outer      ankle (or lateral malleolus), and just in <em>front</em> of      the Achilles tendon. The point is found in the hollow or      soft, valleylike area, but may be a little off-center.</p><p>      Every member of my family has relied on No. 5 to get rid of      back pain at one time or another, and my son has used      it-along with point No. 13-to help relieve the      discomfort of a leg and ankle injury he received when he      fell while running last year. In short, the point is      excellent for many problems from the waist down, especially      those that occur along the back (posterior) part of the      body. It's also a good point for midwives-and women      who plan to use natural childbirth-to know. Point No.      5-alone, or with No. 13-helps alleviate labor      pains, speeds delivery, and reduces trauma ... but it      should only be used in cases where labor pains are severe      or when the delivery may be difficult.</p>			<h3>"FIRST, RELIEVE SUFFERING"</h3>			<p>Since G-Jo is a natural, drugless technique, it's as safe for treating children as      it is for adults ... one should simply apply less pressure      when goading the points on a child's more sensitive body.      My friend Gail, who teaches visually limited preschoolers,      uses acupressure regularly to ease many minor playground      injuries.</p><p> G-Jo is also a valuable first aid technique,      especially for use in emergencies. For example, I recently      came upon an auto accident and found a woman pinned in her      car, apparently suffering from a crushed chest. She was in      great pain and nearing a state of shock. With her      permission-and her husband's-I stimulated G-Jo      points No. 10 and No. 4. The woman's clenched face      immediately relaxed, her color brightened, and she said she      felt better. About that time the ambulance arrived, so I      don't know the final results of her accident ... but I      <em>did</em> prove to myself that a knowledge of G-Jo can      help any healer follow Buddha's dictate: "First, relieve      suffering." </p><p>However, while G-Jo is great for both acute and      emergency symptoms, it's not so effective for chronic      problems ... those which have been a part of the sufferer's      life for more than, say, several weeks, or those that seem      to reoccur with regularity. Simply stimulating the right      control points-even if it <em>does</em> temporarily      relieve a symptom-is, obviously, no substitute for      healthful living. Disease and discomfort often arise from      abuse of the body, and no true cure is possible until those      abusive factors (such as overly processed foods, or drugs)      are eliminated from one's life. </p><p>In short, while G-Jo can be      effective in limited or one-time use, it's not recommended      as a panacea or a full-time alternative to proper      professional help. And there are some people-most      notably, pregnant women (especially those beyond the third      month) and folks who suffer chronic heart problems      (primarily those who use a pacemaker or have had open-heart      surgery)-who should shun regular use of acupressure.</p><p>      G-Jo should also be <em>temporarily</em> avoided under      certain other conditions: Except in emergencies, it's best      to wait about four hours after taking any drugs,      medication, alcohol, or other intoxicants to use G-Jo. And      give yourself about half an hour after a hot bath, a full      meal, or physical work or exercise ... because the "primal"      energy (or the force that makes the heart beat) is too out      of balance to respond to G-Jo during those times.</p><p> The use      of all 115 pressure points, combined with improved diet and      attitudes, has helped me-at 40-to be healthier      than I've <em>ever</em> been before ... and my health seems      to be constantly improving, too! Since I've become      competent with G-Jo, I've used medication only once ...      I've seen no doctors or other health specialists ... and,      most important, I've been virtually free of suffering while      my body goes about its job of self-healing. I'm happier,      too, than I've ever been, because I have a profound sense      of confidence in (and awe of) the body/mind combination's      potentials and capabilities. <br />vIf you're willing to use a      little time to practice the technique-and to temper      your use of G-Jo with plain old common sense-I      believe the method can work for you, too!</p><hr />			<p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: You can obtain a free chart of your body's basic six      G-Jo points and many of their uses by sending a long (No.      10) self-addressed, stamped envelope to: The G-Jo      Institute, P.O.
