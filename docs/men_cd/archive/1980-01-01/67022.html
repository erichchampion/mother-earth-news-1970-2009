                  <p>      <em>Here's an exceptionally hearty treat for a cold winter      morning!</em></p>            <h5 id="byline"><em>by Janis Smith</em></h5>		    <p>      Brancakes are light-bodied bran pancakes with a very      distinctive and pleasing texture. I've always liked the      taste of bran, and decided, not long ago, to add it to my      favorite flapjack recipe for that reason alone. The      flavorful results were all that I'd hoped for ... but-of      course-bran has more to recommend it than good taste!    </p>    <p>      In fact, the healthful grain husks have gotten a lot of      attention lately as a source of food fiber (a substance      that's lacking in most folks' diets and often cited as a      preventive for bowel cancer). Furthermore, they're also      high in folic acid and some B vitamins.</p><p> To make six large,      nutritious brancakes, simply combine-in a bowl-1/3 cup of      whole wheat flour, 1/3 cup of bran, 2 teaspoons of baking      powder, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of oil (wheat germ      oil is especially good, if you have it), 1 egg, and 1 cup      of milk.</p><p> The mixture will be runny, but don't let that fool      you. Two tablespoons of brancake batter will swell up to a      six-inch-diameter flapjack soon after it hits the skillet.      (The oil in the mixture keeps the cakes from sticking and      helps hold them together.) However, if you prefer a denser      texture, you can use an extra egg. Sunflower seeds also      make a very tasty addition to the recipe. </p><p>Cook your      brancakes as you would regular pancakes ... about 2 minutes      on a side (at 325Â°F in your electric skillet or at      medium-high heat when you use a stovetop burner).</p><p> Serve'em      up with butter, honey, or your favorite topping . . . and      then watch 'em disappear!    </p><hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Our testers found that brancakes are      inexpensive . . . easy to prepare . . . and very tasty!      However, they also noted that the breakfast treats should      be eaten in moderation by folks who're not used to bran . .      . as these pancakes-like bran cereals or any        food containing a sizable proportion of the grain      husks-can have a laxative effect.    </p>
