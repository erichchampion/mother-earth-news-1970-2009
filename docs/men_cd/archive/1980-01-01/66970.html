            <hr />    <p>      Dr. Robert Nara, author of Money-by the Mouthful      and the subject of the Plowboy Interview in MOTHER NO. 56,      has recently completed a volume (entitled How to Become Dentally      Self -Sufficient)that spells out-step by step-his preventive      dentistry program (Oramedics). The following is an excerpt      from Dr. Nara's new book.    </p>				<p>Reprinted by permission    from <em>How to become Dentally Self-Sufficient</em> by Dr.    Robert O. Nara (with Steven A. Mariner), copyright Â© by    Oramedics international Press.</p>        <p>      Two substances have been handed down for generations as      folk. medicines: baking soda and common table salt. Claims      for the properties of these familiar chemicals range from      the ridiculous to the sublime: They've probably been      "known" to cure almost anything, at one time or another.    </p>    <p>      In your oral health medicine cabinet, these two can be used      for hygienic purposes as well as dental first aid. The      first use, hygiene, simply has both soda and salt doubling      as a dentifrice.    </p>    <p>      As a youngster, you probably experimented at one time or      another by mixing baking soda and vinegar. Remember the      reaction? The solution bubbled and boiled and fizzed:      Something was happening. Apparently vinegar and soda are      not overly compatible. Why is that? Well ... vinegar is      acidic, and soda is alkaline. Acid and alkali are at      separate ends of a scale ... they truly "don't get along".    </p>    <p>      Part of the disease process of odontosis takes place when      the germs ingest sugar and begin excreting acid. It is this      acid that begins the insult to tooth enamel which will      become, eventually, a cavity.    </p>    <p>      If you use soda as a dentifrice, you will no doubt create      that "soda-vinegar" reaction ... except on a scale so      small as to escape observation. In this, there aren't any      research figures we can supply ... no weighty documentation      is available. It is, instead, plain common sense. Soda and      acid are not compatible. Soda won't hurt your teeth and      gums ... it won't hurt you if you swallow a teaspoonful      (makes you burp) ... but it isn't going to do acid a whole      lot of good when it comes in contact with it. Conversely,      acid will hurt you in the teeth and gums. . . "it'll rot      yer teeth. "    </p>    <p>      Salt is sodium <em>chloride, which</em> is a significant      element in the physical makeup of the human body. The      "saline solution" used in many medical applications is      generally about point nine percent (0.9%) salt in water. It      is used, for example, as a base solution for injections: It      balances the osmotic action of the body fluids so the      injection does not disturb the normal balance of water      inside the body's cells at the area of the injection.    </p>    <p>      Saline solution (salt water) in any concentration where the      salt can be tasted will be a <em>hypertonic solution:</em>      It will draw water from the cells of tissue bathed in it. A      hypertonic condition in the mouth will instantly and      automatically cause the salivary glands to go into overtime      production. This is something to remember if you are      frequently in places where water is not available for      "normal" toothbrushing. A dry mixture of soda and salt is      not inconvenient to take along on a camping trip, for      example. Using this "dentifrice" without water is easy: The      mouth's water fountains will provide more than enough.    </p>    <p>      This capacity of salt-to act as a hypertonic and draw      water (fluids) from tissues-should be kept in mind      for another reason: When teeth "act up" and pain sets in;      there is often (perhaps usually) a buildup of fluids in the      area of the affected tooth. Wouldn't it make sense to use a      "medicine" which helped reduce this fluid pressure? Hand me      the salt, please ... I'm getting a toothache....    </p>
