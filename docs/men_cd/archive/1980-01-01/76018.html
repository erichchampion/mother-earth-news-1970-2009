                <hr />    <p>      <em>If you now operate-or have ever operated-a      successful home business that was inspired by an article      you read in MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or less) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"-you      started your venture. Because if your story can be fitted      into an upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES,      you'll receive [1] the warm satisfaction of knowing that      you helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy and      [2] a free two-year new or renewal subscriptions THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS (restricted) .</em>    </p><hr />    <p>      I was doing my best to support six children (on a very      meager salary) when I read "You Can Start Your Own      Publishing Business" on page 86 of MOTHER NO. 38. I've      always been an avid cook, and I've noticed that many mail      order advertisers charge outrageous prices for no more than      a handful of recipes. So I decided to put together a sizable      (and, I hoped, salable) culinary collection of my own.    </p>    <p>      My first step was to spend $50 on paper, printing, and      postage . . . and before long I'd come up with a monthly      newsletter called Honeysuckle, which contained not only      recipes, but also household hints, energy-saving      information, tips about livestock, monthly planting guides,      a kitchen metric system, tables of weights and measures,      caloric guides, crafts instructions, book recommendations      (frequently selections from Mother's Bookshelf), and      sometimes even poetry. On occasion, I also include recipes      for feeding groups of 100 or more . . . as well as short      profiles of some of the interesting people that I've met. </p><p>A      one-year's subscription to <em>Honeysuckle</em> is $15 . .      . and I've made a pledge that, once 1 reach my goal of      10,000 subscribers, each of my "charter members" will      receive an extra year of the newsletter free! I've made      every effort to keep the price reasonable, too, so that my      incorhe will be just enough to make ends meet (before      inflation moves the ends) . . . and my first year in      business has already brought in an average monthly profit      of $450!</p><p> Many of <em>Honeysuckle's</em> readers have      written to tell me that they save every issue of the      publication in order to pass them all down-along with their      collections of MOTHER to future generations. That's about      the best encouragement I could hope for from my      subscribers. </p><p>Thanks, MOM, for helping to make it happen!</p><p> A.      Rosan<br />      <em>Honeysuckle</em><br />      P.O. Box 112<br />      Ridgecrest, N.C. 28770 </p><p>I've been involved in the      handicrafts scene for about as long as I can remember, but      I wasn't aware of the moneymaking potential of my hobby      until recently . . . when I was enlightened by two letters      in MOTHER's Bootstrap Businesses column: Janet Ryan's piece      describing her macram6 business (MOTHER NO. 47, page 120)      and Susan Dworkin's write-up about making and selling wall      hangings (No. 55, page 125).</p><p> My particular specialties are      hand-spinning and knitting . . . so I let the shopkeepers      in my neighborhood know that I was interested in making      knitted items to sell on consignment. Several stores      promptly took me up on my offer, and I began creating      woolen goods in quantity ... some hand-spun and others made      from the supply of store-bought yarn that I already had. </p><p>I      knitted all through the long, cold winter evenings of my      first few months in business ... creating      easy-yet-intricate-looking patterns that would allow me to      earn at least $2.00 to $3.00 an hour. (I found      that-although I can make more money per hour from handspun      items than from the knitwear products I make with      commercial yarns-the latter products usually sell more      quickly than do their more expensive counterparts.) As my      business grew, I learned to watch for yarn sales and to      stock up on supplies when I came across bargains. Before      long, my enterprise had become a substantial source of      supplemental income. </p><p>I doubt that I'll ever make a fortune      in the knitting trade, but my home business is helping me      earn a living without subjecting me to the competitive      nine-to-five rat race . . . and that alone is worth a lot!</p><p>      Sally Young<br />      Boundary, Ark. </p><p>Three years ago my two partners and I      started Obviously Enterprises Ltd. with little more than      our imaginations and the inspiration we'd acquired from an      excellent article-"The Fine Art of Trash      Mongering"-that ran on page 12 of MOTHER NO. 6. </p><p>About      75 people live in our little valley year round, and a large      summer population migrates to the area, from Vancouver,      during the warm season. Consequently-when we read      MOM's junk-collecting idea-we figured we could do a      pretty good business in our locale. The seed money that we      invested in the enterprise totaled only $30: $5.00 for a      two week newspaper ad, $10 for licenses, and $15 for a      tankful of gasoline for our truck. In just a few weeks'      time, the inexpensive ad had attracted 15 customers . . .      and we promptly established the fees for our weekly trash      pickups: $6.00 per month for businesses, $5.00 for      families, and $2.00 for senior citizens. </p><p>Our first garbage      run proved quite profitable . . . as we took advantage of      the opportunity to collect a variety of recyclable      materials in addition to our regular fees. We accumulated      enough returnable bottles during that trip, for example, to      buy our second tank of fuel . . . and-not long      thereafter-my partners and I had a yardful of scrounged      items, including enough furnishings to completely      redecorate our home!</p><p> Much of our booty was acquired from      supplementary junk hauls (we carry off individual      truckloads of "throwaways" for $10 each). The spoils from      one of those jobs, for instance, included a hand water      pump, two shovel heads, and several column gas lights . . .      each of which brought in a tidy sum at the local flea      market. Car towing was also added to our list of services .      . . and junked vehicles began to pile up on our back five      acres. At the end of a year we'd accumulated 20 such      automobiles, which we stripped for both parts and scrap      metal. </p><p>This past year our garbage pickup service included      37 customers, and-at an average of $4.33 per client-the      business grossed about $160 per month. In addition, my      partners and I earned several hundred dollars per week from      scrounged goods that we sold at flea markets, to secondhand      stores, and to parts and scrap metal dealers . . . as well      as from the fees for our "extracurricular" hauling jobs.      Moreover, we've found that it's rarely necessary to pay      cash for items that we need or want, because they often      turn up- <em>free</em> -in our truckloads. </p><p>Obviously      Enterprises Ltd. has developed into quite a successful      business ... and we haven't received a single complaint      yet. After all, our prices are fair, the service is good,      and our company's pledge is always proudly displayed on the      tailgate of our truck: "Satisfaction guaranteed . . . or      double your garbage back!" </p><p>Tom Mesi<br />      Ouesnel, B.C., Canada </p><p>I'm a welder by trade, so when I      picked up a copy of MOTHER- NO. 31 and came across      "Homestead Welding" (page 39) and "How to Make Money With a      Welding Route" (page 42), my professional interest was      naturally aroused.</p><p> I already had some of the paraphernalia      that would be necessary in order for me to go to work for      myself, and I either traded for the rest of the equipment      or purchased it with cash I'd accumulated by selling tools      1 didn't need. I acquired torches, rods, a welding machine,      and a variety of other supplies . . . stocked my truck with      the equipment to establish a mobile welding unit ... and      started to travel, trading my skills for food, shelter,      tools, materials, and sometimes even cash.</p><p> During one of my      stopovers I met a physically disabled fellow. It seemed the      gentleman owned a store that he couldn't run .. . and we      agreed to work together for a while on a cooperative basis.      My family and I moved in behind the building (in a travel      trailer paid for with the earnings from my mobile      enterprise) . . . and I set up shop with my welding unit,      my stock of metal, and $300 in cash.</p><p> For the first few      weeks, customers were few and far between. But-as word of      our establishment spread-business began to pick up. Our      clients soon learned that we were willing to do all sorts      of odd welding jobs . . . such as repairing five-foot-tall      bird cages or rebuilding bulldozer buckets. In addition, I      accepted both swaps and cash for my work. Before long, I'd      accumulated enough capital to move on in search of new and      different opportunities. </p><p>At present I'm hiring out both my      mobile unit and my skills to a construction company . . .      for a whopping $350 a week! And I'm investing a large part      of the money 1 earn in a larger welding unit for my mobile      shop . . . in preparation for the time when I take my      business and my family on their next cross-country tour.</p><p> I      owe MOTHER a debt of gratitude for giving me my start as a      traveling welder. Perhaps my letter will help give someone      else that first big boost toward a self-reliant lifestyle!</p><p>      W.R.E.<br />      Florida </p><p>William Ruttencutter's home business idea -as      described in "Dig and Sell Native Trees", MOTHER NO. 56,      page 154really is a moneymaker. I'd noticed a number of      nicely shaped arboreal specimens growing on some unused      business acreage in my community, so-when I discovered Mr.      Ruttencutter's article in MOTHER-I became convinced that I      could make a go of a tree-selling enterprise. Since I      already owned a pickup truck, as well as some digging and      pruning tools, my first step was to obtain permission to      remove the saplings I'd spotted.</p><p> I decided-from the      beginning-to dig only those trees (such as maple, oak, and      ash) that I could readily identify in the bud stage . . .      and I made it a practice to select specimens with trunks      measuring 2-1/2" in diameter or less. My rates were set at      $10 to $15 for each 1 " to 2" tree and $20 to $30 per      2-1/2" tree . . . less than half the amount charged by the      majority of local nurseries. Then-to boost my sales      further-I invested a few dollars in an ad in a local      magazine and circulated a number of handwritten promotional      leaflets. </p><p>I planted several trees on an unused portion of      my five-acre farm, so that customers would be able to come      and make their own selections ... and before long my      part-time tree-selling venture had turned into a lucrative      enterprise. Last year, for example-though I was teaching      full time-the business brought in a whopping $600 during my      spring vacation alone! Moreover, I discovered that trees      make wonderful barter merchandise: I've swapped ash and red      oak for galvanized roofing for my barn addition, and-on one      occasion-I even gave an ash tree to a local attorney in      exchange for his drawing up a family will for me!</p><p> I can't      deny that digging and selling trees is exhausting and      exacting work . . . but the exercise, income, and feeling      of self-sufficiency that I've gained as a result of my      labor simply can't be beat!</p><p> P.S.<br />      Ohio    </p>
