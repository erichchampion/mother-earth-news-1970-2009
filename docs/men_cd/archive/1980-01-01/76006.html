        <p>Here's a simple-to-build device that will enable you to construct all the heatcatching fins you'll need for most any homemade solar water heater ... out of free-for-the-gathering tin soda or soup cans! (Actually, even if you decide to make your sheeting out of copper, you'll still want to use our research staff's latest invention- MOTHER's Fin Press -to help you establish the maximum heat-transferring. surface contact between your water pipes and your collector's fins.)</p><p>Until now, folks either soldered their copper water piping directly onto a flat collector sheet, made a V-notch "trough" for the pipework with angle iron, or hired a machinist to make some conduit-hugging semicircular grooves in the back plating. Unfortunately, the first pair of techniques produce very little contact between the two metals (so a lot of heat gathered by the flat sheets never gets to the water pipes), while the last approach works fine ... but is dang expensive!</p><p>Well, MOTHER's Amazing Fin Press was invented to solve that inefficiency versus-cost dilemma. The bottom section of this two-piece unit consists of a seven-inch length of 3/8" copper pipe (or 1/2" wooden dowel) that's been set- to a depth of slightly less than half its diameter-into a side-walled block. The top piece is little more than another block that has been grooved to fit over the baseboard's projecting pipe, To work the fin shaper, just position a flat, precut piece of copper or tin on the base, put the cap over it, and push down. Presto! You have one grooved fin ready to cradle a bit of collector pipe!</p><p>MOTHER's Fin Press can be made in only a few minutes out of scrap pipe and lumber bits, and is simplicity itself to construct. In fact, the accompanying "Fin Form" illustration should be pretty much self-explanatory ... except for the following two details: [1] To make the top press's central groove, handsaw a few starting notches, dig out the basic trough with an inexpensive Stanley Surform round file, and finish shaping the "ditch" with sandpaper. [2] If you don't wish to duplicate our cap's attractive three-piece handle, a short piece of 2 X 4-nailed across the top board-will provide the needed structural reinforcement.</p><h3>HOW TO MAKE AND ATTACH TIN FINS</h3><p>To turn free soup or soda cans into solar collector fins, just cut both the lids and the end rims off your scrounged cylinders with an electric-or manually-cranked, wall-fastened-can opener (hold the tins in a horizontal, rather than vertical, position when you do this). Then-using steel wool or a propane torch -buff or bum off the metal's protective coating. Cut each can down the middle, trim the sheet to a flat 5-1/2" X 6" shape ... and press it.</p><p>When you're ready to secure a fin to some pipe, just lay the shaped tin on two fireproof boards (or blocks, or bricks) placed side by side with a pipe width's space between them. Nestle the fin's curved center section into the gap, set your collector pipe into position, hold It in place with any heavy nonflammable -weight (to increase sheet-to-pipe contact), and solder the two metals together. Add more fins to your pipe-by laying out the grooved sheets, weighting, and soldering-until you've completed your platemaking ... then buff off any extra flux along the length of the pipe.</p><p>When all that's done, you'll have finished a crucial (and often the most expensive) step of your home-designed solar hookup ... and the cost for all your collector's fins will be a grand total of zero dollars and zero  cents!</p>

[1] Slice open a ""beheaded"" tin cylinder and trim the metal to size. [2] Place the sheet between your fin shaper's cap and base ... and press! [3] Then simply pull out the grooved metal, and ... [4] solder the finished fin to your copper collector pipe.
