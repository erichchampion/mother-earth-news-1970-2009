                    <p>      -----------------------------------------------------    </p>        <p>      <em>As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over      again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER'S      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28739. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we all can read what      the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>    <p>      I've cleared 1-1/2 acres of alder bottom for my gardens,      but now I'm faced with the task of removing the deep-rooted      stumps. Is there a way to get rid of them without bringing      in heavy equipment? I've seen bulldozers at work, and they      absolutely destroy the soil.    </p>    <p>      Twenty-odd years ago, we faced the same problem that you      describe: a piece of cut-over land <em>filled</em> with      tree and brush stumps. We simply cut all growth on the plot      to ground level and then mulched <em>heavily</em> with      rotted hay. In the course of a few years, the stumps had      rotted out and the land was clear. This technique provided      us with an alternative to bulldozers, and prepared raw land      for a successful blueberry plantation. You'll find a full      description of how we did it in Chapter 8 of our book.      <em>Continuing the Good Life</em> (available for $9.93 from      any good bookstore or-for the same price plus      95 cents shipping and handling-from Mother's      Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina      28739).    </p>    <p>      I was very disappointed by your advice concerning pets      (MOTHER NO. 56). I've been a vegetarian for 11 years . . .      but I have two cats. I don't see animals as higher or lower      than I, though I'm happy to care for them. (Actually, it's      in the realm of probability that <em>we</em> could      reincarnate on a planet where our existence will depend on      whether or not <em>other</em> beings choose to feed and      shelter <em>us</em> !)    </p>    <p>      Besides giving me more love than do many of the humans I      know, my pets make me laugh . . . and laughter is, I think,      one of life's great gifts. I know that you're in a position      to reach a lot of people. So please, won't you help      encourage others to provide homes for some of our abandoned      animal friends?    </p>    <p>      As a last note ... I share your concern about feeding meat      to <em>any</em> living thing. There are, however, recipes      available for several vegetarian pet foods: Mother's      Bookshelf offers <em>The Healthy Cat and Dog Cookbook</em>      by Joan Harper ($2.25 plus 95 cents shipping and handling)      . . . which includes a number of such healthful formulas      for this purpose.    </p>    <p>      It's not that we don't enjoy or love animals . . . domestic      and wild. In fact, we find all beasts interesting, lovable,      and often exciting to have around. But we don't think they      should be subservient hangers-on . . . nor should humans be      their nursemaids. If a sheepdog assists the shepherd to      perform his daily round of duties, it earns its keep and      can be a self-respecting being.    </p>    <p>      But a pet that exists to be fondled and fed is a parasite,      not a social asset. Parasitism is a highly questionable and      socially disadvantageous practice . . . both to the host      and to the obsequious dependent.<br />      What is your opinion about "herbal" remedies, such as      medicinal teas? If you use them, what are your favorites?    </p>    <p>      We apply crushed comfrey root as a poultice on wounds or      blemishes, and the juice from <em>Aloe vera</em> leaves for      the same purpose. We drink chamomile, equise-turn, and      rose-hip teas for their health-giving properties.    </p>    <p>      Our friend Juliette de Bairacli Levy, in her <em>Herbal      Handbook for Everyone</em> , covered the subject in great      detail. Unfortunately, the book has gone out of print,      but-should you be able to find a copy at a library or      used book shop-I'm certain you'd find it very helpful      (as are other volumes by Juliette).    </p>    <p>      I'd like to know what kind of household products you use      for everyday cleaning. All the brands in the stores carry      "warning" and "caution" labels. I'm interested in finding      some natural alternatives to such poisonous chemicals,      which would be safe for our environment and for the people      who use them. Do you have any suggestions?    </p>    <p>      We use Shaklee's organic products, which are biodegradable      and phosphate-free. A gallon of the firm's      highly-concentrated basic cleaner, for example, lasts for      years. One teaspoon in a gallon of water can be used for      dishes and pots and pans . . . while one teaspoon in a      <em>quart</em> of water is good for kitchen and bathroom      appliances, tiles, enamel surfaces, floors, and woodwork.      (The company's catalog can be obtained from Shaklee      Products, Dept. TMEN, 1900 Powell Street, Emeryville,      California 94608.)    </p>    <p>      I became acquainted with you by means of articles in      MOTHER, books, and word-of-mouth. I would really like to      come and work with you ... as I want so much to learn more      about organic, low technology gardening.    </p>    <p>      I have, in the past, apprenticed at Son-newald with the      LeFevers, who were very helpful to the many they reached.      However, I found that the learning process-in      <em>that</em> situation-was often interrupted because      we would frequently have to stop what we were doing to let      someone else work on the same project for a while.    </p>    <p>      Of course, I don't know whether you're in need of help. If      not, perhaps you could tell me of other East Coast organic      gardeners who would like to have apprentices. I love to      work hard and would be a willing helper.    </p>    <p>      After thousands of people dropped in on us each year      wanting to learn or "to help" ... we had to get out a form      letter that reads something like this: "We're glad that      you're interested in our way of life. Since the publication      of our book <em>Living the Good Life</em> , hundreds have      asked whether they could visit our farm for a summer,      month, week, day, or hour. We would like to see you all,      but this creates problems. If we turn from self-sufficient      homesteading to operating a school, a guesthouse, a      restaurant-or any such institution-we'll be      giving up our good life and going into business!    </p>    <p>      "We prefer to continue to live in our simple homestead way,      allowing time for our writing. . . which we tackle in the      mornings. We might see visitors-by      arrangement-between 3:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon,      but our mornings are wholly our own.    </p>    <p>      "We're sorry not to be more hospitable, but too many      visitors would keep us from necessary consecutive work at      several new books, which we're determined to finish. Thank      you for your consideration in helping us continue to live      the good life."    </p>    <p>      If you're serious in wanting work as an apprentice, write      Chaitanya York of Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners      Association, Hallowell, Maine 04347 . . . he'll link you up      with organic gardeners in this state who can use helpers.    </p>
