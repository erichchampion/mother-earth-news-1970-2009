                 <h5 id="byline">      by PHYLLIS M. LETELLIER    </h5>                 <p>      It was the same old story. USDA pamphlets recommended one      nest for every five layin' hens. I had a dozen of the      "girls", and the only commercially available nests were      huge metal banks of ten compartments apiece. I wouldn't      have needed that many even if I could have afforded them.    </p>    <p>      So I decided to do-it-myself. After all, I figured a      chicken nest couldn't be too awfully difficult to put      together. My survey of the readily available materials soon      convinced me that cardboard boxes-free from my      friendly neighborhood supermarket-would be "just what      the doctor ordered".    </p>    <p>      Of course, I tried a number of experiments before I got my      nest designs "just right". In fact, one of the lessons I      learned during this trial-and-error period is that chickens      don't necessarily <em>agree</em> upon one standard size and      shape of container to lay their eggs in . . . each breed      has its own preferences.    </p>    <p>      The closest thing I've found to a "universally acceptable"      box size happens to be the one that supermarkets generally      receive their egg deliveries in, In the case of these      "nests", at least, I know the answer to the old riddle      about "which came first".    </p>    <p>      Regardless of what size crates you choose (that is, which      ones your chickens pick for you), the cardboard nests are a      snap to construct.    </p>    <p>      First, cut a nine-inch circular doorway about two inches      from the end of one of the "long sides" of the box. I find      that a round hole is less likely to tear out than a square      opening would be.    </p>    <p>      Then, since hens will peck at any loose edges that they      find until the box is a wreck . . . you'll have to cover      the cut border of the hole inside and out. A simple way to      do this is to "buttonhole" the opening with small pieces of      masking tape. Stick 'em to the inner wall of the crate      first, pull 'em over the lip of the hole, and then attach      'em to the outer surface. It takes a little longer if you      overlap each sticky strip with the next one, but the result      will hold up well enough to be worth your trouble. All of      those little "radius" tapes, of course, will leave a      regular sunflower of ends around the opening. I cover the      "petal tips" of this "flower" with longer strips of      adhesive, which creates a sort of lumpy circle around the      hole itself. This process can be seen pretty clearly in the      accompanying photo.    </p>    <p>      Once the hole's diameter is well covered, all of the flaps      on the interior and exterior of the container should be      glued or taped in place. The idea, of course, is to smooth      all the box's surfaces so much that there'll be no "peckin'      edges" left anywhere on the container.    </p>    <p>      Hens like a "step" in front of their nests, so I try to      stack my cartons so that they present a staircase of      however many levels I need. Most chickens seem perfectly      satisfied with a two-layer structure . . . if the bottom      nests are set on something that keeps them six inches or so      off the ground.    </p>    <p>      My Leghorns, however, like their beds higher. In fact, when      I tried to get them to accept the usual low nests, they      responded by eating any eggs they found in them. As a      result, the Leghorns now have a separate "apartment" on a      shelf above the rest of the hens' "rooms".    </p>    <p>      I bed my boxes with barley straw-just because it's      the only thing I have at hand-but it does wear out      quickly, and has to be changed regularly.    </p>    <p>      Nest maintenance couldn't be easier, though. I've never had      a set (even under a leaky roof) last less than a year. At      that point they should be sterilized Oust burn 'em up and      build new ones) anyway.    </p>    <p>      All in all, I've found my "egg boxes" to be very      worthwhile. They're cheap, the hens like them, and they      provide me with a flexibility that the store-bought metal      products just can't match. For instance, I had one old      biddy that would not lay her eggs anywhere but on top of      the boxes, only to have the potential omelets fall to the      floor and break. It took me three tries to modify a      cardboard box into an enclosure that <em>she'd</em> use . .      . and the solution turned out to be a "tunnel", with holes      on both sides.    </p>    <p>      She and I would have been flat out of luck if our only      choice had been a wall full of galvanized commercial nests,      wouldn't we?    </p>
