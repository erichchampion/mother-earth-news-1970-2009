        <p>In issue No. 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts regarding one of mankind's better ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced our stillstanding offer. Anyone (and that means. you!) who sends us a short (200 words or less) account of an actual barter that's good enough to print will receive-as the folks on the following pages have-a twelve-month subscription (or extension of same) to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>. THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, Inc. P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739</p><p>No matter how simple you try to keep your lifestyle, you end up accumulating lots of "excess baggage" throughout the years. My back room, for instance, recently housed a collection of musical instruments, none of which any longer held any interest for me. On the other hand, I did long to learn to play the acoustic guitar, but couldn't scrape up the 200plus dollars I found I would need to buy one.</p><p>After trying to sell the instruments I had outright and realizing how little cash they'd bring in, I figured it was time to try MOTHER's advice: If you can't buy, barter!</p><p>So I began my tour of every local music store I could find. One manager was looking for a sax In good condition to sell to a young student, and I walked in at the perfect moment. He offered me a good guitar for the sax, and a case in exchange for my banjo. On top of that, the bass amp I used to have went for an Appalachian dulcimer that my wife is currently learning to play.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">We now spend our time "making beautiful music together" . . . and it all happened without a penny exchanging hands.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Jim Jordan Glenmoore, Pa.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Despite the high cost of clothing these days, some acquaintances of mine and I have found a simple way to swap old clothes for "new", beat rising prices, and get together with friends at the same time l</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">At every change of season, we each simply sort through our clothing and set aside the things we no longer wear.

How? By putting on quality plays with those other artists . . . and allowing local farmers to at tend the performances in exchange for fresh produce. The idea was simple and worked extremely well: The actors were able to feed themselves and practice their art, and the neighboring countryfolk were provided with good entertainment for their bartered farm produce (the only thing they had an excess of in those hard times).</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">The Barter Theatre exists today in Abingdon, Virginia and Old Dominion State farmers are still enjoying quality drama-at Barter's Playhouse and the Children's Theatre-in exchange for fresh farm produce.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Thank you, Robert Porterfield l You've proven that barter is a viable way to exchange our goods and services and avoid the clutches of the established economic system.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Dennis W.

My only transportation then was a ten-speed bicycle badly in need of repair, and I had neither the finances to have the work done, nor the knowhow to do It myself. So I struck up a bargain with a fellow student who had the tools and ability that I lacked: My bargaining classmatewho was tired of the usual dining hall fareagreed to make the necessary repairs on my bike in exchange for some good, homecooked meals.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Today the bicycle is still working great, and the friendship which developed over those meals is going strong1 I've continued to swap whenever possible since those college days, and I frequently enjoy the special pride that a good barter brings . . .

Since I knew that-only days before-she had admired a picture frame I'd made, I naturally offered to swap her the four frames that she'd decided she needed for that old pile of siding. My neighbor accepted, of course, and the wood (as I'd suspected) turned out to be chestnut ... a rare and expensive when one can find it-variety of hard wood.
