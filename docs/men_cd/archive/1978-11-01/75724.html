                   <p>      <em>If you now operate-or have ever operated-a      successful home business that was inspired by an article      you read in MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or less) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"-you      started your venture. Because if your story can be fitted      into an upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES,      you'll receive [1] the warm satisfaction of knowing that      you helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy and      [2] a free two-year new or renewal subscription to THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>'.</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      I just had to write and thank you . . . because good news      is always such fun to share.    </p>    <p>      Back in Issue No. 48 (page 74), MOTHER ran an article      called "Stained Glass", which really got me thinking about      making my own such articles . . . since I'd always loved      stained glass but could never afford to buy it.      And-as luck would have it-the day after I read      MOTHER's write-up, I received a circular in the mail      announcing our community's local adult education classes      ... which featured-to my surprise-a course in      stained glass craft!    </p>    <p>      I immediately enrolled in the class, diligently practiced      what I was taught, and quickly learned to produce some      beautiful stained glass pieces. Then I became involved in a      class project using both stained glass and pressed flowers,      and it was this that started me on the way to my present      moneymaking venture.    </p>    <p>      I soon began to experiment on my own a bit and presently      developed some simple designs which attractively combined      the stained glass and pressed flower materials I'd been      using. And before I knew it, my designs were selling and      shops were beginning to take an interest. Now my      handicrafts are available from three local gift stores: Two      buy my merchandise outright, the third purchases only on      consignment . . . and recently a fourth shop has asked me      to create a design exclusively for that establishment.    </p>    <p>      If ever there's a lull in the shop sales, I keep right on      producing . . . and-as a result-I now have a      large enough supply of my wares to display for sale at      various arts and crafts fairs. I brought MOTHER with me to      the last fair I attended . . . to read just in case I found      sales to be slow. But-as it turned out-I hardly      had time to look through her at all: Not only did my      creations sell well, but-with my issue of MOTHER      clearly in view-I was kept mighty busy, to boot,      meeting fellow fans of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) !    </p>    <p>      In the two short months since I first set my part-time      enterprise into operation, I've grossed a total of over      $1,000 ... a figure which has more than covered all my      business expenses, beginning with the fee for the stained      glass course I took some six months back. I began my little      business with no real artistic background whatsoever . . .      but soon found that small ideas just naturally flourish      when you're involved in a project that you really love.    </p>    <p>      At present, I can hardly keep pace with the demand for my      stained glass/flower creations. And it business keeps      booming as it has been of late, who knows ... my family's      fondest dream-to live in a solar-heated underground      home-could very soon become a reality!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pat Uyeda<br />      Port Washington, Wis.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'm a teacher in Missouri's public school system, which      leaves my summer months free to tend my family's one-acre      homestead. So recently, when my wife and I decided to add      onto our acreage in an effort to establish a berry farm, we      knew we'd have to think of a way to earn the necessary down      payment in my "idle" summer season. I wanted a job which      would leave me independent and free from too rigid a time      schedule ... and then I thought of MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Several articles came immediately to mind: MOTHER's      write-ups on starting a lawn mowing business in Issue No.      46 (page 81) and Issue No. 48 (page 92) and an article in      MOTHER NO. 32 (page 24) on hauling with a pickup truck.      These were just the thing for me, so I quickly surveyed my      assets and calculated my initial investment. I already      owned a pickup truck, riding mower, push mower, and a      variety of other necessary hand tools for yard work. This      left only the $16 cost of a one-month newspaper ad to      supplement the various free advertising sources I had      already put to use around town.    </p>    <p>      Next came the waiting ... would anyone answer the ads? You      bet! And I've been doing lawn care ever since. A typical      urban yard mowing brings in an average fee of $4.75 to      $6.00 . . . and I've cleared several rather overgrown yards      at a charge of $40 to $50 a day!    </p>    <p>      We've found, too, that hauling combines easily with the      lawn care business. It's a good way to fill the few      yardwork lulls . . . and quite often those who call for      mowing end up needing a hauler too. We charge $12 a pickup      load and frequently receive gratuities in the form of items      that we find in the trash which other people have thrown      away as "junk".    </p>    <p>      So you're responsible-MOTHER-for giving us not      one bootstrap business, but two . . . and for us that great      combination is bringing in the extra cash we need to buy      that berry-raisin' land!    </p>    <p>      <strong>David C. Hinze<br />      Rolla, Mo.</strong>    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's article "We Call 'Em Dough Babies" in Issue No. 48      (page 33) had quite a creative influence on me. I was in      the market for a way to make some extra money that would      require little or no initial outlay of cash . . . but It      seemed that a good many folks in my area had already cashed      in on dough-baby craft. Reading MOTHER's article, however,      started my imaginative wheels a-grindin' . .. and before I      knew it, I had become an "egger": a person who draws on      eggs.    </p>    <p>      I started my little artistic operation with a very simple      process: First I pierced a pinhole in the top of an egg      (the smaller end) and a hole just large enough to fit over      a 16-gauge wire in the other end. Then I emptied the hen      fruit by squeezing air into it with a 3-cc syringe . . .      and then filled the syringe with water to thoroughly rinse      out the inside of the shell. (Much of the work of the      syringe can be replaced by its no-cost standby, "ye old      mouth" . . . but your aching jaws may pay the price.) Next      I cleaned the outside of my egg (the store-bought product      can be finger washed, but fruit fresh from the hen will      require the rub of a soft toothbrush) . . .because if      properly cleaned-both inside and out-the ovoid      canvas will cause no problem of odor at all.    </p>    <p>      When the shell had dried out thoroughly, I set it      upright-through its bottom hole-on a 16-gauge      wire taped to my work table . . . and began to practice      drawing on its rounded surface with an ordinary writing      pen. Soon, however, I discovered the indispensability of a      rapidograph pen and purchased a $12 Koh-i-noor with the      smallest available point (4 X 0) .. . for detailed      illustration. Now I start out my designs with the      rapidograph and carefully fill in the drawings with shades      of water colors and/or acrylic-tipped pens.    </p>    <p>      When the design is drawn, I seal the egg's top pinhole with      gesso (easily applied with a toothpick) and mix up a      polymer (EnviroTex) which I paint onto the egg and let dry      for 6 to 12 hours.    </p>    <p>      This adds a super-high gloss to the shell and protects it      as well .. . leaving the egg with a shiny sturdiness.    </p>    <p>      My repertoire of designs includes a different illustration      for every month of the year, plus a varied assortment of      other decorations ... some with just pictures and others      with sayings as well. And every year I plan to change my      patterns, making each of my eggs something of a collector's      item.    </p>    <p>      I price my elaborate hen fruit-depending upon both      the amount of work I've put into each one and whether I'm      selling it to an Individual or to a store-at anywhere      from $3.00 to $5.00 apiece. I've found that the decorated      shells sell quickly in craft stores as well as in      department stores, gift shops, and art galleries. (A good      way to get your eggs displayed is to let shops know that      you're willing to place your handicraft on consignment.)    </p>        <p>      Eggcraft naturally sells quickest during the Christmas and      Easter seasons . . . but my creations do very nicely      throughout the rest of the year as well. In my first seven      months as an egger-in which I did not pursue the      enjoyable pastime nearly as avidly as I might have-I      earned a total of over $600.    </p>    <p>      On the whole, I've kept my business on a very small scale,      dealing only with a handful of stores in one city. But with      a desire to expand, I know for a fact that the eggcraft      business could bring in a good deal more than just spending      money!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lynea S. Weatherly<br />      San Antonio, Texas</strong>    </p>    <p>      When I read "A Small Discovery" in MOTHER NO. 49 (page 97),      I became convinced that people will give away anything . .      . so I decided to get in on the act. And since our local      weekly advertising paper has a policy of giving free space      to noncommercial advertisers who are buying or selling an      item for less than $50 ... that's where I began. My first      step was to take out an ad that read: "WANTED: Free      Volkswagen . .." (on the off-chance that I'd get one which      t could convert to electric power), and I tacked onto the      end of the notice a request for refrigerators, air      conditioners, and other such items.    </p>    <p>      Well-as it turned out-I didn't get my      Volkswagen . . . but that's just about the only thing I      wasn't given! The first day after I placed the ad, I got a      washing machine, an air conditioner, a lawn mower, and a      horde of other appliances. And since then I've been offered      a deep freeze, two refrigerators, a lawn cart, a gas stove,      sever al televisions, a good deal of furniture, and some      lumber (many of these items in excellent shape) . . . and      on occasion, I've even been offered cash for hauling      something away.    </p>    <p>      Before long, of course, my lawn began to look like a      junkyard, and I decided I'd better do something about it      fast. Thus my Freebie Appliance business was born .. . In a      little college town with a ready market for "castoffs".      From the beginning I made it a policy to try not to refuse      anything I'm offered, because you can never tell when      something might turn out to be useful. A local fix-it shop      takes unrepairables off my hands to use for parts ...      and-besides-it seems the least I can do is to      haul off a few lemons in return for all the really nice      things I continually obtain for free.    </p>    <p>      Once, for example, I was given an air conditioner by an      elderly lady who claimed it made a funny noise. When I got      the machine home, I found it to be flawless ... not a sound      that didn't belong. I sold that appliance for a whopping      $60 . . . not a bad price for the hauling time I'd invested      in it.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, my business has turned out to be      self-perpetuating: Customers frequently become donors, and      donors often become customers. On one occasion, I hauled      off a really trashy refrigerator for a man who offered to      service my pickup truck-in exchange-if ever      needed. He asked that I keep my eye out for a working      fridge for under E50 to replace the one he'd given me ...      and I had one to sell him within a week.    </p>    <p>      This Freebie Appliance business of mine is still just      getting under way ... but so far It's cost me only the use      of my $75 pickup truck (a love story all its own) and $1.25      here and there to advertise in the paper those Items I sell      for over $50.    </p>    <p>      So if you need a few bucks and you've got some spare time .      . . try out a little ad like mine: "WANTED Free for the      Hauling: Used Refrigerators, Air Conditioners, and Other      Major Appliances." And if you drop me a line, I'll be glad      to answer any questions <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: If you write to      Al, please include $1.00 to cover postage and processing      costs]</em> and if anyone out there has a Volkswagen he or      she wants to give away . . .    </p>    <p>      <strong>Al Andersen<br />      The Green Mailbox<br />      RR 2,<br />      Ames, Iowa 50010</strong>    </p>    <p>      After teaching biology for almost nine years, my      "retirement" to motherhood was beginning to make me a      little restless. I had explored the earthworm and frog      raising businesses . .. but had decided against them      because of the initial outlay of cash that would be      necessary.    </p>    <p>      And then-as fate would have it-my husband and I      subscribed to MOTHER ... and received Issue No. 50. I'd      soon read "We Homesteaded an Island" by David Vanderswaag      (page 84) and knew just what I wanted to do. David's wife      Cindy had found a way to earn the little "cash money" that      she and her husband needed to run their homestead ...      writing a weekly "Leisure Time" column for their local      newspaper.    </p>    <p>      So I set out to strike up a deal with one of our area      newspapers ... and before long, the arrangement was made. I      bought a $10 garage-sale typewriter (which is still      performing beautifully) . . . and now you'll find my      column, weekly, on the farm page of our local paper. It      includes everything from sunflowers, carob, and natural      birthday parties to American Indians, creating wildlife      habitats, and our 40-family natural food co-op. And once      again, I'm using my science background as I research data      for articles on plants and animals.    </p>    <p>      Since I was already a photography buff, it's been easy,      fun, and lucrative to provide photos with each of my      articles too. The paper furnishes and develops the film I      use and-as an added bonus-returns the negatives      to me each week.    </p>    <p>      My monthly paycheck comes in pretty handy...and I      thoroughly enjoy the weekly writing challenge. So, a tip of      the hat to the Vanderswaags and to MOTHER . . . for a      little diversion from daughter Katie, from the chickens,      ducks, horses, dogs, gardening, washing, cleaning, and      cooking, and from all those other wonderful things that are      part and parcel of the joys of rural living.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marcia Ward<br />      Urbana, Ohio</strong>    </p>
