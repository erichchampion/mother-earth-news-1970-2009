                    <hr />    <p>      Not all of us have enough artistic and shop skills (or      money) to allow us to give our friends hand-tooled leather      belts, macram√©d wall hangings, hammered silver      bracelets, knitted sweaters, wooden toys, or other "I made      it myself" gifts this Christmas. But anyone who can cook      can whip up a "24 carrot" present or two for most of the      special folks on his or her gift list.    </p>        <h3>      CARROT PUDDING    </h3>    <p>      Mix together one cup of grated raw carrot, one cup of      grated raw potato, one fresh egg (optional), one cup of      ground or grated suet, one cup of liquid honey, one cup of      washed raisins (optional), one teaspoon of salt, one      teaspoon of baking soda, one teaspoon of cloves and/or      nutmeg, and one-half cup of bread flour. Continue mixing      all these ingredients together until they form a spoonable      dough (if it's not soft enough, add a bit of fruit juice or      water . . . if it's too soft, stir in a little more flour).    </p>    <p>      Next, grease the inside of several recycled jam jars or      tins and fill the containers three quarters full of the      pudding (you must leave room for expansion, so the jars      won't burst). Close the containers very tightly, set them      on a piece of wire mesh or a wire rack in a large kettle,      and add enough water to cover their lower halves. The      kettle then should be placed on a large burner or the      hottest spot on your cookstove.    </p>    <p>      Bring the pot to a boil, cover, and keep it boiling for two      hours (as its vapor steams out, add more boiling water).      The jars and/or tins of steamed pudding may be carefully      lifted out and set aside to cool at the end of the two      hours. When the containers have cooled, wash their outsides      with hot, soapy water . . . cover them with fancy paper      (tied with colorful scraps of yarn)... and store the little      puddings until you're ready to give them to friends and      relatives. CARROTJAM Combine six cups of grated raw carrot,      six cups of liquid honey, three lemons (juice and rind),      and a teaspoon and a half of mixed cinnamon and nutmeg in a      large saucepan. Stir the mixture constantly as you bring it      to a boil over medium heat, and continue stirring the jam      while it "rolls" for approximately one hour. The cooked      spread is then poured into sterilized recycled jars      and-once it has cooled-the containers are capped, washed      dressed up in foil or colored paper, and tied with yarn.    </p>    <h3>      CARROT SALAD    </h3>    <p>      And when you're invited at the last minute to a potluck      holiday supper, or you just want something "special, but      quick" to take to a neighbor's house . . . try this one:    </p>    <p>      Put eight to ten carrots (depending on their size) through      the coarse blade of your food chopper or "slice 'em fine"      with an ordinary kitchen grater (and if you expect to serve      a lot of people, keep on chopping or grating until you've      filled a good sized salad bowl and scale the other      ingredients up to match). Then    </p>    <p>      stir in one-half cup of commercially prepared mayonnaise or      one-half cup of yogurt or sour cream that you've mixed      together with two tablespoons of liquid honey and one      teaspoon of white vinegar (use more or less vinegar to suit      your taste). If you like you may also add a handful of      washed raisins for an extra taste treat.    </p>    <h3>      GOOD THEN, GOOD NOW    </h3>    <p>      These recipes were used by my mother in the 20's (when we      lived on a homestead in Canada's province of Alberta), and      1 think they're just as good now as they were then. Give      them a try . . . and see what you think of these oldtime      "gifts from the kitchen".    </p>    <p>      MOTHER'S NOTE: One of my official recipe tester/tasters      tried all three of these treats before this issue went to      press and reports: [1] The pudding is, indeed, delicious.      So tasty, in fact, that you're well advised to at least      double the recipe (which only makes three pints). [2] The      jam is tasty too . . . but this oldtime formulation makes a      spread that is far chewier than today's sugar- and      pectinlaced products. You've been warned. [3] The carrot      salad rates a rave review without the raisins. And with      them? Mercy! It's scrumptious!    </p>		<hr />
