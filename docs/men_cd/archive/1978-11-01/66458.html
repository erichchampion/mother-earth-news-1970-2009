That's why it pleases us to be able to      present</em> - <em>on a regular basis</em> -      <em>the following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>		<hr />		<h3>      THE PROBLEM OF ATOMIC WASTE    </h3>    <p>      The possibility of catastrophic nuclear power-plant      "accidents" (discussed in "Ecoscience", MOTHER NOS. 51 and      52) isn't the only reason why we-and many other      scientists-are apprehensive about the spread of      nuclear power. Perhaps an even greater danger exists in the      radioactive wastes produced within the power generators      themselves. Until a means of safely disposing of these      materials is found, the production of "no risk"      nuclear-generated electricity will be impossible.    </p>    <p>      Remember that most reactors split uranium 235 (U-235)      nuclei to produce heat energy. That heat provides steam,      which in turn spins generator turbines. However, when the      uranium atoms split they create fragments (called "fission      products"), and the waste problem begins. The fragments,      for example, contaminate the reactor's fuel rods so badly      that the rods must be replaced about once a year. (This      replacement is necessary because the fission products      "poison" the chain reaction by absorbing neutrons      <em>without</em> fissioning. The trapped neutrons are then      unable to sustain the "atomic" reaction.)    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, because many of these fragments remain highly      radioactive after they're formed, the fuel rods (in which      most of the fragments become embedded) are also      radioactively "hot" by the time they're removed from the      reactors. These used rods, in fact, are so radioactive that      they're normally stored at the power plants for a period of      several months . . . until some of their most dangerous      contaminants have had a chance to decay into somewhat less      harmful materials.    </p>    <p>      The spontaneous changes in nuclei that result in the      emission of radioactivity, you see, <em>always</em>      transform an atom into something else. If its chemical      properties are altered, the atom becomes another element.      On the other hand, if an atom's nucleus is changed but its      chemical properties remain the same . . . a different      isotope of the same element is formed.    </p>    <p>      Uranium 235, for example, decays in a long series of steps      that include the radioactive isotopes radium 226, radon      222, and polonium 218. The end result, finally, is the      chemically stable, non"hot", lead 206.    </p>    <p>      The process of this breakdown is statistically predictable,      even though the instant at which a single nucleus will be      spontaneously transformed isn't. For this reason, atomic      decay is measured in "half-lives", which indicate the time      needed for one-half of the billions of atoms in a small      quantity of material to undergo this transformation.    </p>    <p>      Let's take an example: One of the major short-lived      isotopes in used nuclear fuel elements-iodine      131-has a half-life of 8.1 days. This means that,      when 8.1 days have passed from any given time, half of the      iodine 131 will be gone. After 16.2 days, only a quarter of      the original quantity of isotope will be left . . . only      one-eighth after 24.3 days . . . and so on. A period of 20      half-lives (which is less than six months in the case of      iodine 131) will reduce the original radioactive isotope to      one <em>millionth</em> of its initial mass.    </p>    <p>      You can see, then, that if <em>all</em> fission products      had half-lives of about a week, the storage of these wastes      wouldn't present much of a problem. They could simply be      held at powerplant sites for a. year or so, and could then      be disposed of in any way suitable to their      <em>chemical</em> characteristics. Residual radioactivity      would be-by that time-practically nonexistent.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, however, many of the fission products      regularly produced in nuclear reactors have extremely long      half-lives. Those of strontium 90 and cesium 137 are 28 and      30 years respectively . . . which means that these isotopes      would have to be stored for 1,000 years before their      radioactivity could be safely ignored. And plutonium 239,      which is formed in reactors by the non-fission absorption      of neutrons into uranium 238, has a half-life of 24,400      years. This material, in short, should be kept out of the      environment for at least one-half million years . . . which      is something on the order of <em>100 times longer</em> than      the human race has been recording its history!    </p>    <p>      The magnitude of our radioactive waste problem was made      clear in a 1974 study by the now-defunct Atomic Energy      Commission. The AEC calculated the amount of hot waste it      expected would accumulate in the United States by the year      2000. Then the commission figured out how much air would be      needed to dilute these materials to the so-called "maximum      permissible concentration", or MPC. (At the MPC an      individual who breathed the wastepolluted air would receive      no more than four times the average exposure caused by      natural radiation sources.)    </p>    <p>      And the AEC discovered that-by 2000 A.D.-the      amount of air required to safely dilute the United States'      inventory of atomic wastes would be 7,300,000,000,000 cubic      kilometers ... approximately 1,750,000,000,000 cubic miles.      This number represents a block of air 12,000 miles on a      side: a mass large enough to cover the entire planet to a      depth of 4,000 miles!    </p>    <p>      And one hundred years after that, 456,000,000,000 cubic      miles would still be necessary. Add one thousand years, and      the figure is still 36,000,000,000 cubic miles. And even a      million years later (1,002,000 A.D), approximately a      billion cubic miles of air would <em>still</em> be      necessary to reach the MPC.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that these incredible volumes of atmosphere      would only serve to dilute the radiation that still      remained in wastes that the AEC expected to have      accumulated by the year 2000. The figures don't even take      into consideration any wastes that might be produced      <em>after</em> that cutoff date!    </p>    <p>      The staggering size of these numbers helps to drive home      the magnitude of our nation's nuclear waste disposal      problem. Still, there are those in the      government-industry-nuclear establishment who would prefer      that the public <em>didn't</em> understand how overwhelming      this problem actually is.    </p>    <p>      General Electric, for example, states reassuringly that the      annual wastes produced by a nuclear power plant are      equivalent-in size-to about one aspirin tablet      for every person served by the installation.    </p>    <p>      This statement is a two-dimensional lie. In the first      place, University of California physicist John P. Holdren      has calculated (using AEC data) that "high level"      wastes-in their most concentrated form-actually      amount to a mass the size of about ten aspirins for every      person served.    </p>    <p>      And those high level wastes are only the <em>most</em>      radioactive residues of the fuel. There is an additional      five tablets' worth of waste per person in the form of the      intensely radioactive remains of the alloy tubes that      <em>held</em> the fuel. Furthermore, intermediate-level and      low-level wastes-which contain some very dangerous      and long-lived isotopes-amount to well over 3,000 of      those aspirin-tablet-sized portions of deadly material per      person each and every year.    </p>    <p>      And this "understatement" of the volume of radioactive      wastes (by a factor of more than 3,000) is actually the      less dangerous side of General Electric's lie. The company      committed an even more serious deception when it placed      emphasis on the <em>amount</em> of the radioactive      materials, rather than on the extremely high      <em>toxicity</em> of these wastes. As Professor Holdren put      it, "If a tablet were to be an apt comparison, it would      have to be a cyanide tablet . . . and even that would not      do justice to the actual toxicity of the fission products."      (As a matter of fact, one-year-old radioactive waste is at      least 100 <em>times more toxic,</em> by volume, than      cyanide.)    </p>    <p>      We look forward to the day when the nuclear industry will      be honest enough to announce that "The wastes produced      annually by a nuclear power plant are equivalent in size to      only several hundred cyanide tablets per person served."      But even that unlikely candor would be misleading, because      cyanide can be easily detoxified.    </p>    <p>      Radioactive isotopes, on the other hand, can't be      decontaminated either easily <em>or</em> rapidly. In many      cases the only practical thing to do with these dangerous      poisons is to wait until their own slow decay can render      them harmless .. which can take a very, very long time.    </p>    <p>      If humanity does embark on a fullscale fission power      program it will, in essence, be grabbing an almost immortal      tiger by the tail. Our next column will examine the      question of whether or not-if we <em>do</em> grab the      beast-there's any safe way to let go.    </p>    <p>      <em>Details on the nuclear waste problem, radioactivity,      and related subjects may be found in</em> Ecoscience:      Population, Resources, Environment <em>by Paul R.
