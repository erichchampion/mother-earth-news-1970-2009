                     <p>      <em>"The days of the free homestead aren't over," says Morenci,      Michigan's Del Gasche. "There really is 'free' acreage out      there all over the continent just waiting for you to claim      it as your own . . . if you know how to go about it."</em>    </p>                 <p>      My wife, Fran, and I own 36.5 acres of land plus farm      buildings. The property contains a spring-fed, year-round      creek . . . 10 acres of bottomland surrounded by 15 acres      of woods . . . and pastures, sandy hills, and fencerows.      It's a small farm filled with secret places that we share      with hawks, owls, deer, and muskrats. And, best of all, the      place didn't really cost us anything. We, in effect, got it      for free.    </p>   <h3> HOW WE DID IT</h3>    <p>      We actually started toward our present, pleasant      "landholder for free" status a few seasons back. That was      when we purchased 120 acres with $20,000 down and a land      contract for the remaining $34,000, payable at $1,000 a      year on the principal and 5% interest on the balance.    </p>    <p>      What? You say you don't have $20,000? Well, we didn't      either until we'd saved for several years. And the amount      is academic, anyway: We could have purchased our original      120 acres with a far smaller down payment than the one we      made. Nothing, in short, would have changed except the      actual dollar figures involved. The principle - the      "secret" of winding up with a farm for free - would      have remained the same.    </p>    <p>      And part of that secret was the fact that we didn't really      want 83.5 of those 120 acres in the first place. We didn't      want the 83.5 acres of "good" field-crop land that all the      local farmers wanted. No. What we were after was the 36.5      acres of "worthless" creek bottom, buildings, woods, etc.      that we knew would make an ideal MOTHER-type homestead.    </p>    <p>      This, of course, gave us a tremendous advantage in any land      deal we undertook. Everyone else looked at the whole 120      acres and tried to balance the cost of "improving" the      rough 36.5 acres against the profit he or she could make      farming those other 83.5 acres of field crops. And then the      other potential purchasers would mentally calculate how      long they'd have to farm the whole 120 acres to make enough      money to be able to buy yet another piece of property and      expand their holdings even further.    </p>    <p>      We, on the other hand, had no intention of "improving" that      rough 36.5-acre tract at all. We liked it just the way it      was. Furthermore, we figured that 36.5 acres was a plenty      big enough "place in the country" for us. We had no desire      to parlay it into "bigger and more efficient" landholdings      of any kind. As a matter of fact, we didn't even want to      farm the "good" 83.5 acres that went with it.    </p>    <p>      So we "cash-rented" those 83.5 acres to a local farmer for      enough money to cover our land contract payments and real      estate taxes for the whole 120 acres. And we did that for      four full years . . . four years during which our farm      earned all the land and tax payments that were due, without      our having to lift a finger.    </p>    <p>      We then checked out the local market and discovered that we      could sell those 83.5 acres for $800 an acre. (That's a      total of $66,800 for 36.5 fewer acres than we had paid      $54,000 for . . . just four years earlier!)    </p>    <p>      And so we sold our "good" land. But not through a real      estate salesman. We knew the property was worth $800 an      acre so we simply offered it for that amount to a      neighboring farmer . . . and he took it.    </p>    <p>      It cost us $1,000 to have the 83.5 acres surveyed and a      legal description drawn up. We paid another $100 to a local      lawyer for handling the contract. And we accepted $6,000 as      a down payment from our neighbor and allowed him one full      year in which to come up with the rest of the sale price.      (Our lawyer drew up a land contract which stated that no      interest would be charged on the principal if it were paid      within 90 days. After that, 10% interest retroactive to the      signing of the contract would be due and the entire amount      would be due one year from the contract's closing.)    </p>    <p>      Yes, we could have made more money if we'd taken out a      30-year contract with our neighbor at a higher interest      rate than the 5% we were paying on the contract we already      had. But - instead of living for 30 years with all      the loose ends of making payments and receiving payments      - we elected to "take the money and run". After all,      the purpose of the whole transaction was to provide us with      a place in the country . . . not to put us into the real      estate business.    </p>    <h3>THE BOTTOM LINE</h3>    <p>      As it turned out, our buyer took nearly a year to arrange      his financing . . . and that year cost him $6,080 in      interest. It also cost us one year's loss of rent and one      year's interest on our own debt (a total of $4,500) .    </p>    <p>      The settlement, then, looked like this: We received a      final, lump-sum payment of $66,343.35 from our buyer. From      this we had to pay $50 for title insurance, $25 for      document preparation, $4.00 for recording fees, $73.70 for      state tax stamps, $597.40 for real estate taxes . . . and      $30,500 went to pay off the balance on our original land      contract. This left us with $35,093.25 ($66,343.35 minus      $31,250.10) in our pockets.    </p>    <p>      In other words: Fran and I walked into the lawyer's office      owning 120 acres of land encumbered by a $30,500 debt . . .      and we walked out owning 36.5 acres free and clear and      carrying a check for $35,093.25! Even when you subtract the      capital gains tax we paid on the deal, we still got more      than our original Investment back . . . plus 36.5 acres      with buildings free and clear. Our farm, in short, was      free!    </p>    <h3>HOW YOU CAN DO THE SAME</h3>    <p>      If you'd like to work the same economic miracle for      yourself, just remember the facts of life in today's real      estate market: Two kinds of property - the mini-farm      of a few acres and the big farm made up almost entirely of      tillable fields - are in great demand . . . and both      types of property are overpriced,    </p>    <p>      There are, on the other hand, countless small farms and      family holdings of 60, 80, 120, and 160 or so acres      scattered throughout the United States and Canada. And a      great many of these places are "mixed bag" properties . . .      various amounts of cleared and tillable land combined with      some rough acres and a few old family farm buildings. Big      farmers, in general, look at such acreage and are put off      by the rough land and old farm buildings (which they don't      want to fool with). And back-to-the-landers generally never      even look at these properties at all (because they want      only 20 or 40 acres, instead of 80 or 100 or more).    </p>    <p>      And right there is where you come in. Save up a nest egg.      Then use it to buy a large piece (larger than you really      want) of "mixed bag" - both tillable and rough      - land. Next, cash-rent out the good fields while the      local real estate market rises. And finally, survey out and      sell the tillable (with big machinery) acreage for more      than you paid for the whole piece of property . . . leaving      you - free and clear - with a little      "picturesque" homestead, and money in your pocket.    </p>    <p>      Play this "secret" game right (the way we've done it) and      you shouldn't have any trouble duplicating our success.      Just don't get greedy. Don't make a fetish of buying at the      absolute bottom dollar and then lying awake nights scheming      to sell at the very maximum top dollar.    </p>    <p>      Buy at a fair price, wait for the market to go up, split      your property, and sell at a fair price. Let our      inflationary economy do the work for you. Relax. Be      satisfied with getting the little homestead of your dreams      for nothing . . . with, maybe, some cash money left over.      That's what we've done. And we see no reason why you can't      do it too.    </p>
