                		<hr />    <p>      Yep! After years of scrimping and saving every penny (many      of which came from MOTHER's Lifetime Subscribers), THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>© has finally purchased 622.4 acres      of beautiful mountains and valleys and streams and lakes      and clearings and shady groves and ferny dells and pastures      and woodlands and old log cabins not very far from her home      offices in Hendersonville, North Carolina.<br />      <br />      The photographs across the top of these two pages will give      you a small idea of the incredible variety of elevations      (running from 2,080 to 2,720 feet above sea level), soil,      native flora and fauna, etc., that you'll find on this      nearly-mile-square piece of property.<br />      <br />      And if you've been reading this magazine any length of time      at all, you've probably already got an inkling of the      .passively solar-heated underground :dwellings, biodynamic      gardens, self-contained hydroelectric systems, windplants,      and other environmentally oriented installations that we'll      soon be making on MOTHER's land.<br />      <br />      The idea, in short, is to tap the best and most inventive      minds of the world (many of whom you've already seen      featured in this magazine's pages) to construct a showplace      "Community of the Future": a food self-sufficient, energy      self-sufficient village that "rests lightly" on the      surrounding countryside . . . a delightful place in which      to live, filled with inhabitants who couldn't care less if      the Arabs shut off the oil, the coal miners go on strike,      or the nation's truckers refuse to haul food across state      lines.    </p>        <p>      Or, to put it another way: We (and you) already know that      $100,000 homes can be constructed for $20,000 . . . and      that once you move into such a dwelling, the house can be      heated and cooled forevermore for no more than $15 or $20 a      year. And that it's extremely fulfilling (rather than a      chore) to grow far more healthful food for your family      yourself than any supermarket will ever sell. And that it's      better (and easier) to set up your own home business than      to punch a time clock. And that communities-once again-can      be designed and built for people, instead of cars. And we      (and you) know many other related things . . . if, for no      other reason, than that we've all read about them in this      magazine.<br />      <br />      But just publishing a story about a passively solar-heated      house here . . . and a successful home business there ...      and a new wholistic gardening breakthrough somewhere else .      . . isn't good enough anymore. If we ever hope to rub this      society's nose in the fact that life can be different, and      better, and more environmentally oriented, and more      satisfying in the bargain . . . we're just going to have to      bring all of these good things together in one spot at the      same time for everyone to see firsthand.    </p>        <p>      And that's exactly what MOTHER's Community of the Future is      all about. And we're well on our way to making it a      reality. And we expect to keep right on financing this work      very largely the same way we've been financing it in the      past: with the revenues we receive from the sale of      Lifetime Subscriptions to this magazine.<br />      <br />      So if you've ever thought about signing up for a lifetime      of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>°, this is the time to do it      (just as 3,063 other good people-see page 12 of this      issue-have already done).<br />      <br />      Your investment ($300 for U.S. subscribers, $350 Canadian      and foreign), remember, does three things: [1] It makes it      just that much easier for us to keep publishing still      bigger and better MOTHERS, [2] it assures you of receiving      everyone of those issues that you're entitled to for as      long as there is a MOTHER (forever, we hope!), and [3] it      helps us finance the Environmental Research Center that      we're already starting to build on the lovely piece of land      you see above.<br />      <br />      That's really stretching today's shrinking dollar and, in      return for your non-refundable contribution, you will      receive [1] every issue of MOTHER that is printed for as      long as you live, [2] recognition-unless you request      otherwise-in this magazine, [3] a genuine Certificate of      Thanks, [4] your name-unless you request      otherwise-listed permanently at the Center as one of The      People Who Made This Research Center Possible, and [5] the      satisfaction of becoming part of, we hope, Something That      Counts.<br />      <br />      ONE FINAL NOTE: Inflation, as you know, is really starting      to get out of hand here in the United States (and in other      parts of the world) and all signs point to even worse      inflation in the years ahead. For that reason, the price of      a lifetime subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) will      be raised to $500 for U.S. subscribers and $600 for      subscribers in Canada and all foreign countries as of      January 1, 1979.<br />      <br />      This, then, is the last time you'll ever have a chance to      take advantage of the current bargain price for yourself or      for anyone that you want to give the "best possible"      Christmas present to this year. Better hurry if you want to      get in while the old rates are still good!<br />      <br />      Just fill out the handy, pre-addressed order envelope that      should be bound right in between these two pages, slip in      your check, seal, and drop the form in the mail. Or address      your own envelope to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739. Either way . . .      welcome aboard MOTHER's Grand Adventure! And thanks for      taking part!    </p>    <hr />
