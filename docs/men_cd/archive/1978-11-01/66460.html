        <p>As we recently reported (see MOTHER NO. 52, pages 94-95), a fellow named Charles Curnutt-out in Twentynine Palms, California-has developed a rather Ingenious solar furnace that almost anyone should be able to build, set up in his or her back yard, and use to-among other things-make enough solar-heated steam to run a steam engine.</p><p>And, as we also reported, some of MOTHER's researchers are now hard at work refining Mr. Curnutt's solar furnace so that eventually-we hope-we can publish plans for the finished version of the machine and we can ail get on with the construction of our backyard solarpowered steam rigs.</p><p>And that's about where everything still stands as this issue of your favorite magazine goes to press . . . but we thought maybe you'd like to see a picture of MOTHER's test version of Charles Curnutt's invention, just so's you'd know that we are on the job!</p>
