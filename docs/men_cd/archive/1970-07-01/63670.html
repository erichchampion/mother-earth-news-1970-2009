                    <p>      <strong>SPOKANE NATURAL</strong> , $5.00/YEAR<br />      P.O. Box 1276<br />      Spokane, Washington 99210    </p>    <p>      The average American adult seems to believe that laziness      rates high on the list of musts for being a (cringe)      hippie. Actually, though the majority of heads shun the      typical nine-to-five mind-shrinking drudge, most members of      the disestablishment not only find it necessary to search      out some gainful employment . . . but can really dig      working. Under the right conditions.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the number of jobs available to young people      even verging on freakiness is quite limited. Especially      around Spokane. Those jobs that <em>are</em> open are often      quite distasteful and short-lived.    </p>    <p>      Since many heads like to work hard for part of the year and      reap the benefits the rest of the time, the ideal job for      such people would be a seasonal occupation. One that pays      proportionately to the amount of labor involved. A job open      to anyone capable of handling the work - freaky or not.    </p>    <p>      We've found one occupation we'd like to recommend to those      of you looking for this sort of deal.    </p>    <p>      Last year, a couple we know decided to pick apples for the      fall and were so monetarily successful and spoke so highly      of the experience that this year, prompted by a fruit      growing co-op's ad in the Spokane papers, we decided to try      it ourselves.    </p>    <p>      We ended up driving from Wenatchee up the Okanogan Valley      nearly into Canada, looking for the Right Place to work.      After stopping several times, we landed four miles out of      Tonasket at a place next door to the farm the fruit co-op      sent us to.    </p>    <p>      Wildly enough, we really lucked out. Because we were a      couple, the fellow who hired us decided to let us live in a      small housetrailer that he and his wife use on weekends      during the winter. Though we had only cold running water      and an outhouse, we soon found that we were much better off      than the pickers who end up in clapboard cabins, possibly      woodheated, often rather grungy.    </p>    <p>      Also, it turned out, our boss was an extremely nice guy,      and we became quite friendly with him and his wife.    </p>    <p>      I guess this is what really turned us on an awful lot about      the whole apple-picking deal. You see, it was not only our      boss and his wife who were friendly, but everyone we met,      all around this apple area. Everyone was SUPERfriendly,      nice and open with us. No standoffishness because of long      hair, beards or obvious hippiness. It really freaked us      out, but it was great!    </p>    <p>      We finally figured that those people must see so many      oddies - winos, fruit tramps, greasers - coming every year      to pick, that we were nothing new. There were even a few      heads, but there could be a lot more.    </p>    <p>      Pickers are getting harder to find every year. This is due,      in part, to the dying out of the traditional wino fruit      tramp (or fruit removal engineer, as the joke claims he's      called during picking season).    </p>    <p>      The orchardists will hire anyone, experienced or not. And,      if you like the work, you can come back next year and get      preference from your boss: Better trees, higher paying      apples, etc.    </p>    <p>      Picking season starts about the middle of September on the      southern edge of this region and begins progressively later      in areas farther and farther north. The season lasts four      to six weeks, depending on weather and quantity of crop.      During that time, if you're working a good orchard (one      that's well kept, well thinned, pruned and mostly younger      trees on reasonably level land), and if you work your tail      off seven days a week (most places, you set your own      schedule, within reason), you stand a chance of making $800      to $900. Maybe more, if you really hustle.    </p>    <p>      Now that's optimum conditions.    </p>    <p>      Facts to remember are that you'll be toting a bag - that,      full, weighs about 30 lbs., strapped around your shoulders,      up and down ladders to the bins - a good part of the day.      It's not easy work.    </p>    <p>      Also, until you catch on to the gentle - but quick - touch,      or if you get bad picking (big trees, small apples), it can      be pretty discouraging when you get only two bins a day. Or      less.    </p>    <p>      Most bins used now hold 25 bags. Bins pay from $5 to $6 on      the average, depending on the type of apple. If you've got      good picking (small trees, big apples), you can average 6      bins a day. Some oldtimers get 10 or 12 (don't let the old      guys bum you - they'll just drink it up).    </p>    <p>      The best way to find apple-picking jobs is to come over      just before the season and ask around. The Farm Labor      people have orange information trailers parked in nearly      every town. They also have labor camps in many places where      you can eat and sleep for a minimal fee.    </p>    <p>      Most orchardists provide housing, though, especially if you      get there early in the harvest. Even if you don't, the      turn-over is fantastic (because the winos go on benders and      split), so there's almost never a lack of jobs. Start      looking anywhere in the Columbia Basin or the Okanagan      Valley, from Yakima to Wenatchee up to Canada.    </p>    <p>      And if you really like apple picking, or you find you have      a talent for it, you might like to explore the possibility      of other fruit-picking jobs. Arizona and California have      lemons, oranges grow in California and Florida (these are      wintertime best bets), and all sorts of other fruits and      vegetables are begging to be harvested, too.    </p>    <p>      It's hard work but the people you'll meet are fascinating,      the whole area is fantastically beautiful, you'll be      working outdoors among orchards of peaceful, happy trees .      . . and the money you earn could keep you warm through a      long, cold winter.    </p>
