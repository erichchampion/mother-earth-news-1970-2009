                    <h5 id="byline">      by MARTIN JEZER from EVO    </h5>    <p>      Despite highest crop yields per acre in history, American      agriculture is in a state of acute crisis. Farmers have      been treating the soil the way speed freaks treat their      bodies - with similar results.    </p>    <p>      The Meth that is used down on the farm is artificial      fertilizer, an "upper" that stimulates rapid plant growth      without contributing anything to soil health. In the short      run, as with speed freaks, crops grow at a frantic pace.      But in the long run, the use of these artificial and      inorganic chemical fertilizers destroys the soil and      saturates the ground with chemicals that do not break down      or decompose into the earth.    </p>    <p>      Nitrogen in the soil is vital to plant growth, but when      huge doses of this element are shot into the earth as an      ingredient in artificial fertilizer, the results are often      disastrous. The crops absorb some of the nitrogen, but much      of it seeps through the soil into the ground water to      pollute rivers, lakes and drinking water.    </p>    <p>      According to Dr. Barry Commoner, director of the Center for      the Study of Biology Systems at Washington University in      St. Louis, excess nitrogen in drinking water can cause a      serious infant disease, methemoglobinemia. A number of      public wells in California have been closed by health      officials due to high nitrate content in the water. Says      Dr. Commoner: "The agricultural wealth of California's      Central Valley has been gained at a cost that does not      appear on the farmer's balance sheets - the general      pollution of the state's huge underground water reserves      with nitrate."    </p>    <p>      Nitrate run-off in the ground water also encourages the      growth of algae, which removes oxygen from water. These      "algae-blooms" turn lakes and rivers into cesspools which,      lacking oxygen, are unable to sustain aquatic life. This is      happening in such cornbelt states as Illinois where,      according to Dr. Commoner, "Every major river is      overburdened with fertilizer drainage."    </p>    <p>      Dependence on artificial, inorganic fertilizers has also      diminished the mineral content of the soil. Consequently,      the food we eat is lacking in nutritional value - at least      in comparison with the farm produce of yesteryear when good      crops were dependent on healthy soil and farmers put back      into the soil what the year's crop took out. (Refining and      processing food also robs it of nutritional value; by the      time we get to eat it, losses may be as high as 50%.)    </p>    <p>      Agricultural research is directed at bigger and prettier      crops for supermarket display. Soil health is virtually      ignored. Our agriculture is based on the faith that, no      matter how depleted our soil, it can continue to produce      bountiful crops year after year if shot up with massive      doses of chemical fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      American farmers are encouraged by the U.S. Department of      Agriculture (USDA) and by trade publications like <em>Farm      Journal</em> to accept the necessity of chemical farming      for high yields, even at the acknowledged expense of      healthy, balanced, nutrient-rich soil. Dr. Commoner has      said: "We cannot speed up the biological cycle, as USDA      policy has tried to do, without getting into serious      trouble."    </p>    <p>      Dr. Commoner has also noted that nothing will change this      absurd farming system except ". . . a fundamental revision      of the entire economy of agricultural production in this      country." What does that mean?    </p>    <p>      1 - Agriculture must be viewed in social terms and not as a      business. We must support marginal and subsistence farms      and encourage people (with financial grants) to move back      to the land and return fallow fields to cultivation. This      would ease pressures on the cities, lead to a more evenly      balanced population and create the possibility for further      change.    </p>    <p>      2 - We must decentralize our entire agriculture system, so      that local areas can raise their own produce.    </p>    <p>      With thousands of small farms in operation this would be      feasible. It isn't now.    </p>    <p>      3 - USDA research should be redirected towards organic      farming methods. This would include developing new farm      machinery (mulchers, shredders, etc.), recycling garbage      (turning organic wastes, autumn leaves, etc. into compost)      and making these machines available to all farmers.    </p>    <p>      This will be no easy task. Both government and business are      committed to large-unit, mechanized, chemical farming. The      better farmers are as concerned with the environment as we      are but they are exposed only to USDA information and trade      journals which serve the interests of corporate      agriculture. What can we do?    </p>    <p>      Probably, farmers can be most easily reached by      professional scientists like Dr. Commoner but rural      communes can provide worthwhile examples too.    </p>    <p>      The communes can do this by getting involved in organic      farming and marketing their produce in ways that educate      the public and create a demand for organically grown food.      (For instance, distribute literature with the produce;      "compete" by comparing the poison-free vegetables with the      crap that passes for food in supermarkets: supply urban      communes and food-buying cooperatives with low-priced,      healthy foods.)    </p>    <p>      Ecology-action groups on campuses can help by demanding      organic food in eating halls, cafeterias, student unions,      etc.    </p>    <p>      And, finally, groups can start "People's Gardens" in parks,      abandoned lots, in the suburbs, on campuses, etc. They can      grow food for the community and hold free feasts at harvest      time.    </p>    <p>      People with other suggestions and ideas should put them      into practice and get the word around. The Movement has      ignored the farmer and U.S. agriculture policy for too      long. How many harvests have we left?    </p>
