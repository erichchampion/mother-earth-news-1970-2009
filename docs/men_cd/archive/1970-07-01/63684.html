                    <h5 id="byline">      by G. SCOTT    </h5>        <p>      <strong>WIN</strong> , $5.00/YEAR, 339 Lafayette St., N.Y.,      N.Y. 10012<br />    </p>    <p>      Although the back-to-the-land movement means getting away      from people and moving in with trees and grass, many      potential nature lovers are terrorized by thoughts of the      loneliness and isolation which may be experienced. It's a      real love-hate relationship. We love nature, but we feel      secure in the crowds of the big cities.    </p>    <p>      Communes are an answer. But if members of a commune are      afraid to be alone, I feel this may break up the very      commune they want to form.    </p>    <p>      May I suggest, as one solution to facing yourself alone,      the job of forest fire lookout. True, you will be trapped      on a mountain with primitive facilities, but you will also      know that your time there is limited, and that you are in      constant radio communication with other lookouts. You will      also be living in the woods during the most pleasant part      of the year and you will make a substantial sum of money      because you can't spend any while you're there!    </p>    <p>      Here's how you make it happen: Write the U.S. Forest      Service, Washington, D.C. and request a list of all forests      which need lookouts. The west coast has the largest need      and the office for all west coast forests is in Portland,      Oregon. I don't know the exact address but a letter should      get to the proper place if you write U.S. Forest Service,      Portland, Oregon.    </p>    <p>      After you get your list of forests, write to each one and      request the name of each ranger station and the fire      control officer in charge.    </p>    <p>      Now, fill out the miserable Civil Service Form No. 57 which      you can get at your local post office (it's 4 pages!?) and      write a personal letter (NOT a carbon copy) to the officer      at every station that interests you.    </p>    <p>      Tell, in the letter, whether or not you have a car (it is      not essential, but helps). If you want to bring a mate, say      so (they love couples but you'll have to lightly refer to      your partner as a wife or husband even if she or he isn't).    </p>    <p>      Anything personal you can do will help. My mate and I even      telephoned a ranger. Tell them you've fought a fire      somewhere. I don't know if this is general, but they even      asked to see my man's discharge papers from the army.    </p>    <p>      Then you sit back and wait. If you do all the red tape,      you're bound to get several offers! Just don't wait until      too late in the season: The deadline for applications is      about the end of March or middle of April.    </p>    <p>      One word of warning: There are hangups. The Forest Service      is organized along para-military discipline. Probably they      are in favor of the Vietnam War. If you're into trying to      change people's heads, though, you'll have a lot of time      for rapping and persuading your fellow lookouts. And, if      your superiors are distasteful, you'll - at least - be 40      miles away from them!    </p>    <p>      There are other pluses: As lookouts, we met some mighty      nice individuals, tending a forest is an honorable job      (although some folks have ulterior motives) and living and      working in natural surroundings can bring a person's best      qualities to the surface.    </p>
