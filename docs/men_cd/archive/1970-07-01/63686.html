                    <h5 id="byline">      by KR. SMITH, M.D.    </h5>    <p>      <strong>Willamette Bridge</strong><br />      522 W. Burnside<br />      Portland Oregon 97209<br />    </p>    <p>      The first few pleasant days of spring always bring      thousands of pale, moldy humans bursting from their caves      to renew an acquaintance with Ma Nature. For most people,      this is a relatively nontraumatic experience. But for some      - especially the hard-core urbanites and those with short      memories - the adventure may be akin to crossing a freeway      blindfolded. You have only to spend an idle hour or two in      any hospital emergency room on Sunday afternoon from      mid-May through August to get an idea of the scope of the      problem.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, we offer some general guides of what to do (or,      often, what not to do) when Nature retaliates. Most of this      is well covered in any standard first-aid manual, but we      will try to condense some of the important information into      a few paragraphs. The following is, necessarily, highly      selective . . . so if your favorite injury or poisoning is      not covered, you are invited to look it up yourself.    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>FLYING AND CRAWLING THINGS</strong>    </p>        <p>      Bees (including wasps, hornets, yellowjackets, etc.) scare      many people half to death but only rarely are their stings      really dangerous. For the vast majority, bee stings are      painful and sometimes swell quite badly but - once the      sting has occurred - there is little or nothing to do.      Nothing that you rub or spray on the skin, swallow or say      to the bee is going to make much difference.    </p>    <p>      If a honey bee stings and leaves the stinger sticking in      you (which is usually what happens), try to remove it      promptly <strong>without</strong> squeezing the little      poison sacs attached to the stinger. That will inject more      of the venom and make the sting worse.    </p>    <p>      Occasionally people faint, and - very unusually - may go      into <strong>anaphylactic shock</strong> (severe shock,      convulsions and even death) after a sting. This shock      should be treated like any other shock or severe injury:      Protect the individual from further injury, keep him warm,      provide shade if he is in direct sunlight, help him breathe      if necessary and GET HELP.    </p>        <p>      People who react to stings with very severe swelling or      other severe symptoms should take a potent antihistimine      immediately upon being stung. For this reason, the      antihistimine should, obviously, be carried at all times.    </p>    <p>      Ticks are found almost everywhere, but - with rare      exceptions - they carry disease only in the drier areas      like eastern Oregon and Washington, Montana, etc. When      people or animals walk through brush, the ticks drop off      leaves and burrow into the skin of the victim until only      their rear ends stick out. If you try to pull them out they      break, leaving part of the tick buried.    </p>    <p>      The best way to remove ticks is to wave a match or lighted      cigarette very close to them. Occasionally, they back out.      If not, they can be killed by covering them with mineral      oil, alcohol, etc. Once this is done, they can be easily      removed . . . sometimes. Often, however, they are stuck so      tightly that a chunk of skin has to be removed with them in      it. Obviously this should be done, preferably with local      anesthesia, by someone who knows what he is doing.    </p>    <p>      There are rattlesnakes in some areas of the country and,      every once in a while, they kill someone. When traveling in      those areas, keep your eyes <strong>and</strong> ears open,      watch where you walk, don't reach blindly into holes or      under rocks and don't panic. A rattle snake will rattle if      it gets the chance and, given an opportunity, will leave.      It's non-aggressive by nature. Only if it's trapped or      stepped on or otherwise threatened will a rattlesnake      strike. And when it does strike, it's only a few feet at      most: Usually not much over half its length.    </p>    <p>      One additional suggestion: Look before you reach into      boxes, knapsacks, etc. that have been standing on the      ground and don't climb into sleeping bags that have been      left unrolled without looking in or shaking them first.    </p>    <p>      Treatment of a rattlesnake bite must be started promptly.      First, put a tourniquet between the bite and the heart and      tighten the tourniquet to block the veins, but not the      artery. Then make small 1/4 inch-deep cuts through the bite      marks and suck out as much blood, serum and poison as      possible for 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, with the tourniquet      still in place and being careful to move the bitten part as      little as possible, get the victim to medical help.    </p>        <p>      Actually, all of these first-aid measures are of doubtful      value. The real treatment is anti-venom and there should be      as little delay as possible in getting it.    </p>    <p>      There are small leeches in some wilderness streams and      ponds. If they get on your skin, gently pick them off.    </p>    <p>      Scorpions, black widow spiders and brown recluse spiders      occur in the southwest, including Southern California.      Anyone who goes there by choice deserves what he gets.    </p>    <p>      Most flies, gnats, fleas, mosquitoes and ants are mainly      nuisances. Deer flies, black flies, horse flies and a few      others may cause painful bites, but they are not dangerous.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CUTS, SCRAPES AND BURNS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The cardinal rule is: DON'T OVERTREAT. It is possible to      turn a minor injury into a major problem in a few minutes      with the contents of the average medicine chest and a few      well-meaning friends.    </p>    <p>      For bleeding, put something clean over the wound and press      firmly. Don't use tourniquets. If a finger is bleeding, put      the hand high overhead and the bleeding will decrease or      stop.    </p>    <p>      Wash dirt from wounds with soap and water if soap is      available. If soap is <strong>not</strong> available, use      plain water. Then either leave the wound open (preferably)      or cover it with something clean if it is likely to get      dirty or bleed and make a mess. Antiseptics are seldom of      any value. Alcoholic solutions may further damage      newly-injured tissues and it may take thirty painful      minutes to remove a congealed mixture of blood and the      antiseptic powder that has been dumped on an abrasion or      burn.    </p>    <p>      If wounds are large; if bleeding is persistent and heavy;      if wounds need suturing; or if tendons, bones, joints or      internal organs may have been injured, GET HELP. This will      probably necessitate going to a hospital emergency room.    </p>    <p>      Suturing of wounds is often desirable to decrease bleeding,      speed healing and reduce the size of a scar but it is not      necessary for survival. Our ancestors got by for thousands      of generations either leaving cuts alone or improvising      ways of pulling the edges together. If a wound is wide open      and it will be impossible to have it sutured within 24      hours, clean it thoroughly and place strips of tape      perpendicular to the cut to pull the edges together. In an      emergency this is an adequate substitute for stitches.    </p>    <p>      In the case of all wounds, particularly dirty or      contaminated ones, proper tetanus innoculation is necessary      and should be done with a minimum of delay.    </p>    <p>      Small burns can usually be ignored. Once the burn has      occurred, the damage is done and, from then on, healing      takes place. Ice, cold water, vaseline or one of the burn      ointments will reduce pain.    </p>    <p>      Larger burns - especially if there is blistering or      charring of the skin - probably need special treatment, so      GET HELP.    </p>    <p>      Sunburn is surprisingly easy to acquire and its seriousness      tends to be underrated. After a long, dark winter it      doesn't take long to get a bad first degree burn -      especially on water, snow or sand where there is the      additional factor of reflection. A few hours of exposure      can lead to blistering of the skin, vomiting, shock and      high fever.    </p>    <p>      Mild to moderate sunburn is treated with nothing or with      one of the commercially available sunburn lotions. More      severe burns - especially with such systemic symptoms as      fever, vomiting or signs of shock - require special care      and, probably, hospitalization. GET HELP.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOMETHING IN THE EYE</strong>    </p>    <p>      If it flew in, blew in or fell in, the foreign object      probably is not embedded and can be removed by someone else      with a little patience. Don't be afraid to try. Use the      rolled corner of a piece of clean, soft cloth or tissue to      lift it out.    </p>    <p>      If the foreign object entered the eye with some force, it      might be embedded. If it cannot be lifted out easily, leave      it alone and GET HELP.    </p>    <p>      More severe eye injuries - especially if there is bleeding      or fluid leaking from the eye - obviously need immediate      help. In no case should the eye be rubbed or pressed. The      best protection for an injured eye is to keep the lid      closed <strong>gently</strong> until help can be found.    </p>    <p>      Irritating liquids, acids, alkalis (lye), gasoline,      solvents, etc. should be washed out thoroughly and      immediately with large amounts of water. The eye should      then be examined.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WILDLIFE</strong>    </p>    <p>      No healthy wild animal will sit or lie still and allow a      human to approach, touch or pick it up. If the animal is      injured, it may suddenly bite or scratch when touched. An      animal that seems sick, weak or crippled may have rabies.      If disturbed, it will likely bite and transmit its disease.    </p>    <p>      Treatment of rabies is a prolonged, uncomfortable and      expensive process with less than perfect results. Untreated      rabies is always fatal. So leave all the cute little mice,      squirrels, 'possums, bats, etc. strictly alone.    </p>    <p>      If you do get bitten, try to capture and keep the animal      alive. Consult a physician or the nearest health department      as soon as possible. This includes bites by stray dogs and      cats, too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PREVENTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Try to learn in advance about the area you plan to visit.      You may need boots or heavy shoes for walking in rocks;      long sleeves and trousers if you will be in brush or the      sun for along time; and warm clothing at night in some      places . . . even in the summer.    </p>    <p>      You may need to carry water, since it is better to assume      that all ground water (streams and ponds) in habitated      areas are polluted and contaminated.    </p>    <p>      If you will be where you may be cut, burned or otherwise      hurt, make up your own first-aid kit stocked with      <strong>clean</strong> pieces of cloth for simple      dressings, some gauze and tape and ajar or tube of vaseline      or burn ointment.    </p>    <p>      If you are going into some areas of the west, it may be      advisable to be vaccinated against Rocky Mountain Spotted      Fever. Find out from the Health Department before you go.    </p>    <p>      Keep tetanus immunization up to date: A booster every five      years to age 12, then every ten years.    </p>    <p>      If you react violently to bee stings either stay home or      carry an antihistimine and take it - and your chances - if      stung.    </p>    <p>      There is no preventative for poison oak or nettles: Just      learn to recognize and avoid them.    </p>
