If you haven't got two years      to play around with, we recommend that you truck on down to      your nearest book store and shell out $8.95 for your very      own copy of <em>GROW</em> <em>IT</em> ! That way, Richard      Langer will be happy, Saturday Review Press will be happy .      . . and we're betting that you'll be happy too. It's a darn      good book.    </p>    <p>      EXTRA SPECIAL NOTE: All material here reprinted from      <em>GROW IT!</em> Copyright © 1972 by Richard W.      Langer.    </p>    <p>      At last! For the first time since the HAVE-MORE Plan was      published way back in the 1940's, a fellow named Richard W.      Langer has come up with a 365-page book that really      introduces a beginner to small-scale farming. Wanna raise      your own fruit, nuts, berries, vegetables, grain, chickens,      pigs, ducks, geese and honeybees? <em>GROW IT</em> ! tells      you how to get started, we like it, and here's another      chapter from the book.    </p>    <p>      <em>If ever I dies an' yo ain't certain I's      dead,<br /></em> <em>Just butter some biscuit an' new made      bread<br /></em> <em>An' spread em all over with raspberry      jam,<br /></em> <em>Then step mighty softly to whar 1      am<br /></em> <em>An' wave dem vittles above my      head,<br /></em> <em>If my mouf don't open, I'm certainly      dead.<br /></em> -Monroe Sprowl    </p>    <p>      One of the tastiest spots on your farm is the berry patch.      Of course, it won't have just berries in it. Strawberries,      raspberries, and blackberries, their names notwithstanding,      aren't berries at all in the botanical sense. Grapes and      currants, on the other hand, are just to balance things      out, some with "berries" as part of their names really are      berries-blueberries, cranberries, and gooseberries,      for instance. Which somehow explains why they're all      grouped together here, and certainly in no way detracts      from their flavor.    </p>    <h3>BLUEBERRIES</h3>    <p>      To add further to the confusion of nomenclature, if you've      ever had huckleberry pie, or picked wild huckleberries in      the woods on a camping trip, chances are you didn't.      Blueberries have small, soft, almost invisible seeds.      Huckleberries have approximately ten big, stone-hard seeds.      Eating real huckleberry pie is rather like chewing on a      clam full of sand.    </p>    <p>      Blueberries are fussy about their growing conditions,      requiring not only loose, acid soil, but a shallow water      table and, at the same time, room for their sensitive roots      to stay dry. They're very winterhardy, however, making an      excellent crop for the Alaskan homesteader. Not only do      they like a cold winter-even the blossoms will      withstand a 10° F. frost-but the cold is      essential for most of the varieties to bear fruit. Thus as      a rule they cannot be cultivated in regions where the      temperature never goes down to freezing. However, minor      species such as the Florida Evergreen, Rabbiteye, and      Dryland will grow without the cold, and sometimes in the      more arid regions. They're worth an experiment if your land      is down South.    </p>   <h3> PROPAGATION</h3>    <p>      Wild blueberries were probably spread from area to area by      seeds in the droppings of birds and foxes. But don't sit      around waiting for your local red-winged blackbird's help.      A full-sized natural blueberry patch from seed is estimated      variously to take between fifty and a hundred and fifty      years. For best results on your farm, buy established      blueberry plants grown from cuttings. Later you can      multiply these by layering. But for the first few years      your already started bushes will II give you better      berries, and sooner.    </p>    <h3>LOCATION</h3>    <p>      Full sun is what blueberries like best, as long as ground      moisture is sufficient. If you have a swamp, blueberry      bushes may be put to good land use there, but only on      hummocks at least eight inches above the high-water mark.      They love water, but their fine roots drown easily. The      large quantities of acidic humus often found in swamps make      excellent ground for blueberries because they provide the      loose, open soil needed and often approximate the ideal pH      of 4.5. If you have friable, well-drained soil in the      garden, the plants can be successfully grown there as long      as you work in lots of acid soil-builders such as pine and      fir sawdust, oak leaves, or acidic peat moss several times      during the year preceding planting. The pH must pH also be      kept at 4.5 after planting.    </p>    <h3>PLANTING</h3>    <p>      Since you don't want to wait a decade for those      blueberries, order three-year-old stock if you can. That's      about the maximum age blueberries can be transplanted      without a major shock, due to the extensive root system      they develop. They give their first decent crop at around      seven years. By buying three-year-olds, you'll have at      least a small harvest after two years, and a full one of      between ten and fifteen quarts not too long after that.      Threeyear-old stock will be sixteen- to twenty-four-inch      bushes. Buying two separate species is suggested. Most      blueberries are selfsterile, so cross-pollination is      necessary for your crop.    </p>    <p>      You'll probably want to start the blueberry patch in early      spring. Fall planting can be done in warmer climates, but      in that case make sure you provide a very heavy winter      mulch. Space the young stock with eight feet between them      in rows eight feet apart. Dig up a three-foot circle for      each plant and return to the hole a mixture of half soil      and half acidic compost. Trim back the branches so they      spread out no more than the roots do. Check that the roots      have plenty of depth when planted.    </p>    <h3>MULCHING</h3>    <p>      Mulch when planting the first year with four inches of pine      or fir sawdust that has been composted. If the ground is      naturally acid, straw will do. The mulch should be renewed      each year in spring, always extending the circle about one      foot farther out than the widest branches.    </p>    <h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      Blueberries are quite prolific, and the new improved      varieties are prone to overbearing. Too much fruit,      particularly in the early years, can sap vital growing      strength from the plant itself. For this reason some of the      blossoms are usually trimmed off. If you have the patience      to wait an extra year for berries, it's a good idea to trim      all the blossoms off the fourth year, or, in other words,      the first year for a three-year-old transplant. In      subsequent years you'll probably want to trim off about a      fourth of the blossoms. Just dip each blossom cluster, not      the whole branch. One set of flowers left for every three      or four inches is good spacing. They will become clusters      of fruit, and you won't want to crowd them.    </p>    <p>      Suckers (straight shoots from the base of the plant) will      develop, possibly even the first year after transplanting.      For the first couple of years they should be pruned back to      the base. Unless, of course, part of the main plant died in      transplant, in which case trim away the dead wood and leave      one vigorous sucker. When the plant is six years old, let      up to four new suckers develop as part of the bush, but      trim away some of the older branches that are bearing      poorly. You don't want plant growth to stunt berry      production at this stage. A good way to remember which      branches are the unfruitful ones is to bend some colored      plastic-covered wire around them while harvesting.    </p>    <h3>HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      The reason store-bought blueberries often have little more      flavor than cotton is that they are picked as soon as they      blue out, when they are still hard and easy to ship. Wait      another week after blueing out to pick yours. This means      you'll have to harvest them by hand, since a blueberry rake      will gather the unripe with the ripe and may also bruise      the soft, fully ripened ones. Take a berry on the bush      between two fingers and twist lightly-if it falls      off, it's ripe; if you have to tug for it, it's not ripe      yet, no matter how blue it is.<br />    </p>    <h3>BRAMBLE FRUIT</h3>    <p>      In the brier-patch category you'll find red raspberries,      black raspberries, purple raspberries, yellow raspberries,      and blackberries, including the dewberry, young,      boysenberry, and loganberry. Take your pick. Personally, I      would also include the wild rose, since the rose hips found      on this bramble bush make excellent and highly nutritious      eating-just remember to remove the hairy seeds,      either with your fingers if you're eating fresh-picked      ones, or by straining if you're making jelly or fruit soup.    </p>    <h3>THE WILD BRIER PATCH</h3>    <p>      In many areas of the country you'll find a bramble patch of      native American blackberries or raspberries already growing      on the farm. The problem then is to get a bit of      organization into the thing. By hacking away large parts of      the thicket you will be increasing the yield. What you want      to do is clear paths through the patch so you can not only      get at the berries, but prune and fertilize the bushes as      well. You could, of course, try to organize the brambles      into rows like a regular berry planting. For the average      brier patch, however, it's better simply to make a cross      through the middle with two paths five or six feet wide.      This right away eliminates most of the center dead      wood.<br />    </p>    <p>      Remember to wear gloves and clothing that can stand up to      the thorns when you tackle the job. Map out your projected      cutting lanes with string or you'll have nothing but      problems. Cut the plants on the path right down to the      ground. Then dig up the roadbed and turn the soil. Those      bramble-roots are going to be stubbornly anchored, so      you'll have quite a job on your hands, but it will save a      lot of digging later. Brambles are hardy as hell if you're      trying to get rid of them. Cut to the ground and you'll      have sprouts again next year. If in spite of your rooting      job sprouts do come up in the paths later, be sure to dig      them out promptly.    </p>    <p>      After you've cleared a central crossroads through the      patch, you'll probably want to trim some of its outer edges      as well to keep the rest of the canes in harvesting reach.      The remaining canes, what's left of your patch, should then      be cut back to four feet, with all dead canes being removed      entirely, for more and better berries.    </p>    <p>      Now, having gotten the wild patch hopefully tamed and under      control, give it a good dose of compost. A nitrogen-rich      organic fertilizer will give it an extra boost with that      first post-pruning crop. Mulching the plants fully will      help retain moisture in the ground, previously shaded from      the evaporative forces of direct sunlight.    </p>    <h3>PROPAGATION</h3>    <p>      If you don't have a wild brier patch around to convert into      an instant berry garden, you'll probably have to get your      initial stock from the nursery. You may want to do this      anyway, since the varieties available today bear much      larger fruit, including such novelties as the big, tasty      amber and yellow raspberries. Buying from a nursery also      permits you to get several varieties of one species,      assuring a better crop through cross-pollination.    </p>    <p>      Buy the best two-year-old certified disease-free stock      available and, unless you have plenty of space, stick with      either red raspberries by themselves or with any      combination of the other brambles. Red raspberries      shouldn't be grown near any of the others, especially the      black varieties, which are disease-prone and catch      everything the red ones may be able to shake off lightly.    </p>    <p>      About 75 percent of your plants will take, and twenty-five      bramble bushes will yield between fifty and a hundred      quarts at maturity, which should give you an idea of how      many you will need. If you're having plants shipped by mail      rather than purchasing them from a local nursery, their      point of origin should be in your approximate latitude or      have roughly equivalent temperature conditions. Were you to      get your plants from a region much farther south than your      homestead, their stage of growth would be too advanced and      they would have a tendency, particularly the blackberries,      to produce a lot of spindly canes rather than a more      limited number of strong ones.    </p>    <p>      There are two types of bramble berry plants to choose from,      the bush and the trailing varieties. Bush berries are      hardier and easier to care for. Trailing varieties are more      cold-sensitive on the one hand, more drought-resistant on      the other. They can be trained on supporting trellises to      make for easier picking-both for you and the birds.    </p>    <p>      The propagation of cane fruits is quite simple once you      have a few roots and canes around. You can start a new      plant with a root cutting from an old one. In the fall      simply take a four-inch section of root about half an inch      in diameter and bury it under two inches of sandy loam in a      tray. Keep the tray in a cold frame if the winter      temperatures do not go much below 30° F., in a cool,      light spot indoors if they do. By spring the root piece      will have sprouted. Presto, a new plant.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to mulch it heavily its first winter outdoors. This      is a fine way to extend your berry patch in a hurry.    </p>    <p>      Layering is another way. Let a few canes grow without      pruning one year. By the end of the summer they'll be      dipping down to the ground in a rattail fashion, with only      minor leaf development along the tip. Anchor the tail with      a split peg. Bramble plants take to layering so easily you      don't even have to make the bark slit as with hazelnuts.      Cover the part touching the ground with two inches of soil,      making sure the leafy tip remains exposed. Come spring, cut      the cane about ten inches from the anchor to sever from the      parent plant. A new plant is all set to grow.    </p>    <h3>LOCATION</h3>    <p>      The best soil for bramble fruits is deep, sandy loam rich      in organic matter. The plants will grow in sandy soil low      in organic content, but the fruit will be small and seedy.      Since the berries develop during what is usually the driest      part of the year, the ability of the soil to retain      moisture is a key to their quality. But any sandy soil can      be built up with compost and mulching to induce a good      harvest. Proper drainage is, as usual, central to success.      Even claylike soils, with good drainage, on a slope, say,      can foster excellent fruit if sufficient organic matter is      incorporated for survival of the plant's hair roots. The      bramble root system usually penetrates to the two- to      three-foot level, so incorporate organic matter as deeply      as possible before planting. A pH of 6 is preferred.    </p>    <p>      The raspberry in particular suffers from weak crowns. That      is, the canes are attached to the crown (the point at which      they emerge from the ground) in such a manner that they      break off readily, especially when subjected to strong      winds. For this reason raspberries should not be planted on      an open, unprotected field, but rather at the edges where      sunlight is profuse while wind effects are moderated.    </p>    <p>      Gently sloping ground is best. Choose a hillside that faces      south, if possible, to give the bramble berries continuous      summer sun all day long. If you're planning on several      rows, contouring is essential to soil preservation. It      might seem a good idea to plant alternate rows of red and      black berries so you can conveniently pick both, but don't      forget this would probably wipe out the black ones before      they could even bear. Keep them apart-at least five      hundred feet to be safe. Also, don't set out new plants in      the vicinity of wild ones, again for reasons of disease      prevention, nor, for the same reason, where potatoes,      tomatoes, eggplant, or melons have grown in the past three      years.    </p>    <h3>PLANTING</h3>    <p>      Bramble fruits are planted as early in spring as possible      to give new growth time to strengthen sufficiently for      wintering. The only exception is in the South, where the      soil is warm enough for the roots to establish themselves      in wintertime. The plants should be set out as soon as they      arrive. Once leaves appear, the chances of success become      much slimmer and the probability of disease increases      immensely.    </p>    <p>      If your bramble plants are shipped to you rather than being      toted home from a local nursery, the first thing to do upon      their arrival is to make certain the roots are moist. Most      shipments will arrive with the root systems packed in      sphagnum moss and enclosed in plastic. Moisten if necessary      and keep the plants in the shade until you get them into      the soil.    </p>    <p>      Bramble rows should be spaced eight feet apart, with the      plants three or four feet apart in the rows. Dig a hole for      each plant one and a half feet wide by twice the depth of      the root system. Fill the bottom half of the hole with      well-aged compost. Each stem should be set with the soil      level no higher than it was at the nursery. Spread the      roots well before covering.    </p>    <p>      Settle the plants in with a heavy dousing of water. This      will make them sink down so that they are below the general      soil level. That's fine. The important thing is that the      level around the plant itself be no higher or lower than it      was before transplanting. If your soil drains poorly, it      will pay you to ridge it so the whole row of plants stands      slightly higher than the surrounding ground. Last but not      least, trim all the canes back to eight inches.    </p>    <h3>MULCHING</h3>    <p>      The best way to maintain the moisture and humus content in      your bramble patch is with a one-foot layer of straw mulch,      which should be replenished yearly. Even so, if you are in      a dry area, give the plants a good dousing of water just as      the berries begin to form, for an extra boost. It's a good      idea to mulch with six inches of used livestock bedding      first and six inches of plain straw on top. Whatever you      mulch with, don't bring it closer to the canes than six      inches-to keep field mice in their place.    </p>    <p>      Nitrogen is also important to the bushes in fruiting. The      addition of tankage or dried blood to the soil before      mulching will supply large quantites of nitrogen. Two good      handfuls spread around the base of each bearing bush once a      year is about right.    </p>    <h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      The first thing to remember about raspberries and      blackberries is that their canes are biennial. That is to      say, the first year's growth does just that, it grows,      producing no fruit. The second year these canes fruit.      Meanwhile new canes are growing for the following year's      crop. The old canes must be pruned off after harvesting,      since they will not bear again. Without pruning, the yield      of large berries will be decreased.    </p>    <p>      Pruning for the raspberries and the blackberries is about      the same. For both, "heading back" is done very early in      spring before any new growth begins. The number of young      canes, those that grew the previous year to bear the      current year, should be reduced to eight, or at most ten,      the larger number for red raspberries. Cut off weak canes,      and try for somewhat even distribution. Lopsided bushes      make fewer berries. The remaining canes should be trimmed      back to between four and six feet, according to how your      particular bush bears. If it tends to carry its fruit close      to the tips, the pruning must be moderate; if it carries      fruit midway on the canes, the pruning is more severe, and      so on. The purpose of this pruning is to reduce the number      of berries borne, in turn increasing the size of the ones      produced. You'll also want to prune the laterals sprouting      from the main canes back to eight inches.    </p>    <p>      A post-harvest pruning removes all the branches that have      borne fruit and, having borne once, will bear no more. The      canes, being biennial, usually will die back anyhow. Your      job is to cut them beforehand, so the plant doesn't expend      useless energy on them. This also helps prevent the      spreading of any disease. Trim the canes off at ground      level; leaving a few inches of stubble invites rot and      other problems.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the regular spring and post-harvest pruning,      black raspberries must be kept in check through early      summer. The reds you can leave alone. As a black raspberry      bush develops new canes for the following year's fruit,      these canes should have their tip buds cut whenever they      reach the two- to two- and-a-half-foot length, to keep them      short. This cutting, again, is to coax bigger berries from      the plant. It will also make your picking easier the next      year.    </p>    <p>      Another harvesting aid is tying each plant to a pole or, if      you have a whole row of them, stretching parallel wires      from poles at both ends of the row so the plants are      enclosed between them. This will give you a neat hedge that      doesn't constantly ensnare you in briery tentacles.    </p>    <p>      Trailing vines, of course, may be trained up trellises as      they grow. The question on the small farm is whether this      is worth all the extra time and effort. Pruning you have to      do, but staking and training you may well want to let go      till future years when you aren't quite so busy getting the      place started.    </p>    <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      Well-mulched, pruned raspberries and blackberries should      give you no trouble if grown from healthy rootstock. Just      remember to keep the raspberry reds and the rest away from      each other. In part this is a preventative measure against      anthracnose, a fungus disease characterized by rough gray      and black blotches on the canes. Trim off affected canes as      soon as you see those telltale blotches. As with all      diseased prunings, they should be burned in a hot fire. The      same holds true for spur blight, manifested by      reddish-orange to purplish-gray spots at bud junctions, or      spurs. More drastic measures must be taken with raspberry      mosaic, in which the leaves curl and turn a mottled      yellow-red. Dig out the affected plant and destroy it.      Raspberry mosaic usually strikes when the rest of your      bushes are a healthy green, so you shouldn't have much      trouble diagnosing it. In fall, of course, all plant leaves      are bound to curl and turn color. Don't dig these plants      out in a fever of doctoritis!    </p>    <h3>HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      Blackberries ripen black, but they're not ripe just because      they've turned black. A ripe berry will fall into your hand      after the lightest tug with two fingers, one on each side      of the stem. Usually this is three to four days after      they've turned black.    </p>    <p>      Raspberries are soft when they're ripe. You'll even learn      to sniff out when a bush is ready for the berry pail.      Harvest daily; they ripen quickly. If it rains during      berry-picking season, make sure to get all the ripe ones      right afterwards, or they will mold. Any moldy berries you      find should be culled out; mold ripens even more quickly      than your fruit.<br />    </p>     <h3>CURRANTS AND GOOSEBERRIES</h3>     <p>      The <em>Ribes</em> family are hardier than almost all other      fruit-bearing plants, which explains the popularity of      these easy-to-grow bushes in northern Europe, where fresh      fruit is often hard to come by. In America, on the other      hand, the <em>Ribes</em> are not very popular. Which is      unfortunate, because sun-ripened currants and gooseberries      are fabulous.    </p>    <p>      Part of their sad lack of popularity in this country stems      from the fact that the berries don't lend themselves too      well to machine picking and the ripe fruit is hard to ship.      Another reason is that the family is an alternate host for      white pine blister rust and should not be planted near      these trees; thus there are strict limitations on      interstate shipping of <em>Ribes</em> in some areas.    </p>    <p>      But the first reason is a strictly commercial one, and the      second can be easily taken into consideration unless your      spread is very small. So why not some good <em>Ribes?</em>    </p>		<h3>PROPAGATION</h3>    <p>      Both currants and gooseberries can be propagated from      cuttings. Currants take root a little more readily than      gooseberries. For your initial order, particularly of      gooseberries, the plants should be American varieties.      European ones, the subject of more intensive breeding and      care, give bigger yields, but there is often some      difficulty getting them to take well here. Still, if your      nursery stocks them, a few imported bushes are definitely      worth trying too.    </p>    <p>      Gooseberries come in red, yellow, and green varieties. The      green are actually a translucent white when ripe. The red      are the sweetest. Personally, I prefer the green; they're      the most tart, and make refreshing summer eating. Currants      come in various shades of red, black, and white. Grow some      of each. Incidentally, currants make the world's best      homemade wine.    </p>    <p>      For gooseberries, order well-rooted one-year-old stock.      Two-year-old stock is even better, but if you buy these you      have to make sure you're dealing with a good      nursery-which actually you should do in any case.      Quick-buck operators will sell all their good stock as      first-year plants, culling the others to let them grow to      second-year plants. You get two-year-old stock, all right,      but the worst of the lot. The same holds true for currants,      although these, being sturdier, are likely to fare better      as two-year-olds than the gooseberries.    </p>    <h3>LOCATION</h3>    <p>      Gooseberries and currants both prefer a heavy, even clay      soil to a loose, sandy one. This is particularly true in      more southern areas, where the heat retention properties of      sandy soil can seriously impair the plant growth. Their      roots are spreading, but quite near the surface, which      intensifies the heat problem. On the other hand, this      shallow root structure also permits the bushes to be grown      in areas of too much ground moisture for other fruit      plants, as long as drainage for the top six inches of soil      is good.    </p>    <p>      Both plants have the added advantage of doing well on      locations too windy for other berries, such as hilltops. In      fact, areas exposed to a fair amount of wind are better for      them, because good wind prevents mildew, an otherwise      common problem, with gooseberries in particular. The bushes      are so windhardy that they are often planted as a windbreak      for other plants on an exposed side of a garden. Northern      light is preferred.    </p>    <p>      Currants and gooseberries may also be planted in areas of      partial shade where other fruit plants will not bear. This      is an especially good idea in areas of hot summers where      the tender surface roots might otherwise be scorched.      Remember the mildew problem, however; the gooseberries will      need good air drainage along with their shade.    </p>    <p>      One absolutely crucial factor is the location of any stands      of pine, yours or your neighbors. <em>Never</em> plant      these bushes within a minimum of a thousand feet from any      type of pine tree. White pine blister rust cannot spread      from pine to pine, but put currants or gooseberry bushes      together with white pines, and you risk not only wiping out      the entire white pine population, but even affecting other      varieties of pine. However, the spores cannot be      wind-carried more than a thousand feet, hence the spacing      rule, which, if followed, will adequately protect the local      pines.    </p>    <p>      The soil for currants and gooseberries should have a pH in      the vicinity of 7. Plenty of compost boosts yields. Lots of      potash should be used, and some nitrogen, but not too much      or you'll end up with more leaves than fruit. Therefore      don't use chicken or rabbit manure; other types are fine.    </p>		<h3>PLANTING</h3>    <p>      Currants and gooseberries are very early spring      bloomers.<br />    </p>    <p>      It's pretty hard to beat them to the gun. No matter how      early in spring you try to plant them, you'll disturb the      incipient flowers, so plant in fall instead. They lose      their leaves and enter the dormant stage in early autumn,      and thus the root system is given plenty of time to develop      before winter's severity overtakes the land. Bushes five      feet apart make a good planting layout, except for black      currants, which are larger than the others. They're usually      spaced seven feet apart instead.    </p>    <p>      Plant in soil that has been well mixed with potash-rich      compost, including wood ash and bone meal, setting the      stock slightly lower than they were in the nursery. If the      roots seem dry, moisten them down before planting, although      they're better off, of course, if not allowed to dry out in      the first place. Trim off any broken roots. Pack the soil      down fairly tightly around each plant. Trim all branches      longer than ten inches.    </p>		<h3>MULCHING</h3>    <p>      Give the transplant plenty of surrounding mulch except for      the field-mice circle of six inches' radius or so that you      leave free where the plant breaks ground. The mulch must      cover an area sufficient to protect the spread-out, shallow      root system. A four-foot doughnut of it around each bush is      good. Enlarge the doughnut as the plant grows.    </p>    <h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      The best time for pruning is early winter. First trim off      weak branches and those lying close to the ground. In      Europe gooseberries are sometimes shaped to form small      trees eventually. This can often be done to good advantage,      although the method is rarely used in America. Try it on      one of your sturdier bushes and match the yield against the      bush-pruned ones. In any case, gooseberry bushes should      always be trimmed so there is an open space toward the top,      where they sometimes tend to develop a tight head. The      breathing space aids in mildew prevention.    </p>    <p>      Currants and gooseberries bear most profusely on their      second- and third-year growth. Once your bushes are      established, make a habit of trimming off all the      four-year-old wood among the branches - you'll recognize it      by its thickness. Remember to trim old branches all the way      back to the ground. On a mature bush you want to leave four      branches from each previous year's growth, except for a      black currant, whose two-year-old wood should predominate.      All these branches will have laterals of varying lengths.      The laterals should not be cut back unless they've been      injured. Trim for symmetry and you'll be trimming for best      yield. All snippings, particularly those that don't look      healthy, should be burned immediately. Never let them lie      in the mulch.    </p>    <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      White pine blister rust should be no problem if you plant      your bushes the appropriate distance-a thousand feet      or more-from any white pines in the area. The same      type of anthracnose that affects the other cane fruits may      affect currants and gooseberries; it is treated the same      way as for the bramble bushes. Cane borers can be a      nuisance. A cane that wilts early toward its tip is      probably infested with them. Cut back until you find the      culprits, and burn the whole cutting.    </p>		<h3>HARVESTING</h3>    <p>     The      harvesting season for currants extends over a month or      more. If you want them for jelly, do your berry-picking      before they're quite ripe because the pectin content is      higher then.    </p>    <p>      Ripe ones for eating are, of course, picked much sweeter.      Harvest currants in clusters, like grapes. Don't try to      strip off the individual berries by the handful or you'll      end up with pulp in your hands.    </p>    <p>      Gooseberries ripen almost a bushelful at a time, which is      convenient. You'll have to harvest only a couple of times      in season, and once you've tackled this thorny job you'll      be glad the ripening span isn't as long as that for      currants. Some pickers don heavy canvas gloves and strip a      whole branch at a time. This works fine on the greener      berries wanted for gooseberry jam, provided you don't mind      some pulpy squashed berries.<br />    </p>    <h3>GRAPES</h3>    <p>      Grapes will grow in almost all temperate and many      subtropical regions. European grapes can really be      cultivated only in California and Arizona; the native      American varieties, on the other hand, will probably thrive      wherever you do. And well worth cultivating they are.      Although I've never found grapes to rival some      morning-chilled ones I picked south of Herat,      Afghanistan-which certainly must vie with the      ambrosia of the gods-almost any grape is a delight to      the palate.    </p>    <p>      The three major species of grapes grown in America are the      <em>Vitis labrusca,</em> an eastern variety of slip-skinned      grape typified by the Concord, which is also grown in the      west central region; the <em>V</em> <em>rotundifolia</em>      <em>,</em> a southern grape whose name rhymes with      magnolia, typified by the muscadines, scuppernong, for      instance; and <em>V.</em> <em>vinifera</em> <em>,</em> the      European wine grape grown almost exclusively on the West      Coast, typified by the emperor and Johannisberger Riesling.    </p>    <p>      For a permanent contribution to the world around you,      grapevines are a good start. A well-tended arbor will      outlive you by many years, giving pleasure to all. And for      a personal experience that's hard to beat, take a couple of      real friends, a wheel of homemade goat cheese, your own      fresh-baked wholewheat bread, and a bottle of wine from      last year's crop out to the sun-drenched, fragrant arbor in      grape-picking season and harvest the morning away.    </p>   <h3> PROPAGATION</h3>    <p>      Grapevines are usually propagated from cuttings or by      layering. Southern muscadines are a little more difficult      than other species. Whichever you choose, for your initial      planting you should purchase one-year-old stock, from a      local nursery, if possible, to assure easiest      acclimatization. Surprisingly enough, a year-old vine with      a good root system will fruit as quickly as a two-year-old      transplant. What you are looking for is not length of the      roots, but their number. You want a good, solid, bushy root      system.    </p>    <h3>LOCATION</h3>    <p>      Grapes prefer very well-drained, warm soil rich in organic      matter, and plenty of sun and air circulation. For these      reasons they are often grown on hillsides, particularly      those with southern exposure. If you have a sunny hillside,      fine. If not, you can put your grapes on the south side of      the house. But don't train grapes up the walls like ivy;      this would increase the likelihood of early spring frost      damage.    </p>    <p>      Open arbors are ideal. Face the open ends so that the      prevailing winds run through the arbor, not up against it.      In some areas arbors are used as summer shelters for      tractors and other farm equipment. They suit the purpose,      but I'd rather have the outdoors dining room. Although      grapevines grow rapidly, you won't need to build an arbor      for them until your second or third year. You will,      however, have to stake out the plants with the future arbor      in mind.    </p>    <h3>PLANTING</h3>    <p>      The best pH for grapes is 6 to 7, or almost neutral soil.      Plant in the spring, but plow or dig up the land deeply the      previous fall if possible. A cover crop of rye turned under      before setting out the vines is an excellent way to boost      the organic matter in the soil. Follow the rye crop with      ground rock phosphate and granite rock or green sand spread      liberally over the whole area to be used. If your soil is      too acid, limestone will be needed as well.    </p>    <p>      For an arbor, plant the grapevines six to eight feet apart.      For vines to be trellis-trained, ten or twelve feet is      often better spacing if you have the room. You may think      your young vineyard looks a bit sparsely settled at first,      but two prolific vines have been known to cover a      twenty-four-foot arbor all by themselves.    </p>    <p>      Pruning back grapevine roots to seven inches encourages the      development of feeder roots. If you look carefully, you'll      notice the vines seem to have a double set of roots: those      just about at the soil line and a second pseudo-crown that      spreads out below. The top ones are feeder roots; they run      quite close to the surface, like those of your cane fruits.      The second group of roots go quite deep, some to eight or      ten feet. By forcing the development of the feeder roots      and using rich compost and mulch, your plants are given a      much better start. If there seems to be just one layer of      roots to a vine, don't worry; in some cases it's very      difficult to distinguish between the two types of roots.      Plant the vine anyhow.    </p>    <p>      But first, while you're pruning the roots, cut back all the      canes except two right dawn to the crown. Even these two      should be pruned enough to leave only two or three buds on      one and a single bud on the other, unless you want your      vine to grow high quickly, reaching for, say, the top of an      arbor. In that case, cut the two canes back to leave eight      buds. As soon as the new shoots are half an inch long,      prune off all but the top two.    </p>    <p>      Spread the roots out on a layer of topsoil in a hole a foot      and a half in diameter and as deep as the longest root,      making sure the bottom set is freely spaced. Tamp it down      with some soil cover, then spread the surface roots, just      as evenly. Cover with additional soil until you reach the      level of the lowest cane bud. The new plant should sit a      little lower in the ground than it did at the nursery. Help      it settle in with a bucket of water poured slowly into the      hole, making a damp ring around the transplant.    </p>		<h3>MULCHING</h3>    <p>      Mulch each vine with six inches of good compost, leaving      the plant to grow out of a volcano-like depression. Don't      bring the compost right up against the cane, however. For      mature plants, half a foot of alfalfa hay mulch is      excellent.    </p>    <h3>PRUNING AND TRAINING</h3>    <p>      Much is made of the mysteries of pruning and training      grapevines. There are head-pruned, cordon-pruned, and      canepruned vines, not to mention all the combinations      thereof. Volumes have been written about them. Just to      mention a few, there are the Chautauqua, Fan, Umbrella,      Umbrella-Kniffin, Hudson River Umbrella, Single-Trunk,      Two-Trunk, Six-Cane Kniffin, Munson .... Whichever do you      use?    </p>    <p>      Well, why not simply forget about the whole complex matter?      Unless you intend to establish a major vineyard, your      grapes can do without all the fine distinctions.    </p>    <p>      Stick with the basic principles. First, do your pruning in      late winter. Secondly, a vine will not bear a full crop      till it's five years old, so leave it a little more      permanent wood each year, building a sturdy vine. Thirdly,      fruit is borne on the current season's growth, not the      preceding season's, as with your bramble fruits. Therefore      you're not going to reduce the yield by pruning back the      canes each year. However, the buds on the previous season's      canes are what produce the new bearing growth, so you must      leave some buds. As a general rule, leave one bud on canes      the diameter of a pencil, two on those the diameter of your      thumb, and two on those you're not sure of. If you do want      to follow a specific system, the Four-Cane Kniffin is      probably the best bet for the small grape grower.    </p>    <p>      However you prune them, your grapevines will need tying.      Binding them up serves several functions. For one thing,      the vines grow where you want them to, making for easier      picking and covering your arbor instead of trailing along      the ground. For another, tying minimizes wind damage, which      could otherwise be severe. Lastly, it prevents the      formation of contorted trunks that lessen the yield. Don't      use wire to bind the vines to their supports. It may look      perfect, but it will cut into the bark and girdle the arms.      Jute twine or some other soft string is good. Two-ply or      stronger is best; it will cut less. Wrap the twine several      times around the arbor poles or cross-wires, then prop a      cane up against it and knot it, loosely but so it cannot      untie-the old granny knot is fine. Be careful not to      break the canes when tying them; don't use more ties than      necessary, and space out growing canes evenly.    </p>        <p>      It's the second winter's pruning that begins to shape up      your vines. If you're using the Four-Cane Kniffin system,      the first year's growth is cut back in winter to within a      few buds of the initial pruning. The second year you will      need a stake for the vine to climb up if you don't have the      arbor ready yet. Let the plant leaf out fully to insure      that it retains its health. Wait and winter-prune, again      leaving a little more wood than the vine had before. Each      of the main canes (the big fat ones) should be left with      ten buds. All laterals except one should be cut off each      cane. These laterals will become main canes the following      year. Train the laterals to keep growing along the      horizontal. The new spring growth the third year can then      be trained vertically to completely cover the arbor. Your      best bunches of grapes will be found around the fifth to      eighth nodes, or leaf junctures, of the new growth.      Anything beyond that can be cut off.    </p>   <h3> PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      One of the most common problems the small vineyard owner      faces is "mummy grapes," or black rot. The grapes decide to      try and become raisins on the vine. But it doesn't work;      they rot from the inside out, acquiring a wizened,      shriveled look. This fungus disease is best controlled by      immediate removal of the offending bunch before the fungi      can spread. You can't cure it, you can only minimize the      effects.    </p>    <p>      Japanese beetle was once a frequent arbor plague. It can be      controlled by introducing milky spore disease, which leaves      the grapes unaffected but wipes out the beetle.    </p>    <p>      Healthy rootstock and the precautions mentioned above      should take care of any problems you might have. Grapes as      a rule are not troubled by many diseases and pests.    </p>    <h3>HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      Let your grapes ripen on the vine till stems begin to dry      slightly, the aroma is superb, and they are at their      sweetest. Since you're not using all sorts of chemical      sprays and fertilizers, you can sample them right off the      vine.    </p>    <p>      Pick grapes in the cool of the morning. Clip the bunches      off with scissors rather than trying to twist the stems      loose. Put the clusters in a shady spot, inside the arbor,      for instance, as you harvest. Try not to eat more than      three pounds while picking or you might be sorry.<br />    </p>    <h3>STRAWBERRIES</h3>    <p>      Although they can be cultivated almost all over the United      States, strawberries from cooler areas are the tastiest.      Florida strawberries are popular among supermarket shoppers      because they're available in the wintertime and they look      good, but as to their taste, well, even if you live in      Florida you'll be surprised how superior your home-grown      fresh-from-the-garden ones are.    </p>    <p>      As to the varieties 6 choose from, even if you tried a      different one for every plant in a hundred-foot row, you'd      barely scratch the surface. Experiment to find out which      ones suit you best, but remember to get some each of early,      midseason, and late varieties to insure the longest      possible harvest. Everbearing berries produce three crops,      but, as with everything else when you try to make too much      of a good thing, these crops are often second-rate.      Besides, they take much more work watering,      blossom-pinching, etc. Stick with a triumvirate of the      regulars.    </p>    <h3>PROPAGATION</h3>    <p>      Strawberries can be grown from seed, but this is usually      done only commercially in an attempt to increase even      further the number of varieties available. For garden      propagation, the plant is considerate enough to send out      runners, which develop into new plants. In selecting      plants, always buy ones certified virus- and disease-free,      and you're more than halfway home with a good crop.    </p>  <h3> LOCATION</h3>    <p>      Strawberries need rich, light soil full of organic matter.      A pH of 5.5 to 6 is good, since they like earth that's a      bit acid. Proper drainage is necessary to minimize disease.      Slope-planting is excellent; halfway up a northern hill      will minimize the chance of flower destruction by a late      frost, if this is a problem in your region. Remember to      plant with the contour if the slope is at all steep. Full      sun and placement away from trees, grape arbors, or other      producers of competitive surface roots is a must, as is      plenty of ground moisture, particularly during fruiting.    </p>    <h3>PLANTING</h3>    <p>      Very early spring, on a cloudy day, is the best time to      plant strawberries. Start with a hundred plants and you'll      have five to six hundred yielding ones the next season.    </p>    <p>      Prepare the land the previous fall by digging up a row to a      depth of one foot. Incorporate as much compost and manure      as you can-, up to 50 percent of the total volume if      possible. But remember, the compost should be acidic. Don't      use lime unless the pH is well below 5.5. Although the      roots will not often penetrate to the one-foot level, this      depth of preparation aids in water retention. Also, since      the soil is loose to this depth, the roots will grow deeper      than they normally do, producing sturdier plants. Sow the      bed to a winter cover crop of rye beforehand.    </p>    <p>      To minimize disease problems strawberry plants should not      be set in soil that within the past two years grew      tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplant, raspberries, or      corn. Taking this precaution will minimize the chances of      both verticillium wilt and root lice.    </p>    <p>      Plant at intervals of one and a half feet with four feet      between rows. To take, the roots should be quite moist when      planted. If they look at all dry, soak them in a tray of      water for half an hour before planting. While you work in      the field, keep all the plants covered with wet cloth until      you set each one, to insure that they don't dry out. The      crown must be set into the soil just as deep as it was      before. Too high or too low a level will mean the end of      your plant. The roots should be evenly spread out and the      soil on top of them packed down quite firmly.    </p>    <p>      A quick test of how you're doing with your planting is to      go back to a plant you set a few minutes earlier, take hold      of one leaf, and give it a quick, sharp tug. If the plant      comes up, you didn't pack the soil enough. If the leaf      snaps off its stem, you're all right, Jack.    </p>    <p>      Douse each plant heavily for its baptismal watering. If the      weather seems particularly dry the day you're planting,      snip off 10 to 25 percent of the lower leaves, in order to      aid moisture retention by cutting down on leaf      transpiration.    </p>        <p>      As strawberry plants grow, they send out runners that      develop new plants. These can be trained in specific      patterns for a larger yield. Simply anchor the runners with      a bit of earth to keep them growing in the right direction.      Planting more strawberries than you expect to harvest and      just trimming off some of the runners in not too systematic      a fashion also works fine. Just cut the runners once an old      plant has borne its fruit. When an old plant stops bearing,      dispose of it.    </p>    <h3>MULCHING</h3>    <p>      The strawberry was one of the first plants to benefit from      the idea of mulching. Along with all its other beneficial      effects, mulch prevents the berries from touching the      ground, keeping them in better shape. Mulch yours with      straw right after planting. If the mulch later prevents the      runners from taking root, nudge the mulch aside beneath      each new runner and show it the way to the soil. If there      is low snowfall in your area and winter temperatures fall      below 25°F. for any length of time, mulch your plants      for the winter with six to eight inches of straw after the      first frost, when the plants will be completely dormant. If      you're assured of plenty of snow, it will work just as well      for insulation. Remove the straw blanket in spring when the      days warm up and the strawberries look as if they're about      ready to grow again. That is to say, they will have begun      to leaf out, but the leaves, without the sun, will be      yellow. Just gently more the mulch clear of each individual      plant and let it lie.    </p>        <h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      Strawberry plants don't need pruning the way your other      berries do. However, the first year they should have all      their blossoms removed so they won't bear. This insures      good rooting. The same procedure does not have to be      followed with plants propagated from the runners, since      they established their root system the first year of      growth, while still attached to the umbilical cord of the      mother plant. In subsequent years pinch off most of the      runners before they produce plants, leaving only enough to      replace those that might die, or to permit a slight      expansion of your strawberry patch. Otherwise you'll be      flooded with plants. Also, pinching off excess runners will      increase the yield of the parent plants.    </p>    <p>      In fall, just before mulching for winter, the new plants      should be thinned or replanted so that there is a minimum      space of twelve to sixteen inches between all plants.      Fertilize liberally and apply the winter mulch.    </p>    <h3>HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      Like most berries, strawberries are best picked in the cool      of the morning when they are at their peak flavor. Don't      pull, twist them gently from the stem when they look ripe.      Sample a couple, naturally. Some berries ripen with more      white than others. Tasting is the sure test.    </p>
