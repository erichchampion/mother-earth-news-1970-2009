                       <p>      Back in 1949 - before factory farming and the "pump      'em full of chemicals" school of agriculture blitzed the      country - a fellow named Jack Widmer wrote a little      book called <em>PRACTICAL ANIMAL HUSBANDRY.</em> Now that      manual wasn't what you'd call completely exhaustive, the      writing style wasn't the best and a few of the ideas it      advanced - such as confining laying hens in cages      - were later refined into the kind of automated      farming that so many of us are fighting against these days.    </p>    <p>      Still, <em>PRACTICAL ANIMAL HUSBANDRY</em> contained a good      deal of basic information that today's "homesteaders" all      too often need and don't know where to find. I'm pleased,      then, that the publisher of the book, Charles Scribner's      Sons, has granted me permission to reprint excerpts from      this out-of-print manual. I think that many of my readers      will find the following information both interesting and      informative. - MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Excerpts from <em>PRACTICAL ANIMAL HUSBANDRY</em> by Jack      Widmer are reprinted by permission of Charles Scribner's      Sons. Copyright 1949 by Charles Scribner's Sons.    </p>    <h3>» DUCK PRODUCTION</h3>    <p>      Ducks are much easier to raise than chickens or turkeys.      They are subject to few diseases, are sturdy enough to live      through a more variable brooding temperature than other      fowl, and if given half a chance will weigh from five to      six pounds at eleven weeks, an ideal butchering age for      that delicacy of delicacies, Roast Long Island Duckling.      Their feeding is a simple matter, their feeds easily mixed,      and the amateur agriculturist will have more encouraging      results from ducks than he will from most members of the      home barnyard.    </p>    <p>      True, it is almost essential for breeding ducks to have      access to some sort of water in which they may swim during      the breeding season for egg fertility is tremendously      increased if they have a good swimming hole; but this can      be supplied by either streams, lakes, or man-made pools      that need not be very large to accommodate all the ducks      that the average family will require for home consumption.      In the event that a swimming hole is not practical, then      the country dweller may purchase day-old ducklings and      fatten them without swimming facilities.    </p>    <p>      Ducks do not require elaborate housing arrangements (four      square feet per breeding duck is sufficient . . . three      square feet for fattening birds) and barrels, packing      crates or other waste material make excellent nesting      boxes. In moderate climates ducks will not require any but      natural shelter and the ducks themselves, beyond being a      bit on the noisy side, are interesting and intelligent      birds and give little worry in relation to their many      advantages.    </p>		<h3>BREEDS OF DUCKS</h3>    <p>      Ducks are divided into three major categories: [1] meat      ducks, [2] egg producers and [3] ornamental ducks. In this      work we will not be concerned with the third class for they      are used primarily in zoos, parks and country estates that      are interested in their ornamental attributes. However      class 1 and class 2 are of importance to those living in      the country.    </p>    <p>      The meat ducks are made up of the following breeds: Pekin,      Alesbury, Muscovy, Roen, Cayuga, Buff and Swedish. Of these      breeds the Pekin and Muscovy are considered the most      popular in the United States . . . the Pekin being the      mainstay in the duckling, industry of Long Island and other      Eastern States. The Muscovy is very popular in California,      Oregon and Washington (as well as in the Eastern States)      although many Pekins are also found on the Pacific Coast.      Both breeds are very satisfactory for the average American      locality and both produce excellent carcasses.    </p>    <p>      Breeds most suitable for egg production are the Runner      (White, Buff and Penciled), Buff and Khaki-Campbell. Of      these the Runner is by far the most popular and many duck      fanciers who are fond of duck eggs maintain a few of this      breed for the Runner is to the duck world what the White      Leghorn is to the chicken world.    </p>    <p>      Choice of breed will therefore depend on whether the      prospective duck raiser is interested in meat or eggs. Here      on Toowoomba, where we usually maintain upwards from twenty      ducks, we keep the Pekin and are supplied with all the      ducks that we require for the table as well as having a      number of surplus eggs that are consumed by the family.    </p>    <p>      The Muscovy is most popular in the Eastern States. This      breed comes in two varieties . . . the White and dark. They      are excellent fliers and require little care as they will      forage wide. They are quite good egg producers and in      contrast to the Pekin are good setters and will rear their      young with little attention. They have proven very useful      for the general farm and do not require swimming water for      egg fertility.    </p>		<h3>STARTING WITH DUCKS</h3>    <p>      We have two general methods of getting started with ducks:      [1] We may purchase day-old ducklings from a hatchery or      [2] we may purchase breeding stock, mate our ducks,      incubate and brood our own ducklings.    </p>    <p>      When we, started with our Pekins we purchased our original      stock as day-old ducklings, raised them to maturity and      saved the better females. We then traded some of our males      for drakes belonging to our neighbors (who had also      purchased Pekin ducklings, but from a different hatchery)      and we continued from there. However, some breeders prefer      to purchase mature ducks of breeding age and thus produce      their own eggs. This may be practical if water is available      for as has already been mentioned it is difficult to      produce fertile eggs without sufficient water for the      swimming of the breeding flock. If water is not available,      then day-old ducklings is the only answer.    </p>		<h3>DAY-OLD DUCKLINGS</h3>    <p>      Once the question of desired breed has been settled, and      contact has been made with a reputable hatchery for the      purchase of the ducklings, we are ready to undertake the      raising of our ducks. Numbers ordered will depend on space      available, how much time we wish to devote to our birds and      the number of ducks, eggs, or both that we are interested      in producing. We started with 25 ducklings (ordered from a      Wisconsin hatchery and flown air express) and we raised      every one of the 24 that were alive upon arrival.    </p>    <p>      Ducklings may be successfully placed under chicken hens in      brooding coops. However if hens are not available,      ducklings are the easiest of all fowl to raise with an      artificial brooder.    </p>        <p>      These brooders may be the same ones that we used for either      chickens or turkeys. Ducks are maintained at a temperature      of 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit for the first week, 80 to 85      the second and at about 75 the third, and from then until      the ducklings are six weeks old, they should be kept at      from 65 to 70 degrees. After that, ducklings require no      heat unless the breeder is situated in a very severe      climate where it might be prudent to allow the ducks a      little heat during cold nights for their seventh and eighth      week. Great care should be exercised in keeping the litter      in the brooder room dry and watering devices should be      arranged so that ducks cannot climb into them and get wet.      Under no circumstances should ducklings be permitted to      swim or to become wet before they are at least six weeks      old or until they are well feathered.    </p>		<h3>HOME-GROWN DUCKLINGS</h3>    <p>      Selection of breeding ducks is much the same as that of      breeding chickens. The ducks should be selected as being      truly representative of their breed and for their broad,      deep bodies. They should have straight breastbones, be of      good size and show considerable vigor.    </p>    <p>      A good Pekin female should produce about 120 eggs during      the laying season (from January through May) and the ratio      of drakes to females should be no wider than one to seven.      They should be allowed to roam in a fairly spacious pen,      have access to swimming water and should be kept in a      thrifty but not overly fat condition.    </p>    <p>      Eggs should be kept at a maximum temperature of 60 degrees      Fahrenheit between laying and setting and the sooner that      eggs are set the better. Pekin and Runner ducks seldom set      and few duck fanciers have found it practical to hatch      ducklings under their mothers. Instead, chicken hens are      used and they will incubate from 13 to 15 eggs handily.    </p>    <p>      Duck eggs hatch after 28 days for all the breeds except the      Muscovy which requires from 32 to 34 days, and inasmuch as      duck eggs require more moisture than chicken eggs they      should be sprinkled two or three times during the      incubation period and certainly just before the ducks are      ready to pip.    </p>    <p>      Hens should be confined to the incubating nest for the      first 24 hours after the ducklings start to hatch as a set      of duck eggs will not hatch as rapidly as will chicks and      the chicken hen may get off the nest prematurely with the      first of the hatch, leaving the rest to spoil.    </p>    <p>      For those duck fanciers who are interested in raising but a      few ducks each year it would not be practical to maintain      an incubator for artificial incubation. Instead (as in the      case of turkeys) it is recommended that fertile eggs be      taken to the commercial hatchery to have them custom      hatched.    </p>    <p>      After the ducklings are from 24 to 36 hours of age they are      removed from either the natural or artificial incubator and      are placed either under the hen (that is, shut up in a      brooding coop) or under the artificial brooder as already      described under "Day-old Ducklings"    </p>		<h3>DUCK FEEDING</h3>    <p>     Ducklings are fed as soon as they are placed under the      brooders and, unlike the turkey poult, there is no need to      worry about them learning to eat . . . they are hatched      hungry. Their ration for the first five days should be a      moist mash, fed on boards or shallow troughs and made up      something as follows:    </p>        <p>      Some small operators have found that they that they may      start ducklings on chick starter that has been made into a      wet mash, while others have been able to purchase duck      starter although this is not always obtainable in the      average community.Ducklings are fed all they will clean up      three or four times daily for the first four weeks and then      may be cut down to two feeds daily. Sand or grit, or both,      must be kept before them at all times and they should have      water available in deep enough pans so that they dip their      bills nearly to the eyes. This is important so that they      may clear their nostrils of mash. These watering devices      should be covered with a wire basket so that ducks will not      play in the water and thus make a mess of their litter.    </p>    <p>      After the first five to seven days, the ration may be      changed to a wet mash made up of the following:    </p>        <p>      This ration is fed until the ducklings are from six to      eight weeks of age at which time they are changed to a      fattening ration made up as follows:    </p>        <p>      To this ration should be added 10 percent (by volume) of      green feeds. These greens may be alfalfa, clover, young      corn, rye, cowpeas or whatever greens are available. They      should be cut into inch-long lengths and are very necessary      if rapid gains are to be made. For those who do not care to      mix their own rations, duck pellets may be purchased that      are made up of a balanced ration especially suited for duck      fattening. Naturally the expense of feeding will climb      considerably when these pellets are used and it must be      remembered that green feeds should be fed even when pellets      replace mash.    </p>    <p>      This fattening ration is fed until the ducks have reached      11 to 12 weeks of age at which time they should weigh from      five to six pounds and are ready for butchering.    </p>    <p>      Experience has taught us that it is far more economical to      butcher all the ducks at this prime age, for their      maintenance beyond that point is usually more detrimental      to quality than advantageous. They should therefore be      butchered, cleaned and wrapped in cellophane and placed in      the deepfreeze where they will keep from nine to ten months      with no appreciable loss in quality.    </p>    <p>      Those ducks that are to be used as breeders the following      year should be separated from the fattening ducks at about      eight weeks of age. Here we are interested mainly in a      growing rather than a fattening ration and they may be fed      a more reasonably priced ration as follows:    </p>        <p>      This mash should be mixed with about one-third of the bulk      being green feed and is fed until the laying season when      the following ration should be substituted:    </p>        <p>      This mash should also be supplemented with a third of the      bulk being greens.    </p>    <p>      Breeding ducks are fed this ration throughout the breeding      and laying season after which they should either be      butchered for home consumption or sold on the market.      Experienced breeders tell us that the keeping of breeders      after the first laying year is not economical as new      breeders may be selected from each year's crop of ducklings      . . . thus incorporating considerable saving in feed bills.    </p>    <p>      We here on Toowoomba are very fond of mature duck meat, and      although we butcher a number of our ducks for succulent      roast duckling at from five to six pounds, we do permit at      least half of our ducklings to grow into yearlings before      butchering. We admit that this is not the most economical      manner in which to handle ducks, for more mature animals      eat considerably more per pound of grain than do the      younger ducklings. However, we are willing to feed somewhat      longer for these mature carcasses.    </p>    <p>      Yet no matter which manner ducks are handled, the beginner      will do well to raise at least a dozen annually for they      will require very little attention, do not eat too much      expensive feed and will certainly supply the family with a      delightful change for the table.    </p>             <h3>» GOOSE PRODUCTION</h3>                 <p>      The domestic goose can be raised in any section of the      United States and once the mating question has been solved,      the amateur will experience little difficulty in their      production. They are a thrifty bird and if pasture is      available they will require little additional feed other      than an abundance of grass which they will harvest      themselves. In the event that pasture is not available they      will get along very nicely on grains and roughage.    </p>    <p>      Unlike most breeds of ducks, geese do not require water for      the fertilizing of eggs, although geese do considerably      better when they may swim. These birds require little if      any housing, are subject to few diseases and live to a ripe      old age. They are as easy to drive as a herd of milk cows,      and one trio of mature geese will produce all the goose      meat that the average family can ever consume. Geese make      more thrifty gains when they have enough space in which to      range most of the year - the more space the better      - however, excellent results have been obtained with      geese even though they are confined to limited enclosures.    </p>   <h3>BREEDS OF GEESE</h3>    <p>      Choice of breed will depend more on availability than any      other single factor. There are several excellent breeds      with the Toulouse, Embden, African, China and Egyptian      being the leading varieties. Perhaps the Toulouse and      Embden will be found as readily as any as they are very      popular in the United States and are found in all sections      of the country.    </p>    <p>      Both here in California, and formerly in Colorado, we have      kept with the Toulouse, and although we maintain but one      trio - one male and two females - we have had      excellent results in their production. The Toulouse is a      hardy bird, requires little if any shelter (in the average      climate) and is the largest of the breeds. The adult gander      will weigh up to 30 pounds, while the adult goose usually      weighs in the neighborhood of 20 pounds. The only criticism      we have to offer after several years with the Toulouse is      that they sometimes refuse to set. For this reason we have,      in the past few years, depended on a commercial hatchery      for the incubation of our goose eggs.    </p>    <p>      The Embden is also very popular in most sections of the      United States and although this variety is usually      considerably smaller than the Toulouse (a gander weighing      in the neighborhood of 20 pounds) they are better setters      and are said to be better mothers.    </p>    <p>      Of the other varieties, the China (both white and brown)      has proven most practical for small quantity goose      production and this breed is gaining in favor, especially      on the Pacific Coast.    </p>    <p>      Some, goose fanciers have obtained wild Canadian geese and      have crossed them with domestic varieties. The beginner      must be warned, that even though this cross makes for      excellent meat, all goslings produced by such a union are      sterile and therefore are of no value as breeders.    </p>    <h3>STARTING WITH GEESE</h3>    <p>      There are three methods of starting with geese: [1] Day-old      goslings may be purchased, [2] a pair of trio of mature      geese ready to breed may be obtained or [3] a setting of      fertile e. may be purchased and if setting chicken hens are      available they may be set under these hens. All three      methods are satisfactory . . . however availability of the      stock in question be the deciding factor.    </p>    <h3>DAY-OLD GOSLINGS</h3>    <p>      Goslings are not fed until they are from 28 to 36 hours old      and their first feed may be made up of stale bread that      been soaked in either water or milk, corn that has been      cracked and scaled or mash that is made up of four parts      corn one part middlings and soaked in either water or milk.      Green grass makes up most of the feed for both goslings and      mature geese and they will require only a very limited      amount during their entire growing period.    </p>    <p>      When the young goslings come from the hatchery they may be      successfully brooded under geese, chicken hens or under an      artificial brooder. The geese themselves are by far the      best for this purpose and each goose will look after from      14 to 16 goslings. If chicken hens are used they may be      given from 10 to 12 goslings depending on the breed and      size of the hens in question. After the hens have taken      care of the youngsters for two or three weeks the goslings      will get along nicely without them. As to artificial      brooders, this is most difficult, for young goslings should      be put directly on green range and when confined to brooder      houses their advancement is retarded considerably. If      however, it is necessarv to brooder the gosling= they      should be started at 95 degrees Fahrenheit for the first      week, 85 for the second, 75 for the third and then turned      out to range.    </p>    <h3>HOME-GROWN GOSLINGS</h3>    <p>      Geese can be most aggravating when one considers them from      a mating standpoint. Unlike most animals of the barnyard      kingdom, geese are by nature monogamous. Especially is this      true in the wild state where it is said that Canadian geese      mate but once and then for life. As any observant goose      hunter can testify, a Canadian gander who has lost his mate      will search for her continually and seldom mates again.    </p>    <p>      In domesticity, geese may mate more than once and often      trios are very successful . . . one male and two females.      Yet even here the gander will often select a favorite and      will fertilize her eggs while permitting his second mate to      live a life of celibacy. Then too, if pairs are kept, it is      not always a sure thing that they will care for each other      and many goose fanciers have found it necessary to shuffle      their pairs around until the proper combinations have been      attained. But even this has its advantages, for once mated,      pairs and trios will remain loyal to their mates for life      and will go on for years without any changes being      necessary.    </p>    <p>      Geese, as with all poultry, should be selected as      individuals for their size, nearness to breed type and      vigor. It is wise to keep medium-sized geese for breeders      for they seem to do better than the extra-large      individuals, and it is also advisable to purchase breeding      stock well in advance of the breeding season so that they      may become acquainted with their living quarters. In the      event that matings do not work out and that the gander      cannot be interested in the ladies in question, then there      is but one answer . . . roast gander.    </p>    <p>      Toulouse and Embden breeds will produce some offspring      during their second year. However, best results are      obtained with these heavier breeds during the third, fourth      and fifth years. The lighter breeds usually mature earlier      than these two mentioned and start reproducing at an      earlier age. After the sixth year has been reached      (regardless of breed) geese begin to taper off in both egg      production and fertility, and this problem must be settled      for each individual goose.    </p>    <p>      Geese usually lay from 25 to 30 eggs during the laying      season (January to May) and eggs should be taken from the      laying nests as they are laid (leaving at least two in the      nest for seed), for if all eggs are allowed to remain, some      geese will stop laying when they have produced what they      might consider a "set". Some producers set the first five      to seven eggs under a chicken hen, the balance under a      goose and then give all the goslings to the goose to raise.      This may be a dangerous practice, however, for many geese      will leave their nests during the incubation period and      chicken hens have been proven much more reliable.    </p>    <p>      Eggs that are set under chicken hens must be turned daily      for the eggs are too heavy for the hens to perform this      duty themselves and all eggs should be soaked in warm water      for a few minutes every four days. Goose eggs hatch in from      30 to 35 days and, as in the case of ducks, chicken hens      must be confined to their nests during the first 24 hours      after hatching begins so that all goslings will have a      chance to pip before the hen decides to leave the nest with      the first of the hatch. From this point forward, the care      of the goslings is the same as described under "Day-old      Goslings".    </p>    <h3>FEEDING OF GEESE</h3>    <p>      As has already been stated, grass is the main feed of geese      until they reach the fattening stage. After they have been      fed the mash ration described under "Day-old Goslings" for      the first two to three weeks, goslings will require little      in addition to grass. However, if geese are to be raised in      confinement and grass is not available, then a ration made      of two parts shorts and one part cornmeal or ground oats      may be fed. After six weeks they may be fed a wet mash made      up of equal parts of shorts, cornmeal or ground oats, with      an addition of five percent meat scraps. Whole grains may      be substituted for these mash feeds when the goslings have      completely feathered out. But this method of producing      geese is far more expensive than those that are permitted      to have access to grass.    </p>    <p>      Breeding geese should be fed during the winter when pasture      is no longer available, but care must be exercised so that      the breeders do not become too fat. When egg laying starts      they should be fed a mash made up as follows    </p>    <p>      3 parts bran or shorts    </p>    <p>      1 part cornmeal    </p>    <p>      1/2 part meat scraps    </p>    <p>      This mash is usually fed in the morning and both males and      females are fed. In addition, greens should be made      available and grit and oystershell are kept before the      breeding flock at all times.    </p>    <p>      Geese usually run on pasture until about six weeks before      the desired time of butchering when they are penned up and      fed a fattening ration of one-third shorts and two-thirds      cornmeal in the mornings, and a second ration made of equal      parts of corn and oats, or corn and barley, or oats and      barley. The morning feed is fed as a wet mash, the      remaining two feeds (noon and night) being fed dry. In      additon to these concentrates, some roughage or vegetable      greens are provided and geese fed in this manner will gain      from five to seven pounds during the six-week fattening      period.    </p>    <h3>THE FINISHED PRODUCT</h3>    <p>      All geese that are not to be maintained for breeding stock      should be butchered at their prime . . . usually at the      conclusion of the six-week fattening interval. Having been      fattened as described above they should be in excellent      condition and will carry considerable flesh. As with ducks      they keep in a deep-freeze unit at zero degrees Fahrenheit      for from nine to ten months without any appreciable loss in      quality. Feeding them beyond this prime period is a waste      of good feed. Those that are kept for breeders may be fed a      much lighter ration and are cut off from grain entirely as      soon as grass comes green in the spring.    </p>    <p>      Geese are slaughtered much as are ducks and turkeys (to be      taken up in a later chapter), and many people will wish to      save the feathers for pillows, down-lined jackets, etc. If      this is desired, the feathers should be kept separate from      the down and the quality of the down and feathers will be      in direct relationship to their care during the drying      period. They should be spread on paper in thin layers, kept      indoors and shaken frequently until thoroughly dried. Many      of the pillows found on Toowoomba have been stuffed with      home-grown down and there are none better.    </p>    <p>      Aside from supplying delicious meat for the table, and      valuable feathers, geese have a number of additional      attributes. They are excellent replacements for watch dogs      for they will raise a thunderous racket in the event of      prowlers. They are interesting birds to have on the farm      and they become very affectionate and are one of the most      friendly of all the home barnyard animals.    </p>

Pekin ducks require swimming water if they are to reproduce... however, Muscovy ducks do not need water. Both breeds, however, do much better when swimming is available. Size of swimming pool will depend on number of ducks kept... however, it is important that draining facilities are supplied as the swimming pool should be cleaned regularly as needed.
