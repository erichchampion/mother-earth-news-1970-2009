                    <p>      Normally a bad or misleading article on rabbit raising      wouldn't bother me . . . but three?    </p>    <p>      Now, please don't get the impression that I'm down on      MOTHER. On the contrary, I think you have an excellent      publication that provides me and my Peace Corps volunteer      friends with a lot of interesting reading and some good      ideas. It bothers me, therefore, when an otherwise fine      magazine puts out poor information on a subject I know      something about.    </p>    <p>      My credentials as a rabbit expert? Well, first, I've had      extensive experience with raising these animals in the      United States and three African countries. Since my      background is in microfarming techniques, I've devoted a      lot of time to correctly run, inexpensive rabbit projects.      In fact, I've raised the critters commercially for years      and have written three books and a number of articles on      the subject. I think, then, that I ought to know bad advice      when I see it.    </p>    <p>      Let's begin with the reprint from the HAVE-MORE Plan in      MOTHER NO. 2, pages 50-51. I realize that you published      this material with a statement that some of the original      info was out of date . . . but, even when you add such a      warning, I'm not sure it's wise to print incorrect      information for MOTHER's eager readers.    </p>    <p>      Take this statement on the rearing of young by foster      mothers: "Wally rubbed a little Mentholatum on (the doe's)      nose so she couldn't smell the difference between her own      and the young one from another litter." Well, Wally      shouldn't have done that. Mentholatum really burns tender      tissue and you could actually peel a mother rabbit's nose      by using it. If you want an aromatic substance for this      purpose, peppermint oil from the drugstore is a better      choice.    </p>    <p>      In fact, though, scent of any kind is probably unnecessary      when you're transferring a litter. There's no need to      destroy the smell either of the human hand or of the dam      whose offspring are being moved, because does are not      choosy in this respect and don't distinguish among the      young even if they're of different colors. Evidently, when      the young to be adopted are moved to the foster mother's      nest and come in contact with her own litter and the      nesting material, any distinct scent, that might be      discernible to the doe is destroyed.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the young rabbits should not be over-handled and      some breeders suggest that those to be adopted be picked up      with a clean cloth or a piece of paper. Also, when      selecting litters for fostering, it's wise to watch      carefully for any evidence of infection among the young or      the does so the transfer won't become a means of spreading      disease.    </p>    <p>      I'd like to move on now to the HAVE-MORE Plan's suggestions      about feeding, which are as inaccurate as those about      handling the young. For example, rabbits don't need      "hayracks full of hay". Two feedings - grain in the      morning and greens in the evening - are all that's      necessary.    </p>    <p>      Concerning grain feeds, the article says that rabbits      "don't seem to like any grain that's ground up too fine" .      . . whatever that means. Not so! I've fed the beasties      poultry mash (formulated for laying hens) moistened with a      <em>little</em> water and have always finished out strong      litters of eight. If any of MOTHER's readers are using      poultry rations already, they might as well be giving this      chicken feed to their rabbits, too. Generally 1/2 cup of      grain daily is sufficient for bucks and dry does, and 3/4      to 1 cup for pregnant or nursing females.    </p>    <p>      To balance their morning grain ration, the rabbits can be      fed fresh grass or other greens each night (when they eat      more and are more active). A liberal quantity should be      allowed (generally as much as the animals can consume by      morning). If stale greens are left in the cage the next      day, though, the food should be removed and less given the      following evening.    </p>    <p>      It's best to put green food in a simple chicken-wire holder      open at the bottom and top. This container is placed on the      outside of the hutch door . . . which should have an      opening near the bottom of the feeder through which the      rabbits can pull the grass. Such an arrangement is much      better than heaping a pile of greens on the floor where      they quickly become fouled with urine and pellets.    </p>    <p>      Remember that grass/weed feeding is how you keep your cost      of production down. Greens are cheap - often free      - and once the rabbits get used to them, they'll eat      a lot and reduce your overall expense for feed. (Start the      animals slowly on this food and increase the amount over a      couple of weeks.) On many projects I've been involved with      here in Ethiopia - and earlier in Nigeria -      rabbits were maintained in good breeding prime on the diet      I've outlined: 1/2-3/4 cup of grain in the morning and all      the greens they could eat overnight.    </p>    <p>      There are other blatant mistakes in the HAVE-MORE article,      but let's end with its suggestion for hutch management. The      Robinsons say, "We keep our metal hutch in the barn. We      clean it out once a week, keep plenty of straw on the floor      and in the next box." This is very poor practice, as well      as being too much work. For the best sanitation and      prevention of hutch burn, coccidiosis and other diseases,      the animals' quarters should be single-tiered and provided      with a floor of 1/2-inch wire mesh.    </p>    <p>      To compound the HAVE-MORE Plan's errors, further      misinformation on rabbit housing appeared not long      afterward in MOTHER NO. 6, under the title "Pequoda's      Rabbit Hutch". Even if Pequoda <em>has</em> been living in      the woods for 30 years, his article was a disaster.    </p>    <p>      The sketch accompanying Pequoda's piece (on page 49)      headed, "Here is an inexpensive coop with which you can      gain maximum results from rabbits." Well, it's nothing of      the kind and the author's calling a hutch a coop gives a      clue to the of the advice.    </p>    <p>      First of all, I don't see how such a building could be      called "inexpensive" . . . all that black building paper,      shingle cement, etc., just aren't needed. And as for      "gaining maximum results", the sketch shows a two-unit      hutch . . . one for the buck, I suppose, and the other for      the doe. Now, I can't believe that anyone would want to      start with only two compartments, when you can build a      considerably cheaper and better three-unit hutch for half      the effort and expense. What's more, three animals are just      as cheap as two considering building costs for the hutch,      the meat raised from the feed, etc. Also, two does are a      benefit in that they'll provide the buck with more exercise      (fat males are not good breeders) and will permit a      staggered breeding program to insure meat on the table year      round.    </p>    <p>      One final comment on the Pequoda hutch: I'm very much      surprised that Mr. Peterson likes to bend over every time      he breeds, inspects or feeds his animals. Rabbit shelters      should be waist high for easy and practical management.    </p>        <p>      You see, MOTHER, printing this kind of information is      giving a <em>lot</em> of eager homesteaders a false start      in an amazingly easy practice.    </p>    <p>      I'll finish my remarks with some comments on the excerpt      from Grow It! in MOTHER NO. 15 (pages 18-24). Now, this      article wasn't bad . . . it was the best of the three, but      still, unfortunately, by no means complete. Like the other      two pieces, Grow It! is especially misleading on the      subject of housing the animals.    </p>    <p>      The worst omission in Langer's advice is the failure to      mention the correct sizes for individual cages. This is a      serious matter, for I can't begin to tell you how many      people have failed with rabbits because they think these      animals need only a minimum of space. The truth is that the      project is doomed if the rabbitry is overcrowded.    </p>    <p>      Adequate space for rabbits varies with the breed: heavy,      medium and small. For medium-sized varieties, the space per      doe and nest box should be around 3 X 2-1/2 feet. The cost      of hutch building can be greatly reduced, though, if the      nest boxes are attached to the doe's cage to leave the      floor space completely available to the mother and the 6-8      young that will be sharing her quarters for several weeks.      (Though its dimensions were sufficient, by the way, the      nest box in the <em>Grow It</em> ! article was a bit too      elaborate. I much prefer a nail keg - or the model      I've drawn - for the purpose.)    </p>    <p>      While we're on the subject of nesting, I think Langer's      suggestion that clean scraps of cotton be provided for the      doe must have been left over from some former experience      with raising kittens. If straw is supplied about three or      four days before the female rabbit kindles, she'll make a      comfortable nest, and will also pull hair from around her      teats to make the bed even warmer and cozier. Save yourself      the time and trouble of offering her special materials.    </p>    <p>      After kindling, when the doe is ready to breed again,      she'll give signs of being in heat. Since a lot of people      aren't around their rabbits enough to catch these signals,      I thought I'd mention that the female can in fact be bred      any time (except for a couple of days before and after      estrus . . . but don't worry about that). If she's not in      heat, however, it may be necessary to restrain her by the      loose skin over the shoulders until the buck mounts. (He'll      get used to this help in no time.) Also, many breeders      assist in mating by sliding their free hand under the belly      of the doe and pushing the tail back with a finger on each      side of the vulva. Though such restraint is often not      necessary, it's useful when working with a nervous or young      female.    </p>    <p>      Just one last point about the <em>Grow It!</em> excerpt:      The automatic feeder was grossly imaginative, and I don't      understand the use of the screen bottom, which eventually      becomes a good resting place for stale or wet feed and the      grains that rabbits don't care for. Leave the screen out      and have the feeder easy to clean . . . or forget the whole      idea and use a heavy earthernware dish or bowl. A small      coffee can nailed to a piece of board also works well and      is cheap.    </p>    <p>      And speaking of automatic devices, I don't see why      saltwaterers weren't mentioned in any of the three      articles. They keep a constant supply of fresh water      available and are easy to make (see drawing).    </p>    <p>      In conclusion, there are many points of confusion in all      three articles, and I'm sorry my time doesn't permit me to      write a better, more comprehensive paper for you. I hope,      though, that this letter will prompt a more thorough review      of your contributions for accuracy and practicality. Don't      skim over your subject matter, but give the reader what he      will need to know to make a correct and knowledgeable      start.    </p>    <p>      Harlan H.D.
