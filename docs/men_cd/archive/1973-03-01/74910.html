                    <h3>      THE OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, CHAPTER 23<br />      DEVELOPMENT GOALS    </h3>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        KEN KERN      </h3>      <p>        Ken Kern, author of THE OWNER-BUILT HOME and THE        OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, is an amazing fellow and everyone        interested in decentralist, back-to-the-land, rational        living should know of his work. Back in 1948 he began        collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural        construction materials and techniques. He combed the        world for ideas, tried them and started writing about his        experiments.      </p>      <p>        Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's        articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN        REVOLUTION. Ken has also issued a three-year series of        pieces (called TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun        pit design of his has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.      </p>      <p>        This series of Ken Kern's work is being taken both from        OWNERBUILT HOME (already published) and OWNER-BUILT        HOMESTEAD (to be published). To give you advance chapters        of HOMESTEAD as they are written I have to break my        presentation of HOME on an irregular basis for which I        apologize. If you want HOME all at once it's available        right now direct from Ken Kern, Sierra Route, Oakhurst,        California 93644 f or $10.00.      </p>      <p>        -MOTHER      </p>    </div>    <p>      Reduced to basic terms, a productive homesteader must exert      some measure of <em>control</em> over his environment.      Implementing control requires various forms of physical      development, starting with <em>goals</em> and ending with      the <em>means</em> for achieving these goals. We are      constantly perceiving new needs and, to satisfy them, new      patterns of activity are adopted: new forms are created and      new means utilized. The developmental process is cyclic. We      start with the elimination of old, unsatisfactory forms and      patterns and-through the process of research, design      and production-we create new, more satisfying forms      and patterns. This process creates a rhythmic and balanced      continuity in homestead development. It is truly a work of      art.    </p>    <p>      Art is the making of things for the right reason. A      homesteader is an artist, therefore, to the extent that he      makes things according to the purpose of right reason, and      to the extent that he becomes fully involved in the making:      He uses his <em>whole person</em> . . . his body, his mind,      his choosing and his imagination. In other words, the      artist-homesteader first determines the <em>purpose</em> of      the thing made (the Moral Cause); second, he uses his      imagination to <em>design</em> an image of that thing which      is foreseen (the Formal Cause); third, he seeks an      understanding of the <em>materials</em> selected and used      to create the thing imagined (the Material Cause); and      finally, he selects the right <em>tool</em> to shape the      material into the form desired (the Efficient Cause).. Look      after the <em>causes</em> of things; the effects will take      care of themselves.    </p>    <p>      No one expressed these sentiments better than did Eric Gill      who, in a lecture on Work and Culture; had this to say      about man's sublimation into a "condition of intellectual      irresponsibility":    </p>    <p>      <em>How can it be agreed that food, clothing and shelter      shall be produced en masse, by machinery, and simply as      objects of merchandise, things produced solely for the      profit of investors of capital, and yet that, fed on      machine-made food, dressed in machine-made clothes, housed      in machine-made buildings, we shall be able in our leisure      hours-the hours when we are not working in the      factories-to produce and enjoy the products of human      cultivation?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>What an environment!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And environment is important, because it is as      necessary as the thing environed.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You cannot have responsible human beings in their      leisure time, if they are not responsible in their working      time.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>For working is the means to living, and it is life for      which we have responsibility.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You cannot have responsibility for your work unless you      have control over it.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You cannot have control over it unless individually or      collectively you own it.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We have destroyed the ownership and control, and      therefore the responsibility of the workers, and placed      these things in the hands of those who, by the nature of      the case, neither have, nor can have, any interest in the      matter other than a financial one.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And the evil recoils on them also.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>For what can be bought with the precious dividends but      the inhuman and degraded products of sub-human and degraded      workers and of a sub-human and inhuman method of      production.</em>    </p>    <p>      The subject of this and the following chapter deals with      setting up homestead development goals and implementing      these goals through developmental means. This twin      thought-and-work concern comprises the essential backbone      of the homestead process. It surely has more to do with a      homesteader's success or failure than any other single      factor. And it answers the probing questions: What to do?      And how to do it? That is, what type of homestead      program-in terms of crops, livestock, foods,      etc.-is to be set up; and what practices and      operations-in terms of time, energy and      labor-is to be adopted to achieve these goals. It is      hoped that these final two chapters provide the degree of      insight required for the culmination of a totally      satisfying, successful homesteading experience.    </p>    <p>      <em>Observation</em> becomes the starting point for any      systematic analysis of homestead goals: SURVEY BEFORE PLAN      BEFORE CONSTRUCTION. A thorough site observation is needed      before one can complete the form, "To Program Your      Homestead Development", found at the end of this book.      Before any amount of planning can take place one needs to      know exactly with what he has to work. Existing climatic,      soil, topography, and vegetation resources are as important      bits of information to the homestead-designer as are the      homesteader's personal needs, likes and dislikes.    </p>    <p>      M.G. Kains, author of many fine books on homesteading, has      this to say about the translation of observation into terms      of understanding, decision and action:    </p>    <p>      <em>One of the most profitable habits yon can form is      systematically, every day, to go over at least part of your      premises in a leisurely, scrutinizingly thoughtful way, and      the whole of it at least once each week throughout the year      to reap the harvest of a quiet eye and fill the granary of      your mind with knowledge of the habits of helpful and      harmful animals, birds and insects; to observe and      understand the characteristics of plant growth from the      sprouting of the seed through all the stages of stem, leaf,      flower, fruit and seed development; to note and interpret      the behavior of plants, poultry and animals under varying      conditions of heat and cold, sunshine and shade, drought      and wetness, fair weather and foul, rich and poor      feeding.</em>    </p>    <p>      One most important part of the survey process is      classification of homestead land capability. As used here      "capability" relates to best usages and limitations in      handling the land and not to mere productive capacity. In      most regions of the U.S. the Soil Conservation Service will      prepare anyone a land classification map, free of charge.      But an essential part of discovering a proper solution for      land use lies in the assemblage of facts for the      preparation of the map itself . . . each homesteader should      therefore be directly involved in preparing his own      inventory map.    </p>    <p>      The map is prepared by first walking over the land and      carefully examining all the significant variations in land      features. The soil variations can be simply determined by      using a soil auger. One brief sample of earth will indicate      topsoil depth, texture, permeability, available moisture      capacity, inherent fertility, organic matter content and      other characteristics that affect the use, management and      treatment of the land. Simple visual observation will      indicate slope of land, degree of erosion, wetness and      drainage. All of this information should be recorded on an      aerial map (oftentimes available from the Soil Conservation      Service) or on a U.S. Geological Survey map.    </p>        <p>      The Soil Conservation Service has categorized eight      land-capability classes, according to those properties that      determine the ability of the land to produce on a virtually      permanent basis. Classes range from the best and most      easily farmed land (Class I), to land which has no value      for cultivation, grazing or forestry but which may be      suitable for wildlife, recreation or watershed protection      (Class VIII).    </p>    <p>      Following the survey, the planning process involves      matching personal need to existing resources. It is here      that first failures occur: Too often limited resources are      utilized to satisfy unrealistic needs. Or the balance and      rhythm of slow growth is superseded by a more impatient      <em>tour de force.</em> Remember, it takes time to organize      and operate a homestead. At any given moment a homesteader      may still be far from an optimum level of management, or      from the ultimate goals for which he is striving. Even      goals themselves change over a homesteader's life cycle. A      dynamic approach is therefore required.    </p>    <p>      One of my favorite, long-term but still incompleted      projects is the formulation of a self-test for potential      homesteaders, to determine homestead abilities, probable      .success and failure. The test is self-scoring and should      go far in at least determining probable dropouts before      their own tragic discovery of ineptitude. This      self-appraisal is divided into three categories: an      evaluation of a homesteader's <em>character</em> . . . his      interest and attachment and patience to deal with plants      and animals; his <em>physique . . .</em> stamina to handle      the extra work, and his <em>motivation . . .      willingness</em> to give up time on a regular basis for      chores and homestead maintenance.    </p>    <p>      The fact that homesteading is a family affair somewhat      complicates the formation of a self-test of this nature . .      . the lack or presence of some essential attribute in a      homesteader's background may be compensated for by      characteristics found in his wife (or husband), or in the      children.    </p>    <p>      Homestead vocational guidance programs are more easily      organized and deal primarily in three areas: tests for      proficiency, evaluation of personal characteristics, and      some indication of past experience and performance in      homestead activities.    </p>    <p>      Agribusiness economists have been studying the attributes      and characteristics of "good" and "poor" farmers since 1929      when the first questionnaire by the Bureau of Agricultural      Economics was published. It is interesting to compare the      10 most significant factors in determining financial      success, established by this early study, with those      attributes found to be important in a study made 23 years      later:    </p>        <p>      The purpose of studying good and bad farmer attributes, by      the various college departments of agricultural economics,      was done primarily to benefit landlords and their farm      managers . . . as an aid to seek the best farm tenants.      Bankers and other creditors are also aided by these      questionnaires in the help received for evaluating the      personal characteristics of prospective borrowers.      Subsistence-level landholders can effect little assistance      from such "public" institutions. In only a small way do      these studies relate to the self-actuating,      owner-builder-homesteader. In one study (University of      Illinois, 1949) 360 questionnaires were filled out by      farmers describing the attributes they felt constituted a      <em>poor</em> farmer. Some of the attributes associated      with poor farming practices seem to qualify that farmer for      homesteading, like the comment made by one farmer      describing attributes of his poor farmer neighbor: "Neither      whiskers, nor weeds, nor uncastrated pigs annoy him."    </p>    <p>      Actually, there has been only one period in American      history when a public agency was established specifically      to aid the poor farmer, subsistence-homesteader class. This      was during the Great Depression when President Roosevelt      started the Farm Security Administration. Quite early in      its operation the FSA challenged the cheap labor      "plantation" system in the South, and threatened      established "farm" and landlord interests in its effort to      deal comprehensively with rural poverty. Destitute farmers      were taught cooperative marketing techniques and self-help      farmstead enterprises. Even cooperative farmstead      communities were established (a total of 13, throughout the      U.S.) which further threatened our free-enterprise.      private-land-ownership way of life.    </p>    <p>      The demise of the FSA was wrought by our conglomerate      agricultural administration . . . from the Secretary of      Agriculture to the County Agent. I say "conglomerate"      because a little study of the U.S. farm structure will show      its interrelatedness. The powerful American Farm Bureau      Federation, for instance, is a direct outgrowth of the      County Agent system. The Extension Service is but one      segment of this public bureaucracy which actually serves as      a bureaucracy of a private organization . . . the Farm      Bureau. These forceful bureaucracies, along with their      counterpart, the land-grant agricultural colleges, were all      originally promoted by the omniscient U.S. Department of      Agriculture . . . and the whole kit and caboodle is      financed by the taxpayer and controlled by agribusiness.    </p>    <p>      Agribusiness, usually in the form of a      corporate-conglomerate-absentee-landlord, uses the      tax-funded agricultural research of Federal and State      agencies and hides behind tax laws originally set up to      benefit the poor farmer . . . only to further drive him out      of business. In 1950 there were 5-1/2 million farms in the      U.S., with an average size of 215 acres. In 1970 there were      3 million farms, with an average size of 380 acres. The      farm situation here in California is probably the worst in      the nation. A big company like Tenneco exacts a      81.5-million-a-year subsidy for not growing crops! Such      multi-thousand-acre companies use federally subsidized      irrigation water in direct violation of the 1902      Reclamation Act . . . which limits use of such water to      farms no larger than 160 acres so as to prevent monopoly      land ownership!    </p>    <p>      So the small landholder can expect little assistance from      the County Agent or the land-grant college . . . they are      fully immersed in      plant-and-animal-diseaseinsecticide-fungicide-herbicide      crop-picking machinery research for agribusiness. The      American Farm Bureau Federation people are in state and      federal capitols lobbying against some      destitute-migrant-minimum-wage-right-to-strike Chicano for      the benefit of some absentee fat cat. And bureaucratic      Department of Agriculture administrators disperse monies      and direct the policies for an ever more powerful      agribusiness. Given a choice, the Department of Agriculture      favors bigness: power reserves from the federally      subsidized TVA, for example, can produce either nitrate or      phosphate fertilizers. Nitrates are traditionally the poor      farmers' fertilizers, but prosperous farmers benefit more      from phosphates. You guessed it, phosphates are produced by      the TVA.    </p>    <p>      As I perceive it, grass-roots leadership in the productive      homestead movement can take direction from either or both      of two possible routes . . . if, indeed, homesteading is      ever to be thought of as a significant, viable, alternative      lifestyle for more people than those of the counterculture.      First, the cooperative homestead concept fostered by the      Farm Security Administration must be modernized,      reevaluated and reconstituted. The physical, social and      economic ramifications of the homestead community will be      the subject of my following book, <em>THE OWNER-BUILT      COMMUNITY.</em>    </p>    <p>      Secondly, regional learning centers-homestead      schools, if you will-need to be established      immediately. I envision five such centers throughout the      U.S., and at this writing the first such center seems close      to realization here in California. Recruiting the necessary      expertise to operate such a plant has already begun here.      Many things might happen at a homestead school besides the      obvious learning of essential skills. The center can become      a regional information clearinghouse; a land location      service can be maintained for prospective homesteaders;      certain experimental methods and processes associated with      living on the land can be demonstrated or even initiated.      Besides being an experimental learning center, an      individualized consultation service could be made available      from the center's team of experienced instructors . . .      experts in everything from building, gardening, animal care      and land development to home food processing and craft      production.    </p>    <p>      My Homestead Planning Program offered at the end of this      book is one other important adjunct to our proposed      learning center. It is designed to operate as a mail-order      service, "on location" at our future school or in direct      relation with the homestead site.    </p>    <p>      One of my earliest homestead experiences clearly      demonstrated the value and need of instruction in basic      skills. In the 1950's I happened to be visiting the School      of Living center in Ohio. John Loomis was putting up hay      and I had occasion to assist him in this seemingly routine      chore. John was one who felt that "one good head is better      than a hundred strong hands", and he proceeded to instruct      me in the fine art of loading the ubiquitous hayfork.      Really now! A special technique for picking the hay up on      the fork? John showed me how the prongs are first woven in      and out of the first layer of hay so that a matted      foundation is formed for the remainder of the hay to rest      upon. And when hay is pitched onto the wagon, large "wads"      must first be filled along both sides, to hold the central      portion in place. At the end of that first day of haymaking      I came away fully convinced that any prospective      homesteader not instructed in the art of pitching, loading      and unloading hay into the barn loft would be sure to fail      in his attempt to live off the land . . . the sheer work      would be sufficient to figuratively-if not      literally-break his back!    </p>        <p>      A hayfork can well become the symbolic weapon of the green      revolution. As such it must be used properly, as John      Loomis instructed. And make certain that you do not      mistakenly pitch hay with a grass or manure fork.    </p>    <p>      At this stage, however, even such common errors as improper      use and choice of tools cannot substantially impede the      green revolution. For actually, the revolution has come and      gone, and as Ken Kesey puts it . . . "We Won!" An unknown      poet says it this way:    </p>    <p>      <em>Don't look for its soldiers in the city. Most of the      real ones are long since gone to their domes and gardens,      with goats and chickens the</em> <em>day was won. You now      see only plastic imitations who will starve yelling "What's      it all mean?" not knowing that the revolution has come and      gone and was won in a patch of beans.</em>    </p>
