                    <h5 id="byline">      by Mary A. Appelhof    </h5>        <p>      It's pepper-picking time again already . . . which means      that over the next four to eight weeks you may-at      times-find yourself with more crisp, juicy green      peppers on your hands than you know what to do with. Well,      here are a couple of suggestions that should help you      dispose of that bumper crop.    </p>    <p>      In case you didn't know it (I didn't, until recently),      peppers <em>can</em> be frozen. No blanching is needed . .      . all you have to do is [1] slice the upper fourth of each      fruit off, [2] remove the peppers' ribs and seeds, [3]      place the gutted peppers-along with their tops-inside      heavy plastic bags, then [4] expel the air from the bags,      seal 'em up tight, and pop them into the freezer. Six      months later (when supermarket pepper prices have gone      through the roof) you'll have a supply of good-tasting,      inexpensive gardengrown peppers as close as your freezer!    </p>    <p>      OK. That's one way to deal with a surplus of green peppers.      Another is to use them in the following recipe.    </p>    <h3>STOVE-TOP STUFFED PEPPERS</h3>    <p>      What's unique about this stuffed pepper recipe (which came      to me-via a friend-from Yugoslavia) is that all      the cooking is done over a burner. There's no baking      involved . . . which means you can forget about using the      oven-and heating up the entire house-on an      already-scorching-hot summer afternoon.    </p>    <p>      8 green peppers<br />      2/3 cup of uncooked rice<br />      2 tablespoons of cooking oil<br />      1 small onion, diced<br />      garlic to taste (optional)<br />      1 pound of lean ground beef<br />      1 six-ounce can of tomato paste<br />      3 cups of water<br />      salt and pepper    </p>    <p>      Cut the tops off the peppers (set the tops aside), dispose      of the peppers' ribs and seeds, and set the cleaned fruits      upright in a fairly deep saucepan.    </p>    <p>      Next, heat the rice in the cooking oil in a frying pan,      and-when the rice begins to turn brown-add the      onion. (You can-if you want-toss in a bit of garlic,      too.) When both the rice and the onion have browned, add      the ground beef to the pan, break the meat into small      chunks, and cook until brown. Then stuff the peppers about      half full with the rice-onion-beef mixture.    </p>    <p>      All right. Now empty the can of tomato paste into a clean      frying pan and brown the lump of paste. (Swish the tomato      solids around until they've visibly darkened.) Add three      cups of water to the pan, stir to dissolve the browned      paste, and salt and pepper to taste.    </p>    <p>      Finally, pour the tomato sauce <em>into</em> and      <em>around</em> each of the stuffed peppers so that the      bulging fruits are both <em>filled with</em> and      <em>standing in</em> liquid. Put the tops back on the      peppers, cover the saucepan tightly, and cook over low heat      until the rice is done (30 to 45 minutes). That's it!      You've just created a hearty (yet economical) meal for      four!    </p>    <p>      I like to set each pepper in a soup dish, ladle some tomato      sauce over the meat-packed fruit, and top the whole thing      off with a good-sized gob of yogurt or sour cream. If you      have other serving ideas, however, by all means go ahead      and experiment!    </p>    <p>      Once you discover how easy it is to freeze them for future      use-or how delectable they can be when stuffed      according to the above recipe-you just may wish that      bumper crop of green peppers had been even bigger yet!    </p>
