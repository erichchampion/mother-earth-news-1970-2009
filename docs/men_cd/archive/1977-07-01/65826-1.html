        TROMBE WALL UNIT: Air is heated in the space between the double glass panes and the south adobe wall. It then expands, rises, and enters the room through the adobe wall's upper vents. At the same time, cooler air is drawn from the room through the lower vents and into the Trombe wall space, where it?in turn?is heated, rises, etc. The south wall also stores heat which radiates into the room. Other adobe walls and flagstones store additional warmth.
