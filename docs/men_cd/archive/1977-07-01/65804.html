They're the ones conceived      and tested on farms-and in back yards-around      the world. Many are homemade varieties of commercially      available implements . . . others are personal answers to      particular how-to-do-it problems. Whatever, they all have      one thing in common: A large part of the pleasure that      comes from their use derives from the knowledge that      they're self-made.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>And so it is with the following four projects,      selected from a helpful new book put out by the folks at      Rodale Press. We've chosen items particularly well suited      for summertime use, but <em>Build It Better Yourself</em>      offers construction plans for over 200 more . . . a great      number of which could surely benefit you!</strong>    </p>    <h3>A VARMINT FENCE</h3>			<div class="sidebar">    <h3>MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      <strong>HARDWARE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      2 pcs. 18' X 2-1/2" angle iron or<br />      <em>Corner posts:</em> 4 pcs. 9' X 2-1/2"    </p>    <p>      6 pcs. 18' X 2" steel posts or<br />      <em>Side post:</em> 12 pcs. 9' long    </p>    <p>      6 pcs. 10' X 2"steel posts (center posts)<br />    </p>    <p>      4 pcs. 12' X 2-1/4" angle iron or<br />      <em>Corner braces:</em> 8 pcs. 6' X 2-114"    </p>    <p>      8 1 " X 1/4" bolts w/nuts and washers<br />      6 pcs. 12' X 1/2" ID galvanized pipe or    </p>    <p>      <em>Overhead crosspieces:<br /></em> 6 pcs. 10' 6 X1/2"      ID<br />      2 pcs. 10' X 1/2" ID galvanized pipe (end crosspieces)    </p>    <p>      100' 10-gauge galvanized wire<br />      11 rolls 36" X 100' chicken wire<br />      1 pc. 8' X 2" steel post or<br />      <em>Gate post:</em> 1 pc. 7' long    </p>    <p>      <strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Masonry concrete mix    </p>		</div>    <p>      When Lesley and Marion Blanchard moved to their eight-acre      homestead near Sedona, Arizona, they found that, although      their heavily mulched garden produced prodigiously ail      summer, they were able to harvest only a scant amount. The      problem was predators: "Deer, porcupines, rock squirrels,      chipmunks, trade rats, skunks, gray foxes, jackrabbits,      range cattle, and birds," Mrs. Blanchard relates. "You name      it, we have it."    </p>    <p>      The Blanchards live in "open range" country, which means      that it's legally up to the homeowner to fence in his      property against cattle, not up to the cattleman to keep      his roaming herd within bounds. The cattle, porcupines, and      squirrels were particularly destructive.    </p>    <p>      Refusing to surrender, the Blanchards designed a colossal      cage 20 feet wide by 100 feet long to keep out the      marauders. In this space Les planted sixteen dwarf fruit      trees-peaches, pears, apples, apricots, plums,      cherries, and prunes-all of which would mature at      less than the 8-foot height of the cage. The trees were      planted 10 feet apart, with vegetables occupying the rows      between the trees.    </p>    <p>      Within two years, the apricot, peach, and apple trees were      bearing heavily. Thanks to the cage, the fruit now belongs      exclusively to the Blanchards, who no longer need battle      the beasts and the birds for their tree-ripened harvest.    </p>    <h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3>    <p>      [1] Measure the garden perimeter (keeping width 10 feet),      mark the corners with stakes, and stretch a string between      the stakes.    </p>    <p>      [2] Stretch a string lengthwise down the center.    </p>    <p>      [3] Space the outer posts 12 to 15 feet apart.    </p>    <p>      [4] Use the center string to mark the position of the      center posts. They should be in line with the outer posts.    </p>    <p>      [5] At each mark and the corners dig a hole about 12 inches      deep.    </p>    <p>      [6] Between holes dig a narrow trench about 6 inches deep.    </p>    <p>      [7] Cut four pieces of 2-1/2-inch angle iron 9 feet long      for corner posts.    </p>    <p>      [8] Mix cement. Place the 9-foot corner posts in corner      holes and cement in place. Posts can be tied in vertical      position until cement sets.    </p>    <p>      [9] Assemble as many side uprights as needed, using      9-foot-long 2-inch steel posts. Place in holes and fill      with dirt, tamping down well.    </p>    <p>      [10] Set steel fenceposts 10 feet long for center uprights      in holes and fill with dirt, tamping down well. Then brace      with dirt packed to a height of 12 inches around base of      posts.    </p>    <p>      [11] After corners are set, brace each corner with two      2-1/4-inch angle irons set in concrete. Fasten the braces      to the uprights with 1-inch by 1/4-inch bolts.    </p>    <p>      [12] Overhead crosspieces are of 1/2 inch galvanized pipe      cut 10-1/2 feet long and bent to arch over taller center      uprights.    </p>    <p>      [13] End crosspieces are 10-foot sections of 1/2-inch      galvanized pipe. The end crosspieces are not bent.    </p>    <p>      [14] To fasten the crosspieces to the center posts to keep      them from moving, run a length of 10-gauge galvanized wire      down the center of the plot from one end to the other.    </p>    <p>      [15] Starting at the center of the top, unroll 1-inch wire      netting the length of the plot. Work your way down to the      sides wiring each new row together.    </p>    <p>      [16] Before beginning sides, decide where you want the      gate. The best spot is next to an upright. Measure 3 feet      from an upright and dig a 12-inch hole. Sink a 7-foot      length of fencepost into hole and fill with dirt. The      6-inch trench which runs between these posts (under the      gate) should be filled with concrete.    </p>    <p>      [17] Continue covering sides with 1-inch wire netting, but      leave the gate opening uncovered.    </p>    <p>      [18] The gate can be as plain or fancy as you like. Its      purpose is to keep the varmints out.    </p>    <h3>HOT BOX</h3>		    <p>      The hot box is a homemade device with which you can make      casserole and soup-type dishes with a fraction of the      energy you would use in traditional stove-top or      oven-cooking techniques. The box works on this principle:      food is brought to boiling, 212°F and above, and      quickly placed in the insulated box. Its own heat is      retained and finishes the cooking.    </p>    <p>      You should have a reliable kitchen thermometer to use with      the hot box. Experience with the hot box in Rodale Press's      Fitness House kitchen showed that after four or five hours      in the hot box, the temperature of food dropped to between      140° and 160°F, depending on the ingredients and      how full the pot was.    </p>    <p>      According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the danger      with slow-cooking methods is when the warming time to high      temperatures, the 200°-plus range, is long. This allows      bacteria to multiply before they are killed, leaving behind      toxins that can make you just as sick as the live bacteria.    </p>    <p>      The USDA says that between 140° and 165°F, bacteria      <em>growth</em> is prevented, but live bacteria may      survive. The key, therefore, is to bring the food to the      boiling temperature to kill these bacteria first.    </p>    <p>      The simple hot box shown here uses 2-inch-thick Styrofoam      and is lined with aluminum foil. The box itself is made      from 1/4-inch plywood. You'll have to know what size pot      you'll be using, because the box must be built to fit it.    </p>    <h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3>    <h3>MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      <strong>WOOD</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 4' X 4' sht. 1/4" interior<br />      plywood cut to fit your pot<br />    </p>    <p>      1 X 2 stock cut in 4 pcs. to form<br />      sides of lid    </p>    <p>      <strong>HARDWARE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      3/4" brads<br />      Wood glue<br />      White glue<br />      2 1" butt hinges w/screws<br />      1 hasp and staple    </p>    <p>      <strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      2" X 2' X 9' Styrofoam cut to fit<br />      inside of box<br />      Aluminum foil    </p>    <p>      [1] Construct a square box 4 inches larger than the outside      diameter of your pot. It should be 2 inches taller than the      pot with its lid in place. Use 3/4-inch brads and wood glue      to assemble the box.    </p>    <p>      [2] To make the lid, start with a square of plywood with      dimensions 1-1/2 inches greater than the outside dimensions      of the box. Cut 1 X 2 stock to fit the edges, and nail and      glue the pieces in place to make a tight fit.    </p>    <p>      [3] Before you cut your Styrofoam sheet, cover it with      aluminum foil, shiny side up. Use white glue to fasten it.      After it has dried, cut the Styrofoam to fit first the      bottom, then the sides, and-finally-inside the      lid of the box. Again, use glue to hold it in place.    </p>    <p>      [4] Use two 1-inch butt hinges to attach the lid. Install a      light hasp to the front edge of the lid and a staple to the      front of the box.    </p>    <h3>TOOL CLEANER</h3>		    <p>      A good way to keep your garden tools both clean and rust      free is to build an oiling/cleaning pit. All you need do is      dig a hole near the entrance to your toolshed, build a wood      or metal framework inside the hole, and fill it with sand.      Next time you change the oil in your car, tractor, or      mower, just pour the old oil into the sand and mix it up.      You can get old oil from gas stations if you don't have any      around. Try to maintain a sandy texture without too much      oil; if you put your hand in, it should just pick up a      trace of oil, not be dripping wet. With the oil and sand      mixed, just work your tools in the mix for a few seconds,      and they should be clean, oiled, and ready to be put away.    </p>    <p>      Cut four 12-inch-long pieces of 1 X 12. Using a simple butt      joint and 8d nails, fasten the pieces together into a      square frame. Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the      frame so that it will project about 2 inches above the      ground. Fill the frame with builder's sand, then backfill      with soil around the outside of the frame. Pour that old      oil in with the sand and work it with a shovel.    </p>    <h3>MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      <strong>WOOD</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 pc.1 X 12 X 6' or<br />      Walls: 4 pcs. 1 X 12 X 12"<br />      Lid: 1 pc. 1 X 12 X 11-1/4" (or<br />      1 11-1/4" sq. sht. 314" ext. plywood)<br />      1 pc. 1 X 1 X 2' or<br />      Cleats: 2 pcs. 1 X 1 X 10-1/2"    </p>    <p>      <strong>HARDWARE</strong>    </p>    <p>      8d nails<br />      1-1/4" brads<br />      1 door pull<br />      Wood preservative    </p>    <p>      If you're a bit fussy, you could fashion a lid for the tool      cleaning pit. Cut an 11-1/4-inch-square piece of 3/4-inch      exterior plywood. To one side fasten a common door pull      handle. To the other fasten two 10 1/2-inch cleats with      brads to help keep the lid in place.    </p>    <p>      For the sake of longevity, it would be good to use the      well-known rot-resistant materials or wood treated with a      wood preservative.    </p>   <h3> SOIL SIFTER</h3>	 	    <p>      A simple sifter for compost or potting soil can be made by      nailing a piece of 1/4-inch hardware cloth to the bottom of      a 12-inch by 18-inch frame.    </p>    <h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3>    <h3>MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      <strong>WOOD</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      1 pc. 1 X 4 X 4' or<br />      Sides: 2 pcs. 1 X 4 X 18"<br />    </p>    <p>      1 pc. 1 X 6 X 2'or<br />      Ends: 2 X 6 X 10-112"<br />      <br />      <strong>HARDWARE</strong><br />      <br />      6d nails    </p>    <p>      1 pc. 12" X 18" hardware cloth,<br />      1/4" mesh<br />      3/4" staples    </p>    <p>      [1] Cut two 18-inch lengths of 1 X 4 and two 10-1/2-inch      lengths of 1 X 6.    </p>    <p>      [2] Taper the ends and cut handholds into them. From a      corner at each end of the boards, measure and mark 2 inches      along the butt end and 3-1/4 inches along the edge. Draw a      line connecting the two points and cut along the line. Then      mark a 1-inch by 3-1/2-inch rectangle in the upper middle      of each end board, as shown. Cut out the rectangle with a      keyhole or coping saw.    </p>    <p>      [3] Butt the sides against the ends and nail the sifter      frame together, using 6d nails.<br />    </p>    <p>      [4] Staple a 12-inch by 18-inch piece of 1/4-inch hardware      cloth to the bottom.    </p>
