            		 <p>      Homegrown "scratch" chickens-as any farm boy or girl      raised on them knows-have a far better taste than the      additive-packed, cage-reared, "factory" birds sold in the      supermarkets. And that's one reason so many of us are      starting to raise your own backyard flock of biddies for      eggs and meat again. It's also why so many of us-for      the first time in our lives-are (gulp) facing the      unfamiliar and somewhat scary task of dressing out some of      those backyard birds.    </p>    <p>      "Never fear," says Paula Delfeld, a chicken picker of some      experience. "The job is not at all as difficult as you've      probably imagined. Here's how I handle the chore on our      farm up here in Brownsville, Wisconsin."    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by Paula Delfeld    </h5>    <p>      The price of freedom is always responsibility. And if      you've taken up the raising of your own chickens to free      yourself from weak, watery agribiz eggs and additive-laden,      preservative-packed, and water-injected supermarket meat      ... sooner or later you're going to have to assume the      responsibility of picking, plucking, and preparing your own      poultry.    </p>         <p>      When that day comes <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: Experienced      homestead poultry raisers know that smaller birds, such as      Leghorns, make delectable fried chicken when they're no      bigger than a pound and three quarters to two pounds in      size and that larger breeds, such as White Rocks, can be      eaten as fryers as soon as they reach a weight of three      pounds. They can also be eaten fried when they're larger      too, of course . . . but there's something so      mouthwateringly special about that first meal of homegrown      fried chicken every summer that the old hands among us      always seem to rush it to the table a little faster, maybe,      than we should),</em> your first step will be to examine      your flock and pick out the first bird you want to butcher.    </p>    <p>      <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: Your chickens will stay a lot calmer      and you'll work a lot less while catching the birds if      you'll get yourself a long (eight to ten feet) length of      3/16" or 1/4" metal rod from the hardware store or a      junkyard and bend one end into a handle and the other into      a crook just</em> b <em>ig enough to slip over a chicken's      leg but not big enough to slip over its foot. It's then a      simple matter to slowly move</em><em>around through a pen      or house full of the poultry and "hook" the birds one at a      time at your leisure.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Carefully inspect the chickens you catch. Pinfeathers are      more difficult to remove than larger ones so, if you're      rushing the season a little, make sure the young birds you      butcher are well feathered out . . . otherwise, they may be      hard to pick. You should also feel around the two bones      that protrude just below the vent of mature hens. If you      can fit three fingers between these bones, the chicken is      probably laying which means (if you want the eggs) that you      should pass that particular lady by in favor of another hen      on which the bones are closer together.    </p>    <p>      As you select each bird-or group of birds-for      the table, you can either cage them for later slaughter or      kill them then and there. There are several ways to do      this, but I prefer the simple and straightforward "axe and      chopping block" method. The block can be any chunk of      firewood, as long as it's solid and squared off on both      ends so that it won't move around or tip over and cause you      to hurt yourself or maim a chicken as you wield your axe or      hatchet.    </p>    <p>      Hold the tips of each bird's wings (to give you more      control) right along with its feet in one hand as you      position the chicken's head (with its neck well stretched      out) on the block. One quick, firm, well-placed blow (Fig.      1) with a sharp axe or hatchet, then, is all you should      need to sever the bird's head.    </p>    <p>      Continue to hold the chicken with its neck down so that      it'll bleed well. The blood can be allowed to fall around      the bases of your fruit trees, if you have any (Fig. 2),      where it will both serve as a good fertilizer and      discourage rabbits from kill ing the trees by nibbling away      their bark. If you need to, hold both the bird's wings and      feet during this bleeding process to keep it from flopping      around and spraying blood on you.    </p>    <p>      As soon as the chicken is bled-but before it has a      chance to stiffen-you should carry it directly to a      waiting pile of old newspapers, a sharp paring knife, a      bucket of boiling water, and a pan of cold water . . . for      scalding, picking, and washing.    </p>    <p>      Although authorities on the subject recommend that young      birds be scalded for only a few seconds in 150° to      160°F water and that older birds be dipped slightly      longer in water heated to 180° or 190°F, experience      will soon teach you that temperature and dipping times are      not as critical as these experts would have you believe.      Just remember that if your water is too cold and/or you do      not immerse a chicken in it long enough ... the bird will      be hard to pick. And if the water is too hot and/or you      leave your poultry in it too long . . . the feathers will      practically fall out by themselves, but the skin of each      plucked bird will be discolored and may even break in      several places.    </p>    <p>      Relax! No matter how poorly you scald and pick your first      few chickens, they should still be edible. Practice makes      perfect. Keep trying. You'll soon get the hang of it. I      don't even use a thermometer. I just remove my boiling      water from the fire, dip a chicken in quickly if it's young      and a little more slowly if it's older, re-dip the really      tough birds as necessary, and then place each scalded bird      on the pile of newspapers and let it steam for a few      minutes. Then, as soon as the wing feathers will pull out      easily, I know it's time to go to work.    </p>    <p>      Grasp the body of a scalded and steamed bird in one hand      and one of its legs at the top of the thigh in the other.      Then (Fig. 3) pull the second hand down toward the leg's      foot. Most of the feathers will slip right off the leg in      one operation. Repeat this process on the other leg, both      wings, and the neck. If the chicken was scalded properly      and didn't have too many pinfeathers, most of the body      feathers can then be pulled out by the handful. In the      beginning, of course, you'll probably select chickens that      are "all" pinfeathers, scald them poorly, and pick so      slowly that the birds' feathers tighten up on you again      before you have them cleaned. Don't despair! Work faster      and you'll soon have the knack of stripping the feathers      from a chicken so quickly and easily that others will think      the fowl picked itself. In the meantime, though, reconcile      yourself to slowly and laboriously plucking seemingly      endless pinfeathers from your first few birds . . . one . .      . . by . . . . . tedious . . . . . . one.    </p>    <p>      OK. Feathers and pinfeathers all out? You're ready to singe      away the fine hairs that are still on the chicken. This can      be done over an open gas flame (Fig. 4) or, if you have a      wood-burning cookstove, you can remove one of the range's      lids, shove a wadded section of newspaper down the "eye",      light the paper, and singe the chicken over the blaze. Or      just twist some newspaper together, strike a match, and      singe your birds outside if the wind isn't blowing too      hard.    </p>    <p>      Remove the picked and singed chicken's feet by bending each      foot back (Fig. 5) and cutting through the joint. Some      people like to skin the feet and cook them for soup or to      add flavor to broth. Others just throw the unskinned feet      to the dogs.    </p>    <p>      If your bird is to be cooked whole, you can now advance      directly to Fig. 7 and its accompanying copy. If the      chicken is to be cut up, however, you may find it easier at      this point to cut off the legs (Fig. 6). Pull each one away      from the body and cut between the body and the      leg-right down to the joint-with a sharp knife.      As you then bend the drumstick and thigh further out from      the body the joint should separate, and you should be able      to cut the leg completely away. Wings may be removed in the      same manner, either now or after the bird has been gutted.      Rinse off each severed piece of meat and drop it into your      pan of cold water.    </p>    <p>      To remove the chicken's entrails, slit the skin from the      end of the breastbone (Fig. 7) all the way to the vent. You      can insert your fingers into the opening behind the knife      blade as you make this cut if you like, to help prevent the      accidental puncturing of the bird's intestines. To simplify      the removal of the entrails, you may also want to make a      second incision <em>across</em> the chicken's belly, just      below the breastbone (this cut can be made right down to      the backbone) . . . and you .should also make sure that      your first cut is continued <em>around</em> the vent.    </p>    <p>      Now (Fig. 8) insert a hand into the opening you've just      made and work your fingers around the intestines to loosen      them from the cavity. This is also the time to locate the      tube leading up to the neck and cut if off as close as      possible to its upper end. (Yes, this is the messiest part      of the whole job, but it'll soon be over.)    </p>    <p>      Success! As soon as the "neck tube" is cut, all the bird's      innards will slide right out of the body cavity. Locate the      greenish gall sac in the liver and cut around it without      spilling its bitter contents on any of the meat you want to      save. Then (Fig. 9) cut off the gizzard, liver, and heart.      Cut into the gizzard until you reach its lining and remove      the organ's contents with the lining. (This will be a      little difficult to do and, usually, some of its contents      will get on the gizzard. Don't worry. It'll rinse off      easily.) Put the clean gizzard, liver, and heart in your      pan of cold water.    </p>    <p>      Now (Fig. 10) make an incision in the neck just above the      breastbone and locate the two tubes leading to the crop      (sometimes called the craw) and the lungs. Work your      fingers around the craw and carefully remove the crop (Fig.      11) without rupturing it. The lungs can be taken out as the      body of the bird is cut up. Or, if the body will be left      whole, you can reach into the lower opening that you've      made in the body and run your fingers under the lungs to      remove them.    </p>    <p>      Finally (Fig. 12), remove the oil sac above the tail by      cutting under and around it. Wash all the meat you've      saved. If the chicken is to be baked or roasted, you can      put it into the oven whole. If it's to be fried or prepared      in some other way that calls for individual pieces, cut up      what's left . . . and you're finished.    </p>    <p>      The disagreeable part of preparing a chicken is soon      forgotten when the bird is brought to the table in the form      of a delicious dish. Here's one of my favorites:    </p>    <p>      Dip individual pieces of chicken in milk, then in a mixture      of flour, salt, and pepper. Brown the chunks of meat in oil      or other shortening, and then put them in a deep baking      dish. Add one-half cup of water and bake at 350°F. When      tender, mix one can of mushroom soup with 3/4 cup of water      and pour over the chicken. Bake 15 to 20 minutes longer and      serve.    </p>
