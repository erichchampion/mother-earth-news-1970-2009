                    <h5 id="byline">      by Fredd√§ Burton    </h5>    <p>      If you've been looking for something <em>really</em>      different to spice up your daily menu-a unique fruit,      say, with an indescribably exotic flavor that conjures up      visions of sunny tropical isles-chances are you won't      have to look much further than your own back yard.    </p>    <p>      Because the mighty May apple bears just such a treat. And      if you live anywhere in the eastern half of the United      States between Quebec and Florida, you shouldn't have any      trouble finding enough of the fruit to make loads of      succulent preserves and a gallon or two of the most      delicious summer punch this side of the Garden of Eden!    </p>        <p>      Fortunately for all of us, the May apple (known among      scientific circles as <em>Podophyllum peltatum</em> ) is      one of the simplest to identify of all forest forageables.      The species is sometimes called "umbrella plant" or "duck's      foot" . . . and it's easy to see why. The mature plant,      which bears one or two large (often a foot across) flat      leaves centrally attached to either a single or      "Y"-branched stem, by gosh, looks like a miniature      umbrella. And because its expansive foliage is deeply      cleft, some naturalists (the more imaginative ones, anyway)      think it resembles-yep, you guessed it-a duck's      foot. Take a look at the accompanying photos and draw your      own conclusions.    </p>    <p>      The best places to look for May apple plants are moist,      open woods and the edges of boggy meadows. Keep your eyes      open for a cluster of greenery, rather than lone specimens.      <em>Podophyllum peltatum</em> grows from a single      underground rhizoid stem which-in very early      spring-sends up dozens of finger-shaped shoots      sporting young leaves tightly furled around a central      stalk. Within a matter of just a few weeks, huge rambling      colonies of full-blown specimens twelve to eighteen inches      tall blanket entire patches of ground, completely shading      (and in effect mulching) the earth from which they've      sprung.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly enough, only the dual-leaved "Y"-branched      members of the community bear flowers and fruit. In      midspring, a single large (two inches in diameter) white      blossom with six to nine petals appears at the fork of each      "Y"-plant's stem, nodding inconspicuously beneath its own      personal "umbrella". The bloom is a true forest beauty . .      . although the odor it exudes is downright nasty.    </p>    <p>      Then, in June or early July (depending on the climate where      you live), the attractive blossom gives way to a smooth,      fleshy "berry" the size and shape of a small lemon. The      little globe is at first green, but-within a matter      of weeks-ripens to a distinct yellow. Strangely      enough, the plant's foliage dies off at about the same time      . . . so that, come apple-hunting season (mid-July or      August) often only the dry, bare stems and the fruit      remain. (Which, incidentally, is why it's a good idea to      "scout out" and actually map May apple patches in the early      spring, when the distinctive green leaves make positive      identification easy. Then you can simply return in      midsummer and harvest the goodies with no fear of      getting-shudder-The Wrong Thing by mistake.)    </p>    <p>      Once you do strike off into the woods with empty collecting      bags in hand-and visions of sweet punch and preserves      in your head-remember that the luscious, fragrant,      ambrosial May apple fruit ain't luscious, fragrant, or      ambrosial until it is dead ripe. The skin should be clear      yellow (with no green showing) : . . the pulp should be      translucent and have a jellylike texture . . . and the      berry itself should be just about ready to fall to the      ground. Some folks (of the "persimmon" school of foraging),      in fact, won't collect the fruit at all unless it has      dropped to earth as evidence that it's ready to be eaten.    </p>    <p>      What does a fully mature May apple fruit taste like? Well,      to be honest, I can't really give you an adequate      description. All I can say is that the sweet, mildly acid      flavor has been likened to that of papayas, and      strawberries, and cantaloupes . . . but none of those      comparisons really does the job. You'll just have to find      out for yourself.    </p>    <p>      Be careful, though: When it comes to eating these little      rascals, overindulgence is far too easy . . . and the      consequences are all too similar to the gastrointestinal      furor that comes from consuming too many green apples.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, I can tell you for sure that the fruit of the      May apple tastes <em>good</em> (to say the least). Chances      are, once you've sampled one or two of the elusively      flavored berries in the field, you'll want to gather up as      many as you can to take home. And in that case, I suspect      you might want to try my two favorite May apple recipes      (enjoy, enjoy!):    </p>    <h3>MIGHTY MAY APPLE PUNCH</h3>    <p>      Using a juicer or food mill, crush (and strain the seeds      from) enough raw fruit to make one ounce of juice. Combine      the liquid with seven ounces of fresh lemonade, stir, and      pour into glasses filled with ice.    </p>   <h3>SUNNY MORNING MAY APPLE PRESERVES</h3>    <p>      Simmertwo quarts of May apples (with stems and blossom ends      removed) in one cup of water until the fruit is soft. Then      pour the mass directly into a colander and press the pulp      through into a container, leaving the skins and seeds      behind. Add one box of Sure-Jell for every four cups of      cooked fruit, and bring the mixture to a boil. Finally, add      fiive cups of sugar, bring to a hard boil, and-after      one minute-pour the finished preserves into sterile      jars and seal with paraffin or canning lids.    </p>    <p>      (If you choose to use low-methoxyl pectin for this recipe      instead of Sure-Jell, you can substitute approximately      2-1/2 to 3 cups of honey for the sugar . . . or the spread      simply can be jelled without additional sweetener.      Remember, though, that preserves made in this way must be      "put up" in sterile jars with conventional canning lids. A      simple paraffin seal is not adequate to prevent bacterial      growth in low-sugar foods.)    </p>    <h3>a short medicinal history of the may apple</h3>    <p>      Down through the years the May apple <em>(</em>      <em>Podophyllum peltatum</em> ) has had many common names,      including wild jalap, hog apple, ground lemon, Indian      apple, raccoon berry, and American mandrake. The plant      sometimes received that last name not because it is in any      way directly related to the European mandrake <em>(</em>      <em>Podophyllum peltatum</em> is a member of the barberry      family while <em>Mandragora officinarum,</em> the European      mandrake, belongs-like the potato, the tomato, and      belladonna-to the nightshade family) . . . but      because podophyllin-a bitter, resinous extract taken      from the roots, leaves, and stems of the May      apple-does have medicinal powers that somewhat      resemble those of the European mandrake.    </p>    <p>      The medicinal dosage of podophyllin is very small and      overdoses can kill . . . so do not eat the roots or foliage      of the May apple (just as you should never eat the sprouts      of the potato).    </p>    <p>      The Penobscot Indians used the crushed roots of the May      apple as a poultice for the removal of warts and the      Menominee tribe considered the stems and foliage of the      plant to be a good pesticide. They boiled those parts of      the May apple In water and then applied the cooled liquid      to their potato patches to repel the insects that attacked      them.-FB.    </p>
