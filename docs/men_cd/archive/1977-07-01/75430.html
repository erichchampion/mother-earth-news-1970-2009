                <p>      If you now operate-or have ever operated-a      successful home business that was inspired by an article      you read in MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or less) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"-you      started your venture. If your story can be fitted into an      upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES, you'll      receive (1) the warm satisfaction of knowing that you      helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy and (2) a      free two-year new or renewal subscription to THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS.    </p>        <p>      As soon as I saw Ruth Ross's recipes in MOTHER NO. 42 ("You      Can Bake Steamed Breads . . . Right on Your Stove Top!"), I      knew I was onto a fail-safe cash project. And what made it      so great was that I'd recently bought some large enameled      pots . . . perfect for stovetop steaming!    </p>    <p>      I knew instinctively that two of the breads in particular      would be real moneymakers, because-just reading their      names-I couldn't wait to taste them!    </p>    <p>      Within minutes, I was buying a supply of dates, raisins,      and walnuts, and that evening three of us enjoyed Ruth's      Boston Brown Bread and Steamed Date and Honey Bread ...      with cream cheese, homemade fig preserves, and assorted      other toppings (they were delicious even plain).    </p>    <p>      As we ate, I thought about ways to sell this good stuff,      and that same night I made up a batch of both breads and      even tried my own variation: Orange Date Nut Bread. While      the goodies steamed, I hand-printed half a dozen posters,      and next morning-armed with my ads and with dishes of      the breads cut into small, tantalizing samples-made      the rounds of my neighborhood.    </p>    <p>      By noon, I'd tacked up my posters at the Laundromat, the      local hospital, two small grocery stores, a drugstore, and      a cafe. At the hospital, I passed around samples and took      orders on the spot. Everywhere else, I just left the      bite-sized persuaders ... then raced home to catch the      telephone orders.    </p>    <p>      It was that simple. And, though I've now taken down my      posters, the orders are still coming in as fast as 1 can      handle them. I sell my loaves for $1.00, $2.00, or $3.00 .      . . according to whether they're made in 1-, 1-1/2-, or      2-pound coffee cans, I clear about $350 for 40 hours of      work (my profit on a $1.00 loaf is between 65 cents and      70 cents and it runs proportionally more for the larger      loaves). And, with my large kettle and rack arrangement, I      can steam 14 to 16 small loaves at a time.    </p>    <p>      Folks, modesty fails me: Those breads are absolutely      lipsmacking good! And a less painful way to make good money      at home I have yet to come across.    </p>    <p>      John Minton<br />      Fairhope, Ala.    </p>    <p>      My man and I have always loved the land and wanted to live      close to it, but we haven't yet saved enough money to buy      our own homestead.    </p>    <p>      That's why it was an important moment for us last year,      while traveling in the Pacific Northwest, when we took our      first peek at THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted). Inspired by Dale      and Sandy Deraps' article in MOTHER NO. 39, "Caretake a      Farm (and Live Rent Free)", and by a friend who'd tried      caretaking in Canada, we soon thought of little else but      finding a place of our own to tenant.    </p>    <p>      What's more, Jorge felt that his talent for leatherwork      could take us closer to our dream, but we knew he'd need a      roomy and semi-permanent workshop ... still another reason      to seek a position as custodians.    </p>    <p>      Like the Deraps, we placed a newspaper ad in an area we      found appealing (in our case, the region surrounding      Missoula, Montana). But-before the ad had stopped      running-we realized that our chosen locale just      didn't seem right for us.    </p>    <p>      Suddenly I said, "Why don't we go to an area that we know,      and feel comfortable in ... a place where we have good      references?"    </p>    <p>      "For instance?" Jorge asked.    </p>    <p>      "Why, St. Louis," I replied. "It's my hometown,      and-after all-it's the very place where the      Deraps had such good luck!"    </p>    <p>      So off we set, on a thousand-mile journey back to Missouri.    </p>    <p>      And now, sure enough, here we are about 30 miles west of      St. Louis ... with a nice-sized farmhouse, some horses and      a stable to care for, and a barn converted to a quaint,      country tack and leather shop. We already have our garden      going and our chickens clucking!    </p>    <p>      At last we have a means to our end, thanks to Dale and      Sandy and MOTHER. Our "work" (it's hard to see it as that)      as country caretakers suits us just perfectly . . . and it      looks like it's going to make our dream come true.    </p>    <p>      Lorrie Fassi<br />      Glencoe, Mo.    </p>    <p>      When my husband and I were expecting our first child, I      started looking for ways to augment our income without too      much initial cash outlay. And-since a baby needs a      lot of attention-I knew I should choose an occupation      that wouldn't take up a lot of time. When I came across the      article "Recycled Refunds" in MOTHER NO. 6, I realized that      refunding could be just what I was looking for.    </p>    <p>      So I set out to collect the basic necessities: mail-in      coupons (readily available from grocery stores and women's      magazines), product labels (from my own shelves and those      of relatives and friends, and from the city dump),      envelopes (from the discount store), stamps, and a good      refund bulletin (a little newsletter that lists current      refunds, tips, and ads offering coupon sources. The best      I've found is JayBee's, P.O. Box 39, Valley Park, Mo.      63088, which usually lists over 200 new offers each      month-many of which you can send for without benefit      of a form-for 50 cents per month or $5.00 per year.      Or you can swap a book of trading stamps for a six-month      subscription. But you might try several different      newsletters until you find the one that most benefits you.)    </p>    <p>      My starting-out costs were: 50d for 100 envelopes, $10 for      100 stamps, and a book of trading stamps (worth $2.50) for      a six-month JayBee's subscription. I saved, salvaged, and      begged labels and box tops as best I could, so that my      total investment was only $13. Most refunds are for amounts      from 25d to $2.00, and my receipts from those first 100      envelopes came to $105.60. Minus the $13, my net income was      $92.60.    </p>    <p>      In the beginning, I spent a lot of hours getting      organized-collecting forms, sorting labels,      etc.-but I now average about an hour a day. . .      addressing envelopes and enclosing the appropriate coupons      and labels. I try to send out 20 to 25 offer responses each      week, and my returns come back in four to six weeks. The      postage increase hasn't hurt my profits, since most      companies have increased their repayment amounts to      compensate.    </p>    <p>      My net tax-free income for the first year was $595 in cash      and merchandise . . . not bad for an hour's work per day!    </p>    <p>      Refunds are Big Business's way of enticing us consumers to      buy. I don't know how many millions are made in increased      sales, but I do know that my refunding enterprise is a      reliable help to us in making ends meet.    </p>    <p>      Sara Sanders<br />      Troy, Ohio    </p>
