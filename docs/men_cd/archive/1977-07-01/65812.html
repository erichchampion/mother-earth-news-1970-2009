                     <h5 id="byline">by JOHN R. HUNT</h5>        <p>      The trompe. Its use dates back to the beginning of the Iron      Age, and yet-like many good ideas involving the      manufacture of power-the trompe concept has been all      but forgotten in the recent stampede to mine, refine, and      consume readily exploitable supplies of fossil fuels.    </p>    <p>      For the homesteader or farmer with a small waterfall or a      good-sized stream on his property, the trompe is a natural.      It offers a virtually inexhaustible supply of free      compressed air . . . <em>cool, dry</em> air that can be      used to operate a forge, drive machinery, or aircondition a      house or barn in hot weather.    </p>    <p>      What exactly is a trompe? Very simply, a <em>trompe</em>      (sometimes spelled <em>trombe</em> ) is a device that uses      the energy of falling water to pressurize air. This      pressurization is achieved by means of a standpipe or shaft      down which a column of water is allowed to fall. As it      drops, the water draws air through small inclined orifices      (see the accompanying diagram) and carries it to a      submerged plenum or reservoir, where the air separates from      the water and is held under pressure. (The      water-meanwhile-continues to flow to an exit      pipe, the end of which is high enough to balance the      pressure in the reservoir.) The pressurized air can then be      drawn off through a tuyere-or escape nozzle-to      be used as needed.    </p>    <p>      Many large-scale trompes-or hydraulic air compression      plants-were built at the turn of the century to      supply mines with fresh air. One of the biggest of      these-and probably the last one still in use-is      the Ragged Chutes plant on the Montreal River near the town      of Cobalt, in northern Ontario's silver mining country.    </p>    <p>      At Ragged Chutes, water falls down a shaft 351 feet deep      and nine feet across to generate the compressed air that      supplies the area's mines. The Ontario Hydro Electric      Commission engineers who operate the plant are said to view      the giant trompe with some disdain, since-except for      a simple water-flow control-it has no moving parts,      relies on no computers, makes no noise, and doesn't pollute      the environment. So far, however, the mining companies have      successfully resisted attempts to have the plant replaced      with something more "modern".    </p>    <p>      One remarkable feature of trompes (the Ragged Chutes plant      included) is that the air that comes <em>out</em> of the      system is actually cooler and drier than the air that goes      <em>in</em> . The air comes out cooler because the cold      water flowing through the trompe absorbs the heat that's      usually generated by the compression of air. It comes out      <em>drier</em> because the atmospheric moisture held in the      air bubbles that flow through the system condenses-so      to speak-on the bubbles' walls (since those walls      are, after all, colder than the air they're surrounding).      The result: Compressed air that's [1] the same temperature      as the cool water it just left and [2] drier than it was      when it entered the trompe. Free air conditioning!    </p>    <p>      The Ragged Chutes plant employs a battery of 72      14-inch-diameter pipes to mix the air and water as they      fall into the inflow shaft, but the builder of a      small-scale trompe should be able to achieve the same      result with only one or two such tubes. Here are a couple      of things to remember if you decide to jury-rig your own      hydraulic air compressor:    </p>    <p>      [1] If you want to be able to switch the air off but leave      water running through the device, build a "blowoff" pipe      (see diagram), the lower end of which is located slightly      below the normal water level in the reservoir. This way,      when you block the airflow through the discharge line, the      air pressure in the reservoir will increase to the point      where the water level drops and surplus air can escape      through the blowoff pipe. (At Ragged Chutes, the blowoff      sends a mixture of water and air 100 feet into the sky.)    </p>    <p>      [2] When you first start up your trompe, don't let any air      escape through the discharge line until the pressure has      had a chance to build. Otherwise you'll end up with a      plenum full of water and no compressed air.    </p>    <p>      The trompe: a mighty old idea . . . and a mighty good one,      too.    </p>
