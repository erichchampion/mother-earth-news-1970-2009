                    <p>      You really can earn over $100 a day recycling old tires in      almost any populated section of North America," says      Washington State's Bob Stevenson. "I've been doing it for      years in a number of different cities as far east as      Lansing, Michigan and as far north as Saskatoon,      Saskatchewan. And, contrary to what you probably believe,      you <em>don't</em> need a truck to get into this business,      the work is <em>not</em> heavy, and there are plenty of old      tires lying around just waiting for you to pick them up!"    </p>    <p>      I've gotten so many good, practical ideas from MOTHER that      I now feel it only fair to tell other readers about my own      part-time moneymaker. I pick up old tires for free . . .      and then sell almost all that I collect for anywhere from      $1.00 to $40 each! What's more, I've been doing this since      I was in high school, I've worked this little side business      in a number of cities around the U.S. and Canada as I've      gone to college and been transferred by the Air Force, and      I believe that nearly anyone can do as well as or better      than I've done with this grassroots enterprise. It's an      especially good venture for a back-to-the-land husband and      wife team.    </p>    <h3>THE BUSINESS: WHAT IT IS</h3>    <p>      Quite simply, my part-time enterprise consists of nothing      but collecting castoff, used tires from gas stations and      tire dealers and then selling them to retreading shops.      That may sound too simple to you . . . but the idea works      for me, it works for hundreds of other people all over the      U.S. and Canada, and I don't think you'll find it too      difficult to make it work for you.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO GET STARTED</h3>    <p>      Pull out the telephone book (or books) for your town,      nearest city, and/or other metropolitan centers in your      area and make a list of the names and addresses printed      under "Tire Retreading" in the Yellow Pages. Then call      around to find out which recapping shop within easy driving      distance will pay you the most for the tires you collect. I      average $1.00 to $1.50 for every good passenger tire casing      I sell and up to $40 (that's <em>forty</em> dollars!) or      more for large truck tire casings.    </p>    <p>      While you're on the phone, ask each shop you talk to if it      has any restrictions on the type or number of tires you      bring in. Some retreaders, for instance, won't take      steelbelted radials . . . others simply aren't set up to      handle some sizes of casings ... and still other recappers      have a definitely limited capacity. (Still, there always      seems to be at least one shop in every area that will buy      all the tires you can collect. I recently asked a spokesman      for one of these companies if his firm would be interested      in 1,000 tires and he said, "Bring 'em right in!")    </p>    <h3>THE BEST SEASON IS COMING      UP!</h3>    <p>      Late summer and early fall is the busiest time of the year      for retreaders. This is the season when they begin working      on their winter "snow-caps" and      during-say-August, September, and October, many      shops stockpile used casings for this coming business. You      may even find that some recappers will pay you a little      more per tire during this period.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO COLLECT CASINGS</h3>    <p>      This is the part that's easier than it sounds. There's      hardly a gas station in the country, which sells tires,      that doesn't have at least 10 and sometimes 50 or more old      casings stacked up out back somewhere with the trash.      Frequently, the owners and managers of service stations      have to pay a premium to have these discarded rubber      carcasses hauled away.    </p>    <p>      And that's where you come in. Just go around to the      stations, garages, and tire dealers in your area and tell      them you'll tote their old tires away for free. And that      should be all you have to do to line up as many of the      casings as you want to handle!    </p>    <p>      To date-and I've been doing this for years-I      haven't had a single gas station owner or tire dealer      refuse to let me have his old carcasses. In fact, the      closest I've ever come to being turned down was once when I      told a station manager what I was going to do with the      casings (I always tell the truth when asked), and he said      he just believed he'd haul the old tires to the retreader      himself. But then, as I was leaving, he called me back and      said, "On second thought, I can't be bothered. Take 'em on      in."    </p>    <p>      So remember: You're performing a valuable service when you      haul away for free the discards that service stations and      tire dealers would otherwise have to spend good money to      dispose of. Never, <em>never</em> pay for the tires you      collect. There's no need to. Tens of thousands of casings      are cluttering up thousands of garages all over your state      right now. The people who have these carcasses are anxious      to get rid of them. In the few cases when I've been asked      if I intended to buy the discards I wanted to haul away,      I've always said "no" ... and I've ended up being given the      old tires anyway.    </p>		<h3>WHAT TO LOOK FOR</h3>    <p>      As a matter of fact, if      anyone nixes your picking up a particular assortment of      runout tires from a service station ... it'll probably be      you. The government has recently tightened its safety      standards for recaps and, if you're smart, you won't want      to waste your time collecting and hauling casings that      retread shops can't use. Basically, there are four things      you should keep an eye peeled for as you inspect a garage's      discards:    </p>    <p>      [1] A tire's bead (the part that mounts directly on a      wheel's rim) must have no cuts, tears, or excessive      wear.<br />      [2] There can be no holes in the casing ... not even a      small puncture that has been repaired with patches or      rubber plugs.<br />      [3] There must be no tire cords (the string-like threads or      bands embedded in the rubber) showing.<br />      [4] Small surface cracks are usually OK, but there can be      no deep cracks in a carcass's sidewalls.    </p>    <p>      These may sound like fairly high standards for a castoff      tire, but you'll probably find that most of the discards      you inspect will measure up (after all, they were providing      satisfactory service right up until the time they were      replaced). If you're in any way unsure of your ability to      spot a good, retreadable casing . . . just drop by the      recapping shop you'll be working with and have one of the      inspectors there give you a quick lesson in what to look      for.    </p>    <h3>TOTE THOSE TIRES!</h3>    <p>      Obviously, the more tires you haul to your retreader at      once, the less trips you'll have to make. This cuts down on      gas, oil, and other overhead costs . .. drastically shaves      the amount of time it takes to move casings from your      sources to the recapper . . . and, in general, increases      the profitability of your operation.    </p>    <p>      There's no need, though, to plunge into this business by      rushing out and buying the biggest truck with the biggest      built-up bed you can find. You can quite adequately test      the potential of a tire salvaging enterprise with just      about any vehicle that will carry five or more old      carcasses.    </p>    <p>      When I started all I had was a station wagon and, by tying      a few casings on its roof rack, I could load it      with-at most-15 or 20 discards.      Later-after we'd sold the wagon-we rented a      trailer for about $6.00 a day, pulled it around with a      Volkswagen (!), and just collected tires on Saturdays. And      still later, we bought an old 1954 half-ton truck for $250,      built an extended rack on its bed, and found the homebrewed      rig to be just right for our part-time operation. We've      never deemed it necessary to go to the built-up two-ton and      even bigger trucks that some full-time casing recyclers      use.    </p>    <h3>COLLECT YOUR MONEY</h3>    <p>      Now all you have to do is take your tires to the retreader      and collect your money. If the shop isn't too busy and you      don't have too many of the casings, an inspector will often      check over the carcasses while you wait. Frequently,      though, you'll be issued a receipt and told to drop by or      phone later to find out how many of the tires were      accepted.    </p>    <p>      Don't be too discouraged with the results of the first few      loads you haul in. In spite of how well you think you've      inspected the casings, it's a good bet that a fourth to a      third of them will be rejected. Relax. As you gain      experience, you'll be able to reduce your percentage of dis      cards until virtually every carcass you deliver will be a      "good one".    </p>    <p>      Some capping shops will pay you directly in cash, others      will issue an immediate check, and still others (usually      the ones that are a branch of a bigger operation) will mail      your check to you (sometimes from another office).    </p>    <p>      An important tip: Keep track of your expenses. Although      your income is taxable, you can deduct all the gas, oil,      etc., bills that you run up while scouting out, collecting,      and hauling the tires you handle. Keep a record of the      miles you drive as well as any receipts that might be      helpful at tax time.    </p>    <h3>ADDITIONAL TIPS AND HINTS</h3>    <p>      You'll find you can pack more tires into your truck or      trailer if you "herringbone" stack them as shown in one of      the illustrations that accompany this article.    </p>    <p>      Tell your retread shop you don't want any of the casings      back that aren't accepted. This'll save you the expense of      hauling them to the dump.    </p>    <p>      You can always collect a few of the ca r casses on your way      home from work, while running an errand to the store, etc.      You don't have to make a special trip to get them.    </p>    <p>      If you live far out in the country or a long way from your      recapping shop, it may well be worth your while to go into      town once a week or so and spend the whole day on your tire      recycling operation.    </p>    <p>      Once you really get into the swing of this business, you      can even set up your own regular collection route. Just      make arrangements with a number of service stations to pick      up their old casings every week or two (plan your schedule,      of course, so that it's most convenient for everyone      involved).    </p>    <p>      If you have the storage space, you'll probably be dollars      ahead in the long run if you stockpile the discards you      collect through the spring and summer . .. and then sell      them all in the fall, when demand for the casings is      highest.    </p>    <p>      Whenever you've collected enough old tires to make it      worthwhile, you may be able to talk a retreader into      sending a truck to your place to pick up a whole load of      the carcasses at his expense.    </p>    <p>      You'll be amazed at how good some of the discarded tires      you handle will be . . . many are hardly worn at all and      still have thousands of miles of service left in them.      There's nothing wrong with carefully inspecting some of      them, saving them out, and using them on your own vehicles.      Then, when they really are worn out, you can sell them to      your recapped    </p>       <h3> IN CLOSING...</h3>    <p>      I've been collecting old tires from service stations and      recycling them to retreading shops for a long time now and      I keep on doing it because I've never found-for me,      at least-an easier or a better way to make good money      on a part-time basis.    </p>    <p>      I like the idea of being able to work this little      enterprise on an "any time and for as long as I want"      basis. I also like the fact that I can net $100 a day or      more nearly any time I choose to operate my part-time      business. (That's based on collecting only 100 recappable      tires in a day ... and, believe it or not, my brother and I      once picked up over 360 good casings in just somewhat more      than two hours! Once you're organized, you should find 100      a day a snap.)    </p>    <p>      And, finally, I like the fact that I can work my little      entrepreneurial venture by myself any time I want . . . or,      if I feel like it, with someone else. As I've just      mentioned, I've operated the business with my brother at      some times and, at others, with my wife. And, as I stated      at the beginning of this article, I feel that this is an      especially good little moneymaker for a back-to-the-land      husband and wife team.    </p>    <p>      And that pretty well describes my lady and me right now.      We've set our goal (a move to the country) and our tire      recycling business is helping us realize it. And, maybe,      that's the part I like best of all about our      mini-enterprise: We're [1] building a better life for      ourselves by [2] solving a "pollution" problem for service      stations while [3] recycling and helping to stretch the      useful life of tiresthat would otherwise be burned or      thrown in the dump. We feel good about every aspect of our      business.    </p>       <h3> But What Do You Do With Casings That Can't Be      Recapped?</h3>    <p>      Years ago, a Kansas wheat farmer named L.F. Schumacher      began to draw big royalties from the gas and oil leases he      sold on his land. And with some of that money, he set up an      office in Meade, Kansas. And in front of tht office, he had      a cocoa mat for people to wipe their feet on.    </p>    <p>      Well sir, one night somebody stole that mat. So ole L.F.      thought about that for a few days and then he bolted a      knife to one of his tractors and he pulled an old tire      around past that knife and-slick as a      whistle-sliced the tire into two strips. And that      worked so well that L.F. experimented some more and, within      a few months, he'd applied for a patent on a machine that      nearly anybody could use to slice old tires into long      strips and then assemble those strips into floor mats.    </p>    <p>      One thing led to another after that, as always happen when      somone comes up with a really worthwhile new idea, and      Schuhmacher moved to Chicago and set up a firm called      S.& S. Patents, Inc. And, according to some 1968      letters that L.F. wrote to one of MOTHER's editors, more      than 1,700 little shops had been set up at that time to use      S. & S. equipment to turn old worn-out tires into shop,      atheletic, and horse trailer mats. A great many of these      little enterprises were netting $5,000 to $6,000 a month      for private operators. And the rest of the recycling      mini-factories were providing useful jobs for the      disadvantaged at sheltered workshops, missions, halfway      houses, and other such public service institutions.    </p>    <p>      We had fond hopes of giving a big, fat, free plug to S.      & S. Patents, Inc., in this space because we like the      idea of recycling even unrecappable tires into useful items      (especially if there's the chance that MOTHER's readers      might be able to get in on the action and have yet another      shot at setting up even more little businesses that might      finance even more moves to the self-reliant way of life).    </p>    <p>      But, for the past three or four years, we simply haven't      been able to track S. & S. Patents, Inc., down      anywhere. The company doesn't seem to be at its old Chicago      address, its old phone number has been given to a private      family, and-in general-S. & S. seems to      have evaporated without a trace. We're guessing that L.F.      finally passed away and his company was either liquidated      or sold to someone else (and, if sold, moved to another      town).    </p>    <p>      So: Who's going to come to the rescue of MOTHER and her      readers? Who out there knows if the S. & S. machines      are still being manufactured? Who knows where we might find      a used one? Who knows of a shop happily engaged in the      manufacture of floor mats from old, discarded, unrecappable      tires? Who can give us any leads at all on this subject?      -The Editors.    </p>
