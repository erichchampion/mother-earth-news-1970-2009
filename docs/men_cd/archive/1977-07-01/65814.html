                         <h5 id="byline">by ALDEN STAHR</h5>      <p>      <strong>There aren't many part-time jobs that'll allow you      to [1] work outdoors, [2] meet people, [3] provide a      much-needed service, [4] set your own hours, and [5] earn      up to $10 an hour when you do decide to work. This one      will, though . . . and you can operate the service      successfully almost anywhere that people live on this      continent.</strong><br />      <br />    </p>		    <p>      Several years ago-when my teenage son, Stan, and I      moved to Alden's Walden (our cabin in the wilds of      northwestern New Jersey)-the two of us stumbled onto      a nifty moneymaking activity that nearly anybody can use to      earn a substantial income just about anywhere. I'm talking      about mowing grass.    </p>    <p>      Actually, young Stan is the one who got us started in this      lucrative line of work. After fixing up an old 18" rotary      push mower and earning enough money with it to buy a new      Sears pusher mower, Stan persuaded me to buy a repairable      riding-tractor-type grass cutter from a junk dealer for      $75. Shortly after that, Number One Son sweet-talked me      into spending $1,400 I didn't have for a John Deere Model      110 tractor with a 36" mower. We clipped grass with the      JD-110 as partners for one season, then traded <em>it</em>      in on a $2,100 JD-140H3 with hydraulics and a 48"-wide cut.      Three May-to-October seasons of part-time work later, Stan      and I tallied up our gross income . . . and found that we'd      earned no less than $8,000!    </p>    <p>      We can't guarantee, of course, that you'll do as well with      your own "mow for dough" operation. But then again, there's      no reason why-given the information contained in this      article and a few hundred dollars' worth of      equipment-you <em>can't</em> do as well as Stan and I      did . . . if not better!    </p>    <h3>THE EQUIPMENT YOU'LL NEED</h3>    <p>      No matter how large-or small-a mowing operation      you intend to have, you'll need [1] a whipstick or scythe      for cutting down extra-tall weeds, [2] hand clippers for      close work around steps, trees, etc., [3] a grass rake, [4]      a basket, [5] a gas can, [6] oil, [7] spare blades for your      mower, and [8] hand tools for fix-ups. It also pays to      carry an axe and a bucksaw wherever you go, since you never      know when you'll find a downed tree or tree limbs on the      lawn you're about to clip. (This has happened to us more      than once.)    </p>    <p>      About mowers: For most residential lawn-cutting jobs, an      18" walking mower (either a "push" rotary or a      self-propelled machine) will suffice. A machine larger than      18" will cut faster than a smaller model, but will be      awkward to use around shrubbery. Remember, too, that      self-propelled mowers-while easier on the legs than      push-type machines- <em>are</em> slow, and can be      difficult to back up (especially when you're backing up      uphill), since they're a good deal heavier than      non-propelled mowers. (Note: Be sure to carry a      grass-catcher bag for those occasions when grass removal is      required by the customer.)    </p>    <p>      Jobs involving up to several acres of lawn require a riding      tractor with a 36" or 48" cut, in addition to a walking      mower and the equipment listed above. Since tractor prices      vary a great deal, you should shop around before buying. In      general, one of the rigs with a handlift and gearshift      costs considerably less than one with "the works"      (hydraulic controls, power steering, etc.). Figure on      paying $800 to $2,000 for a gearshift tractor with a 36"      mower, $2,500 to $3,000 for one with a 48" swath, and about      $4,000 for a machine that'll cut a path 60" wide.    </p>    <p>      For truly vast expanses of verdure (and for brush-shredding      assignments) you'll need special heavy-duty equipment . . .      at least a 20-horsepower tractor with a 60" rotary mower      (or gang reel mowers) for lawns, and a sickle bar if you      intend to cut hay.    </p>    <p>      In addition, for heavily weeded areas and/or shredding jobs      you should consider a bush hog. Most five-to eight-foot      "hogs" have rotary blades, although some feature a      hammermill action that cuts by whirling short chains      studded with knives or chisels. The biggest bush hogs (and      they come as large as 12 feet across and wider) can only be      pulled by very powerful tractors and are quite expensive. I      doubt, however, that you'll need to start with anything      larger than, say, a $375 four-foot bush hog.    </p>    <p>      When buying lawn-care equipment, it pays to do some      homework first, <em>before</em> putting any money down.      Check <em>Consumer Reports</em> , look into the reputations      of local dealers, and ask people who've bought lawn      tractors what their experience has been. As with cars, some      tractors are remarkably trouble-free, while others smack of      yellow citrus fruit. (Our first John Deere was great . . .      only one problem in 200 hours of mowing. The second machine      had 37 breakdowns in two seasons.) Nearby service is      essential, so try to purchase your rig reasonably close to      home.    </p>    <p>      All of the tractors I've used (and that includes a good      many makes and models) have had their problems, so I can't      recommend any one or two or three brands in particular. I      will say this, though: The more automatic a tractor is, the      more likely (in my experience) you are to have trouble. Get      a machine that's simple to operate and easy to take apart      and repair, and you'll be dollars ahead in the long run.    </p>   <h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>    <p>      Obviously, you're going to need a good set of wheels      forgetting yourself and your equipment to and from your      jobs. When we started out, Stan and I carried our push      mowers and the $75 riding tractor in my Jeep Commando.      Later, I made a utility trailer that-along with two      oak planks for loading and a combination of chains, load      binders (chain tighteners), and nylon ropes (with which we      secured everything to the trailer)-proved more than      adequate for hauling our JD-110.    </p>    <p>      The JD-140, however, was too wide for the utility trailer      and wouldn't fit in a 49"wide pickup truck bed, so I bought      a tilttop snowmobile trailer for $250 and used <em>it</em>      to transport the tractor. Talk about easy loading: All we      did was tip the rear end of the trailer down, drive up in      the JD, crashland to a level attitude, and tie everything      down with chains, load binders, and ropes as before. (There      are better-but far more expensive-tilt-top      trailers with hydraulic restraints that let the load down      gently, but I never saw the need to buy one.)    </p>    <p>      We were always super-conscientious about tying our tractor      securely to the trailer, and we recommend that you      be-if anything-over-cautious too. One local JD      owner thought that just setting the brakes of his tractor      was all the precaution he needed to take to keep it on his      trailer. And it was . . . until the day it bounced off on      the highway and got squashed.    </p>    <p>      If you do transport your rig on a trailer (homemade or      otherwise), be sure to check with your local motor vehicle      agency about roadability requirements. Here in New Jersey,      a trailer is required to have all the lights a car has:      tail lights, brake lights, <em>and</em> turn signals. Also,      a standard hitch and safety chains must be used . . . and      the trailer must be licensed. Find out what the trailer      laws are where you live, and abide by them.    </p>    <p>      Also, check your insurance. Does it provide liability      coverage while the trailer is being towed? Does your      tractor have fire, theft, and hull coverage?    </p>    <p>      A final word of advice: Always carry a come-along (hand      winch) and chains so that you can load a dead tractor with      muscle power if you have to in an emergency.    </p>    <h3>BE READY WITH RATES</h3>    <p>      You'll need to establish some sort of fee schedule before      you begin your first job. Start by inquiring about the      prevailing charges for lawn-mowing in your locality. When I      bought our first John Deere tractor, I asked the dealer      what the going rate was and he "thought it might be" $7.00      an hour. We asked that and got it easily. The second year,      we bought a bigger JD and raised our charges to $8.00 an      hour. The year after that, our price went to $10 an hour      (to cover higher gasoline, labor, and other costs). If this      seems steep, just remember that the fee included two      operators working two machines (a tractor and a trimming      mower) at once.    </p>    <p>      Many customers-the ones who see an hourly rate as an      invitation to a slow drag-prefer a contract (or "lump      sum") price to a by-the-hour charge. My advice is to figure      on the high side if a firm price must be given in advance.      Consider every possible factor in your estimate: roughness      of terrain, grass height, amount of moisture (which can      slow you down), the number of trees and shrubs to cut      around, how much hand trimming will be required to finish      the job, etc. And don't just guess at the size of a green .      . . pace if off. (It helps to remember that an acre is a      square measuring approximately 210 feet on a side.) If you      <em>don't</em> take all these factors into account (and      remain unflinchingly realistic in your estimate), you may      well end up losing your jeans.    </p>    <p>      Of course, in the final analysis, there's only one way to      get a feel for how long it'll take you to mow a given      amount of lawn, and that's to practice mowing. I strongly      recommend you do so.    </p>   <h3> HOW TO GET BUSINESS</h3>    <p>      When you're finally ready to launch your service, you've      got to <em>make your</em> <em>existence known</em> . Leave      word at garages, lawn equipment dealers, feed stores,      general stores, and the post office. Place an ad in the      local paper. ("Large lawns mowed" was our tag line.) Visit,      write, or phone nearby institutions that have large lawns.      Advise your local radio station. And by all means tell your      neighbors and friends. (Word of mouth advertising is the      best kind.)    </p>    <p>      I landed our biggest job simply by doing a little      investigating. One day-as I was passing through the      Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area-I noticed      several large, thoroughly overgrown lawns surrounding some      homes and estates that the Park Service had taken over. I      sought out the appropriate official and asked if we could      mow the pasture-like expanses of grass. Our timing must've      been perfect, because (much to our gratification) the      answer was "yes".    </p>    <p>      No big lawns in your area? Other opportunities exist. At      our former homestead, I used my Allis-Chalmers "C" tractor      and a six-foot sickle bar to do contract cutting of hay.      (I've also made money clipping brush and high weeds with an      A-C tractor fitted with an eight-foot bush hog.) And, after      the regular mowing season was over (October, in this area)      Stan and I found we could still rig a shield over the exit      chute of our mower and get work mulching the leaves on      lawns.    </p>    <p>      The opportunities are there. All you have to do is seek      them out.    </p>    <h3>COLLECTIONS</h3>    <p>      Some customers pay cash upon completion.      Others-including the National Park      Service-prefer to be billed monthly. A few others,      alas, never pay up at all.    </p>    <p>      Most of the people we dealt with were honest and agreeable,      I'm glad to say, but we did have a couple of "cuss-tomers".      One was a fast-talking "big operator" who said he wanted      his place manicured and never mind the cost. He paid for      the first two mowings, then-when the bills for the      third and fourth jobs were sent-skipped town. Another      guy was very apologetic and kept explaining that his      "foundation grants weren't coming through". He, too, moved      away and left us holding the grass-bag.    </p>    <p>      What can you do about customers that rip you off? Ideally,      you should always have all your clients sign written      agreements in advance. That way, if polite persistence      doesn't get you your money you can take non-payers to small      claims court and win a judgment against them. We made the      mistake, in the beginning, of not requiring customers to      sign a work order . . . and-as a result-we had      nothing on which to base a small claims action.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, once you find out who your past-due customers      are-and there'll probably always be a few-you      should drop'em like a hot exhaust pipe!    </p>   <h3>ACCOUNTING AND TAXES</h3>    <p>      Sad to say, you <em>will</em> have to keep accounts in this      (as in any) business, both for your own future information      and for the benefit of the Internal Revenue Service. I      recommend that you keep a pad and pencil in your tow      vehicle and take down dates, towing mileages, working      hours, and expenditures as they occur. (You'll be glad you      did when income tax time rolls around . . . or whenever you      feel the need to compute your profits/losses.) Likewise,      save all receipts (your expenses are deductible) and be      sure to take depreciation on equipment when it comes to      filling out Schedule C of Form 1040.    </p>    <p>      Since accounting is not my forte, I get a tax lawyer to do      our returns. The peace of mind-to me-is worth      the expense . . . and anyway, the expense is deductible.    </p>   <h3> A REWARDING JOB</h3>    <p>      Now that Stanley and I have become experienced      grass-cutters, we're convinced that the "mow for dough"      business has a lot going for it. For instance: You can get      started with a minimum of equipment (equipment you probably      already have <em>anyway</em> ) . . . you get to work      outdoors and meet people . . . you can put in as      many-or as few-hours as you want . . . and the      pay is pretty decent. As I said earlier, Stan and I took      home $8,000 in three seasons of part-time work . . . and      man, that ain't hay!    </p>       <h3>PRE-MOWING CHECKLIST</h3>       <p>      [1] Level the mower on a flat surface. Then-using a      block of wood of the appropriate thickness-check the      height of the blades above the mowing surface. (We use a      cutting height of 2" most of the time and 3" during the      late summer and/or dry weather.)    </p>    <p>      [2] Sharpen blades daily. Use a good bench grinder, and      touch up the cutting edges from the top only. (When      mounting the blades, make sure the "fan" portion is on      top.)    </p>    <p>      [3] Check belt tension.    </p>    <p>      [4] Checkpoints and plug(s).<br />    </p>    <p>      [5] Grease your machine and check its oil.    </p>    <p>      [6] Change the oil in your tractor if more than 20 working      hours have elapsed since the last oil change.<br />    </p>    <p>      [7] Check your machine's air cleaner. (Pay particular      attention to this item when dandelion puffs, pollen, or      dust are in the air.)    </p>    <p>      [8] Use a safety chute to keep the mower from shooting      stones at people or windows.    </p>    <p>      [9] If exhaust fumes bother you, rig up a short exhaust      elbow that will blow the fumes forward, down, and away from      you.- <em>AS.</em>    </p>
