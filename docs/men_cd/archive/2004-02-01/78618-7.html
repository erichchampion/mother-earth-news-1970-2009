        Belted Galloways are rugged cattle known for their abilities to forage and to withstand harsh winter condistions; they're a focus of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy efforts, too. These Belted Galloways are owned by Karen and John Thornton of Big Creek Farms, Mount Vernon, Iowa. Karen is an ALBC board member.
