            		            <p>      These big bugs were obvious inside our garden many years      before we had children, but the youngsters, being close to      the ground, forced us to slow down and pay attention to      them. The bugs were given names, professions and lifestyles      (lucky for them, they were too small to dress in doll      clothes), and their habits were studied closely, too.<br />      <br />      The tremendous numbers of small insect eggs laid in      temperate and tropical habitats make it imperative that a      number of slightly larger creatures be available as diners,      to help control this mania for multiplication. The ground      beetles, or Carabidae, are just one of the largely      predacious insect families designed for the job. They      number at least 2,500 species in North America, and both      adults and larvae are predacious. A majority are dark in      color, and some have a distinctive shiny or metallic sheen.    </p>        <p>      One of the beauties of diversity lies in the seemingly      redundant layers of organisms that almost, but don't quite,      duplicate one another's purpose. Within the ground beetle      family, a few eat seeds, a few concentrate near water, and      some readily climb trees and consume arboreal insects,      including aphids and forest tent caterpillars. One species      is commonly found in beaver lodges!    </p>    <p>      But most are terrestrial predators. Of those, some      specialize in eating a certain type of insect adult or      larvae, but most are not what you'd call discriminating      diners. Most of the carabids are nocturnal, and they can      move quickly on the ground. Many are big relative to their      wing size, which makes them poor flyers; you'll nearly      always see them walking.    </p>    <p>      The head is noticeably smaller than the thorax, too, with      very thin, threadlike antennae. This beetle's other      noticeable feature is a set of parallel lines on the front      wings that serve as the cover for the hind (flight) wings      and abdomen. If you look closely, you will see on some      species, these lines are actually rows of small dots or      pits. Also, some species can emit a strong, foul odor if      handled-we found this out firsthand.    </p>    <p>      Many garden pests are carabid food: cutworms, codling moth      larvae, tent caterpillars, slugs, snails and cankerworms to      name a few. Some beneficial insects will fall prey to them,      too.    </p>    <p>      If you are using mulches in your garden, you are providing      good carabid habitat. Leaf litter and such are good places      for ground beetles to look for food and to hide themselves      from their own predators. Many hibernate in litter as well.      Most carabids pass through one full generation in a year,      but the process takes longer in colder climates. If you are      in need of a half-hour dose of sunlight, consider finding a      friendly ground beetle and saying 'hello.'    </p>    <p>      <em>- John Stuart</em>    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
