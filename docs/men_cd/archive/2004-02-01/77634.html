                		<h5 id="byline">		Edited by Carol Mack		</h5>        <p>      <strong>New England &</strong> <strong>Maritime      Canada</strong>    </p>    <p>      When February starts to feel interminable, get outside and      do some skiing, skating or walking. Put on a pair of      snowshoes and pack down the snow around all your fruit      trees. The packed snow is difficult for rodents to burrow      through and may help reduce chewing damage to tree trunks.      Then, warm up back indoors. Sit in the sun with a cup of      hot tea or soup, some homemade dried cantaloupe slices and      a stack of seed catalogs. Soon, March will bring noticeably      longer days, with the sweet smell of spring hanging in the      evening air, and you'll be back in the garden again. By      then, overwintered and newly seeded greens will be      sprouting; try sowing some cilantro, spinach, mustard and      mache this year. The first genuine mud appears, too, so      don't get out your garden fork yet. Instead, a sunny day      makes cleaning out the greenhouse a welcome task.    </p>    <p>      In late March when you're out and about, don't forget to      listen for the "Peent" call of the male woodcock as he      whirls skyward, claiming territory and calling a mate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mid-Atlantic</strong>    </p>    <p>      "F" is for February and "f' is for flats. Early in the      month, pull out the flats and start eggplant, parsley,      celeriac, habanero peppers and the last of the dry bulb      onions. In mid-February, seed other peppers, broccoli,      cauliflower, cabbage, celery, Chinese greens and lettuce.      By the end of the month, start the fast tomato seedlings.      Try 'Zarnitsa,' a cold-tolerant Russian variety, for an      extra-early harvest, 'Mule Team' for heavy main-season      production of top-notch fruits and 'Strawberry Red'      (sometimes called 'German Red Strawberry') for an      exceptional slicing tomato. In early March, transplant      raspberries and blackberries, and shortly after St.      Patrick's Day (March 17), plant potatoes. 'Red Cloud,'      'Carols' and 'Rose Apple Finn' are regional favorites with      high yields and disease resistance.    </p>    <p>      Also in mid-March, start transplanting cold-hardy greens      (but keep them under row covers), and begin biweekly      sowings of beets, carrots and radishes. Spring has arrived!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southern Interior</strong>    </p>    <p>      Time to start tomato, pepper and eggplant seeds indoors.      When the seedlings get their first true leaves, move them      to 3-inch pots to grow on until after the frostfree date      for your area. Then, transplant them outside.    </p>    <p>      Plant cool-weather starts like broccoli and cabbage      outdoors, and sow English peas, snow peas and sweet snap      peas now, before the weather warms up. Try 'Maestro,' a      great, high-yielding English pea variety. Also, the nearly      leafless 'Sugar Lace II' sweet snap pea and 'Snow Wind'      snow pea devote their efforts to producing delicious peas      and don't waste energy on extra leaves. Along with edible      peas, plant some ornamental sweet peas for their wonderful      fragrances and charming flowers; 'Matucana' is a beautiful      heirloom variety.    </p>    <p>      And don't forget the perennials! It's a good time to clean      up any lingering dead foliage from last year. Also, many      fall-flowering shrubs and trees can be pruned safely      through March.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gulf Coast</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you haven't already worked compost into the garden,      now's the time. Remember, the gardener with the most      compost wins! Use transplants in February for a quick crop      of lettuce and broccoli before the weather heats up and the      plants bolt. Brave souls transplant their tomatoes as early      as mid-February. These early plants may not last as long      into the season, but July usually ends it for tomatoes in      our region anyway. Don't forget cherry tomatoes, either.      'Sweet 100' and the old-time 'Porter,' now an heirloom, are      hard to beat; these small-fruited varieties can take the      summer heat and continue to produce.    </p>    <p>      Cool temperatures can stunt peppers and eggplants, so hold      off on planting these until mid-March, when it's OK to put      out all the warm-season crops. Spray fruit trees with      horticultural oil just before bud-break; this is when      overwintering insects are at their weakest and, therefore,      most susceptible to this low-toxicity pesticide.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Central/Midwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      Even though the weather looks like winter, this is the time      to work on your summer garden. Start seeds of vegetables      like onion, leek, pepper, eggplant and tomato now. To keep      them from stretching as they grow, maintain a strong light      source at 4 inches above the plants (see "Use the Right      Light for Seed-starting Success," Page 108). Fertilize      seedlings after six weeks, and transplant them to bigger      pots as needed.    </p>    <p>      For the flower garden, start perennial seeds now, too. Many      varieties grown from seed will bloom the first year, making      them attractive additions to your garden bed. Annuals to      start right away include geraniums, begonias, snapdragons,      petunias and impatiens. Hold off on celosias or you will      not have optimum garden performance from the plant. Your      best results for starting plants from seed will be obtained      by using a good-quality seeding mix, having adequate light      and following the growing instructions for each variety.      Have fun!    </p>    <p>      <strong>North Central & Rockies</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most plants are very sensitive to day length. When day      length increases, they immediately begin to add new growth.      We are reminded of this every year when we see intense new      growth on our indoor tomatoes and herbs beginning after the      winter solstice (Dec. 22 in 2003; Dec. 21 in 2004).    </p>    <p>      Tomatoes, peppers and herbs for the next growing season can      catch this wave of momentum; large growing containers will      keep them from becoming root-bound before outdoor      temperatures warm.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, gather your arsenal of season-extenders to melt      the snow and warm the soil: Fabric row covers and cold      frames can transform the March garden from lion to lamb,      boosting the growth of young transplants and seeds. The      real payoff is a late-spring harvest that occurs while      other gardeners are just getting started.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pacific Northwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      The dormant season for Pacific Northwest gardeners      officially is past, and plenty of tasks await to help you      get back into the swing of gardening. Vegetables such as      cole crops, eggplants, onions, peppers and tomatoes really      need to be started indoors in order to mature in a timely      fashion. Due to our lack of sunlight in the early spring,      seed starting on the windowsill usually results in leggy      plants, so artificial lighting is preferred (see "Use the      Right Light for Seed-starting Success," Page 108). If you      are new to starting seeds under lights, don't be skeptical;      it's not difficult or expensive.    </p>    <p>      Outdoors, sow cold-hardy crops like lettuce, spinach, other      leafy greens and peas. If it takes a while for the seeds to      germinate, have patience, as these seeds usually will      survive in the soil until it warms to the proper      temperature. If you're impatient, try spreading clear      plastic over the garden beds for a few weeks prior to      planting; the plastic will speed up the natural seasonal      warming of the soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      These last months of winter offer a pause to prepare for      spring. Even in areas that still freeze at night and      threaten another snowstorm, reprieves of sunny days come      more frequently, and we can start to clean up the garden      space. Finish pulling out and composting any leftover crops      from last season and cut back perennial plants to a few      inches to encourage new growth.    </p>    <p>      Order bulbs and seeds (remember to include seeds for cover      crops). Stock up on compost, potting soil and fertilizers,      or find and haul these materials from local sources to      create your own. Be sure you're not bringing home any      materials contaminated with pesticides. In the mountains,      cover crops still are growing slowly, but in warmer areas,      they should be mowed and turned under before they reach      knee high or turn brown. By March, greenhouse planting is      in full swing. If you're hungry for spring salads, plant      outside and use cloches or fabric row covers to protect and      warm your seedlings where night freezes still threaten.    </p>    <p>      Our thanks to the following for their contributions to the      Almanac:<br />      <strong>Roberta Bailey, FEDCO Seeds</strong> , Waterville,      Maine;<br />      <strong>Cricket Rakita, Southern Exposure Seed      Exchange</strong> , Mineral, Virginia;<br />      <strong>Lori Hardee and Karen Park Jennings, Park Seed      Company</strong> , Greenwood, South Carolina;<br />      <strong>William D.
