                    <p>      Tiny, twisted tubers show market potential.  </p>		<h5 id="byline">      By Doreen G. Howard    </h5>        <p>      They're about the size of a chess piece, and they look like      micromini Michelin men. Their French name, crosnes, is      pronounced "crones," which brings an image of gnarly, old      women to mind. Why should you care? Crosnes <em>(Stachys      affinis),</em> also known as Chinese artichokes or chorogi,      are a gourmet sensation at upscale restaurants and green      grocers, and they're not to be missed by adventurous eaters      and market gardeners alike. The crisp, juicy little tubers      bring up to $40 a pound, retail, and enhance any salad,      stir-fry or saute. Market potential abounds, as food      magazines and television cooking shows tout the tuber's      tasty trendiness. Plus, the little delights are easy to      grow and fun to eat.    </p>    <p>      A perennial root vegetable and member of the mint family,      crosnes can be planted in a flower bed, around a landscape      shrub or as a field crop. Plants form a mat of attractive,      spearmint-like leaves during the summer. When the foliage      turns brown in autumn, the tiny tubers are harvested in the      same manner as potatoes.    </p>    <p>      Cooking is optional with crosnes, as they are crunchy and      full of juice right out of the ground. Wipe them clean or      briefly soak them in water to remove any dirt. They are too      tiny to peel, and much of their flavor is in the skin      anyway.    </p>    <p>      Eat crosnes raw as a snack. Throw them in a salad for a      radishlike crunch. Or pickle them for a real conversation      piece. They shine in stir-fried dishes as a crispy      alternative to water chestnuts. A piece of fish with      crosnes and asparagus tips sauteed in garlic and olive oil      makes for a fast, attractive gourmet entree, or serve them      like the French-steamed and dressed with butter      sauce.    </p>    <p>      Odessa Piper, chef-owner of an upscale Madison, Wisconsin,      restaurant called L'Etoile, first sampled crosnes more than      five years ago in Paris. "All the knots and ridges catch      and hold sauces perfectly," she says. To put them on the      menu of her own eatery, she turned to organic growers      Richard de Wilde and Linda Halley, owners of Harmony Valley      Farm in Viroqua, Wisconsin. De Wilde and Halley already      were selling organic produce to Piper, who is a member of      the Chefs Collaborative, a group that promotes local      chef/organic grower relationships, so the market gardeners      soon were turning out crosnes, too. The couple also sells      organic produce to other area restaurants, at the Dane      County, Wisconsin, Farmer's Market and through the Harmony      Valley Farm CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) produce      subscription program.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CULTURE</strong>    </p>    <p>      "You can plant the tubers in fall or early spring, in full      sun and in any soil that drains reasonably well," says de      Wilde. Once planted, the tubers need a steady supply of      moisture until harvest to make a crop. "It is easy to      detect when they start to produce," he says. "The plants      grow very shallowly, so you can see the ground crack and      heave when the tubers start to swell." Two to three weeks      later, they're ready to eat, cook-or pickle, as      Halley often does.    </p>    <p>      Spacing can make or break production, according to another      crosnes fan, William Woys Weaver. He's been growing the      little tubers for more than 20 years in the gardens      surrounding his historic 1805 home, formerly the Lamb      Tavern, in Devon, Pennsylvania. A food historian, seed      collector and author of numerous books-including      <em>Heirloom Vegetable Gardening</em> and, most recently,      <em>Country Scrapple, An American Tradition</em> (Stackpole      Books)-Weaver says to plant crosnes 3 inches deep and      at least 12 inches apart for a harvest of big tubers. When      the tubers are dug, he adds, it's impossible to find them      all, but the ones that are missed will sprout the following      spring; those volunteers should be thinned in the spring to      12 inches apart, too.    </p>    <p>      Cropping, or shearing the foliage back, also is important      with crosnes, Weaver says, noting the plants should never      be allowed to flower. When his crosnes' foliage reaches a      foot in height, he shears it back to 6 inches or less.      "Cropping directs growth into the roots, resulting in      larger crosnes and at least five or six crosnes from each      plant. The big ones go to market, and the little ones go      back in the ground. The French are meticulous gardeners and      crop regularly, knowing they will get premium tubers."    </p>    <p>      If conditions are perfect, each plant can produce up to a      dozen big tubers, he adds, noting such conditions are warm      days; cool nights; rich, sandy ground and plenty of water.      "Crosnes grow in the wild on stream banks and near them,"      he says. "They are very sensitive to drought and will die      from lack of water." Weaver lost his entire crop during the      drought of 2002, but replanted a 16-by-16-foot bed last      spring. The only pest problems he has encountered are moles      and voles. "They will eat them," he says.    </p>    <p>      Purchased or pot-started plants can be set out in the      spring to get a head start on tuber production. Several      mail-order companies sell crosne plants as ornamentals for      about $4 each; large-scale plantings of the tubers are more      cost effective, but a single plant or two will supply      enough tubers for tasting and future home-use (see source      list, Page 79).    </p>    <p>      Store crosnes in plastic bags at a temperature of 35 to 40      degrees over the winter for spring planting, or plant them      in the fall, before the ground freezes solidly, and the      tubers will sprout the following spring. Don't forget to      thin them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HARVEST & CLEANING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Carol Deppe, a Corvallis, Oregon, plant breeder and author      of <em>Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties: The Farmer's and      Gardener's Guide to Plant Breeding and Seed Saving,</em>      grew crosnes in pure compost several years ago to help a      local farmer develop new specialty crops. They planted a      4-by-20-foot bed in a field that had an 8-inch layer of      compost spread on top of tilled soil, and got a generous      harvest, although they didn't document the increase.    </p>    <p>      In terms of commercial viability, though, Deppe says, the      real issue is the hand labor needed to harvest the tiny      crosnes. Weaver, whose Pennsylvania ground doesn't freeze      hard in winter, hand-harvests crosnes year-round from his      garden bed. De Wilde harvests by hand, too, in season in      Wisconsin, from his 500-foot field rows. "You turn over the      plant with a spading fork and pick the little things by      hand," he says. "Crosnes are not conducive to any      mechanical means of harvest."    </p>    <p>      Anticipating handling commercial volumes in Oregon, Deppe      experimented successfully with a harvest screen. She      attached a piece of 1/2-inch galvanized mesh between two      8-foot-long bamboo poles to form an 8-by-3-foot frame for      screening. "We propped up one end of the screen on a      wheelbarrow and spaded the plants, compost and all, up onto      the frame," she says. "With a little pushing around, the      tubers were screened free of the compost and other debris,      which fell back into the bed. Hand sorting is still      necessary, but it's easier with most of the debris gone. In      addition, you can raise the frame and work standing or      sitting comfortably instead of crouching."    </p>    <p>      Cleaning dirt and other debris from lots of tiny, twisted      tubers can be a bit of a challenge, too.    </p>    <p>      Adding sand to the growing medium helps, Deppe and Weaver      say, and Weaver soaks his crosnes in a bucket of water,      too. "Then I scrub each one with a veterinarian's horse      toothbrush," he says. (A vegetable brush or toothbrush      would work well, too, if you don't have a horse toothbrush      handy.) De Wilde soaks his crosnes as well, and then dumps      them on mesh trays to be scrubbed clean by high-pressure      water jets.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> contributing editor Doreen Howard is a      food and garden writer who lives near Chicago.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Crosnes    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Tuber & Plant Sources</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>TUBERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Harmony Valley Farm</strong><br />      S. 3442 Wire Hollow Road<br />      Viroqua, WI 54665<br />      (608) 483-2143 <a href="http://www.harmonyvalleyfarm.com" target="_blank">www.harmonyvalleyfarm.com</a> Available after      Nov. 15. $20 per half-pound, postpaid.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marche aux Delices</strong><br />      P.O.
