                        <p>      You moved out of the city to get away from disturbances and      crime. Now instead of worrying about unruly teenagers and      vandals, you have 300-pound prowlers in the form of black      bears, <em>Ursus americanus</em> , who don't understand      property lines.    </p>    <p>      With the following simple precautions from the American      Bear Association, you can share space more safely with      these magnificent creatures. After all, we are living on      what was once their turf. Endemic to North America, the      black bear once roamed through forests across the      continent. Although growing human populations have severely      reduced this traditional range, black bears still can be      found in relatively undisturbed forested regions in 40      states and throughout Canada. In the Northeast and      mid-Atlantic states, black bear populations are even slowly      expanding, but they nevertheless face constantly      encroaching development by humans. With less area to      forage, bears are naturally going to look for food on the      borders between their country and ours-the areas most      attractive to homesteaders, too.    </p>        <p>      Black bears are naturally afraid of humans, though. If a      bear shows up in your yard, it's probably responding to      your unintentional invitation. With their keen sense of      smell, bears can detect miniscule amounts of leftover food      or garbage. Here are the ABA's tips for managing ursine      visitors that may turn up in your yard:    </p>    <p>      Don't leave garbage cans outside. It may be trash to you,      but it's a smorgasbord to bears. Instead, store your trash      in a secure building, such as a garage, and keep smelly      items wrapped in plastic in the freezer until pick-up day.      If you must store trash outdoors, consider a "bear-proof'      container (see "Bear-proof ..." below).<br />      Bring your bird feeders in at night. Bears like berries,      nuts, grasses, carrion, insects and birdseed. They also      will go for the sugar water in hummingbird feeders. If you      don't want to bring in feeders every night, hang them at      least 10 feet off the ground on wire suspended between two      trees. Also consider only feeding birds between December      and April-the time frame when most bears are      hibernating.<br />      <br />      Protect your compost pile. Use only non-food items or use a      small electric fence or a trench-composting      technique.<br />      <br />      Don't store pet food outside. If you're going to feed Fido      alfresco, clean the bowl and pick up any scraps.<br />      <br />      Take care of your outdoor grills and burn barrels. Leftover      grease and food will attract bears. Don't dump grease or      charred meat anywhere outside, as bears eventually will      sniff it out. Store grills and bum barrels in secure areas      whenever possible.<br />      <br />      Be prepared to share your crops if you're not prompt at      harvesting them. Vegetables and fruits should be picked as      they ripen (for more reasons than just bears). If you are      late, clear away any overripe fruits and vegetables.<br />      <br />      Don't focus just on food. Bears like pretty much anything      with a strong smell. They'll sniff, claw, sample or rub      aromatic wood-such as cedar or pine-and      petroleum products-such as tarpaper, paint,      turpentine, kerosene and charcoal lighting fluid. It's best      to store this stuff inside.<br />      <br />      Watch your calendar. Bears couldn't care less about      livestock for most of the year. But if food is scarce, they      might take a chance during birthing season. If you are      worried about bears, keep expectant female livestock and      their young near protected enclosures. If you lose any      animals during this time, properly dispose of the      carcasses, preferably away from your stock. Use lime to      reduce the odor.    </p>        <p>      Should a black bear wander through your yard, it will      wander right back out if it is not rewarded with food. If      it does find a treat, you've issued an open invitation for      repeat visits. Feeding bears, whether intentionally or      unintentionally, will teach them to associate food with      people. This may compromise the safety of both humans and      bears. Negative encounters with black bears usually are the      result of bears reacting defensively rather than      aggressively.    </p>    <p>      Black bears are a cornerstone species of North American      wilderness and observing them can be a thrilling      experience. By understanding their needs, you can      peacefully cohabit with black bears to their benefit and      yours.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bear-proof</strong> <strong>Trash      Containers</strong>    </p>  <p>      <strong>Bearable Trash Solutions</strong><br />      105 B Dorsa Ave.<br />      Wayne, NJ 07470<br />      (973) 694-7467<br />    <a href="http://www.bearproofing.com" target="_blank">www.bearproofing.com</a>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BearProofInc.</strong><br />      234 S.

Do not approach a black bear. Do not run! Back      away slowly, holding your arms above your head. Try to look      as big as possible. If a bear lunges, snaps its jaws or      slaps the ground, you are too close. Restrain children and      dogs. Don't look the bear in the eyes. That's a threat in      the animal kingdom. Don't assume the bear is attacking if      it stands up. It may be trying to get a better look. If a      black bear does attack, <em>fight back.</em> Vigorously      punch and kick, especially at its nose and eyes. Get inside      if you can. If the bear is treed, it is probably scared.      Remove all threats and give it time to come down and get      away. (It may wait until after dark.)    </p>    <p>      The American Bear Association has more information on black      bears.
