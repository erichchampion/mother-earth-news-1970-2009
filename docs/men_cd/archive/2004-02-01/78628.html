                    <h3>The Other Chile Peppers </h3>    <p>Where does the heat come from in chiles?      Capsaicinoids-tasteless, odorless compounds that are      insoluble in water-can cause a "rapid bite" at the      back of the palate and throat or a long, slow burn on the      tongue. </p>    <p>      Peppers produce these compounds only in glands located in      their pods' placental partition, which is the white, fleshy      membrane where the seeds are attached. The seeds become      pungent through contact with the placenta but do not      contain capsaicinoids of their own. If you want less heat,      carefully remove the seeds and placental membrane before      you use the peppers.    </p>    <p>      So why do chile peppers produce these capsaicinoids? When      mammals eat peppers, they digest the seeds, destroying      them. When birds eat peppers, they pass the seeds intact.      Mammals can taste capsaicinoids, so peppers' heat may have      evolved as a way to protect the seeds from mammals and      allow birds to eat-and spread-them.    </p>    <p>      Scoville Heat Units (SHUs), developed in 1912 by Wilbur      Scoville, are the standard industry method of measuring      capsaicinoid levels. Originally, a precise amount of the      chile was soaked in alcohol to dissolve the capsaicinoids.      This, in turn, was dissolved in sugar water until a panel      of testers no longer could detect any heat. At least three      out of five testers had to agree on the dilution level. The      SHUs reflect the number of units of sugar water it took to      reach that point.    </p>    <p>      Today, high-performance liquid chromatography is used to      measure the actual capsaicinoid content in parts per      million, which is then converted to Scoville Units. Use any      measuring system only as a guide because heat content      varies by growing conditions, age, pod condition (fresh      versus dried, for instance), and individual reactions to      capsaicinoids.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
