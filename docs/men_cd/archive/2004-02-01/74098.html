                <p>      Green Homes    </p>            <h5 id="byline">	      By Maren Thompson Bzdek  </h5>    <p>      When architect David Sellers received an assignment to      build a home in Vermont's Green Mountains on a sharply      sloping, uncleared woodland site, he didn't hesitate to      take on the difficult project. In fact, he thought of it as      an exciting chance to flesh out his ideas for reducing both      the eyesore factor and the environmental impact of building      in a relatively unspoiled setting. It didn't hurt that the      client offered what every architect dreams of-a      nearly unlimited timeline and a great deal of budgetary and      creative control.    </p>    <p>      Sellers already had proved his mettle: Named as one of the      world's 100 foremost architects by Ambitectural Digest in      1992, he had achieved recognition for his emphasis on      designing with nature as well as his work with pedestrian      and human-scale settlement patterns.    </p>    <p>      The prospective homeowner did give Sellers a few important      guiding principles: He asked that the home reflect the      Japanese architectural traditions he'd come to love through      visits to his daughter-in-law's homeland-simple,      natural materials and a connection to the surrounding      environment-and he wanted trees to be in the      forefront of the design.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A DISCRETE FOOTPRINT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sellers began to plot a scheme for a structure that would      seem to grow right out of the hillside. "We tried to leave      the immediate surroundings wild. There's no lawn or garden,      just a few native plants for minimal landscaping," he says.      "An inch away from the house is wilderness."    </p>    <p>      Sellers carefully considered all of the treasures that      clearing the existing site would offer, from huge stone      slabs to stately, solid trees. "It's like a game of rock,      paper, scissors," he says. "You look at the choices      available to you, all of which might work, and consider      factors like aesthetics and embodied energy. Perhaps the      first choice has low embodied energy and is essentially      free because it's found on site. The second choice might be      economical as well because it's mass-produced, but it      involves a whole lot of embodied energy because of      manufacture and transportation. Then you have to think      about what other materials you'll use to go along with it.      For example, if you put in milled 2-by-4s, you have to use      a lot of other materials to cover them up and support them,      and that involves more embodied energy."    </p>    <p>      After local stone and salvaged trees were selected as the      major building materials, Sellers created a design that      relied on unsawn timber as the structure's vertical      supports. Construction began in 1996, but the house wasn't      completed until two years later.    </p>    <p>      Rick Moore, the contractor, had to throw out all      conventional timetables and procedures, and give in to the      demands of the site. "The land was so hard to work on," he      says. "We had to start at one end and work to the other,      piece by piece, in a sort of backwards fashion. All the      retaining walls and landscaping were done before we started      on the house. The framework of the tree supports was put in      place first, and everything was cut with chain saws, so it      was slow work. We did the framing through the winter."    </p>        <p>      Sellers' approach to the project was collaborative and      organic in nature, to say the least, Moore recalls. "There      was never any true architectural drawing, just sketches,"      he says. "They gave us a pretty good idea, but all of the      detailing was a surprise. Only the foundation had true      blueprints. And Sellers wasn't working very far ahead of      us. We used a clay model as our guide-and we had to      resurrect that from the architect's dumpster."    </p>    <p>      Looking at the holistic beauty of the finished project,      dubbed the "Tree House" because of the extensive use of      unsawn timber, one might find this story a bit hard to      believe. How could a house that seems so unusually grounded      in its place possibly have been created with conventional      building practices?    </p>    <p>      The roofline echoes the surrounding ridges and is designed      for snow to pile on its uphill, near-to-the-ground side so      the house blends in with the winter environment. "It's      designed so that, when the roof is covered with snow in the      winter, you can't even see the house from that side,"      Sellers says.    </p>    <p>      Because the house follows the site's natural undulations,      it was necessary to place the entrance at one end, with the      main hallway along the contour line. This means that all of      the public spaces-living room, dining room and eat-in      kitchen-are on the downhill side with the view. The      house snuggles up against the hill and opens up      dramatically to the outside, taking full advantage of      natural daylight.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LOCAL FLAVOR</strong>    </p>        <p>      The concept of using indigenous materials for the Tree      House was a top-down decision, starting with native Vermont      slate for the roof. "Then we realized we'd have big rocks      pulled from the site for the foundation, so we started      refining it even more-using peeled logs from the site      for the interior structure."    </p>    <p>      The house really shines in these interior details, which      reflect Sellers' commitment to bringing outside materials      indoors and remaining true to the natural beauty of the      surroundings.    </p>    <p>      For an elegant design solution, Sellers says, "Don't use      rocks if you don't have rocks on your site. Use what meets      the main criteria for value, which is based on perceived      appropriateness for the site." The happy result of such a      decision is that it leads you naturally to support the      local economy and craftspeople, who are adept at working      with native materials.    </p>    <p>      About one-third of the Tree House's vertical supports are      trees from the property. Because they are unsawn, their      inherent warmth, sound-absorption quality and strength are      preserved. None of the wood is stained, and some trees even      retain their bark.    </p>    <p>      "The logic of using a tree you have to cut down to clear      the site, instead of a milled 2-by-4 from a tree cut down      thousands of miles away, is that it adds flavor and      sculptural quality, and a connection to the local      environment that's impossible to get any other way,"      Sellers says.    </p>    <p>      The beauty of the majestic trees is deceptively simple. "To      remove the bark on some of the pillars, we had to hand peel      them and then clean them up with mallets," Moore says.      "They are all sealed with Verathane, a water-based      urethane. We put hot paraffin into the tree joints as      needed to slow drying and prevent splitting. But the trees      are shrinking a little bit, as we expected."    </p>    <p>      Sellers wanted the tree skeleton of the building to be      apparent, so that the lines could be visually traced      throughout the house. The big trees go from the upper      floors all the way through to the basement, making the      structure clear and understandable. "The elegance then      comes from simplicity, rather than a lot of elaborate,      decorative elements," he says. "The house is designed to      unfold as an experience. Upon entering, you walk down a      long hall through the 'muscles' of the trees lined up along      the hallway, with the main spaces opening up to your right      and the windows framed by big trees."    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMMON ' cents'</strong>    </p>    <p>      For many people, the choice of local building materials is      as much about their wallet as it is about aesthetics. In      the Tree House, much of the flooring, trim and door      material is beechwood because Vermont experienced a beech      blight in the late 1990s. The team salvaged some of those      dying trees and had them milled and dried. The beech      blended right in with the other materials. "Favoring local      timber sources over the more popular Western timber species      is akin to the growing popularity of microbreweries,"      Sellers says. "People want that local flavor."    </p>        <p>      Sellers experienced other similar good fortune. Looking for      trim to match the slate roof, he called several salvage      yards until he finally hit the jackpot. One had just      demolished an old school and had 50 old slate blackboards.      "I said, 'We'll take all of them!"' he says. To turn this      amazing find into workable trim, Sellers turned to the same      local expert-an experienced slate installer hailing      from a long line of slate men- who had applied the      slate roof.    </p>    <p>      The sauna building, with walls built entirely of these      recycled slate blackboards, was added as the final touch.      It has no foundation; to avoid disturbing the topsoil, the      crew drilled holes and inserted stainless steel pipes into      the bedrock for supports. "The building sits like a spider,      with pins locking it into the ground," Sellers says. "Water      can run undiverted under it."    </p>    <p>      Troy Osborne, a member of Sellers' firm, likens the      collaborative effort of architect, contractor and homeowner      to the process of making a film or performing in a jazz      group. "It's taking a unique concept, adding particular      players and seeing what comes of it," he says.    </p>    <p>      As the head of that ensemble, Sellers is pleased that      everything came together so pleasantly. "As an architect, I      can only argue my case for a short time-while I'm      working on the project. So in the end, the building must be      a self-evident statement about materials and design working      together that lasts after I walk away."    </p>    <p>      Reprinted from <em><span style="font-style:italic;">Natural Home</span></em> magazine <em>[      <a href="http://www.naturalhomemagazine.com" target="_blank">www.naturalhomemagazine.com</a> ;</em> (800) 340-5846].    </p>    <p>      <strong>Building Tips From the Architect</strong>    </p>    <p>      David Sellers offers these tips for any building or      remodeling project, including those on a tight budget:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Be a cheapskate</strong> . "Find local materials      that are free, and use them as you find them. This will      connect the house to the local landscape and save you      money. For example, the local beechwood used for flooring      in the Tree House, even after milling and drying, was still      cheaper than buying something like precut maple."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Splurge on the details</strong> . "Spend a decent      portion of your budget on a few special, stunning      details-perhaps the kitchen cabinets or the      handrailings. Employ skilled local craftspeople for those      projects."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Recruit local talent</strong> . Use your project's      exceptional elements to attract the attention of other      local talent. Through the work of many hands, it's possible      to turn your project into a community showpiece. "If you      make your building project something unique and special,      people will come out of the woodwork to give you a break      and be part of it, especially if it might add to their      portfolio of work and possible exposure." <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
