                <p>      Mother's Nature    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Terry Krautwurst    </h5>        <p>      Whoever came up with the expression "eats like a bird" to      describe someone with an eensy appetite never watched wild      birds in winter. Although feathers do a fine job of      insulating a small bird's body from cold, food is the fuel      that stokes its inner fires, keeping its metabolism      generating crucial heat and energy. From sunup to sundown,      an overwintering bird's focus in life is to feed its face.      Most small species need to eat from one-third to      three-fourths their body weight in food each day. No      gluttony here, though; the name of the game is survival,      pure and simple. No food, no tomorrow.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, at the same time wintry weather forces birds      to increase their caloric intake, it also reduces the      pickings-meals become hard to find. Gone are summer's      salad days, when tasty insects filled the air and leaves      were acrawl with plump larvae. Fall's harvest of ripened      seeds and berries has passed, too. What seeds remain are      covered by snow or thinly scattered to the winds; ice coats      tree buds and fruit.    </p>    <p>      Winter, in other words, is tough on birds. And this is      where we humans come in-not only to the birds'      benefit, but to ours as well. According to surveys, about      one-third of adults feed backyard birds, doling out roughly      500,000 tons of commercial birdseed a year, along with      countless quantities of suet cakes, seed logs and other      treats.    </p>    <p>      We do it partially to help the birds, of course. Although      most birds are able to forage successfully despite the      bleak and bone-chilling conditions, mere beak-to-mouth      survival does not an easy life make. Feeders enable birds      to find food faster and more easily than searching for tiny      weed seeds and bark-buried, semifrozen grubs. Less      searching may also mean less risk of predation.    </p>    <p>      But the truth is, we feed birds to nourish our own      winter-weary souls, too. Somehow watching birds flit from      feeder to bush to branch, to feeder to bush to branch,      lifts our spirits. Putting out feeders not only gives us a      closer look at our feathered friends, but also gives us a      greater sense of kinship with the creatures sharing our      natural world.    </p>    <p>      Here are some ways to help you, your family and your      backyard birds benefit more from winter bird feeding:    </p>    <p>      <strong>ADVERTISE</strong>    </p>    <p>      By the time winter rolls around, most birds already have      regular feeding routes they established in summer and fall.      In cold weather, they can't risk scouting for new sources.      So if you're setting feeders out for the first time or      putting one in a new location, you may need to "advertise"      to attract bird customers and gain their confidence. Put      out a temporary, open feeder first. Use a weathered piece      of plywood or board, perhaps with furring strips tacked      around the edges as a rim. Drill several holes for      drainage. Put the "ad" in the open where birds will see it,      but close to cover. It's best to set the board up off the      ground-on a tree stump, for instance, or anchored to      a limb.    </p>    <p>      Now sprinkle some birdseed and bits of white bread on the      tray. Birds sometimes hesitate to try store-bought seed,      but white bread (not wheat, not rye-only white) is a      sure-fire lure. Of course it's also nutritionally hollow,      so consider it strictly a grand-opening come-on.    </p>    <p>      You'll have to restock the tray every day or two because      the food is exposed to rain, wind and four-legged      critters-a disadvantage of using this kind of feeder      long-term. Fortunately, within a week or so you should have      plenty of regular customers. Then you can put out better      (roofed, watertight) feeders filled with more nutritious      food. Gradually cut back the rations on the tray (starting      with the bread), and the birds will switch to the feeders.    </p>        <p>      <strong>WATCH THE WEATHER</strong>    </p>    <p>      All things considered, winter birds are amazingly      resourceful, resilient survivors. Under most conditions      they'll get along just fine without human intervention.      This is not necessarily the case, however, in extremely      harsh weather. Severe storms, bitter high winds, long      periods of extreme cold and a host of other potentially      deadly variables from Mother Nature can take a significant      toll on bird populations. During these times, feeders may      be their <em>only</em> reliable, accessible food sources.      Try always to keep your feeders stocked, but make doubly      sure during periods of sleet, ice, snow or serious cold.    </p>    <p>      Put fresh water out daily, too, when temperatures stay      below freezing. If you have a birdbath, use a commercial      birdbath-heating element to keep the water from icing. Or      just make breaking any ice a morning ritual.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRACTICE CROWD</strong> <strong>AND PEST      CONTROL</strong>    </p>    <p>      To prevent overcrowding at your backyard diner while      attracting as many kinds of birds as possible, offer a      variety of seeds and treats in feeders located at different      levels and spaced sufficiently to give all comers a place      at the table. Be aware, however, that some birds will try      to monopolize your feeders. If large species such as      pigeons and blackbirds are scaring smaller songbirds away,      use perchless hanging feeders that won't support the      heavier callers. Or just toss bread or cracked corn on the      ground away from other feeders, to give the bullies their      own food.    </p>    <p>      Squirrels, of course, are infamous for their ability to get      into bird feeders. To discourage them, avoid hanging your      feeders from tree limbs and beneath eaves. Instead, mount      feeders on individual poles at least 6 feet off the ground      and beyond jumping distance (about 6 feet) from your roof      or surrounding trees.    </p>    <p>      I f squirrels become a problem at a tree-mounted feeder,      tack a 3-foot section of sheet metal around the trunk or      branch. Or invest in a commercial squirrel-proof feeder.      Most models are all-steel (squirrels easily chew through      plastic) and feature a weighted perch mechanism that allows      birds to dine but closes the food hopper when visited by      fat, furry four-leggers. If all else fails, try putting      feed out each day just 30 minutes before nightfall, when      squirrels already are bedded down but many birds are still      foraging.    </p>    <p>      Diseases such as salmonella can spread at bird feeders.      Clean your feeders at least once a year-some experts      say once a month is not too often. Use a stiff brush to      scrub feeders thoroughly with a 10 percent bleach solution      (one part bleach to nine parts warm water), then rinse them      well and wipe them dry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THINK NUTRITION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Not all birdseed is created equal, and not all birds like      all birdseed. Supermarket mixtures are often heavy on      low-nutrient, lowdemand seeds such as milo. Instead, buy      individual types in bulk and mix your own. Or offer      different kinds in different feeders.    </p>    <p>      Black oil-type sunflower and white proso millet will      attract nearly all kinds of seed-eating backyard birds and      are by far the most popular with the widest variety of      species. Use them in most of your feeders, then add some      variety with nutritious but more species-specific fare.      Niger thistle appeals especially to pine siskins,      goldfinches, and purple and house finches. Peanut kernels      are ambrosia to the tufted titmouse. Jays and cardinals      enjoy munching into black-stripe sunflower seeds. Cracked      corn is a favorite of mourning doves, grackles and juncos.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUET'LL DO IT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most birds eat insects as well as seeds. In winter, suet      (raw fat) serves as an important high-calorie substitute      for summer's six-legged protein. Woodpeckers, flickers,      chickadees and nuthatches are among the many species that      benefit from it. Chunks of hard, unstringy beef suet are      best. Just hang some outside in a plastic mesh bag or      wire-mesh suet holder. It'll be eaten long before it      spoils. Or if you prefer, pack softened suet into pine or      hemlock cones and tie the cones to tree branches. Or better      yet, stuff the cones with this high-fat, high-protein      recipe: Combine 2 cups of warm, melted suet with 1 cup each      of yellow cornmeal and peanut butter. Cool, stuff and      serve.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DON'T FORGET THE GRIT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Grit is essential in most birds' diets, both as an aid to      digestion and as a source of minerals. Birds usually get      all they need from sand, tiny pebbles and such, but snow      cover can make grit tough to find. (That's why you      sometimes see birds in winter pecking at asphalt roof      shingles.) To help, put out a small dish of coarse      sand-preferably seashore sand, which contains      calcium-rich shell and high-mineral quartz. Chicken egg      shells, dried and crushed, also are a good source of grit      and calcium. Add them to whatever birdseed or suet mixtures      you use.    </p>        <p>      <strong>OFFER TREATS, TOO</strong>    </p>    <p>      Birds needn't live by birdseed alone. Offer treats      occasionally, too. Crackers, doughnuts, raisin bread,      cooked sweet potato, baked beans, dry pet chow and cut      pieces of fruit-apples, bananas, pears,      plums-are popular snacks at backyard feeders. Grape      and apple jellies are favored by overwintering warblers and      make good cold-weather food because they don't freeze.      Coconut meat is a favorite of woodpeckers, chickadees and      titmice. Just crack open a nut and hang the pieces from      branches. (Don't serve dry shredded coconut, because it      swells after being swallowed. And straight peanut butter      can be too sticky for small species to manage.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANT LIVING FEEDERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Feeding birds commercial birdseed helps them through harsh      winter conditions, but it's no substitute for improving      backyard habitat. In spring and fall, plant a variety of      trees, shrubs and other vegetation that not only serve up      food such as buds and berries but also provide shelter and      nesting sites. Holly, winterberry, cotoneaster and many      other food-bearers yield nutritious fare that's more      appealing to a wider variety of birds than commercial food.      Nurseries and garden centers can help you choose the      "living bird feeders" that grow best in your area.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ENJOY THE SHOW</strong>    </p>    <p>      Hey, winter's a tough time for humans, too. Fortunately, we      have our feathered friends to help. Watching their cheerful      antics as they come and go at your feeders definitely puts      a brighter face on the season. Be sure to take time each      day to snuggle up in a cozy chair near a window and enjoy      the show.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
