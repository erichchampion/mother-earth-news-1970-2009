                <p>      Green Gazette    </p>        		 <p>      The Climate Stewardship Act didn't make it through Congress      last fall, but the environment may still prove the winner.      The first attempt by Congress to address the threat of      global warming since 1998, the McCain-Lieberman Climate      Stewardship Act, failed to pass the Senate by a narrow      margin, but Sen. John McCain says he may reintroduce the      legislation as early as this spring.    </p>    <p>      McCain and the bill's co-sponsor, Sen. Joe Lieberman,      D-Connecticut, say they are encouraged by the support the      failed bill received; the vote was a close 43-55. "We lost      a battle today," McCain said, "but we'll win over time      because climate change is real. And we will overcome the      influence of special interests over time."    </p>    <p>      The Climate Stewardship Act would cap carbon dioxide (C0 2      ) emissions from power plants, oil companies and factories,      and create an emissions trading system under which      companies that achieve more pollution reductions than      required can sell their excess reductions to other      companies to help them meet their commitments.    </p>    <p>      The aim of the legislation is to begin solving the problem      of global warming, which poses a wide range of threats to      the environment, the economy and public health. Carbon      dioxide, produced by the combustion of coal, oil and      natural gas, is the most abundant of the green house gases,      which are responsible for raising the Earth's surface      temperature. Scientists predict global warming will cause      species extinctions, rising sea levels, an increase in      deaths from extreme heat, and the migration of tropical      diseases northward.    </p>    <p>      Kevin Curtis, National Environmental Trust vice president      of government affairs and a supporter of the      McCain-Lieberman legislation, says three weeks before the      October vote, the bill reportedly only had 32 votes firmly      supporting it and more than a dozen senators still on the      fence. "Our fear was that the bill might pull in fewer than      40 votes," he says, which would have doomed it for the      foreseeable future. "But the majority of the undecided      senators broke in favor of the bill."    </p>    <p>      According to information from McCain's office, a      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study estimated      the legislation would cost only about $20 per household.      Analysts predicted the impact on the U.S. GNP at no more      than 0.01 percent. A second study by the Boston-based      Thellus Institute predicted that if the bill becomes law,      it will reduce U.S. energy demands and save U.S. residents      $48 billion by 2020.    </p>    <p>      [SOURCES: AMANDA GRISCOM AND GRIST MAGAZINE (SUBSCRIBE TO      GRIST'S FREE E-MAIL AT WWW.GRISTMAGAZINE.COM/SIGNUP ); SEN.      JOHN MCCAIN AND SEN. JOE LIEBERMAN, AND THE NATIONAL      WILDLIFE FEDERATION ( WWW.NWF.ORG )]    </p>    <p>      Northeast Crafts Plan to Cut Carbon Emissions    </p>    <p>      The northeastern United States isn't waiting for Congress      to tackle the problem of global warming. The governors of      10 states, led by New York Gov. George Pataki, agreed last      July to begin a regional initiative to curb carbon dioxide      (C0 2 ) emissions. Their goal is to establish a flexible,      market-based cap and trade program by April 2005.    </p>    <p>      Pataki and the governors of Connecticut, Vermont, New      Hampshire, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,      Massachusetts and Rhode Island agreed to develop a regional      C0 2 cap and trade program in an effort to reduce C0 2      emissions from power plants. Maryland has indicated it may      participate in the discussions at a later date.    </p>    <p>      The plan would center on an emissions trading system to      require power generators to reduce emissions. The      initiative grew out of recommendations made to Pataki by      the Greenhouse Gas Task Force he appointed in June 2001 (      www.ccap.org ).    </p>    <p>      James Tripp, general counsel for Environmental Defense, a      national environmental advocacy organization, and a member      of the Greenhouse Gas Task Force, Says, "This is not only a      major regional initiative but a critical national precedent      as to how to deal with global warming."    </p>    <p>      Ashok Gupta, director of the Air and Energy Program for the      National Resources Defense Council, says, "The debate in      the Northeast is no longer about climate science but how      best to use existing technologies to reduce emissions and      minimize energy costs at the same time."    </p>    <p>      [SOURCE: ENVIRONMENT NEWS SERVICE (ENS),      WWW.ENS-NEWSWIRE.COM ]    </p>    <p>      Cleaner Power to the People    </p>    		 <p>      If you hate writing checks to pay for energy that comes      from a fossil-fuel-chugging power plant, you may have      another option at your command. A new industry has emerged      in recent years that allows customers to buy power      generated by renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar,      geothermal and biomass.    </p>    <p>      The electricity currently used in the United States comes      primarily from coal (52 percent), nu clear (20 percent) and      natural gas (16 percent). Ten percent comes from hydropower      and oil combined, while only 2 percent originates from      renewable sources. The environmental repercussions of this      imbalance are considerable.    </p>    <p>      According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA), electricity generation is responsible for two-thirds      of the sulfur dioxide, one-third of the mercury and      one-quarter of the nitrogen oxides emitted annually in the      United States. In addition, use of fossil-fuel-based energy      sources contributes significantly to emissions of fine      particulate matter and carbon dioxide, a leading greenhouse      gas.    </p>    <p>      About 50 percent of U.S. electricity customers today have      the option of purchasing green power directly from their      suppliers. More than 400,000 actually are doing it.    </p>    <p>      The number of suppliers who offer green pricing options or      who are in the process of developing such programs has      grown to more than 350 utilities in 33 states. Included are      investor-owned utilities, rural electric cooperatives and      other publicly owned utilities. Green pricing is a separate      tariff designed specifically for the utility to sell green      power. In states with restructured electricity markets,      electricity customers often can choose from multiple      suppliers, some of which may offer green power programs,      too.    </p>    <p>      Even if your local utility does not offer green power      options, you still can purchase cleaner power from      regionally or nationally based companies that offer      "renewable energy certificates." These certificates      represent electricity generated from renewable energy      sources. The physical electricity is sold into the regional      market where the power is generated, but the certificates      can be sold anywhere in the country, or the world for that      matter. <em>(Here at</em> <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> <em>, for      example, we offset our energy use with green power      certificates purchased from</em> Native Energy <em>, a      windpower supplier that focuses on developing American      Indian renewable energy projects.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Renewable energy sources still are a bit more expensive      than conventional sources, but the price most of us pay for      electricity does not account for the environmental damage      and other external costs associated with the use of fossil      and nuclear fuels. We eventually pay for these hidden costs      in the form of tax dollars spent on regulations, pollution      control and increased health-care costs linked to air      pollution.    </p>    <p>      But how do you know that the premium you are paying is      actually supporting renewable energy development? As a      consumer, you have a right to ask what assurances your      green power provider can provide. Some certification      programs exist: Green-e and the Green Pricing Accreditation      Program, both administered by the Center for Resource      Solutions, are leading national certification programs for      green power.    </p>    <p>      <strong>For More Information:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Utility Green Pricing Programs<br />      www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/summary.shtml    </p>    <p>      Green Power Product Offerings in States with Competitive      Retail Markets      www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/mkt_summ.shtml    </p>    <p>      Renewable Energy Certificate offerings<br />      www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/certif_summ.shtml    </p>    <p>      So, paying a premium for green electricity now will save      all of us money later. And, in comparison to other      household expenditures, green power isn't <em>that</em>      costly either-only about $17 more per month for an      average household. Other benefits also may exist: Green      power customers sometimes are treated to special events or      discounts at local businesses, and a limited number of      utilities offer a fixed utility rate that protects green      power customers from fluctuations in fuel costs.    </p>    <p>      (SOURCE: BLAIR SWEZEY AND LORI BIRD, NATIONAL RENEWABLE      ENERGY LABORATO RY, GOLDEN, COLORADO, AND SOLAR TODAY      MAGAZINE ( WWW.SOLARTODAY.ORG )]    </p>    <p>      Lessons in Living a Farmer's Life    </p>    			<p>      Now's the time to sign up for summer learn-to-farm      internships and apprenticeships. If you're a city slicker      stricken with the farming "bug" or a student in search of a      meaningful summer experience, you'll find lots of      opportunities to learn the basics on organic farms across      the country and internationally. Here are some resources to      check out:    </p>    <p>      The National Center for Appropriate Technology's ATTRA      (Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas) program      compiles an extensive listing of internships and      apprenticeships on organic farms, in intentional      communities and with associated organizations in the United      States and Canada. Check out ATTRA's Sustainable Farming      Resource List at www.attra.ncat.org .    </p>    <p>      The Farm School in Athol, Massachusetts, offers in-depth      farm training courses, as well as summer activities for      young people. Class schedules are listed at      www.farmschool.org .    </p>    <p>      World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms ( www.wwoof.org )      maintains a list of potential international positions,      which you can access after joining the organization. These      resources are great starting points, but remember to      thoroughly research any position before you sign up.    </p>    <p>      Decipher those Food Codes    </p>        <p>      Some labels on food products tell us about the item's      nutrient content. Other labels carry important information,      too - in industry codes that consumers don't always      understand. But for shoppers dedicated to knowing how their      food was produced, such labels promise to be increasingly      useful in the future.    </p>    <p>      Most fresh produce, for example, carries a label with a      four-digit price look-up (PLU) code; "4011," for example,      appears on conventional bananas. According to Alicia      Calhoun, technology and standards manager for the Produce      Marketing Association, if the produce is organically grown,      a "9" precedes that code, making organic bananas "94011."      In the future, she says, if genetically modified whole      produce is introduced to the marketplace, it will be      identified with an "8" in place of the "9."    </p>    <p>      In September, another sort of food label, a      country-of-origin label (called "COOL"), will begin to      appear on some foods because of an amendment to the 2002      Farm Bill. Fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables, beef,      pork, lamb, seafood and peanuts are affected.    </p>    <p>      However, a House of Representatives committee temporarily      halted funding for country-of-origin labels on meats last      fall, and other initiatives may delay funding for parts of      the program for a time. The debate over when to implement      COOL was prompted because some food manufacturers and      retailers have concerns about cost and complexity, and the      amount of time needed to properly implement the program.    </p>    <p>      The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Marketing      Service (AMS) is responsible for overseeing that      implementation. According to Kathryn Mattingly of the AMS,      the USDA does expect the COOL produce program to be      implemented, and even if a partial delay is OK'd by      Congress, wild and farm-raised fish will carry COOL labels      by September. Mattingly says COOL does not apply to      farmer's markets, farm stands or small businesses.    </p>    <p>      Visit www.ams.usda.gov/cool for more details.    </p>    <p>      sprouts& snippets    </p>    <p>      <strong>Yosemite Goes for Biodiesel.</strong> A biodiesel      production facility is being built at Yosemite National      Park. Delaware North Parks and Resorts, Yosemite's official      concessionaire, says the facility will recycle used cooking      oil from park restaurants into biodiesel that, in turn,      will fuel park vehicles. Delaware North estimates the park      will repay its investment in the project in less than four      years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Eco-sleuths in Training.</strong> The University of      Wales, Bangor, North Wales, in the United Kingdom, is      training a new generation of environmental sleuths.      Although the field of environmental forensics originated in      the United States, the University of Wales is the first in      the world to offer a course in the subject. Students study      chemistry, biology and geology, and prepare themselves to      give testimony in court cases involving pollution problems      and the assignment of responsibility for clean-up costs.      Stephen Mudge, course organizer, says ', students learn a      logical approach to their science, including unbiased      observation and record keeping.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Test Your Water at Home.</strong> If you're      concerned about the water quality in or around your      homestead, you can analyze it with an inexpensive home      water test kit. Usually costing less than $20, these kits      detect lead, pesticides, chlorine, nitrates and bacteria.      Rhonda Janke, a Kansas State University researcher, tested      the accuracy of home water test kits: Those from Watersafe,      Hach, CHEMetrics and 3M gave accurate results. Such home      testing kits are more affordable than sending samples to a      lab, but should only serve as a starting point. "They are      like a preliminary screening at the doctor's," Janke says.      "If the home test indicates traces of a contaminant, you      probably want to send your samples to a lab."    </p>    <p>      Except where noted, Green Gazette is written by Lindsey      Hodel.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
