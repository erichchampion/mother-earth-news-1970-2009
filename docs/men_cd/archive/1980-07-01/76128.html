                    <p>      <strong>KUDOS FOR KUDZU!</strong> NASA biochemist Dr. B.C.      Wolverton has shown that one cubic foot of dried kudzu can      produce as much as four to five cubic feet of methane gas.      Furthermore, he estimates that a home energy system using      kudzu (grown under careful control) and the waste bacteria      from the family sewage could produce a year's supply of      energy for the household . . . including enough methane to      run a car for 113,000 miles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"I'LL GO ON AHEAD AND SCOUT OUT THE      TRAIL":</strong> When, during last year's crisis, a member      of the board of supervisors of Newbury Township which is      located a scant two miles from the Three Mile Island      nuclear plant called the township's civil defense director      for help in mapping out an evacuation plan for area      residents, he found that the CD coordinator was already      long gone!    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE NATIONAL SOLAR ENERGY EDUCATION      DIRECTORY</strong> (Second Edition), which lists 1,760      solar related courses and 240 programs and curricula      offered at over 780 post-secondary educational institutions      in the U.S., is now available-for $5.50 postpaid-from the      Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing      Office, Washington, D.C. 80408.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A BIT MUCH!</strong> A billion tons of rock and      residue-as much as was excavated in the construction of the      Panama Canal would have to be moved, each year, in order to      produce a million barrels a day of shale-based oil. (We      currently import over eight million barrels of oil a day.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>PHANTOM TAXES:</strong> The Environmental Action      Foundation points out that customers of the nation's 100      largest private power firms were "legally" charged for over      $3.8 billion in federal income taxes in 1978, yet the      utilities actually paid less than $800 million in income      taxes to the government. In fact, 89 power companies-that      charged their customers as if the utilities had paid a $698      million tax bill-actually paid no federal income tax at      all!    </p>    <p>      <strong>UP IN SMOKE!</strong> Ten to 18 billion pounds of      excess ethylene products, which could serve as feedstock      for alcohol feels, are presently emitted from the nation's      petroleum refinery stacks each year. These materials could      produce an annual yield of as much as six billion gallons      of ethanol.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE NEW RIVER CONTROVERSY</strong> , a book by      Thomas d. Schoenbaum, chronicles the dramatic 11-year      battle to save the New River (which is the second oldest      river on earth), from being dammed by the Appalachian Power      Company. In this saga (available from John F. Blair,      Publisher, Dept. TMEN, 1406 Plaza Drive, Winston-Salem,      North Carolina 27103 for $12.95, plus 81d postage) the good      guys win.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTIN' SMART:</strong> Potsdam, New York's      Clarkson College will become the first U.S. educational      institution to convert its oil-fueled system to a      woodburning setup. By using wood chips, sawdust, and other      waste from three area sawmills, Clarkson officials expect      to save at least $1?5,000 a year in operational costs!    </p>    <p>      <strong>OIL BLACKMAIL?</strong> After the U.S. and Israel      expressed reservations about France's agreement to ship      weapons grade uranium to an atomic research center in Iraq,      French officials decided to deliver a 10% enriched fuel      that can't be used to make weapons instead. But Iraq, which      is France's second-largest oil supplier, refused to accept      the "safe" fuel and forced France to deliver the contracte      for 90% enriched uranium.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PIGEON POST:</strong> The birds now carry blood      samples-from a hospital in Plymouth, England-for lab      analysis in Devonport several miles away . . , saving      thousands of gallons of gasoline a year. What's more,      "pigeon power" gets the samples delivered about three times      faster than did the old car-and-road method.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LET THE SUN SHINE IN!</strong> Forty-five inmates      of Georgia prisons are being trained in the basics of solar      energy, using a Georgia Tech curriculum. Besides teaching      work skills to the prisoners, the Georgia Department of      Offender Rehabilitation hopes that applications derived      from the program will cut energy consumption in half at      several of its correctional institutions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MIRING METHANE:</strong> The Public Service      Electric & Gas Co. of New Jersey now "mines" garbage      dumps to bring in 830,000 cubic feet of methane a day, and      will soon increase its output to one million cubic feet a      day .... Starting next year, the Pennsylvania Power and      Light Co. <strong>WILL REFUSE SERVICE</strong> to new homes      or commercial buildings-in 89 specific counties that don't      meet preset insulation standards .... The "Efficiency II"      water heating heat pump can, its manufacturer claims, SAVE      YOU $150 OR MORE A YEAR. Write E-Tech, Inc., Dept. TMEN,      3570 American Drive, Atlanta, Georgia 30341 for details      .... New York University researchers are processing      newspapers and sawdust, under heat and pressure, to create      a rich high-glucose syrup that's <strong>IDEAL FOR THE      MANUFACTURE OF ALCOHOL ....</strong> The nuclear industry      is attempting to gain support for <strong>"THE NUCLEAR      WASTE POLICY ACT</strong> ", a bill that would eliminate      any industry responsibility for the controversial question      of radioactive waste disposal and throw the problem ail on      the shoulders of the government (i.e., the taxpayers) . . .      . Meanwhile, U.S. nuclear power plants reported 2,83S      "INCIDENTS" IN 1978 . . . . We spend more for foreign oil      ($90 billion a year) THAN <strong>THE TOTAL NET ASSETS OF      GENERAL MOTORS, FORD, IBM, AND GENERAL ELECTRIC.</strong>    </p>
