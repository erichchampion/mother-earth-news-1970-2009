    <p>
                        <p>      I'm the sort of person who seldom leaves a stone unturned .      . . because I've found that rocks contain a great deal of      history as well as profit potential in the form of valuable      fossils.    </p>    <p>      In the creek bed near my house, for example, I've      discovered sandwiched between layers of gray shale hundreds      of specimens of a certain species of trilobite (      <em>Ampyxina bellatula</em> ). Many of the preserved      creatures now grace shelves in my home . . . and I've sold      my extras to dealers, for $5.00 each!    </p>    <h3>      WHAT TO LOOK FOR    </h3>    <p>      Fossils can be the petrified remains or impressions of      entire animals or of their bony parts, skin, feathers, or      tracks . . . in short, the term is used to describe almost      all bits of evidence that indicate the presence or passing      of creatures long ago. Among the most interesting (and most      valuable to collectors and museums) of such preserved      beasts are the trilobites, which ruled the oceans some 500      million years back, and ranged in size from less than an      inch in length to 18 inches or more. Though such life forms      haven't been around for about 230 million years, their      fossilized remains are commonly found all over the country      . . . often exquisitely preserved and showing all their      original detail.    </p>    <p>      Trilobites are not, of course, the only fossil "game in      town". A local rock shop owner pays me $4.00 each for      preserved segments of a straight cephalopod a shelled      forefather of the squid and octopus that lived in Missouri      some 400 million years ago. Another large and perfect      cephalopod specimen (which is worth several hundred      dollars) takes up three feet of floor space in my study.    </p>    <h3>      WHERE TO LOOK    </h3>    <p>      Fossils can be found almost everywhere. Each hillside,      quarry, road cut, outcrop, and stream bed is a potential      "mine". Even the rocks in your field or garden may contain      some of the time travelers. Certainly, though, the more you      know about fossils and the geological formations in which      they're likely to be located, the more specimens you'll be      able to find.    </p>        <p>      The best" hunting ground" is sedimentary rock that was laid      down under a prehistoric body of water and is      characteristically (and usually recognizably) layered. Many      of the organisms that lived in the lake, pond, or sea will      be preserved within the solidified sediment . . .      particularly if they had hard parts such as shells,      carapaces, or bones. The creatures will have "survived" the      millions of years since their deaths as impressions (molds      or casts), or will perhaps have been partially or wholly      replaced by dissolved minerals. Since organic matter often      disintegrates very slowly, such replacement can sometimes      create an exact replica in stone . . . even down to the      animal or plant's cellular level. Occasionally (though      rarely), some of the ancient life form's original organic      matter may survive as well.    </p>    <p>      The fortunate fossil forager will find his specimens      "weathered out" on the exterior of rocks. More often,      however, it will be necessary to split the strata in your      search (but there's certainly no need to dig ugly holes in      the landscape in order to make finds). Securely embedded      specimens should, of course, be extracted with care, but      since erosion would eventually wear away the unprotected      mineralized organisms, anyway prospective hunters shouldn't      feel guilty about collecting and preserving them, if they      do the job properly and with a minimum of disruption.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that fossils are usually near (if not      within) what was once the creatures' natural habitat,      and-since ecological communities always support a variety      of life the discovery of one preserved organism will      suggest the presence of others.    </p>    <p>      You may find the identification of different species      difficult at first, but the search for knowledge in this      area is actually a great part of the pleasure of collecting      fossils. To educate yourself, however, it's necessary to      keep an exact record of where and at what depth each      individual specimen is found. (See the accompanying sidebar      for identification sources and markets for your finds.)    </p>    <h3>      TOP TREASURES    </h3>    <p>      The following are the most popular and therefore the most      valuable fossils among the commonly found varieties.    </p>    <p>      TRILOBITES look like fat insects and are commonly one to      four inches in length. There are variations on the basic      model, but if you have a clear mental picture of one type      of trilobite, you'll recognize them all. The heads      (cephalons), segmented middles (thoraxes), and tails      (pygidia) are often found separately, since the creatures      shed their shells to accommodate growth just as do      crustaceans (crabs and lobsters, etc.) today. Usually,      however, only whole specimens are prized . . . and species,      size, rarity, and the state of preservation will dictate a      fossil's value. (The "take" can be as little as the $3.00      to $5.00 that my relatively common <em>Ampyxina</em> will      bring . . . or as much as the $300 recently offered a      friend of mine for a perfect four-inch <em>Isotelus.</em> )    </p>    <p>      <em>CEPHALOPODS</em> have large, cylindrical shells that      are either straight or coiled. (In the latter types, the      coil is flat and is, therefore, distinguishable from those      of the more common snail fossils . . . which tend to be      somewhat spiral.) Cephalopods (a group which includes      ammonites, nautiloids, and straight cephalopods) often have      delicately ornate markings and ridges, and are among the      most spectacular of ancient creatures. Their shells can      range from a few inches to several feet in diameter or      length. In life, these members of the mollusk family      sported tentacles. They reached their zenith at the time of      the dinosaurs, and very few species still survive.    </p>    <p>      <em>CRINOIDS</em> are flower-like sea animals that have      stems, heads, and arms. Stem sections are extremely common      and virtually valueless to the collector . . . but an      intact, whole crinoid (I found one last week in a roadc-ut)      will bring $80 or more. Occasionally, when found on a slab      in groups, they are all but priceless.    </p>    <p>      <em>SHELLS</em> of various kinds are very common and, as a      result, are difficult to sell. Some dealers will pay a      little for groups of 100 or more, but the effort of      collecting so many separate specimens is hardly worth the      return. Such mundane fossils are, however, indicators of      ancient marine communities which may also have supported      trilobites, cephalopods, and crinoids . . . and some of the      larger brachiopod shells are worth adding to your own      collection simply for their beauty.    </p>    <p>      Other fossils which are common only in specific locations      around the country may include fish skeletons, insects,      animal and bird tracks, leaves, petrified wood, sharks'      teeth . . . and even reptile remains, although collecting      the latter "finds" is a process best left to professional      paleontologists (such valuable relics are too easily      damaged to be safely handled by amateurs).    </p>        <h3>      FROM PASTIME TO AVOCATION    </h3>    <p>      The more exotic fossils, of course, are especially      difficult to locate, but they're around. As ( <em>and</em>      if) you progress from the casual overturning of rocks to a      strong desire for more specific knowledge, your state's      geological survey can provide maps and data on the age and      identification of the native sedimentary strata. (Some such      agencies will even offer information on actual collecting      areas and the types of fossils likely to be found there.    </p>    <p>      Local rock shops (they'll be listed in the Yellow Pages)      are also good sources of information, as are the somewhat      rare experienced collectors who don't mind revealing their      own hunting sites. Such people will often buy specimens,      too, as well as aid you in learning identification and      methods of cleaning and matrix (or surrounding rock)      removal. (Though most of the fossils you'll find will be      sufficiently exposed by natural erosion, the techniques for      any necessary cleaning are best learned locally, because      rock types and appropriate cleansing methods vary from      place to place.)    </p>    <p>      As a pricing guide, I use the Geological Enterprises      catalog, which can be ordered for $3.00 from Dept. TMEN,      Box 998, Ardmore, Oklahoma 73401. For fossils that will be      resold, I quote half the price listed for similar      specimens. When selling to collectors, though, I try not      always successfully to get the full price.    </p>    <p>      Before embarking on any substantial hunting expedition,      it's worth your while to check local laws. A few states      prohibit fossil collecting on some if not all public      property. (Utah, for example, does so.) It's always a good      idea, too, to ask permission from local landowners before      trespassing on their turf.    </p>    <p>      Then, as you gather your rock-bound treasures, keep in mind      that fossil hunting by careful and aware amateur      paleontologists has made significant contri butions to our      total knowledge of archaic life forms and the geological      history which they record. On a more personal level, my      profitable hobby adds a whole j new perspective to my life      . . . because each fossil that I find gives me access to a      moment of almost inconceivable antiquity, which in turn      leads to thoughts about time, space, the universe, and my      own peculiar place in the scheme of things. I know of no      other way of being quite so overwhelmed.    </p>    <h3>      RESOURCES FOR FOSSIL HUNTERS    </h3>    <p>      <strong>IDENTIFICATION SOURCES</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Index Fossils of North America</em> by Harvey W.
