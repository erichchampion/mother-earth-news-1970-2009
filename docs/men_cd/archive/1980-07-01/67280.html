                    <p>      <strong>You can whip up some down-home</strong>      <strong><em>(and</em> yummy!) entertainment right in your      own back yard!</strong>    </p>        <p>      Summer-with its sweltering temperatures and long, lazy      evenings-is the perfect time for an old-fashioned ice cream      party. And, since you'd probably prefer to avoid all the      "stiffeners" and preservatives that are routinely dumped      into the store-bought frozen confection, you ought to      consider dusting off your old handturned freezer (or buying      yourself a new one) and cranking out a natural, delicious      treat for the whole family to enjoy.    </p>    <p>      Home-churned ice cream isn't nearly as hard to make as      folks who've never tried it might expect . . . in fact,      it's downright easyand fun-to get a picnic-full of people      involved in cranking and freezing the mixture. Later, when      the creamy dessert is finished, you'll experience the      satisfaction of sidestepping the technological age and      making a completely natural product with nothing more than      healthful ingredients and good of muscle power . . . and      you'll savor an unforgettable taste treat as the chilly      delight slides down your throat!    </p>    <h3>      CHOOSING A FREEZER    </h3>    <p>      The first step in fixing home-churned ice cream is to buy a      good, dependable freezer (if you don't have one on hand)      from among the few models that are still commercially      available. So-to help you make your choiceMOTHER took a      look at two representative brands, one made by White      Mountain and the other by Richmond Cedar Works.    </p>    <p>      Both of these machines have tubs made of wood, which is a      better material than plastic for this purpose . . . since      timber is a superior insulator and will better contain the      cold-produced by the melting iceinside the freezer.    </p>        <p>      We ordered our ice cream makers from the Cumberland General      Store (Dept. TMEN, Route 3, Box 479, Crossville, Tennessee      38555), but you can probably also find the same models at      retail outletssuch as Sears, Roebuck and Co.--for a few      dollars less than the mail order price.    </p>    <p>      If you're in the market for the "old mas ter" of ice cream      freezers, you should certainly consider the classic White      Mountain ... it's a real beauty! Manufactured by White      Mountain Freezer, Inc. of Winchendon, Massachusetts, the      four-quart model (which we examined) has a thick wooden      bucket and a solid cast-metal gear frame and crank.    </p>        <p>      Built to last through generations of use, the White      Mountain freezer features a unique double-gear action, by      which steel spur gears drive the can and the dasher in      opposite directions. Quality craftsmanship is evident in      every part of the device: The twotiered steel "mixer" is      fitted with adjustable hardwood scrapers . . . the tall,      heavy can has rolled seams which are carefully soldered      along the inside edge ... and the stud which holds the can      in place on the pivot in the floor of the tub is a separate      piece that is joined to the steel bottom of the can.    </p>    <p>      The White Mountain four-quart freezer sells for $64.95      (when ordered from Cum Berland), but its combination of      thoughtful engineering, careful construction, and sheer      good looks makes this machine a real heirloom . . . a tool      that your family can use and enjoy for generations to come.    </p>    <p>      The Richmond Cedar Works ice cream maker (made by RCW      Manufacturing Corporation of Danville, Virginia) can't      match the superior quality of the White Mountain model,      but-at $29.95 for the five-quart sizeit's a moderately      priced (and very functional) alternative to the more      expensive freezer.    </p>    <p>      Most of this model's components are made of thermoplastic,      with the exception of the wooden tub (which is considerably      thinner than is the White Mountain bucket) and the      tin-plated steel can. The freezer's plastic gear assembly      has the more common singleaction gearing . . . whereby only      the can is revolved, while the paddle remains stationary.      The gear assembly fits loosely onto the can lid . . . and      there is a fair amount of drag as the handle is turned      (even when the machine is empty).    </p>    <p>      The inner can used in the Richmond Cedar Works freezer has      a handy fill line to indicate how much mix should be poured      in . . . but the seams on our unit's metal container were      somewhat sloppily soldered and could result in some leakage      (though we didn't note any). The can rest -which consists      of a bump protruding from the vessel's bottom-fits snugly      into a hollow in a plastic lug set into the freezer's      particle board base.    </p>    <p>      A Richmond Cedar Works ice cream churn certainly isn't in      the same league as the "luxury" White Mountain appliance,      but the less expensive model-despite its minor faultsis a      good, dependable product . . . and it may be the ideal      choice for a newcomer to the world of do-it-yourself ice      cream making.    </p>    <h3>      PREPARING TO FREEZE    </h3>    <p>      Once you've chosen your freezer and brought it home, your      next step should be to wash the new machine. Since the      cream and milk used in making a frozen dessert can breed      bacteria rapidly, hygiene has to be of primary concern to      any backyard ice cream chef. Before each use you should      thoroughly wash the freezer can, lid, <em>and</em> dasher      in hot, soapy water. Rinse the parts well and let them air      dry, then cool them-in your 'fridge-for about 30 minutes      <em>...</em> because the cream will freeze much faster in a      cold container.    </p>    <p>      Next, pour the chilled mixture-made from either your      favorite recipe or one of the formulas that accompany this      article-into the can . . . making sure that the vessel is      no more than 2/3 full. (You must allow some room for      expansion, as air seeps into the substance while it's      freezing.) Balance the container in position in the bottom      of the .tub, secure the dasher inside the can, and put the      lid in place.    </p>    <h3>      PACKING IT IN    </h3>    <p>      At this point, the device is ready to be filled with its      freezing agents . . . crushed ice and rock salt. You'll      want to use ice that's crushed as <em>fine as</em>      possible, since smaller pieces will melt more evenly      <em>...</em> producing a stable freezing process and giving      your end product a smoother texture. Start by distributing      ice all around the bottom of the tub-to a depth of about      two inches-- and follow that with a layer of rock salt-      (The coarse substance is generally available in      supermarkets, but if you can't find it-or if you run short      during the freezing operation-regular table salt is an      acceptable, though costly, substitute.)    </p>    <p>      The amount of salt you use in your freezer will be the main      factor in determining the consistency of the ice cream you      make. Too little salt-which will tend to slow up the      freezing time and force you to crank longerwill produce a      grainy end product ... while too much salt-which will speed      up the freezing process-will give the ice cream a spongy,      coarse texture. So, when packing in the layers of ice and      salt, you should always stick to the proportion of 4 parts      ice to 1 part salt (or one cup of ice to 114 cup of salt).      You'll find that such a combination produces a smooth,      fluffy dessert every time.    </p>    <p>      Continue alternating layers of ice and salt until the can      is totally surrounded (but not covered). Then attach the      gear drive and crank to the lid of the can . . . and start      the of machine turning! As you rotate the handle, the can      revolves inside the tub . . . while the action of the salt      melting the ice gradually freezes the cream mixture. Make      sure that the small hole in the side of the bucket remains      unclogged throughout the procedure, so that the brine      solution can drain off freely. And-as the ice continues to      melt-you'll need to add more layers of ice and salt ...      always maintaining the 4-to-1 ratio.    </p>    <h3>      THE HARD PART...<em>AND</em> THE REWARD    </h3>    <p>      After you've been turning the handle for a few minutes, the      cream will begin to harden ... and the task of cranking      will, from then on, get progressively more difficult. It's      a good idea-as you tire of the job-to send in the "relief      shift" and put a new set of muscles to work. And-since the      bucket will tend to "walk" as the dasher encounters more      resistance-it might also be helpful to have a second person      hold the tub (or even sit on top of the gear mechanism) to      help stabilize the freezer.    </p>    <p>      The crank should become virtually impossible to turn after      about 18 to 20 min utes ... and that means your summertime      treat is finally ready! Remove the gear and handle piece,      wipe off the lid, and open the can. If you've added the      right amounts of ice and salt while continually turning the      handle at a steady tempo, you should find a creamy, smooth      confection just waiting to be consumed!    </p>    <p>      Remove the dasher and hand it over to the crankers (it's      traditional to offer that piece to the hard workers, since      it reportedly holds the tastiest part of the frozen      delight). Then pack down the rest of the ice cream with a      long-handled spoon and dish it out to your hungry crowd!    </p>    <h3>      PRESERVING THE PRODUCT    </h3>    <p>      It's doubtful that any of the tasty dessert will be left      over after the first round or two of servings, but if you      should <em>happen</em> to have a bit of ice cream remaining      (or if you want to further harden the whole batch before      dishing it up), you can easily "cure" the soft food for      several hours. To do so, simply cover the treat (in the      metal container) with foil or plastic wrap, replace the top      on the can, and tightly plug the hole in the lid's center      with a cork. After you've drained off any remaining brine      solution through the tub's side hole, repack the freezer      with new layers of ice and salt (using a bit more rock salt      per volume of ice than you did during the freezing      process). Finally, wrap the tub in a heavy towel or burlap      bag, and set it away in a cool place until serving time.    </p>    <p>      You can also preserve the homemade dessert for an even      longer period of time. If you're using a unit whose inner      can is small enough to fit into a refrigerator's freezing      compartment, just place the can in your kitchen freezer for      three hours. Then transfer the hardened ice cream to      plastic containers for long-term cold storage . . . where      it should keep for as long as a month.    </p>    <p>      Whether you devour the icy heat-beater freshly frozen or      put it by to savor on one of those scorching August      afternoons, you're sure to agree that homemade ice cream is      just about the best taste around for a summertime dessert.      It's cool, refreshing, and-best of all-a natural treat that      you create yourself!    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO FREEZE FOOLPROOF DESSERTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>The basic recipe for preparing your own ice cream is      quite simple . . . just remember "M.E.S.S."! The acronym      stands for milk (and cream), eggs, salt, and sweetener . .      . a formula that's used as the foundation for</em> all      <em>old-fashioned ice creams. The milk, cream, and eggs      contain important natural stabilizing elements that will      keep your homemade batch smooth, even after freezing . . .      while the salt and sweetener have a crucial effect on      the</em> taste <em>of the finished product. Besides those      basic ingredients, all the mixture will need are any      fruits, extracts, or other flavorings you might want to      add.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>However, the M. E. S. S. recipe isn't a hard and fast      rule . . . there</em> are <em>some possible variations. If      you'd like to avoid the high cost of supermarket whipping      cream, for example, it's possible to substitute      half-and-half . . . although ice cream made with the less      expensive dairy product won't have as smooth a texture as      will a confection containing heavy cream, and the lighter      dessert will tend to ice up when stored for longer than a      day or so.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You might also want to use honey in place of processed      sugar, but be prepared for an ice cream with a subtly      different taste. Use the natural sweetener sparingly,      and</em> never <em>in as large a proportion as sugar. A      good rule of thumb is to start with only</em> half <em>as      much honey as the amount of sugar that's called for in the      recipe, and add more-to tasteif you feel it's needed.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Keep in mind, too, that honey doesn't permit the cream      to whip up as well as sugar does, and will sometimes even      fail</em> <em>to blend well with other ingredients. So if      the end product tastes flat or has a grainy texture, you      can probably blame it on the amount of honey you used. Just      keep experimenting (and tasting!) . . . and you'll      eventually hit upon your own</em> version <em>of</em>      <em>the ideal homemade treat.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If you're making a fruit-flavored ice</em> cream, the      natural ingredients will need to <em>be sweetened before      they're added to the M.E. S. S. mix, since a certain amount      of any fruit's natural flavor is lost in the freezing      process. Mash up about 3/!, of your produce and add sugar      or honey to please your tastebuds. The remaining berries,      peaches, etc. should be left whole or cut into      pieces-depending upon their size-and put in during the      final minutes</em> <em>of</em> <em>churning. (Fruit. ice      cream, by the way, has a more muted color than do the      fruits themselves . . . so don't be surprised</em> if,      <em>for example, your apricot - flavored confection      turns</em> <em>out to be white!)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>A "BERRY GOOD" DISH</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>One</em> <em>of</em> <em>the most distinctive-and best      - tastes in the world of natural fruit ice cream has to be      raspberry . . . and you can make the tart confection with      either fresh or frozen berries. Mix 2 cups of cream and      1</em> <em>cup of</em> <em>milk (or 3 cups</em> <em>of</em>      <em>half-and-half) together with one fresh egg, 1/y      teaspoon</em> <em>of</em> <em>salt, and about 1/y cup of      cane sugar. (Actually, the amount of sugar you add will      vary, according to the tartness of the fruit and to your      own taste preference. Remember, also, to sweeten the mashed      fruit</em> before you <em>mix it with the M. E. S. S. ) The      recipe calls for a total of 2 cups mashed raspberries, or      approximately the amount contained in two small produce      baskets. Raspberry ice cream has a unique taste that's      actually tart and sweet at the same time . . . and it's      sure to have ice cream lovers--and even skeptics-lined up      for seconds.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>THE TOP BANANA</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Unlike raspberries, bananas require very</em> little      <em>extra sweetener . . . and the tropical fruits are      especially delicious in ice cream when combined with nuts.      You should always use very</em> ripe <em>fruit in      banana-nut ice cream . . . but you can</em> <em>put in any      kind of nuts you prefer (try dryroasted peanuts, sliced      almonds, or finely chopped walnuts for starters). The      M.E.S.S. for this recipe consists of 2 cups of cream and      1-1/2 cups</em> <em>of</em> <em>milk (or s-1/2 cups of      half-andhalf), one fresh egg, 1/4 teaspoon</em> <em>of</em>      <em>salt, and 2/3 cup of cane sugar. Once the base as well      blended, fold in 1 pound of the ripe, mashed fruit (which      is usually equal to about 2 or 3 bananas) and 1/2 cup of      .crushed nuts . . . then freeze at up and watch it      disappear!</em>    </p>    <h3>YOGURT OF THE GODS</h3>    <p>      <em>Here's good news for folks who like the idea</em>      <em>of</em> <em>a pure, homemade dessert but don't want to      consume all the calories that ice cream contains: It's      possible to make delectable frozen</em> yogurt <em>in your      home ice cream freezer! Simply puree whatever fruit you      want to usealong with some sweetener-in a blender . . . and      then mix the mashed fruit with plain yogurt, right in the      freezer can. The procedure for freezing the nourishing      treat is just the same as for ice cream . . . and, after 18      to ;20 minutes of cranking, you'll turn out a cooling      dessert that's both low in calories and high in      protein.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>(Strawberries make an</em> especially <em>delicious      frozen yogurt. Just blend 4 cups</em> <em>of</em> <em>plain      yogurt with 1/4 cup of cane sugar and then fold in</em>      <em>1</em> <em>cup of mashed, sweetened strawberries . . .      either fresh or frozen. Save another 1/2 cup of berries-cut      into chunks-to pop into the mix during the last few turns      of the crank.)</em>    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: All of the two-quart recipes given above      were taken from Old Uncle Gaylord's Ice Cream Book: A Guide      to the Art & Pleasure of Old-Fashioned Ice Cream      Making, by Gaylord Willis and Ted Benhari . . . a fine      little volume, which you can order-for $2.75 plus $1.00      shipping and handling-from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.
