                <p>      It's savory, crisp, spicy, sweet, tart, nippy, tangy, and      versatile . . .    </p>            <p>      Making sauerkraut is a delicious, traditional way to      preserve all that extra cabbage your garden produces... and      krautmakin' is a remarkably quick and easy process, too!    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact-when you combine shredded cabbage      and salt in a nonmetal container-it's almost      impossible <em>not</em> to make a success of this tasty      staple. The two ingredients provide the necessary brine . .      . and bacteria (which are naturally present on cabbage      leaves) will initiate the fermentation process that allows      you to store the kraut through the long winter months.    </p>    <h3>      FIRST, THE UTENSILS    </h3>    <p>      In order to start krautin', you'll need to gather up a      sharp knife, a kraut (or slaw) shredder, a large pan,      scales, a measuring spoon or cup, a nonmetallic vessel      that's large enough to hold your cabbage supply, a pencil      and a notepad, a wooden tamper or "stomper", a pressure      plate (this can be a wooden disk or dinner plate) to fit      inside the crock or jar, a heavy rock to weight the plate,      and a thermometer to measure the air temperature. Add a      nice clean work area with plenty of elbow room to cut and      "stomp" . . . and you're set to go!    </p>    <p>      The only ingredients required for your homemade kraut are      firm, fresh heads of cabbage and "pickling" salt . . . a      flavoring which has none of the chemical additives that can      affect food color and taste. (Some folks say that sea salt      also works fine.)    </p>    <p>      Slice the cabbages in half and remove their hearts (save      these to marinate in oil, vinegar, and spices for some      delicious "refrigerator pickles" . . . a real treat!), then      shred the vegetable with a slaw cutter, catching the      chopped leaves in a large pan.    </p>    <p>      When all your cabbage is shredded, weigh it on the scales      (taking into account the heft of the pan it's in), and      <em>record</em> the weight of each batch before mixing the      vegetable and salt in a large earthenware pot or a jar.    </p>    <p>      You'll need enough salt to equal about 2.5% of the weight      of your cabbage. It's safe to figure that a 10-gallon crock      will hold about 80 pounds of shredded cabbage . . . which      would require two pounds of salt. In such a case, just      place your cabbage in the crock in eight 10-pound layers .      . . and add 1/4 pound of salt per layer. (If you're using a      five-gallon container, you can cut the amounts-and      layer sizes-in half.)    </p>    <h3>      STOMP, STOMP, STOMP    </h3>    <p>      As each cabbage/salt level is completed, the mixture must      be tamped or "stomped"-with a wooden mallet-to      release the cabbage's natural juices . . . and to mix the      salt with the vegetable liquid in order to form a curing      brine.    </p>    <p>      When all the layers have been added and stomped, the      container should be filled to within three or four inches      of the top . . . and all the vegetable matter covered with      brine. Then place the plate on the mixture and weight it      down with a rock. (Any cabbage that's <em>not</em> held      under the brine will soon rot.) Top the crock with a clean      cloth-to keep out insects and debris-and store      the vessel for the fermentation period.    </p>    <p>      Kraut will cure nicely on a warm back porch <em>or</em> in      a cool basement . . . but the environment will influence      the flavor of the finished product: A warn curing      temperature will speed up the fermentation process, while a      <em>cooler</em> area will result in a longer curing time.      Short fermentation tends to produce "sweet" kraut . . .      prolonged, cool pickling results in "tart"-really      sour-sauerkraut.    </p>    <p>      While your kraut's fermentation is progressing, inspect the      crock every day or two and skim off any mold or scum that      may form on the surface of the brine. Such layers are      created by airborne, yeastlike bacteria that utilize the      vital lactic acid as a source of food. While harmless in      itself, the mold can lower the concentration of lactic acid      below the point necessary for preservation.    </p>    <p>      As the curing continues, bubbles will form and work in the      brine. A cessation of this activity indicates that the      pickling process has reached completion. At this point, you      can serve up the first batch . . . then store the container      in a much cooler place-such as a root cellar-to      arrest further fermentation and keep your kraut tasty for      the coming year . . . and/or preserve the kraut      indefinitely by canning it. (Take care to fill the jars      with <em>additional</em> brine when an insufficient amount      remains from curing . . . then seal them, heat to boiling      in a water bath, hold that temperature for 30 minutes, and      retighten the lids.)    </p>    <h3>      A TASTE SURPRISE    </h3>    <p>      Homemade kraut is always an adventure, because no two      batches of this delicacy ever turn out exactly alike. In      fact, if it's consistent flavor you want, you'd better      stick to the storebought variety.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, there's no "best" method for preparing this tasty      dish. The advice given here will get you started with your      first batch, but you might want to try a little more (or      less) salt in your second recipe . . . to get the tang      that's exactly to your personal liking. Experiment with a      crockful that's been warm-temperature cured, and then a      cool one.    </p>    <p>      Remember: Although there are <em>scads</em> of ways to turn      out delicious sauerkraut, there're even more ways to enjoy      it: hot with dumplings, baked with spare ribs, in      sandwiches or soups, with hot dogs or knackwurst, boiled      with dried peas, with Thanksgiving turkey or roast duck or      goose ... even just eaten raw by the handful, straight from      the crock.    </p>
