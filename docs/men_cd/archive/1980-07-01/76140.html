I'lleven try to answer your questions about down-home music . . . but--bothfor the benefit of all MOTHER's readers and to ease my correspondence load--I'lldeal with those questions, whenever possible, here in this column . . .rather than in personal letters.</em></p><p><em>Addressyour correspondence--</em> for this <em>column and</em> this column <em>only--toMarc Bristol, 31722 N.E. 180th Place, Duvall, Wash. 98019.</em></p><h2 id="subtitle">Share Some Down-HomeMusic</h2><p>Asyou know, music is one of those activities that are a lot more fun whenthey're shared with good friends . . . but it's often difficult <em>(especially</em> for anyone who lives in a remote, rural area) to find people to gettogether and jam with. In fact, I receive quite a few letters from folkswho want to know how to locate other homegrown musicians.</p><p>Maybeyou've been faced with this same problem . . . or maybe you're just yearningto meet someone who can teach you a few new tunes to work on. In eithercase, here are a few suggestions on how to deal with a musical "dry spell". . . <em>and</em> bring a little culture to your community at the same time.</p><h3>PUBLIC JAMS</h3><p>Firstof all, pick up your guitar (or mandolin, or fiddle, or <em>whatever</em> instrumentyou play) and head on down to a local club or tavern that sponsors jamsessions. Also called "open mike" nights, such get-togethers usually featurea mixture of professional and amateur talent <em>. . . so everyone</em> thatdrops by can have a chance to join in the action. In most cases the band--orthe solo performer--who's hired by the club will sing a set of songs (toput everyone in the right mood) . . . and then the management will turnthe stage over to anyone else who might want to play. Each player is normallyallotted a fixed time slot . . . which should be <em>at least</em> 30 minuteslong, since a picker needs time to get warmed up to his instrument andto the crowd.</p><p>Ina looser variation of the standard arrangement, the band--following its <em>own</em> set--invites musicians in the audience to join in as it continuesto play. This kind of jam may become a little confusing <em>(and</em> noisy!),but it's also a lot of fun for the entire house. The open mike events I'veparticipated in were most often a combination of the two types: Some peopleplayed with the band, while others took the stage alone.</p><p>Whicheverway it's organized, an open mike program seems to benefit everyone involved.The club's management has an opportunity to audition new talent <em>(and</em> provide a lot of nocost entertainment in the process!) . . . the bandusually is guaranteed a large, enthusiastic audience (even on traditionallyslack week nights) ... and local pickers have a chance to try out theirlicks, while meeting new friends and fellow musicians.</p><h3>DO-IT-YOURSELFGATHERINGS</h3><p>Openmikes <em>are</em> great opportunities . . . but what can you do if theresimply aren't any taverns or coffeehouses in your area where such eventsare routinely held? Well--if that's the case--it's really not as difficultas you might think to organize your <em>own</em> gathering . . . even ifyou don't have access to sound amplification equipment.</p><p>Allyou really need is a <em>place,</em> such as a public library, a church socialhall, or even your own living room. Plan weekly or monthly meetings foryour "song circle" . . . and advertise the event by placing notices onbulletin boards at the post office, general store, laundromat, and so forth.In addition, you might like to submit a small written announcement of yourplans to the local newspaper editor, who will probably be glad to printthe item (as long as the event it describes is a non-profit venture). Besure, when doing so, to include the jamboree's date and location and aphone number that people can call for information--in the article.</p><p>Asmall "folklore society" such as the kind I'm suggesting here can be agreat way for a few people to get together and share their music. But itis limited to a small group, simply by the lack of any sound reinforcement.</p><p>Ofcourse, you don't need to own a P.A. system to organize a public open mike.If a local club manager has a sound system (or has access to one), youmight be able to arrange a jam in his or her establishment. In that case,the owner would sponsor the event, but you would have the responsibilityfor putting it together and (probably) for emceeing it . . . so you shouldeven be paid a small organizer's fee for your work!</p><p>Oneother thought on the subject: If your open mike is going to take placein a commercial establishment, I think it's a good idea to offer more thanjust beer and wine at the bar. A lot of us musicians just aren't fond ofbooze (we find we can get loose on the excitement of the jam alone!) andwould be happier with good of fruit juice or tea. For that reason, youmay find that if your event is organized in an establishment, such as acoffeehouse, that has both alcohol <em>and</em> other beverages available,you'll be able to please a wider range of customers.</p><h3>A"HUMAN JUKEBOX"</h3><p>Manypeople also write me for ideas on how to reach those unfortunate elementsof the population who haven't yet been turned on to music. My answer isalways that it's really up to the musician--with his or her enthusiasm forthe subject--to get the word out to such unenlightened souls. And thereare several ways (besides the open mike gatherings) to introduce musicinto a community. The project I'm going to tell you about is especiallyattractive to the young'uns . . . so--who knows?--you may even provide theinitial spark for a child's lifelong interest in music.</p><p>Oneof my favorite gigs involves appearing--as "the human jukebox"--at schoolcarnivals, parties, and other social events. My inspiration for this "act"came from a street musician I saw once in San Francisco. This fellow stationedhimself--hidden in a colorfully decorated box--on a sidewalk, and playedthe musical requests of interested passersby on his horn.</p><p>Usingthat man's "juke" as a model, I fashioned a large refrigerator carton intoa "music box" . . . by cutting the container open up the back and thenslicing in both directions just under the lid and about halfway along thesides of the box. Then I folded the side panels out a bit to expand thecarton and to make room for both my guitar and me inside. Of course ifyou prefer you could remove the back of the carton entirely, and hang acurtain across the opening (as shown in the accompanying diagram).</p><p>Onthe front of the homemade music machine, I carved out two square holes.The lower one was fitted with a sound amplifier for my microphone, andthe upper window boasted a miniature light show . . . which I created usinga pane of frosted plexiglass, plus a revolving four-color Christmas treespotlight and some suspended geometric shapes cut from paper.</p><p>Mymusical offerings were then listed on a poster which was mounted on theface of the box. I included 25 songs in my repertoire . . . and <em>half</em> of those titles were illustrated by small pictures so that preschooltots could join in wherever I set the device up the human jukebox is always a highlysuccessful venture, but I'm not sure <em>who is</em> more entertained byit . . . my audience (as they hear my music) or me (as I watch the totsin the crowd react to the "singing box")!</p><h3>PASS THEWORD</h3><p>Anotherkind of musical promotion that I enjoy is conducting homemade instrumentworkshops . . . in which schoolchildren, scout troops, or folk festivalfans of all ages can learn how easy it is to play a homegrown musicmaker.I take along a variety of instruments I such as washtub basses, jugs, washboards,spoons, musical saws, and kazoos), and demonstrate each one before passingit around for everyone to try. Then I accompany (on the guitar or banjo)the participants' first musical attempts. Should you decide to lead similarworkshops in your area, you might be able to get funding from your countyarts commission as I do if you schedule the meetings in public places.</p><p>So,there you have it, folks . . . a few ideas on how to get some local playerstogether, have a good time, and "culturize" your community to boot! Allit really takes is a little energy and enthusiasm to pass the word thatmusic can be a lot of fun for everybody. If you decide to try any of theideas I've mentioned in this column land I hope you will! ), write andlet me know how your efforts turn out . . . and happy musicmaking!</p><h3>A CHANGEOF PACE</h3><p>WhileI'm on the subject of bringing a greater awareness of music to your community(nut to the nonmusical public in general), I'd like to take the opportunityto present the Homegrown Music column's first--and probably last--movie review.(After all, it's spring here in Duvall, Washington as I'm writing this. . . and the turn of the season is an appropriate time for a person tostep beyond his or her regular boundaries a little.)</p><p>Notlong ago, I traveled Into town to see Coal Miner's <em>Daughter . . . a</em> film which, as many of you probably know, is based upon the autobiographywritten by country music star Loretta Lynn. I've seen a good many movieportrayals of musicians over the years, but most such films seem to dealwith artists who've died (usually in a dramatic, or melodramatic, manner). . . and it was refreshing to watch the reenacted life of a performerwho has had the inner strength required to live <em>through the</em> badtimes.</p><p>Thestory seemed heartwarmingly real to me especially when compared to theentertaining, but at times shallow, presentation of the country music worldin Robert Altman's Nashville and I'd like to thank everyone involved withthe film for making the experience available to the real of us. And mostof all, I'd like to thank Loretta . . . for sharing her life with the world.</p><h3>ANDFINALLY . . .</h3><p>Agreat many folks have written to me in response to the article on musicalsaws that ran In this column some time ago ("The Festival of the Saws",MOTHER NO. 61, page 166 ) . One of the concerns expressed by many of thosepeople was that we should be sure to publish the scheduled dates fur thisear's Festival of the Saws well enough in advance so that folks can planto attend.</p><p>Well,I've just received an updated schedule and am happy to announce that theupcoming sawyers' fest will be held in Santa Cruz, California on September8 and 7. Anyone interested in more explicit Information can get it by writing--includinga self-addressed, stamped envelope to "Saw Festival", c/o KUSP-FM, Box413, Santa Cruz, California 95062.</p>
