                <p>      <strong>The ingredients for a memorable summer meal are      probably just waiting to be collected from your back      yard.<br /></strong>    </p>            <p>      Although you've no doubt noticed the riotous display of      color that can often be found in pastures, woods, and      fields at this time of year, you may not know that there's      <em>another way</em> to enjoy summer's wildflowers ... in      tasty dinner dishes! Many members of the lily family in      particular-several of which bloom in late      summer-offer quite edible <em>and</em> delicious)      food to the alert forager.    </p>    <p>      The classification Liliaceae-an enormous and diverse      family-provides an especially rich variety of wild food ...      in addition to such domesticated delicacies as leeks,      onions, garlic, chives, and shallots. The group includes      the so-called "true lilies" (members of the genus      <em>Lilium</em> ) and many other genera as well. (Even      though some of the 20 <em>Lilium</em> species native to      North America are being threatened by the expansion of      agricultural land or by excessive harvesting for ornamental      purposes, not <em>all</em> lilies are in danger of      extinction ... and the <em>abundant varieties</em> can      tempt foragers with tasty bulbs, shoots, leaves, and      blossoms.)    </p>    <h3>      A LILY A DAY    </h3>    <p>      The familiar day lily (one decidedly unendangered species)      will make a delicious contribution to any meal of wild      foods. Chances are there's a bumper crop of the flowers      within a short walk from your home ... so why not use the      surplus plants to enliven your family's dinner menu? Such      thinning won't hurt the flower stand at all, since the      hardy plants reseed and spread quite readily.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hemerocallis fulva</em> is a perennial      herb-native to an area stretching from New Brunswick      to Ontario, then southward across much of the United      States-which bears long, swordlike leaves and      trumpetshaped orange blooms. Day lilies are a      "double-barreled" food source, too ... since they have      edible portions that can be harvested during both warm and      cold seasons.    </p>    <p>      The early spring shoots are delicious when eaten raw in      salads ... and, some months later, you can gather the      nearly full-sized unopened buds, cook them in boiling      water, add butter and seasoning, and serve them like green      beans. Furthermore, the fully opened blossomswhich, because      they last only one day, give the flower its name-make      delicious fritters when dipped in a rich egg batter and      quickfried to a deep golden brown. You can also add the      flavorful buds and blooms (or even the withered flowers) to      soups and stews.    </p>    <p>      Many wild food enthusiasts claim that lilies actually taste      better after they've been dried ... and it's quite easy to      dehydrate the buds and blossoms in your own attic (or in      any warm, arid room). Simply spread the freshly gathered      flower parts on sheets of newspaper for about one week ...      or string them on heavy thread and hang them up. After      they've completely dried, you can store the buds and      flowers in separate airtight containers. Then-when      you're ready to use them in recipes -regenerate the      dehydrated blooms by soaking them in warm water (to cover)      until they're soft and pliable again.    </p>    <p>      You can dig up day lily roots during any season of the      year, as long as the ground isn't frozen ... but the best      "harvests" will occur in the fall and winter, when the      tinybulbs' flavor matures to the sweetness of whole-grain      corn. To prepare the roots, wash and scrub them, then boil      them in salted water for about 15 minutes before serving.      (They can also be baked or roasted- like potatoes-until      they're tender.)    </p>    <h3>      TRY THESE LILIES, TOO    </h3>    <p>      Many of the "true" lilies are too rare to be collected as      food ... but the Canada lily (Lilium <em>canadense)      and</em> the Turk's-cap lily (L. superbum) each provides      good <em>-and</em> abundantfare. The stems and leaves of      the two plantsboth of which produce large orange-red blooms      in the late summer-can be cooked like green      vegetables and served with melted butter.    </p>    <p>      The famous northwestern camass-an edible member of      the genus Camassia-grows from a bulb which can be      boiled to produce a thick molasses. The plant attains an      average height of two feet, and often covers the moist      meadows of Washington, Oregon, and northern California with      early-summer carpets of blue blossoms. In the past, the      delicious, nutlike bulbs of the camass served as a major      barter crop for the Nez Perce and other Northwest Indian      tribes ... and the plant reportedly saved members of the      Lewis and Clark expedition from starvation, after the      group's more conventional supplies were exhausted.    </p>    <p>      The Indians steamed the small bulbs of <em>Camassia</em>      <em>quamash-in an</em> underground pit-for one or two      days until the soft tubers were oozing with sticky sweet      syrup ... and then pressed them into cakes to dry in the      sun. Camass bulbs can be eaten raw, dried, baked, or      roasted ... although they should be used in <em>small</em>      portions, since the plant tends to have an emetic effect if      consumed in excess.    </p>    <p>      One eastern species of the camass, C. scilloides, is      commonly called wild hyacinth (because of the shape of its      pale lavender flowers), although-like its western      cousin-it's actually a member of the lily family. The      herbaceous plant-growing in meadows and woods from      Wisconsin to Pennsylvania-springs from a solid corm      root ... which can be eaten raw, boiled for 20 to 30      minutes, or baked in foil at 350 Â°F for 45 minutes. The      seed pods of the eastern camass are also edible ... and are      tasty raw (in salads) or cooked as a green vegetable.    </p>    <h3>      ERYTHRONIUM EDIBLES    </h3>    <p>      Approximately 15 species of the genus <em>Erythronium      are</em> native to North America: Four are found east of      the Mississippi, while the rest grow in the western      mountains and northward to British Columbia. These edible      lilies, which are often known by such unlikely names as      adder's-tongue and dogtooth violet, can provide prime      foraging material, since most of the species spread readily      ... and are not in danger of becoming rare or extinct.    </p>    <p>      The most well-known eastern <em>Erythro</em> nium species      is <em>E. americanum</em> (commonly called the trout lily),      which grows in moist woody regions of central North      America. Its deeply buried solid roots are edible year      round, but are more easily found in late spring when the      flowers appear. You can eat the roots boiled for 20 to 25      minutes and served with butter ... or you might like to try      the green leaves and seed pods raw in salad. Keep your      portions moderate, however: The trout lily may act as a      laxative when eaten in quantity!    </p>    <p>      The western <em>E. grandiflorum-which</em> is most      often referred to as dogtooth violet-prefers the      cool, damp soil of the Rockies ... and starts blossoming      soon after all the snow is gone. Its new spring leaves make      excellent additions to salads, as do the peppery seed pods.      Dogtooth bulbs (which can be boiled and dried for later      use) are also edible in the raw state. In fact, one of my      favorite wild food salads combines uncooked dogtooth tubers      and seed pods with a mixture of fresh day lily shoots, wild      hyacinth pods, watercress, chives, wild onions, sheep      sorrel, and dandelion greens.    </p>    <h3>      FORAGE WITH CARE    </h3>    <p>      Although-as this article points outthere are many      lilies available to every novice forager, you can't simply      go out and bring home just any species you find. It's      important that you make sure the plant is not endangered      <em>before</em> you remove it. (Such information is      available from local garden clubs or the state's natural      resources agency ... and the latter office can provide you      with a list of wildflowers that are rare in your area.)    </p>    <p>      When foraging, you must also be extremely careful <em>not      to</em> collect a <em>poisonous</em> plant ... and several      members of the Liliaceae family do contain dangerous      toxins. (For example, the deadly <em>Zygadenus-death</em>      camass"- closely resembles its edible relative: However,      normal camass blossoms range from blue to white, while the      death camass bears cream-colored blooms. Every part of the      death camass is virulently poisonous ... and the toxic      plant causes great losses of livestock annually.) In many      cases, only an expertor a comprehensive field      manual-will be able to help you positively identify      the growth ... <em>so</em> <em>don't dig up or eat any part      of a plant unless you're totally sure of its identity.</em>    </p>    <p>      But-as long as you stick to familiar plants and take      advantage of the advice of a good field guide or an      experienced forager-you should be able to put      together many exciting, tasty summer meals with      wildflowers. Using a little caution and a pair of sharp      eyes (the essential tools of any wild food gatherer),      you're sure to harvest a bucketful of lilies that are not      only beautiful ... but also deliciously edible!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Both beginning and</em> expert f oragers      may be <em>in</em> teres ted <em>in</em> these excellent      field guides <em>and cookbooks:</em>    </p>    <p>      [1] Feasting Free on Wild Edibles <em>by Bradford      Angier,</em> $5.95.    </p>    <p>      [2] Color Field Guide to Common Wild Edibles <em>by      Bradford An</em> gier, $2.95.    </p>    <p>      [3] A Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants of Eastern and      Central North America <em>by</em> Lee Peterson, $8.95.    </p>    <p>      [4] Stalking the Wild Asparagus <em>by</em> Euell      <em>Gibbons, $3</em> .95.    </p>    <p>      [5] Billy Joe Tatum's Wild Foods Cookbook and Field Guide,      edited <em>by Helen Witty,</em> $4.95.    </p>    <p>      <em>You can buy</em> <em>these fine works in many good      bookstores, or order them for their listed prices (plus      $1.00 shipping and handling for any purchase totaling less      than $10 ... larger orders are postpaid) from Mother's      Bookshelf, P.O.
