                    <p>      When it comes to having the potential of homegrown alcohol      fuel, the old<br />      adage-"seeing is believing"-will make special      sense to all the folks who join MOTHER. ..    </p>        <p>      Since one picture is worth a good ten thousand words (more      or less) we thought you might like to take a look at some      of the sights in store for everyone who participates in      MOTHER's Alcohol Fuel Tour of Brazil, which will take place      from January 17 to 31, 1981. (The trip was originally      planned to last ten days, but the vast number of things to      see and do in that South American land-combined with      the Cariocan "let's do it tomorrow" attitude -convinced us      that it would be best to stretch out the trip to a full two      <em>weeks!)</em>    </p>    <p>      The photos accompanying this article were all taken during      a "shakedown trip" made by MOTHER's tour director, Sara      Pacher, and this publication's research coordinator,      Richard Freudenberger.    </p>    <p>      The pair's intent was to investigate the Brazilian program      that aims to switch that country's vehicles to "liquid      sunshine" by 1985 . . . and MOTHER's staffers came away      impressed with the remarkable progress that has been made      thus far.    </p>    <p>      All Brazilian gasoline, as an example, now contains 20%      alcohol . . . thousands of cars (including government and      utility fleets) have been converted to run on pure ethanol      . . . especially designed alcohol-fueled cars are presently      pouring off the assembly lines at Brazil's Ford, General      Motors, Fiat, and Volkswagen plants . . . and Mercedes-Benz      (which dominates the country's truck and bus market) has      even converted some Sao Paulo diesel commuter buses to run      on the renewable fuel. (See the article on page 86.)    </p>    <h3>      WHAT IT WILL INCLUDE    </h3>    <p>      In the course of our Brazilian tour, we'll see all those      innovations <em>and</em> take a look at sugar cane      plantations where the crops are distilled on a mass basis .      . . visit the Aerospace Technical Center, where the alcohol      fuel program was largely developed and scientists are now      hard at work researching the best renewable source of      <em>diesel</em> fuel . . . and talk to engineers and      environmentalists -plus one of Brazil's most prominent and      popular physicists-about the nation's brave new experiment      in energy self-sufficiency. Of course, we'll also take some      time to see the sights, shop, and soak up the tropical sun      on Rio's wide, world-renowned beaches . . . which are as      white as Brazilian sugar!    </p>    <p>      A few of the coming trip's fine points have yet to be      worked out, so we can't-just yet-give you a      firm price on this tour . . . however, we estimate the      entire package will run about $2,000, including airfare. If      you think you'd like to leave next winter's Ice and cold      for an informative (and fun) excursion into the South      American summer, let us know . . . and we'll get all the      pertinent details to you as soon as possible.    </p>    <h3>      OTHER OFFERINGS    </h3>    <p>      While you're at it, you might want to find out whether      there have been any last-minute cancellations that would      allow you to join our unique Food Production Tour of the      People's Republic of China (September 8-29,1980).    </p>    <p>      Or possibly you'd like to take part in our second,      <em>expanded,</em> Solar Tour of Israel (from February 19      to March 3, 1981), which will cost $1,545including      airfareand offers an optional week's visit to Egypt.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, you might choose to participate in a      <em>new</em> solar tour (between August 23 and September 6,      1981) that will combine a trip to the International Solar      Energy Society (ISES) conference in Brighton, England with      a look at some of the sophisticated ways that France (long      a leader in sun technology) utilizes solar energy. This      tour (including airfare) is <em>tentatively</em> priced at      a scant $1,100 . . . and if air costs allow us to hold it      at that, it will be the travel bargain of the decade!    </p>    <p>      For more information-or simply to be included on our      mailing list-write to Mother's Tours, P.O.
