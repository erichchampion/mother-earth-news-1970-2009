                        <p>      As we've noted <em>several times in these pages, Helen and      .Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us whew it      cornea to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away hack in the autumn of 1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm ...      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and .Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over      again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      end Scott are famous for their stone housses) and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens ... . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      Naturally (in more ways than one/, the Nearnings have      learned a jaw things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with .MOTHER :r      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>`, P. 0. Box 70,      Henderaonville, N.C. 28791. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The moat important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered here-and      here only-where we all can read what the Nearings have to      say.    </p>    <p>      Since moving to Costa Rica recently, I've modified my      eating habits and now consume only raw foods. However,      there seems to be a shortage of material on noncooked meals      (and it's difficult here to find more than a few types of      nuts and a very few cereals with which to vary such a      diet). In a recent column, you mentioned a "no-cooking      cookbook" that you're preparing on the subject. I'd      appreciate it if you'd let your readers know when the      volume will be ready, how much it will cost, and where we      can purchase it.    </p>    <p>      I (Helen) have been working on my "simple foods for      simple-living people" recipe book for about ten years, off      and on. The publication has now gone to press and should be      available by the fall of this year. If you'll write to us      at the Social Science Institute, Dept. TMEN, Harborside      Maine 04642-sending a self-addreased, stamped      envelope-we'll let you know when the book is ready and how      much it will cost.    </p>    <p>      I'd like to begin this letter by expressing my thanks for      the knowledge and the wisdom you've been sharing with      others over the years. I admire both of you, and hope to be      able to establish myself in a rural homestead soon.    </p>    <p>      I'm curious, however, as to how you cope with the insect      problem in Maine. I've heard that some folks actually pull      up stakes and leave the state as a result of the savage      mosquitoes that swarm every summer. Is there any truth to      such stories . . . and, if so, what do you do to alleviate      the situation?    </p>    <p>      We have never suffered excessively from mosquitoes, black      flies, or ticks. Of course, we live on a saltwater bay, and      the fresh sea breezes may help keep some biting insects      away. (Our home is also surrounded by open meadows . . .      folks who live deep in the woods are probably more apt to      be bothered by bugs.)    </p>    <p>      You may be interested to know, though, that people who live      on a healthful diet (one that doesn't include sugar, salt,      or "junk food") seem to be bitten by insects less often      than are those men and women whose eating habits are more      typically "twentieth-century American". If you suffer from      more insect bites than do most folks around you, it might      be that it's time for you to change your diet!    </p>    <p>      My question might strike you as rather foolish . . . unless      you've also suffered from the problem that prompts my      query. I was born and raised in Florida, you see, but am      now living in South Dakota. As soon as winter sets in-and      from that point on until late spring-I am forced to wear      two pairs of wool socks and heavy boots outdoors . . . and      even need socks and furlined slippers when I'm in the      house. Still, my feet never seem to get warm, though I've      lived in the North for some five years now and should have      had time to acclimate myself to the harsh weather. Do you      have any suggestions?    </p>    <p>      It seems to us that your circulation is probably      inadequate. We've lived in New England through more than 40      years' worth of subzero winters, and neither Scott nor I      have ever suffered from chronically cold feet. In fact, I      often pad around on our stone floors-in the dead of      winter-barefoot! I think that our diet helps our      circulation as, certainly, does the amount of healthful      exertion involved in going about our daily chores.    </p>    <p>      You may find some help, however, in a foot exercise that      Scott performs each morning and evening . . , since the      practice certainly improves his circulation. He simply      rotates both ankles in all directions, and then rubs one      foot against the other . . . top and bottom. The      "calisthenics" stimulate his feet to such an extent that      they actually glow pink!    </p>    <p>      I'm a long-time admirer of yours, and have read all of your      works that relate to homesteading. I find myself curious      about one point: Your garden is notoriously rich and      bounteous, yet-since I gather that your guests come and go      sporadically-I assume that the two of you usually dine      alone. How, then, are you able to consume or preserve all      of your produce? Finding creative ways to serve and store      my garden crops has always been a greater problem for me      than is growing the vegetables. Can you give me some      advice?    </p>    <p>      Our garden occupies about a quarter o! an acre . . .      including the space taken up by our 10' X 40' sunheated      greenhouse, which furnishes us with greens year round. In      the garden itself we are able to grow all of the vegetables      we need, and have an ample surplus to allow us to provide      for the countless guests who share our meals and for the      visitors who often leave our home laden with fresh prod.      uce. Therefore, our garden feeds both Scott and me and many      others.    </p>    <p>      As to "creative" ways to serve and prepare garden crops, I      think you'll find that the question ( which is too      complicat. ed to be answered here) is addressed in detail      in my upcoming "anti-cooking" cookbook.    </p>    <p>      As you've often said in your writings, making a go of      living a self-sufficient lifestyle can be very difficult      indeed. Certainly, my family and I have sometimes been very      much tempted to chuck our "dream" and head back to the      city. We've resisted the temptation thus far, but find that      the urges get stronger and stronger all the time. Have you      gone through similar periods of doubt, andeven if you      haven't experienced such discouragement-can you give us      some uplifting words to repeat to ourselves during those      times when everything seems to go wrong?    </p>    <p>      We've never had the desperate Peelings you describe.      However, if-as you say-your problems and self-doubts appear      to be getting continually worse, there is definitely      something wrong with your situation . . . something so      serious that you might indeed be better off going back to      the city!    </p>    <p>      If you really want to stick it out and stay, though, we      advise that you count your blessings ... however few they      may be. Next, add up the disadvantages that you encounter .      . . multiply both the pluses and minuses by the number of      people involved in them . . . subtract the latter figure      from the former . . . and see what you have left before      making your final decision.    </p>    <p>      Finally, don't let yourself count on anything or anyone to      be perfect. Remember. every situation has its positive and      negative aspects.    </p>
