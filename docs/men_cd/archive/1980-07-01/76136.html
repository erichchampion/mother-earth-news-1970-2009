        <p>New products that MOTHER's readers should know about</p><h3>INHERIT THE WIND:</h3><p>You can put your windmill on whatever area of your property receives the most reliable breezes and still use that power to pump up to five gallons a minute from your well . . . even if the water supply is as much as a quarter-mile away. The "Bowjon Windmill/Air Lift Water Pump" consists of an eight-foot galvanized four-blade propeller and galvanized vane, an angle-steel frame, a compressor with its own weather shield, and a unique air injection pump (which has only a few-aboveground-moving parts). One man, says the manufacturer, can install the system in less than one days time . . . and its maintenance requirements are minimal, consisting of only an occasional inspection of air and water lines, plus a twice-yearly check on the compressor's oil and filter pads. (The pump can even run dry without danger of damage.) The unit sells for $695 (freight collect) and meets the requirements for energy tax credits, too. For a brochure and detailed specifications, write Bowjon, Dept. ME, 2829 Burton Ave., Burbank, Calif. 91504.</p><h3>WRITE ON:</h3><p>Bergstrom, a firm located in the heart of Wisconsin's pulp and paper mill country, specializes in producing fine writing and printing stock from recycled waste paper. And one of Bergstrom's employees is also one of the company's best customers: Philip Tallmadge and his family-which includes four teenagers-operate "Earth Right Recycled Paper Products", (a mail order recycled-stationery business) right from their home. Notepaper with wildlife designs (and matching animal tracks across the envelope) is the family's specialty. A package of 20 sheets and 10 envelopes may be ordered for $3.00 postpaid . . . or write for more product information to Earth Right, Dept. ME, P.O. Box 184, Neenah, Wis. 54956.</p><h3>MUNCH TIME:</h3><p>Celestial Seasonings, a company long known as a producer of tasty herbal teas, has brought out its first non-beverage natural food product. "Salad Snacks" are designed to be used either as salad topping or as out-of-hand snack food. The crunchy munchin's start as a combination of sunflower and pumpkin seeds, soybeans, wheat, cashews, and almonds . . . then natural seasonings are added to produce a choice of four flavors: roasted/salted, cheese, onion and garlic, and sour cream with chives. Four-ounce packages (which are large enough to make several servings) retail for about $1.10 apiece, in the same health food stores where you buy your Red Zinger and Morning Thunder tea . . . or you can write for information to Celestial Seasonings, Dept. ME, 1780 55th St., Boulder, Colo. 80301.</p><h3>THE SHOE FITS:</h3><p>"Footprint Footwear" is produced by a small family-operated business that crafts custom handmade shoes which-according to Randall and Jeanne March ington-"are tough as boots and feel like slippers". The leather uppers (available in a choice of brown or gold) are soft and flexible, and the layered soles are said to provide the massage and nerve stimulation that reflexologists approve of (a special insole of closed cell foam molds to form an exact impression of the individual foot). Patterns are made from the customer's own foot tracings, and buyers are invited to call or write to describe any special requests they might have. Prices range from $85 for the "Lowtop" to $110 for the "Kneehigh". Write-for a brochure that pictures four styles and gives detailed tracing instruction-to Footprint Footwear, Dept. ME, 60? N.W. Federal, Bend, Ore. 97701.</p><h3>BEHIND THE WHEEL:</h3><p>With bicycles being put to utilitarian, as well as pleasurable, purposes in these days of costly fuel, some means of toting goods and/ or passengers (items which have more weight than ordinary fender and handlebar baskets can manage) has become necessary. Hence the "Blue Sky Cycle Cart": It's a lightweight, all-welded, tubular-framed trailer that will carry 150 pounds . . . suspends the load below axle level for maximum stability . . . and can be quickly attached-without tools-to any bike. At $164.50, the cart comes with your choice of a heavy-duty plywood load platform or a lighter nylon bag -depending upon what kind of gear you plan to haul-and available extras include a twochild carrier and a fitted rain top. Write to Blue Sky (Dept. ME, 249 Blair Blvd., Eugene, Ore. 97402) for more details and where-to-buy information.</p><h3>HOT NEWS:</h3><p>The rituals involved in backyard cookouts can become considerably leas complicated if you use this broiler that looks like a bucket and cooks with a fuel as up-to date as today's news. In fact, the little device actually does burn newspaper, using the recycled fuel-plus your picnic meat's own drippings-to prepare delectable victuals. With the "Qwik-Cook Grill", there's no hassle about running out of charcoal and starter fluid, and no waiting for perfect coals. Just wad up some newsprint (black-and-white pages only . . . colored comics and so forth contain lead), drop in a match, and lay on the burgers or steak. The Qwik-Cook (complete with storage case, instructions, and recipes) is available at camping supply outlets or-by mail-for $24.50 postpaid from Klover Kompany, Dept. ME, Rt. 3, Box 165, Devils Lake, N.D. 58301.</p><h3>FOOT WORK:</h3><p>Everyone should know how to change a tire, of course, but that knowledge does little good if-when the big moment comes-he or she can't loosen the lug nuts! The "Strain Stopper", which was developed and tested by a senior citizens group in Canada, is designed to make that chore not only possible but almost painless: With the aid of this device, foot and leg power can provide the leverage to do a job that once produced considerable back strain. The Stopper is adjustable for all standard wheel and nut sizes . . . comes with its own high carbon steel wrench . . . and may be ordered for $8.00 (U.S. funds) postpaid from Patterson Associates, Dept. ME, 477 Raindance Crescent, North Vancouver, B.C., Canada V7P 1C3.</p><h3>SEVERANCE PAYS:</h3><p>The combination of an ancient design and modern metalworking know-how has resulted in "Snipssors'", an instrument-forged from a single piece of steel-that can be easily operated with either hand, or used with equal skill by both right- and left-handed people. The palm-sized (4-1/2-inch) cutter is said to be able to perform so many severing chores that it can replace a number of specialized scissor shapes. What's more, the tool also cuts the user's effort almost in half . . . because the honed blades spring open by themselves after each squeeze. Snipssors may be ordered for $10 apiece, postpaid (or two for $18), from Ellly, Dept. ME, 53 Barker Hill Dr., Guilford, Conn. 06437.</p><h3>POOL CUE:</h3><p>The "Hiloat" is an emergency flotation device that stores handily in a tiny space. But simply press a lever and throw the capped cylinder to a swimmer in dis tress . . . and-within 20 seconds after it hits the water-a full-sized life preserver inflates, while the mushroom-shaped top acts as a sea anchor to decrease drift. Once the crisis is over, you can replace the nontoxic, nonflammable Freon gas canister to ready the Hiloat for reuse. Hiloat Manufacturing Company (Dept. ME, 2434 N. 28th Dr., Phoenix, Ariz. 85029) will send you the unusual life buoy, postpaid, for $19.95 . . . or answer your further inquiries.</p><h3>COOL IT</h3><p>Here's a way to unsizzle your car this summer, without turning on the gas devouring air conditioner: Dieterich International, Inc. (Dept. ME, P.O. Box 3323, Vero Beach, Fla. 32960) can fix you up with "Coolux" sun and privacy shades to fit the side and rear windows of almost any car, truck, or van . . . and even those of boat and aircraft cabins. The perforated vinyl material should filter out up to 80% of ol' Sol's ferocity-and lessen the glare from snow or headlights-yet does not limit the view from inside the vehicle. Coolux sizes and varieties range from a mini-portable model that attaches to side windows with suction cups ($5.95 postpaid) . . . to a rear window heat-buster that pulls up over the glass from its mounting and retracts out of sight when not in use ($30.50). Dieterich will send you complete details on request.</p>
