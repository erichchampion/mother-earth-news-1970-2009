        <h5 id="byline"> </h5><p><strong>Like the early pioneers who started this country, many people are rebelling against the near confiscatory taxation at all levels of government. The federal government consumes the taxpayer's cash at the rate of over $800,000 per minute, and the amount that is wasted is scandalous. The citizens are mad as hell and they're not going to take it any more.</strong></p><h3>There is but one answer left!</h3><p>The U.S. was founded by a group of individuals who rebelled against the oppressive policies of King George in England. Today, this same spirit of independence, a uniquely American phenomenon, underlies a growing displeasure with government tax and spending policies. This viewpoint is a healthy sign. Our society can remain the freest and most prosperous in the world if government power is held in check by us, the citizens who make up the country. Recent passage of laws (such as Proposition 13) are an indication of a growing wave of protest against wasted tax dollars. The effort is getting stronger and more vehement every day.</p><p>The largest tax each one of us pays is Federal Income Tax. Yet, the largest corporations and the wealtiest individuals often pay the least amount of tax. According to an article in a leading newsletter, 17 huge corporations paid no federal income tax in a recent year, although they had a world-wide income of $2.5 billion. Numerous tax loopholes were used. The list includes United States Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Armco Steel, General Dynamics, Singer, Phelps Dodge, American Airlines, Philadelphia Electric and The Chase Manhatten Corporation. The burden caused by these non-taxpayers must be assumed by "somebody." "Somebody" is always the wage earner. There is, therefore, a major inequity under the law which favors the wealthy and, most especially, corporations. In America today we have what could be called a "Corporate Society."</p><p>Some individuals have become so upset with these startling inequities, they have stopped paying taxes and have in many cases even ceased to file tax returns. This approach, however, is frought with danger and has resulted in stiff fines or prison sentences when the government locates and prosecutes the courageous individuals.</p><h3>You Can Become Part of "The Corporate Society"</h3><p>Rather than break the law and suffer serious consequences, there is a safer and more viable alternative. You can use the same type of smart thinking as those who own and control great wealth. The big corporations are not necessarily immoral. However, they do get the best advice available on tax matters.</p><p>You, as an individual, can now use all the tax loopholes for your own self interest. Thus, you legally gain the advantages yourself as do the huge corporations. Rather than break the law, you can use it to your advantage. Perhaps the best way to accomplish this, as well as reduce your tax burden is through incorporation, the legal form of tax rebellion.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, the government encourages incorporation with a number ©Enterpriae Publishing, Inc., MCMLXXX of favorable laws, especially in the area of taxation. In fact, it is rare to find a successful individual who is not incorporated.Incorporation is favored by nearly all millionaires. It is one of the causes of wealth, not its effect. Think about it. Can you think of a single wealthy individual who doesn't own and control his own corporation? It is rare indeed. Let's face it, the first step toward achieving the American Dream in our corporate society is probably incorporation.</p><p>To add even more impetus to the idea of starting your own corporation, passage of the recent Revenue Act makes incorporation the ultimate tax shelter. This act and the earlier ones close the door to practically all other tax shelters and loopholes. The tax rate on corporations (especially smaller ones) has been substantially reduced, to as low as 17%.</p><p>Favorable laws such as the investment tax credit are most helpful when buying equipment. Even if you incur losses in one year you can deduct those losses over several profitable years.</p><h3>More Advantages...</h3><p>You can set up a corporate medical plan wherein you deduct from your taxes every dollar spent on medical and dental care, drugs, and health insurance for yourself and your family. You can also get tax deductible group life insurance even if the "group" consists of only one person.</p><p>It is important to note that potential tax savings are not the only reason to incorporate. Another chief value is that it limits your liability to the assets of the corporation in the event of a lawsuit. If you do business as an individual or partnership, you can be sued personally,</p><p><em>"Over and over again courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging one's affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible. Everybody does so, rich or poor; and all do right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands; taxes are enforced exactions, not voluntary contributions. To demand more in the name of morals is mere cant. " Judge</em></p><p>Leaned Hand which could put your house and other assets in jeopardy. You can put more money (25% and more of income) into your corporation pension plan. This is more than a traditional "Keogh" plan which has a maximum contribution of $7 500 a year, or even an I.R.A., where the maximum that can be sheltered under special circumstances is only $1,750.</p><p>In these times of growing inflation and periodic and downs of the econ my, your own corporation is probably the only way that you may maintain control over your economic destiny. And you can often benefit from incorporation without leaving your present job. More about that in a moment.</p><h3>You Can Incorporate Simply, Easily and Inexpensively.</h3><p>Up until now, throughout the majority of history, incorporation had one major drawback: high legal fees.
