        <p class="caption">[1] Morton Fry holds a one-year plant that's over six feet tall. [2] This towering six-year-old tree began as a cutting. [3] In their first year of growth, these saplings are already three to four feet tall. [4] A group of two-year-old hybrid poplars ready for shipment. [5] The sturdy trunk of a 13-year-old hardwood. [6] These bundles of ten-inch cuttings are ready for shipment in the spring. Harvested while the trees were dormant, the sticks have been carried over the winter, refrigerated in damp peat moss.</p>
