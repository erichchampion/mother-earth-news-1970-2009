                    <p>      Would you like to live in the country... provide a vital      yet economically priced service...work as little as a      week...and make over $26.000 a year? Then consider this      unique chance to get into...    </p>    				    						    <p>      Folks, if you've been waiting for us to come up with the      perfect, rural-based, "be your own boss" business-one that      might be right up your alley-be sure you give this article      a darn good looking over . . . because we've discovered an      inexpensive way to get into a one-person well drilling      business that may just be one of the best home enterprises      ever!    </p>    <p>      Now, anyone who has ever seen a conventional drilling      machine will probably feel it's unlikely that an individual      could set him- or herself up in this business for a      reasonable investment . . . and there's good reason for      such skepticism! After all, the rigs most well drillers use      are massive ten-wheeled trucks-loaded with 30-foot towers,      giant engines, and heavy equipment-that can cost as much as      $300,000!    </p>    <p>      But suppose (just suppose) that you could purchase a      completely functional, hydraulicpowered, domestic water      well drilling rig that would fit on a small trailer or the      back of a pickup truck, be capable of boring a hole eight      inches in diameter and 600 feet deep . . . and yet cost a      relatively affordable $7,500? Furthermore, suppose that the      fellows who made such a miracle earth piercer were willing      to provide a two-day training course in using the device      (even if you weren't at all sure that you wanted to buy      it)?    </p>    <p>      Sounds pretty good, huh? Especially when you consider that      owning an inexpensive well drilling machine would enable      you to charge less for your services than the "big boys" do      (thus giving your customers a moneysaving break) . . . yet      still clear more profit-and get more customers-than does      the competition!    </p>    <p>      Well, it's all true! A couple of tool-happy New Mexicans      named Gailard "Skip" Piper and Roy Proctor have-entirely on      their own-invented the Piper Hydro EXPLORER 2000: a unique      well drilling ma- chine that actually accomplishes      everything described above! And MOTHER can assure you that      the small but hardy :rig does, indeed, do the job . .      .because we've seen it perform!    </p>    <h3>      HOW WELL DRILLING WORKS    </h3>    <p>      Before we can describe the specific functional virtues of      the EXPLORER 12000, we'll have to explain a bit about well      drilling in general. To begin with, there are two principal      techniques used for boring domestic water holes: cable and      rotary drilling. Cable (or "pounder") rigs hammer out a      hole by repeatedly dropping a 1,500-pound "tool string"      onto an earth-cutting bit. Any driller using such a rig      must stop every few feet and - with water and a long      bailing bucket -clean out the bottom of the hole. You might      imagine that all the required pounding and bailing would      make for some pretty slow progress . . . and, in fact,      cable rigs can take up to two weeks to drill a household      well.    </p>    <p>      Rotary drills, on the other hand, use a highpowered engine      that screws a cutting bit into the earth . . . while water      is continuously flushed down through the hollow sections of      drilling pipe (or "drill stems"), and out through holes in      the bit. The liquid washes the cuttings to the surface to      clean out the hole. Any suspended particles are then      allowed to settle out, after which a second engine (the mud      pump) cycles the water to the bottom of the well again.      Rotary drilling machines are much more expensive than cable      rigs (they cost $200,000 or $300,000, whereas new pounder      setups go for around $80,000), but the more costly devices      are also powerful enough to bore a household well in a day      or two.    </p>    <h3>      SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL    </h3>    <p>      Both rotary and cable drill operators have to charge a      considerable price for their services: The first group are      forced to do so because their equipment is so costly, and      the second because theirs is so slow. The rotary-driven      EXPLORER 2000, though, can work rapidly enough to -as Skip      Piper says-"wax those cable pounders" . . . yet its      purchase price undercuts that of other rotary rigs by a      factor of 30!    </p>    <p>      What's the secret of Roy and Skip's rig? Well, its main      asset is, simply enough, an economy of scale. Most rotary      machines are-in addition to their water-finding      jobs-designed to have the capability to drill oil or      industrial wells that are over 2,400 feet deep! Every      feature of such a machine must be massive: It uses a pair      of large, fuel-guzzling engines, a 30- to 60 foot tall      drilling tower, drill stems that often can't be raised      without a crane, massive pumps to circulate huge quantities      of water, etc. (In fact, the rig's operators may need to      own one extra truck just to carry the drill stems . . .      another for toting essential spare parts . . . and yet a      third to haul the necessary water! )    </p>    <p>      Obviously, using such a large-capacity drill to cut a 100-      or 200-foot domestic well is a clear case of mechanical      overkill. So Skip and Roy are able to save a great deal of      expense and energy simply by using a machine whose size      more nearly matches the demands of the specific job. As an      example, the EXPLORER 2000's tower is only 14 feet tall-and      the drill stems 10 feet long-so all of the portable      equipment can actually be lifted by hand. The drilling      engine also uses much less power than do those of the big      rigs . . . the mud pump needs to cycle a great deal less      water . . . and the body of the rig is small and,      therefore, less expensive to build.    </p>    <p>      The two inventors have also devised several improvements      that further increase the efficiency of their scaled-down      rig. For instance, they added a wiper paddle, at a point      just above the drill bit, that-by packing the sides of the      hole as the bit descends-enables a surprisingly modest      amount of water to clear the bored opening. They've also      incorporated a labor-saving system for placing one section      of drill stem right on top of another as the well is bored      (most rotary rig operators have to raise alt their buried      drill stems every time they want to add a new section!).      Not only that, but the two tinkering Southwesterners have      created a uniquely effective hydraulic system . . . which      enables the 2000 to achieve extra drilling torque with its      small engine!    </p>    <p>      The end result is a machine that appears downright flimsy      when compared to big well drilling devices. "In fact,"      jokes Skip Piper, "when I first started drilling, I had to      charge less than the other guys because my machine looked      so ridiculous! " But punyappearing or not, the EXPLORER      2000 works so well that, these days, the joke's on the      other foot . . . many competing Alamogordo drillers have      had to lower their rates to match Piper's more closely.      (One such hole cutter recently complained to Skip that the      EXPLORER has "made the whole business so simple there's no      money in it anymore".)    </p>        <h3>      DRILLING KNOW-HOW    </h3>    <p>      Should you sign up to train at Piper Hydro in Alamogordo      (the $100 fee for a two-day session is refunded if you buy      a rig), Skip and Roy will, of course, give you plenty of      field instruction in using the EXPLORER 2000. They'll also      make darn sure that you have a good understanding of such      basics as never running the drill unless you've first made      sure that water is circulating through the well hole (if it      isn't doing so, rock and mud segments can accumulate at the      base of the hole and permanently trap your expensive drill      bit! ) .    </p>    <p>      Still, the two New Mexicans will not be able to teach you      everything about the trade, because-make no mistake about      it-a lot of well drilling expertise has to come from      experience. Only a practiced "carrier" (or driller) can      recognize the stem vibration that means his or her bit is      cutting through gravel . . . and spot the color and texture      changes in the recirculating water that indicate whether      the drill is boring through rock, sand, or limestone.      There's also a lot of know-how associated with such trade      arts as using bentonite ("driller's mud") to seal the sides      of a collapsing hole, finding the best available      water-bearing layer, and installing pumps. But the Piper      crew will happily advise you after you've finished      training-as well as during the instruction period-and can      also help you obtain useful drilling reference manuals.    </p>    <h3>      $$$ AND  cents cents cents    </h3>    <p>      If you do set yourself up in business with Piper Hydro's      EXPLORER 2000 (or with the bigger 3000 model described in      the chart that accompanies this article), you'll probably      soon be in the enviable position of being able to charge      less-yet make moremoney than your competition can! Skip,      for example, charges $6.50 a foot for four-inchdiameter      wells, while most of his Alamogordo area competition asks      $8.00 a foot. (Before Piper came along, the local prices      often went as high as $12.50 a foot!) Yet-while the other      drillers have so many loan, insurance, upkeep, operating,      and labor expenses that they operate on a fairly slim      profit margin-Skip clears $5.00 a foot . . . after      expenses!    </p>    <p>      Now stop and think about that figure for a minute. True,      standard well drilling charges do vary widely around the      country (our research shows that such costs range from as      little as $6.00 a foot to over $20.00) . In addition, the      depth of wells will differ from one area to another (with      the average depth being around 200 feet). But if you can      make the same margin of profit-where you live-that Piper      does, then every time you spend a day drilling a 100-foot      well, you'll clear $500! If you drib only one such well a      week, you'll earn $26,000 a year!    </p>    <h3>      BUT IS IT RIGHT FOR YOU?    </h3>    <p>      So now you know why we say well drilling with the EXPLORER      2000 can be a great home business! But-before you hop on a      plane to Alamogordo- check out your area and see just how      open (or closed) the well drilling market is.    </p>    <p>      How can you find such information? Skip says, "Simply phone      a few local drillers, ask what they charge to drill a well,      and then find out if they can do it tomorrow . . . if they      can't, there's probably plenty of business around."    </p>    <p>      Roy, though, likes to add some additional words of advice:      "First," he says, "find out whether your area is experi    </p>    <p>      encing some domestic growth. For instance, the outskirts of      expanding cities, or rural land that's being split into      smaller parcels, will provide good possibilities for a new      drilling business. Then call up your County Extension Agent      or Department of Water Resources and learn the local ground      water conditions . . . because-who knows?-you just might      live in an area where people can't find water unless they      drill to tremendous depths. Better yet, phone a local well      driller and ask about the 'worst case' that he or she has      encountered. You can be sure that conditions can't possibly      be any more discouraging than what that expert will      describe!"    </p>    <p>      Roy and Skip also realize that you may be interested in      their rigs even if you don't plan to become a professional      driller. In fact, the two men recently developed the small      EXPLORER 200 (which costs less money than many people would      likely have to pay someone else to drill a well) just to      suit folks who want to bore only one or two water holes for      themselves or their neighbors.    </p>    <p>      Both fellows are primarily interested, though, in setting      things straight-in a profession that they think often      overcharges its customers-by helping individuals get into      fulltime well work. So if you're interested in becoming a      well borer, check out your local market, then write off to      Piper Hydro and consider spending a few days in the of      "Land of Enchantment". After all, no home business idea is      right for everyone . . . but, folks, this one is bound to      suit some of MOTHER's readers mighty well!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For more information on Piper Hydro's water      well drilling equipment, send $3.50 (refundable with      purchase) to Piper Hydro Drilling, Dept.
