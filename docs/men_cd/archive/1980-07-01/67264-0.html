        CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT: To make s wizened back-to-the-lender, peel a large apple, carne out miniature facial featuresbeing careful not to whittle too deeply or too shallowly-and add a few ""laugh lines"" . . . . Let the ""doll in the rough""soak for about a minute in a lemon juice bath . .. and then sprinkle the little face with non-iodized salt. The salt and citric juice will preserve the fruit .... String up your ""appleheads"" on wire to cure, and hang them in a north-facing window for a two- to fourweek drying spell .... Twist a lightgauge, doubled coat hanger into a stick figure, and wrap the form in rags to put some ""meat"" on your applehead doll's bones .... Assembled, coiffured, and dressed, these appleheads--crafted at home with SO cents' worth of suppliesrival any $20 dolls sold at gift shops.
