                    <p>      <strong>La Vonne McKillip points out that-especially in      these days of runaway inflation-it pays to have</strong> .      . .    </p>        <p>      As a child of the soil for 55 years-and the wife of a      land-tiller for 37 of those years-I've had plenty of time      to learn the dirt farmer's particular brand of conservation      economics. Long-range plans are fundamental to a rural way      of thinking and living, and back-to-thelanders who lack the      vision and determination necessary to put such plans into      practice soon return to their cities and towns . . . where      paychecks come once a week or a month instead of with the      yearly harvest. On the other hand folks who make longrange      plans <em>work</em> can count on getting safely through      most government-created <em>-or</em> natural-disasters.    </p>    <p>      The inflation fighting and conservation techniques that      I'll describe will deal specifically with the family food      supply . . . but the <em>philosophy</em> behind my methods      can be applied to the way we handle all our earth's      resources.    </p>    <h3>      YEAR-TO-YEAR SHOPPING    </h3>    <p>      To begin at the beginning, I'd like to describe the time      (and money) saving techniques I use when shopping:    </p>    <p>      Before considering bulk purchases, I read the local      newspaper (which can be a first-rate tool for fighting      inflation) to compare the prices at the area's supermarkets      . . . keeping a special eye out for seasonal and      house-brand sales. Thenwhen the cost of a particular item      is right -I buy as large a quantity of the bargain goods as      my money and storage space will allow.    </p>    <p>      If inflation continues ( as it surely will), stocking my      shelves with adequate supplies of staple necessities will      provide me with a great form of one-upmanship against the      rising-price demon.    </p>    <p>      When soaring food costs attacked everyone's budget in      1973-74, for example, I had already purchased supplies t      varying from one to three years' worth, as determined by      each item's perishability) of salad oil, shortening,      syrups, honey, coffee, tea, milk powder, dried beans and      lentils, and sugar for cooking and canning. I'd also bought      stockpiles of canned foods that I can't satisfactorily      process at home . . . such as evaporated milk, tuna,      salmon, pineapple, whole and cream-style corn, and pork and      beans.    </p>    <p>      In addition to food, I had accumulated-at sale prices-a      number of household staples. I bought toilet and facial      tissues, detergents, cleansers, bleaches, and paper towels      by the case . . . and soaps, shampoos, and other personal      hygiene articles by the dozen, which meant that-on some      such necessities-I was able to avoid inflated prices for as      much as three years. (Remember, at its peak, the 197374      inflation rate was 17% annually! So the money used for the      basic items wouldn't have earned nearly as much interest in      a savings account as it did on my pantry shelves!)    </p>    <p>      But even before inflation became a common topic of      conversation, I always tried to keep at least a year's      supply of regularly used provisions on hand . . . since I'd      found-early on-that the savings realized on products bought      on sale always justified such a practice.    </p>    <p>      Since it takes no longer to buy a case than it does to      purchase one item, I also save a tremendous amount of      <em>tine</em> by buying in quantity. Then too, since I live      a good distance from the closest town, my large-scale      purchasing eliminates many miles of travel and thus      conserves gallons of gasoline. (I've <em>never,</em> in      fact, made a special run for a few groceries . . . since I      have my own stockpiled supermarket at home!)    </p>    <h3>      BEATING PRICE INCREASES    </h3>    <p>      When-through my local radio station -I heard that the      federal government had made a priceincreasing deal with      sugar cane growers, I hurriedly stashed away quantities of      sweetener ... <em>before</em> the price rise hit the      supermarkets.    </p>    <p>      When disastrous weather destroyed a major portion of the      cacao bean crop in South America, I replenished my supply      of chocolate items. I'm still using some of the cocoa I      bought then-not on salefor 79 cents a pound. The last time      I checked, the price was $2.15 for eight ounces. ( The      store has actually <em>discontinued pound</em> boxes      because of the high cost! )    </p>    <p>      When a damaging freeze wiped out much of the world's coffee      supply, I bought, as I usually do, two cases of instant      coffee . . . at $2.09 per eight-ounce jar. When I had to      replenish my supply, the price was $4.77 for the same size      and brand. At that time, world coffee supplies were      reported to be moving up soon, so I was careful to purchase      only a few jars . . . hoping to ride the cost down before      buying another case or two on sale.    </p>    <p>      The coffee price rise-and-fall just mentioned illustrates      another important part of my money/time-saving strategy. If      I'm caught short of a particular product between sales-or      when prices are abnormally high-I buy just one or two of      the needed items . . . and wait to refill my shelves when      increased supplies or sales lower the cost again.    </p>    <p>      There may be those who'll consider my method to be a      selfish way of saving money. Hogwash! I can conceive of no      better method of leveling out the wild swings (that seem to      be mostly up!) in the marketplace. Volume buying allows me      to purchase more carefully than I could if I were shopping      day to day . . . or even week to week. Mine is simply a      yearto-year plan . . . nothing more. Certainly, I don't use      any more of the earth's resources than does a more      conventional buyer. (I hope and believe that I use      <em>less.)</em>    </p>    <h3>      COLD STORAGE FOR STAPLES    </h3>    <p>      I store most of my large-scale purchases on pantry or      cellar shelves. In ad dition, my 1948 freezer contains any      sales purchases that require low-storage temperatures,      while my "spare" 1945-model refrigerator is now used to      hold large quantities of crackers, flour, instant milk,      margarine, cornmeal, and cracked wheat. ( Airtight jars      would serve to keep weevils out of such items, but the food      would eventually go stale if stored on a pantry shelf.)    </p>    <p>      During the coldest months of the winter, our garage      provides us with a marvelous walk-in cold-storage facility      . . . in which I keep cases of apples, grapefruit, and      oranges. I also use the garage to store sacks of locally      grown potatoes, yams, onions, and carrots: usually      "unmarketables" that I've scrounged from friends      <em>(and</em> from commercial growers) for little or no      money.    </p>    <h3>      NO MONEY. . . NO PLAN?    </h3>    <p>      I expect that some-perhaps many-of you are thinking: "Hey,      lady! You don't know what it's like out here'. How can we      buy a year's supply of anything when we don't have money      even for next <em>week's</em> groceries?"    </p>    <p>      Well . . . I <em>do</em> know what it's like. During the      first year of my marriage, I spent $1.68 a week for food      and household items. Even if you add the results of 37      years of inflation, I'll bet you'll find that your budget      isn't any more stringent than mine was then.    </p>    <p>      When money is a problem, I suggest you simply start small.      Instead of buying a case on sale, buy two or three cans,      boxes, or packages. When there's extra money (and there      will be if you <em>plan</em> to have W), you can buy a      sale-priced case. Gradually, a little cash should become      available to buy a case of some other sale item, and so on.      You'll soon be well on your way to supporting a full-scale      year-toyear plan . . . with all its conservation of time,      money, and resources.    </p>    <h3>      TIME/MONEY-SAVING GARDENING    </h3>    <p>      It's surely evident to nearly all of you that the list of      supermarket commodities I provided above is rather limited.      That's because our garden and fruit trees fulfill most of      the balance of my family's food needs. Our North Texas farm      is blessed with a climate that's beneficial to nearly all      summer vegetables and fruit . . . so an important part of      our food supply planning involves crop production.    </p>    <p>      However, since growing food can demand an almost unlimited      amount of time, I plan very carefully to conserve that      valued and finite resource. First, I plant late . . .      around May 15th or even. later. More eager neighbors start      seedlings in February and March, and plant in early April.      My late garden, however, avoids competition from early weed      species and much violent spring weather 1 including      hailstones, sandstorms, tornados, etc.) . . . therefore,      the plants grow with less stress.    </p>    <p>      Nor do I buy any plants. My cabbage, tomatoes, and peppers      are seed-sown in the same space they'll occupy during the      entire growing season. Thus, I save money and time,      <em>and</em> I know exactly what variety I'll harvest . . .      which is often <em>not</em> the case with purchased      seedlings.    </p>    <p>      Because the late-planted vegetables encounter less damaging      weather, they're healthier . . . more prolific . . . and      produce longer. I don't mind, therefore, that my first crop      is a week or two later than that of my neighbors.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the cultivated garden, I have several      perennial vegetables set out in protected and/or slightly      shaded spots around the edges of our lawn. A very limited      amount of hand weeding takes care of our beds of garlic,      chives, onion, poke, asparagus, spearmint, and rhubarb . .      . while New Zealand spinach, leaf lettuce, dill weed, and      wild lamb'squarters spring up-voluntarily-from unharvested      seed in sheltered areas.    </p>    <p>      Peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, apples, and a grapevine      are also distributed around the yard. The garden and      orchard represent my own style of minimum-effort gardening.      In fact, very few of my precious spring and summer hours      are used to produce the fruits and vegetables we depend on.    </p>    <h3>      TIME SPENT EXTRAVAGANTLY?    </h3>    <p>      All the bounty harvested from our garden and orchard is      either eaten fresh or preserved for later use. The fruits      are canned for salads and desserts ... or made into      preserves and jellies, delicious pancake syrups, and      fillings for fruit pies (which are frozen and baked later).      Any vitamin-rich fresh fruits that are still around late in      the season are either dried or turned into fruit leathers.    </p>    <p>      Our tomatoes are canned whole or as juice, used to provide      a base for meatrich spaghetti sauce, or processed with      hamburger for meatballs and sauce. Homemade soup      combinations such as tomato, zucchini, and onion-or tomato,      okra, and onion-are prepared to stock our pantry shelves,      too . . . as well as cream-of-tomato soup, ranch-style      beans (a combination of mature, shelled-not dried-pinto      beans and tomatoes, with some chili blend thrown in), and      even tomato preserves and marmalade.    </p>    <p>      We also process supplies of various relishes and sauces      that use tomatoes-ripe or green-as a base. Claliente      sauce-a Tex-Mex distillation of liquid fire made with      tomatoes; onions, and jalapeno peppers-is one of my      specialties. And when time permits, I put up a few bottles      of' ketchup and barbecue sauce and tomato sauce. (This year      I plan to dry some slices of these luscious globes, which      I'll later pulverize for instant additions to soups and      casseroles.)    </p>    <p>      Many of our other crops are as versatile as are tomatoes,      so my pantry is a true storehouse of nature's resources.      However-even at today's inflated prices-if I measured the      value of the homeprocessed food in money only, there might      be no way to justify the lavish amount of time I spend on      it. But I use another measurement: the <em>quality</em> of      the finished products.    </p>    <p>      My stored food's excellence is assured in a number of ways:      For one thing, chemicals are never applied to our soil or      to the plants that <em>produce</em> our fruits and      vegetables. All of the crops are harvested at peak      perfection and immediately processed to preserve as much of      their natural nutrition as possible. Furthermore, the      preservation itself meets my demanding requirements for      sanitation, andeven more important-I use no artificial      preservatives. Therefore, I <em>know</em> what our family      and friends are eating when they dine at our table. So, I      balance that knowledge along with the cash and time      invested . . . and consider my hours well-spent.    </p>    <h3>      ECONOMICAL CONSUMPTION    </h3>    <p>      The ultimate test of a year-to-year food plan is      <em>using</em> the goods in an economical manner. It's      always possible, of course, to "throw more out the back      door than can be brought in the front", unless you continue      to plan carefully <em>after you</em> buy.    </p>    <p>      When you serve a roast, for instance, remember the      proverbial hog butcher who uses everything but the squeal.      Leftover meat and drippings can provide a head start in      creating a delicious, nutritious, stomach-filling casserole      . . . and the leftover casserole can serve as a basis for a      tasty, full-bodied soup. Even after that you can store the      remaining soup in the freezer, then-on a time short, busy      day-take it from its arctic repository and serve it up with      hot corn bread . . . no one will notice that you've used,      reused, and used again the original roast. Now . . . if      you'd like to know what to do with the remaining leftovers      of the leftovers of the leftovers, use your imagination      before adding them finally to the diets of your      miscellaneous animals.    </p>    <p>      So you see, only your vision and determination need limit      your conservative use of food . . . which is, after all,      'one of the earth's scarcest resources. (The same limits,      of course, apply to the wise use of the world's entire      natural wealth.)    </p>    <p>      And, on a personal basis, commonsense planning means money      in your pocket, food on the table, and security in the      pantry . . . for whatever hard times may come.    </p>
