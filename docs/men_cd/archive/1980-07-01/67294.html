                    <p>      <strong>A little ingenuity: How B.J. Megnin does without      public utilities!</strong>    </p>    <p>      How would you like to live free of power poles and light      bills . . . yet still have electric lights, television, a      water pump, and more for a total energy cost of around $15      a month? Well, impossible as it sounds, that's just what my      family is doing!    </p>        <p>      My wife and I worked for several years and saved both our      money <em>and</em> every single issue of MOTHER-in      preparation for our move back to the land . . . which      finally took place in September 1978.    </p>    <p>      We bought 120 acres in the very rough timber country of      northeastern Alabama (maybe 20 of our acres are flat enough      for cultivation) called Rocky Hollow. There are no springs      or creeks for hydropower on our land . . . we seldom have      enough breeze to run a windmill ... and we're more than a      mile from the nearest power pole. But we've found that      enjoying the luxury of electricity deep in the woods      doesn't have to be a big problem at all!    </p>    <h3>      AC/DC AT OUR DISPOSAL    </h3>    <p>      Our home energy system began with the purchase of a 120-240      volt alternator (it's a Sears 4,000-watt model) and a used,      1976 Ford Pinto engine. Then, using a steel bracket, I      mounted the alternator so it could be driven by the      engine's fan belt (see Photo 1). The setup provides 120 and      240 volts AC whenever we need it, which is for a 15 minute      period every other day . . . to run the well pump.    </p>        <p>      When the pump <em>isn't</em> in operation, we use the      12-volt DC that's produced by the engine. To do so, I      simply replaced the Pinto's single small battery with four      larger units in parallel and the auto's alternator keeps      our battery bank fully charged.    </p>    <p>      Next, we ran underground cable (two conductor No. 10 wires)      from the batteries in the "powerhouse" to the switchbox in      our mobile home, and hooked it up as though it were 110      volts from a powerline. However, we first had to remove      all! the light sockets in the house and replace them with      12-volt sockets (Stock No. 60F1308, Type 11-271), which we      ordered from Newark Electronics (Dept. TMEN, 500 North      Pulaski Road, Chicago, Illinois 60624). We then inserted      12-volt bulbs into the sockets (also from Newark      Electronics, Stock No. 27F193, Type 1141). By placing a      light over each critical area (the sink, stove, etc.), we      can have nice, bright illumination ... whenever and      wherever we need it.    </p>    <p>      Now perhaps you're thinking, "Fine they have 12-volt lights      but what about television, stereo, etc.? Such amenities      won't work on 12 volts."    </p>    <p>      Well, <em>most</em> of them won't, I'll grant you . . . but      in this day of recreational vehicles and electronic      wizardry, you can find 12-voli television sets--black      and-white or color-very readily (Sears, Ward's, and Western      Auto all sell them). The same is true of stereo systems.      (We've found that a relatively inexpensive Datsun tape      deck, with a couple of decent speakers, does just fine.)    </p>    <p>      Here's another example of how we put modernday electronic      wizardry to work on our homestead: We bought (far $57) a      new 200-watt inverter, a device that converts 12-volt DC      into 120-volt AC . . . and anytime we need a <em>small</em>      amount of the latter "juice" (such as for our electronic      organ, small appliances, or whatever), we just turn on the      inverter and plug into it.    </p>    <h3>      NOTEWORTHY NUMBERS    </h3>    <p>      Now let's get down to some of the dry statistics . . .      which aren't boring to us a' all, because they involve what      we paid <em>and</em> what we got! The Sears alternator cost      less than $400 . . . the Pinto engine: $275 . . . the      battery bank: $280 . . . and the wir ing, sockets, bulbs,      and miscellaneous about $100. It all adds up to a grand      total of just over $1,000 for our complete power system.      (Notice that-if we didn't need a fairly large quantity of      240 volt AC power for the well pump we could get by without      the $400 alternator.)    </p>    <p>      As mentioned above, we usually run the plant every other      day. I start it, set the throttle to just above a fast idle      (approximately 1,200 RPM) and let it run for an hour.      During this period the car's alternator is putting about 35      amps of current into the battery bank. Then I throttle the      engine up to 2,200 RPM, which is probably (I'm guessing)      the equivalent of 35-40 MPH in a car ... <em>and just</em>      the speed required to drive the big alternator at 3,600      RPM, to provide the approximately 15 minutes of the      60-cycle-per-second, 240 volts needed by our submersible      well pump.    </p>    <p>      When I switch on the pump, the water goes into a 250-gallon      storage tank atop a 30-foot tower (Photo 2). Within 10 to      20 minutes the tank is full, and I can turn the system off.      During that short operating time, however, the car      alternator runs at full capacity (about 60 amps) and      charges the battery bank, if needed. (The auto voltage      regulator takes care of all that.)    </p>    <p>      Better yet, during the whole hour-and-a-quarter period, the      engine consumes less than a gallon of gasoline. Call it a      dollar's worth of fuel 15 times monthly . . . or $15 a      month!    </p>    <h3>      HOT WATER, TOO!    </h3>    <p>      Here's the best trick of all! Our Pinto power plant like      all internal combustion engines produces some noise, a      small amount of useful power, and a whale of a lot of heat.      In fact, the warmth generated accounts for approximately      75% of the fuel's energy . . . and we manage to recover      more than halt of what is generally wasted heat.    </p>    <p>      Instead of using a radiator on the engine, you see, we      circulate the hot water through a well insulated,      500-gallon tank (it's an old butane container) that's      enclosed in a weatherproof box. About 60 gallons of      180Â°F water go into the tank each time I run the      engine. (That amounts to approximately 50,000 BTU, if you      want to get technical about it.) A coil of copper tubing      carries the water from the well through the heated water in      the top of this tank, and then into the hot water      distribution lines in our mobile home. Presto . . .      steaming showers!    </p>    <h3>      ENERGY INDEPENDENCE    </h3>    <p>      So there you have the Rocky Hollow Energy System. It's      nothing new and nothing fancy . . . but it's here now, it's      ours, and it works! We get power for heat, lights, warm      water, television, stereo, the electronic organ, and even      our blender . . . for $15 per month. Of course, we're not      using as much electricity as we did during our "city" days      . . . but we have all we need, and for our requirements the      price of the Rocky Hollow Energy System can't be beat!    </p>    <p>      PHOTOS BY THE AUTHOR    </p>
