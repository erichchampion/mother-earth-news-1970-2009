    <p>
                <p>      Buy two 4 x 8 sheets of 1/4" plywood, and you can start      this rewarding winter workship project.    </p>            <p>      There aren't too many homesites in North America that      aren't within easy driving distance of a good-sized body of      water, So it's a safe bet that those of you who don't own a      boat had, over the past summer, occasion to wish you did.      And there are several reasons why <em>right now</em> would      be a good time to begin a boat-building project.    </p>    <p>      For one, the winter months ahead will provide some freedom      form the constant demands of yard and garden work ( and      from the tempetation to simply be outdoor in fine weather)      and thus should allow plenty of time for the      slow-and-steady woodworkers among us to have our hand-built      watercraft ready for launch next spring. In addition, if      you decide to buckle down and get right to this project,      you'll be able to have a special Christmas gift ready to      give a watersmitten youngster . . . or a fine little      fowling boat for your own winter duck hunts.    </p>        <p>      You shouldn't find MOTHER's dinghy too difficult to      construct. Research staffers Dennis Burkholder and Clarence      Goosen built the brightly painted beauty shown here in just      four days . . . and most of that time was spent waiting for      glue to dry!    </p>    <p>      Your first task will be to collect two 4' X 8' sheets of      1/4" marine plywood (we used a less expensive plywood when      building the two prototypes used to refine our design, and      those boats have held up well so far, but we can't make any      estimate of their long-term reliability), about 160 feet of      3/4" X 1-1/8" flexible, clear-grained hardwood (we      recommend oak, and ripped our strips from ten-foot 3/4" X      8" boards), a foot or so of 3/4" X 8" hardwood for the      motor-mount brace (you'll measure it for exact fit later),      about 500 No. 6 X 3/4" brass wood screws, two dozen No. 8 X      1-1/2" brass wood screws (nickle-plated fasteners can also      be used), and a supply of plastic resin glue.    </p>        <p>      To begin, scribe a centerline down each sheet of plywood      (it'll serve as a reference point for several of the      measurements to come). Then go on to mark the cutting lines      for one of the boat's sides. To do so, select a long,      straight-grained strip of 1-1/8" X 3/4" hardwood to use as      a straightedge. (Keep this strip separate, because the same      one should be used to draw the curves for the boat's bottom      later.) Clamp its center to one of your plywood sheets,      placing the clamp about 1/8" in from the edge at a point 3'      6-1/2" from one end (that end will be the boat's stern).      Then, with a friend's help, bend the hardwood into a bow,      clamping it so that its outer edges intersect the edges of      the plywood 3" from the corner in the stern and 5-1/8" from      the corner in the bow. With that done, scribe a line along      the outer surface of the hardwood strip.    </p>        <p>      Next, you'll want to draw the upper edge of the boat's      side. To do so, mark the clamp positions as in the      accompanying illustration, then-using a bar clamp      positioned 3' 6-1/2" from the stern end-secure the      hardwood strip with its outer edge 1'3-1/4" from the edge      of the plywood, clamp the ends of the strip as marked, and      trace the line. Now mark the angles of the bow and stern as      shown, cut out the side, and flop it over to use as a      pattern for the boat's other side. (It's best to draw in      the patterns for the bow and stern transoms, allowing room      for the four corner pieces, before doing any more cutting,      to make sure all of the components will fit on the one      plywood sheet.)    </p>    <p>      Now, going to the <em>other</em> plywood sheet, use your      hardwood strip "ruler" to draw the boat's bottom, employing      the same bend-and trace technique used when drawing the      sides. Then cut the bottom out, leaving a surplus of 1-1/2"      to 2" around the pattern on the sides and at the bow (it'll      be trimmed away later).    </p>    <p>      With that done, you can cut out the second side and the      transoms and also draw and cut out the central support      frame. Then glue and screw the hardwood support strips, and      the cut-to-fit motor-mount brace, to the front and rear      transoms and the central support, using No. 6 X 3/4" wood      screws set at 3" intervals. (The upper support strips for      the front and rear transoms will have to be trimmed to      match the angles of the bow and stern. To do so, simply use      a sliding bevel to measure the appropriate angle on the      bottom panel-use the pattern lines, not the      "hem"-then set your saw's miter gauge to that angle      and trim away.)    </p>    <p>      In the next step, use glue and 3"-spaced No. 6 X 3/4" wood      screws to secure the two sides to the central support      frame, which should be positioned 3' 6-1/2" from the boat's      stern. Then swing in the sides and, starting with the stern      transom (you might want to loop a rope around the two sides      at a point near the front to keep them from spreading too      much while you do this), glue and screw the sides to the      stern transom support frame-again setting the screws      at 3" intervals. Now go on to secure the sides to the bow      transom in the same manner, and let the glue dry for its      full recommended period of time.    </p>    <p>      At this point, we come to the only really awkward part of      the construction process. After the glue has dried, you'll      have to beg, borrow, or buy at least 20 clamps to secure      the hardwood support strips to the bottom edges of the two      sides. Cut the strips to length, leaving a 6" overhang on      each end, and then start each one-at the      stern-by running a No. 8 X 1-1/2" wood screw through      it and into the transom support frame. Then-working      with a helper and using glue and 3/4" wood screws set at 3"      intervals-bend, fasten, and clamp both strips in      place a bit at a time. (A brace and bit, and predrilled      pilot holes, will make this task go quickly.) Secure the      far ends of each strip with 1-1/2" screws, and when the      adhesive has thoroughly dried, trim the ends of the strips      and plane them flush with the bottom of the plywood.    </p>    <p>      When the next step's completed, your boat will begin to      look like a water-worthy craft. Now's the time to invert      the sides-and-transoms assembly and to glue and screw the      bottom in place. Once that's done, you can go on to install      the bottom support strips, using the overlapping bottom      "hem" to clamp them in place as you glue and screw them      down (these 3/4" screws are inserted from the      <em>inside</em> of the boat).    </p>    <p>      Later, after waiting for the previously added pieces to dry      in place, you can trim off the excess plywood on the      bottom, flip the boat over, and attach the gunwales (top      support strips) to the upper edge of each side, employing      the multiple clamps to attach the two gunwales      simultaneously as you did when installing the lower side      support strips.    </p>    <p>      And, finally, it's time for the finishing touches. Take      your scrap of plywood, and using the sliding bevel to get      the angles right, draw and cut out the four corner braces.      Secure strips of hardwood brace to these at the points at      which they'll be fastened to the boat. Bring the sliding      bevel into play again, this time to measure the slope of      the boat's sides and transoms at the appropriate points,      then set your miter gauge to the indicated angle and rip      the support strips before gluing and screwing them into      place.    </p>    <p>      You'll have to use the sliding bevel once more to fit the      bow seat support in place; then run a strip of hardwood      from it, allowing the strip to rest on the central support      brace, to mark the correct height for the stern seat      support. With that done, go on to assemble the      hardwood-strip seat as shown in the detail drawing, leaving      off one of the side braces so you'll be able to paint the      interior of the boat and slip some polystyrene flotation      blocks beneath the seat. (Simply attach the remaining side      brace to hold the foam in position,)    </p>    <p>      We used three coats of urethane floor enamel (about one      gallon total) to paint our skiff: However, a primer coat of      Thompson's Water Seal (or a similar product) would      certainly be a worthwhile investment, especially if you      elect to experiment with a less expensive grade of plywood.    </p>    <p>      Once the paint has dried and you've positioned your      oarlocks (we've found them to work best when the holes are      centered 7-1/4" behind the center support brace), grab a      pair of oars and a life preserver, head for the nearest      lake, pond, bay, or slow-moving river, and discover, as      Water Rat noted in <em>The Wind in the Willows,</em> that      "there is <em>nothing-abso</em> lutely      nothing-half so much worth doing as simply messing      about in boats."    </p><hr />    <p>      If you'd like a bit more help with your boatbuilding      project than we've been able to present in these three      pages, you'll be pleased to know that we're preparing a set      of detailed plans for both the boat and the sail unit that      will be featured in our next issue. You can order a set,      for $10.00 plus $1.00 shipping and handling, by writing to      Boat Plans, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> PLANS, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, NC 28793.    </p>    <p>      COMING UP:    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's researchers are fine- tuning the simple clamp-on      sail rig shown in the accompanying photos. This little      breeze-fueled power plant-which can be used with any      small, square-sterned craft, and which shouldn't cost more      than $45 to assemble-will be described in detail in      MOTHER NO. 96.    </p>
