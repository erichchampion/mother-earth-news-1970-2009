                <p>      Thinking about putting some (or some more) insulation in      your attic? This guide can help.    </p>            <p>      Although installing insulation in an unheated attic is      usually a fairly straightforward job, a variety of pitfalls      await the unwary. So, with cold weather approaching in most      parts of the country, we present this Chamber of Horrors of      atticinsulation mistakes, maladies, and oversights. Look it      over, and then pay a critical visit to your own      attic-if you dare.    </p>    <h3>      Vent Areas Blocked in the Eaves    </h3>        <p>      Don't push batt or blanket insulation past the top plate at      the end of joist runs . . . or fold it back and up between      the rafters . . . or pour fill insulation into such areas.      If you do, you'll obstruct the flow of air from soft-it      vents (or, in older homes, from gaps between the outer wall      and the roof). In fact, if your roof's pitch is steep      enough to allow access to the eaves, you can install a      slanted-board baffle at the end of each joist run to      prevent insulation from clogging the area.    </p>    <h3>      Holes and Gaps in the Attic Floor    </h3>    <p>      Fill in the extra space around openings where pipes, ducts,      and wires enter the attic floor, using unfaced fiberglass      or caulk. Caulk nail and drill holes, as well.    </p>    <h3>      Recessed Lighting Fixtures Covered with      Insulation    </h3>        <p>      Recessed lighting fixtures that are covered with insulation      become extremely hot and present a serious fire hazard. So      maintain a minimum clearance of three inches between      recessed fixtures and any kind of insulation. Be      particularly careful when using poured or blown-in      cellulose, which over time can drift onto recessed      fixtures. Yes, open spaces do allow some heat to enter the      attic, but the cost of the wasted heat is nothing compared      to that of a fire. Furthermore, there is an alternative:      Replace the fixtures with flush-mounted lighting.    </p>    <h3>      Vapor Barrier Placed Wrong Side Up    </h3>        <p>      Install foil- or paper-faced insulation with the <em>facing      side down.</em> If the facing is up, moisture will become      trapped in your insulation and turn it into an ineffective      mess. If you use loose-fill insulation, you may need to      install a vapor barrier of polyethylene sheeting between      each joist run before you pour the material, or to coat the      interior ceiling below with a vapor-retardant paint.    </p>    <h3>      Faced Insulation Used for a Second Layer    </h3>    <p>      If you decide to add a second layer of insulation, use only      loose-fill or unfaced fiberglass. Placing a vapor barrier      on top of the original insulation will trap moisture and      render the first layer ineffective. If you can buy only      faced bans or blankets in your area, peel the backing off      before installing the new insulation over the old.    </p>    <h3>      Possible Overinsulation    </h3>        <p>      If you already have at least six inches of insulating      material in your attic, you'd probably be wise to take      other energy-saving measures (caulking and      weather-stripping doors and windows, installing insulation      around heating ducts and in unheated crawl spaces, etc.)      <em>before</em> investing in a second layer of attic      insulation. Many energy analysts say the first four to six      inches of attic insulation are ten times more      cost-effective than the second four to six inches; in other      words, for every fuel dollar you saved when you installed      the first layer, you'll save only about a dime by adding      another layer.    </p>    <h3>      Insulation Compressed and Stuffed into Tight Areas    </h3>        <p>      It's the air trapped in insulation, rather than the      material itself, that resists the passage of heat. When      laying batts or blankets in place, push down on them only      lightly-just enough to get a snug fit between joists.      In areas where there is cross bridging, or where the space      between two joists is unusually narrow, take the time to      cut the insulation to the size needed; don't just stuff it      into the space. If your attic has a lot of cross bridging      or hard-to-fit spaces, fill insulation may be a better      choice than bans or blankets.    </p>	 <h3>Gaps and Puckers in Batt/Blanket Insulation</h3>       <p>      Be sure to install batts or blankets with care, leaving no      open space on either side or at the point where two      sections butt together. Before laying the insulation, look      for rips and tears in the facing and repair them with tape.    </p>		<h3>Loose Fill Insulation near Attic Fan</h3>        <p>      Poured or blown insulation is subject to shifting and will      almost surely drift out of place when used near an attic      fan, creating bare or sparsely insulated floor areas. Use      batts or blankets in such areas instead.    </p>    <h3>      Animal Nests</h3>        <p>      If you hear critters scurrying about in your attic, they've      probably set up housekeeping somewhere in your      insulation-and may very well have cleared sizable,      heat-leaking openings in the material. Evict the offenders,      repair the damage, and try to find and block or screen off      all entryways.    </p>    <h3>      Mold and Mildew, Rusty Roofing Nails    </h3>        <p>      These symptoms suggest that your attic isn't adequately      ventilated-a condition that causes insulation to      become wet (and therefore worthless) and, ultimately, leads      to wood rot in roof decking and framing. Replace any matted      insulation, check to be sure all vents are clear, and      install additional roof or gable vents if necessary.    </p>    <p>      Most experts recommend a <em>minimum</em> of one square      foot of free vent area for every 300 square feet of attic      floor space. Ideally, 50% of the venting is positioned low      at the eaves, and the remaining 50% higher, at the roof,      ridge, or gable ends. If you have air-conditioning or live      in a humid region, or if you've elected not to use a vapor      barrier between your ceiling and attic insulation, you'll      need twice as much venting-a minimum of one square      foot for every 150 square feet of attic floor.    </p>    <h3>      Uninsulated Attic Hatch    </h3>    <p>      Before you cast an approving eye over your new insulation      job and climb out of the attic, be sure to cover the hatch      itself with rigid foam board insulation or a leftover      fiberglass bats, cut to size and glued in place. It's also      a good idea to put adhesive-backed foam weather stripping      around the inside of the molding that the trap door rests      on when it's closed, or to simply seal around the door with      duct tape.    </p>    <h3>      Installer Tired, Impatient, Uncomfortable    </h3>        <p>      Insulating an attic can be hot, unpleasant work in cramped      quarters, but since the care with which you install your      insulation is as important as the insulation itself, it      pays not to rush through the job. To make things easier,      insulate only on cool, cloudy days. Fear gloves,      loose-fitting clothing, a dust mask, andif you wear contact      lenses-safety goggles. Take frequent breaks. And when you      finish for the day, take a hot shower followed by a cold      rinse, to flush insulation fibers from your skin and pores.    </p>    <p>      <em>For an overview of the various kinds of home insulation      and their applications, see "Know Your Insulation" on pages      54 through 56 of MOTHER NO. 78. An excellent and sensible      manual on costconscious home energy conservation</em> is      Stop Burning Your Money: The Intelligent Homeowner's Guide      to Household Energy Savings, <em>by John Rothchild (Random.      House; $15.50).</em>    </p>    <h3>      Is Your Attic Well Insulated? Here's an Easy Test.    </h3>        <p>      Researchers at the Center for Energy and Environmental      Studies at Princeton University have devised a simple way      for you to determine whether excessive amounts of heat are      leaking into your attic.    </p>    <p>      Climb up into your attic on a cold winter evening and leave      a thermometer there for an hour or so. Then note the      reading and compare it to [1] the outside temperature and      [2] the temperature downstairs in your living quarters. If      your attic is more than 10Â° F warmer than the outdoor      temperature, or if it's closer to the temperature inside      than outside, you can figure something's amiss.    </p>    <p>      That doesn't necessarily mean, however, that you don't have      enough insulation in your attic-any of the other      problems outlined in this article could be the source of      the heat loss. Check for installation flaws and heat leaks      first-then consider adding new insulation.    </p>
