                <p>      Modern agriculture is rushing us into an unintended but      dangerous form of genetic engineering.    </p>         <p><strong>Antibiotics and Meat</strong></p>        <p>      Nowadays, it's so simple and inexpensive to take an oral      dose of tetracycline or amoxicillin to fight off an      infection that most of us take antibiotics for granted. The      time may be rapidly approaching, however, when we'll have      to learn what it's like to do without these drugs . . . in      large part because of the way American agribusiness raises      meat!    </p>    <h3>      ANTIBIOTICS    </h3>    <p>      To understand this bizarre connection, we'll need to review      the nature of antibiotics themselves. Antibiotics are      chemicals derived from the toxins one microorganism      generates to fight off the assault of another.    </p>    <p>      Though we know that the Chinese used moldy bean curd to      treat carbuncles and boils several millennia ago, it wasn't      until 1928 that Sir Alexander Fleming discovered that a      mold, penicillin, actually killed competing bacteria. When      penicillin was synthesized in useful, therapeutic      concentrations in 1941, many infectious diseases that had      been practically uncontrollable finally became treatable.      Between 1943 and 1960, the annual production of penicillin      soared-from 29 pounds to 860,000 pounds-and the      fatality rates associated with various diseases plummeted.    </p>    <p>      Truly, the description "wonder drugs" aptly reflected the      early success of antibiotics in treating disease. For the      first time, doctors had medicine that actually attacked the      cause of bacterial disease. However, not long after      antibiotics began to see widespread use, scientists      discovered an alarming trend. Some bacteria were developing      resistance to antibiotics . . . they were effectively      selecting for a stronger strain of microorganism! And these      resistant bacteria could run rampant when a constant      barrage of wonder drugs wiped out their nonresistant      competitors.    </p>    <p>      It was another decade, though, before the full effects of      bacterial resistance to antibiotics were felt. In 1968,      <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em> (a virulent strain of      dysentery) broke out in Guatemala and spread throughout      Central America over the course of three years. Doctors      assumed that they were dealing with amoebic dysentery when      the four antibiotics of choice-streptomycin,      tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfonamide-had no      effect. By the time the real cause, resistant bacteria, was      discovered, tens of thousands had died.    </p>    <h3>      HOW BACTERIA BECOME RESISTANT    </h3>    <p>      Part of the reason that it took so long to recognize the      significance and extent of bacterial resistance to      antibiotics is that no one anticipated the means by which      resistance is passed from one cell to another. If resistant      strains developed only through the reproduction of strong      survivors and chromosomal mutation-as was initially      assumed-it would take a long time for large cultures      of resistant bacteria to develop.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, as Japanese researchers discovered in the      late 1950s and early 1960s, bacteria have a much more      efficient means of transmitting resistance. Dr. Tsutomo      Watanabe found that, in the case of some microbes, drug      resistance could be passed from one bacterium to another in      the form of R (resistance) plasmids, pieces of DNA not      directly linked to or affecting the chromosome. These      plasmids, which can number up to 2,000 per cell, are      directly transferred from cell to cell, through a      connection called a pilus, without otherwise affecting the      donor or recipient. Thus, instead of facing the extended      process of mutation (a probability of less than 1 in      10,000,000) and natural selection, resistance DNA can be      passed from one group of cells to another in a matter of      minutes. What's more, the bacteria involved need not be of      the same species; for example, <em>Escherichia coli</em> (a      prevalent intestinal bacterium) readily becomes resistant      and transfers that resistance to salmonella or <em>Shigella      dysenteriae.</em>    </p>    <h3>      CONCERN SPREADS    </h3>    <p>      In the December 1967 issue of <em>Scientific American,</em>      Dr. Watanabe wrote, "Unless we put a halt to the prodigal      use of antibiotics and synthetic drugs, we may soon be      forced back into a pre-antibiotic era." It was an outcry      that few heeded at the time. But by 1982, the      <em>Lancet</em> reported that 90% of <em>Staphylococcus      aureus</em> bacteria (which infect surgical incisions) were      resistant to penicillin and that 35% of <em>E. coli</em>      were resistant to ampicillin.    </p>    <p>      Though doctors and scientists don't agree about the      severity of the problem, many physicians are now exercising      restraint in prescribing antibiotics. For example, the use      of antibiotics for cold and flu viruses, against which they      are entirely ineffective, has practically ended. Doctors      have recognized that antibiotics are a depletable resource      that needs to be saved for really serious health problems.      Meanwhile, new (and much more expensive) antibiotics are      under development to replace those that have become      ineffective. But trying to keep up with the expanding      inventory of resistant bacteria is a constant battle.    </p>    <h3>      ANTIBIOTICS AND LIVESTOCK    </h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, even if all physicians exercised thorough      restraint in the use of antibiotics, there would still be a      tremendous influx of these substances into the environment.      Nearly half the volume of antibiotics produced in the U. S.      each year-about 15,000,000 pounds, worth almost      $250,000,000-is fed to animals. Penicillin,      tetracycline, and other such medications are routinely      mixed into the feed of the majority of livestock in this      country . . . not mainly to stave off disease but, instead,      in efforts to increase <em>growth</em> rates.    </p>    <p>      In 1949, Dr. Thomas Jukes-who then worked for Lederle      Laboratories, the company that discovered chlortetracycline      (Aureomycin)found that feeding the wastes from the      production of chlortetracycline to baby chickens increased      their growth rate by 10 to 20%. Continued research showed      that the effect was at least as pronounced on piglets and      calves. Companies such as American Cyanamid (the parent of      Lederle and the largest producer of veterinary      tetracycline) claim that giving doses of antibiotics well      below those that would be used to treat disease (a      procedure called subtherapeutic administration) can return      $3.00 in improved feed-conversion efficiency for every      dollar invested.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Jukes' discovery did much to make a whole new sort of      farming possible. Antibiotics have made it more practical      to confine animals where they can be fed controlled doses      of commercial feeds, rather than allowing them to range.      And, because of the medicinal properties of the      antibiotics, animals can be <em>kept</em> in such crowded      conditions without serious outbreaks of disease.      Antibiotic-supplemented rations have made possible the      modern-day feedlot . . . an efficient method of raising      fowl, pigs, or cattle that has done much to make the small,      low-intensity family farm uneconomic.    </p>    <p>      At the same time, the volume of antibiotics and their      by-product, resistant bacteria, has burgeoned. According to      an Office of Technology Assessment report in 1979, 99% of      all poultry, 70% of beef cattle and veal, and 90% of swine      receive routine subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics. It's      now nearly impossible to find livestock that don't have      significant populations of resistant bacteria, whether or      not they've actually been fed antibiotics. The resistant      strains quickly pass from one animal to another in      confinement and have even been reported to mysteriously      travel several hundred yards between pens.    </p>    <h3>      THE ANIMAL-HUMAN LINK    </h3>        <p>      Those groups opposed to, and those in favor of,      subtherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock spent most      of the 1960s and '70s arguing about whether resistant      bacteria developed in animal populations could be      transferred to and infect humans. Today it's fairly clear      that this does happen, but there's still much argument      about how widespread the problem is.    </p>    <p>      Most bacteria present in cattle, for example, don't seem to      do well in humans . . . each species has its own set of      microorganisms well adapted to their particular      environment. An exception, however, is the genus      <em>Salmonella,</em> with its ten common species. In      England, a rash of 305 cases of <em>Salmonella      typhimurium</em> in the '60s and early '70s-an      outbreak that resulted in the deaths of two adults and a      child-led that country to ban subtherapeutic use of      antibiotics. In 1976, there was a <em>Salmonella      heidelberg</em> outbreak in Connecticut. The bacteria were      found in calves, then in the farmer who kept the calves,      then in his pregnant daughter, then in his daughter's baby      three days after birth, and finally in other babies kept in      the same hospital nursery. At the time, it wasn't possible      to prove the existence of a direct path for the salmonella      from the calves to the babies in the nursery, but the      circumstantial evidence was very strong.    </p>    <p>      The most heralded example of salmonella transfer from      livestock to humans-the one that seems finally to      have proven the link to most scientists'      satisfaction-occurred two years ago but has only      recently received much publicity. A Minnesota couple became      seriously ill after taking penicillin for a cold and were      found to be infected by a resistant strain of      <em>Salmonella newport.</em> A Centers for Disease Control      researcher, Dr. Scott Holmberg, was brought in and used a      new technique called genetic fingerprinting to track the      salmonella to hamburger, back through a supermarket, and      finally to a South Dakota farm where a herd of cattle was      being fed subtherapeutic doses of chlortetracycline.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Holmberg eventually traced the same strain of      <em>Salmonella newport</em> to 18 other peo ple in four      states. Eleven had been hospitalized, and one had died.      Most of the infected people had handled the meat from the      farm before it was cooked. Salmonella are killed by      heat-as yet, there's little evidence that eating      cooked meat from livestock raised on antibiotics is <em>in      itself</em> unhealthy-but the bacteria are so      virulent that they were able to enter the bodies of the      people who had prepared or otherwise come in contact with      the raw meat. What's more, 12 of the 18 had been taking      penicillin or other antibiotics for cold symptoms.    </p>    <p>      After 25 years of effort, the mechanisms that had long been      suspected were established: Antibiotics fed to animals had      created a resistant strain of bacteria for which the      fatality rate in humans was 21 times higher than for non      resistant strains . . . and antibiotics taken directly by      the people had cleared the way for the disease-causing      microorganisms.    </p>    <h3>      THE OVERRIDING CONCERN    </h3>    <p>      As alarming as it is that diseases made resistant by      antibiotics can be transferred from animals to people, that      threat to human health may be small compared with the      possibility-indeed, the likelihood-that      antibiotics are gradually becoming ineffective treatments      for many diseases as resistance is transferred from one      type of bacteria to another.    </p>    <p>      When England banned subtherapeutic use of antibiotics, the      decision was based in part on a study showing that while      30% of <em>Salmonella typhimurium</em> were resistant in      1963, fully 73% had become resistant by 1979. A more      alarming fact is that even if animals are fed only one      antibiotic, their bacterial cultures may develop resistance      to a variety of other antibiotics at the same time. Today      in the U.S. approximately 25% of the salmonella infections      in humans are resistant to drugs.    </p>    <p>      It may be that the overprescribing of antibiotics for      people bears a similar responsibility for the development      of resistant strains of bacteria, but the fact remains that      the use of antibiotics in animals certainly <em>adds</em>      to the problem. Though most of the bacteria that inhabit a      cow's intestinal tract are different from those that live      in humans, there's no distinguishable difference between      the carriers of resistance: the R plasmids. Even though E.      coli from cattle may be expelled by humans within a day,      these able carriers of resistance can work numerous      transfers during their stay. The routes of travel are      mind-boggling, and the bacteria's persistence is      remarkable. Some of us may bear a bigger burden of R      plasmids than others, but it's safe to say that nearly all      of us have some . . . and that the number is increasing.    </p>    <h3>      REGULATORY STONEWALL    </h3>    <p>      North American countries stand practically alone among      developed nations in allowing the indiscriminate use of      antibiotics in animals. Czechoslovakia, Denmark, England,      the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and West Germany all      require veterinary prescriptions for animal antibiotics. In      the U.S., however, the director of the FDA's Center for      Veterinary Medicine, Lester M. Crawford, has been      unsuccessfully pursuing a ban on subtherapeutic use of      antibiotics since 1977. It seems that each year since 1979      the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee has      written a clause into the FDA budget which specifically      prohibited the agency from restricting antibiotic use in      animals until further research was completed!    </p>    <p>      The last of the research work requested, a study of food      poisoning in Seattle from poultry that was fed antibiotics,      was finished early this year. There now seems to be little      question that routinely feeding antibiotics to animals      presents a threat to human health. The remaining question      is, What exerts more pressure in Congress-corporate      pharmaceutical and farming interests, or a cry of public      outrage? Let Representative Jamie Whitten, Chairman, House      Appropriations Committee, 2362 Rayburn H.O.B., Washington,      DC 20515, know what you think.    </p>    <p>      As of July 1, 1985, the FDA had taken no direct action to      restrict the subtherapeutic use of antibiotics in      livestock. However, two bills have been introduced in      Congress. H.R. 616 would prohibit the use of antibiotics      that increase the resistance of pathogenic bacteria. H.R.      2379 would restrict the importation of meat from      antibiotic-treated animals.    </p>
