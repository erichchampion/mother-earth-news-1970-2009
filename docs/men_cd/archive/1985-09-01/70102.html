                <p>      <em>Creator of All Good Things. . .<br /></em> <em>We thank      you</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>for the beauty of the plant,<br />      for the strength of its healing,<br />      for the goodness of its color,<br />      for the strength of its smell,<br />      and the cleanness of its spirit.</em>    </p>    <p>      - <em>from</em> Song of the Seven Herbs <em>, by</em>      <em>Walking Night Bear</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Olivia Boyce Abel    </h5>    <p>      In the last issue, I told you about seven of my favorite      medicinal herbs: comfrey, echinacea, garlic, angelica,      valerian, chamomile, and calendula. I described how to grow      them, each one's medicinal functions, and an array of      ways-such as in teas, poultices, and oils-to      use them.    </p>    <p>      This time around, I'm going to share how to make my      favorite forms of herbal remedies-tinctures and      salves. While I still steep teas and make poultices when      need be, more and more these days I'm using the medicines      I'll describe in this article. I like herbal remedies that      are already made up, because they're so easy to use when      I'm sick. (There's nothing worse than having to fix up an      elaborate preparation when you're hardly able to get out of      bed!)    </p>    <p>      What's more, tinctures and salves last much longer than      dried leaves, flowers, or roots stored in bottles. I can      make up a batch of rosemary headache tincture or      all-purpose healing salve that will last me three or four      years. Actually, my homemade medicines <em>would</em> last      that long, except for one thing: So many other people find      them useful that I end up giving a lot of them away! Try      out some of the following preparations      yourself-you'll soon see what I mean.    </p>    <h3>      TINCTURES    </h3>    <p>      Tinctures are highly concentrated liquid extracts of herbs.      (Don't get these confused with commercially available fluid      extracts or essential oils. Those are made through a      process of multiple solvent extraction and are up to      <em>ten</em> times as potent as homemade tinctures.)    </p>    <p>      To make a tincture, combine four ounces of powdered or cut      herbs with one pint of alcohol (I use vodka, but brandy,      gin, rum, or even glycerin would also do). . . let the      mixture sit for two weeks (shake it a few times daily) . .      . strain off the liquid . . . and bottle it. That's all      there is to it! The alcohol extracts both the volatile oils      and themedicinal alkaloids of the herbs.    </p>    <p>      Let me go step-by-step through the process the way I do it.      First I grind up the herb or herbs I'm going to      use-either with a mortar and pestle or in an electric      coffee grinder. (By the way, if you're going to use      store-bought herbs in a tincture, buy whole, not powdered,      ones for their greater medicinal potency.) Then I mix herb      and alcohol in a jar, seal the container, and cover it with      a dark cloth to keep out light. I leave it on a kitchen      shelf so I'll see it and remember to shake the jar a couple      of times a day. Two weeks later, I strain off the liquid      through a double layer of cheesecloth. Then I pour the      finished tincture into dark dropper bottles (you can      purchase these at a drugstore) and label them. I use      one-ounce bottles for most tinctures, but two-ounce vessels      for my echinacea tincture because I tend to take large      doses of it. And I always label my jars right after I      bottle them, or else I may forget altogether.    </p>    <p>      One last thing: I mix all my tinctures on the day of the      new moon and strain them off on the full moon, so the      drawing power of the waxing moon will help extract the      plants' properties.    </p>    <p>      Here, then, are the six tinctures I make (there are plenty      of others!) and the ways I use them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Antibiotic tincture:</strong> I make this from four      parts fresh garlic . . . four parts fresh nasturtium leaves      and flowers . . . and one part echinacea root. (You can      also use echinacea's leaves or flowers.) Use four ounces of      this mixture per pint of vodka. Garlic is a natural      antibiotic that attacks harmful bacteria. Nasturtium is an      antiseptic and helps one expel mucus from the lungs and      throat. And echinacea is an excellent antibiotic, blood      purifier, and lymphatic cleanser. The usual dose of this      antibiotic tincture would be one-half dropperful every two      hours for two days, then twice a day for two weeks. I take      it whenever I want to fight an infection.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Echinacea tincture:</strong> Actually, I'm so fond      of echinacea that I more often make a pure tincture of this      herb. Then, whenever I feel a cold coming on, I'll start      the dosage sequence just mentioned and rid myself of the      malady before it becomes a problem. (Sometimes, if I stop      taking the remedy before the two weeks are up-because      I'm feeling so much better-the ailment comes right      back.) I also use the pure echinacea tincture when I'm      feeling sluggish or my blood needs purifying-after      eating a lot of chemical-laced food, for instance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rosemary headache tincture:</strong> This herbal      remedy, made from good old garden rosemary <em>(Rosmarinus      officinalis),</em> can get rid of many headaches instantly.      Try it! Take a half dropperful if you have a headache and      another half dropperful in a half hour if the first one      didn't work . . . but no more for at least eight hours.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Angelica tincture:</strong> I often use this      tincture-made from the roots of the angelica      plant-to strengthen my lungs and sharpen my mental      faculties. I'll take a dose of one teaspoon twice a day for      either use. If you read my article last issue, you'll      recall that angelica root can also be used to warm the body      (try from three to thirty drops for this), to relieve      stomach and intestinal gas and spasms, and to reduce one's      desire to drink alcoholic beverages. Remember, though,      pregnant women should not take any angelica, as it also      promotes menstruation!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Valerian tincture:</strong> I use a tincture made      from the root of <em>Valeriana officinalis</em> as my      favorite sedative for myself and my three-year-old boy,      Stuart. I use a quarter dropperful for Stuart and a half      dropperful for myself. Other nerve-relaxing doses I've seen      recommended are ten to thirty drops for adults, five to      fifteen drops for a six- to twelve-year-old, and one drop      to calm a baby . . . or a dab on a baby's gums to soothe      teething pains. (Some herbalists, though, recommend only      chamomile-a milder herb than valerian-as a      sedative for small children.) I've also used it to ease a      friend's muscle spasms (one-half dropperful every four      hours) and to help ease a fellow gardener's epilepsy      (one-half dropperful twice a day).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Calendula tincture:</strong> I often add a drop of      calendula tincture (made from the flower heads of      <em>Calendula officinalis,</em> or pot marigold) to cuts to      stop bleeding and promote healing. I even applied some      directly on a pig that had had a cesarean section, and she      healed quickly!    </p>    <p>      I also take it internally for bruises, measles, any      eruptive skin disease, and cramps. The dosage would be five      to fifteen drops for sixto twelve-year-olds and ten to      thirty drops (or one-half dropperful) for adults. Take it      twice a day.    </p>    <h3>      SALVES    </h3>    <p>      Salves are herbal skin ointments. The basic ingredients are      an herb (or, more often, a combination of herbs), an oil,      beeswax, and a preservative. To make a salve, first heat      the herbs in the oil, using about two ounces of herbs per      pint of oil. The best oils for this purpose are sesame and      olive. Others can be used, including nondrying oils (such      as apricot, coconut, avocado, and castor, as well as cocoa      butter) for massage or for treating dry skin . . .      semidrying oils (like safflower, sunflower, and wheat germ)      . . . and drying ones (such as soybean and linseed).    </p>    <p>      Heat the oil to just below the boiling point. Add any roots      or barks, and let them cook in a covered stainless steel or      enamel-not aluminum-pot at that      not-quite-boiling temperature for two hours. Add any leaves      and flowers next and continue to cook gently for another      hour. If you're not using any barks or roots, cook your      less volatile herbs for the first two hours and add your      more volatile ones after that. Also, if you're using fresh      herbs, you might want to cook them uncovered for a while to      help evaporate the water in them.    </p>    <p>      Once your ingredients are all cooked, strain the mix: Line      a strainer with a double thickness of cheesecloth, pour the      oil through into another pot, and then squeeze the residual      liquid out of the remaining ball of herbs.    </p>    <p>      Now add beeswax (you can buy this at a health food store      or, less expensively, directly from a beekeeper) . . .      about 1-1/2 ounces per pint of oil. Be cautious here . . .      you don't want to add too much. Also, for each quart of      salve stir in one teaspoon tincture of benzoin or gum      benzoin, commercial preservatives available at drugstores.      This is important; you may apply the salve to broken skin,      so you want to be sure it's free of bacteria.    </p>    <p>      When all the ingredients have been added, test the salve's      consistency by setting a spoonful of it in, the      refrigerator to cool. In a few minutes, check your sample's      hardness. If it's too thin, add more beeswax to your brew,      and test again. When you've got the consistency you want,      immediately pour the salve into small jars-don't let      it cool and solidify in the pot! (I use baby food jars and      acquire them inexpensively by buying old, outdated jars of      food at a discount at grocery stores.) And don't forget to      label your jars. The finished salve may be stored and used      for years.    </p>    <p>      There are dozens of good recipes for herb al salves. At      this point, though, I make mainly two:    </p>    <p>      <strong>All-purpose healing salve:</strong> This is a      wonderful salve. I use it on all of my family's cuts and      wounds to help stop the bleeding, soothe the pain, and      promote healing. Just rub it on the injured spot as often      as desired.    </p>    <p>      As just one example of how well it works, I cut the tip-top      of one finger off once while preparing food for canning. I      put some salve on my finger, put the piece back on with a      Band-Aid, and went back to work. The finger hurt only      minimally and healed completely in several days. (Of      course, if you suffer serious burns or cuts, you should get      appropriate medical help.)    </p>    <p>      The recipe calls for 1-1/2 ounces of comfrey leaves (these      aid in cell production) . . . 3/4 ounce of plantain leaves      (these promote healing and help protect the skin) . . . 3/4      ounce of chickweed leaves (to help reduce inflammation). .      . 1/2 ounce of yarrow leaves (an antibacterial agent) . . .      1/2 ounce of calendula flowers (these promote healing) . .      . and 1/2 ounce of wormwood leaves (to help relieve pain).      I brew them together for two to three hours or overnight,      depending on whether the herbs are dry or green . . . I      cook the comfrey, plantain, and chickweed longer than the      more volatile yarrow, wormwood, and calendula.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Itching and rash salve:</strong> The main      ingredients of this salve are 8 ounces of fresh chickweed      leaves and 4 ounces of comfrey leaves per 16 ounces of oil.      It is an excellent remedy for all itching and rash      ailments. It's particularly good for treating diaper rash      and poison ivy or oak- <em>after</em> you've      carefully cleaned the area of the harmful oils.    </p>    <p>      Homemade tinctures and salves are like homegrown      foods-I can feel good about them because I made them      and know their quality and contents. There's nothing more      satisfying for me than healing myself, my family, and my      friends with herbs I've grown and turned into tinctures and      salves.    </p>    <p>      The recipes for homegrown medicines I gave here are the      ones I make and always have on hand. They're not much      trouble to prepare and they're as easy to use as any      drugstore product. Along with the remedies I shared in Part      I of this article, these tinctures and salves can give you      a good start on creating your own homegrown herbal medicine      chest.    </p>        <p>      There's a lot more you can learn about medicinal herbs, and      there are people much more knowledgeable than I am. I      learned almost everything I've shared in this article from      Donna Leight and Leslie Tierra, two acupuncturists and      herbalists currently practicing in Santa Cruz, California.      And, as I did last time, I'd like to wholeheartedly      recommend Michael Tierra's <em>The Way of Herbs</em> ($5.70      postpaid from Simon & Schuster, Mail-Order Department,      1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020). Of the 15      herb books I have, it's the one that I really use.    </p>    <p>      One last thing: Let me remind you to always pay close      attention to your body. Listen to it. Be sensitive to the      herbs you use and how they are affecting you-let that      help you determine if you're using too much or too little.      Most important, remember that the real key to good health      is proper eating. Herbs, like all self-care measures, are      most effective when used in conjunction with proper diet.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The herbal remedies in this article      should not be used as substitutes for professional medical      attention for any serious health disturbance or for any      chronic warning symptoms. When in doubt, consult your      physician.</em>    </p>    <p>      Song of the Seven Herbs-the <em>book quoted in this      article's precede-is available for $10.45 postpaid      from Dream Feather Productions, P.O. Box 3097, Auburn, CA      95603.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Treeflower Oil: My Favorite of Favorites    </h3>    <p>      <em>I want to share one last herbal remedy with you here.      You can't make this aid from homegrown herbs (it uses      commercially produced edible herb oils), but it works so      well it's become my all-time favorite remedy.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It's called treeflower oil. I use it to stimulate my      immune system and defensive energies. It's warded</em>      <em>off</em> <em>colds, flus, sore throats, headaches,      morning sickness, and nausea. (It's also quite a      stimulant.) You just take a tiny drop of it at a time: I      often dab it on my finger and then put that in my mouth. In      the acute stage of an illness, I may take it every half      hour; otherwise, once every two hours is enough. I often      take it along with my echinacea tincture, because I feel if      I use the two together, 1 can get rid of almost any illness      that's coming on.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To make treeflower oil, you'll have to or</em> <em>der      some high-quality edible oils. (Keihls</em> <em>Company in      New York makes the best-</em> <em>get your local      health food store to order</em> <em>them.) You need camphor      oil... eucalyp</em> <em>tus oil. . . cinnamon oil. . .      clove oil. . .</em> <em>peppermint oil . . . rosemary oil .      . . and</em> <em>ginger oil. Combine equal parts of      each,</em> <em>store the mixture in an eyedropper      bottle,</em> <em>and you'll have as close a thing to an      "herb</em> <em>al miracle cure" as I've discovered. Do</em>      <em>remember, though, to use treeflower</em> oil only for      medicinal purposes.    </p>
