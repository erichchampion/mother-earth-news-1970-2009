                <p>      <em>Do you have high energy costs? Dreary surroundings? You      can solve both of these problems with...</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Thelma E. Honey    </h5>        <p>      It's no news to most people that heating or cooling a      mobile home can be a very expensive proposition. It may      come as a surprise, however, to learn that with only a      moderate outlay of money and time, these energy costs can      be noticeably reduced. In addition, you can gain a place to      grow fresh foods, sturdy seedlings for transplanting to      outside beds or containers, and a year-round supply of      beautiful flowers to grace the dining table and brighten      the home.    </p>    <p>      I'm speaking, of course, of the benefits you get when you      build an attached greenhouse. Mine, a 7' X 24' structure,      does all of the above very well; furthermore, its design is      simple, its materials are standard, and it can be easily      duplicated or adapted by anyone with basic carpentry skills      and equipment.    </p>    <h3>      BEGINNING AT THE END    </h3>    <p>      My Albuquerque mobile home is large (24' X 52'), but the      construction principles I followed would be the same for      any size home. The greenhouse was attached to the south (in      my case, 24') end of the home. My son did the designing,      wiring, and insulating . . . a hired carpenter did the      foundation and framing . . . and I did most of the glazing      and finish work. First we removed one window from the      adjoining office (originally a bedroom) and replaced it      with a door to provide access to the interior of the house.      We then poured a 6" X 12" concrete footing and topped it      with 6" X 8" X 16" masonry blocks to form the foundation.      One foot of pumice was used for ground insulation, while      inch-thick sheets of plastic foam were used to insulate the      foundation.    </p>    <p>      Next we constructed the greenhouse framework-out of 2      X 4s-at the proper angle to catch the sun's rays in      winter. Authors Rick Fisher and Bill Yanda state in <em>The      Food and Heat Producing Solar Greenhouse</em> (John Muir      Publications, Inc.) that "a formula . . . for establishing      the tilt of the south face is the latitude plus 35      degrees." However, this optimum angle can be varied      somewhat without losing much light transmittance.    </p>    <p>      I used greenhouse-grade fiberglass on the outside of the      structure and Monsanto 602 UV <em>.</em> resistant plastic      on the inside, creating double walls with a dead air space      in between. And by applying sealants at every crack and      juncture, I've been able to minimize heat loss.    </p>    <h3>      THE INSIDE STORY    </h3>    <p>      Ten 55-gallon oil drums were cleaned, painted black, laid      side by side on a framework, and filled with water to      collect and store the sun's heat for later dissipation at      night. We piled river rock on the floor area behind the      drums to hold additional warmth. A workbench was      constructed over the barrels and a deck laid over the      rocks; both platforms were built of 2 X 4s nailed 1/2"      apart to provide slots for drainage. The entire interior of      the greenhouse can be easily hosed down to remove dust and      dirt and to increase the humidity. White paint on the      walls, supports, deck, and benches reflects sunlight to all      sides of the plants, helping them to grow evenly; as a      fringe benefit, it also makes the interior of the structure      appear larger and airier than it actually is.    </p>    <p>      Here in New Mexico the intensity of the sun dictates a      solid roof on any dwelling, be it for people, pets, or      plants. So I put corrugated metal roofing backed with 6"      fiberglass insulation batts above the ceiling in the      greenhouse. Since summer sunlight was still too hot and      bright for many plants, I set removable panels of      inch-thick plastic foam between the 2 X 4s on the outside.      In the interior, I installed ordinary window shades upside      down along the outer edge of the workbench. I centered a      screw eye in the bottom rod of each shade and another screw      eye set in the greenhouse framework just above it. Nylon      cord was run through the paired screw eyes and knotted,      enabling each shade to be raised to the exact height      desired for optimum shading of the bench and interior.    </p>    <p>      Other features include an old kitchen sink-purchased      at a junkyard for $10-which was connected to plastic      pipe that brings in water from an outside faucet. We also      used plastic pipe to make a straight, trapless drain that      carries wastewater to a plant bed outside. Clay pots,      plastic pots, and 20-gallon plastic garbage pails      containing various potting materials are all stored under a      bench along the north wall. I place plants needing diffused      light and less heat on this bench or hang them from hooks      above it.    </p>    <p>      To make good use of the heat generated in the greenhouse,      we installed an exhaust fan and a duct near the ceiling to      funnel hot air into the rest of the mobile home, but most      of the time the warmth circulates freely without the use of      the fan. Outside ventilation is provided by a set of vents      and a window on the east end. A used evaporative cooler      takes care of most of the structure's air-conditioning      needs. Purchased for $25, it was installed on the vent at      the east end and often supplies enough cool air for the      entire home. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Swamp coolers, as these      units are sometimes called, are most effective where the      outside humidity is very low, as in the southwestern United      States.]</em> I now use the home's main air-conditioning      unit only on extremely hot summer days.    </p>    <h3>      A BREAKDOWN VERSION    </h3>    <p>      Mobile home owners who would prefer a <em>portable</em>      greenhouse will find that one similar to mine can be      constructed from panels: 8' X 8' is a good, workable size.      The two ends of the greenhouse, one side, and the roof can      all be held together with slip pins inserted in regular      hinges. Barrels can be placed against the mobile home wall      or at other strategic places. Freestanding benches can be      used for potted plants, or plants can be grown directly in      the ground, as in a cold frame. The entire portable unit      should be anchored to a foundation of some kind, however,      such as concrete blocks or railroad ties.    </p>    <h3>      THE BOTTOM LINE    </h3>    <p>      My greenhouse was built from new materials in 1977. At that      time, the total cost-including labor-was $980. A      pproximately $500 of that sum was for materials. Today the      cost would be higher, of course, but you could save a      considerable amount if you built with good used lumber.    </p>    <p>      And is the whole thing worth it? Absolutely, I say! My      greenhouse cut my fuel consumption in <em>half</em> the      very first year; meanwhile, my house has been beautified      season after season with blossoming geraniums, petunias,      begonias, and gloriously fragrant freesias. I feel my      initial investment started paying off right at the start,      and has kept on doing so, year after year.    </p>
