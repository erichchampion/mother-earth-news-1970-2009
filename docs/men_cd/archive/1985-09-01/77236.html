                    <h5 id="byline">      by Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>    <h3>      LOCAL SOURCES OF UNUSUAL PLANTS    </h3>    <p>      How many times have you tried unsuccessfully to locate a      commercial source for some interesting plant you saw in a      nearby public garden or arboretum? Perhaps you've not      thought about trying to obtain that seed, cutting, or graft      from the obvious source-the garden where you saw it!      We have found that both large private growers and staff      members at public gardens are usually eager to aid home      gardeners in securing starts of hard-to-find plants.    </p>    <p>      If you are an amateur seeking aid, it's very important to      do your "homework" on the appropriate propagation      techniques for the plants you're interested in. And <em>you      must</em> cooperate fully with the donors. This means      <em>no</em> collecting without asking! You should not      bother other gardeners for starts of <em>common</em>      plants, of course; nor should you ask for patented or      otherwise protected materials.    </p>    <p>      You'll find extraordinary educational benefits from      interacting with experienced growers; most of these people      are all but bubbling over with new ideas, tips, and useful      suggestions. Just remember: After you've established your      own private garden with the aid of local professionals, you      have an obligation to help other gardeners get plant      starts!    </p>    <h3>      RESEARCH BRIEFS    </h3>    <p>      If the squash is bitter, don't eat it. On rare occasions, a      zucchini or a yellow straightneck plant will produce quite      bitter fruits. According to horticulturists at the Alabama      Agricultural Experiment Station, bitter squash has high      concentrations of cucurbitacin E, which is highly toxic to      humans and which probably results from chance reversions to      ancestral forms or from pollination by wild species.      Because even a tiny amount of cucurbitacin E can be      harmful, don't eat any squash that has a bitter taste;      instead, save its seeds and send them to the Horticulture      Department at the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station      (Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849) to aid research on      the causes of bitter squash.    </p>    <p>      "Dry light" for stored potatoes. If you've had trouble in      the past with the sprouting of stored potatoes, take a tip      from Canadian researchers: Store your tubers in a place      that is <em>not</em> in total darkness and where the      humidity is as low as possible. In experiments at the      University of Regina, Saskatchewan, sprout growth of      potatoes stored at room temperature was significantly      reduced by keeping relative humidity at 40% and by      providing moderate light (typical indoor lighting or a room      with daylight is fine, but avoid direct sunlight).    </p>    <p>      Stake young trees loosely! Experiments at the University of      California at Davis have shown that if young trees are      allowed to bend somewhat with the wind, they generally      develop more trunk strength than do trees staked rigidly.      To help your trees "help themselves" to better      self-support, use flexible stakes or ties.    </p>        <p>      Blueberries: Early fall pruning = delayed spring bloom.      According to researchers at the University of Rhode Island,      highbush blueberries pruned in midSeptember bloom up to a      week later the following spring than do bushes pruned in      either mid-November or mid-February. (Use caution with      early pruning if you have extremely low winter      temperatures-experiment first on just a few plants.)      If you live where late spring frosts are a problem, the      slight delay in blooming might make a <em>big</em>      difference in crop yields!    </p>    <p>      Newspapers with colored inks are safe to use for mulching.      Most gardeners have heard that newspapers with colored inks      have high concentrations of lead and are unsafe to use as      mulch. But an agronomist at the U.S. Department of      Agriculture has found that colored-ink newspapers actually      pose no significant threat of heavy-metal contamination.      And the publisher of the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> has      confirmed that the colored inks currently used are made      from organic chemicals and contain negligible lead. So      don't be afraid to use <em>all</em> the news for mulching!    </p>    <p>      Poly bags extend okra shelf life. Okra tends to lose its      quality very rapidly after being picked, particularly when      stored at room temperature. Researchers in India found that      unpackaged okra had a shelf life of 2 days; they increased      it to 15 days by keeping the harvested vegetable in      nonperforated polyethylene bags (perforated poly bags gave      a shelf life of 7 days).    </p>    <p>      Gassy beans? Try sprouting them! If you have a fine crop of      beans (especially soybeans) but are wary of their tendency      to produce intestinal gas and cramps, be advised that      experiments in India with sprouting several kinds of legume      seeds-including common beans, chick-peas, mung beans,      and fava beans-have shown that the oligosaccharides      responsible for the gassiness of legume seeds are      eliminated within 72 hours after germination. So enjoy your      beans this year-sprouted!</p>      <h3>GLEANINGS</h3>    <p>      A newly revised and expanded edition of Ohio Cooperative      Extension Bulletin 614, "Disease Control in the Landscape,"      discusses common diseases of ornamental trees, shrubs, and      flowers, and includes color photographs of disease      symptoms. It's available for $4.50 postpaid from      Cooperative Extension Service Publications Office, 1945      Frebis Ave., Columbus, OH 43206 . . . . Anyone      contemplating construction of a solar greenhouse should      take a look at <em>Solar Greenhouses and Sunspaces: Lessons      Learned,</em> which is based on the greenhouse projects      funded by the Appropriate Technology Small Grants Program      of the U.S. Department of Energy. You can order the book      for $2.25 postpaid from GPO, Superintendent of Documents,      Washington, DC 20402 . . . . Followers of the late Alan      Chadwick (who worked tirelessly to introduce      biodynamic/French intensive gardening methods to Americans)      have formed a Chadwick Society to continue his teachings. A      sample copy of the society's newsletter-a mix of      practical horticultural information and literary      articles-is $5.00 postpaid from Green Gulch Farm,      ACS, Star Route 1, Sausalito, CA 94965 . . . . The <em>Herb      Information Handbook,</em> compiled by Ruth Wrensch, lists      320 herb species hardy to-20Â°F, with species and      common names, general descriptions, propagation methods,      native habitats, light needs, uses, etc. At $5.00 postpaid      (from Boerner Botanical Gardens, 5879 S. 92nd St., Hales      Corners, WI 53130), it's a bargain.<br />      <br />      EDITOR'S NOTE: Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their      own food on a small farm and publish HortIdeas, a fine      newsletter on gardening research and products (available      for $10 a year from G. & P. Williams, Rt. 1, Box 302,      Gravel Switch, KY 40328).    </p>
