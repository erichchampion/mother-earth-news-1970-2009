        	    		<h5 id="byline">      by R. J. HOLLIDAY D.V.M.    </h5>		<p>      Whether you live in a city apartment or a wilderness cabin,      if you own pets or livestock someday you will probably have      to care for an injured animal. And, strangely enough, a      pampered Persian cat, a backwoods pack horse or a suburban      family cow all heal in basically the same fashion and all      respond to similar treatment.    </p>    <p>      Most people when suddenly confronted by a wounded animal      feel that they MUST DO SOMETHING! More often than not what      they do is wrong because, in their haste, they forget that      Nature has been healing creatures for eons with rather good      results. Sometimes, a little benign neglect on the part of      the owner (and many veterinarians) will do much to aid the      ultimate well-being of an injured animal. The most sacred      precept of Medical Practice is: If you cannot help your      patient; at least, DO HIM NO HARM! So keep this in mind;      Nature heals, we can only help.    </p>    <p>      If one of your animals is injured, the first thing to do is      to control any severe hemorrhage. A stream of blood that      pulsates in rhythm with the heart-beat indicates a severed      artery. No such rhythmic pulsations are seen if only a vein      is damaged. In either case, if bleeding is profuse, apply a      tight compress of some sort to the area. The pressure      applied to the wound helps to stem the flow of blood and      favors the formation of a firm clot.    </p>    <p>      If the wound is in a position where it can be easily      bandaged, a bandage can be combined with the compress.      However, don't make it so tight that it cuts off      circulation. Tourniquets should not be used except as a      last resort, as they frequently do more harm than good.    </p>    <p>      Another warning! Just because Good Old Uncle Ned used to do      it, don't subject the wound to flour, ashes or other "gunk"      that is reputed to stop bleeding. Most of these substances      have no effect on hemorrhage and they can be a major source      of contamination and irritation.    </p>    <p>      The question that logically arises then is: "Well, what      <em>should</em> I put on a wound?" It would be more      appropriate to ask, "Should I put anything on it at all?"      More people do more harm to their animals by "putting      something on it" than you can imagine; and you wouldn't      believe the variety of substances that have been used in a      vain attempt to speed healing.    </p>    <p>      Irritating, caustic materials such as turpentine, coal oil,      or salt are never indicated for use on wounds, even if they      would kill germs . . . which they won't. It is better to      have a mildly infected wound than one in which the ability      to heal itself has been destroyed by the use of strong      chemicals. Powders should be avoided because they tend to      combine with fluids from the wound and may form a crust,      thus sealing in the offending bacteria and providing an      ideal environment for bacterial growth.    </p>    <p>      Actually, the only reason to use any topical antiseptics on      a wound is to remove the dirt or debris that may be present      and to reduce the numbers of contaminating bacteria. Mild      soap and water will serve effectively in both capacities,      and will not further damage the injured tissues and thus      impede the normal healing process. An oily substance helps      to keep the wound soft, and avoids the drying and cracking      of the wound edges that would also interfere with healing.    </p>    <p>      Now that you have the bleeding stopped and the wound clean      and sanitized, you should take steps to see that any widely      separated edges of skin are brought into a position of      "togetherness" so that fast, scar-free healing can take      place. Sometimes this can be done by skillful bandaging,      but if this is impossible the wound may have to be sutured      for best results. A word of caution: If a bandage is not      required to control hemorrhage, to exclude dirt or to hold      the edges of the wound together, don't use one. Most wounds      will heal more quickly if they're exposed to the air.    </p>    <p>      In summary then, the primary considerations in dealing with      any wounds are: (1) Control hemorrhage, (2) If necessary,      clean the wound and keep it clean, (3) Keep the edges of      the wound together, if at all possible, (4) Don't use      anything on the wound that will interfere with the normal      healing process.    </p>    <p>      The different species of farm animals vary greatly in the      speed with which they heal. For the technical-minded, this      difference is mainly caused by differences in the rate of      <em>leucocyte mobilization</em> (LMR), or the speed with      which the white bloodcells are able to get to a wound and      begin to repair the damage.    </p>    <p>      Horses and ponies are by far the most difficult of all      domestic animals to treat. Not only are they seemingly      accident-prone, but they also panic easily when hurt and      they have a very slow LMR. Sheep, goats, and poultry are      sometimes prey to the ravages of dogs or wolves, but if      their wounds are not too severe, they heal quickly with      adequate care.    </p>    <p>      Beef cattle are usually not subject to too many injuries,      but dairy cattle and dairy goats are very susceptible to      damage to their udders and teats. Dogs are sometimes      subjected to the unhealthy effects of encounters with      barbed wire, automobiles, or other dogs or wild animals.      Hogs or pigs almost never get hurt and cats are nearly      immune to injuries except for the bites and scratches from      the perennial, intra-species debate over who gets a date      with the pretty Tabby that just moved into the      neighborhood.    </p>    <p>      Many times the reason people are forced to call a      veterinarian is because they fail to use any advance      planning. This lack of anticipation of livestock accidents      and the lack of preparation for emergencies, can be      dangerous to your livestock and pets and costly to you. So,      plan ahead . . . assemble the products discussed below into      a first aid kit, keep it stocked, and keep it handy. You      may never need to use the kit, but if you do, it will be      worth it's weight in gold.    </p>    <p>      <em>Vaseline</em> is a very good wound dressing. It coats a      wounded surface, prevents the entrance of dirt onto the      surface of the wound, and keeps the skin soft. The addition      of a small amount of Iodine solution to the vaseline adds      enough antiseptic qualities to make the mixture an      excellent anti-bacterial.    </p>    <p>      <em>Tincture of Iodine</em> (Iodine in an alcohol base) is      a strong disinfecting material. It's penetrating properties      recommend it for use on the navel cords of new-born animals      and for injuries to the hooves of large domestic animals.      It should not be used full strength on open wounds or      abrasions.    </p>    <p>      <em>Lugol's Iodine Solution</em> (Iodine in a water base)      is less effective topically than the Tincture, but it has      the advantage of being effective when given orally as an      anti-infective. The dosage is 1 or 2 drops for each 5 lbs.      of body weight daily. Thus, the daily dose for a 1000 lb.      cow or horse would be 200 to 400 drops and since 100 drops      is approximately equal to one teaspoonful, this would      amount to about 2 to 4 teaspoonfuls. A 20 lb. dog would get      4 to 8 drops daily. This dose can be administered in the      feed or the water, and should not be continued for longer      than 10 days without a 10 day rest period between courses      of treatment. Lugol's Iodine Solution is classified as a      prescription drug if you indicate to the druggist that it      is to be used on humans but no restrictions are placed on      any use for animals. A pint should cost less than $3.00.      Never, never use any iodine products on cats unless you      hate cats and are trying to dispose of them. Cats are very      susceptible to iodine poisoning.    </p>    <p>      Keep plenty of <em>Castor</em> <em>Oil</em> on hand. In      addition to it's well known laxative properties, it's also      a good wound dressing and it can be used for eye-drops. If      rubbed liberally into warts, castor oil will generally have      a curative effect on most of them. Don't worry if you get      some on your hands; castor oil is also a good hand lotion.    </p>    <p>      <em>Pine tar</em> is a g ood insect repellant. If you live      in an area where "screw-worms" or "flesh-flies" are      prevalent this product will help to control their attacks      on wounds. Pine tar is soluble only in oil, so use castor      oil or other vegetable oil to thin it to the desired      consistency. It's best to apply pine tar only to the tips      of the hair surrounding a wound; this will avoid irritating      the wound and causing loss of hair at the site of      application. Pine tar can also be used on bandages to      discourage a patient from chewing on them.    </p>    <p>      The dried or fresh leaves or roots of the <em>comfrey plant      (Symphytum officinale)</em> are useful to speed healing in      hardto-heal wounds or ulcerated areas on the skin when the      macerated leaves or roots are used as a poultice on the      affected area. The active ingredient in this plant is      "allantoin". a substance which stimulates the growth of      epithelial (skin) cells and thus decreases the time      required for healing of the wound to take place. Even      though comfrey may be found growing wild, it's best to      plant some on the homestead to assure yourself of a fresh      supply that you can depend upon. The plant is very easy to      grow.    </p>    <p>      <em>Cod Liver</em> Oil or <em>Wheat Germ</em> Oil can be      used as protectants on wounds but their greatest merit is      as a dietary source of Vitamin A, D and E. These vitamins      are necessary to the normal functioning of the healing      process. Either one or both can be added to the ration of      any injured animal or, better yet, use them regularly to      insure the health of all your livestock. A healthy, well      nourished animal heals much faster than one that is      deficient in any one of the required dietary substances.    </p>    <p>      Include in your kit a generous supply of <em>cloth</em> or      <em>gauze</em> that can be used for bandages, compresses      and dressings. Don't worry too much about the absolute      sterility of these dressings so long as they are clean.    </p>    <p>      One other aspect of "planning ahead" I should mention is      vaccination. While I do not recommend the indiscriminate      use of any vaccine; there are two diseases commonly      associated with wounds that are best prevented by routine      immunization. These diseases are Rabies and Tetanus.    </p>    <p>      As you probably know, <em>Rabies is</em> spread by the bite      of infected animals and is almost always fatal. I say      "almost" because just recently one case has been cured. The      vaccination for dogs is quite effective and lasts up to      three years. The use of the vaccine in other animals is not      generally recommended unless an unusual situation exists.    </p>    <p>      <em>Tetanus,</em> or <em>Lockjaw, is</em> a disease that      all animals can get but it is most troublesome in horses.      The causative organism will not grow in the presence of      oxygen however: It requires a deep puncture wound that      seals over and excludes air. A very effective vaccine is      available for tetanus and a booster should be administered      once a year. In an emergency, an unvaccinated animal can be      given <em>Tetanus Antitoxin,</em> but it's protection lasts      only about ten days. Once symptoms of tetanus develop,      treatment is usually very disappointing.    </p>    <p>      Please bear in mind that in making the above      recommendations, I assume that you do not have immediate      access to a qualified veterinarian. If a vet is available,      do not hesitate to contact him for advice and service,      especially if your efforts at first-aid do not have the      desired results.    </p>    <p>      I hope you will never have to deal with a wounded animal      but, if you do, please don't ever put yourself in a      situation where you'll have to tell a vet: "Doc, I can't      understand it. I've tried salt, sheep dip, ashes,      turpentine, spider webs, sulfur, creosote, and some stuff      my granddaddy had in an unlabeled bottle; and that dang      sore still won't heal . . . "    </p>
