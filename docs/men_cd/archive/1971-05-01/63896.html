                    <h5 id="byline">      by CHARLES F. JENKINS    </h5>    <p>      A SURE CURE AND SUDDEN DEATH FOR POTATO BUGS!<br />      Send 25 cents to Box 007, Bunkville for full details.    </p>    <p>      Shortly before the turn of the century, advertisements      similar to the above appeared in scattered news sheets. The      reply was short and to the point: <em>Find two smooth      bricks. Pick one or more potato bugs from the potato patch.      Place bug on one brick and smash it with the other.</em>      Since then, advertisers have gone in for more subtle      chicanery . . chemical cures for all that ails the garden .      . . with built-in residual problems at no extra charge.    </p>            <p>      Unfortunately, today's promoters of the "quick cure" for      every gardening problem have-by the very force of      their multi-million dollar advertising      campaigns-collectively convinced large segments of      the population that insect pests can be controlled only      through the use of manufactured chemical poisons . . . and      that's simply not true. You can stay ahead of harmful      insects in many non-violent and nonpoisonous ways. To name      only a few: companion planting and natural repellents;      natural sprays and dusts; evasion and deception;      intoxicants; "good" microbic agents, insect predators and      parasites; birds, poultry, reptiles and small animals; and      resistant varieties of plants.    </p>    <h3>      COMPANION PLANTING    </h3>    <p>      Some of those gentle perfumes which drift up from the      garden are noxious repellants to the insect freeloaders      that zero in on the vegetable patch. So planting certain      "smelly" flowers like Marigolds to stand as border guards      and in ternal sentries is the first-and      easiest-step in organic pest control.    </p>    <p>      French or African marigolds do an excellent job of keeping      bean beetles on the other side of the fence. I find French      Dwarf marigolds very effective with bush beans and beetles      stay clear of my bean rows when every third plant is      marigold. For larger plants which are appetizing to      beetles, I use the taller African marigolds. Marigolds are      also credited with destroying Verticillium wilt on potatoes      and for making the soil in their root area uncomfortable      for wireworms and eel worms. Yes, marigolds will do a good      job in the vegetable patch.    </p>    <p>      Other flowers which make suitable garden sentinels (all      terrible stinkers as far as the enemy is concerned) are      asters, calendula, chrysanthemums, cosmos, geraniums,      nasturtiums and tansy. Undoubtedly there are many others.    </p>    <p>      I find it handier to start my guardian flowers in flats or      a row of their own and transplant them (as you do cabbage      plants) to their final location in the garden. You may,      however, seed such flowers directly into the vegetable      patch if you prefer.    </p>    <p>      Of course, flowers are not the only repellers of garden      pests. You can noticeably diminish insect attacks on your      vegetable plot merely by the way you arrange it.    </p>    <p>      If you alternate a row of green beans with a row of      potatoes, for instance, you will get a cooperative effect.      The green beans will repel the Colorado potato beetle . . .      and the potatoes will repel the Mexican bean beetle.      Potatoes will also stay healthier when you plant horse      radish or flax nearby for potato bugs never stay around      these plants.    </p>    <p>      Tomatoes planted near asparagus, create an atmosphere      inhospitable to asparagus beetles. A few plants scattered      through the asparagus bed, or along the edges of the plot      will do the job. We've found the early, short stalked      tomatoes most suitable because we can mulch them heavily      and then let them grow with no more attention. Other kinds      of tomatoes will do as well, but you would either have to      stake or sucker them to keep them from wandering all over      the area. In any case you can use the tomatoes when they're      ripe: it's the plant-not the fruit-which does      the repelling. Touch a tomato vine sometime and then notice      how long the scent lingers on your fingers. It's powerful      stuff!    </p>    <p>      We've also found that sage planted with cabbages will repel      the moth whose eggs hatch into the little green worms that      gobble the cabbage before you do. Even radishes make good      companions for some plants. If you drop six to eight melon      or cucumber seeds into a shallow hole about the diameter of      a tea cup and plant a few radish seeds around them in a      slightly larger circle you'll protect the emerging melon      and cucumber plants from beetle foraging. In this case, of      course, you must leave the radishes in the ground so plant      your table supply elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      All vegetables appear to be helped by companion planting      with one or several varieties of the aromatic herbs. Chives      at the feet of roses, for example, keep aphids away. Herbs      such as borage, lavender, hyssop, sage, parsley, chervil,      tarragon, chives, thyme, marjoram, dill, camomile, lovage      and wormwood will help protect many garden plants . . . and      they're good for cooking too!    </p>    <p>      Some other plants which fend off attacks on their      companions include wormwood (repels flea beetles from      tomatoes): basil (wards off many insects which eat      tomatoes); tomatoes, mint and rosemary (repels cabbage      butterfly); nasturtium seeds in squash hills (for squash      pests); summer savory or potatoes (wards off Mexican bean      beetles); geraniums or marigolds (repels various corn      pests).    </p>    <p>      Plants which are said to be mutually beneficial are carrots      and peas; celery with beans or leeks; onions and beans;      radishes and Lettuce; tomatoes and parsley; turnips and      peas.    </p>    <h3>      NATURAL SPRAYS AND DUSTS    </h3>    <p>      Just as the marigold next door works to keep beetles out of      the beans, so may a marigold spray be used for the same      results. Any plant or flower which is considered a general      or specific deterrent in companion can be liquified and      made into a protective spray. To do this, grind whole      plants to a pulp, dissolve in two to three times as much      water, strain off the liquid . . . and stand by the pumps!    </p>    <p>      It is thought that injurious insects are attracted to fruit      trees by an odor which eminates from the fruit-bearers      themselves. A formula I have found successful in deterring      tree pests is one which I learned while attending an annual      convention of the Michigan Organic Gardeners. It consists      of 2 gallons of kerosene-plus one bar of hard soap      such as Fels Naptha-mixed in 100 gallons of water. I      shave a bar of Fels Naptha soap with a paring knife and      dump the shavings in a quart bottle. After filling the      bottle with water, I shake it until the soap flakes are      liquified.    </p>    <p>      Since I use a slide type spray gun and a bucket of solution      instead of a 100-gallon barrel, my modified formula is      approximately 1-1/4 ounces of kerosene and one ounce of      liquid soap to a gallon of water. I spray before bloom,      after petal fall, and every two or three weeks later. With      peaches I stop spraying when the green fruit is the size of      large olives. Some organic gardeners prefer to use corn oil      emulsions, salt water or linseed oil sprays to protect      their fruit trees.    </p>    <p>      A 3% solution of miscible oil available at any garden store      is another relatively safe but potent weapon. A dormant      spray of this oil (in late winter or early spring when the      temperature is above freezing but before any buds have      opened) is effective against many chewing and sucking      insects such as aphids, red spiders, thrips, mealybugs,      white flies, pear psylla and scale. Dormant oil spraying      also covers the eggs of other insects and prevents them      from hatching.    </p>    <p>      When spraying dormant oils, cover one tree at a time rather      than working down a row and spraying only one side of each      tree. The theory here is that with one complete spray the      surplus will run off evenly, whereas row spraying creates a      double cover on portions of the dried side.    </p>    <p>      If a stiff wallop is needed to knock out a heavy      infestation of bugs, you can use Ryania which is the powder      from ground roots of a South American plant, Ryania      speciosa. Recommended dose is one ounce to two gallons of      water. Rotenone and Pyrethrum also carry a lethal punch for      many insects - without harming animals. Rotenone is      derived from several tropical plants and can be had in pure      form from pet shops and veterinarians. The commercial      packages usually have rotenone mixed with other materials      which are not always acceptable, however, so try to get      your rotenone "straight and uncut". For best results it is      necessary to repeat these sprays four or five times during      the growing season.    </p>        <p>      Just as a good whiff of garlic on the breath can hold your      fellow man at arm's length, a little garlic juice diluted      with water and sprayed on or under fruit trees will deter      some obnoxious insects. Garlic powder seems just as      effective as freshly squeezed garlic juice for making such      a spray.    </p>    <p>      Drs. W.R. Jenkins and R.A. Rohde of the University of      Maryland discovered that asparagus was less affected by      nemetodes than any other plant. Their experiments also      proved that asparagus juice killed all the types of      nemetodes found in Maryland when applied to the roots and      sprayed on the foliage of a variety of nemetode-affected      plants. The leaf spray appeared to be the more effective.    </p>    <p>      We have used milk as a spray for the tomato mosaic virus in      our small greenhouse. Whole milk, dried milk, and diluted      milk were all satisfactory.    </p>    <p>      Sweet pepper juice does a splendid job restraining cucumber      mosaic . . . and hot pepper juice has a legion of advocates      for its power to repel chewing insects. We've found hot      pepper juice diluted with 4 to 6 parts water - with a      little liquid soap added for coating and binding -      does a grand job on cabbage worms.    </p>    <p>      Green onion juice diluted with equal parts of water and      squirted on roses will clean aphids from the stems. Dousing      the rose plants no more than three successive days does the      trick.    </p>    <p>      For fighting spider mites on our several apple trees we use      a formula developed by Dr. G. Edward Marshall of Purdue      University. It is a mixture of 20 pounds of wheat flour and      two quarts of buttermilk stirred into slop and added to 100      gallons of water. For our limited needs I reduced the      proportion to two cups of flour, four ounces of buttermilk      and 2-1/2 gallons of water. I have found that being a bit      careless on the overside did not change the results so far      as I could determine.    </p>    <p>      If you are having a contest with ear worms in your sweet      corn, here's another use of oil that may help you. When the      s weet corn has begun to tassle take an eye dropper or      small oil can and squirt several drops of mineral oil into      the end of each ear. Be sure to get all of the tassle good      and damp. The principle behind this method can be logically      explained-but one wag has it that the ear worm      ingests so much oil before getting to the corn . . . that      diarrhea makes him too weak to eat it.    </p><h3>EVASION AND DECEPTION</h3>    <p>      If you are in an area where the corn borer is aggravating,      you can survive his onslaught by planting two or three      weeks later in the season than normal. This will leave you      with a clear field for the real thing. It's a principle      which can be used to deal with any pest which-for the      most part-arrives at just one time in the season to      do it's damage. Or, alternatively, you can plant a small      'dummy' crop to be destroyed when infested . . . bugs and      all.    </p><h3>INTOXICANTS</h3>        <p>      The easiest way to stay ahead of Gastropods (slugs n'      snails) is to get them drunk! They LOVE beer . . . and you      won't go broke keeping them supplied either. A few saucers      or lid-shalf filled and dug in flush with the      ground-will "pack 'em in" overnight like the only bar      in town. Even empty containers (bottles and cans with      openings flush to the ground) will attract crowds of snails      and slugs . . . as long as the slightest whiff of their      beloved brew lingers on.    </p>    <p>      If you are a total abstainer, and have no friends who are      sots-you will find that grapefruit hulls, placed      round side up in the evening, will be home and shelter to      families of slugs and snails by morning. Gastropods are      night operators and hide in the daytime under anything      convenient.    </p>    <h3>      MICROBIC AGENTS, INSECT PREDATORS AND PARASITES    </h3>    <p>      In our struggle to discourage certain bugs we must not      forget that many little creatures are our buddies. Lady      bugs clear up scales, insect eggs and larvae, white flies      and spider mites at one sitting. The praying mantis has a      catholic taste for soft-bodied insects such as lice and      flies and is also quite happy to munch grasshopper steaks      and chinch bug hams. Lacewings, wasps, bees, ants and stink      bugs also lend a hand on the harmful pest control detail.    </p>        <p>      The microbial agents and parasites which flourish in a      "natural controls only" environment are on our side, too.      Microspar molds, to site one example, are tiny carnivorous      plants that kill and consume nemetodes with sticky nobs      called "lethal lollipops".    </p>    <p>      Both dormant lady bugs and praying mantis egg cases (which      can be strategically and equally located around a garden)      are available by mail. For lady bugs write: <em>L.E.</em>      <em>Schnoor, Rough & Ready, California 95975.</em> For      Mantis eggs: <em>Bio Control Co., Route 2, Box 2397,      Auburn, California 95603. To</em> learn how to attract your      OWN beneficial bugs, write: <em>BO-BIOTROL, 54 South Bear      Creek Drive, Merced. California 95340,</em> and ask about      their "insect attractant".    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIRDS, POULTRY,</strong> <strong>REPTILES AND SMALL      ANIMALS</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Larger "animated insecticides" also earn their keep around      the garden. Geese, ducks, chickens, toads, snakes, birds,      skunks and other of our small feathered, scaled and furry      friends do an incredible job. Beatrice Trum Hunter, in her      book, GARDENING WITHOUT POISONS, quotes The Garden Club of      America Conservation Committee:    </p>    <p>      A House Wren feeds 500 spiders and caterpillars to its      young during one summer afternoon.<br />      A Swallow devours 1000 leafhoppers in 12 hours.<br />      A pair of Flickers consider 5000 ants a mere snack.<br />      A Baltimore Oriole consumes 17 hairy caterpillars a      minute.<br />      A Brown Thrasher can eat over 6000 insects in a day.    </p>    <p>      Feeding birds in the wintertime encourages them to stick      around and help out in the bug-laden summer . . . and a      bird house or two doesn't hurt either.    </p><h3>RESISTANT VARIETIES</h3>    <p>      In the final analysis, it's the weak plant that is first      attacked by insects and our agricultural schools have done      an exceptional job of breeding resistant varieties of      plants.. If you have a particular problem-or expect      one-read the labels on the seed packets until you      find a variety specifically bred to withstand the bug or      disease that bothers your vegetables.    </p>    <p>      The following list, taken from the book Peacock Manure      & Marigolds, is a quick, general guide to some of the      best resistant vegetable varieties for the northeastern      United States. Your local farm bureau or state experiment      station will tell you if other varieties are preferred in      your area.    </p>    <p>      Asparagus-the Washington strains (Mary and Martha      both rust-resistant)<br />      Beans (green)-Tendergreen<br />      Beans (pole)-Kentucky (pole)<br />      Kentucky (bush lima)-Fordhook<br />      Beet-Detroit Dark Red<br />      Broccoli-Calabrese<br />      Cabbage-Early Jersey Wakefield<br />      Carrot-Tender sweet, Red-cored Chantenay      (early)<br />      Carrot-Danvers Half, long (midseason)<br />      Carrot-Long Orange (late)<br />      Cauliflower-Snowball<br />      Chinese Cabbage-Pe-tsai<br />      Cucumber-Burpee Hybrid<br />      Eggplant-Black Beauty<br />      Lettuce-Black-seeded Simpson (early loose-leaf),      White Boston, Bibb, Buttercrunch<br />      Onion-Yellow Globe Danvers, Southport White Globe      (for early green onions)<br />      Parsley-Italian plain<br />      Peas-Freezonian, Telephone, Laxtonian<br />      Radish-Cherry Belle, White Icicle<br />      Squash-Golden Straight Neck, Zucchini<br />      Sweet Corn-North Star (early), Wonderful (succession      crops) Swiss ChardLucullus<br />      Tomato-Marglobe; Red Cherry    </p>        <p>      And remember: when you grow healthy plants on fertile soil      your pest problems will be minimal right from the start.      Your objective (and every gardener's) should be to build      the most fertile soil possible in which to raise our      vegetables. Again, that can largely be done only by natural      means and not by quick, "one shot" chemical miracles.      There's no short cut to natural good health.    </p>    <p>      Many of the ideas we practice have come not only from our      own experiments, but from books, pamphlets and lectures,      such as:    </p>    <p>      <em>An Agricultural Testament,</em> Sir Albert Howard;      (Farber and Farber).
