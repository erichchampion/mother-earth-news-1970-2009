                    <h5 id="byline">      by VICTOR A. CROLEY    </h5>        <p>      When Grandma's chickens patrolled the farmyard they were      usually accompanied by one or more guineas that acted as      sentries and look-outs.</p><p>"Guineas warn when hawks are      about," explained Grandma. "And a screaming guinea will      frighten off almost any hawk or fox that tries to steal a      chicken"</p><p> She might have added that a clutch of guineas, all      screaming at once, would frighten off most two-legged      trespassers also . . . for the raucous screeching of these      otherwise modest and shy-appearing birds easily equals that      of the Beatles in their prime. </p><p>The guinea is a native of      Africa and several species are found in the west coast      country of Guinea from which they get their name.</p><p> In their      native habitat these game birds are highly prized by      hunters since a mature guinea will average three pounds in      weight and provides excellent eating. Guineas are sometimes      used to stock shooting preserves in England and it can be      little more than an oversight that similar efforts have not      been made in this country.</p><p> A great deal of patience as well      as large sums of money have been spent in attempts to      introduce exotic and oriental pheasants into the U.S. While      these efforts have met sensational success in the plains      areas of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming, they      have failed dismally in establishing the game birds in the      brushy, second-growth woodlands that cover millions of      acres in the Ozarks, Appalachians, and elsewhere. These      sections where pheasants have failed to survive would seem      to be ideally suited for the large-scale introduction of      guineas. In fact, it is in this area and around a few of      the larger cities that most of today's guineas are now      found . . . either as a few birds on the small family farms      or in larger numbers raised for a specialty market.</p><p> Guineas      have been domesticated for many centuries, and were raised      as table birds by the ancient Greeks and Romans. They were      brought to this country by the early colonists but wild      turkeys, pigeons and other game birds were so plentiful      that guineas were kept largely as a curiosity and for for      their watch-dog value. They could not compete with chickens      in egg production or as a convenience food, however, for      guineas demand a measure of independence and refuse to      accept the poultry yard confinement of chickens. They      prefer to roam over a large territory, rustle their food      from lodge grain, weed seeds, grasshoppers and other insect      and shun the barnyard and chicken-run.</p><p> It is for these      reasons we feel certain that guineas could be profitably      used to stock wilderness areas and hunting or game      preserves. A brace of two or three-pound guineas make a      satisfying trophy for most hunters and guineas could be      undomesticated and hunted in the wild like quail, pheasant      or grouse. This would certainly be a more humane and      satisfying procedure than raising them in captivity to be      released for shooting like the pigeons and ducks now      offered by many preserves. There are other possibilities      for profit in raising guineas that will occur to TMEN      readers. Growers near large cities have worked up      profitable mar kets for young guineas to be served in      gourmet restaurants, night clubs and flossy hotels in      exotic ways such as "game birds under glass." At twelve to      thirteen weeks a well-grown, tender young guinea will weigh      an average of one and a half to two pounds dressed and will      bring a premium price of two dollars per bird and tip. The      meat is darker than chicken, with a distinct game flavor      much enjoyed by those with educated palates. </p><p>Guinea      production on an extended scale presents some problems      which do not confront the chicken, duck or turkey grower.      Guineas make very poor mothers, hiding their nests with      unusual cleverness and laying a clutch of fifteen or twenty      eggs before beginning to brood. The hen is erratic about      brooding and may desert her nest for little or no reason.      When the first two or three chicks hatch, she may desert      the remaining eggs and take her young off on long ranges      through the dew-wet grass where the little ones sicken or      become lost while the chicks in the unhatched eggs die      a-borning. <br />vTo circumvent this, the guinea producer must      keep careful watch on the birds during the egg-laying      period to discover the hidden nests. He then removes all      but one or two marked eggs. In many cases this will induce      the hen to continue laying up to thirty and sometimes as      many as a hundred eggs before she becomes broody. The eggs      are then placed in an incubator or given to a setting      bantam or chicken hen who will hatch them and care for the      young guineas-which are properly called      "keets"-can be raised in confinement like chicken      broilers until they are twelve to thirteen weeks old and      ready for market. </p><p>When raised by a chicken mother, the      guinea keets recognize their own kind and return to their      free-ranging natural parents as they approach maturity.      Rarely will they confuse their heritage and cross with      chickens, but in the few instances when this has occurred      the hybrids have been sterile. </p><p>Unless the keets are raised      in confinement as described, there may be difficulty in      catching them when ready for market. Guineas dislike close      confinement and prefer to roost in trees even when they      roam with the poultry flock during the day. It is because      of this persistent atavistic trait of wildness that      un-domesticating the guinea would seem to offer the      back-to-the-land enthusiast so many possibilities for      success and profit.    </p>
