                    <h5 id="byline">      by JAMES E. CHURCHILL    </h5>        <p>      May is a time of abundance here in Wisconsin. The bitter      cold and snows of winter are gone and all but forgotten.      April rains have soaked the earth and awakened wild plants      that-warmed by the gentle May sun-are absorbing      minerals and manufacturing vitamins that will keep a food      forager clear-eyed and strong.<br />      <br />      Some of this fare that we find and make much use of are      alfalfa, clover, thistles, violets and sorrel. Occasionally      we even go into the forest to pick a basket of fern      shoots.<br />      <br />      Alfalfa and clover, of course, are hay plants raised by      commercial farmers for animal food. This makes finding them      easy since they grow almost everywhere. Alfalfa has been      raised since long before recorded history and it probably      was originally gown for human food. Well it might be too      since - in addition to protein - alfalfa is a      very good source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, sulphur,      sodium, potassium chlorine and silicon. These are called      trace elements and are often lacking in shallow rooted      plants but alfalfa - which can send its tap roots to      a depth of fifty feet - is unusually rich in these      nutrients. The plant is also one of the best sources of      vitamin K and contains enzymes that help the body to absorb      other foods. Nursing mothers can increase their flow of      milk by eating raw alfalfa or food containing the powdered      plant.<br />      <br />      For wilted alfalfa pick, wash and chop two cups of the      fresh plant and place in a frying pan. Pour two teaspoons      of vegetable oil or bacon grease into the pan and add salt      if desired. Heat and stir until the leaves have wilted. Eat      immediately.<br />      <br />      Alfalfa and whole wheat bread is a recipe that uses dried      alfalfa leaf flour. This flour can be purchased or you can      make your own by drying fresh alfalfa leaves in a warm room      or in a very slow oven until they're brittle enough to      powder between your fingers. We make powder by hand or use      our Corona Grain Mill set very fine to reduce the dried      leaves to flour.<br />      <br />      Measure out five cups whole grain wheat flour and 1/2 cup      alfalfa flour. Combine two cups scalded milk, 1-1/2      tablespoons bacon grease, one tablespoon salt and six      tablespoons molasses or honey. Dissolve one cake yeast in      1/4 cup lukewarm water and add two tablespoons of brown      sugar. Combine all ingredients and stir very well. Knead      slightly and place in a greased bowl in a warm room until      it doubles in bulk. Put the dough into two bread pans and      let it rise again until it doubles in bulk. Place in oven      and bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat      then to 325 degrees and bake until done . . . about 80      minutes in all. This bread should contain enough vitamins      and minerals to fill an entire specification book.<br />      <br />      Alfalfa flour can be sprinkled into soup or it can be eaten      raw. Many purists nibble the plant from hand right out in      the fields or after dipping it in salt water. Alfalfa also      combines well with other greens and it can be used with      clover to make a very appetizing salad.<br />      <br />      Pick and chop one cup of alfalfa and one cup white or fed      clover. Find some sorrel or grape leaves if you can and      chop and toss in enough of either or both to give the salad      a tang. Now toss and add - a teaspoonful at a time      - bacon grease or other dressing to give your salad      the flavor you like.<br />      <br />      Unlike alfalfa, clover can often be found growing in      wilderness areas . . . especially along logging roads and      in small clearings. Once, when I was fairly inexperienced      in finding edible wild plants, I went on a solo three day      "travel light and live off the land" backpack trip into the      Nicolet National Forest in Northern Wisconsin. On my second      day with little food I crossed a huge marsh, ciimbed the      hill on the other side and happened onto a patch of white      clover and sorrel growing side by side. I dropped my pack      right there and - pulling handsful of clover with one      hand and sorrel with the other - chewed as fast as I      could until the hollow in my stomach was filled. I've never      since passed a patch of white clover in the wilderness      without the warm feeling of seeing an old friend.<br />      <br />      Clover can be used in soups, vinegar and cough medicine.      The soup is made by adding a few fresh or dried leaves of      the plant to a beef stock soup. We don't overdo this      however. A small handful of leaves to a large pot of soup      is enough to start with. After tasting the soup, we add      more if desired. Too much will cause the dish to taste like      weeds.<br />      <br />      I've heard that vinegar can be made by pouring 1-1/2      gallons of boiling water over one gallon of tightly packed      red clover blooms. Let the mixture stand overnight and      strain out the blossoms. Add one pound of brown sugar and      1-1/2 pints molasses. Dissolve one cake yeast in 1/2 pint      water and add that also. Place the mixture in a stone crock      and let it stand in a warm room until it sours. This takes      awhile as the sugar must turn to alcohol and the alcohol to      acetic acid. One thing that might speed the process is a      very large stone crock that exposes more of the solution to      the air.<br />      <br />      Make cough medicine by adding one cup fresh red clover      blossoms to a pint of boiling water. Let it steep in a      covered earthen crock until cool and add one tablespoon      honey. Take a teaspoonful to control cough from colds,      whooping cough, virus, etc.<br />      <br />      If you're still not convinced that clover is a valuable      wild plant consider that Nebuchadnezzar II, King of      Babylon, would wander into the fields and eat handfuls of      clover when the pressures of ruling got too great. After a      few days he would return, much refreshed, and make some of      his most brilliant decisions. Might help at tax time.<br />      <br />      When we're gathering clover in our area we inevitably back      into or set down on a plant that is well protected by      nature: the thistle. Most grazing animals and people take      whatever steps are necessary to avoid thistles but we don't      because we know that the Canadian Thistle <em>(cirsium      arvense)</em> and the Bull Thistle <em>(cirsium      lanceolatum)</em> make good food. Even the sharp thorns are      edible after they boil awhile.    </p>              <p>Bull and Canadian Thistles spring up here in amazing    profusion. I've heard that the county has one    pseudo-bureaucrat who's sole duty in the summer is to see    that people cut their thistles before the plants go to seed.    I wish him well because - to find all the young tender    thistles I want for greens - all I have to do is watch    for his signs posted along the highways. Somewhere very near    there's certain to be a good patch of young thistles just    waiting to be made into boiled or creamed greens.<br />    <br />    I try to get young thistles when they're less than six inches    tall and cutting the plants involves some skillful    manipulation or the wearing of leather gloves. Sometimes a    bunch of thistles will seem to be alive the way they    porcupine around to stab you when you're not watching and I    place mine in a bag or box for carrying.<br />    <br />    I boil the chopped plants until their thorns are soft and    salt and serve them when the thistles are well cooked. The    first time you try eating the plant this way you'll feel like    Superman when you nonchalantly chomp down what - a few    minutes before - was a stabbing mess of needle-sharp    thorns. Thistles also make good creamed or wilted greens but,    because of the broth-like consistency they give to water, I    feel they make the best soup of any green plant.<br />    <br />    Make thistle soup by chopping (scissoring would be a better    word since an old pair of shears is the best thing I've found    for cutting up green plants) a pan of thistles. Push them    down in the pan and add just enough water to cover the    plants. Bring to a boil and let simmer for at least twenty    minutes. Now you can season this soup and eat it just as it    is or you can add some boiled fish, leftover rice or anything    else you happen to have. It's guaranteed to be good and you    can use this stock in stew.<br />    <br />    Chop and boil about six thistles until the water has absorbed    most of the juice from the plants. As they're boiling, add    water as needed until you have two quarts of very dark green    juice or soup stock. Remove the plant parts and set aside for    use as creamed greens. Add to the two quarts of stock, two    wild onions - tops and all - or medium chopped    domestic onion bulbs. Use less if you like only a mild onion    taste. Now add 1/2 pound of fish and 1/2 pound meat. The    combination of meat and fish that I like best is 1/2 pound    diced browned venison shin and 1/2 pound fillet of bullhead.    If you're still city bound, use 1/2 pound fish or fish heads    and six to eight chicken feet or one package of chicken necks    or backs.<br />    <br />    Chicken feet are rumored to be available at very small cost    in some city meat markets and I hear many people buy them for    "dog food". This is the best part of the chicken for making    soup but the feet do require parboiling for three minutes to    remove their scaly skin before they're placed in the soup.    The feet also can be chopped after parboiling and before    being put into the stock.<br />    <br />    <em>Anyway</em> , when you finally have your meat and fish    placed in the soup, add two cups cleaned and peeled arrow    head tubers or chopped potatoes, a few leaves of sorrel and    1/2 cup chopped cattail stems or celery stalks. Bring to a    boil, season well and simmer for about two hours. Taste    before removing from the fire and add seasoning if desired.    If anyone can think of a way to make a soup as good tasting    and nutritious as this for as little as this one costs I    would certainly like to hear about it.<br />    <br />    The thistle parts we set aside can be made into creamed    greens. Chop or blend the cooked thistle until it is as fine    as puree. Place in a saucepan over a slow fire, add three    tablespoons butter or bacon grease and add one or two small    onions, tops and all. Stir in 2-1/2 tablespoons of cattail or    wheat flour and add one cup of milk or milk substitute. Stir    and cook until all the ingredients are well blended. Crumble    in some crisp bacon if you have it and serve.<br />    <br />    When we gather thistles we try not to forget to pick a good    supply of sheep sorrel. Sheep sorrel is another wild plant    that was introduced to this country from Europe where it has    been raised as a pot herb for centuries.<br />    <br />    Sorrel, sheep sorrel, sour grass or red sorrel <em>(Rumex    Acetosella)</em> is a low bunch-like plant that grows in acid    soil. It has arrow-shaped leaves and shallow, yellowish root    stalks. Sorrel can be spotted from long distances by the    reddish tinge its seed pods give to the fields in which it    grows. The leaves of this perennial plant have a decidedly    sour taste and we use only the green leaves as they lose    almost everything when dry.</p>                  <p>      Sorrel combines well with other wild things and a good      salad can be made with one cup of sorrel leaves and a cup      of fresh dandelion crowns. The crown is the white part of      the dandelion between the green part of the leaf and the      root. Slice the crown into small pieces and soak out any      dirt. Crispen the sections in cold water if necessary. Now      add some leaves of the sweet clover <em>(Melilotus      Officinalis),</em> too. Not many, just enough to smooth the      flavor of the dandelion and sorrel. This salad can be eaten      without dressing or it can be tossed with a couple strips      of crisp fried bacon, grease and all.<br />      <br />      For cream of sorrel soup pick, wash and scissor into small      pieces two tightly packed cups of sorrel leaves (strip the      leaves from the rib and discard it). Heat four tablespoons      of bacon grease or butter. Stir in the scissored sorrel      leaves and cook until very well browned, being careful not      to burn them. Place in four quart soup pan and add a      tablespoon of whole gain wheat flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt and      four cups of milk. This can be cow milk, goat milk, soy      bean milk or thistle soup stock. Cover the pot and simmer      for 1/2 hour. Add black pepper and serve hot.<br />      <br />      To brew some sorrel and mint tea, place a double handful of      sorrel leaves and a teaspoon of dried mint leaves in a tea      pot. Cover with boiling water and let it steep for ten      minutes. Drink hot or cold. This tea contains vitamins      which will combat intestinal worms, kidney stones and      hepatitis. Besides that it's very good, especially if      sweetened with one teaspoon of honey to each cup of      tea.<br />      <br />      Sorrel also can be made into a meat sauce, especially if      you have a blender. Dissolve 1-1/2 tablespoons of honey in      three tablespoons of hot water. Cool and add 1/2 cup finely      chopped sorrel leaves and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar. Make      this early enough so the ingredients can set together for      at least 30 minutes (but not more than two hours) before      using. Now that we've explored some of sorrel's      possibilities let's take a walk into the moist woods where      we can find another plant that is just coming into its own      for food purposes.<br />      <br />      About the middle of May, in the cool forests of Wisconsin,      ferns send up their green succulent stems. I know exactly      where the fern plantations will be because I spotted them      last summer when they were two feet high and so thick that      the forest floor wasn't visible.<br />      <br />      I first became interested in ferns for food when I read      Louise Dickenson Rich's book, <em>We Took To The      Woods,</em> many, many years ago. However, I don't think      she gave the fern true credit when she said it tasted like      a cross between asparagus and swamp water.<br />      <br />      I pick ferns when they're about six to ten inches high.      They're best before they've unfolded and while their heads      are still hanging down in a prayer position. I break the      plants off just above the ground and use heads, stems and      all. I've heard that the fern leaf, when mature, contains a      poison so I don't attempt to use the plants for food after      the leaves develop.<br />      v Some people let the ferns develop a little longer and      pick them just as the tiny leaves start to emerge. These      folks don't use the immature leaves, however. They cut the      stalks off just under them and slightly above where the      stems are starting to get tough. This makes a finished      product that looks like asparagus.<br />      <br />      The two species of ferns that I depend on for food are the      common bracken fern <em>(Pteridium Aquilinum)</em> and      cinnamon fern <em>(Osmunda Cinnamona).</em> Cinnamon fern,      of course, is the common "fiddlehead" that is sold      commercially along the Atlantic coast. Wherever you live,      however, there should be at least one species of this plant      that will provide you with tasty "asparagus" in the early      spring.<br />      vThe bracken fern matures into a tall, thick-stalked plant      with great triangular leaves. It grows - usually on      high, well-drained and poorer soil - in huge patches      that cover the ground in both fields and forests. Here in      Wisconsin, the bracken is often found in cutover areas that      have reseeded themselves to poplar trees.<br />      <br />      Cinnamon ferns usually grow in rich soil at the edge of or      in swamps and wet areas. They're generally later than the      brackens due, no doubt, to the longer time it takes for      spring to come to the marshlands. The shoots, when they      first come up, are reddish and exceedingly hairy with      tightly rolled heads. These heads gradually form into      upright seed or spore pods and, later, the leaves of the      plants come up.<br />      <br />      So far as I know there are no poisonous ferns if the new      shoots only are eaten. I prepare these plants by pulling      the shoots between my fingers to strip away the "wool" and      then boiling the stalks in salted water for a few minutes      until they're tender. Serve like asparagus with salt and      melted butter.    </p>        <p>      Health food enthusiasts would probably rather steam ferns.      To do this, pick, wash and strip a bunch of shoots (a good      handful or two pounds). Tie the bunch together and place      them stalk down in a large pan or double boiler. Add 1-1/2      inches of water and cover the pan and fern tips with      another pan. Bring to a boil and hold for about ten minutes      or until the stalks are tender. Remove, drain and keep the      liquid. Slice the cooked ferns crossways with a sharp      knife, place in a bowl and stir in 1/2 cup chopped hickory      nuts, 1/3 cup of vegetable oil and the original liquid from      cooking the ferns. Return to the fire warm up to a simmer      and hold for five minutes. Pour over thin, whole grain,      wheat bread toast.<br />      <br />      Almost everyone knows the delightful purple or blue flower      of the violet. This flower grows in almost every moist,      cool woods in the country and many ladies raise violets in      their flower gardens for the delightful color and fragrance      of the blossom.<br />      <br />      The violet is a very good food plant and has been used      since the beginning of records for food and medicine. The      whole plant can be eaten: the blossoms in violet jam, the      leaves and stalks in salads and the roots - if you      care to go to the trouble - roasted. for a      vegetable.<br />      v Violet blossoms make a very good drink when mixed with      wild honey and sumac juice. Pick any size container full of      the blooms. One good way to do this in quantity is to use      your fingers, slightly spread and palm up, as a rake to      slide through bunches where they grow thickly. Even when      the flowers are scattered, however, picking a pint or so is      no formidable task. Place the blossoms in an enameled pan,      cover with sumac juice which you have measured and bring to      a slow boil. When the liquid just starts to roll, add one      teaspoon of honey to each cup of liquid. Remove from the      fire and set aside to cool and blend for about one hour.      Drink hot or cold.<br />      <br />      If I have a good handful of violet blossoms left over after      preparing this drink I make some violet pudding.<br />      v Place a cup of tightly packed violet blossoms in a tea      pot or pan that can be covered. Add 1-1/2 cups of boiling      water and let steep until cool. In the meantime, mix      together four teaspoons of gelatine and 1/4 cup cold water      in a pan. Add 3/4 cup honey, 1/4 teaspoon sea salt and 1/2      cup lemon juice. Now pour the violet tea over the mixture      in the pail, place over heat and bring to a boil while      stirring constantly. Remove from the fire, cool, pour into      a mold and chill until firm.<br />      v Violets can be used in salads also. Cut up leaves -      blossoms and all - and mix them into any salad. Or      chop leaves and stems only and wilt them in bacon grease      over a low fire . . . or just go out in the violet patch      and sit down and eat the blooms. Anyway you do it, you'll      be getting a prodigious dose of ascorbic acid and vitamin      A. Don't presume to eat a year's supply in one day,      however, as - like most fresh greens - violets      are a mild laxative.<br />      <br />      Good luck. See you next issue.    </p>
