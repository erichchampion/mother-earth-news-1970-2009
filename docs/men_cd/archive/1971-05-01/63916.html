                		<h5 id="byline">      by C. MISHLER    </h5>		<p>      My husband and I once lived in Mexico for five years and,      while there, I was constantly puzzled by the Mexican's term      for giving birth: "to bring to the light". Such a blessed      refer ence to an experience which I had always thought of      as horrible didn't make sense at all.    </p>    <p>      It didn't make sense-that is-until Dick and I      studied on our own, learned to ignore the scare tales with      which we were flooded and brought our third child to the      light by ourselves in our own home. Now-nine years      later-I've had two more children the same way and am      teaching the Lamaze Method of Training for Childbirth to      other couples. Naturally, I've developed some ideas on the      subject that I'd like to share.    </p>    <p>      First and foremost, if you want to have your baby at home,      be very, very faithful about pre-natal checkups. The      <em>slightest</em> indication of possible trouble should      send you to a hospital for the birth.    </p>    <p>      Really good nutrition (read Adelle Davis) is another      important part of preparing for childbirth: natural and      unrefined foods, lots of fruits and vegetables . . . you      know what I mean.    </p>    <p>      The study of some method of birth "training" is also      extremely vital. I prefer Lamaze, having found it most      effective in my own experience and having seen it work over      and over for the parents I've instructed. Lamaze or not,      however, you should know-and know well-some way      of controlling the possible pain and discomfort of a      delivery. Wide-awake parents, who are informed and aware of      what is happening during normal birth and who know what to      do to keep the mother comfortable and to assist-not      impede-nature, are vitally important in any delivery      . . . and <em>especially</em> so for home deliveries.    </p>    <p>      You should also (unless you're an Amazon) have a third      person-in addition to the mother and      father-take the childbirth training with you. A      mother in labor should not be left alone and we always have      a trusted adult (someone we vibe with) handy to run      errands, fetch water, etc,    </p>    <p>      It will be ideal if you can find a doctor who will come and      assist if needed and not interfere when not needed. It will      also be unlikely. Right or wrong-to avoid      hassles-we've learned to simply not tell anyone when      we're planning something so outrageous as having a baby in      our own home.    </p>    <p>      You should be making other preparations as the time for      delivery approaches. Have the bed protected with rubber or      plastic sheets several weeks in advance, in case the water      breaks at night. We used newspapers on the bed for our      first home delivery but found them too crackly and didn't      repeat that idea. When you know for certain you're in labor      remove the plastic, make the bed with clean sheets, put the      plastic back on over the linen and then put another clean      sheet on top of the plastic. After the birth you'll be able      to strip down to the underneath sheets and have a clean,      fresh bed again with little hassle.    </p>    <p>      You won't need great tubs of boiling water although a good      potful is handy to wash mother with after the birth and      some doctors and midwives used to apply warm wet towels to      the perineum (where baby's head emerges) to soften the      muscles and help stretching.    </p>    <p>      Gather together a large batch of clean rags, old towels,      etc. during the pregnancy. Launder them well, dry them in      the sun and wrap them to keep them clean. You'll find these      cloths useful as pads to catch leaking fluids under mother.    </p>    <p>      Have some baby clothes ready, where your assistant can find      them easily . . . and be sure your room, igloo, tipi or      whatever is WARM. One couple I heard of recently had a cold      wind sweeping into the birthing room through cracks and      broken windows. The mother-to-be was in great      discomfort-not from labor-but from COLD. And      remember: that little baby will experience a drop of about      twenty degrees when born, even if the room is over 70Â°      F. So don't cool it, <em>warm it.</em>    </p>    <p>      I'm not going into all the training information here. I      don't think you should attempt to learn how to have a baby      at home from a magazine article-or even a complete      book or books, for that matter-anyway. Make every      attempt to find a good instructor: first-rate training is      worth going some distance for. And once you know what      you're doing, practice and practice and practice what      you'll actually do during your delivery. If you want to      reap the rewards of "going it on your own", in other words,      you must expect to pay the proper dues.    </p>    <p>      We've found that boiled shoestring makes a good,      unbreakable tie for the cord once the baby is born. This      tying is not the Great Mystery the medical profession would      have you believe. You simply boil the shoestring and      scissors a half hour, cover and leave until needed. Then      you tie a knot tightly around the cord a few inches from      baby and make another tie-again, very tightly-a      few inches from that and cut between.*    </p>    <p>      Putting the baby to the breast soon after birth helps      prevent excessive bleeding from the mother. If the placenta      (afterbirth) doesn't come spontaneously soon after the      birth <em>get a doctor.</em> I've heard of Indian mothers      who expelled afterbirth by getting on their knees, crossing      their arms over their tummys and bending over. Maybe it      works . . . I don't know. If you have any trouble, my      advice remains: <em>get a doctor.</em>    </p>    <p>      If you're planning to have a baby at home you're sure to      get a lot of "Think of the risk . . . you're jeopardizing      your baby. . . what if you die!?" etc., etc. ad nauseaum.      Of course, there is some justification for this talk . . .      but did you know that-in countries where home      delivery is the usual procedure for normal births-the      infant and maternal mortality rate is actually LOWER than      it is in this country.    </p>    <p>      That's right. It's safer to have a baby in England, Sweden,      the Netherlands and about ten other countries where normal      deliveries at home are considered "standard", than it is to      have a baby here in the United States where intricate and      almost-mechanized deliveries are rapidly becoming the norm.      To put it another way: complications during birth can and      do take place . . . but not nearly as often as the Nervous      Nellies would like us to believe.    </p>    <p>      THERE IS NO LAW STATING THAT BABIES MUST BE BORN IN      HOSPITALS. Don't let anyone con you into thinking there is.      Such a law would be unconstitutional. Home is a groovy      place to give birth and having a baby there minimizes the      trauma for all family members, especially other children.    </p>    <p>      After much thought and five babies of my own I've come to      feel that I much prefer the joy, sense of oneness with      husband and baby <em>and the risks</em> of home delivery to      the "maybe safe" alternative of the cold, de-humanized,      antiseptic and unsatisfactory delivery increasingly offered      by the medical profession. After all, it's not MY fault for      desiring a good experience . . . it's THEIRS for not      offering one.    </p>    <p>      Thank God that a few wonderful hospitals and doctors are      now waking up to the growing need for more awareness of the      vital human values inherent in the birth experience. These      enlightened souls are actually trying to provide hospital      safety without sacrificing human warmth and, in some      countries, mobile emergency maternity units-that      contain all the equipment which might be needed and that      are parked outside the home during delivery-have been      built. This trend should be encouraged and, I'm sure, will      develop in response to people's demands. You can help this      "liberation movement" by writing letters to hospitals,      doctors, departments of health and newspapers presenting      your views.    </p>    <p>      So kiddies, to sum up ole Gran's advice: If you intend to      have a baby at home, study and prepare and have all      necessary supplies ready beforehand. If you have to visit      every doctor within 50 miles to find one you dig and that      digs natural childbirth, do so. If you can't find such a      doctor, <em>at least keep on going to the best one you can      find for your regular checkups</em> and hunt up someone who      can train you, your husband and a close friend in one of      the good (such as Lamaze) delivery techniques.    </p>    <p>      If you're a longhair, ward off any showdown with the Public      Health people right in front by keeping your pad      scrupulously clean and by complying with the laws regarding      birth certificates.    </p>    <p>      If there is any indication of trouble before or during      labor, go to a hospital or get a doctor to come      immediately.    </p>    <p>      Having babies at home is not modern nor approved nor even      recommended today . . . but an increasing number of folks      are choosing to believe that it is both dignified and RIGHT      to do so. It's time the medical profession faced the fact      and took steps to provide safety and care for delivery in      the home. That's where babies were meant to be born.    </p>    <p>      Good luck. Let me know how it goes for you.    </p>    <p>      C. Mishler<br />      501 S. Court St.<br />      Visalia, California 93277<br />    </p>    <p>      * JOHN STARR, M.D. COMMENTS: Contrary to popular belief,      boiling is <em>not</em> a guaranteed effective way of      killing germs on either scissors or the material used to      tie an umbilical cord. Heat resistant tetanus and hepatitis      germs can be killed only by pressure cooking the objects to      be sterilized at maximum pressure setting for at least 20      minutes.    </p>    <p>      Surgical gloves (sterile and disposable, size 7 or 8)      should be worn when tying baby's cord or whenever touching      any area of mother injured in birth.    </p>    <p>      Tetanus (in the baby) and childbed fever (in the mother)      can result from improper sterilizing techniques and from      not using gloves and masks to perform the delivery.      Surgical masks and gloves are available from a physician's      supply house (see the yellow pages).    </p>    <p>      SIX LESSONS FOR EASIER CHILDBIRTH, Elisabeth Bing; Grosset,      $4.95.<br />      HUSBAND COACHED CHILDBIRTH, Robert A.
