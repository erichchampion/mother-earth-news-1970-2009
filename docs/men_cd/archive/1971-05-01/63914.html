                    <h5 id="byline">      by MARTHA STRATTON    </h5>        <p>      Atter living some time in Holland-where natural      childbirth is the accepted form of delivery-and after      preparing myself by reading and practicing the exercises in      THE NEW CHILDBIRTH by Erna Wright, our first child was born      last summer in England by the Lamaze method.    </p>    <p>      I feel I was well prepared by the six months of exercises I      had done and the weeks of breathing practice I had      undergone with the help of a local clinic's midwife. Still,      the labor was long and hard.    </p>    <p>      The delivery, however, was short and easy . . . with my      husband right there holding my left foot and propping my      head for most efficient breathing. I would have hated to      have been under anesthetic and missed the thrill of feeling      my baby slither out like a fish!    </p>    <p>      When my husband took a job in England for the period of      time in which we expected the baby, I looked for an English      doctor who would cooperate with natural childbirth. In      Hampshire County where we were living, however, it is      customary for first babies to be delivered in hospital and      only later babies to be delivered at home by a midwife,      usually with a doctor in attendance.    </p>    <p>      The doctor we settled on was not keen on the idea of      natural childbirth for a first baby; nor did he especially      want my husband in the delivery room. When he saw how      adamant we were, however, he agreed. With that out of the      way, the doctor and nursing staff (all trained midwives) of      the maternity division of the Royal Hampshire Hospital in      Winchester did everything they could to help us have the      baby the way we wanted.    </p>    <p>      I was in hospital for nine days as is customary in England      where (although I did not qualify) hospitalization is paid      for by National Health. The baby roomed in all day every      day and was out of my quarters only to be bathed or if he      made such a fuss at night that I couldn't sleep.    </p>    <p>      I think "rooming in" is wonderful and was happy to have had      the experience of getting to know my baby and really      learning how to care for him before we were on our own      together. They brought him in to nurse for the first time      when he was three hours old and-at this      writing-he is 8 months old and hasn't had a bottle      yet.    </p>    <p>      Our baby is such an alert, healthy and happy child that I      can't help feeling that the psychological and physical      preparation I went through, as well as the breast feeding,      has really paid off.    </p>    <p>      Because childbirth is such a strenuous physical event, you      should train for it as you would an athletic contest and      the Lamaze pre-natal exercises in Erna Wright's THE NEW      CHILDBIRTH take only fifteen minutes a day. Mrs. Wright is      an English midwife and her book is a series of lectures      about pregnancy and childbirth that she gives to classes of      expectant mothers and fathers. Each lecture is followed by      a short course of exercises planned to prepare the mother's      body for the job it must do. The exercises build on one      another and are assisted by controlled breathing which      helps the mother control her body and relax during labor      and delivery.    </p>    <p>      If Erna Wright's book helped me in the physical and      psychological areas, Adelle Davis' LET'S HAVE HEALTHY      CHILDREN was equally important in my nutritional      preparation. Mrs. Davis suggests building your body      nutritionally for at least one year before your child is      conceived. Her book covers the pre-natal period, the      child's diet from birth through the pre-school years and      gives advice on both breast feeding and bottle feeding a      baby.    </p>    <p>      Two other books complete my "childbirth shelf" of necessary      information: PREGNANCY AND BIRTH by Dr. Alan Guttmacher and      THE RIGHTS OF INFANTS by Dr. Margaret A. Ribble. Dr.      Guttmacher's book answers all the possible questions you      might have about what is happening physically to your body      during pregnancy and what delivery is like while Dr.      Ribble's book will help you cope psychologically with this      new being once he is born.    </p>    <p>      LET'S HAVE HEALTHY CHILDREN, Adelle Davis, Revised Edition,      1959, New York, Harcourt, Brace & World. $5.75.<br />      PREGNANCY AND BIRTH, Alan Guttmacher, Signet, $.75, (paper      ).<br />      THE RIGHTS OF INFANTS, Margaret Ribble, New York, Columbia      University Press, 0943.<br />      THE NEW CHILDBIRTH, Erna Wright, 1968, Hart Publishing, 510      Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y., 10011.
