        <h1 id="title">      Making Your Own Peat Pellets    </h1><h5 id="byline">      by JOHN FUNK    </h5><p>      REMEMBER THOSE GREAT LITTLE PEAT PELLET PLANT STARTERS THAT      JACK ROLAND COGGINS WROTE ABOUT IN MOTHER NO. 8 . . .      GREAT, THAT IS, EXCEPT FOR THE NON-BIODEGRADEABLE NYLON      THAT THE MANUFACTURER INSISTS ON WRAPPING THEM WITH. WELL,      JOHN FUNK SAYS YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN-SWADDLED IN GOOD      OLE ORGANIC COTTON CLOTH-RIGHT AT HOME. THEY WON'T BE      AS PRETTY AS STORE-BOUGHT AND EVEN JOHN HOPES YOU'LL      IMPROVE ON HIS IDEA . . . BUT IT'S A DARN GOOD START ON    </p><p>      The peat pellet article in Mother No. 8 really grabbed me.      Here was technology at its best: a simple, convenient way      to get around at least half the heavy directions and      frightening illustrations tucked away in my      innocent-looking new gardening books. Why, armed with ten      or twelve dollars worth of pellets, even we city folk could      easily get back to the land-by first bringing the      land into the house. My head was off and running, and then      . . . I stumbled into the author's note.    </p><p>      Plastic mesh! Peat pellets were a technical miracle all      right . . . neatly packaged in an ecological disaster.      Score another point for the opposition. I just couldn't see      adding plastic to gardens when lawns and streets were      already filled with the stuff. Write the manufacturer?      Forget it. I had about decided to chuck the whole idea when      another look at the gardening books convinced me that, if I      had to have a garden, I had to have peat pellets. And I'd      do away with the plastic by making my own.    </p><p>      In order to duplicate the little buggers I did buy one box      of the ready-mades and found that peat pellets are actually      flat peat discs. These discs look and feel as though      they've died violently in a 50 ton hydraulic press but,      with a little water, they instantly spring back to life as      perfectly-shaped little peat pots.<br /></p><p>      Now the pellets I'm going to tell you how to make won't be      quite that professional. They'll look more like a bloated      poker chip than a disc and, once expanded, more like a      meatball than a flower pot. But don't worry. They      <em>will</em> do the job, and they won't leave a plastic      shell behind-because they're "skinned" with genuine,      old-fashioned, cotton cheesecloth. Come September, your      pellets will each be a happily rotting mess!    </p><p>      I don't suppose you happen to own one of those      aforementioned 50-ton presses. I sure don't, so I was      forced to invent my very own Super-Special Tin Can Peat      Pellet Mini-Press. The compression power is supplied by an      automotive hydraulic jack working against a relatively      immovable object like the underside of a pickup truck (most      cars are too low to the ground) or the underside of      basement stairs (an iron fire escape would be even better).      I don't know if I have a "better" press-no one's      beaten a path to my door-but the path to my garden      leads all over the house to every available patch of      sunlight.    </p><p>      Once you've set up your own mini-press, you'll be able to      crank out pellets at the rate of one every two minutes. By      the strict standards of a computer, I know this is darn      slow; but the alternative-a monster machine and      plastic in the garden-just ain't acceptable. Anyway,      the list of materials and tools with this article contains      everything you'll need. Scrounge the stuff together and      let's begin..    </p><p>      Our mini-press needs only"one cylinder (a recycled tin can)      and one piston (a wooden stick faced with the tops of two      cans). It's quite easy to build.    </p><p>      First, the hard part. Open two frozen juice cans and drink      the contents. Save both lids, but forget about or put aside      one can. The remaining can is now called a compression      cylinder.    </p><p>      To make the piston, place the two lids together, start two      nails through them near the center and nail the lids to the      bottom of the 6-inch-long stick. The resulting piston      should be able to slide in and out of the can without      binding.    </p><p>      That's it! That's the heart of your peat press.    </p><p><strong>OTHER PREPARATIONS</strong></p><p>      Spagnum contains a lot of roots, twigs, and other organic      matter and will not compress without first being sifted.      Sift tree stuff through a wire mesh sieve into a large      mixing bowl, and throw the leftover debris into your garden      or compost. Now put the bowl aside, or better yet, con      someone else into continuing the job while you go on to      fight with the cheesecloth.    </p><p>      Cheesecloth has got to be the softest, most      difficult-to-work-with material I have ever seen. Unless      you have a <em>very</em> large table, work on the floor.      Otherwise you'll wear yourself out just trying to keep the      miserable stuff on your work surface. Since it's almost      impossible to mark cheesecloth, you'll have to resort to      the old trick of making a pattern to cut the material      around. A 6-inch square of cardboard works nicely for this.    </p><p>      Slip the square pattern under one edge of the cheesecloth      and start cutting . . . don't worry, you'll be able to see      the cardboard very well. If you insist on putting the      pattern on top, go ahead but you won't be able to see the      cloth and it will really squirm when you start hacking.      Since cheesecloth comes 34 inches wide, each yard will      yield 25 squares plus a strip of scrap 4" wide.    </p><p>      After you have successfully cut out a couple yard's worth      of squares, you can go on to setting up the mini-press and      mashing a few pellets.<br /></p><p><strong>PRODUCTION</strong></p><p>      This is the really fun job which everybody tries to corner      for himself. If you're working with others, begin      immediately while they're busy sifting and cutting, and      you'll be into it really heavy before they discover what      you're up to.    </p><p>      First put one tablespoon of water in the compression      cylinder. Now lay down a cheesecloth square, measure out      1/2 cup of tightly-packed peat and carefully dump the mess      into the cloth's center. Gather together each of the four      corners of the cloth to form a kind of square bag with side      slits and twist the bag until you've closed the slits.      Secure the loose ends with a piece of wire, half a pipe      cleaner or a bread wrapper twist and very gently squeeze      the peat bag, wired side up, into the compression cylinder.    </p><p>      Now for the action. Set the cylinder and contents on the 3"      X 3"-square piece of wood, and place both on the business      end of the jack. Lower the piston into place and begin      pumping the jack's handle or turning the screw on a screw      jack. You'll have to hold the cylinder with your other hand      until the top of the piston makes contact with the truck or      whatever you're compressing against. Increase the pressure      gradually. Remember, you're only trying to press a little      peat . . . not jack up the truck or rip out the      stairs.<br /></p><p>      You can determine proper pressure by grasping the cylinder      and trying to pull it sideways. Can you pull it away from      the jack? If not, you've probably got enough pressure.    </p><p>      Now wait at least two minutes while the old      pounds-per-square-inch formula does the job on the peat. If      you're the type who can't stand waiting-not even for      two minutes-you can use the time to good advantage by      locating the <em>other</em> juice can, dumping in the      water, and stuffing peat bag down its throat. Okay, time's      up. Release the jack, remove the piston, and take a peek.    </p><p>      You should be looking at a white mass at the very bottom of      the cylinder and-hopefully-you'll be able to      see the wire you used to tie the bag. With a knife or      screwdriver, carefully pry the pellet from the cylinder,      untie the wire . . . and you're done!    </p><p>      Now when you pull a peat pellet off the shelf for a fast      and neat planting job, you'll be sure you're pressing your      favorite seed into a <em>completely</em> bio-degradable      home-made miracle.    </p>
