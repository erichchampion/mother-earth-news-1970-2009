                    <h2 id="subtitle">      <strong>REWARDS VS. RISKS</strong>    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by JOHN STARR, M.D.    </h5>    <p>      <em>MOTHER worries at the thought of a reader trying to      deliver her baby at home with nothing but a recommended      book propped beside her and I do not, in any way, suggest      or encourage such a foolhardy practice. On the other hand,      I am increasingly aware that numerous readers of this      publication have had-or are planning-"natural"      or home deliveries . . . often with only the sketchiest      information and large amounts of wishful thinking to guide      them.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Perhaps this brief review of natural and home      deliveries and the risks involved-while not to be      interpreted as a guide to nor endorsement of the      idea-will at least offer you some honest information      on the subject. I suggest that-after you digest this      feature and the books recommended by the various      authors-you contact</em> THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR      PSYCHOPROPHYLAXIS IN OBSTETRICS, 36 West 96th St., New      York, N.Y. 10025 <em>and</em> THE INTERNATIONAL CHILDBIRTH      EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, P.O. Box 5852, Milwaukee, Wisconsin      <em>for more information. Then, after consulting further      with your own doctor and local childbirth organizations,      you'll be in a firm position to make your own decision in      the matter.</em>    </p>    <p>      As recently as 1935, 65% of all babies born in the United      States were delivered at home. At present, slightly less      than 5% of this country's mothers deliver at home. Maternal      deaths, during the same time interval, were cut from 60 per      10,000 to 5 per 10,000 and-as might be      expected-the medical profession generally seems to      feel that there's a direct correlation between the two sets      of figures.<br />    </p>    <p>      Some of us are not so easily persuaded by that reasoning,      however. We know that much of this reduction in risk to a      mother is due to the discovery of antibiotics and the      widespread adoption of prenatal checkups (which detect and      ward off complications of pregnancy before the actual      delivery).    </p>    <p>      We also know that few medical people are apt to seek out      and publicize the ways in which home deliveries actually      <em>reduce</em> the risks involved in childbirth. For      example, a mother at home will usually be watched and      attended far more faithfully than she would if she were in      a hospital; she will be less anxious in many cases; she      will be much less likely to receive drugs which might      poison the baby; her delivery will not be rushed by an      obstetrician who is anxious to get on to something else;      the baby will not be exposed to the virulent staphylococcus      germs which breed in hospital nurseries.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, serious complications can develop during      any birth and such complications can definitely represent a      larger danger to both mother and child in a wilderness      cabin than when encountered in a hospital. If you decide to      have your baby at home (after having gone through      properly-supervised prenatal care) with an experienced      nurse, midwife or MD in attendance, the odds are about one      in 50 that something will happen during labor and delivery      to send you to a hospital. Once in every 200 home      deliveries that "something" will be potentially      life-threatening.    </p>    <p>      Yes, this is entirely "natural". Even wild animals      occasionally have trouble delivering and any farmer can      tell you of complications he's had delivering a cow of her      calf. It is pointless to deny-no matter how good your      "vibes"-that problems can occur. It's much better if      you know about these potential complications      <em>before</em> than <em>after</em> they happen and the      following description of some of the worst is not meant to      scare, but to inform.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TWINS, TRIPLETS, ETC.</strong>    </p>    <p>      One in every 89 deliveries results in twins and only 60% of      twin pregnancies are recognized as such prior to the actual      birth . . . so they can be quite a surprise.    </p>    <p>      A mother may suspect that she's carrying twins if her      abdomen is much bigger than seems normal and, if you have      sensitive hands you can sometimes distinguish two hard,      round baby heads instead of one when you touch the mother's      abdomen. If you want to make a more professional check for      twins, get a stethoscope at any physician's supply house      and listen for the rapid tic-tac of the unborn baby's      heart. If you hear two heart beats at different points over      the abdomen (and particularly if there's more than 10 beats      a minute difference in the pulse count) you can practically      assume you have twins coming. The diagnosis can be      confirmed by X-ray if there's any doubt.    </p>    <p>      Now twins, triplets and other multiple births are great to      have in the family once they're delivered but,      unfortunately, they frequently are born hind end first      <em>(breech birth)</em> and that's a difficult form of      delivery. They're also smaller in size (hence weaker for a      time) and are more apt to get sick following delivery.    </p>    <p>      Twins could be delivered at home and everything might go OK      but, if I was called upon to supervise the delivery, I      would be jumpy until both babies were out and doing well.      Any twin (any baby, in fact) weighing under four pounds      would have a better chance if taken to a hospital nursery.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S PELVIS TOO SMALL</strong>    </p>    <p>      In about 1-2% of hospital deliveries the mother's pelvis is      too small for the baby to be born. This is usually caused      by rickets (vitamin D deficiency) which resulted in a      misshapen pelvic as the mother', bone structure was being      developed.    </p>    <p>      A doctor or midwife generally suspects this complication      (called <em>cephalopelvic disproportion)</em> early in      pregnancy and can advise against home delivery. In some      cases, however, the condition is not noticed until labor      has persisted longer than normal with no progress of the      baby's head through the birth passageway.    </p>    <p>      The usual duration of labor for a first baby is about 12-14      hours. Labor lasts about 6-8 hours for subsequent children      and, if a mother has already had one child, you can      generally assume that her pelvis is of adequate size for a      later pregnancy.    </p>    <p>      In the event that a mother's pelvis is too small (or the      baby's head is too large), labor will simply continue for      days and a <em>Ceasarian section</em> (the operation which      removes a baby through a surgical incision into the      abdomen) will have to be performed. A hospital is      definitely the best place for such an operation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ABNORMAL PRESENTATIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      When a part of the baby other than its head comes out      first, the birth is known as an abnormal presentation and      most knowledgeable people worry a great deal about      delivering an abnormally presenting baby at home. The odds      of such a birth are about one in 20 hospital deliveries.      Get your M.D., nurse or midwife to show you how to feel the      baby's head and wiggle it just above the pubic bone to make      sure your baby is presenting its head first.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BLEEDING FROM A MISPLACED PLACENTA</strong>    </p>    <p>      This complication occurs in about one of every 200 hospital      deliveries. Instead of growing on the side of the uterus      where it should, the placenta grows over the mouth of the      uterus, interfering with the passage of the baby. The      symptom to watch for is continuous bleeding from the vagina      either before labor or after labor begins. A "mucus plug"      which is passed with a small amount of blood (called a      "bloody show") early in labor is normal and should not      cause alarm.    </p>    <p>      Misplaced placenta (placenta previa) is a very serious      complication because of the rapid and severe bleeding which      occurs. It is usually necessary to do a C-section to avoid      catastrophe in the event of a misplaced placenta and, if      bleeding occurs during labor, you've got some hard thinking      to do in a hurry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BLEEDING AFTER DELIVERY</strong>    </p>    <p>      At the time the placenta is expelled from the uterus, what      seems like an amazing amount of blood is also expelled.      This is normal but it's a good idea to have someone on hand      who knows how much bleeding is OK and how much is too much.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes a fragment of placenta is retained in the uterus      following delivery. When this happens, the uterus does not      flex its muscles to stop bleeding and you will notice      thatinstead of feeling like a firm orange when you massage      it below the belly button-the uterus is large and      flabby. Blood loss from this condition can be rapid.    </p>    <p>      If the complication develops, the baby should be placed at      the mother's breast and her blood pressure checked      frequently. If the bleeding continues, the mother's pulse      becomes rapid and weak or her blood pressure starts to      fall, you've got a problem. The mother needs qualified help      immediately to evacuate the retained placental fragment and      start a blood transfusion . . . and that means a hospital.    </p>    <p>      The average amount of blood lost during a normal delivery      is about a cupful. Loss of over two cupfuls is worrisome      and occurs in about one in 20 hospital deliveries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PREMATURE LABOR</strong>    </p>    <p>      If labor begins a month or more before the baby is due to      arrive, it can be predicted that the child will be small      and weak (a premature infant). Such deliveries are tricky      and should not be conducted at home. Certainly, any baby      which weighs less than four pounds at birth is much more      apt to get seriously sick in the days following delivery      than is a baby of average weight. Low birth-weight babies      also chill rapidly and should be put in a warm place as      soon after birth as possible.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMPRESSION OF THE UMBILICAL CORD</strong>    </p>    <p>      If the umbilical cord (which carries blood to the baby)      slips past the baby's head and into the vagina, the cord      will be compressed during the passage of the baby. This      causes a shutting off of the baby's blood supply and the      complication is estimated to occur about once in every 300      hospital deliveries.    </p>    <p>      Although cord compression does not threaten the mother, it      will frequently result in a dead baby unless a rapid      delivery of the child (usually by C-section) can be      performed.    </p>    <p>      A trained person would feel the cord by doing a vaginal      examination, would place the mother in the knees-to-chest      position (have nurse, midwife or M.D. show you how) to      reduce pressure on the cord and would rush the mother to a      hospital.    </p>    <p>      Compression of the umbilical cord is much more apt to occur      during breech deliveries; less likely when the baby's head      is presenting. The complication is one of several      conditions which may make the baby's heart rate (listened      to over the abdomen) drop below 100-per-minute and which      may cause the passage of watery and greenish baby stool      from the mother's vagina during labor. Another possible      cause of such symptoms is medication which a doctor      sometimes gives the mother for pain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INFECTION OF BABY AFTER DELIVERY</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you run a test on any 100 women, 5 will probably have      gonorrhea germs even though they have no symptoms. If a      baby is infected with gonorrhea during delivery, that      infection can cause blindness. This is prevented by putting      either silver nitrate drops or penicillin drops in the      baby's eyes immediately after birth. You should obtain      these drops at the prenatal clinic and always apply them      following a delivery at home.    </p>    <p>      In those instances where the bag of water breaks before      labor pains begin (dry labor) there is increased risk of      fever and infection in both the mother and baby. This is      particularly true if the bag breaks and no labor pains      begin for 24 hours or more <em>(premature rupture of the      membranes).</em> In such cases (estimated to occur in about      1 in 80 hospital deliveries) the mother may develop a fever      and the baby may be born covered with foul-smelling      amniotic fluid. Such a baby must be watched carefully by      experienced persons, since it may develop a      life-threatening infection during the first week of life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHILDBED FEVER AND KIDNEY INFECTIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Both childbed fever and kidney infections can occur in the      mother at any time during the eight days following      delivery.    </p>    <p>      The symptoms of childbed fever are a high temperature,      smelly vaginal discharge and abdominal pain. The condition      is caused by germs getting into the uterus during or after      delivery. Usually these germs are introduced into the      vagina by the person doing the delivery. Always use sterile      gloves (available from a physician's supply house)! Kidney      infections are identified by a high fever and pain on one      side of the mother's back.    </p>    <p>      In general, if significant fever occurs in the postdelivery      period, you have reason to consult an M.D.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER COMPLICATIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Almost all other possible childbirth      coniplications-including blood incompatibility,      anemia, swelling of the feet, blood pressure elevation,      diabetes and syphilis-can be detected by prenatal      check-ups. Some of' the complications I've      mentioned-twins, small pelvic size and abnormal      presentation-are also frequently detected in such      examinations. Additionally, problems such as a bad heart or      bad kidneys in the mother would probably be noted and home      delivery properly discouraged.    </p>    <p>      I'm sold on regular prenatal examinations, in other words .      . . don't wait until the last moment to sign up.    </p>    <p>      In England, where high risk deliveries are handled in      hospitals and normal deliveries are performed either at      home or in the hospital, a 1968 study done in the city of      Wolverhampton produced this interesting comparison: Of      7,133 home deliveries under midwife supervision, there were      54 stillbirths (babies born dead) and no maternal deaths.      Among 12,163 hospital deliveries, there were 369      stillbirths and four maternal deaths.    </p>    <p>      Although it would be unfair to take these figures as      evidence of the greater safety of home      deliveries-since, admittedly, the higher risk      deliveries are shunted to the hospital-they do      indicate that home delivery following adequate prenatal      care and attended by experienced people is not as risky as      our medical profession would have us believe.    </p>    <p>      Suggested reading:    </p>    <p>      COMMONSENSE CHILDBIRTH, by Lester D.
