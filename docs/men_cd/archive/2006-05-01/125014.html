        <p>Since the 1999 appearance of mosquito-borne West Nile virus in North America, it’s more important than ever to keep these pests at bay. You can outsmart mosquitoes with this homemade, Earth-friendly solution.</p><p><strong>Herbal Insect Repellent</strong></p><p>2 1/2 teaspoons total of any combination of the following essential oils: basil, cedarwood, citronella, juniper, lemon, myrrh, palmarosa, pine, rose geranium and/or rosemary (available at health food stores)</p><p>1 cup 190-proof grain alcohol (available in liquor stores)</p><p>Place ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake vigorously. Transfer to small bottles for storage. To use, rub a small amount on any exposed skin (test first to be sure your skin will not be adversely affected by the repellent) or dab it on clothing.</p><p>Experiment a little to find which essential oils work best with your body chemistry. If you’re lucky, you also will like the way they smell; otherwise, add a few drops of peppermint oil to fine-tune the fragrance.</p><p><strong>If you are bitten</strong>, follow this advice from James Duke, Ph.D., author of <em>The Green Pharmacy</em>. Plantain (<em>Plantago</em>, various species) is one of the best herbs to treat bug bites.</p><p>You probably won’t need to plant this home remedy because it is a very common weed, often growing in compacted soil along sidewalks and driveways. To use the plant as first aid for a mosquito bite, crush a few leaves and rub them on the bite. Visit the University of California’s <a href="http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/weeds_intro.html" target="_blank">Weed Photo Gallery</a> for help identifying plantain.</p><p>Some anti-itch drugstore medicines to use include Calamine lotion or cortisone creams. Doctors generally recommend pain relievers, ice packs and meat tenderizer to treat insect bites and stings. Promptly applying a dab of commercial meat tenderizer directly to a sting can neutralize the allergen.</p>
