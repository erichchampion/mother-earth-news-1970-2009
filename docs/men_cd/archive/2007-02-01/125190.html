        Many people with several acres eventually want to raise livestock.To contain animals on a pasture, you will need a good fence. Whatfollows are a few of the best tools that will help you build a goodfence and maintain it over time.<br /><br />- Posthole hand tools. These include a long-handled shovel toloosen and remove soil, a heavy 6-foot pry bar to break up clods ofdirt and to tamp around your post, and a posthole digger, which isessentially two opposing shovels connected by a fulcrum.<br /><br />- Posthole auger. Either powered by a tractor or built-in engine,an auger is a large shaft with spiral grooves that works like agiant drill bit for boring holes into the earth in which to placefence posts.<br /><br />- T-post pounder. T-posts are lightweight metal stakes that arepounded into the ground and hold up fence wire. You can make yourown pounder by using a 4-foot-long, 2-inch-diameter pipe with asolid section of steel rod welded into the top. To use the pounder,slip it over the top of a T-post and bring it down hard over thetop.<br /><br />- Fence pliers. This essential tool helps you manipulate wire. Ifyou're putting up woven or barbed wire that requires staples, get aset of full-feature pliers with cutting notches or edges, a spikefor pulling staples and a hammer for driving them. If you'redealing with high-tensile fence wire, then a simpler pair will dofine. Get a pair with cutting capabilities and large, serrated jawsthat can grip the wire.<br /><br />Whether you have a tiny urban back yard, a sprawling suburban plot,or a small spread in the country, check out The Fence Bible by Jeff Beneke to help you build the perfect fence.<br />
