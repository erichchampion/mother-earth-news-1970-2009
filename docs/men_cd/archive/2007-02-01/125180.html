        Here is a delicious winter treat that is easy to make and has onlytwo ingredients: maple syrup and new snow. My grandma taught me tomake this confection and called it jack wax.<br /><br />Put 1 cup of real maple syrup in a pan and bring to a boil. Turndown the heat and simmer to 235 degrees on a candy thermometer (ifyou don't have a candy thermometer, cook until 'soft ball' stage,which means a spoonful of the syrup dropped into a cup of coldwater forms a soft ball). While the syrup is simmering, take a9-by-13-inch cake pan and fill it with clean snow, packed downwell. When the syrup reaches softball, slowly pour the hot syrup inribbons onto the packed snow.<br /><br />With clean fingers, pick up a section of the caramel-like candy andpop it in your mouth. The combination of the super-sweet maplesyrup and the slightly metallic taste of the cold fresh snow is adelightful winter treat.<br />
