                <p>      <strong>Energy Tips</strong>    </p>        <p>      All-season tips to help you eliminate energy waste in your      home.    </p>        <h3>      Taming the Fridge    </h3>    <p>      <strong>1</strong> You may be spending more than you need      to by running your refrigerator at a cooler setting than is      required. Put an ordinary household thermometer in the      refrigerator for a half hour or so. If it registers colder      than 40°F, change to a warmer setting and check it      again.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2</strong> While you're at it, check the door      gaskets all the way around by closing the door on a dollar      bill. If the bill slips out easily at any place, you're      wasting money. You may be able to correct the problem by      putting paper strips or thin cardboard behind the offending      gasket, or by adjusting the latch. If those don't do the      trick, a new gasket is a good investment and not difficult      to install.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3</strong> That frost-free feature sure is a      convenience, but a standard refrigerator defrosted by hand      a few times a year will use less electricity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4</strong> When the kids grow up and have nests of      their own, that big refrigerator you once needed may become      a liability. A refrigerator operates most efficiently when      it's full, and chances are you don't use its capacity.      Consider giving one of the kids the big box and buying a      smaller model.    </p>        <h3>      Summer's Almost Here...    </h3>    <p>      <strong>5</strong> During the dog days, keep an eye out for      extra lights burning in the house. A typical incandescent      bulb generates 95% of its energy as heat, not light.    </p>    <p>      <strong>6</strong> Don't preheat the oven. In most cases      it's unnecessary, and if it's absolutely necessary don't      preheat for more than 10 minutes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7</strong> Cook with the lids on your pots and      pans. Your food will cook faster and your stove will      produce less heat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8</strong> Use a Crockpot instead of the oven or      range. It uses heat efficiently and costs less. You'll be      amazed at the variety of dishes you can make.    </p>    <p>      <strong>9</strong> Don't use the self-clean feature of your      oven for the whole summer. Cleaning up spills as they      happen is far better than contributing all that heat to the      house.    </p>    <p>      <strong>10</strong> Shower with the window open. Let the      great outdoors have all that humidity.<br />      <br />      <strong>11</strong> A large window fan uses one-fourth as      much energy as an air conditioner. It will go a long way      toward keeping you cool on all but the hottest days. Large      fans are best placed in the attic, where they will push the      hottest air out of the house and draw cooler air from the      downstairs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>12</strong> If operating an conditioner, cleaning      (or replacing, if necessary) the air filter once a month      will reduce the load on the compressor and save money.      Also, place the air conditioner on the shady side of the      house-generally the north side.    </p>    <p>      <strong>13</strong> Be sure to close the outside air      control when operating the air conditioner so that the      compressor is cooling only room air.    </p>    <p>      <strong>14</strong> Setting the conditioner's thermostat to      lower than 78°F is a waste of electricity.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">		<div class="image">      <img src="../images/143-060-01tab.jpg" alt="143-060-01tab.jpg" width="216" height="220" />    </div>    </div>    <h3>      Cold Water for Your Laundry?    </h3>    <p>      <strong>15</strong> Only clothes that are very greasy need      water as warm as 80°F to get clean. Most people hugely      overcompensate by using water as hot as 120°F. Use the      cold setting for ordinary washing, the warm for very dirty      clothes, the hot not at all. Your wash-and-wear clothes      made with synthetic fibers will be just as clean and      considerably less wrinkled if you use cold water for      washing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>16</strong> By the way, don't try to compensate for      extra dirty clothes by adding more detergent to the wash.      It won't make your clothes any cleaner and will hamper the      efficient functioning of the machine. If some clothes need      extra attention, presoak them.    </p>    <h3>      Stretching a Tank of Gas    </h3>        <p>      <strong>17</strong> Replace the air filter. A clogged air      filter leaves your engine gasping for breath and means      you're probably running with a "rich" mixture, that is,      more gas and less air.    </p>    <p>      <strong>18</strong> Change the oil regularly. Dirty oil      will cause more engine friction and reduce efficiency.    </p>    <p>      <strong>19</strong> If your fan belt is too tight, the      engine is working too hard and wasting gas. The belt should      give a little to finger pressure when the engine is off. If      it doesn't, the adjustment is easy to make with a wrench.    </p>    <p>      <strong>20</strong> Badly worn spark plugs can cost you as      much as 2 mi/gal. Change them with every tune-up.    </p>    <p>      <strong>21</strong> You've heard it before but SLOW DOWN! A      car that runs at 40 mi/gal at 40 miles per hour will get as      little as 25 mi/gal at 70. Tailgating is also an      inefficient way to drive your car. You'll be alternatively      breaking and pumping gas as you respond to the forward      driver's perceptions of the road ...not yours. Last and      most important, it's a far less satisfying and far more      dangerous way to drive.    </p>    <p>      <em>Adapted from</em> 547 Tips For Saving Energy In Your      Home <em>(Storey Publishing) by Roger Albright.
