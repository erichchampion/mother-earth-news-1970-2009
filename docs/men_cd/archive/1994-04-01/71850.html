                <p>      <strong>Pet Health</strong>    </p>        <p>      If your dog is becoming destructive or unruly, it may not      just be his disposition.<br />      He may be sick.<br />    </p>	<h5 id="byline">	   By Andrea Looney, D.V.M.	</h5>	        <p>      Human households have condomestic animals for thousands of      years. At present, no less than 61% of U.S. households have      animals, and more than half have more than one animal. The      popular literature has extolled the beneficial consequences      of contact with animals for human health. During the past      decade, television, radio, and the print media have      discussed the value pets have in lowering blood pressure,      providing aging folks with constant companionship,      improving survival after a heart attack, and making people      of all ages feel brighter and less lonely. Various studies      have demonstrated that household pets are perceived to be      family members.    </p>    <p>      Given these facts, it's almost impossible to believe that      in 1990 alone, about 10 million dogs and 8 million cats      were euthanized in animal shelters across the United      States. And think of all the pets that have perished on the      streets without becoming a statistic. Unwanted behavior was      the number one cause for premature death of three-fourths      of these animals. Only 12% of them were euthanized because      of disease or old age. Most dogs and cats become unwanted      and homeless when owners can no longer cope with behavior      problems-behavior that is no longer acceptable to      owners, neighbors, or society.    </p>    <p>      These sad statistics are why behavior management is fast      becoming an extremely important function and responsibility      of veterinarians. As important as it is to vaccinate,      neuter, spay, and manage kidney and heart disease in to      day's pets, it's just as important that veterinarians      consider their responsibility to help clients and their      pets deal with unwanted and unac ceptable behavior. In      fact, veterinary hospitals are often the first place to      seek counseling for behavior problems in pets because of      the importance in ruling out primary or secondary medical      problems that may be the root of the unwanted behavior.    </p>    <p>      Some examples of natural behaviors of dogs and cats that      are often unacceptable to people are chasing, biting,      growling, and other forms of aggression, marking with      urine, pulling at collars, territorial aggression, barking,      jumping, roaming, and digging.    </p>    <p>      The first generality in dealing with truly troublesome      behavior problems is this: Seek veterinary help first! I      can't tell you the number of animals I've seen with medical      problems that actually cause unwanted behaviors. My      favorite example is the family who brings in their ancient      feline companion for euthanasia because "she's been      urinating outside the litter box all week and she's old      anyway." Upon further questioning, it becomes apparent that      the cat actually has a cystitis, or bladder infection,      confirmed by a simple urine analysis, common in older      patients, and treatable with appropriate nutritional      counseling and antibiotic therapy.    </p>    <p>      The second generality is to be patient, especially with      young puppies and kittens, and with the geriatric animals      (these days considered to be any dog or cat over nine years      of age). Raising a puppy or kitten is similar to raising a      small child. Time and perseverance, which in our hectic      daily lives can be hard to come by, are of utmost      importance. Youngsters are not going to learn new behaviors      within a week or two; some may take a month or more.      Repetition is also a key.    </p>    <p>      You, as a parent, must think through all aspects of the      situation that may result in the unwanted behavior, and      then either avoid these or change certain aspects. It may      be helpful to arrange a time to speak to your veterinarian      to devise a program that analyzes and modifies the way you,      the owner, reacts to the behavior. For instance, is it the      older dog who's at fault for chronically jumping on the      couch, or you for moving to another couch and avoiding him      every time he jumps?    </p>    <p>      Physical punishment of any behavior, especially aggressive      behavior, is counterproductive, as it usually leads not      only to fear and bodily harm, but a significant aggressive      response from the pet. Positive reinforcement is not only      conducive to long-term learning, but helps bond the animal      to the owner, relaying a sense of trust and understanding,      instead of intimidation and frustration.    </p>        <p>      Dear Andrea:    </p>    <p>      Our six-year-old German shepherd has become very protective      of his food bowl recently. We have a baby in the house and      are afraid that one day the baby will wander too close to      his bowl and get bitten. Can we train him at this age?    </p>    <p>      Anne Marie Baker<br />      Minneapolis, Minnesota    </p>    <p>      Dear Anne Marie:    </p>    <p>      Food guarding is a common behavioral problem that may be      linked to a syndrome in dogs known as dominance-aggression.      Owners are almost always unaware that control of food is a      critical aspect of the social relations among dogs. For      instance, it is not uncommon to learn that when the dog was      young, it growled anytime it was approached while eating.      The owners believed that the puppy was afraid its food      would be taken away and wanted to reassure it that they      were friendly, so they left it in peace. The consequence      was that the dog learned it simply had to threaten people      to drive them away from food. Dogs with this syndrome      commonly growl at people who approach their favorite      resting area, such as a pillow or couch. Again, family      members may have fostered this behavior by assuming that      the dog should not be disturbed when resting, even if this      meant giving up their own favorite couch.    </p>    <p>      Again, I would suggest first seeking the care and      consultation of a veterinarian to make sure the dog isn't      experiencing pain or having difficulty eating. Tooth      abscesses, fractures, or oral infections may cause      aggression associated with eating. Even eye and ear      problems may initiate an angry response around feeding      time. Many gastrointestinal problems, such as parasites,      food intolerance, or maldigestion may also cause displaced      aggression. Your veterinarian is able to examine your pet      for these things, and could do so via a simple physical      exam.    </p>    <p>      If the patient is an intact male, castration may make the      dog less aggressive, but I think that this is more helpful      in younger animals. It may also be detrimental to stress      the pet with surgery and hospitalization at a time in his      life when he is already confused by the arrival of a new      baby.    </p>    <p>      Because dogs with this syndrome have the potential to      severely injure people, the decision to attempt treatment      must be made carefully. It may be beneficial for you to      separate the child from the dog entirely, which could cause      further separation anxiety, but may be necessary for the      safety of the baby. It's one thing to modify the behavior      of a 5-pound poodle who hoards clothing, but a different      situation completely to deal with a 100-pound shepherd who      may become unmanageably aggressive.    </p>    <p>      Let's examine your behavior around feeding time. Do you      place the food down fearfully and fast? Does the dog take      command of the situation by barking for the meal or begging      and is then rewarded by being fed? Try placing the food      down first and then allowing the dog to enter the room, so      he associates few acts of yours with the actual feeding;      hence, he will have less to focus his aggression on.    </p>    <p>      Some veterinary behavior specialists have advocated      teaching the dog to assume a "down position" to reduce its      dominance and aggressive tendencies. Since any physical      manipulation of an aggressive animal may accentuate its      aggressive tendencies, the dog is taught to eat from a      submissive position (laying on its chest, elbows, and      hocks) by progressive, yet positive, reinforcement. With      the dog sitting, the food is held so that the dog must      lower its head slightly to obtain the reward. The owner      should say "down" and give the food reward when the dog      lowers its head. Over time, the owner requires the dog to      lower itself more and more in order to receive its food.      Eventually the dog must lie down to receive the food. In      such a position, few dogs will feel inclined to become      dominant. The dog should also be required to exhibit this      acceptable, submissive behavior before being fed, let out,      or petted: This will encourage future submissive behavior      and eventually stop the animal from growling near its food.    </p>    <p>      Certain spontaneous growling is initiated by the owner      staring at the pet, standing over its shoulders, or behind      its back while it is being fed. Think of your actions      during the entire feeding regimen and analyze the baby's      presence during the meal. Don't forget to offer the dog      plenty of care and compassion, such as grooming, exercise,      and attention independent of the child at first and then      slowly (and always supervised) with the child. Make sure      the dog knows that even though there's a new baby in the      house, you haven't forgotten who deserves the milk bones!    </p>    <p>      Some great behavior books to help with dog problems are:    </p>    <p>      How To Be Your Dog's Best Friend, (1978, Little, Brown      & Co, Boston, MA) by the Monks of New Skete.<br />      Good Manners for the Modern Dog, (1990, Perfect Paws, San      Francisco, CA) by Gwen Bohnenkamp.    </p>    	    <p>      Dear Andrea:    </p>    <p>      I have a quarter horse that has been suffering from      diarrhea for the last six months. A local horse doctor      suggested giving him wheat bran; an animal magazine      recommended brewer's yeast; and my small-animal vet      suggested yogurt. All of these sugges tions helped, but the      diarrhea inevitably returned. I feed the horse "Target"      feed and timothy hay. Please help.    </p>    <p>      - Walter Nickel<br />      Severn, Maryland    </p>    <p>      Dear Walter:    </p>    <p>      First off, look around and check if the other horses on the      farm are also abnormally thin or suffering from diarrhea.      If so, nutrition and/or parasites may be the problem.      Examine the quality of the feeds. Most horses will maintain      weight without gastrointestinal problems on 4-8 lb/day of a      fresh grain and 8-10 lbs./day of a high-quality grass hay.      Examine your management. Are there any routine farming      changes (time of haying, freezing of water, entry of other      animals into pasture) that might correlate with the onset      of the problem? Winter months are times when problems may      most likely be a true individual medical, versus      management, disease.    </p>    <p>      Feed the horse and observe it eating. If the animal has      difficulty chewing, drops grain, or throws its head while      chewing, your veterinarian may need to check the animal's      teeth for sharp points, which could contribute to      maldigestion and diarrhea. However, chronic diarrhea in the      horse is most commonly attributed to parasites.      Specifically, <em>Stongyles</em> may invade the lining and      arteries of the large and small intestines. Many of these      parasites can also encyst in one area of the large colon,      causing severe malabsorption of water and consequent      diarrhea. Your veterinarian can prescribe a proper rotating      anthelmintic (antiparasitic) program appropriate for your      farm.    </p>    <p>      Some other more serious problems may result in chronic      diarrhea, such as an inflammation of the colon with micro      abscesses (granulomas) or tumor cells (lymphomas). Various      bacteria <em>(Salmonella, Clostridium)</em> are also      capable of causing diarrhea. Impactions of different areas      of the horse's large intestine, particularly the cecum or      fermenting chamber, may result in colic or severe abdominal      pain, and in diarrhea. Your veterinarian can perform a      thorough physical and rectal exam to help determine if any      of these conditions are present. A parasite count or      bacterial culture of the manure can check for infectious      agents.    </p>    <p>      In an older animal, some routine blood chemistry profiles      can be run to check for liver or kidney disease, both of      which can contribute to diarrhea. I would suggest a      thorough exam and a few of these simple, inexpensive tests      before choosing feed additives or arbitrary remedies to      resolve this gastrointestinal problem.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SAD STATISTIC:<br /></strong> In 1990 alone,      approximately 10 million dogs and 8 million cats were      euthanized at animal shelters in the U.S.    </p>        <p>      Dear Andrea:    </p>    <p>      We recently bought a six-month-old Labrador retriever for      our young son to grow with. She's now chewing the house to      shreds, from carpets to curtains to slippers to shoes.      HELP!    </p>    <p>      -Louise Palmer<br />      Binghamton, New York    </p>    <p>      Dear Louise:    </p>    <p>      Chewing is a normal canine behavior. Dogs use their mouths      like we use our hands for grasping food, gaining      information about the environment, relieving boredom, and      reducing tension. Chewing is also an important adaptive      behavior that protects the animal from entrapment. Besides      all this, for puppies at least, it appears to be great fun.      However, chewing becomes an unwanted act in a domestic      environment, especially when a valued object is damaged.    </p>    <p>      There are many reasons why dogs chew. Some are quite      obvious, such as the gingival irritation that motivates a      teething puppy. Your dog should have most if not all of its      permanent teeth in by six months of age, so I would      anticipate that this is not her problem. Certain dogs chew      aggressively because it invites attention from the owner,      like a tug-of-war game. Think about it for a minute: Can we      really expect a puppy to differentiate between a towel used      to tease it into play and curtains fluttering in the      breeze?    </p>    <p>      Anxiety is a leading cause of destructive chewing by adult      dogs. People bite their nails, smoke, and drink. Dogs      vocalize, pace, and chew. In most cases, chewing damage due      to this type of anxiety occurs when the owner is not at      home or is unavailable to the pet.    </p>    <p>      Phobias, such as fear of thunder or other loud noises, can      result in destructive chewing. Doors, window trim, and      walls often become the targets of chewing. Inappropriate      punishment methods, especially delayed or very harsh      punishment, can trigger problems. Delayed feeding can also      result in chewing problems, as the hungry dog explores the      house using its mouth to try to open doors and containers      in search of food. Boredom, lack of stimulation, and social      isolation can also contribute to destructive chewing      behavior.    </p>    <p>      First, rule out any gastrointestinal or teething problems      your pup may have by taking it to your veterinarian. Upper      gastrointestinal (GI) irritations, such as gastritis or      esophagitis may lead to destructive chewing. All too      commonly, young animals are affected by parasitism that may      cause simple GI upset and reflex chewing.    </p>    <p>      It's difficult to pinpoint the cause of chewing in your      pup, but I suspect that it nay be related to age, a high      level of energy, and possibly a need for social interaction      or attention. You may be promoting the chewing behavior by      actions you are not even aware of, such as throwing laundry      on the floor, opening the curtains in front of the dog,      etc. Try to analyze when the dog chews. It maybe helpful to      keep a diary listing occurrences of chewing and relative      information to pinpoint the causes that initiate the      behavior.    </p>    <p>      Direct the dog's chewing toward appropriate objects, such      as specific toys. You can even smear the toys with a piece      of cheese, some peanut butter, or gravy to encourage      chewing of them. The important thing is to never take      proper chewing for granted. Every time the dog's mouth      touches the toy, it should receive praise or reward.    </p>    <p>      At the same time that you promote this desirable chewing,      discourage unacceptable chewing by spreading cayenne      pepper, mixed with a small amount of petroleum jelly, or      oil of citronella, on a piece of wood, a scrap of carpet,      or an old shoe. If the dog has a habit of chewing clothing,      try to put it out of reach on a regular basis. Every day,      try moving the offending items to a new area in the house      (confusion in itself is a deterrent). Hide booby traps      (such as balloons or a stack of beverage cans containing      coins) near the items you'd like to discourage chewing on.      Mousetraps set in an upside-down position are also very      effective. Leave the chew toys readily available during      these processes and place the emphasis on      positive-reinforcement training. Use the chew toys to play      with the pup, teach it to fetch, and always associate their      use with praise and reward.    </p>    <p>      If daytime boredom seems to cause the chewing, try leaving      the radio on during the day, or crate train the animal.      Teaching a puppy to stay crated for progressively longer      periods of time not only teaches it respect for its      environment (the crate) but also may allow you to retain      some of your valuables!    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHEWING AWAY THE BOREDOM<br /></strong> People bite      their nails, smoke and drink when frustrated. Dogs      vocalize, pace and chew.    </p>
