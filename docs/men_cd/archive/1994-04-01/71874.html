            		<p>      <strong>Leaving the Dream</strong>    </p>        <p>      Old habits die hard away from the wilderness.    </p>	<h5 id="byline">	By Deanna Kawatski</h5>		        <p>      In issue #127 [Aug/Sept, 1991], Deanna Kawatski told the      remarkable story of her family's homestead in Northwest      British Columbia. Three miles from the nearest road and one      hundred from the nearest town, she married, had two      children, and lived the life we've only dreamed of. Now she      offers an equally moving sequel, in which she details how      Paradise was lost. . . and found again amid the bustle of      community life.    </p>    	    <p>      For 13 years we had been leading a self-reliant life-style      deep in the Coast Mountains of northern British Columbia,      growing all of our own food and living in almost complete      isolation. Everything suddenly changed the day my husband,      Jay, departed with our kids for a six-week vacation in      Wisconsin. Before he left, he presented me with a letter      that stated, in effect, that our marriage was over.    </p>    <p>      Occupying my time with decision making helped me deal with      my feelings of great loss and hurt. I decided that I would      be the one to leave the bush. So I made plans for the move,      as well as arrangements to pick up the children, Ben and      Natalia, at the airport upon their vacation return.      Unfortunately, the decisive acts couldn't diminish the      grief I felt while moving through my cycle of chores. I fed      the chickens, collected the eggs, tended the giant garden,      gathered clover in the field, and carted it to the rabbits.      In the evening, I sat on the front porch breathing in the      clearing and ebony spruce spires, knowing that I would have      to leave it soon.    </p>    <p>      My mother and sister, Donna, drove 1,000 miles north from      the Shushwap Lake region to retrieve me. Twenty-one boxes      of belongings I felt I couldn't live without were lifted by      helicopter from the Ningunsaw Valley and shipped south to      Chase by transport truck. I also sent along the snowshoes,      skis, and bikes.    </p>    	    <p>      As soon as the three of us entered the prominent northern      town, I felt like a fish out of water. Certainly I had made      trips out of the wilderness, but they averaged once every      three months. Town was Stewart, with a population of 1,800      during boon times and substantially less during the bust      spells. There were no shopping malls, no theaters, no      McDonald's. It was a mere one-bank, one-department-store      town, with a post office the size of an envelope. This new      town had all of the above and more, and when we walked into      a motel located on the highway, I wanted to turn and flee.    </p>    <p>      The next day the three of us happily greeted Ben and      Natalia, fresh off the B.C. Air flight, and drove on to a      motel in Williams Lake. Natalia realized for the first time      that night that our stay away from the Ningunsaw Valley      would be for longer than a couple of weeks, and she began      to cry for her home. She missed the mountains and her      animals. My biggest problem was the noise. Although I wore      earplugs, I couldn't sleep with the racket of trains,      traffic, and sirens.    </p>    <h3>      Making the Transition    </h3>    <p>      Initially we searched for a place to rent in nearby Chase,      and were aghast at the prices. It took more to buy less,      and it was a real shock to go from living on $3,000 to      $5,000 per year to $1,300 per month simply for food and      shelter. In the woods, weeks could pass without having to      handle money, or even think much about it. Suddenly it was      a perpetual concern.    </p>    	    <p>      For the first time, feeding my family became a major      adjustment. In the bush we trudged to the garden, root      cellar, or cupboards for nearly everything, and did, in      fact, produce 75% of our food self-sufficiently. Suddenly      every item had to be purchased. At the supermarket I would      pick up and stare suspiciously at the polished produce,      wondering about its age, its origin, and-for the      purpose of preservation and eye appeal-to what degree      it had been polluted. The amount of choice in this giant      room was astounding, and I found myself practically      paralyzed by indecision. Forty different brands of cereal:      with high fiber and low fat; with low calorie but high      sugar; with just sugar; with sugar, without fat but with      raisins-on and on.    </p>    <p>      Overselection did have one built-in advantage, though. It      hampered my ability to overconsume. And when it came to      purchased products, I ended up applying one rule: Seek out      the cheapest.    </p>        <h3>      In Search of Home    </h3>	    <p>      Due to my deep connection to the north Shushwap      area-I had spent all of my summers here as a      child-we decided to spend the winter here. As soon as      we arrived, I felt like Rip Van Winkle. Shuswap Lake had      been home to my family for five generations, and its      original 160 acres had dwindled down to two acres. It had      also changed from a distinctly pastoral location with      tinkling cowbells and rustling poplar leaves into a busy      tourist haven. Miraculously, amidst the noise and      emissions, the loons, ospreys, and mergansers still swoop      and dive. As we searched for a place to rent, I was more      concerned about the size of the yard and whether it      contained trees than the house itself.    </p>    <p>      We finally settled on one, seven miles from my mother's      property. Little did the owners know that I chose it      because of the several acres of woods just east of it.      Civilization had drastically altered my sense of space. Out      in the wilderness I felt huge but was constantly reminded      of my own insignificance. There were trees that were older,      animals wiser. Back in civilization I felt mentally,      physically, and spiritually crowded.    </p>    <p>      The house that we rented was a furnished two-bedroom      duplex. Ben and I shared a bedroom while Natalia had her      own. The downstairs remained unoccupied. Large windows and      a deck overlooked Shushwap Lake, and the glow of the      fireplace fed our primal spirits and offered us      consolation.    </p>    <p>      And yet how radically different a typical day in the      wilderness had been from a day in civilization. In the      woods our alarm clock was the crow of King, our rooster.      This signaled it was time to begin the first task: starting      a fire in our wood cook stove and simmering the cereal,      often homemade from our own wheat. A brisk trip down the      hill to the outhouse offered a revitalizing (torturous in      winter) tonic of fresh air and view of Natty Creek. The pos      sibility of spying a wolf or moose always lingered. On the      walk back, I would reenter our log home only after grabbing      a hefty armload of birch and spruce for the stove. Then I'd      put the morning meal on the table.</p><p>			Here in our rented house, the propane heat was summoned    at a touch of the thermostat. The initial blast of air    through the vents sent shivers up my spine. Despite my    nagging at breakfast time, the kids rejected the    time-consuming homemade cereal from the bush for a quick bowl    of sugary cereal doused with milk. In the same sense, I was    impressed by the speed of the electric stove. (A couple of    sheets of burned cookies smartened me up on just how fast it    does heat up.) Here in the modern world there was no steep    side hill to negotiate to get to the bathroom, which was warm    and cozy. A fan-which went on simultaneously with the    light-was a surprising indulgence. The efficient flush    of the toilet seemed magical to me-until Ben dropped a    pen down it to see what would happen and plugged the whole    works.    </p>    	    <p>      <strong>MISSING COUNTRY SILENCE</strong><br />      My biggest problem at first was the noise. I couldn't sleep      with the racket of trains, traffic, and sirens.    </p>    	    <p>      Physically I hadn't had it easier in years. Back in the      bush there had always been wood to chop, bread to bake,      rabbits to feed, grain to grind, school to teach, and      floors to sweep. Here I felt out of my element maneuvering      a whining vacuum cleaner across my carpeted living space,      and I often wore earplugs to cope with the racket. Still,      compared to my bush house, which also served as a toolshed,      woodworking shop, school, and food-processing plant, this      one was tremendously easy to keep clean. It was no longer      necessary for me to cook three meals from scratch a day; I      found that, as a family of three, we ate substantially      less.    </p>    <p>      The only wood I had to chop or pack was for the fireplace,      and after 11 years of hand washing, having an automatic      washer and dryer was sheer fun. I noticed on my daily walks      to the post office (this felt like real freedom after      waiting one month to six weeks between trips for mail in      the bush) how each dryer vent from the houses beside the      road exhaled the same smell of fabric softener. In      civilization, everyone's laundry smelled the same. In the      bush, my clothes came off the line permeated with the smell      of wind and rain. The modern convenience I had the most      difficulty adjusting to was the television set, and      eventually I threw it out in favor of expanding our      bookshelf.    </p>    	    <h3>      Home School vs. Public School    </h3>    <p>      For Natalia and Ben, the most radical change was attending      public school after having been home schooled their whole      lives. Suddenly they were forced to ignore their impulses;      their lives became governed by clocks and schedules. In      modern society, children are fitted into the tight harness      of someone else's schedule. Constant diversions and a whirl      of activity quickly become their reality. In the bush, our      lives moved with the cadence of the seasons. I'm left      wondering when people ever have a chance to grow and      cultivate the gardens of creative thought that lead to      invention.    </p>    <p>      On the first morning of school, I walked my children a      half-mile up the road to the bus stop. I felt guilty about      handing them over to the public system. However, I had      given them the choice, and both were eager to make friends.      This wasn't so easy. Ben cried on the first day and      developed a stutter, which has thankfully subsided.    </p>    <p>      To our dismay, Nat's greatest fear materialized. At the      outset she was completely rejected by her classmates.      However, her independent learning proved to be an asset.      She remained conscientious about her work and ended up      winning the academic achievement award, bestowed annually      on one student in the graduating class.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, the North Shushwap Elementary School is a good      one, and a caring staff encourages parental participation.      Last year I helped with various activities, including the      cross-country ski club. And Natalia had the chance to learn      to play the clarinet. Eventually, she was accepted by the      class, but it was mainly the required conformity above all      else. Quietly, I watched the changes. In the bush      practicality and comfort ruled and the kids were content to      wear cast-off clothing. Now brand names infiltrate their      psyches, and the frequent requests for fancy items puts a      strain on my brain and budget. Other strains included      viruses. Within a few weeks both kids-who almost      never got sick-were on antibiotics.    </p>    <h3>      Changing Habits, Not Values    </h3>    <p>      Despite the changes, I have found that old habits die hard.      Regularly I refer to the bathroom as the outhouse, and to      the compost bucket as the chicken bucket. One night I woke      up to what I thought was the glacier-fed wind whistling      down the valley, carrying with it the scent of wolf packs.      I opened my eyes and realized that it was a noisy truck on      the road below our rented abode. After years of living in      the bush down a rough foot trail three miles from anything      resembling a road, I resented the intrusion. And through my      window, from across the street, shone my neighbor's light.      Being from the city she didn't feel safe sleeping without      it. At night I craved genuine darkness.    </p>    <p>      Despite, or perhaps because of, my longing for the      Ningunsaw Valley, I would snowshoe regularly through the      woods and across the nearby golf course, seeking out the      deer beds. Still I found a new strength unfurling.    </p>    <p>      Moving to civilization gave me a chance to learn how much I      could do on my own. In addition to working through the      transition of households, I replaced the flat tires of      Ben's bike, assembled a bookshelf, and fixed Natalia's door      when she got locked out of her bedroom. I paid the bills      and managed our affairs, and even though I didn't know how      we were going to survive financially, I learned that I      could be organized and efficient.    </p>    <p>      This past spring I started a small garden on my mother's      property. It was virgin sod, which I turned by hand, not      far from the spine of rock that my great grandmother had      piled when she pioneered here in the early 1900s. With      growing enthusiasm I planned the layout, and later      harvested small but healthy crops of peas, potatoes, beets,      tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, and other delectables.      The climate here is much more hospitable than in the north,      where frost could occur at any time of year. And no longer      are huckleberries our main winter fruit. Here the apple,      plum, and pear trees flourish.    </p>    <p>      I see the concept of self-sufficiency in a slightly      different light now. Our fiercely individualistic North      American society has created a lot of lonely people. As      much as we must learn independence, we must also learn      interdependence. In the bush there was too much work for      two people, and Jay and I both ended up feeling      unappreciated by the other. I no longer see it as possible,      or even desirable, to do everything on one's      own-individually or as a family. We must work      together. Still I continue to bake my own bread and to cook      from scratch. I preserve produce for the winter, walk or      bike when I can, and try to conserve more than consume.    </p>    <p>      One afternoon last spring, as I rode my bike home from the      garden, I was chased by massive thunderheads. A fierce wind      whipped branches across the road and churned the lake to a      chartreuse mood reminiscent of summers past. Then the      clouds released themselves in torrents of rain, which      bounced off the fading road. In a flash I remembered that      in nature, as well as in life, there is always room for the      unexpected, and jubilantly I felt myself free and eager to      venture on.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE DOWNSIDE OF INDEPENDENCE</strong><br />      In the bush there was just too much work, and Jay and I      both ended up feeling unappreciated.    </p>
