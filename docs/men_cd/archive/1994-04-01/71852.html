                <p>      <strong>Seasons</strong>    </p>    			<p>	      For skywatchers, April and May are going to be      blockbusters.		</p>		<h5 id="byline">      By Fred Schaff    </h5>        <p>      If you're looking for that wonderful thing called variety,      you certainly can find it in nature. And especially in      spring. Among our topics in this column for April and May      are tornadoes, spring peepers, eclipses, and May      Day-the holiday that leads off the month of flowers.    </p>    <h3>      Of May and May Day    </h3>    <p>      After April, the ficklest month, comes sweet May. Weather      historian David Ludlum has suggested that this lovely month      should have been named Flora, after the Roman goddess of      flowers, rather than May, after Maia, another Roman goddess      of spring and fertility (actually Maia was originally a      Greek goddess).    </p>    <p>      The halfway point of spring falls on May 6, though in the      northern United States and southern Canada, frosts and      chilly weather are not uncommon early in the month. So it      is not fair to say that the entire month is abloom      everywhere. Memorial Day was put at the end of May to make      sure that even in the northernmost United States there      would be plenty of flowers to lay on graves of fallen      soldiers.    </p>    <p>      As usual, it is not quite at the mathematically accurate      halfway point of a season that the "cross-quarter day" gets      celebrated. In spring, the cross-quarter holiday is May      Day, the first of May, a day of merriment and many innocent      and sweet traditions. Some are now little remembered: for      instance, the custom of having maidens wash their face with      May dew gathered at dawn on May Day to assure beauty.    </p>    <p>      The dance around the Maypole and the selection of a May      Queen are traditions of old England that even flourished in      parts of the United States until early this century.      Another delightful tradition that has survived to the      present (in my wife's family, for one!) is the custom of      children rising early to gather wildflowers and secretly      leaving them on the doorstep of a friend, neighbor, or      mother. They knock, run, hide, and watch!    </p>    <p>      Of course, long ago, the first of May was also the occasion      for the dark revelries and human sacrifices of the Celtic      holiday Beltane, fire of the god Bel. This occurred halfway      through the Druidic year that began on Samhain, the      predecessor of Halloween. Whereas Samhain marked the      beginning of the year at its low point in the cycle of the      living world, Beltane marked the middle of the year when      growth was at its strongest.    </p>    <p>      Diagrams for dusk and dawn show scenes about 45 minutes      after sunset or before sunrise, as viewed from 40Â°      north latitude (approximately correct for the U.S. and      southern Canada).<br />      -Adapted from Sky Calendar, Abrams Planetarium, Michigan      State University, East Lansing, MI 98824.    </p>    <h3>      Tornado Safety    </h3>    <p>      Although May can bring us some of our most pleasant days,      it is also prime time in many parts of the Midwest for the      most violent of all atmospheric phenomena-the      tornado.    </p>    <p>      Tornado funnels range from tens of yards to about a mile      across. They may pass in a matter of seconds at forward      speeds of seldom more than 40 or 50 mph. But it is the      tremendous upward suction and especially the rotational      speeds of up to 300 mph that can be deadly.    </p>    <p>      There is much to say about these awesome storms, but I want      to focus here on safety. Many homes in tornado-prone parts      of the country have special storm shelters      underground-and that is the place to be when a      tornado is heading your way. Mobile homes are crumpled by      even small tornadoes. There's an important tornado safety      precaution given in older books that needs to be corrected:      The southwest corner is <em>not</em> the safest place in      the house to be when a tornado, moving southwest to      northeast-as they most often do-hits the house.      The best advice is to put as many sturdy interior walls as      possible between you and the tornado and get down,      preferably underneath something that will protect you from      falling debris.    </p>    <p>      Good news is that the NEXRAD system of Doppler radar is in      the process of being installed around the United States.      These radar systems have already made it possible to give      people many more minutes' worth of warning that a tornado      is about to descend from the clouds.    </p>    <h3>      Observe the Big Solar      Eclipse-Safely!    </h3>    <p>      April and May are particularly interesting months in      astronomy this year, with April's conjunctions of moon and      planet (see Almanac timetable and Sky Calendar diagrams)      and May's two eclipses.    </p>    <p>      The lunar eclipse on the night of May 24 is a small partial      one; the moon goes only one-quarter of the way into the      umbra, or central shadow of the Earth. The slight staining      you'll see on the lower edge of the moon before it enters      the umbra is caused by the penumbra, or outer shadow, of      Earth. Even such a small eclipse is fascinating to watch.      If you have a telescope, see if there is, at any stage,      color to part of the umbra or its edge.    </p>    <p>      The really exciting eclipse of May is an America-wide solar      eclipse, the deepest visible for the 48 states as a whole      until several decades from now. You MUST NOT look at the      sun during this eclipse without proper eye protection, but      I'll discuss in a moment what kind of protection and      observing techniques are safe.    </p>    <p>      First, let's consider what kind of eclipse this will be.      For most of the country, the eclipse will be a large      partial one; most of the sun will be hidden. If you live in      Alaska, you'll see a small partial solar eclipse, but in      Hawaii none at all. A wide diagonal strip of land from the      Southwest to southern Maine will be treated to more than      just an ordinary partial eclipse; it will be treated to an      annular solar eclipse.    </p>    <p>      Annular means "ring-shaped." In such an eclipse the moon      passes centrally in front of the sun but is out too far in      its orbit to appear large enough to hide the sun's entire      disk. A ring of sunlight shines out from around the moon's      silhouetted form. When the moon is close enough to earth      during a central eclipse, the eclipse is total-all      the sun's fiery disk is hidden and magnificent sights like      the sun's pearly outer atmosphere appear in a sky dark      enough for some stars to come out. At an annular eclipse      you don't get to see grandeur as stunning as that of a      total eclipse. But you do get to see a rather impressive      darkening of sky and landscape, change in the color of      sunlight, weird shadows on the ground, and more.    </p>    <p>      But what about getting a sight of the sun's disk itself      during the eclipse? During a partial or annular eclipse,      you should <em>never</em> look at the sun unless you use      proper protection for your eyes. You can look through      shade, such as a suitably large piece of welder's glass      that can be bought for about $2 or less from your local      welding supply store, but only with the eyes, not with      binoculars or telescope. Many small telescopes come with      solar filters, but often they are poorly made. Seek out      your local planetarium or astronomy club for safe      telescopic views, unless you want to use a perf ectly safe      alternative and try projection with your telescope or      binoculars.    </p>    <p>      All you do in projection is put the sun at your back and      then-being careful not to ever look into the      telescope or binoculars-maneuver your optical      instrument until its tube (or tubes) is casting the      smallest possible shadow. The sun should now be shining      into your instrument and the magnified solar image can be      projected onto a screen-say, a piece of cardboard. But be      careful, the eyepiece of a telescope can focus great heat      in front of it. On your screen you will see a disk of light      (focus the optical instrument or adjust the screen's      distance to make that disk sharp-edged), possibly with some      curious black speckles here and there on it. What you see      is the sun, with various dark looking sunspots.    </p>    <p>      By the way, even if you have no binoculars or telescope,      you can project the image of the solar eclipse with      something as simple as a piece of cardboard with a pinhole      in it. The image projected onto a second piece of cardboard      will be tiny, but you should be able to see an ever-larger      bite taken out of it as the moon moves across the sun.    </p>             <h3>      Spring Peepers    </h3>    <p>      Before birds ever sang, there were Earth's first singers:      the frogs. One of the most familiar choruses is the      high-pitched, long-carrying keening of the variety of tree      frogs known as Spring peepers.    </p>    <p>      Similar frogs are the West Coast's pacific tree frog, the      Southwest's color-changing canyon tree frog, and the      South's green tree frog, squirrel tree frog, pine tree      frog, and whistling tree frog. But almost the entire      eastern half of the country is home to the common tree frog      and the spring peeper.    </p>    <p>      Spring peepers are very small (about 3/4 to 1 1/2" long)      and distinguished from other frogs by the roughly X-shaped      dark markings on their backs. These tiny creatures use pads      on fingers and toes to cling to branches.    </p>    <p>      Actually, spring peepers begin their song before April and      May. They are noted as one of the first voices and      harbingers of spring. They can endure considerable cold. A      few hours before dawn on April 20, 1983, here in southern      New Jersey, I was out in a rare late snow-an inch or      more was on the ground-when I heard the strong song      of spring peepers. The temperature was 31Â° F.    </p>    <h3>      Lunar Eclipse Timetable		</h3>		<p>	      (in Eastern Daylight Time)    </p>    <p>      For Partial Lunar Eclipse of May 24-25    </p>    <p>      10 P.M. EDT (May 24): First traces of penumbral shading      visible around now?<br />      10:37 P.M. EDT: Umbra first touches moon (before sunset and      moonrise on West Coast).<br />      11:30 P.M.

PDT      for California to almost 2 P.M. EDT for Maine. Check May      issue of Sky & Telescope magazine for more information.      Or, if you have a very serious interest, request a booklet      of full data about the eclipse from: Jay Anderson, Prairie      Weather Centre, 900-266 Graham Ave,, Winnipeg, MB, Canada      R3C 3V4.    </p>    <p>      Some of the cities the eclipse will appear annular from      (the Sun covering up to 93% of the sun's diameter): El      Paso, Amarillo, St. Louis, Springfield (Illinois), Detroit,      Toledo, Buffalo, Toronto. The cities of Kansas City and      Chicago are just outside the zone of annular eclipse.    </p>    <h3>      Almanac for April and May 1994    </h3>    <p>      <strong>April</strong>    </p>    <p>      1.
