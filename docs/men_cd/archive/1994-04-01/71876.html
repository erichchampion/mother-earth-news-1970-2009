                <p>      <strong>Garden and Yard</strong>    </p>    			<p>      <strong>MOTHER brings you the best seeds of the new growing      season.</strong>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">      By John Vivian.    </h5>        <p>      Time proven garden seed varieties such as Provider bush      beans, Green Mountain potatoes, and Cut-&-Come Again      zinnias predominate in our gardens. But we always leave a      few rows to experiment with, like the year purple      vegetables were all the rage and we grew purple potatoes,      purple bush beans, purple-ker neled corn, and purple-head      broccoli. They go along with the eggplant, blue kale, and      those Arancuna chicken eggs that were supposed to be      low-cholesterol and blue shelled but turned out to be few,      tiny, and olive drab.    </p>    <p>      This year, we're trying traditional Golden Bantam sweet      corn again and will strive to get it picked before it turns      too chewy for anything but corn relish. We usually      transplant especially vigorous volunteer tomatoes or squash      plants from the compost bins to the trial garden, and we      always try a few of the new varieties that look so      dew-bedecked and mouth watering in the seed catalogs.    </p>    <p>      Of course, not every experiment succeeds in our ornery      Yankee climate. Only Royalty "Purple-Pod" Bush Beans remain      from the "purple" experiment, and most volunteer plants      prove to be all vine and no fruit. But only by      experimenting did we discover fast-growing top-quality      Green Comet broccoli and the great tomato Celebrity that      have become staples of our summer's bounty. And we only      heard of them because they were recommended in years past      by All-America Selections (AAS).    </p>    <p>      All-America Selections was founded in 1933 by North      American seed growers to establish a degree of uniformity      in home garden seed identification and promotion-voluntary      "truth in labeling" 60 years before other industries had it      forced on them. Each year, AAS enlists a panel of unpaid,      volunteer experts-academics, horticulturists,      gardeners, and seed growers from 50-plus locations across      the United States and Canada-to try the new garden      vegetables and new cut- and bedding-flower varieties      submitted by member organizations.    </p>    <p>      In blind trials, where identity of seed developers is      concealed, each panelist germinates upwards of 1,000 trial      plants, grows them to maturity, then evaluates each on the      basis of growth habit, disease resistance, yield, and      appearance-and, for eating quality in vegetables.      All-America Selections collects and tabulates the findings      and superior varieties are determined. Periodically, medals      are awarded for truly exceptional quality or originality:      the last gold-medal winner was fast-flowering coreopsis      "Early Sunrise" in 1989. Winners are used to promote the      seed industry. Of course, not all the selected varieties      become popular, but those that do will sport the "AAS      Winner" or "AAS Gold Medal Winner" designation in their      catalog descriptions and you will see AAS on seed packets.    </p>    <p>      Time was, we home gardeners couldn't avoid      Sunday-supplement and magazine articles on the new      All-America Selections each late winter/early spring. But      these days the garden press seems to be neglecting AAS in      favor of their own panels of experts ...following what one      of our seasoned contributors calls "The Emma Mudd School of      Gardening"; the idea being that the personal experience of      a few amateur gardeners is more valid than the informed      judgment of USDA and aggie school professionals. A shame to      waste all that brainpower whose sole purpose is to make      things easier for the rest of us.    </p>    <p>      Because we can't help but feel that the recommendations of      a score of horticulture pros is at least as credible as the      opinions of Emma Mudd, here are the AAS for the 1994      growing season. Each new seed variety-especially if a      hand-pollinated hybrid-has taken its developer many      years and a considerable investment to produce. Prices will      be higher than for older varieties but should be uniform      between sellers unless you patronize the growing number of      seed folks selling "minipacks" containing a few seeds at a      big price break.    </p>    <p>      But, as the packet will tell you, all the seed is freshly      packed for this year, yearning to sprout and awaiting only      your green thumb. So, go down to the seed displays at your      local nursery or get out your mail-order catalogs and order      some of the All-America Selections. If a new variety      performs exceptionally well for you in speed and      reliability of germination, hardiness, and disease      resistance, drought or wet tolerance, or especially in      ornamental or eating quality-let MOTHER know? If enough      readers feel they've discovered another Green Comet or      Celebrity, we'll pass the word.		</p>	<h3>	      AAS WINNERS 1990-1994		</h3>			<p>	      <strong>1994 AAS Flower Award Winner<br /></strong>      <strong>Lavender "Lady" English Lavender</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is the old-fashioned aromatic herb with sweet-scented,      lavender flowers that your grandmother dried and sewed into      little sachet pillows to keep in her underwear drawer. In      grandmother's day, it was a low perennial that was      "blind"-nonflowering the first year after planting from      seed. It is not frost hardy either, so could be grown as a      perennial only to zone five.    </p>    <p>      "Lady" is the first lavender that can be grown as an      annual. It will bloom the first year-if planted      inside four to six months before setting out. "Lady" grows      to two feet in height and is covered with bloom.    </p>        <p>      <strong>1994 AAS Vegetable Award Winner<br />      Tomato F1 "Big Beef"</strong>    </p>    <p>      A greatly improved beefsteak-type giant tomato. The      original "one slice fills a sandwich" tomato was pink,      grainy, and bland. "Big Beef" was cited by judges as      "meaty, not mealy," having "firm flesh with a sweet flavor"      and a "good sugar-to-acid ratio." Fruits as early as 73      days from setting out-extremely early for such large      fruit. Multiple tolerance to disease, which means less      stress, which means wider adaptation and greater      production. A rank-growing indeterminate plant, so should      be staked, pruned, or grown in a wire cage. Will flower all      summer and leave plenty of green fruit at frost. Don't grow      for canning, as it is liable to be too subacid in most      soils.    </p>        <p>      <strong>1994 AAS Vegetable Award Winner<br />      Cucumber F1 "Fanfare"</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here is a cucumber that produces high-quality, 8 to 9 inch,      smooth-skinned, slicing-type fruit on plants that only need      two feet of space. "Monoecious," with both male and female      flowers on each plant, so no separate pollinator plants are      needed. Good for patio containers as well as small-garden      culture. High yields of less-bitter fruit, and experiences      less stress due to its multiple disease tolerance. Begins      producing just 63 days from planting seeds into warm soil.    </p>    <h3>      RECENT AAS WINNERS    </h3>    <p>      <strong>1993<br />      Pumpkin "Baby Bear"<br /></strong> A 1 1/2- to 2 1/2-pound      pumpkin in a perfect jack-o'-lantern shape. Both the flesh      and hulless seeds make good eating. Stores well, too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>T</strong> <strong>omato F1 "Husky      Gold"<br /></strong> How about a tomato of pure gold?      Semi-determinate; if grown unpruned in a cage, produces 7-      to 8-ounce fruit all summer. Produces after 70 days.    </p>    <p>      <strong>1992<br /></strong> <strong>Carrot      "Thumbelina"<br /></strong> A good-quality miniature      carrot. Two inches long and good for container or garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dill "Fernleaf"<br /></strong> A dill that only      reaches 18 to 24 inches in height, and won't "lodge" or      fall over when ripe with seed heads. All of the plant but      the root can be used in cooking and making pickles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>1991</strong> <strong><br />      Pole Bean "Kentucky Blue"<br /></strong> Not a hybrid, but      a genetically engineered combination of old favorites Blue      Lake and Kentucky Wonder. Grow 7foot-tall vines on long      poles for high production of a fine-flavored green bean.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Squash F1 "Tivoli"<br /></strong> A vegetable      squash from a bush rather than a rangy vine that wants to      take over the garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Watermelon F1</strong> <strong>"Golden      Crown"</strong> <strong><br /></strong> Gold rind, red      flesh in fruit of "icebox size" of 6 to 8 pounds, about two      months from seed.<br />      <br />      <strong>1990</strong><br />      <strong>Bean "Derby"<br /></strong> A bush bean maturing in      only 57 days. Higher yield, better quality, more tender.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pepper F1 "Super</strong> <strong>Cayenne"</strong>      <strong><br /></strong> If you like hot peppers, you'll      love this decorative, 24-inch-tall plant with improved      yield.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Squash F1 "Cream of the Crop"</strong><br />      A bush acorn plant producing creamy white, 2-pound to      3-pound, hard-shelled, "winter-keeping" type fruit on bushy      plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Squash F1 "Sun Drops"<br /></strong> An oval,      golden-yellow summer squash harvestable from "baby" sized      to 4 inches in diameter.    </p>        <h3>      Deciphering Seed Packets and Catalogs    </h3>    <p>      Like all technical specialties, seed growers/sellers have a      shorthand to convey the most information in the least      space. Aside from a paragraph or two describing the variety      and its growth habit may be cryptic codes and terms that      may leave you in the dark. The following is a seed-packet      lingo legend:    </p>    <p>      <em>Stock Numbers</em> come out of the order-taker's      computer and are crucial; get one wrong on mail-order form      and you can end up with a packet of Heliocanthus when you      expected Head Lettuce.    </p>    <p>      <em>Varietal Names,</em> especially the older ones, can      vary among suppliers and their section of the country. The      low evergreen ground cover with small blue flowers called      periwinkle in one locale is Vinca Minor or "vinca" in      another Ground-Myrtle or "myrtle" elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      With new varieties, it's best to buy from the firm that      tells you on the packet or in catalog copy that they      developed or import the seeds. They will use the correct      name and reserve the best seed if there is a quality      choice.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hybrid</em> <em>plants</em> (Hb) F1 or F2 are bred from      two or more different parent stocks, with traits that      improve on the best characteristics of both strains, but      they are unable to pass them on-like a mule can't      heir its kick.    </p>    <p>      Don't save hybrid seed and plant it; you'll get an      atavistic throwback with the worst characteristics of some      half-wild great-grandparent. Open-pollinated (OP) seed will      grow true to type. Reserve seed <em>Reselected</em> variety      that does best in your soil and climate. Genetics of sweet      corn is often indicated by an (S), which means it is a      glucose-containing, eating variety rather than field corn.      (Se) is an extra-sweet hybrid; (Sh2) is a super-sweet      hybrid that must self-pollinate ...must be planted upwind      of and some distance from other corn varieties to develop      the sugary trait.    </p>    <p>      <em>Maturity</em> means days to harvest not to fully ripe,      seed stage maturity, except for tomatoes and peppers that      you leave on the vine long enough to turn red. It indicates      time to harvest from average day of planting seed (or      transplanting indoor-started seedlings) into what the      seedsman sees to be a typical home garden. Some seed is      simply rated as early/midseason/late. But look hard at the      maturities; often "Early" varies only by a day or two from      "midseason" or "main-crop" The figures are approximations      at best, so use them for comparison only; an 82-day tomato      has already spent weeks in the indoor flat, and it may      never ripen at all if you live in a short season area and      plant it out late.    </p>    <p>      <em>Disease & Pest Resistance</em> shows what degree of      tolerance to common pests or diseases have been bred into      the seed. <em>Verticillium</em> and <em>Fusariurn</em> live      inmost garden soil; so do nematodes of many kinds. Yellows      and nematodes are worst in southern soil. Bred-in      resistance is the best preventative.    </p>    <p>      AM means a past All-America Selection. VFN is commonly run      together; it means a resistance to: <em>Verticillium</em>      wilt of tomatoes and eggplant. Fusarium fungus of tomatoes      and others. Nematodes, microscopic soil worms that bother      especially tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant. T or TMV      indicates resistance to tobacco mosaic virus that affects      tomatoes and peppers. Y means a resistance to Yellows, a      common fungus affecting members of the cabbage family. A      indicates resistance to anthracnose in beans and cucumbers      or altenaria stem fungus in tomatoes. BMV means resistance      to bean mosaic virus. CMV means resistance to cucumber      mosaic virus. MTO is seed free of lettuce mosaic virus.    </p>    <p>      <em>Proprietary</em> <em>Codes</em> in a variety of      configurations indicate a variety's special suitability for      new gardeners, for especially hot and dry or cool and wet      climates, or for other growing situations.    </p>
