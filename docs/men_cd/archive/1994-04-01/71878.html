                <p>      <strong>The Last Laugh</strong>    </p>    		<p>	      <strong>Thoughts on getting lost and giving directions...</strong>		</p>			<h5 id="byline">      By Jeff Taylor    </h5>        <p>      Soon as the rosy-fingered dawn appears, joy and I grab long      handed tools to toil in the soil and comb the loam. A      hummingbird twinkles down a curving flight path to the end      of my shovel, looks me in the eye and whirs away like a      tiny electric motor. All is peaceful for an hour or so. But      then our dogs bark madly in the dooryard when a white      dinosaur lumbers up the driveway, its well-muffled engine      rising up like a submarine breaching water, and then it      slams down, engine idling.    </p>    <p>      We get a few lost tourists every spring. Considering how      many vehicles are represented, this one counts for a whole      season: one motor home, with two motorcycles mounted on the      rear bumper, towing a powerboat. From behind a windshield      the size of a picture window, two harried faces stare down.      As campers go, these two do not look happy; something has      disgruntled them. It's a good bet they are having a marital      fight, postponed while they stop for directions. She points      at me and her mouth moves: "Ask him, Walter."    </p>    <p>      Country people take their entertainment where they can get      it. Even so, rural Oregonians try to be helpful. Strangers      and outlanders, know this: It is a myth that Oregonian      country people are not friendly to tourists, especially      those from the neighboring state to the south. Anyone who      leaves tectonically unstable regions to seek high ground      and bedrock is using pure intellect. But privacy is the      sweetest and rarest commodity in the country, and houses      aren't built near roads solely for motorists who cannot      read maps.    </p>    <p>      <em>The man leans out his window while his wife continues      to micromanage him. "I'm lost," he admits, flapping a      shut-up gesture over his shoulder at her. "Which way is the      ocean?"</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I pitch my lower lip between thumb and forefinger. It's      a mo mentous question. Even the dogs look at me      expectantly. In 11 years at this location giving directions      to lost tourists, that's the dumbest thing I've ever been      asked. We ought to have some kind of commemorative      celebration for it, perhaps a little award ceremony. But      when differing lifestyles intersect, we should all exercise      patience and charity.</em>    </p>    <p>      So I point down our driveway. "Okay, if you get back on      that highway..." I begin. Obviously this fellow has no      mystical connection with the mother ocean that spawned his      first cellular ancestor. Every drop of fluid in his body      has the same salinity as the Pacific Ocean-the largest body      of water on the planet and the one he can't locate. You can      smell it from here, when the wind is right. This highway      leads directly to the coast and directly away from it. Far      to the east is the Atlantic, another entire ocean. Ergo,      there can be no wrong way if they just keep going.    </p>    <p>      Should I tell him all this, answering the larger and more      germane philosophical issues, or would he consider it rude?      So many answers, all of them true. Meantime, I supply      simple, easy directions: "...and then you turn left, which      is west ...." Why do they want to go to the ocean? Nothing      there but ozone, as Bernard Shaw observed, to give one      fearful <em>appetitre</em> and prolong one's life unduly.    </p>    <p>      "Was I right? What does he say?" she asks him, obviously      unhappy with the speed of my reply. Joy drifts over from      the garden, looking sensible; so the woman opens the window      on her side and speaks to my wife, probably asking her the      same question. It may be a mistake. Joy is the very      incarnation of hospitality and an expert in the art of      country harmony, but a transplanted Vermonter to the core.      When asked directions, Vermonters give monosyllabic      responses with zero information value: another old myth,      but it happens to be true.    </p>    <p>      I point, dramatically, in the direction of the Pacific:      "...And then you keep going until you see something big,      blue, and wet. That's it." He nods curtly and turns around,      quite a feat with a rig that size. He misses our shed and      drives over the hump without bending his drive shaft too      badly.    </p>    <p>      Joy looks at me. We walk to the bluff, watching them go.      The motor home stops at the front of the drive, hesitates,      and turns in the correct direction. They will reach the sea      in one hour. Godspeed.    </p>
