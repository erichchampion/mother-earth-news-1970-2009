                <p>      <strong>Natural Kitchen</strong>    </p>    <p>      Mother's Kitchen    </p>    			<p>      From potato salad to frittatas, those delicious green      stalks can help make some of the spring's best      recipes.		</p>			<h5 id="byline">      By Anne Vassal    </h5>        <p>      Asparagus is one of those strange vegetables-you      either love it or you hate it. Perhaps you have that all      too common childhood memory of stringy, limp stalks that      were so overcooked that they forced you to shun the green      stuff ever since. When I was little, my large family didn't      have the opportunity to experience asparagus; it was too      expensive. And when we did, it was often the      gastronomically challenging variety mentioned above. A      special treat then, was visiting my grandparents' house      during asparagus season, knowing that I was sure to dine on      what I thought was a rare, exotic, and slightly scary      vegetable.    </p>    <p>      My grandmother had an asparagus patch behind her garage not      too far from her prize winning flower garden. She was a      proper grandmother who wore a dress every day of her life,      even if she never left the house. That's why it was      intriguing to me to see her don old pleated pants to work      in the garden. She must have looked like Jean Harlow      wearing those pants during the 1930s. That's one of my best      memories of my grandmother: gray-haired and garden-gloved,      kneeling next to me in the asparagus patch while we scouted      the perfect stalls. We'd then lunch on steamed asparagus      with plenty of butter (butter wasn't evil back then),      cucumber sandwiches, and homemade ginger cookies.    </p>    <p>      <em>Buying Asparagus:</em> The best asparagus is available      sometime in February up until the end of June, with April      and May peak months in the Midwest. It's best to buy      asparagus only when it's in season and extremely fresh. It      must be refrigerated or stored standing in an inch or so of      water in the supermarket immediately after harvesting to      maintain its flavor and nutrients. The vitamins C, E, and A      found in asparagus will diminish rapidly at room      temperature. Also, it will lose some of its residual      sugars, which impart flavor, and the stalks will lose      moisture, making them tough and stringy.    </p>    <p>      Look for firm stalks without ridges (a sign that the      asparagus is ancient). The tips should be bright green,      tightly closed, not wilted or gone to seed. The diameter of      the stalks is not directly related to quality or      tenderness, but stalks that measure about 1/2" in diameter      are usually preferable.    </p>    <p>      <em>Varieties:</em> American asparagus is green while      European asparagus is purple-streaked or the prized white      asparagus. The white variety is planted underground to      prevent the development of chlorophyll, which turns it      green. This process yields more fibrous and stronger      tasting spears but is more expensive and less nutritious.    </p>    <p>      <em>Storage:</em> If store bought, cut a little off the      ends and refrigerate standing in an inch of water in a deep      container. Cover loosely with a plastic bag that doesn't      touch the tips. Take care not to store in the back of the      refrigerator where the tips will often freeze. Depending      largely on its freshness when purchased, the asparagus      should keep 3-5 days.    </p>    <p>      <em>Preparation:</em> Break off the tough bottoms of the      stalks at the point at which they break off naturally.      Rinse briefly in cold water. Whatever cooking method you      choose, cook quickly until tender but still bright green      and slightly crisp. Add the skinny stalks last so they      won't overcook.    </p>    <p>      <em>Steaming:</em> Use a vegetable steamer or a minimal      amount of simmering water to steam the asparagus in a      covered pan for 35 minutes, depending on the thickness. If      using for a salad, dunk immediately in cold water for a      second to stop the cooking, then refrigerate.    </p>    <p>      <em>Microwaving:</em> Arrange the spears in a covered pan      with all the tips pointing toward the center of the pan.      Add 1 tablespoon of water or butter. Microwave 2 minutes,      rotate the pan and turn over the stalks, and microwave up      to about 2 more minutes. This is not my favorite method of      cooking asparagus because it sometimes doesn't cook      uniformly.    </p>    <p>      <em>Roasting:</em> Place the asparagus on a baking or      cookie sheet and drizzle lightly with olive oil, seasoning,      or herbs. Roast uncovered in a 450°F oven for about 4-5      minutes, turning them over once.    </p>    <h3>      Asparagus-Potato Salad    </h3>    <p>      <em>6 small red or white, skinned potatoes, halved and cut      into 1" pieces</em> <em><br /></em> <em>1 small red pepper,      thinly sliced<br />      1/2 red onion, finely chopped<br />      1/2 pound asparagus, tough bottoms removed, and cut on      diagonal into 1 " pieces<br />      1/2 cup parsley or chives (or a combination of both),      chopped</em>    </p>    <p>      In a covered saucepan, using a vegetable steamer (or using      a small amount of simmering water), steam the potatoes      until a fork can be inserted-about 15 minutes. Remove      and place potatoes in a bowl with the red pepper and onion,      then toss. Steam the asparagus the same way for a few      minutes just until tender. Rinse immediately under colder      water briefly to stop them from cooking further. Toss into      the salad with the parsley and enough vinaigrette (recipe      follows) to coat the vegetables. Chill or serve at room      temperature.    </p>        <h3>      Asparagus Vinaigrette    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 large clove garlic, peeled and smashed<br /></em>      <em>2 small shallots, peeled (optional)<br />      1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br />      2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar<br />      2 tablespoons olive oil<br />      1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind<br />      1/4 cup lemon juice<br />      1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      1 tablespoon fresh dill weed (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix well in blender.    </p>    <h3>      Smoked Tomato Sauce    </h3>    <p>      Try using this low-fat sauce instead of hollandaise sauce      to serve over hot asparagus. This dish can be served at      room temperature as a salad, but make sure that you      slightly undercook the asparagus because it will continue      to cook as it cools.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 large fresh ripe tomatoes (or 5-6 Italian plum      tomatoes)</em> <em><br /></em> <em>1 teaspoon mild      oil<br />      1 clove garlic, minced<br />      1/8 teaspoon jalapeno pepper, minced<br />      2 tablespoons fresh lime juice<br />      1/2 teaspoon sugar<br />      1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<br />      1/4 teaspoon oregano<br />      1/4 teaspoon thyme<br />      dash of salt<br />      1 pound asparagus, trimmed and steamed</em>    </p>    <p>      Using a long fork or knife, roast the tomatoes one at a      time directly over a high gas flame until the skin becomes      charred in spots, blistered, and loose. Insert a knife into      the core of the tomatoes, one at a time, and roast them      over a high gas flame. Cool a few minutes, then peel off      the skin, core, and finely chop. Sauté the garlic      and pepper in oil on medium-high heat briefly while      stirring. Add the tomatoes and the rest of the ingredients.      Stir and turn off the heat so that the sauce cooks for not      even 30 seconds. Steam the asparagus and serve it topped      with a few spoonfuls of sauce.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COLORS</strong><br />      American asparagus is the familiar green, while European is      either purple or white.    </p>    <h3>      Asian Asparagus    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 pound fresh asparagus, cut diagonally into 1      "pieces</em> <em><br />      1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted*<br />      1 teaspoon sesame or walnut oil (or any mild oil)<br />      1 small clove garlic, minced<br />      2 teaspoons rice vinegar (or white wine vinegar)<br />      1 tablespoon tamari (soy sauce)<br />      1 teaspoon sugar<br />      2 teaspoons fresh ginger root-peeled and grated<br />      1 tablespoon sherry or rice wine<br />      1 tablespoon water<br />      few dashes chili oil or cayenne pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      Sauté the garlic a few seconds. Stir together the      rest of the ingredients and pour into the skillet. Add the      asparagus and cook for about 2 minutes on medium heat until      the asparagus is done but still a little crisp. Serve      topped with sesame seeds.    </p>    <p>      *To toast sesame seeds: Place them in a small heated      skillet on medium-high heat. Heat for about one minute,      stirring often so they don't burn. Remove from pan      immediately when they begin to "smell toasted."    </p>    <h3>      Smoked Salmon and Asparagus with Linguine    </h3>    <p>      I buy smoked salmon at a local fishery where it's smoked      but still moist and not too salty. If you can't get smoked      salmon, grill some fresh salmon steaks with leftovers for      this simple pasta dish the following day.    </p>    <p>      <em>4 large cloves garlic, minced<br />      1 tablespoon olive oil<br />      3/4 cup unsalted chicken broth<br /></em> <em>few dashes      cayenne pepper<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      1 pound asparagus (about 1 1/2 cups), trimmed and cut on      the diagonal into 1 " pieces<br />      1/4 cup white wine<br />      1/2 pound smoked salmon, deboned and cut into 1      "pieces<br />      12 ounces linguine<br />      4 cup freshly grated parmesan or romano cheese<br />      1/4 cup parsley, chopped</em>    </p>    <p>      In a large pot bring water to boil and add linguine. In a      skillet sauté the garlic in the oil for about 30      seconds. Add the chicken broth and seasonings and heat      until boiling. Add the asparagus and cook on medium to      medium-high heat for about 2 minutes until the asparagus is      almost done. Add the salmon just long enough to heat it,      stirring as little as possible so the salmon will remain in      pieces. Drain the linguine and toss linguine, salmon,      asparagus mixture, and cheese together in a large bowl.      Serve topped with parsley and additional cheese if you so      desire.    </p>    <h3>      Asparagus Frittata    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon butter<br /></em> <em>8-10 asparagus spears,      tough ends removed and cut on the diagonal into 1/2"      pieces<br />      2 tablespoons onion, minced, or 2 small shallots, peeled      and minced<br />      2 eggs<br />      dash milk<br />      dash cayenne pepper, salt<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      1 teaspoon mild oil<br />      2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan or pecorino romano      cheese<br />      chives, chopped (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Turn on the oven broiler. In an 8" nonstick skillet      sauté the asparagus and onion in 1 teaspoon of      butter for a minute or so-just until the asparagus is      tender. Remove from the pan. In blender blend the eggs,      milk, and seasonings. Heat the oil over medium-high heat      until the pan is hot. Pour the egg mixture into the pan,      tilting it to evenly coat the bottom. After about 30      seconds, lift up the egg in a few places to let the runny      egg out. Reduce heat to medium when the bottom is light      brown. Top the eggs with the asparagus and then the      parmesan cheese. Be sure to wrap aluminum foil around the      pan's handle if it is wooden. Put the pan under the broiler      for about 30-60 seconds, watching so that the eggs don't      burn. Remove from the broiler and slice in half. Top with      chives. Serves 2.    </p>
