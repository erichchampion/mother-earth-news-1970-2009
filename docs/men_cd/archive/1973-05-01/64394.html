    <p>
                        <p>      MOTHER NO. 20 contained some feedback on my statements in      NO. 19 about the advantages of direct over alternating      current, and I'd like to offer a rebuttal that's based on      my own experience . . . not on theory, as the criticisms      seem to be.    </p>    <p>      First of all, an alleged danger of D.C. is that one might      not be able to let go of the electrodes that are producing      the shock. Now, I've been hearing that statement all my      life, and I'm convinced that it's nothing but theory, with      no real foundation. I've had all sorts of shocks-up      to and including one of 10,000 volts, when one contact was      with my left had and the other with both feet thoroughly      grounded-and I've never felt any inclination to hold      on. On the contrary, either kind of current causes an      irresistible urge to disengage, which some people feel so      strongly that they claim the jolt has "knocked me down".      I've seen victims do some wild jumping, but I've never seen      one want to continue grasping the conductor.    </p>    <p>      In fact, I wonder whether shocks are necessarily as deadly      as is generally believed. That time I was hit with 10,000      volts (A.C.) I didn't dare pick up a cup of coffee for      three days afterward because I was sure I'd slosh it all      over the room. I was convinced that my nervous system had      had it . . . yet a week later I was as good as new. If some      people's notions are true, my heart must have moved out of      the way.    </p>    <p>      Yes, I admit that even a small current could kill you if it      passed through the heart . . . but to accomplish that you'd      probably have to introduce electrodes into the organ.      Actually, of course, a current (unless it's of very high      frequency) doesn't flow through one geometric line, but      through a considerable area. In a case like my accident,      one's heart might or might not get a lethal amount.    </p>    <p>      By the way, Peter Grant's statement that the body's      resistance is only 500 ohms is clearly out of line . . .      it's known that across any substantial part of the      anatomy-as from hand to hand-the figure is well      up in the thousands of ohms. Since I had no exact data of      my own on this point, I made a test by thoroughly wetting      my hands and grasping the prods of an ohmmeter. I got a      reading of <em>50,000</em> ! I then attached the prods to      sizable pieces of metal (something no one would do where      there was shock hazard). When I again wet my hands and      gripped these conductors, I couldn't get the indicator      below 20,000 ohms.    </p>    <p>      Now don't misunderstand me! Current can be dangerous,      especially if you don't know what you're doing, and there      are some chances no one should take. (For example, don't      risk shocks of <em>any</em> kind when you're working in a      high place . . . on a windmill, perhaps. If you feel the      current it's likely that you'll instinctively jump away      from it, and you may lose your hold and fall.)      Nevertheless, there's a theory-one I subscribe      to-that most so-called shock deaths are really caused      by fright. Certainly a severe jolt can be an alarming      experience.    </p>    <p>      But whether or not electricity is as harmful to the body as      most people think, I continue to believe that the danger is      less from D.C. than from A.C. . . . and with reason. By the      time I was ten years old we kids had our workshop (an      abandoned corncrib) stocked with enough No. 6 dry cells to      give us 110 volts D.C., which we played with all the time.      If we'd fooled around with that much A.C. I doubt that I'd      be writing now.    </p>    <p>      I've also done some experiments since then that bear out my      belief. For instance, at one time a neighboring town had a      community generating plant that put out 110 volts D.C. When      I was in that facility with some other workers installing      electrical equipment, I got to wondering what that amount      of direct current would feel like. Then an opportunity      presented itself and I grasped the blades of the main      switch. I'm sure that my hands couldn't have been very      drysince we were working in a rather warm room-and I      didn't put anything on them to increase resistance . . .      yet I could feel only the ripple of the current, which      wasn't at all uncomfortable. I held on until my skin began      to get hot, at which point no effort was required to      release the control . . . I simply let go.    </p>    <p>      Here's another case: In the early days of radio a good many      receivers-including all amateur models-were      D.C., and tubes required a plate voltage of 90 volts of      direct current. Since "B" batteries weren't being made (or      at least weren't available locally), some of us solved the      problem by building battery holders that would contain 60      flashlight "D" cells connected together in series. Because      this was little more than a "breadboard" arrangement, I've      felt 90 volts D.C. many times. There's certainly no      tendency to hang on and the sensation isn't very      disagreeable. But don't try touching 90 volts A.C. or      you'll learn something fast.    </p>    <p>      I have 400 volts D.C. available right here beside me, and      use it frequently. I have often come into contact with that      source, but I don't take any special precautions because I      know it isn't very dangerous . . . much less so than 110      volts A.C. I'll stick to my guns and continue to recommend      direct current if you can possibly get it. It's safer and      more satisfactory.    </p>    <p>      You see, I feel safe with my conclusions because they're      based on experience. Theory can work well when it's correct      and complete . . . but when it's founded largely on hearsay      and not backed by practice, it can be dangerous.    </p>
