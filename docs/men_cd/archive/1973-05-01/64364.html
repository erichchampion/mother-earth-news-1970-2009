                   <h5 id="byline">	 by LEN AND KATHRYN SUE JONES	 </h5>        <p>      Ever shuffled out of the house at four a.m. with a fishing      pole over your shoulder? Nearly every country boy can      remember at least one daybreak of rounding up cheese,      angleworms, night crawlers, dough balls or chicken parts,      and running off for some good catfishin'.    </p>    <p>      Matter of fact, many of those boys don't quit when they      grow up. Take me, for instance. Though I greatly enjoy the      sporting aspects of wetting a line, I'm also a staunch      "meat" fisherman. That is, I like to pursue a quarry that I      can appreciate on the table . . . which is why I'm such an      avid fan of catfish. The critters are common and      widespread, bite when other fish won't, reach super sizes .      . . and, above all, are incredibly tasty. My family of      three here in Maryland enjoys this whiskered delight at      least once a month, and-since catfish are available      to most folks-their nutritional goodness can become      an important part of anyone's diet.    </p>    <p>      Like to try catfishing? Get up bright and early one morning      and head for the nearest river, lake or farm pond.      Nighttime will also produce good results. In fact, "cats"      can be caught quite readily at all times of the day, at all      water temperatures and depths. The best time to plan your      expedition, however, is after a heavy rain . . . especially      in the spring. When other fairweather fish are sluggish and      temperamental, the hungry catfish forage about in the      freshly rejuvenated waters.    </p>    <p>      If you fish regularly, you probably have a favorite spot.      If not, just ask some of the local old-timers. Though      angling stories are famed for their dishonesty, there's      generally some darn good tips in them somewhere!    </p>    <p>      I prefer an old-fashioned bait-casting rod and reel but      almost any type of arrangement-from Grandma's cane      pole to a fancy spinning rig-will catch a catfish.      Use a small-to-medium-sized hook and a sinker that's heavy      enough to keep your bait on the bottom, in cat territory.      The weight needed to do this will vary depending on water      conditions.    </p>         <p>      Most conceivable baits will entice these tasty critters,      but garden worms are the old standby (Just don't take too      many out of the vegetable patch!). Cast a generous bait to      the bottom, and wait for the slow, deliberate tugging which      signals that a catfish is biting. Above all, be patient!    </p>    <p>      If the water you've chosen to fish is muddy, sluggish or      still, you're very likely to catch a bullhead (a member of      the catfish family that grows to no more than 20 inches      long and 4-1/2 pounds in weight). All of the three common      color phases of the bullhead-black, brown and      yellow-have pink meat that's sweet and fine. Faster,      clearer water will generally turn up nice channel and blue      cats (especially from that little pool beneath a steady      current where natural nutrients abound). The variety really      doesn't matter, however, because all catfish are readily      distinguishable from other fish (by the "whiskers" or barbs      that grow out of their upper jaws, and the      skin-instead of scales-on their bodies) and all      are among the finest eating anywhere.    </p>    <p>      Once you've landed your eatin'-size fish (eight inches and      up), you're faced with the procedure of dressing him out.      No problem. First, grip the critter so that his three      protruding fin spines are firmly extended <em>between</em>      your fingers. Beware of those spikes . . . they can easily      inflict a painful, long-lasting wound! Next-with a      sharp knife-cut a shallow ring about the fish's neck,      immediately behind the gill openings.    </p>            <p>      Since all catfish are scaleless they must be completely      skinned . . . but the operation is actually pretty easy.      Grasp the edge of your incision with a handy pair of pliers      and simply peel the skin down banana style. Then remove the      head, fins, tail and entrails so that you're left with a      large piece of meat that is ready to be washed, cooked and      eaten. (Incidentally, the above system works for other      scaleless fish and rattlesnakes!)    </p>    <p>      How will you cook your catfish? There are probably about a      million ways, all of 'em good, so I'll just give three      popular methods of preparation that my family likes.    </p>    <p>      The simplest smoker I know is merely a worn-out or      discarded refrigerator with a few minor alterations. First      remove the guts of the machine and knock a fist-sized or      larger hole in the cabinet's floor. Second, drill 6-10      one-inch holes in each side and in the door, about      three-quarters of the way up. Then put one more hole in the      top and-when the results of a smoldering fire are      introduced through the opening in the cabinet's      bottom-you have an effective smokehouse. The racks      may be retained for hanging your fish. I've sampled      bullhead prepared in this homemade wonder, and it was truly      delicious.    </p>    <p>      By the way, a very complete little manual on fish smoking,      salting, curing and canning is available for $1.00 from:    </p>    <p>      Netcraft Company<br />      3101 Sylvania Road<br />      Toledo, Ohio 43613    </p>   <h3>HOT-SMOKED CATFISH</h3>    <p>      [1] Skin any size "cat" and remove its entrails.<br />      [2] Make a brine solution of 1 pound salt to each gallon of      water and immerse the meat in the liquid overnight.<br />      [3] Place the catfish in dry salt for 1-3 hours. Then wash      it thoroughly.<br />      [4] Dry the fish outdoors for 1-3 hours.<br />      [5] Hang the meat securely in a smoker so that the pieces      don't touch and aren't overcrowded.<br />      [6] Stack wood at the entrance of the smoker tunnel and      start a small, steady fire. Ideal fuels are seasoned maple,      birch, oak, hickory, sweet bay, river mangrove, palmetto      roots, buttonwood, orange, cypress and apple . . . or      corncobs or coconut husks(!).<br />      [7] When the fire is smoldering steadily-not      blazing-close the smoker door. The desired smudgy      combustion can be maintained by dousing the coals regularly      with sawdust, etc.<br />      [8] After a few hours of hot-smoking (100-150Â° F), your      fish is ready to be eaten or kept for up      to-roughly-four weeks, depending on how long it      was cured.<br />      [9] Wrap the meat in paper and store it in wooden boxes in      a cool, dry place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CATFISH STEW</strong>    </p>    <p>      6 small catfish, cleaned<br />      1 pint milk<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      1 /4 teaspoon salt<br />      pepper to tasty    </p>    <p>      Boil your "cats" until their flesh can be separated from      the bones. Then dice the meat and put the pieces in a      saucepan with the other ingredients. Heat the rich brew and      serve.    </p>    <p>      This is a general recipe. Any combination of vegetables and      may prove tasty with the basic mixture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FRIED CATFISH</strong>    </p>    <p>      cleaned catfish<br />      enough egg, beaten, to coat above<br />      mixture of cornmeal and flour<br />      oil or shortening<br />      salt and pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      Dip the fish in the raw beaten egg, then roll the chunks of      meat in the cornmeal-flour mixture. Drop the prepared piece      in a pan of hot oil and jump back. Brown them quickly on on      both sides and serve. Absolutely delicious!    </p>
