    <p>
                    <p>      A plant is like a self-willed man, out of whom we can      obtain all which we desire, if we will only treat him his      own way.-GOETHE    </p>    <p>      For the small farmer, no single crop, area for area, will      yield as much as the vegetable garden. When James Norman      Hall was living in Tahiti, there was a shortage of familiar      fruits and vegetables, and what few there were, were      motley. The papayas and mangoes tasted great, but      occasionally he longed for a good lettuce and tomato      sandwich. Or so the story goes. He had a friend of his send      him a large package of assorted superseeds to plant. Hall      was busy with his writing, however; his garden suffered      from neglect, and eventually expired from total insect      devastation. He gave the remaining seeds to some Chinese      friends, thinking that perhaps they could at least salvage      a few vegetables for their family. Five months later, after      carefully tending their new garden, his friends returned a      huge basket of vegetables to him. Two years later he was      still getting a basket a week-nd the industrious      farmers were supplying almost all the fresh vegetables to      the town of Papeete. And that's more or less the story of      any vegetable patch. Good seed and good care give      superabundance.    </p>    <p>      How big you want your garden to be depends not only on how      much vegetables are part of your diet, but which ones as      well. The yield of tomatoes, say, is much greater than that      for sweet corn occupying the same amount of ground. A      one-hundred-by-one-hundred-foot garden should yield an      ample supply for four plus guests. To help you plan your      garden, the approximate yield per hundred-foot row is given      for each vegetable in this chapter.    </p>    <h3>      LOCATION    </h3>    <p>      If you keep chickens, the likeliest spot for your vegetable      garden is someplace where you can fence off half the area      for a chicken yard and plant on the other half. The next      year, rotate so that what was the chicken yard becomes the      vegetable garden, and vice versa. The double yard makes for      healthier chickens and gives you prefertilized soil to work      with as well.    </p>    <p>      The garden should be on well-drained soil, preferably a      gentle slope to the south if you have one. Sloping assures      drainage, and southern hills warm up the best during cool      springs and autumns, giving the plants on them extra      growing strength. The difference between flat land and a      sunny southern slope can mean as much as a      two-months-longer growing season. But don't forget to      follow the contour of the hill with your rows, erosion will      eventually wipe out the benefits of the site. Also, the      tallest plants should be located at the northern end of the      garden. A couple of rows of high sweet corn along the south      side, for instance, could shade a large portion of your      garden for most of the day. Your vegetables will want sun,      every bit of it they can get, so if you can't give them a      slope exposed to the south, make sure the garden is at at      least away from tall trees and in the open.    </p>    <h3>      SOIL TESTING    </h3>    <p>      Your field and forage crops will thrive without your      knowing the soil too intimately. You'll know if it's acidic      and needs lime; you'll fertilize the fields with animal and      green manure. But since there you're working with large      areas and less than absolute precision, if a couple of      square feet in a field don't yield as heavily as the rest,      your overall harvest won't be affected much. In the      vegetable garden, however, if a hundred-foot row of      potatoes doesn't grow because you've limed the soil, that's      the end of your entire crop. Test the soil before you stake      out and plant your vegetable garden, particularly those      first few years when you're building up the soil and      learning how things grow.    </p>    <p>      Most state agricultural colleges or experiment stations      have facilities for running soil tests on your samples. But      if you not close to one or the other, the processing could      take time and be a bit on the expensive side. If you're in      a rush to get started, a soil-testing kit is a great      time-saver. With it you can check things out right on the      spot.    </p>    <p>      A simple pH kit is inexpensive and easy to use. You just      moisten the innocent-looking paper against the soil. The      paper changes color. Match that color with the chart, and      presto, you get a pH number.    </p>    <p>      The larger, more expensive soil kits will give you, besides      a pH rating and without much more work, a      nitrogen-phosphoruspotassium breakdown. You put some soil      into a test tube, add reagents, and match against another      chart.    </p>    <p>      Remember when taking soil samples to use a clean shovel. If      you use one: that's been sitting in the manure pile all      morning, you won't believe how rich your soil tests      out-that is, you'd better not believe it. Also get      samples from different parts of your garden, since soil      conditions will vary. This doesn't mean you have to test      each square yard and then supply the specific ingredients      it lacks. Sample selectively the whole area you plan to      cultivate, mix all the samples together thoroughly, and      then test the mix. It will give you a good idea of what's      needed overall.    </p>    <h3>      FERTILIZER    </h3>    <p>      The richness of your vegetable plot will depend on five      factors, namely, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, organic      matter, and trace elements. The basic fertilizer source for      the garden will be the compost pile.    </p>    <p>      A good dose of compost, say two inches or more if you have      enough to go around, should be dug into the garden two or      three weeks before planting, while you're still tilling the      soil and have committed yourself to what you're going to      grow by leafing through all those glorious sped catalogs      and finally cutting down the list of vegetables you'd like      to manageable proportions before sending away for the      seeds.    </p>    <h3>      NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS & POTASSIUM: WHAT THEY DO    </h3>    <p>      Nitrogen: A basic building block of protein. Produces good      stem and leaf development. Makes plants succulent and      green.    </p>    <p>      Phosphorus: Stimulates root development in young plants.      Increases the proportion of fruit to plant. Speeds maturity      of crops, also increases plants' resistance to some      diseases.    </p>    <p>      Potassium: Essential in the formation of starches, sugar      and cellulose. Without it plants do not mature well. Also      aids in disease resistance, particularly those diseases      caused by fungi.    </p>    <p>      If your soil test indicated a lack of nitrogen, phosphorus      or potassium, the deficiency can be remedied easily by      adding material rich in the needed element to the soil.      Apply it along with the compost before planting. If your      soil is very low in one element, concoct a compost heap      that will compensate for it. Low in nitrogen? Add extra      animal manure, tankage, blood meal, fish scraps, and so      forth. Phosphorus-deprived? Acid phosphate rock, bone meal,      tankage, incinerator ash. Low in potassium'? Throw in some      seaweed (wash the salt off if you gathered your own,      otherwise it will build up in the soil), green sand, wood      ash, or cocoa shell.    </p>    <p>      Once you've given your garden plot its initial composting      planted all those rows of good seeds and watched how they      grow, more fertilizer may be added for the mature plants.      Take well-composted material and spread it along the sides      of the rows, being careful not to cover the growing plant      stems. If you raise the soil level around the stem of a      plant by stacking up compost against it, you may induce      stem rot. Besides, the fine roots of the plant, the ones      that absorb most of the nutrients from the soil are some      distance away from the main stem. This side dressing of      ompost between the rows will slowly filter down into the      soil, providing continuous nourishment for those hungry      little roots. At the same time it acts as a mulch, keeping      down weeds and retaining moisture in the soil.    </p>    <h3>      SEEDING    </h3>    <p>      Many vegetables are given a head start by by indoor      planting.<br />    </p>    <p>      For those that take more than ninety days to reach maturity      or bearing age, the early start is almost a necessity in      the northern half of the country if you expect to got much      of a harvest. Plant the seeds in pots or wooden flats, or      trays. If you use flats (preferred because they lend      themselves to row planting), don't make them too long.      You're going to be lugging them in and out of doors later.    </p>    <p>      Since the mature plants are going to have to adjust to life      in the cold, cruel world outside, soil for the seedlings      should not be superrich. Spread the bottom fourth of the      flat with sphagnum moss or pure humus. Fill the rest of the      flat with good-quality but not overly rich soil, leaving      enough room to cover the seeds with an adequately thick      layer. Sow the seeds thinly in rows, and over them spread      compost to the proper depth for that type of seed. To give      your seeds an easy start, use sifted compost as a cover.      That is, take your best-quality compost and rub it through      mosquito screening. Spray water gently over the top of the      soil to help the seeds settle in.    </p>    <p>      Keep the beds moist by covering with glass or plastic, but      lift the cover at least twice a day to circulate air. Water      the trays by dunking the bottoms in water for a few minutes      rather than watering from the top. This will aid root      development while keeping the plants from damping off.      Damping off is caused by a fungus disease that thrives when      the surface soil around a young plant stern is damp. The      fungus attacks the young, tender stem. The plant keels over      and dies. So don't overwater. If any fungus develops on the      soil, scrape it away immediately and leave the cover off.      You'll be taking the cover off anyway when the first shoots      break the surface of the soil. Don't let the plants crowd.      If several have come up in one spot, pull out the weakest      ones. Keep the flats indoors in a warm, sunny spot.    </p>    <p>      When the first two regular leaves, as opposed to the seed      leaves, have developed, the seedlings should be spaced out,      two inches apart, in two-inch rows. Dig them up with a soil      bundle around the roots, plant them in a new flat filled      with ordinary soil that is friable, but not too rich. If      the soil seems to pack tightly, mix in some sharp sand or      vermiculite.    </p>    <p>      Somewhat poor soil at this stage of the game will make the      roots shoot around looking for better stuff. This gives      your plants a solid foundation for future growth.    </p>    <p>      The new flats are still kept indoors in a sunny spot with      night temperatures not above 60° F. However, as soon as      the days begin to warm up, take them out to the yard daily,      and bring them in again at night. This will acclimatize      them to conditions outside. After a week of exercising      yourself by carrying the flats back and forth, the plants      are ready to be transplanted to the garden. Wait till after      the last killing frost in your region, of course.    </p>        <p>      A cold frame can be used to house the flats outdoors      instead of lugging them around. The principle of the cold      frame is that it blocks off chilling winds, at the same      time permitting the radiant heat of the sun to penetrate,      keeping the plants all warm and cozy. The cold frame is      opened during the warmest part of the day to prevent      steamed vegetables and allow the circulation of fresh air.      The degree to which it is opened depends on the day's      temperature. Your objective is to keep the inside      temperature in the 60° to 70°F. range. A      thermometer will give you an indication of how much to open      the frame. Close it early in the afternoon so enough heat      is retained to keep the plants cozy at night. If you find      night temperatures inside the cold frame falling below      40°F., you should move the seedlings indoors.    </p>    <p>      When growing seedlings in flats, indoors or in a cold      frame, a week before they are to be set out in the garden      take a sharp knife and cut the soil to the bottom of the      flats so that each plant has its own individual cube of      earth. This will cut any overlapping roots. At the same      time, the plants will have a week to recover from the      surgery and develop new hair roots within their own      territory, thus lessening transplant shock. Individual peat      starter pots save a lot of work and trouble, and with mass      production their costs are declining to the point where      they might be worth considering.    </p>    <p>      Transplant from flats to the garden when all danger of      frost is past and the plants have developed numerous      healthy leaves. For an extra head start, you can set out      some plants before the frost-free date, but make sure to      mulch them heavily. Late afternoon or evening is the best      time to transplant. Water the garden well to insure      settling in of the roots. Since young plants should not be      exposed to direct sunlight the first two days after being      transplanted outside, and since cutworms will try to do to      your plants just what their name implies, it's a good idea      to put a paper collar around each plant and cover the whole      thing lightly with mulch. Don't mulch between the rows of      collared plants, however, or the mulch will retain too much      of that good dousing of water you gave the garden, and also      keep the soil from warming up in the sun.    </p>        <p>      If you think you're going to have enough to do around the      farm without cold-framing and transplanting a whole lot of      seedlings, except maybe the tomato and pepper plants, you      can still speed up getting the vegetable patch going.      Cloche gardening -covering crops in the fields with      portable glass or plastic greenhouses-makes direct      planting in the garden possible earlier. This type of      temporary greenhouse has given excellent results in      extending the growing season in the more northern      latitudes, such as New England.    </p>    <p>      The cloche protects seeds and plants from frost. At the      same time, moisture is retained, and rain running off the      top and sides enters the ground away from the plants,      assuring that the soil directly around them does not cake      or pack, even without hoeing.    </p>    <p>      A modern version of the cloche can be made by inverting      U-shaped frames at one-foot intervals over the rows to be      seeded. Coat hangers or willow branches work well. The      maximum width you'll want at the base is twenty inches.      After seeding, the upside-down U's are covered with      polyethylene. Each end of the tunnel is folded over to      retain heat and moisture. Open the tunnel around eleven in      the morning for ventilation and close at three or four      o'clock for the evening. But be sure to keep the tunnel      closed during windy days or it will take off.    </p>        <p>      There's still, of course, the old tried and true method of      planting a vegetable garden. As soon as the frost season is      past, you sow the seeds in the garden, cover them up to the      appropriate depth, using sifted compost if possible, and      stand back. Except for weeding, weeding, and weeding.    </p>    <p>      But do you have to weed? Not any more. A well-kept garden      on healthy soil is easy to care for if you use mulch.    </p>    <h3>      MULCHING    </h3>    <p>      By spreading a layer of organic material on the soil around      your crops you can assure that the soil retains its      moisture, and most weeds are eliminated because when they      germinate and come up in the darkness beneath the mulch      they wither away. Meanwhile, this mulch slowly decays,      adding more natural organic material to the soil.    </p>    <p>      You can mulch along or between the rows of seedlings you      set out from flats at once, but, except for mulch on top of      a cutworm collar, it's better to wait a couple of days,      since you've watered the plants heavily to insure root      setting and you don't want the mulch to retain a lot of      excess water. When you do mulch the young plants, leave an      unmulched circle about six inches in diameter around each      one for the first two weeks. After that you can bring the      mulch almost up to the stems.    </p>    <p>      When sowing seeds directly in the garden, mulch between all      the rows, but not right on top of where the young plants      will come up. Wait till the plants are well formed, then      weed around them if necessary, and mulch again. Mulch      whenever the old material has decayed and compacted enough      to permit weeds to sprout. You never have to weed an      established garden. When you see some unwanted plants, just      cover them with mulch. Not only will they die from lack of      light, but they will contribute to the soil as they decay.    </p>    <p>      Mulch can vary from an inch to a foot in thickness. The      basic rule of thumb is, the finer the material, the thinner      the layer. When mulching with something like hay, you      approach the one-foot level-after your plants are      considerably taller than that, of course. Finer mulch, such      as ground corncobs, peanut or cocoa hulls, or sawdust, need      only be an inch or two. One last word: The soil must be      able to breathe through the mulch. For this reason, you      can't use materials, such as leaves, that will bind      together into flat cakey layers with no air penetration. At      least don't use them directly above the plant roots;      between the rows is all right if you absolutely have to.      But then, you shouldn't have to, since they'd be better off      in your compost pile.    </p>    <p>      So much for cultivating your garden. Just stand back and      wait for the harvest. It will be the better for the mulch.      Cucumbers, melons, and other ground-lying crops, for      instance, won't become soft and rot, because they're      resting on loose, dry mulch, not the ground. As for the      harvesting, well, you'll know a country-fresh sun-ripened      tomato or pepper when you see a real one, and a sweet ear      of corn or pod of tiny new peas once you've tasted your      first.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT TO PLANT, AND WHEN AND HOW    </h3>    <p>      You'll have no trouble making a grocery list for your      garden. But the varieties to choose from for each vegetable      often make almost as long a list. Those recommended here      are good basic ones for the beginner. There might, however,      be varieties better for your specifc region. What are your      neighbors growing? Try those, but don't forget to      experiment a little too. You may find a couple of your      favorites missing from the list that follows. Well, some of      us never could stand Brussels sprouts ....    </p>    <p>      Planting periods for specific vegetables (given under the      heading "Time to plant" in the charts that follow) vary      greatly with the region you're in. The things to remember      are: the average last killing frost is just that, the      average date of the last killing frost in your region; the      frost-free date is the date after which there will be too      frost at all (not all frosts are severe enough to kill the      plants), and this is usually two to three weeks after the      <em>average</em> date of the last killing frost. So much      for the frosts. "Early spring" refers to the week or two      after the average last killing frost. "Very early spring"      means you can begin planting even before all danger of      frost is past.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, I'm all for overproduction rather than under.      In fact, continuous production is to your benefit. Sow      seeds of any given vegetables once a week over the duration      of their planting period. This will turn your garden into a      movable salad bowl. And nothing goes to waste on a farm.      Extra vegetables can always be frozen, canned, pickled,      salted and stored in the root cellar for a winter supply or      fed to the livestock. Even if they spoil, they're returned      to the soil by way of the compost pile. Besides, if you      find that five of your tomato plants are yielding all you      can eat and you've got twenty, you can always take the      extra tomatoes with you to town the next time you go and      sell them to the greengrocer. You won't make a mint, but      it'll pay for the gas. Or put up a roadside stand if you're      well located for one. And of course you'll have friends      dropping by who will be more than helpful in removing your      excess yield.    </p>        <p>      Asparagus takes more work initially than most garden      vegetables. On the other hand, you'll be rewarded for your      labors with a crop bearing for at least ten years, and in      some cases up to fifteen or twenty years.    </p>    <p>      Remember to place your asparagus bed in a part of the      garden that will remain untouched in the future, because      it's going to be there awhile. Usually asparagus is planted      at the edge of the garden, sometimes even completely      separate from it in a corner of the yard-but not      where it will be shaded by trees, and not where the      chickens will be ranging every other year.    </p>    <p>      A deep, loamy, fertile soil that is well drained suits the      plant best. The last requirement is the most important;      asparagus will grow in almost any soil as long as it is      well drained.    </p>    <p>      First thing, as soon as the ground can be worked in spring,      decide how long you are going to make the bed. Two      fifty-foot beds will yield as much as one a hundred feet      long. Drive in a stake at either end of what will be the      bed and draw a string between them.    </p>    <p>      Now comes the work. Dig a trench twelve inches deep by      twelve inches wide the whole length of the bed. Over the      bottom of each hundred feet of trench spread twenty pounds      of ground limestone and fifteen pounds of phosphate rock.      Moisten and dig into the bottom of the trench. Cover with a      four-inch layer of quality compost. Some well-rotted      manure, four months or older, may also be added. Work it      all into the bottom again.    </p>    <p>      Lay your asparagus roots at eighteen-inch intervals along      the trench; they should be about ten inches from the top.      It's a good idea to buy 50 percent more rootstock than you      intend to plant and dispose of the small weak ones. Cover      with two inches of fine sifted compost. Water well and wait      two or three weeks. Add another inch of compost and soil to      the trench every two weeks until the trench is filled. This      is only an approximate schedule. The object of the game is      to let the tips keep growing a little higher than the soil      level at all times.    </p>    <p>      By the time the first freeze of the fall approaches, the      trench should have been filled. However, additional winter      protection is needed. Mulch with compost, hay, well-rotted      manure, or whatever is handy. So much for the first year's      work.    </p>    <p>      Come spring, you rake off the mulch and leave it between      the rows, or on the sides if you only have one row. Loosen      the soil in the pit gently to a depth of six inches. No      more, or you might injure the rootstock. Now make a hill of      compost about one inch high over the length of the pit. As      the warm spring weather continues, shoots will develop. Let      them reach a height of six to eight inches; then, digging      around them gently, harvest them by cutting off two inches      below the soil. They must be picked daily or they go to      seed. The first year's harvest shouldn't be extended for      more than two weeks. The second year, cutting may be      extended to a total of six weeks. This is the optimum      length of time for the following years' harvest as well.    </p>    <p>      After your harvesting is done, shoots will keep coming up.      Let these develop into lacy asparagus bushes, essential to      the strength of your bed. Leave the bushes as part of the      winter mulch.    </p>    <p>      Mary Washington is resistant to asparagus rust. Still the      beds should never be located in areas of frequent dampness,      heavy dews, or mists, because these encourage the formation      of rust.    </p>        <p>      Once the plants begin to develop, say, when they're six      inches tall, apply manure as side dressing. That is, place      manure on either side of the plant, but no closer than two      inch since it can be burned by direct contact. This is      particularly true of chicken manure; use it only for      digging into the oil in the fall for next year's planting.    </p>        <p>      Snap beans used to be called string beans and still are in      most places, But they shouldn't be, since the Department      Agriculture decided the old name made poor public relations      and snap beans was a snappier image. They still taste      great, whatever you call them, fresh off the vine, picked      just before maturity. The plant forms a bush about eighteen      inches high.    </p>    <p>      Sow the seeds directly into the garden. Cultivate very      shallowly for weeds. Better yet, mulch away the weeds. The      play grow in almost any soil as long as it is not too acid.      However, beans do best on rich soils, so compost well.    </p>        <p>      The beet is a native of North Africa, particularly around      Egypt, from where the variety with that name came. Beets      will thrive on just about any soil as long as it's not      acid. They attract few pests and are in general very easy      to grow. Since they have deep roots, loose, friable loam      will give best results. If your soil tends to cake,      incorporate plenty of organic matter. Don't use fresh      manure. Well-rotted manure is fine.    </p>    <p>      When the tops reach the six-inch stage, beets often have to      be thinned. This is because the "seed" is not an actual      seed, but a fruit containing several seeds. The pulled      beets can be transplanted. But why bother? You'll no doubt      have enough without them. Instead, use the tender pulled      beets whole and raw in a good country salad. Although it's      fun to grow superbeets, for the tastiest eating pull the      baby ones when they are less than an inch and a half in      diameter.    </p>    <p>      Beet greens are an excellent source of vitamins A and C and      iron. So learn to think of them as a salad crop as well as      a root crop.    </p>        <p>      <br />      This plant belongs to the <em>Brassica</em> , one of the      most diversified vegetable groups. Included in the clan are      cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, and kale. It is highly      nutritious and easy to grow. Start a spring crop in flats      and transplant after the last frost. For a fall crop, plant      directly in the garden in late May. Soil should be deeply      dug. Drainage is more important than soil quality.    </p>    <p>      A broccoli plant will be about two feet tall when ready for      cutting. Watch carefully that the buds do not open before      you harvest. Cut off only the main head. The little buds on      the remaining stem will now head out. You can get six to      eight cuttings off one stem.    </p>    <p>      The plant is not prone to disease, but it does attract      cabbage worms. Crop rotation is a vital preventative.      Always grow the whole <em>Brassica</em> group in rotation,      so no member of the family grows on soil where another has      been cultivated in the past two years.    </p>        <p>      One of the most popular of the garden vegetables, and      rightly so. You'll want to grow a fair amount because of      its good storage qualities and to make sauerkraut. Soil      moisture is important, so mulch well. As to the soil      itself, cabbage isn't fussy, but it needs cool, humid      weather for the best heading. Hence the late-maturing fall      plants are preferred. Fall plants also make bigger cabbage      heads.    </p>    <p>      Sow both early and late varieties in flats first and      transplant as four-inch seedlings, or about six weeks after      indoor planting. Liming will help keep down some pests,      such as clubroot. Others-for instance, the cabbage      worm, cabbage looper, and harlequin bug-should be      picked off by hand when spotted.    </p>        <p>      A crop of increasing and well-deserved popularity. Stores      well in the root cellar for up to two months. Needs cool      weather, otherwise plants will develop a seed stalk instead      of the head.    </p>    <p>      Sow directly into the garden. Thin when three inches tall      and use the young pulled greens for salad. Remaining plants      will need good evening watering during dry spells. Mulching      helps; Chinese cabbage needs richly fertilized, moist soil.    </p>        <p>      Cantaloupes are actually a variety of hard-rinded      muskmelon. Their cultivation parallels that of cucumbers.      Plenty of moisture, particularly during fruiting, and rich      organic material are the key. In addition, sunny warmth is      necessary. Cool temperatures or even continuously cloudy      days will decrease yield and quality.    </p>    <p>      Cantaloupes, and for that matter most melons, are planted      in small, raised mounds of earth, or hills. This produces      bigger and better plants. You don't have to build a      pyramid; a hill four to six inches high and a foot in      diameter will do admirably. Mix in some aged manure when      building the mounds.    </p>    <p>      Melons are best when field-ripened and picked just before      eating. The way to tell a ripe one from its underripe      neighbor is to push gently with the thumb at the joint      where vine and melon merge. They should separate after even      a light touch when the fruit is really ripe.    </p>    <p>      The cucumber beetle attacks cantaloupes too. Since you      should already have marigolds growing by the cucumber vine      (see the chapter on "Pest Control"), you might think it a      bright idea to plant your melons there as well. Don't. Keep      the two as far apart as possible, and plant a second batch      of marigolds near the cantaloupes. Crop concentration just      makes for greater temptation for the bugs.    </p>        <p>      Another easy-to-grow crop, with few insect enemies.      Well-drained, organically rich soil should be used. Drop      the seeds on top, then cover them with half an inch of      finely screened compost. Tamp this down with a board to      help eliminate air pockets. Carrot seeds, at 24,000 to an      ounce, are very small and need all the help they can get in      covering up snugly.    </p>    <p>      Often carrots and radishes are sown together and the      quick-maturing radishes harvested when the carrots are      first thinned. Thinning is essential for a good crop. And      there's nothing like the delightful earthy carroty smell      that surrounds you while you're at this task. You'll find      the tiny young carrots make delicious eating. Carrots for      winter storage are left in the ground till just after the      first frost.    </p>        <p>      A tricky crop and not worth growing the first year unless      you're a cauliflower nut. If you can, settle for broccoli.      If not, sow in cold frames, and transplant seedlings after      six weeks. Needs soil very high in organic matter,      moisture, and nitrogen. Water daily every evening during      dry spells.    </p>    <p>      Keep a sharp lookout for the young flower. When it is three      inches in diameter, you have to tie the cabbage leaves over      the flower like a Christmas present. Bows are not      necessary, but the flower must be totally protected from      light. Another method is simply to break the leaves over      the flower-of course, one good heavy wind and goodby      cauliflower crop. Cauliflower heads develop very rapidly.      They'll be ready for cutting five to twelve days after      bundling; the warmer the weather the faster the      development.<br />    </p>        <p>      An all-around, handy, easy-to-grow plant not often found      whole in the city. Young shoots, frequently sold as endive      in city markets, are for munching, the roots for boiling      like carrots or turnips. What makes chicory particularly      valuable is that it can be forced in winter to produce      fresh salad greens. To boot, the dried, roasted roots when      ground make a good coffee substitute, and for all your      farm's self-sufficiency, you're not going to be able to      grow real coffee in a temperate climate. Nor real tea, for      that matter.    </p>    <p>      It is a hardy crop, but likes well-drained, heavily manured      soil. Hardly any insect enemies or disease problems.    </p>    <p>      For winter endive, leave the roots in the ground through      the first few frosts. Dig them up and place them upright in      a box of soil with about two or three inches of soil      between the plants. Cover each crown with loose, moist sand      to a depth of seven inches. Store in an area where they      will not freeze, but where the temperature does not go much      above 40°F. Keep moist with a weekly watering. Two to      three weeks before you want to use them for salad, place      the box in a room where the temperature is 60° to      65° F. Give the spent rootstock to your animals for a      bit of winter variety.    </p>        <p>      100 clumps (or more than enough for a family of thirty-two)    </p>    <p>      Another handy plant for the homestead in need of winter      greens. Take a couple of the clumps indoors, planted to      trays, before freezing weather sets in. They'll give you      tasty fresh sprigs for soups all winter.    </p>    <p>      Chives like a very sunny location and rich, loose, pebbly      soil. The second spring, clumps left in the garden over the      winter can be dug up and the bulbs at the bottom of each      bunch divided so you get two plants. Cutting for salad      should be done with gusto, not trepidation, for the more      you cut, the better the plant survives.    </p>        <p>      There are probably five billion varieties by now, but the      old Golden Cross Bantam is a good way to settle the      confusion.    </p>        <p>      Yes, the Indians were right, a dead fish in each hill of      corn does help. But before you raid your sardine tins, in      case you're not near one of the coasts, try instead a good      application of well-rotted manure two weeks before      planting, or fresh manure the preceding fall.    </p>    <p>      Corn is hard on the soil, and fertilizer, particularly one      rich in nitrogen, should be used liberally. A winter crop      of clover is a good idea for this part of the garden.      Mulching and side-dressing are worthwhile.    </p>    <p>      Sweet corn should be harvested in the milk stage-and,      of course, the last possible minute before dinner. Break a      kernel with your fingernail; if the inside is milky liquid,      it's ready. Harvesting early, before the kernels reach the      dough stage, is particularly important if there are many      crows in your area and you'd still like to eat some of your      own corn.    </p>    <p>      Save a little dent corn from the field crop, if you plant      one, for parched corn, a tasty change from popcorn on a      winter's evening.    </p>        <p>      Will not grow in acid soils. Need loose, open soil. Sandy      soils are good if organic matter is high. Plowing under      animal manure the fall before planting is very helpful.    </p>    <p>      Unless mulched, cucumbers will need thorough weekly      cultivation. Plant six seeds to a hill and thin out the      three weakest when the plants are four inches high. Making      one-foot-wide, six-inch-deep trenches between cucumber rows      and filling them with well-rotted manure covered by an inch      of soil and some additional mulch helps assure a good crop      in dry weather. Water the trenches daily. The rich seepage      will boost plant growth.    </p>    <p>      Six to seven weeks after planting, small cucumbers will      form. Watch them carefully, because they're like balloons      being blown up. One day there's a mini-cucumber, the next      it's fifteen inches long. Cucumbers are over 96 percent      water. That's what fills them up so fast, and that's why      the cucumber crop is so moisture-dependent.    </p>    <p>      Healthy cucumber plants shouldn't be affected seriously by      pests or disease. However, the cucumber beetle, which also      spreads bacterial wilt, must be kept in check. Plant      marigolds around your cucumber plants. Personally, I never      did like them, but neither do the cucumber beetles. And I'd      rather have flowers than beetles. Wood ashes sprinkled on      the soil as fertilizer are an additional deterrent.    </p>        <p>      Bulbs give better results than seeds, and results they do      give. Don't drop any on your way to the garden or you'll      have a Hansel and Gretel trail growing all the way back to      the house come summer. Break the big bulb into cloves, or      sets. These sets, composed of two or three cloves each, are      what you then sow. Nitrogen fertilizer is a plus, although      if you have good soil, nothing will be needed.    </p>    <p>      Harvest in midsummer or when the tops ripen, dry, and begin      to fall to the ground. Pull up the whole plant. Let dry      thoroughly, then braid the grass top parts together to form      a long chain. Hang in a dry spot in the kitchen for ready      use.    </p>        <p>      As a perennial, this is another one to plant where it can      grow undisturbed for several years. Although horseradish      will grow anywhere, to produuce good straight roots it      should ha, deep, loose, organic soil, with manure dug down      to a foot. The sets that are sown for horseradish are the      small roots attached to the main one. Lay these      horizontally in a six-inch-dee trench, with the thicker end      of the root four inches highs than the thin end - in other      words, average depth four inches. , You can leave it in the      ground over the winter. In spring, just dig up ins' break      off fresh set,, dig up and break off fresh sets and plant      them. Tastiest in .    </p>        <p>      If you're used to eating iceberg, consider switching. The      loose-headed lettuces such as romane and those in the      butter group are much easier to grow, and, besides, their      green leaves are more nutritious than their blanched white      sour parts. Like most garden vegetables, lettuce prefers      well-drained, rich soil, and, like cucumbers, it needs      plenty of water during the growing season. In fact the two      keys to a good lettuce crop are plenty of water and plenty      of growing space.    </p>    <p>      Thin ruthlessly, for if the lettuce doesn't have the room      to grow quickly, it won't grow at all. Thinned plants when      in the four-leaf stage are reasily transplantable to      another row, so there's no waste involved. This      transplantability makes the crop ideal for starting in      flats before you can work the garden. But remember, lettuce      prefers its weather orbit on the cool side; flats, indoors      or out, should be kept at between 50° and 60° F.    </p>    <p>      Leaf lettuce will refill your salad bowl with fresh-pie      greens many times over if you you harvest only the lower      leaves. The center ones will grow and grow. But pinch the      top off the center ones will grow and grow. But pinch the      top off the center to keep it from flowering.    </p>        <p>      An easy-to-grow crop if, not to sound repetitious, your      soil is fertile and well drained. Can be sown from either      seeds or sets. Sets are a no-muss, no-fuss method, since      you don't have to start them indoors or in cold frames.      Even if you have the space, it's usually better to start      tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, and the like indoors or in the      frames, taking the risk of sowing onion seeds directly into      the ground, even before the last frost. If using sets, they      should be no bigger than half an inch in diameter. Although      logic might dictate the bigger the better, large ones are      more apt to put out seed stalks, making the onion      thick-necked.    </p>    <p>      Set onions are not as good for storage as seed onions, and      young onions shipped up from the South for planting are the      best of all for later storage. The reason young plants are      often bought from the South can be traced to the      light-sensitivity of the onion. While the plant will grow      well enough with less than ten hours of sunlight, most      varieties of onion won't form the onion bulb unless the      plant gets twelve to fourteen hours of daylight. You need      the onion bulb, the plant doesn't. It can always propagate      through seeds. To get onions, it's essential that your      plants be in the bulb-forming stage by early summer.    </p>    <p>      At maturity, when about three-fourths of the leaves have      dropped to the ground, give them a helping hand and knock      down the remaining ones with the backside of a rake. Two      days later, pull the onions to the surface and leave them      there to sun-dry for a couple of days. This will help cure      as well as dry them. Now clip off the old tops to within an      inch of the bulb. Place the onions in a single layer on      open slatted racks indoors or outdoors under a rain cover      of some sort-a porch or even just a sheet of tin will      do. They need continuous air circulation around them. When      the weather stays cool all day long, bag the onions in      netting and hang them in a cool, dry cellar.    </p>        <p>      Plant some of both varieties of parsley, that grown for its      top as well as that, like the Hamburg, whose carrot-shaped      root is a great ingredient in soups and <em>real</em>      stews. Both varieties will survive the winter in the      garden, even in most northern area if well mulched.    </p>    <p>      Parsley seeds germinate unenthusiastically, and it's      suggested they be soaked in tepid water for twenty-four      hours before planting to assist the process. Even so, they      will take a month to germinate. Parsley likes a lot of      nitrogen. Apply some corn: post rich in that element as      side dressing to the plants as they grow.    </p>    <p>      Trim leaf parsley for your table from around the outside of      the plant, leaving the center leaves to mature further.      Root parsley is harvested in fall. It stores well in your      cold cellar.    </p>        <p>      A good crop for the North. Parsnip roots may be left in the      ground through the whole winter and harvested as needed.    </p>    <p>      Freezing improves flavor. Soak seeds like parsley; plant in      well-drained, light, loosesoil that has been richly      composted. The parsnip root goe down a foot and a half, so      make sure the ground is loose t, that depth. Mulch over the      planting to keep it cool and moist until the first shoots      break ground, then clear enough space for them to reach the      sky.    </p>        <p>      Cool weather is a must for peas. This is why early spring      planting is essential. Mulching the young plants throughout      the spring helps keep the soil cooler and gives good      growth.    </p>    <p>      Peas belong to the legume family and make a good rotation      crop for your sweet corn, which is convenient since both      crops do best when not planted to follow themselves in the      same spot. For your peas, manure in the preceding fall if      you can.    </p>    <p>      To give peas a head start in the garden, soak the seeds in      water, half covered, until they sprout. It will take them a      few days, but when they do sprout, they grow quickly, so      plant immediately. Fertilize the plants well when they are      one and a half inches tall.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to grow some edible pod varieties, the kind you      usually get in the city only in Chinese restaurants as snow      peas. Harvest them just as the seeds begin to form.      Delicious served whole and raw in salads, or barely cooked.    </p>        <p>      Need well-drained soil, but not too much nitrogen. Nitrogen      makes the plant grow well, so well, in fact, it forgets all      about making peppers.    </p>    <p>      Grow peppers at the far end of the garden from the      potatoes, since potato bugs like peppers for a change in      menu. When starting peppers in flats, keep the soil very      moist until the seed germinates. However, once the young      shoots develop, be a little more sparing. They need the      moisture but are also prone to damping off. Make sure      there's no chance of frost before setting them out in your      garden. Mulching is an excellent way to retain ground      moisture. But, as with tomatoes, wait till after the first      month's growth to mulch, or the ground will also retain the      cold, which makes the plants fruit later.    </p>    <p>      Harvest the fruit by cutting the stem one inch above it. Do      not twist loose. Sweet peppers are usually picked green for      shipping. On the farm, picking them when fully ripe and      reddish adds flavor. Hot varieties such as cayenne and      tabasco must be picked red.    </p>        <p>      Sandy loam <em>not</em> too rich in organic matter is      preferred. A good poor-soil crop. Use plants instead of      seed potatoes because unless you're guaranteed the potatoes      haven't been sprayed with a growth inhibitor, you're not      going to get anywhere with them. Also the plants will be      more disease-resistant.    </p>    <p>      They like dry, hot weather. Don't mulch, but cultivate      until the vines get big enough to shade out weeds. Harvest      before the first frost of fall. Dig the potatoes up      carefully. Bruising them will reduce their storage quality.    </p>    <p>      Sweet potatoes must be cured before storing. But curing is      simple enough if you're in the South. just spread them out      on some dry hay on the ground and let them lie in the sun      for the better part of a week. Turn them at least once. In      cooler climes, keep them in a 90 percent humidity      environment at 80° to 90° F. for ten days. Store      them packed lightly in straw, at temperatures not below      50° F., with good ventilation.    </p>        <p>      Potatoes need acid soil, as opposed to most vegetables,      which like things close to neutral. Don't put them in limed      soil, soil that has been manured within a year, or c on      which tomatoes have been grown for the past two years.      Early varieties that get a cool growing start are less      disease-prone. Potash is important, so use compost rich in      it. Let cut seed potatoes dry for twenty-four hours before      planting. Make sure each piece contains at least one eye      for a sprout. Mulch potatoes with hay to one foot after      planting; this will keep the soil cool for healthier      growth.    </p>        <p>      Potato Plant    </p>    <p>      1.Flower (Berry poisonous)<br />      2.

Of course      don't forget to harvest small new potatoes early; there's      nothing like them. Cure storage potatoes like sweet      potatoes. M.,. certain they are dry before putting them      away in a cool, dark place for the winter.    </p>        <p>      Pumpkins are often sown in rows between corn plants, as a      double crop. The corn matures first and is harvested,      leaving the field to the pumpkins.    </p>    <p>      Sandy loam is the preferred soil, although, again, this      crop will grow in any well-drained, fertile soil that does      not pack tightly. Usually planted six to a hill, with the      weakest three or four seedlings being pulled as the plants      begin to vine. It's a good idea to cover the hill and      seedlings with a wooden or metal frame hung with      cheesecloth to keep striped beetles away from the young,      tender plants. The veil is removed, of course, once the      young plants begin to outgrow it.    </p>    <p>      If the vines seem to grow on endlessly with no flowers in      sight, pinch back the tips of the vines. They'll take the      hint. In the cool weather of fall, before the frost is on      the pumpkin, cut the fruit from the vine, leaving several      inches of stem. Let them field-cure for ten davs and      they're ready to be stored in your cellar till the big      pumpkin-pie bake.    </p>        <p>      Radishes will likely be your first crop, simply because you      can sow them early and they'll go from seed to picking in      just about a month. The red ones are faster-maturing than      the white, but the white are larger and more flavorsome.      Loose organic soil will give you better, bigger roots.      Don't plant spring varieties in the summer; they will yield      poorly go to seed. Other than that, the crop is about as      easy to grow as they come, and the only care it needs is      occasional thinning, which is accomplished by harvesting.      Sow some more radish every week for a continuous supply.    </p>    <p>      A frequently used trick is to mix radish seeds with beets,      carrots, or other slow-germinating seeds. The emerging      radishes indicate where the other crop will eventually come      up , you don't hoe it away if you weed. At the same time,      you get a bonus crop without extra ground preparation or      seeding pulling the quickmaturing radishes before the      others begin their main growth .    </p>        <p>      Rhubarb us a very healthy crop. particularly in northern      countries where its vitamin C can be put to good use in the      absence of citrus fruits. It can also be a deadly crop,      however. Do not eat rhubarb leaves, nor feed them to your      livestock. They contain large quantities of calcium      oxalate, which is poisonons. Throw the leaves on your      compost pile.    </p>    <p>      Rhubarb is another crop to plant off by itself where you      and the chickens will leave it alone, not only to prevent      leaf-nibbling, but because the plants will keep sprouting      for years. Initial propagation by rootstock rather than      seed is much preferred. Needs heavily fertilized, moist      soil. Cool to cold winters suit the plant, although it      should, under these circumstances be mulched to a depth of      four inches. Livestock bedding makes an excellent mulch,      since the plant will use the manure. You can speed up      spring growth by putting eighteen-inch-square open-top      boxes around the plants so they have to grow tall quickly.      Cut off any flowering stems that develop, as they decrease      the yield of edible stems.    </p>    <p>      Six- or seven-year-old plants will have enlarged roots.      This is the time to retrench your rhubarb bed. Dig up those      plants that have given you the tastiest, most colorful      stems. Cut the roots into five to eight sections, making      sure that at least one bud remains on each root section.      Plant the way you started out.    </p>        <p>      An excellent storage crop. You'll want to grow enough not      only for your own larder, but for your livestock's winter      supply as well. Requires deep, moist, fertile soil, and      prefers it cool, so it's usually sown as a fall crop.    </p>    <p>      If you're using rutabaga for stock feed, sow theirs a      little earlier to increase the root size. It won't be quite      as tasty, but still quite nutritious and satisfactory.    </p>        <p>      Extra moisture and nitrogen-rich compost during the early      stages of growth encourage an abundance of leaves. Keep      sowing at two-week intervals even into the fall. Half-grown      spinach is mulched heavily - up to a foot, depending on how      far north you are. Remove the mulch in spring for early      harvest.    </p>    <p>      For late planting, switch to a yellow disease-resistant      variety such as Virginia Savoy. For areas with hot summers,      plant New Zealand, which is not a true spinach but takes      the heat better and cooks up just the same-if you      must have your spinach cooked in spite of the crisp,      colorful, vitaminrich touch it adds to a garden salad.    </p>        <p>      Plant like pumpkins, using extra manure in the hills.      Winter squash-you can't store summer      squash-must be harvested before frost. If you are      growing gourd squash as well, let a few of the smaller ones      dry out by cutting a hole in one side and setting them by      your stove or fireplace. When thoroughly dried, shake out      the seeds, and hang the gourds up by their stems from a      tree branch, using short strings so they won't swing too      much, or nail them to a tree. Make fine guest-houses for      the bug-eating wrensized birds that might visit your      spread.    </p>        <p>      Flat-raised seedlings should be transplanted after they      have developed three or four true leaves. Separate seedling      containers are preferable, although seeds sprouted together      can always be spaced out later in a fresh flat if      necessary. Water the flats from the bottom by setting them      in water for three to four minutes. Keeping the surface of      the soil dry will minimize damping off in the young plants.    </p>    <p>      Fertile, well-drained soil with plenty of organic material      is needed by tomato plants. For very heavy clay soils, add      sand. The more sun the better. Tomatoes also need good air      circulation around them. Mulch is excellent, but wait till      the plants have a good sturdy start or the mulch, retaining      cold as well as moisture, will stunt their fruiting. Pest      control is more important for tomatoes than for almost any      other of your garden crops, since everybody likes to eat      tomatoes. And, unlike your other plants, tomatoes should be      set one to three inches deeper when transplanted into the      garden. New roots will grow on the buried stems, boosting      the yield.    </p>    <p>      Tomato plants bear so heavily that you will have to stake      them. If not supported, they will bear less, and the      smaller fruit will often spoil. Allow only one main stalk      to keep growing on staked plants. Snap off all others while      still small. Green tomatoes on the vine by fall should be      picked just before the first killing frost, either for      pickling or for keeping on a warm sunny windowsill to      ripen.    </p>        <p>      Grow the same way you do your rutabaga. Again, plant some      extra for your livestock. Turnips make good storage fodder      for the winter.    </p>    <p>      ll-drained, sanloam with plenty of organic matter is the      soil for watermelons. Mulch heavily, but make sure the      ground is good and warm before you o. Watermelons grow like      cucumbers. They're first cousins. They need water and      plenty of hot sun. Pick when vine-ripened, and for best      flavor, early in the morning when the night as cooled the      melons.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        At last! For the first time since the HAVE-MORE Plan was        published way back in the 1940's, a fellow named Richard        W. Langer has come up with a 365-page book that really        introduces a beginner to small-scale farming. Wanna raise        your own fruit, nuts, berries, vegetables, grain,        chickens, pigs, ducks, geese and honeybees? GROW IT!        tells you how to get started, we like it, and here's        another chapter from the book.      </p>      <div class="image">        <img src="../images/021-033-01a.gif" alt="021-033-01a.gif" width="227" height="272" />      </div>      <p>        Special Note: Grow It! Is a big book and even if a chink        this size were to be run in issue after issue of MOTHER,        it would take over two years to put the complete volume        in your hands. If you haven't got two years to play        around with, we recommend that you truck on down to your        nearest book store and shell out $8.95 for your very own        copy of GROW IT! That way, Richard Langer will be happy,        Saturday Review press will be happy... and we're betting        that you'll be happy too. It's a darn good book.      </p>      <p>        EXTRA SPECIAL NOTE: All material here reprinted from GROW        IT! Copyright © 1972 by Richard W. Langer.      </p>      <h3>        GATHERING YOUR OWN SEED      </h3>      <p>        Hybrid plants often do not breed true from seed. But with        but non-hybrid plants, instead of buying seeds every        year, collect and save seeds from the best vegetables        you've grown in your garden to plant. You may well        develop a breed particularly suited to your region.        Sometimes you'll have to buy seeds the second year, even        if you decide to grow your own, simply because your        plants won't produce seed till their second year. But be        patient.      </p>      <p>        Always pick the best overall plants as your seeders. With        crops such as spinach or leaf lettuce, where it's the        leaves you want to harvest, select a plant that takes a        long time to go to seed. With root crops such as radishes        and carrots, use those plants that go to seed first,        since this will mean earlier roots in your new plants.        Here are some of the easier seeds to collect.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Beets.</strong>      </p>      <p>        If your winters are mild, beets can be left out in the        garden. If not, store the best roots, set in sand, in a        cold, damp spot. Come spring, replant the beets, and when        the seed stalk develops, tie it to a stick to keep it        from breaking off. Cover with cheesecloth as it matures;        birds just love beet seeds. Once the stalk is mature,        break off and hang it indoors with your onions. Remove        the seeds when dry. With luck, you'll have seeds in time        for a late crop the same year. In any case, yo have        plenty for the following year. Store in dry glass jar.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Cabbage.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Cross-pollinates readily. If you want seeds to be true,        grow only one species. Store the firmest, largest heads        in individual baskets of soil in a root cellar or other        cold spot over the winter. Handle as you do the beets.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Carrots.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Same as beets, but don't try replanting if there are        plenty of wild carrots in your region ot you'll end up        with worthless half-breeds.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Cucumbers.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Let them vine-ripen to yellow-orange, even slightly        mushy. Remove seeds, wash, and let them sit in shallow        dishes of water to ferment for two days. Wash them again,        pat dry in an old towel, and dry further by layering        between sheets of newspaper. When absolutely dry, store        them it tight glass container in a dry corner of the        cupboard. Chi, once a month or so to make sure no mold        has started      </p>      <p>        <strong>Lettuce.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Same as cabbage, except the flower stalk develops in the        fall of the first year so you don't have to plant the        head in the spring.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Peas.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Leave on the vine till the leaves turn color and being to        die. Pick the pods and shell the peas. Dry them further        between newspapers in a dark spot free of any dampness.        Watch for mold. Store in dry glass jars.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Potatoes.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Pick your plumpest, best-shaped, scab-free ones. Store        whole, buried in dry sand in your cold cellar. For        planting, cut into seeds, each with an eye or two.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Radishes.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Same as lettuce.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Rutabagas.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Mulch heavily over the winter. Uncover early in spring        and collect seeds as with beets. Rutabagas are hardy        enough so that you don't have to transplant them if well        mulched.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Tomatoes.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Same as cucumbers.      </p>      <p>        <strong>Turnips.</strong>      </p>      <p>        Same as rutabagas.<br />        There's no mystery in gathering your own seed except for        the mystery of nature. And it is truly the way to        self-sufficiency and a better farm.      </p>    </div>
