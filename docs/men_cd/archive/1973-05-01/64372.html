                    <h5 id="byline">      by H.C Mathews    </h5>              <p>      Our first warning of the invasion came on a warm, clear      morning about the middle of May. My wife and I noticed a      dozen or more honeybees flying close to the front of our      home where the porch roof is attached . . . then a long      spell of cool, wet weather set in and we didn't see the      insects for a week. I was busy with other matters and      thought little of it . . . until the sun came out again and      our visitors returned.    </p>    <p>      "Ethel," I said, "somebody's bees are getting ready to      swarm. I'd better prepare the catch-hive, because if those      scouts have found a hole or a crack in the siding of this      old house they'll bring back the whole bunch and set up      housekeeping."    </p>    <p>      Accordingly, I got out the homemade half-size hive with      which I catch swarms and raise queens. I placed an old,      strong-smelling brood comb in the hive, along with another      comb that contained a royal cell nearly ready to hatch.      (I'd anticipated the swarming season by arranging for some      of my bees to start this queen more than a week beforehand,      just in case I should need her.)    </p>    <p>      I then prepared to get the hive up on the porch roof next      to where the migrating scouts were buzzing around. I also      figured I'd better plug any small holes in the house's      siding where bees might get into the wall. Too late! As I      collected my tools, Ethel came running to the workshop with      the cry, "The swarm is here!"    </p>    <p>      Sure enough, bees were already creeping through an opening      at the end of the weatherboarding next to the cornice. I      clambered up near them and put the catch-hive on the porch      roof, but-due to the overhang of the molding-I      could get it no closer than about 20 inches to their point      of entry. That wasn't close enough and the bees continued      to make their way in under the siding instead of into the      hive.    </p>    <p>      "Well," I thought, "I can still put at least part of the      swarm where I want it." Masses of eager insects were      clustered around the hole in the wall awaiting their turn      to enter, and-since bees that have just swarmed are      full of honey and don't usually sting-I scooped up      several double handfuls and dumped them in front of my      catch-box. They smelled the combs inside and readily      crawled in . . . but I was still left with the problem of      capturing the bees that were already inside the wall of the      house.    </p>    <p>      If I had only succeeded in plugging the chink and setting      up the catch-hive before the swarm arrived-as I'd      planned-all the new arrivals would have gone into      their own house instead of into mine. Then I could have      closed the entrance and moved the hive to a permanent      location near my other bees. The following morning      newcomers would have flown out, circled around a bit to      note their new surroundings, and found their way home from      foraging thereafter without any trouble. As it was,      however, some of the swarm were settled with their queen in      the hollow wall and cornice of my home, and showed no signs      of leaving.    </p>    <p>      To get the squatters out, I covered the opening where they      entered with a bee escape . . . a metal device with weak      brass springs so arranged that a bee can push its way      through in one direction only. I also noticed a small crack      in the cornice, not quite big enough for the insects to get      through. When I looked in I could see jointed legs working      as the resourceful creatures searched for other crevices by      which they might come and go, so I bored a hole next to      this gap and put another escape over it.    </p>    <p>      Soon worker bees began to find their way through the      hatches and fly off to the fields and woods. On their      return, however, they discovered that they couldn't get      back in to deposit their loads of nectar and pollen in the      combs their fellows were busily building to receive the      golden harvest. It was interesting to see the returning      workers' distressed behavior as they ran about looking for      some way to get past the gates that had let them leave, but      wouldn't allow them to re-enter. Interestingly enough,      though the catch-hive was only 20 inches away, none of the      returnees would go in. Instead, they clustered in      bewilderment around the escapes fastened to the siding and      cornice.    </p>            <p>      What should I do? To get the box any closer I'd have to      build a scaffold to support it, and I didn't care to so      deface the front of our house. I went to sleep thinking      about the problem, and awoke during the night as a possible      solution came to mind I'd nail together four wooden strips      and make a tunnel to lead from the escapes to the hive!    </p>    <p>      This I did the following morning, and as soon as I put my      invention in place, the bees began to enter their new home.      Soon, in fact, there was a mad scramble for the opening.    </p>    <p>      The success of my tunnel device was, I think, due to the      work of the farmers. These are members of a colony whose      job is to hang by their feet and buzz their wings so that      the air currents thus set in motion will carry excess heat      and moisture from inside the hive. (Who invented air      conditioning, anyhow?) In this case the discharge of stale      air went out of the half-hive's entrance and up the tunnel.      As the workers clustered around the escapes smelled the      familiar odor of those old combs and the bees already in      the box, their reaction apparently was, "Ah-h! This      is what we've been looking for." And in they rushed.    </p>    <p>      After two days nearly all the insects had abandoned the      wall of the house and left the queen and her attendants      behind. Unfortunately, the castaways would soon starve      without the workers to bring them food . . . but there was      no help for it. Very few bees were seen trying to get back      through the escapes, and those that had made themselves at      home in the hive were going and coming in a normal manner.    </p>    <p>      Since almost the whole swarm was now contained in a box      only half the usual size, I became concerned about      ventilation and tacked a piece of screen wire on top of the      hive. At night    </p>    <p>      I placed a folded newspaper over this grille, and laid the      wooden cover over all as protection from the cool night air      and possible rain.    </p>    <p>      A few days later, when I had captured all the swarm I      could, I thought it was time to move the newcomers to their      permanent location. After sunset, when darkness had forced      the workers to quit their field work, I blew a little smoke      into the entrance of the temporary home to drive back the      guards posted there. (These officials keep out any would-be      intruders, such as robbers from other hives.) Then I tacked      a piece of screen wire over the door, and my      helper-Tommy Harvey-brought the catching device      down from the roof and placed the box near my other      colonies.    </p>    <p>      Now there was another problem. If I simply opened the      entrance, the workers would fly out to forage the next      morning and-instead of coming back to the      hive-would return to the porch roof location . . .      where they'd find no place to go. The only solution other      than moving them at least a mile away was to keep them shut      up for three days. By that time, the old spot would be      forgotten.    </p>    <p>      By now the weather had turned quite warm, and the swarm      needed more space during its confinement. I therefore put a      screen top on an empty standard-size hive body and covered      half its bottom with a piece of light board (so that the      remaining opening was only as wide as the top of the      catch-hive). Then I puffed a little smoke through the      screen lid of the smaller box (to discourage flight),      pulled the cover off the halfhive and quickly placed the      larger container on top.    </p>    <p>      Each morning and evening I sprinkled half a pint of thin      sugar syrup through the wire cover. This food-one      part granulated sugar to two parts water-was a poor      substitute for the real thing, but at least it kept the      captives from starving.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately the members of the other nearby hives were so      busy working that the imitation nectar didn't attract them.      Had the weather turned cool and cloudy, they might have      licked off as much as they could of the syrup that stuck to      the top of the screen . . . and then scouted around to find      out what other easily gathered booty was available. When      bees find a weak, poorly guarded colony they'll rob it of      its treasures and kill the inhabitants. Sounds almost      human, doesn't it?    </p>    <p>      The night before I released my prisoners from their house      arrest, I broke off an armful of small leafy branches and      placed them in front of the hive to force the bees to note      their changed location. Then I reached through this foliage      and pulled the screen from the entrance.<br />      <br />      Early the next morning-when I went to see what was      going on-bees were finding their way through the      barrier, becoming airborne and circling about. Sometimes      they flew back toward the hive several times as if to be      sure of finding their way home before taking off in search      of nature's sweets. Later in the day I found that a few had      returned to the roof, but they soon disappeared. The brush      had served its purpose, and during the afternoon I removed      it from in front of the colony's new location.    </p>    <p>      The following day I shifted the catch-hive to one side, and      prepared to move the bees permanently into the empty      standard-size hive I'd used for a space extender.    </p>    <p>      First I placed eight frames of old combs-and the two      I'd already given the colony-into the larger      container, set it on a full-size bottom board and topped it      with a cover. (See MOTHER NO. 12, pg. 41, for a diagram of      a modern hive.-MOTHER.) Then I laid an old piece of      cotton sheet about three feet square on the ground in front      of the new home, with one edge extending into the hive      entrance, and shook the bees still in the small box onto      this cloth. They began at once to crawl into their fresh      quarters. Several days later I checked and found that the      new queen had hatched, flown out to mate with a drone in      the air and started to lay eggs.    </p>    <p>      Soon I'll add another full-size hive body with frames of      what is known as "foundation"-thin sheets of wax with      the bases of worker cells stamped on both sides-to      the first to make sure the bees build the kind of combs I      want where I want them. If the weather continues favorable      after this second chamber is filled with honey, pollen and      young bees . . . I'll give the colony a super (additional      section of hive) or two in which to store honey for us.      After all, tenants in a modern home should pay reasonable      rent.    </p>
