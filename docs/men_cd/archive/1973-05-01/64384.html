                    <div class="sidebar">    <p>      Back in 1949-before factory farming and the "pump 'em      full of chemicals" school of agriculture blitzed the      country-a fellow named Jack Widmer wrote a little      book called <em>PRACTICAL ANIMAL HUSBANDRY.</em> Now that      manual wasn't what you'd call completely exhaustive, the      writing style wasn't the best and a few of the ideas it      advanced-such as confining laying hens in      cages-were later refined into the kind of automated      farming that so many of us are fighting against these days.    </p>    <p>      Still, <em>PRACTICAL ANIMAL HUSBANDRY</em> contained a good      deal of basic information that today's "homesteaders" all      too often need pleased, then, that the publis and don't      know where to find. I'mher of the book, Charles Scribner's      Sons, has granted me permission to reprint excerpts from      this outof-print manual. I think that many of my readers      will find the following information both interesting and      informative. -MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Excerpts from <em>PRACTICAL ANIMAL HUSBANDRY</em> by Jack      Widmer are reprinted by permission of Charles Scribner's      Sons. Copyright 1949 by Charles Scribner's Sons.    </p>    </div>    <p>      Advances made by the veterinary profession in recent years      have completely changed the entire picture of turkey      production. As short a time as 15 years ago, the rearing of      turkeys was considered one of the most hazardous of      agricultural pursuits and many experienced turkey breeders      lost upwards of 75% of their entire flocks to disease in a      single year. Here then certainly was no place for the      amateur, for if the experienced, full-time farmer was often      unsuccessful with turkeys, what chance did the average      country dweller have with his small flock?    </p>    <p>      Today, thanks to unrelenting research conducted by the      United States Department of Agriculture, various State      Experiment Stations and some commercial breeders, many of      the hazards of turkey production have been eliminated and      there is now no reason why the amateur, using reasonable      intelligence and possessing the willingness to follow      simple directions cannot produce at least enough turkeys      for his own table, at small expense and with low death      loss.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Harvey Griffin, owner of the Wagonwheel Ranch of      California, and one of the foremost breeders of      Broad-Breasted Bronze turkeys states that at least half of      his expense in raising turkeys is labor costs and he      further contends that if the amateur is willing to do his      own work, he may produce turkeys considerably cheaper than      can the commercial breeder. In addition, turkeys are      handsome birds, and even though they are not as easy to      grow as are chickens, they do not require expensive housing      facilities and grow from infancy to maturity in less than      six months.    </p>    <p>      We here on Toowoomba usually purchase a dozen poults (baby      turkeys) each year, and have had very good results. True,      there have been years when we have lost as many as four of      the dozen . . . however, these have usually died in the      very early stages before they have consumed very much      expensive feed.    </p>        <h3>TURKEY BREEDS</h3>    <p>      The prospective turkey raiser will have his choice of six      major breeds. They are the Bronze, White Holland, Bourbon      Red, Narragansett, Black and Slate. Choice will depend on      what varieties of poults are available, the size of the      finished carcass desired and personal preference concerning      color. All breeds do well when produced on a small scale .      . . however, if the fancier wished to butcher birds at a      maximum of 25 pounds, he may select the Broad-Breasted      Bronze. If, on the other hand, he prefers a bird that will      dress out in the neighborhood of 20 pounds, he may select      any of the other four breeds. The Broad-Breasted Bronze is      an improved variety of the Bronze breed developed on the      Pacific Coast: its distinguishing feature being that it      produces more white meat per pound of dress weight than any      of the other breeds. In the past few years this has become      the most popular of all breeds and the beginner may very      well start with these magnificent birds for they are hardy,      do well on both range and in close confinement, and      certainly present a handsome carcass. If on the other hand,      unplucked pinfeathers that do not show are of importance      (as they are in the kitchen of Toowoomba) then the choice      may be the White Holland.    </p>    <h3>STARTING WITH TURKEYS</h3>    <p>      Although the rearing of turkeys is much different from the      rearing of chickens, the general principles of starting are      the same. As with chickens, there are three major      beginnings: [1] day-old poults, [2] "started" poults . . .      six to eight weeks or older and [3] home-grown poults. This      choice is up to the breeder, but unlike chickens, the      beginner will find it much more difficult and considerably      more expensive to produce home-grown poults than it was to      produce home-grown chicks. It goes without saying that      breeding turkeys will consume more feed than will the same      number of breeding chickens (a full-grown tom will consume      over 200 pounds of feed in a single year) and it is      therefore not practical to keep breeding stock unless a      minimum of 15 hens is maintained, or if the fancier is      interested in producing "show stock" thus making the      economical production of poults a secondary matter.    </p>    <h3>DAY-OLD POULTS</h3>    <p>      Assuming that the selection of breed has been determined,      and again assuming that the beginner has contacted a      reputable hatchery that produces a good strain of turkeys,      then we are ready to start with our flock. First off, it      might be wise to issue a word of warning as to how many      poults to order. If we are not interested in the commercial      side of turkey production (and we should not be unless we      have had considerable experience in their rearing) it is      not wise to purchase more than a dozen poults. A dozen      mature turkeys will produce over 250 pounds of turkey meat      which is considerably more than the average family can      consume during the year regardless of how much help they      receive from neighbors and relations. It must also be      remembered that a turkey will eat at least 100 pounds of      feed during his six months' residence on the farm which if      multiplied by too large a factor soon becomes an expensive      outlay. It might also be wise to note that a mere dozen      poults do not require extensive housing, and brooding      arrangements whereas many more than that number will      require considerable construction for their maintenance.    </p>    <p>      Great care should be exercised so that one will purchase      poults from a "pullorum free" flock, for this disease is      transmitted from turkey hens to poults and can only be      controlled at the source of supply. When the poults arrive      from the hatchery, they may be placed under turkey hens (as      described in the article, "Homestead Chicken Production",      MOTHER NO. 19) or better yet they may be placed in a      factory or homemade brooder and kept at a temperature of      from 95 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit for the first week or ten      days. This temperature is gradually lowered until the      poults are from 8 to 10 weeks of age when they require      little if any heat. Naturally, outside temperature and      humidity, general weather conditions, etc., will be a      deciding factor and the turkey raiser will do well to      control his heating arrangement by watching over the      comfort of his poults rather than any hard and fast      regulations concerning temperature.    </p>    <p>      Sand is considered the ideal litter for starting poults.      This litter should be changed at least once per week and no      substitute for sand should be used for at least the first      three week. After that, wood shavings, clean wheat straw,      peat moss or other litters may be substituted. Some turkey      producers insist that no litter should be used; instead      they maintain their poults on fine wire screen, contending      that young gobblers are kept cleaner on wire than on litter      and that if these wire screens are kept at least three      inches above the floor level, then cleaning is no problem.    </p>    <p>      Yet regardless of what method is used, the beginner will      experience considerable aggravation with the young birds      when he attempts to feed them for the first time. Young      poults will walk over feed dishes without seeing them and      many breeders experience difficulty in teaching the poults      to eat. Some recommend that all poults must have their      beaks dipped into feed several times during the first day;      others contend that feed should be kept on boards directly      under the brooder and that the birds will eventually learn      to eat. No matter which method is employed, it is      recommended that young poults be watched closely so that      the breeder knows that they have started to eat. After the      first day or two they may be fed in any convenient type of      chicken feeder and water is supplied in glass drinking      containers.    </p>    <p>      Turkeys usually stay in the brooder house (or in batteries      if they are used) for the duration of the brooding period.      Then, having reached six weeks, they are placed on the sun      porch. Some breeders contend that they should have access      to the porch before that time (and are therefore given      roosts to use before the age of six weeks has been reached)      . . . however, that is a question that must be settled by      local climatic conditions, time of year, etc. We here on      Toowoomba have always maintained our poults indoors for the      first six weeks with considerable success.    </p>    <h3>"STARTED" POULTS</h3>    <p>      As in the case of chickens, turkey poults may be purchased      that have attained the age of from six to eight weeks.      Naturally, these poults are considerably more expensive      than the dayold poults and there is little to be gained by      their purchase except that the turkey producer is relieved      of the responsibility of maintaining a brooder for he takes      delivery of the poults at an age when heat is no longer      necessary. Feeding of these "started" poults is of course      the same as that of day-old birds once the sixth to eighth      week has been passed.    </p>    <h3>HOME-GROWN POULTS</h3>    <p>      We have previously stated that the beginner will find it      unwise to attempt to produce his own poults unless he has      had considerable experience with turkeys. Whereas the      purchase of young gobblers together with their fattening is      roughly a six-month program, the maintenance of a breeding      flock is a year-around proposition and is not practical for      the average beginner. Of course, if you are of an      inquisitive nature (as are the Widmers) you will want to      raise your own turkeys. There is no reason why you      shouldn't and more power to you.    </p>        <p>      First, let us assume that the desired breed has been      selected and that we are prepared either to purchase      breeding stock, or as in the case of Toowoomba, the better      females from the originally purchased poults have been      saved. Then we are ready to get into business. If      home-grown turkey hens are kept, it would be advisable to      purchase a tom from an unrelated strain.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, the most satisfactory time to select breeding      birds is before Thanksgiving so that those good enough      either to save or purchase are obtainable before the      holiday axe falls. The breeders should have compact, meaty      bodies, with straight breasts and broad backs. They should      be vigorous and by all means they should have originated in      a purebred flock and one free from pullorum.    </p>    <p>      In mating it should be remembered that one mature male will      handle from 15 to 18 hens, and the best age for these      breeders is two years old even though yearlings may be used      in a limited capacity.    </p>    <p>      Ten days after mating it may be assumed that eggs are      fertile and these may be saved as "hatchers". Each four      hens should be provided with a nest, and eggs should be      gathered at least twice daily . . . more often during warm      weather. The average hen will produce 35 eggs each season      before becoming broody, and if artificial lights are used      and if hens are "broken up" when they try to set, this      figure may easily be increased to 60 eggs.    </p>    <p>      Eggs should be stored at a temperature no higher than 60      degrees Fahrenheit and should not be held longer than ten      days between laying and setting. As to rations, laying      turkeys should be fed a combination of mash and scratch,      and of course salt and oystershell should be available at      all times. Excellent commercial turkey feed mixtures may be      purchased and for those producing a limited number of birds      annually this is the answer to the feed question. However,      for those who are interested in mixing their own feeds or      at least knowing what should be included in an ideal      mixture, we think it wise to include many mash mixtures      that have been found satisfactory. An excellent laying mash      and scratch is as follows:    </p>	    <p>      During the laying season mash should be kept before the      hens at all times, the scratch being hand-fed twice daily      and given at the rate of about 1/4 pound per hen per day.    </p>    <p>      Turkey hens make good incubators and the average turkey hen      will cover from 15 to 18 eggs, the chicken hen (of the      medium-weight breeds) from 7 to 10 eggs. Either have proven      satisfactory, yet if eggs are to be artificially incubated      then it is advisable to take them to a commercial hatchery      and have the eggs custom incubated . . . usually at a very      small cost.    </p>    <p>      Turkey eggs incubate in 28 days and the method of handling      both hen and poults is much the same as described in the      article, "Homestead Chicken Production", in MOTHER NO. 19.      In the event that an artificial brooder is to be used then      we refer the reader back to the "Day-old Chick" section of      that article.    </p>    <h3>RAISING TURKEYS ON WIRE</h3>    <p>      As with chickens there are two major methods of raising      turkeys: [1] range production and [ 2] raising turkeys on      wire. Concerning chickens, we are willing to give the      beginner the choice of either method. However, in the case      of turkeys, we strongly advise all beginners to stay with      the wire or sun-porch method.    </p>    <p>      As in the case of chickens, it is probably true that      turkeys confined to wire enclosures consume more feed than      those who have unrestricted range, yet the advantages from      a sanitary standpoint of the sun porch should be the      deciding factor for the beginner, regardless of how much      range he may have available.    </p>    <p>      Turkeys require a minimum of five square feet of floor      space per bird when the sun-porch method is used. There is      no necessity for these sunning areas to be constructed on      an elaborate scale for many small-scale turkey producers      have had excellent luck with homemade and makeshift rigs.      It is merely a chicken-wire cage large enough to allow the      five square feet of floor space required for each bird and      is usually constructed so that the birds have      headroom-3 feet 6 inches is sufficient-and      containing enough roosts so that all birds may perch      simultaneously. The floor may be constructed either of wire      or wooden slats and the entire contraption is built some      three feet above the ground so that droppings may be easily      raked out from under the porch and placed in the compost      pile. About 20% of the sun porch should be covered with      some sort of roofing material so that the birds will have      ample shade during hot summer days and also supply a cover      so that they may get out of driving rains. The sunning area      should be constructed so that all feed and watering troughs      may be reached from the outside, thus eliminating the      spread of contagious disease by the attendant walking from      one pen to the other.    </p>    <p>      Turkeys are placed on this sun porch as poults directly      from the brooder room and are kept there for their entire      stay on the farm. Of course porches of any size may be      constructed and more and more commercial producers are      going from the range to the sun-porch method of rearing      turkeys. Should the breeder raise more than 100 birds      annually, it is advisable to have more than one sunning      area (or at least to supply partitions in large sun      porches) so that not more than 100 birds are kept together.      This will eliminate danger from piling up and overcrowding.    </p>    <p>      In the range method, great care must be exercised so that      disease is not spread through soil contamination. Under no      circumstances should turkeys be permitted to run on ground      that has previously been occupied by chickens, and pastures      or ranges must be changed continually if the birds are to      remain healthy. These pastures should be changed at least      every ten days (if they are small) for once disease strikes      control is most difficult and sometimes utterly impossible.    </p>        <h3>FEEDING TURKEYS</h3>    <p>      Even though turkeys are very particular in their eating      habits, properly fed young birds make astounding gains. For      those interested in a very limited number of birds it would      not be practical to mix and grind starter mash for there      are any number of commercial products that have proven very      satisfactory. However, for those who like to mix their own      feeds, and for those who wish to compare the contents of      commercial mash against that of ideal composition, the      following mixtures may prove of interest.    </p>		    <p>      In the event that liquid skim milk is available (and there      is no better feed for young turkeys) the following starting      mash may be used to advantage.    </p>		    <p>      In addition to either of these rations, fine gravel or      coarse sand should be supplied together with green feed if      such feed is available. Tender lettuce, Swiss chard, short      lawn clippings or tender alfalfa are all excellent. Yet the      beginner must be warned not to feed tough greens for these      often cause impaction in young birds which sometimes proves      fatal.    </p>    <p>      By the time poults have reached six to eight weeks of age      and are confined to the sun porch, they may be switched to      a ration made up as follows:    </p>        <p>      Commercial feed manufacturers also make excellent mashes      that may be fed after poults have reached six to eight      weeks, yet regardless of whether mash is purchased or home      mixed, a grain ration is also fed at this point. Turkeys do      extremely well on corn, whole oats, barley or whole-wheat,      and this grain is fed in unlimited amounts . . . the young      gobblers are given access to all the grain they will      consume together with the recommended mash. As the turkeys      grow older, usually by the time they have reached 16 to 17      weeks, they will start increasing their consumption of      whole grains and will voluntarily cut down on the      percentage of mash consumed. This is natural and need not      concern the producer. This is especially true as cool      weather moves in and some breeders stop feeding mash      altogether at this juncture. Here on Toowoomba, however, we      have found that it pays to keep mash before the birds      regardless of how little they will eat for they receive      food values from mash that is not always present in whole      grains. <strong>SANITATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Turkeys are the most sensitive of all the members of the      home barnyard concerning sanitary conditions, and success      or failure with turkeys is often in direct relationship to      sanitary living and feeding arrangements. If      "pullorum-clean" poults have been purchased, there is      little danger from this disease. However, there are many      diseases that must be controlled if one is to be      successful. Coccidiosis has been a troublemaker for turkey      breeders for generations and is best combated by      maintaining strict sanitation in the brooder house. Litter      must be kept dry and changed at least once each week, and      feeders and water containers must be kept sterile.      Clabbered skim milk has been found to be an excellent      preventative for coccidiosis, yet if sour milk is fed,      feeders must be sterilized daily so that the leavings from      this milk will not remain in the troughs, thus spreading      disease.    </p>        <p>      Blackhead is perhaps the most dangerous of the long list of      turkey diseases. This sickness, which causes a black      appearance of the head as the name implies, is often      carried by chickens although they do not always show      symptoms of the disease. It is for this reason that many      contend that turkeys and chickens should never be produced      on the same farm . . . however, if care is taken there is      no logical reason why turkeys and chickens cannot be      produced on the same property. Of course, it goes without      saying that these two birds should never be permit ted to      run together, that turkeys never be permitted to range on      land that has previously ranged chickens and that the      turkey fancier never walk from his chicken pen into turkey      pens without first slipping on a pair of rubbers that are      kept for that purpose. This is the great advantage of the      sun-porch method of turkey raising, for if this porch is      constructed so that the birds may be fed from the outside,      then there is no necessity for the breeder to walk into the      turkey pen... thus eliminating all chance of blackhead      contamination.    </p>        <p>      <strong>THE FINISHED PRODUCT</strong> Turkeys are usually      fed so that that they will reach their maximum weight      during the Thanksgiving and Christmas season and the entire      flock (less those that we may wish to keep for breeding      stock) should be butchered at that time. Feed costs mount      steadily as the turkeys grow to maturity and there little      to be gained by keeping the birds after they have reached      their prime.    </p>    <p>      Turkeys freeze very well and may be stored from eight to      ten months at zero degrees Fahrenheit without losing any of      their original quality, especially if packed in cellophane      bags. Turkeys may be stuffed before freezing if this is      desired and are thus ready for the oven directly after      being taken from the deepfreeze and permitted to thaw.      Turkeys may also be smoked, canned or used as broilers . .      . however, the use of broilers is not economical and few      turkeys are butchered at this early age.    </p>    <p>      Smoking of turkeys is not at all difficult and excellent      results have been obtained by many an amateur. A homemade      smoker may be constructed by anyone handy with tools. The      turkeys should be smoked whole for 20 to 24 hours after      having been soaked in a brine solution for a period of from      9 to 12 days. Oversmoking of turkeys must be avoided for      this darkens the skin too deeply. Also oversmoked turkey      tastes exactly as does ham and therefore the turkey loses      its distinctive flavor.    </p>
