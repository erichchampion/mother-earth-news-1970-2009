                   <h5 id="byline">	by Mike Kiernan</h5>    <p>      When former EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus recently      granted the U.S. auto industry an extra year to meet the      1975 deadline for rigid exhaust-emission standards, he      received the decision-maker's traditional award . . .      severe criticism from all sides.    </p>    <p>      General Motors Chairman Richard Gerstenberg was      "disappointed and dismayed" by Ruckelshaus' interim      national guidelines and special standards for California.      Ralph Nader, meanwhile, called the ruling "capitulation to      the domestic auto industry, plain and simple" because      Ruckelshaus compromised at all.    </p>    <p>      The fact remains that no one knows the best approach to      auto emission controls . . . not EPA, not Detroit, not      Congress, not even Ralph Nader. All the sound and fury from      Detroit has centered on the installation of controversial,      imperfect, delicate devices known as catalytic converters.      Usually made out of costly platinum or palladium, these      gadgets burn up pollutants on their way to the exhaust      pipe. Specifically, the devices are designed either to      oxidize hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide into harmless      water vapor and carbon dioxide, or to reduce nitrogen      oxides into nitrogen and oxygen.    </p>    <p>      Trouble is, these contrivances are complicated and      expensive. A typical Detroit dual-catalyst system      includes-in addition to the converter      itself-[1] an improved carburetor and choke to      provide a better air-fuel mixture; [2] a quick-heat intake      manifold to promote rapid fuel evaporation; [3] an      electronic ignition to eliminate distributor problems, [4]      an exhaust gas recirculation line to send some of the      exhaust back through the engine and [5] an improved air      pump.    </p>    <p>      Even with the one-year extension, Detroit insists it still      must rely on the catalytic converters to do the job of      virtually eliminating dangerous exhaust fumes. The 1970      Clean Air Act calls for carbon monoxides and hydrocarbons      to be reduced 90 percent by model year 1975 and nitrogen      oxides to be cut 90 percent by 1976.    </p>    <p>      On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the automobile lobbyists are      citing Ruckelshaus' one-year extension as reason for      further weakening of the 1970 law. The forced installation      of the converters, says Detroit, will lead to      "environmental overkill". The devices will fall apart on      the assembly line. Plants will close; jobs will be lost.    </p>    <p>      This apocalyptic vision, however, neatly overlooks two      points. First, exhaust emissions are a serious health      hazard and cars are responsible for up to 80 percent of the      air pollution in some cities. Second, meeting the 1970      standards may actually be less difficult than Detroit      contends. After all, three foreign cars-Mazda, Honda and      Mercedes-Benz-already have met the original 1975      standards for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. And they      did it without catalytic converters:    </p>    <p>      <strong>•</strong> Honda uses a stratified-charge      engine. On the top of each cylinder a small additional      combustion chamber is attached into which a rich air-fuel      mixture is fed and ignited. Burning then spreads to the      leaner mixture in the main chamber, combustion is prolonged      and most pollutants are consumed inside the engine.    </p>    <p>      <strong>•</strong> Mazda employs its now well-known      rotary (Wankel) engine with a thermal reactor. Rotaries are      inherently dirtier than standard engines, but they're also      smaller too. This leaves plenty of room under the hood for      a reactor... a kind oven in which exhaust is mixed with air      and burned again at high temperature.    </p>    <p>      <strong>•</strong> The Mercedes-Benz diesel burns fuel      more completely than an "ordinary" powerplant an and      produces very low carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions      (although nitrogen oxides still present a problem still      present a problem).<br />      <br />      Despite these examples, many experts are urging Detroit to      abandon the internal combustion engine entirely and find a      practical, non-polluting substitute. Steam and electric      autos are the objects of considerable research and      promising steam vehicles have been developed . . . but the      electric car still power and battery problems. Gas turbines      and alternate fuels-such as natural gas, propane and      hydrogen-also are receiving attention.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, 40 percent of all American households already      own two or more vehicles and 1973 promises to be the      biggest sales year in Detroit history. Not air pollution,      not traffic snarls, not gas rationing, not even inflation      can keep the age American out of the booming automobile      market.    </p>    <h3>OMB & RECYCLING</h3>   <p>      President Nixon's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has      quietly eliminated an entire division at EPA, apparently      because of its strident efforts to champion "recycling" in      cities and industries.    </p>    <p>      The EPA division, responsible for resource recovery      programs, completed an 80-page report more than a year ago      calling on the Federal Government to give recycling a      chance in the marketplace. Researchers complained that      industries gaging in activities like strip mining, oil      drilling and the cutting of forest enjoy huge tax breaks      that encourage them to exploit more and more irreplaceable      natural resources. In contrast, have not been given      corresponding tax incentives to trash as a fuel supplement      to generate electricity or to recycle waste in any other      way.    </p>    <p>      The EPA researchers also urged that manufacturers taxed for      polluting two "free" resources . . . air and water. The      agency has found that nearly all manufacturing processes us      "virgin" materials pollute more than processes using      recycled materials. If manufacturers were made to pay for      their pollution, reasoned the EPA, then a strong new market      for recycling goods would be stimulated.    </p>    <p>      The Environmental Protection Agency undertook the study      after Congress ordered it to find out how the U.S. could      more effectively use its limited resources . . . but the      completed report sat over at OMB for nearly a year. When      the paper was finally released, EPA's tough talk on      recycling had turned to mush. Since then, the jobs of those      who conducted the study have been eliminated.    </p>
