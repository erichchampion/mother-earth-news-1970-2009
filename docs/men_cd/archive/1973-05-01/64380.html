                   <h3>STUART SILVERSTEIN	 </h3>        <p>      I first learned to tie flies when I was a boy of 13. After      watching a man up the street create beauties with such      magical names as <em>Parmachene Belle, Silver Doctor,      Cowdung, Rio Grande King, March Brown</em> and <em>Black      Ghost,</em> I couldn't wait to make my own attempt at this      old craft. Every Sunday afternoon for several weeks I      carefully observed by mentor in action, then finally took      the plunge and invested $5.00 in a fly-tying kit.    </p>    <p>      The quality of those original supplies was poor, but I      didn't care . . . I only wanted to get my hands on the fur,      bright feathers and glittering tinsels and combine them      into enticements for trout and salmon. When I wasn't      actually in the process of tying a fly or fishing, I would      often sit mesmerized just admiring the raw materials:      raffia grass from Africa, silver and gold tinsels from      France, rabbit skins and glossy rooster plumage, to name a      few.    </p>    <p>      My initial efforts were very sloppily executed, but the      fish didn't seem to notice. With just a little practice I      was soon able to make a few of the simpler trout baits      quite proficiently (and to sell them to local fishermen).    </p>    <p>      At present I tie flies only for myself and for friends who      go trout and salmon fishing here in Maine but, in the near      future, I plan to start selling my creations once again to      earn some extra money. It's an absorbing and profitable      craft at which you might like to try your hand.    </p>    <h3>WHAT IS FLY-TYING?</h3>    <p>      Fly-tying is basically a method of securing various      materials such as furs feathers and tinsels to a fishhook.      The resulting fly may or may not imitate an aquatic      creature which fish feed upon: A Royal Coachman doesn't      look like anything you'll ever see swimming in the water,      whereas Roche's Dragonfly does . . . and they both catch      fish.    </p>    <h3>THE SKILLS YOU'LL NEED</h3>    <p>      Although a hand-tied fly looks like a complicated creation,      it's actually put together in an orderly, step-by-step      process that can be mastered by anyone able to form a knot      in a piece of thread. You needn't even be a flyfisherman,      though it certainly helps.    </p>    <p>      The best fly-tier I know-and one of the most      outstanding in the United States-is Lou Stanford of      New Haven, Connecticut. Lou is a massive, 300-pound      construction worker with fingers as thick as the pipes he      welds on the job . . . but he can produce the most      delicate, aesthetically pleasing baits any fisherman could      hope to own.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO LEARN</h3>    <p>      The best way to learn to tie flies is to have a master of      the craft teach you. Such people flourish wherever trout or      salmon are caught, and can be found even in cities like      Chicago, San Francisco and New York . . . so ask around and      you'll find someone to start you off. If you live near West      Forks, Maine, stop in and see me. I'll be glad to give you      some lessons.    </p>    <p>      If you can't find an instructor, the other possibility is      to get a manual and follow the directions. In      fact-though I can hardly recommend the use of a book      alone-you'll need such a guide even when you have      someone to help you.    </p>    <p>      A few of the texts I use include: <em>Professional      Fly-Tying, Spinning and Tackle-Making Manual and      Manufacturer's Guide</em> by George Herter, available from      Herter's, Inc., Route 2, Interstate 90, Mitchell, South      Dakota 57301 (regular edition $2.97, deluxe edition $3.97).      This guide is very complete, even a little overdone. The      condensed version (98 cents) is more to the point and less      confusing for the beginner. <em>Flies</em> by J. Edson      Leonard, published by A.S. Barnes, New York ($8.95). A      complete manual with a list of 2,200 patterns.      <em>Noll</em> <em>Guide</em> <em>to Trout Flies and How to      Tie Them,</em> published by Davis-Delaney-Arrow, Inc., New      York, and available at most chain stores or from H.J. Noll,      Inc., P.O. Box 308, Plumsteadville, Pennsylvania 18949      ($3.50 postpaid). Beautiful color plates of flies and      materials, but not very much how-to information.      Nevertheless, because of the illustrations and the low      price, every fly-tier should have a copy.    </p>    <h3>MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      Here are the basic supplies you'll need when you begin to      practice your new craft:    </p>    <p>      VISE. Not the heavy workshop variety but a most handy tool      that clamps securely to a table and holds a hook firmly in      place while a fly is being formed around it. Buy the best      you can find . . . the Thompson vise is of excellent      quality.    </p>    <p>      SCISSORS. Purchase two pair of good steel scissors that      taper to a fine point. One should be very small and the      other have blades about 3-1/2" long.    </p>    <p>      DUBBING NEEDLE. This small tool is used for numerous      precision jobs such as removing cement from the eye of a      hook or releasing feathers that may have been tied down by      mistake. You might try a hatpin, or make a substitute by      embedding a needle in a wooden dowel.    </p>    <p>      BOBBIN. A little gadget that conveniently holds down your      tying silk as you work on a fly. Some craftsmen don't use a      bobbin, but it might make matters a bit easier for a      beginner.    </p>    <p>      HACKLE PLIERS are a type of small, spring-action forceps      which are used to turn hackle feathers around a hook. Not      all fly-tiers use this tool but the majority who do      wouldn't be without it.    </p>    <p>      FLY-TYING CEMENT comes in small jars and helps hold bits of      material together.    </p>    <p>      FLY-TYING WAX. Unless your tying silk is prewaxed, you      should coat it with this substance to add strength and      adhesion.    </p>    <p>      ASSORTED FEATHERS, FURS, SILKS, TINSELS AND HOOKS. Caution:      <em>never</em> purchase any feather or fur which comes from      an endangered species, even though such materials may be      for sale. Unfortunately, many fly patterns call for      supplies like condor quills and polar bear hair and other      substances which are now definitely "off limits" . . .      you'll see what I mean when you look through the catalogs.      Although it's currently illegal to sell many of these      products, some may still be offered, and I urge you to be      very careful when making purchases. Always use substitutes      if buying the real thing may jeopardize the future of a      species.    </p>        <h3>WHERE TO OBTAIN MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      The largest mail-order supplier of fly-tying equipment      is-once again-Herter's. Their prices are low      and the quality of their material is about average.      <em>(You should also know that Herter's was recently fined      for importing feathers from nearly extinct      birds.-MOTHER.)</em> Request a catalog, and-if      you can find a fly-tier to get you started-have him      or her help you put in an order.    </p>    <p>      Herter's will supply you with a complete kit which includes      manual, tools, materials, hooks . . . in fact, everything      you need to tie a lot of flies (over 1,000, the company      claims, if you order one of its $17.00 packages). Get their      Model 9 vise-which comes in most of Herter's      kits-and buy a bobbin separately if one isn't      included.    </p>    <p>      Try to avoid purchasing material in small quantities from      retail fishing tackle stores . . . often the quality is      poor and the prices high. Don't buy a cheap kit, either:      Such an inferior package deal usually contains a clumsy      (and therefore worthless) vise.    </p>    <p>      No matter how you choose to purchase your supplies, the      initial investment-the price of finding out whether      fly-tying will be profitable for you-should be under      $20.00. Compared to other crafts, the cost of getting      started is extremely low.    </p>    <h3>RECYCLED MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      Make every effort to use recycled materials. A furrier will      probably give you all the fur scraps you can possibly use      in a thousand years and the rooster, duck or goose feathers      called for in many patterns may be available from fowl      you've slaughtered on your own homestead. You might      experiment with fibers from reeds found growing locally.      Broken rubber bands make excellent bodies for certain      flies, old tinfoil can be useful and even the red strip of      cellophane from some cigarette packs may come in handy.    </p>    <p>      Once you start tying, in fact, everything-even living      creatures-seems to become a potential source of      material for your craft. A snip or two of hair from your      cat or dog is most useful and will hardly be missed by the      pet, but you may have to chase your lady around the barn to      get one of her curly locks to complete a fly that just has      to be tied.    </p>    <h3>PATTERNS AND PATTERNS</h3>    <p>      As a learner you'll be tying the most simple patterns, but      in a very short period your skill will progress to the      point at which you'll be able to construct practically all      the known flies. You'll probably start creating your own      varieties, too, but I'd advise you to master the      traditional designs first because fishermen usually prefer      to buy flies that have established a name for themselves      over the years.    </p>    <p>      Although the great majority of these lures are tied for the      purpose of catching trout and salmon, some patterns are      used almost exclusively for bass. Saltwater fishermen, too,      have favorites of their own. Inquire locally to find out      what flies sportsmen are using in your waters.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO SELL YOUR WORK</h3>    <p>      Some fishermen, of course, tie their own flies, but many      don't . . . they don't want to take the time, or just don't      feel competent to do the job, or believe that a device they      purchase is better at catching fish than one they could      make themselves. At any rate, you should be able to locate      buyers for your products without much trouble.    </p>    <p>      To find a market, go to a sporting goods store or other      business that sells fishing tackle and study the      workmanship and prices of the flies offered for sale.      You'll probably find cheap Japanese import monstrosities at      20 cents each, some finely tied works of art that sell for      $1.00 . . . and other lures that fall somewhere in between.    </p>    <p>      When you have an idea of the going rates, approach the      shop's proprietor and ask him if he'd be interested in b      uying flies from you outright...or you might work out a      consignment arrangement with him. You may wish to package      your work attractively for sale through the store, or you      may leave the flies loose in small containers. (I've even      wrapped my products in cellophane envelopes and stapled the      packets to a piece of cardboard, which then placed in a      restaurant frequented by fishermen.)    </p>    <p>      Instead of dealing with a business, some craftsmen hang up      signs and sell their products direct from home. You might      even try showing samples at sportsmen's meeting places such      as boat rental docks and landings. Then if the flies you      tie are beautifully handcrafted-as they should      be--you'll probably get some custom orders from      fishermen who want favorite patterns tied to their own      particular specifications. You might also place ads for      custom work in <em>Outdoor Life, Sports</em> <em>Afield,      Field and Stream</em> or <em>Fly Fisherman.</em>    </p>    <p>      Another selling possibility is to prepare custom-tied flies      for decorative purposes. You can make tiepins of the lures,      for instance, or embed them in clear molded plastic for tie      clasps, cuff links, paperweights or whatever. You can also      create handsome wall plaques (by mounting 12 different      landlocked salmon flies in an interesting pattern, to cite      just one example). Fine stores such as Orvis, in Vermont,      or Abercrombie and Fitch-in New York, Ver mont and      other locations-might be interested in carrying these      ornaments . . but only if your work is absolutely top      quality.    </p>    <h3>WHAT TO CHARGE</h3>    <p>      Depending on the pattern, a fly will take you anywhere from      three to ten minutes to tie once you become fairly      proficient. The cost of the supplies that go into its      making will vary from a penny (the cost of the hook plus      free recycled materials) to 15 cents (if you use      store-bought goods like floss silk and chenille). Naturally      you'll keep these facts in mind when you set your prices.    </p>    <p>      The quality of your work, however, is the most important      factor in determining what you can charge. Fine      craftsmanship commands a high price, and fishermen will pay      you a fair for good products . . . say 50 cents for a very      simple pattern and well $1.00 for an exotic salmon fly.      Experience will soon teach you how much to ask.<br />      If you maintain a high standard and sell only perfect      flies, you'll find that your creations attract not just      trout and salmon, but customers! . . . and what began as an      absorbing pasttime may turn out to be a very plea way of      picking up a few extra do in your spare time. Good luck,      and I hope you enjoy fly-tying as much have over the years.    </p>
