                    <p>      OK, Homesteaders . . . here's the last installment of      Morton Salt's superior booklet, A COMPLETE GUIDE TO HOME      MEAT CURING. MOTHER NO. 20 took you through cutting and      curing beef, veal and wild game. This final section tells      you how to cut a lamb carcass and how to keep cured meats.    </p>    <p>      Although we've serialized the complete handbook, we still      advise you to drop $1.25 into the mail and add the manual      to your farmstead bookshelf. It's packed with valuable      information on butchering, cutting up and curing pork,      beef, veal, lamb, poultry and wild game. Get your copy from      Morton Salt Company, P.O. Box 355, Argo, Illinois 60501.    </p>    <p>      Again, our special thanks to Murray J. Pearthree, Morton      Salt Regional Sales Manager, for granting us written      permission to reprint from the booklet.    </p>        <p>      <em>The black guide lines on the picture at the right      clearly show where to make the cuts to separate the lamb      carcass into the most desirable pieces for using fresh or      for curing.</em>    </p>    <p>      The flesh of lamb is light pink, deepening in color as it      ages. The lamb meat is firm and fine grained, the fat is      white, hard, and flaky.    </p>    <p>      The lamb carcass, like beef, has thirteen pairs of ribs.      Ordinarily the lamb carcass is not split. In warm weather,      however, the carcass may be split in halves down the      backbone with a meat saw to aid in chilling. A sharp      butcher knife, saw, cleaver, and boning knife are the      necessary tools for cutting up the lamb carcass. There are      many different ways of cutting the lamb carcass. Just how      the cuts are made depends a good deal on how the meat is to      be used, whether most of it is to be used up fresh, canned,      or cured. The larger cuts, like the legs and shoulders, are      the best cuts for curing. A leg of lamb, when neatly      trimmed and cured, has somewhat the appearance of a ham.    </p>    <p>      Corned lamb is easy to make and the breast and shank are      good cuts for corning. One of the best ways to use the      small pieces and trimmings is to make lamb patties or lamb      and pork sausage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>REMOVING THE SHOULDER</strong> Saw off the shoulder      between the fifth and sixth ribs, as ordinarily a five rib      chuck is preferable. After the shoulder is removed, cut off      the neck on a line flush with the top of the shoulder, and      saw off the shank. Separate the right and left shoulders by      sawing through the backbone. Where a narrow shoulder is      preferred, saw between the third and fourth ribs instead of      between the fifth and sixth.    </p>            <p>      <strong>SAWING OFF THE BREAST PIECE</strong> Turn the      carcass on its side with the legs toward you and remove the      breast with a saw, cutting forward from the flank.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SEPARATING THE RACK FROM THE LOIN</strong> To      remove the rack cut between the last two ribs and complete      the cut with a saw through the backbone.    </p>    <p>      The rack is used for making a crown roast or, after      splitting, rib chops are cut from the rack.    </p>            <p>      <strong>SEPARATING THE LOIN FROM THE LEG</strong> The loin      is separated from the leg at the small of the back or at      the pin bone.    </p>    <p>      Start the cut with a knife and complete with the saw      through the backbone.    </p>            <p>      <strong>REMOVING LAMB SIRLOIN</strong> The sirloin is cut      from the loin end of the carcass in whatever thickness is      desired, The sirloin makes an excellent small size roast.    </p>            <p>      <strong>SPLITTING THE LAMB LEGS</strong> The legs are      separated by splitting them down the center with the saw.    </p>                 <p>      <strong>SHOULDER</strong> A long cut shoulder is used for      making a boneless rolled shoulder. Remove the neck bone and      ribs from the shoulder. Next unjoint the shoulder blade and      remove arm and blade bones, working from the inside of the      shoulder. Unjoint and remove arm bone from the shank and      remove meat from around joint end of shank bone.    </p>    <p>      The shoulder is then rolled and tied, making an attractive      long cut boneless shoulder. This can be used fresh as a      roast or can be pumped and cured with Tender-Quick.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NECK</strong> Cut the neck in slices about      three-quarters to one inch thick. They can be used for      braising, stewing, or cooking in casserole. Another method      of serving is to remove bone from the center of the slices      and fill with sausage made from the trimmings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SHANK</strong> Remove the shank when making a      square cut lamb shoulder where it is desired to cure the      shoulder, make shoulder chops, or to bone and roll the      shoulder. The shank is used for stewing, meat broth, or      small shank roast.    </p>        <p>      <strong>BREAST</strong> The breast, when boned and rolled, makes an      attractive cut. Remove rib ends and breast bone and roll by      starting at the shank, rolling tightly, and tie with heavy      cord. The rolled breast is used for roast or for curing and      canning.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RACK</strong> An attractive crown roast of lamb or      rib chops is made from the rack. For making rib chops,      split the rack lengthwise through the center and make chops      by slicing between the ribs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CROWN ROAST OF LAMB</strong> For making a crown      roast the size of the roast depends on the number of ribs      used. It is difficult to make a crown roast of lamb unless      there are about six or eight ribs cut from each side of the      rack. Usually eight ribs are used for the average size      roast.    </p>        <p>      For making a crown roast, place the rack rib side up and      saw ribs from each side of the backbone, as pictured above.      Then trim out the backbone with a knife without separating      the sets of ribs. Next remove a strip of meat about two      inches wide from the end of the ribs and trim out meat      between the ends of the ribs by trimming down one side of      the rib, across and up on the next rib.    </p>    <p>      Bend the rack and mold into shape and tie the two sets of      ribs together. Paper frills placed on the ends of the ribs      add to the attractive appearance of the crown roast after      it is cooked. Illustration shows the crown roast after it      is formed, and the piece of backbone and two inch strip of      meat that was trimmed from the rib ends.    </p>    <p>      When cooking wrap rib ends with salt pork and fill crown      with bread stuffing.    </p>        <p>      <strong>LOIN</strong> The loin may be boned, rolled, and tied for making      into a delicious, easily carved roast, or it may be cured      and canned. To bone the loin, loosen the tenderloin on each      side of the backbone, pulling the tenderloin back, then      remove the ribs and backbone. After the loin is boned,      tightly roll it and tie with strong white cord. Lamb chops      may also be cut from the loin.    </p>    <p>      The thin outer membrane or fell should be removed from the      chop cuts like rack and loin before cooking. Illustration      shows fell being removed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FLANK</strong> The flank makes an excellent piece      for stewing when cut into small chunks, or it can be ground      up with other trimmings for making lamb patties.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SIRLOIN</strong> The sirloin makes a small roast of      excellent quality when boned, rolled, and tied. After      sirloin is removed from the rack, trim out the backbone and      hip bones.    </p>            <p>      When bones are removed, mold and roll the sirloin into      shape, tying together with heavy cord at the flesh ends.      Illustration above shows the boned and rolled sirloin ready      for roasting or ready for curing with Tender-Quick.    </p>        <p>      <strong>LEG</strong> The lamb leg, when neatly trimmed in regular manner, as      pictured above, makes an excellent piece for pumping and      curing. It has somewhat the shape and appearance of a ham      and after curing can be wrapped and kept for future use.    </p>    <p>      One of the best ways to use the small pieces and trimmings      is to make lamb patties or cured lamb and pork sausage.      Lamb patties are improved by adding one-third pork, which      tends to bind them together and prevent crumbling when      cooking.    </p>    <p>      For using the lamb leg fresh, the two most popular methods      are to make either a French or American style leg.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FRENCH STYLE LEG</strong> Illustration below shows      first step in making French style leg, which is scoring      around the leg about two inches above the joint.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CUT AT BREAK JOINT</strong> Next cut at the break      joint on inside of leg. The break joint is indicated by      faint jagged lines just above the hock joint.    </p>            <p>      <strong>BREAK OVER TABLE EDGE</strong> After cutting at the      break joint, grasp shank and bend down over edge of table      until broken.    </p>    <p>      Next, twist shank until it comes free from the leg bone.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AMERICAN STYLE LEG</strong> The American style leg      has most of the bone removed and when cooked will fit into      a smaller pan or oven than the French style.    </p>    <p>      First, cut across break joint and remove shank bone, then      cut meat with point of knife down each side of leg bone and      remove leg bone at knuckle joint. Slit a pocket by      separating fell from meat on inside of leg and tuck shank      meat into this pocket. Use small skewers to hold shank meat      in place.    </p>            <h3>» curing </h3>    <p>      <em>First pump the larger pieces, and pieces that have      bone, with a Tender-Quick pumping pickle, pumping 1 oz. to      1-1/2 oz. of pickle per pound of meat. The pumping pickle      is made by mixing 2 lbs. of Tender-Quick per gallon of      water.</em>    </p>    <p>      After the meat is pumped, use about 6 lbs. Tender-Quick per      100 lbs. of meat. Divide the Tender-Quick into      approximately three equal parts and first rub the meat with      one-third of the Tender-Quick. Then in three or four hours      rub on the second one-third, and after twenty-four hours      rub on the balance. Pack the meat in a stone crock, box or      barrel for curing, putting, the large pieces on the bottom      and the smaller ones on top. Overhaul and repack the meat      in a different position when the curing time is about      one-half up.    </p>    <p>      The meat should remain in cure for about 1 1/2 days per      pound; for example, 6-lb. pieces 9 days 10-lb. pieces 15      days. Where a light cure is desired, leave the meat in cure      only one day per pound    </p>    <p>      When the curing time is finished, brush off the surplus      cure, or lightly wash each piece in tepid water and let the      meat drain thoroughly. After the pieces are thoroughly dry,      wrap them in parchment paper and hang away in the driest,      coolest, best-ventilated place available. If the meat is      damp when hung away, or kept in a damp warm place, it will      mold much faster than if it kept dry and cool and in a well      ventilated place. A little mold, however, does not hurt the      meat as it can easily be washed off with vinegar or trimmed      off when the meat is used.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SWEET PICKLE CURE</strong>    </p>    <p>      After the meat is pumped, pack it in a stone crock or      clean, well scalded barrel, putting the heavy pieces at the      bottom and lighter ones on top. Then mix a TenderQuick      curing pickle at the rate of 2 lbs. Tender-Quick per gallon      of water. The water should be previously boiled and allowed      to cool. Stir the curing pickle until the Tender-Quick is      completely dissolved. Pour the curing pickle over the meat      until the meat pack begins to shift, then weight the meat      down with a clean stone or other weight and pour in enough      additional curing pickle so that the top layer of meat is a      few inches below the pickle. It will take five or six      gallons of curing pickle for 100 lbs. of meat, depending on      how closely the meat is packed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LENGTH OF CURING TIME</strong>    </p>    <p>      Leave the meat in the curing pickle about 2 days per pound.      Where a light cure is desired, leave the meat in cure 1 1/2      days per pound. The meat should be overhauled and the      position of the pieces changes when the curing time is      about one-half up. When overhauling, it is best to remove      the pickle, then change the position of the pieces by      repacking, and pour the pickle back over the meat.    </p>    <p>      After the curing time is up, wash the meat in tepid water      and let it dry thoroughly. When it thoroughly dry, wrap in      parchment paper and hang away in a cool, dry,      well-ventilated place.    </p>    <h3>» keeping cured meats </h3>    <p>      <em>Meat that is properly cured will keep for many months,      the exact time depending upon the strength of the cure, the      kind and cut of meat, and the care with which it is wrapped      and stored.</em>    </p>    <p>      Meat to be used shortly after it comes from the cure should      not be given as heavy a cure as meat that is to be kept for      a long time.    </p>    <p>      Very often someone will state that the meat they have just      cured is too salty. This should be controlled by the      individual when putting the meat in cure. Meat that is to      be used up soon should have a light cure and should not      remain in the cure longer than the necessary curing time.      Weather conditions help control the length of time meat      should cure for best results, as it requires longer for      meat to take the salt if the weather remains real cold than      it does during favorable curing weather.    </p>    <p>      Bacon is usually at its best shortly after it comes from      the cure and for this reason most people prefer to use up      the bacon during the spring and early summer. When properly      cured and wrapped, however, bacon can be kept over for a      good while, but should not be kept longer than a year.      Bacon has a high per cent of fat meat and fat meat turns      yellow and gets rancid quicker than lean meat.    </p>    <p>      Shoulders should be used up before the hams as shoulders      are more apt to crack open and allow mold to penetrate.    </p>    <p>      Hams usually improve with age, being at their best after      they are about a year old.    </p>    <p>      Beef and mutton do not keep as well as pork and, therefore,      should be used up sooner.    </p>    <p>      Regardless of the way the meat was cured, or the kind of      meat, proper care when storing: the meat is necessary if it      is to be kept in good condition for any length of time.      Following are some of the points to observe for keeping      meat.    </p>    <p>      1. Keep meat dry. The moisture in the air of the room where      meat is stored will condense on the meat and favor      bacterial growth. Moisture will also cause mold to develop      more rapidly.    </p>    <p>      2. Keep meat cool, Heat also encourages bacterial activity,      causing decay.    </p>    <p>      3. Keep well ventilated. Meat absorbs flavors and odors      very rapidly. Ventilation will keep the air free from      taints, as well as prevent the condensation of moisture on      the meat.    </p>    <p>      4. Keep meat away from direct light. Direct sunlight      discolors meat, therefore, the place where the meat is      stored should be kept dark an this will also help keep      flies away.    </p>    <p>      5. Keep each piece separate. If the pieces meat touch or      hang too close together, it will prevent free air      circulation and sweating will often take place at the point      of contact.    </p>    <p>      6. Keep meat storage room screened. Flies rats, and mice      should never be allowed to get in the room where meat is      stored, and flies should not be allowed to light on the      meat as they carry bacteria which can cause decay and      actual spoilage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SKIPPERS</strong> The skipper is the larva of a      small black fly which is found in most sections of the      country. These flies are small enough to go through      ordinary window screening and for this reason a very fine      screening should be used for protecting meat storage rooms.      The fly lays eggs in the crevices of the meat and the      skipper hatches out and feeds on the meat.    </p>    <p>      The skipper is a slender white maggot about 1/3 of an inch      long when full grown. The skipper burrows into the interior      of the meat, eating out the meat tissues until the entire      piece of meat is ruined.    </p>    <p>      As the skipper fly is not active during cold weather, the      best time to butcher and cure meat that is to be kept for      some time is during the winter months. The curing box or      curing room should be protected with a fine mesh screen and      the meat should be washed and wrapped as soon as practical      after curing, in order to fully protect it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WRAPPING</strong> After curing, meat should be      wrapped only when it has been allowed to thoroughly dry.      When meat is not wrapped after it is dry, a slow oxidation      of fat takes place, which causes rancidness, dark color,      and strong flavor. Wrapping meat tends to prevent this,      besides furnishing the best possible protection against      flies and other insects.    </p>    <p>      Before wrapping meat, sage or black and red pepper or other      spices may be rubbed lightly on each piece of meat for      added flavor.    </p>    <p>      Wrap the meat first in cheesecloth or unbleached muslin and      wrap each piece separately. Clean flour or cornmeal sacks      make satisfactory wrapping for meat. Next wrap the meat      tightly in paper. Parchment paper is excellent but any      heavy plain paper will do. After wrapping, put the meat in      bags or wrap again in heavy brown paper. It is difficult to      prevent some mold from forming. With cloth next to the      meat, however, much of the mold that forms will be removed      with the cloth whereas if paper is next to the meat it will      stick to the meat and be hard to remove.    </p>    <p>      Turn the strings in before wrapping. Do not hang the meat      in storage by strings that are tied directly to the meat.      The wrapped meat should be tied tightly and looped from the      outside and hung by this outside string, If a paper bag is      used, fold the top of the bag over several times and tie it      tightly. If the meat is simply wrapped in paper, it is a      good idea to seal the edges with glue. Further protection      can be added by painting the entire outside of the entire      piece of wrapped meat with yellow wash or with ordinary      lime wash to which glue has been added.    </p>    <p>      <strong>YELLOW WASH</strong> The following is a standard      formula for yellow wash and is sufficient for about 100      lbs. of meat:    </p>    <p>      1 oz Dry Cure<br />      6 oz. Flour<br />      3 lbs. Barium Sulphate<br />      1 1/4 oz. Yellow Ocher<br />      <br />      Mix the flour in a half pail of water, stirring until      smooth. Dissolve the Yellow Ocher in one quart of water and      add this solution, together with the glue, to the flour      mixture in the pail. Bring to a boil and add the Barium      Sulphate slowly, stirring constantly. Make the wash the day      before it is to be used so that it will have time to cool.      Stir frequently while using and apply with a brush.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROTECT MEAT AGAINST SKIPPERS AND MOLD</strong>      When meat is properly washed, dried, and wrapped, it will      keep in good condition. This is the best protection against      skippers, insects, and mold. It is very important, however,      to see that the meat is thoroughly dry before it is      wrapped, because if the meat is still damp when wrapped,      mold will readily form. A reasonable amount of mold does      not hurt the meat. Very often high quality meat is allowed      to mold and before the meat is cooked the mold is removed.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, if mold should develop on your meat, it need      cause no serious worry because it can usually be ribbed or      cut off without loss. Mold may easily be removed by      scrubbing the surface of the meat with a brush dipped in      hot water. Another good way is to wash the meat with a      cloth dipped in vinegar and then rub the meat with a little      warm lard.    </p>    <p>      <strong>USE SHOULDERS FIRST</strong> Mold is most apt to      appear on shoulders because they crack open easier. It is      good practice to use the shoulders first to avoid excess      mold.    </p>    <p>      When a ham or large piece of meat is cut. and it will be      some time before the balance of the meat is used, the cut      surface should be smeared over with lard or covered with      oiled paper.    </p>    <p>      Modern curing methods and your home freezer now bring      exciting new variety to the meat menu and make possible an      endless variety of new meat dishes all year 'round.    </p>    <p>      <strong>YOUR HOME FREEZER KNOWS NO SEASON</strong> Now you      can have mild cured meal and freshly made sausage any time      of the year.    </p>    <p>      A new, easy method of curing meat that works hand in hand      with fresh meat or your home freezer, is bringing exciting      changes to the dinner table. Not since the first freshly      cured ham was hung in fragrant hickory smoke, has the      homemaker had such an opportunity to vary the meat menu so      easily and economically.    </p>    <p>      You can work the curing magic with any pork cut, shoulder      slices, boneless loin, spareribs or backribs and give a      tempting, mildcure flavor to other meats, such as beef,      poultry and game.    </p>    <p>      This seasoning method, developed by the Morton Salt      Company, so simplifies curing that you can do the job right      in your kitchen. Just rub Tender-Quick (or place in      Tender-Quick brine) over pieces of thawed meat selected      from your freezer. Then store in your refrigerator. Leave      them for a few hours, or overnight, depending on the cut of      meat and amount of cured flavor desired and you'll have      mildly cured, delicately flavored meat ready to cook.    </p>    <p>      Whether you butcher your own meat for processing and      freezing, or buy in quantity already processed, kitchen      curing will fit handily into your program.    </p>    <p>      No need to store whole hams or large pieces that are      difficult to wrap and waste freezer space. Cut fresh hams      into three parts . . . the ham butt, center slices and      shank. They pack away nicely and offer a whole new      storehouse of varieties.    </p>    <p>      Improved quality is another advantage of kitchen curing.      Meat is pleasingly firm.    </p>    <p>      You'll also enjoy the uniform flavor that kitchen curing      provides. By varying the curing time you can achieve an      extremely mild to a full, rich flavor, to suit the most      particular member of your family.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THAWING FROZEN MEAT</strong> All meat taken from      the home freezer for curing must be thawed before curing.      Take the meat from the freezer (do not remove the wrapper)      allow it to stand at room temperature until it shows signs      of thawing. Then remove wrapper and place in a      refrigerator, or any place where the temperature is not      lower than 38° and not higher than 50°. 12 hours or      overnight is enough time to thaw the average size piece of      meat.    </p>    <p>      Cuts of meat which are to be mild-cured in brine for only a      few hours, can be cured at room temperatures up to 70      degrees. <em>Meat should never</em> <em>be put back in the      freezer or frozen while curing or after curing.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>CARE OF MEAT WHEN CURED</strong> Cured meat should      be kept under refrigeration or in any cool place where the      temperature is about 40°. Cured meat keeps well under      refrigeration and does not lose its fine flavor. It is best      when used within 5 days. When held longer than 5 days, it      may get sticky. When this happens, rub the outside surface      with plain salt until the sticky condition is gone, then      wash in cold water, dry, and place under refrigeration. The      meat should then be used in the next 2 or 3 days.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IT'S EASY TO DRY CURE MEAT IN PLASTIC BAGS</strong>      The picture below shows how easy it is to cure meat in      plastic bags and how neatly it's done. You apply      Tender-Quick to the meat you wish to cure-you do it      right in your kitchen without any mess-it's done      quickly and the meat cures fast. Slices and thin pieces      cure in 1 to 3 days. Larger pieces cure in 7 to 10 days.      When the Tender-Quick has been applied, put the meat in a      plastic bag, tie the open end of the bag and put it into      the refrigerator or any cool place not over 45°. Allow      the meat to remain in cure the proper length of time and it      is then ready to use. The curing time and the right amount      of cure to use for each cut of meat is specified in the      curing directions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURING BONELESS PORK LOIN OR CANADIAN      BACON</strong> Fresh or frozen pieces may be cured.    </p>    <p>      For dry cure, use 2 heaping tablespoons of Tender-Quick for      each pound of meat. Rub the Tender-Quick on all surfaces,      then put the meat in a plastic bag and tie the open end.      Place in a refrigerator not over 45° allow to cure 5 to      days. When curing time is up, remove the meat from the bag,      wash, then dry and the meat is ready to use.    </p>    <p>      For brine cure, mix 1 cup of Tender-Quick to 3 cups of      water. Place the boneless loin in a container, then pour      enough brine over the meat to completely cover it. Place in      a refrigerator not over 45°. Allow to cure 6 to 10      days. When curing time is up, follow above dry cure      directions.    </p>    <p>      This cut of meat, when cured, may be sliced and used as      Canadian Bacon.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURING BACON</strong> Any piece of fresh bacon      side, or frozen side which has been thawed, can be cured.      To dry cure, use 1 heaping tablespoon of Tender-Quick for      each pound of meat. Rub the cure into the piece of meat and      put it into a plastic bag. Place it in the refrigerator not      over 45°.    </p>    <p>      Curing time for dry or brine cure-allow 5 to 7 days;      when curing time is up, remove from container or plastic      bag, wash, dry and place in refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED BONELESS HAM</strong> Divide a fresh ham into      three parts; the knuckle and the cushion are the ideal      pieces for curing. The small slices taken from the butt end      of the cushion can be made into steaks; they may be cured      in slices the same as pork chops. The shank meat and      trimmings can be packaged, frozen, and later used for      making pork sausage.    </p>    <p>      Brine Cure: Mix 1 cup of Tender-Quick to 3 cups of water.      Place boneless pieces of ham in a clean container. Pour      enough brine over meat to completely cover it. Weight meat      down to keep it under the brine. Place in a refrigerator      about 45°.    </p>    <p>      Dry Cure: Use 2 heaping tablespoons of Tender-Quick for      each pound of meat; rub the Tender-Quick on all surfaces of      the meat, put the piece of ham in a plastic bag, tie up the      open end, and place in a refrigerator not over 45°.    </p>    <p>      Boneless shoulders and Boston Butts are cured in the same      manner as boneless hams.    </p>    <p>      The pieces are ready to use as they come from cure. If not      to be used when taken from cure, wash, dry and place in      refrigerator and use within 10 days. Ideal for baking or      boiling, can be sliced for frying or cut into thick slices      and baked.    </p>    <p>      Curing Time: 6 to 8 pound pieces, 10 days; 9 to 12 pound      pieces, 12 days; larger pieces, 15 days.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED PORK LOIN</strong> Pieces of fresh or frozen      pork loin can be cured.    </p>    <p>      A fully-cured loin, when baked, has the color of ham,      partly cured loin is pink around the edges and the color of      fresh pork roast in the center.    </p>    <p>      For dry cure, use 2 heaping tablespoons of Tender-Quick for      each pound of meat; rub the entire surface with      Tender-Quick. Put the piece of pork loin in a plastic bag      and tie the open end. Place it in the refrigerator, not      over 45°, allow to cure 3 or 4 days, for a partially      cured loin-6 to 8 days for a full-cured loin.    </p>    <p>      For brine cure, mix 1 cup of Tender-Quick to 3 cups of      water. Put the piece of loin in a clean container with      enough pickle to completely cover the loin. Place it in the      refrigerator, not over 45°. Allow to cure 4 to 5 days      for a partly-cured loin, 8 to 10 days for a full-cured      loin.    </p>    <p>      Cured pork loins may be used immediately or placed in the      refrigerator and used several days later.    </p>    <p>      There is much variety to be had from a cured pork loin.      Remove the bones, bake the boneless loin or use as      Canadian-style bacon. The ribs may be used for BarB-Q. Cut      loin into chops to fry or broil-thick chops may be      slit, making pockets for stuffing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED PORK CHOPS</strong> Fresh or frozen pork      chops can be cured. Thaw frozen chops before curing.    </p>    <p>      Mix 1/3 cup Tender-Quick to 1 cup of water. Put the chops      in a clean container with enough brine to completely cover      them. Allow to cure 6 to 8 hours, or, overnight for extra      thick chops; then chops are ready to use. Cured chops taken      from the brine may be used immediately or several days      later. They may be fried, broiled or baked. For variety,      slit and stuff before cooking.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED SPARE RIBS</strong> Fresh or frozen ribs can      be cured. Thaw frozen, ribs before curing.    </p>    <p>      Dry Cure: Use 1 heaping tablespoon of Tender-Quick for each      pound of ribs. Rub the cure on all parts of the spare ribs;      they may be left whole or cut into 3 or 4-rib strips. Put      the ribs in a plastic bag, tie the open end and allow to      cure 1 or 2 days in a refrigerator not over 45°.    </p>    <p>      For brine cure, mix 1/3 cup of Tender-Quick to 1 cup of      water. Cut the spare ribs into 3 or 4-rib pieces; put the      pieces in a clean container with enough brine over ribs to      completely cover them. Place in a refrigerator, not over      45°. Allow to cure 1 to 2 days.    </p>    <p>      When curing time is up wash and they are ready to use for      Bar-B-Q, baking, boiling or frying. Cured ribs have more      flavor and better color when cooked.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED CORNED BEEF</strong> Fresh beef or beef f rom      the freezer can be cured.    </p>    <p>      Make a brine by mixing 1 pound of Tender-Quick to 2 quarts      of water; for small batches, 1 cup of TenderQuick to 3 cups      of water.    </p>    <p>      Place meat in a clean container,.allowing some space for      the curing brine. Pour over meat enough brine to completely      cover it. Weight it down to keep it submerged. Cure in a      refrigerator, not over 45°. Cure 14 to 20 days,      depending on the thickness of the piece of meat. If the      meat is not used at the end of the curing time, leave in      brine 7 days longer. If it is not used then, it should be      taken from the brine, washed, dried, and placed in the      refrigerator. Cook within five days.    </p>    <p>      To cure small pieces for boiled dinners or for making      corned beef hash or a loaf, prepare the curing brine as      directed above. Place the pieces of meat in a clean bowl or      jar, add enough brine to cover. Allow to cure 6 to 7 days.      When curing time is up, remove meat from container and      cook.    </p>    <p>      To dry cure, use 2 tablespoons of Tender-Quick for each      pound of meat. Rub cure into meat. Then slip into a plastic      bag, tie open end, put bag in refrigerator. Cure 7 to 14      days depending on the thickness of the meat. Handle same as      for brine cure.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED HAM</strong> The ham butt can be baked as a      roast, uncured, or cured and baked. The slices can be cured      one or more slices at a time, and the shank used for      boiling or take out the bones and use the boneless meat for      making sausage.    </p>    <p>      To dry cure the ham butt, apply 2 tablespoons of      Tender-Quick for each pound of meat; put the meat into a      plastic bag and allow to cure 1 1/2 days per pound. The      slices are cured by applying 1 tablespoon Tender-Quick per      pound of meat or per average slice of ham. When cure has      been applied, put the slices of ham in plastic bags. Tie      the open end of the bags and place in the refrigerator for      curing-ham slices are ready to use after curing for 24      hours. It is advisable to use the cured slices within five      days.    </p>    <p>      This method of cutting and storing hams in the home freezer      and then, many months later, curing and making sausage is      practical and economical because it eliminates the storing      of hams whole or in pieces which are difficult to wrap and      which also take up a lot of extra space in your home      freezer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED TRIMMINGS</strong> Spread the trimmings on a      flat tray and add 2 heaping tablespoons of Tender-Quick to      each pound of meat; mix and pack in a bowl, plastic bag or      mason jar, to cure. For brine cure, mix 1/3 cup of      Tender-Quick to 1 cup of water. Place the meat in a clean      bowl or mason jar and cover with brine.    </p>    <p>      Curing should be done in a refrigerator, not over 45°.      Allow pork to cure 2 or 3 days, beef-5 to 6 days.    </p>    <p>      Cured trimmings can be used for making jellied loaves,      smoked sausage, summer sausage, Mettwurst, special pork      loaves, vinegar pickled meats, etc.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHICKEN IN TENDER-QUICK BRINE</strong> Use fresh      chickens or chicken from the freezer.    </p>    <p>      Mix 1/2 cup Tender-Quick to 3 cups of water. Place chicken      or pieces of chicken in a clean container and pour enough      brine over the chicken to cover. Place in refrigerator, not      over 45°. Allow to remain in brine 8 to 12 hours.      Placing chicken in Tender-Quick brine makes the meat firm      and gives the chicken a more desirable flavor when cooked.      It draws out any blood left around the joints and takes      away that barnyard taste found in poultry.    </p>    <p>      You will never know how much better fried, boiled, stewed      or baked chicken can taste until you have tried placing      them in Tender-Quick brine.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED DOMESTIC RABBIT</strong> Rabbits can be cured      whole or cut in pieces. Wash rabbit and place in a clean      container. Make a curing brine by mixing 1/2 cup of      Tender-Quick in 2 cups of water. Pour enough brine into the      container to completely cover the rabbit.    </p>    <p>      Allow to cure 24 hours, then take it from the brine, wash,      and it is ready to cook. If it is not to be cooked      immediately, place in the refrigerator and cook within 3 to      5 days after it is cured. Cured rabbit may be fried,      broiled, baked or stewed.    </p>    <p>      Tender-Quick brine draws out the blood, firms the meat and      improves the flavor.    </p>    <p>      Wild rabbits and small game placed in TenderQuick brine      before being cooked will have an improved flavor and it      helps reduce the strong game taste.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PORK SAUSAGE</strong> Fresh, unseasoned trimmings,      when frozen, hold their fresh flavor and can be used for      making delicious tasting pork sausage at any time.    </p>        <p>      Freeze fresh pork trimmings in 2 to 3 pound packages.      Trimmings should be 1/3 fat and 2/3 lean. When ready to      make sausage, take a package of frozen trimmings from the      freezer, allow to stand at room temperature 2 or 3 hours,      then remove wrapper or bag and cut meat into small pieces      convenient for grinding. Add Morton's Meat, Poultry and      Sausage Seasoning, 1 level tablespoon per pound of meat,      mix thoroughly, and grind into the same container in which      the meat and seasoning were mixed-any seasoning left      in the container will be picked up and mixed into the      freshly-ground sausage.    </p>    <p>      Sausage meat may be made into rolls, placed in the      refrigerator and, when chilled, sliced into patties as      needed, or it may be stuffed into casings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED TURKEY</strong> Fresh turkeys or turkeys      taken from the home freezer or locker can be cured.      Turkeys, capons, and chickens are cured the same way.      Select only plump, thick-breasted young birds.    </p>    <p>      Make the curing brine by mixing 1 pound of Tender-Quick to      3 quarts of water. Mix until Tender-Quick is completely      dissolved.    </p>    <p>      Put the turkey, capon or chicken into a clean container      just large enough to hold it, allowing space for the brine.      Pour into the container enough brine to completely cover      the bird. Weight it down to keep it submerged. Small      turkeys up to 10 pounds, capons and chickens, cure 3 days;      11 to 16 pound turkeys, cure 4 days; over 16 pounds, cure 5      days.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURED BEEF TONGUE</strong> Fresh tongues and frozen      tongues from the freezer, when thawed, can be cured. Mix I      cup Tender-Quick to 3 cups water. Wash tongue in warm      water, then place in a clean container. Pour into the      container enough brine to completely cover the tongue.      Place in a refrigerator or any cool place, temperature not      over 45°. Allow to cure 14 to 20 days, depending on the      size of the tongue.    </p>    <p>      Calf, lamb and pork tongues, cure 7 to 10 days.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PICKLED PIGS FEET OR HOCKS</strong> Use cured feet      for hocks. Curing gives better flavor and a pleasing pink      color to the pickled meat. Place feet or hocks in a      container and cover with water. Bring to a slow boil, and      allow to cook until tender. Wash in hot water. If feet were      cooked whole, split or cut into quarters. Hocks may be left      whole or made boneless.    </p>    <p>      While feet or hocks are still hot, pour enough vinegar      pickle (recipe below) over them to cover. Allow to cool at      room temperature, then place in refrigerator. Allow 2 to 3      days for vinegar pickle to penetrate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>VINEGAR Pickle</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 cups vinegar<br />      a bay leaf<br />      1 teaspoon whole cloves<br />      1 small onion, sliced    </p>    <p>      Combine above ingredients and bring to a boil. Then lower      heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain liquid to remove      solids, and add 1 1/2 cups of hot water and 1 tablespoon of      sugar. Double or triple the above recipe for large amounts.      Pour hot liquor over the warm meat; vinegar flavor      penetrates faster when used hot on warm cuts of meat.    </p>
