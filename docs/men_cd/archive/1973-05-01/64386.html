            					 <h5 id="byline">      by Charles F. Jenkins</h5>           <p>      Two thousand dollars per acre with only average production,      and double the money for exceptional results . . . that's      what strawberries can do for you. What better helper could      you find to pay off the mortgage on the old homestead?    </p>    <p>      Of course-as my neighbor John Zoeller would be quick      to tell you-a modest amount of work (mostly      supervisory) goes into this fine cash crop. But that fact      doesn't keep the young New Riegel, Ohio grower from looking      forward to his next year of raising and marketing berries      as a sideline.    </p>    <p>      Back two springs ago-when he found that his regular      40-hour job left him with plenty of evening working time      after the switch to daylight saving-John decided he      could stand more action, and started looking into the      glowing reports he'd heard about the strawberry business.      The big, luscious specimens pictured in nursery catalogs      were as hypnotic as the shining disc swinging from a      mesmerist's bony fingers, and the growing instructions      almost implied that anyone could produce a bountiful crop      by waving a magic wand.    </p>    <p>      However, Zoeller-born and bred on a farm-wasn't      easily fooled. He knew that only weeds are that simple to      raise. To learn the sweet and sour sides of strawberry      culture, he visited an established commercial grower . . .      and was startled to find that the records he examined there      made the catalog claims look almost modest!    </p>    <p>      Once he knew the idea was sound, John's next question was,      "Where do I plant my cash crop?" There was no space around      the house he rented, so Zoeller propositioned his      father-a successful nearby farmer with plenty of      acreage-for a sliver from one of his fields.    </p>    <p>      Wilfred Zoeller enthusiastically endorsed his son's idea.      He even suggested that more land be devoted to the      undertaking so that John's two teenage sisters could share      in the project. After talking it over, the family agreed      that two or three acres between the farmhouse and the      highway-where customers could park safely along the      lane leading to the Zoeller house-looked like a good      location. They decided to set out two and a half acres of      strawberries immediately (so they'd have fruit to sell the      following spring).    </p>    <p>      Since the budding strawberry tycoon hadn't had his      inspiration until mid-May-six weeks past the crop's      recommended planting time for John's area-time was      short. Two decisions had to be made quickly: what variety      of plants to buy, and where to purchase them.    </p>    <p>      Trying to make such a choice from the lush descriptions and      pictures in a catalog is a real embarrassment of riches.      Fortunately for the beginning grower, the Rayner Bros.      <em>Berry Book</em> (available free from Rayner Bros.,      Inc., Salisbury, Maryland 21801) gives a very helpful box      score under the heading "Characteristics of Some Strawberry      Varieties".    </p>    <p>      The Rayner list rates various types of strawberries and      judges which are best for certain qualities: flavor and      excellence for general home use; goodness for freezing, and      for making preserves; firmness; large size; high yields;      vigor and growth in poor or dry land; suitability for cold      climates, and for the Southern States: resistance to red      stele, verticillium wilt and leaf troubles.    </p>    <p>      Surecrop was picked as the best variety for nine of these      twelve criteria, and Zoeller was tempted to order nothing      else. However, the neighboring berry producer-who had      grown strawberries for several seasons-was high on a      variety called Midway, and John ended up sending for plants      of both kinds.    </p>    <p>      Dormant stock-which suffers least shock when      transplanted-may be bought from many reputable      nurseries if the order is placed early enough in the year.      As the season progresses, however, plants awaken by      geographical area . . . early in the South, later in the      North. To be secure, Zoeller sent for his supply from a      grower in the shadow of the Straits of Mackinac Bridge in      northern Michigan.    </p>    <p>      With the order safely placed, John began to think about      planting. Space recommendations for strawberries vary as      much as politician's promises, but Zoeller decided on rows      42 inches apart with 22 inches between plants. That worked      out to something like 7,500 sets per acre . . . a grand      total of 18,000 for the planned area.    </p>    <p>      "Eighteen thousand individual seedlings . . . each of which      must be placed in its own hole!" thought John. "Wow. Even      if I waddle along like a tortoise and set every one of the      plants with one hand while I cover and irrigate it with the      other, it'll take me all summer just to put them in the      ground." Zoeller's tension was finally eased when a      neighbor loaned him the use of a tomato planter for the      job.    </p>    <p>      While he waited for his stock to arrive, John prepared the      bed carefully to give each of his purchases the best chance      for survival . . . and, because strawberries should go into      the ground as soon as possible after receipt, he made sure      everything was ready when the shipment rolled in.    </p>    <p>      Then the work of putting out the sets began, and the young      businessman found that the tomato planter-though      extremely helpful-had its shortcomings. The trouble      was that tomatoes aren't particular about how deep they're      planted, so the implement that digs the holes doesn't need      to be accurate about depth . . . and John's borrowed piece      of equipment wasn't. Strawberries, however, must be set      with the crown of each plant flush to the surface, and the      only way to maintain this exacting depth was to go slowly      and spend twice as long on the task. (Zoeller learned only      later that the tool's manufacturer could have sold him a      special attachment to adapt the planter for his crop.)    </p>    <p>      On top of the planting difficulties, Zoeller's whole first      year in the strawberry business turned out pretty rocky.      The plants were all set out by June 1, and on June 5 they      were almost drowned in an inch and a half of rain. Then, as      soon as the crusted earth was dry enough, the field was      cultivated twice. On June 11 came another inch of downpour      . . . and from that time until early September you could      have counted the drops of rain on the fingers of one hand.      As the earth grew parched, the Surecrop plants lived up to      their reputation for drought resistance, but Midway fared      badly and half of that variety was lost.    </p>    <p>      John's worries about the bad weather were partly offset by      the relief of having little to do for most of the summer.      Other than weeding, the only major project was the 12-hour      job of picking or pinching bloom stems to encourage bigger      and better berries the following year.    </p>    <p>      The first productive season of the new venture started off      with a beautiful spring. Runners from the parent plants had      filled the intervening spaces with strong, healthy      offspring, and the buzzing bees that held a daily      convention in the field ensured lots of delicious fruit a      few weeks later.    </p>    <p>      Soon, as June breeze flipped the green capes of the plants      to show flashes of crimson beneath, laborers sent from the      state employment office began to harvest beautiful berries.      (At the rate of $1.00 for every eight quarts picked, these      workers earned above-average daily wages.) John also      reserved a portion of each week during the bearing season      for "Pick Your Own" harvesters, who paid 35 cents per quart      for the fruit they gathered.    </p>    <p>      It was interesting to compare the picking methods of the      two groups. The professionals-whose object was to      fill their boxes as fast as possible-took all the      ripe berries as they moved down a row and didn't pile fruit      on top where it might roll off. By contrast, the "Pick Your      Own" customers (99% housewives taking a break from dishes      and dusting) were not only too selective to pluck anything      less than the largest red morsels . . . but heaped each      basket high enough to shame the ancient Egyptian pyramid      builders. The medium and small berries which they passed up      became a problem that John solved only by sending his      family out to glean the rows once the do-it-yourselfers had      picked them over.    </p>    <p>      The professionals' harvest was sold at the farm for      55 cents a quart, and case lots were offered stores at the      same price (delivered). Though it may sound a bit      ridiculous at first to set the same price for wholesale and      retail sales, the reasoning was very logical. After all,      local merchants normally depended on large produce houses      for their supplies. and those firms in turn relied on      commercial growers many miles distant By the time berries      were picked in Illinois or Indiana, shipped to Toledo and      delivered to stores in Tiffin and Fostoria, the fruit was      firmly packed down and some of it mashed. This forced the      retailer to dump, sort and refill each box before he could      offer the shipment for sale. In comparison, John's      fresh-picked produce-which was more attractive to      customers anyway-proved to be a bargain.    </p>    <p>      Zoeller's strawberry patch was about as far off the beaten      path as it could be, and he wondered whether the remote      location would hurt his sales. As it turned out, he needn't      worried. He solicited wholesale orders by telephone and      arranged deliveries at the convenience of the merchant.    </p>    <p>      The Zoeller retail business flourished too, once low-cost      classified newspaper ads and free radio publicity twice day      had alerted citizens for miles around that the delicious      fresh berries were ready. In fact, John's experience bore      out a recent report published by the Ohio Agricultural      Research and Development Center, in which Dr. M.E. Cravens      states that location is no longer especially important to      the sale of freshfrom-the-fields farm produce.    </p>            <p>      Out-of-the-way or not, Zoeller's business has done pretty      well so far. Although he denies renting an armored truck to      carry his first season's loot to the bank, John does admit      that the total number of quarts picked from his two and a      half acres was a strong average figure even after the      plants' poor start. Over the coming months Zoeller expects      to do even better than the normal expectation of 4,000 to      6,000 quarts per acre.    </p>    <p>      The same plants can't bear at that rate forever, of course,      and the Ohio grower is managing his plot with an eye to the      future. When John's first marketing season ended, he tilled      under the east edge of every long northsouth row of berry      plants. All runners were then trained toward the west,      where they were contained within 12 inches to form a matted      strip of new, strong plants alongside an equal width of      older stock. By cultivating in this way Zoeller will renew      half the bed each year, and may possibly be able to make      his initial investment a final one.    </p>    <p>      There's nothing unique about this young Ohio entrepreneur's      success with his cash crop. Anyone who wants to make a few      hundred (or a few thousand) back-to-the-land dollars with      minimum effort should be able to do it with strawberries.    </p>    <p>      If you have your own acreage, of course, you're all set . .      . and if not, you can lease garden space.      Everywhere-including the edges of      communities-there are small tracts which are nothing      but a summer weed problem to their owners. Check around.      You should be able to find at least one landlord of a      vacant city lot who will be happy to have you relieve him      of its maintenance. Remember, also, that your operation      needn't be in one piece . . . several nearby plots might      work out well for you. <em>(Your beds won't bear until the      second year, of course, so make your agreements      accordingly.-MOTHER.)</em> And preparation of the      soil is no problem because you can rent power equipment or      hire the owner of a machine to till your ground for a small      fee.    </p>    <p>      The market for strawberries appears to be insatiable, and      when your plants produce you should find plenty of buyers      willing to pay good prices. If you find sales slowing up at      the end of the short season (usually less than a month), a      discount of a few  cents per quart will probably wipe out      any surplus.    </p>    <p>      If you don't care to plant in volume, remember that you can      still enjoy your own fresh-picked, tasty fruit . . . from      as little space as the borders of your sidewalk-if      you're still citybound-or from that sandy corner of      your homestead that you weren't really sure what to do      with. Even a window box of everbearing plants might give      you a sauce dish of delicious berries several times a year.      In short, strawberries are a cooperative crop and will      reward you well whether you grow them for pleasure or for a      very tidy profit.<br />    </p>
