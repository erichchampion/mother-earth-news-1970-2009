                    <h5 id="byline">      by H.C. Matthews    </h5>        <p>      We hear about marigold, nasturtium and various herbs that      can help keep bugs off the vegetables in the garden . . .      but what about something to shoo insect pests from the      gardener?    </p>    <p>      Stinging gnats-which bite about the face, eyes and      behind the ears-really annoy me. Once, when the      swelling from such a bite had nearly closed my right eye, I      went to a doctor who wrote me a prescription ($4.00). I      took the piece of paper to the drugstore and had it filled      ($3.50). Then I swallowed the capsules and, in less than an      hour, was staggering around like a drunkard. Another day      and the swelling (also my $7.50) was gone.    </p>    <p>      Now when the gnats start buzzing, I pull a handful of      spearmint or lemon mint, squeeze it to crush the leaves and      rub the crumpled foliage where the little devils like to      bite. The pests keep flying around, but won't light nor      sink their fangs into me as long as the fragrant odor      lasts.    </p>    <p>      Yes, I know: every supermarket and drugstore sells chemical      insect repellents that will do the same job and do it      longer. I also know that a drop of those commercial      formulations in your eye can be much worse than a gnat      sting. Such repellents have even been known to dissolve      plastic watch crystals and eyeglass frames.    </p>    <p>      I'll stick with my mints. I have the plants growing in      several places around the garden and I'm never far from      their pleasant protection.    </p>
