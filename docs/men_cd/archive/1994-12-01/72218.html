        <p><em><strong>Make your caroling brighter in minutes. Plus, home remedies to avoid.</strong></em></p><p>Imitation pierced-tin candle holders may be used to set the mood for athome holiday events or to light the way during evening caroling. For each candle holder, you'll need an empty soup can, cleaned and with the label removed. If the label is printed on, lightly sand the can so it will accept paint.</p><p>You'll also need a scrap of wood that's smaller than the can and rounded to match its shape, a vice, tin snips, an electric drill (or a hammer and a pointed punch or stout nail), a sheet of plain paper, carbon paper, a pencil, some adhesive tape, and a can of spray paint.</p><p>If you'll be using your candle holder indoors, leave the bottom of the can intact; if outdoors, drill a hole in the bottom of the can. Using the tin snips, cut slits around the edges of the hole and fold them inside the can, widening the hole until it's slightly smaller than the candle you intend to use.</p><p>Next, make a paper pattern for the design you'll punch out. Cut the paper to fit around the can, then fold the paper in half. On one side, sketch an easy holiday design, such as a star, Christmas tree, or simple snowflake. Use the carbon paper to copy the pattern onto the other side of the paper, so the front and back of your candle holder will have the same design. Lay the paper flat and pierce the design all around with the pencil to create 1/8" dots, about 1/4" apart. Tape the paper pattern to the can.</p><p>With the shaped wood firmly held by the jaws of the vise, slip the pattern-covered can over the wood and carefully drill or punch out the marked holes. Spray the can with one coat of paint.</p><p>For indoor use, center a votive candle in the candle holder. If you'll be using the candle holder outdoors, insert a 6" long candle into the hole, leaving 3" protruding from the bottom for a handle.</p><p><strong><em>-Gail Damerow</em></strong></p><p>Sure Cures?</p><p>Even if you are convinced that modern medicine leaves something to be desired (and who isn't occasionally convinced?), be grateful you weren't born 100 years ago. Back then, for every remedy concocted that proved effective, there were dozens with ...dubious cure rates. Here are just a few that have managed to withstand the test of time.</p><p>Drink two quarts of whiskey to effect a sure cure for snakebite.<br />To stop a toothache in your left jaw, tie a string around the little toe of your right foot.For the right jaw, reverse the directions.<br />Whooping cough may be cured by passing the afflicted person seven times through the arch of a bramble bush.<br />This treatment works for migraine sufferers as well.<br />Onions placed under a sick person's bed will draw off poisons.<br />An iron key pressed to the back of the neck will stop a nosebleed.<br />A gold wedding band rubbed upon a sty in the eye will heal it.<br />A piece of red wool, wrapped around a sprained ankle seven times will heal the hurt, but only if you chant, while bandaging the hurt limb, "Bone to bone, vein to vein, get thee whole and well again."<br />Take care not to let the moon shine on your face while sleeping; otherwise you'll wake up crazy.<br />If you catch a falling leaf on the first day of autumn, you will not catch a cold all winter.<br />To cure a patient with fever, simply burn the feathers of a black hen beneath the patient's bed. If the fever proves stubborn, take a piece of clean cloth, tie three knots in it, run the patient's forehead with the cloth and place it under some running water to let the fever trapped in the fabric flow out. And if that doesn't do the trick, carefully wash the afflicted person using a pail of water, throw the water over a cat, and chase the cat outside. The fever is then the cat's problem.<br />If you want to cure insomnia, put jimsonweed leaves in your shoes before going to bed, making sure to point your shoes toward the nearest wall.<br />However, you should always be certain that you're lying in bed with your head due north, so you're in the proper flow with the earth's magnetic waves.Eating bread hot from the oven was a sure way to get stomach cramps. You could avoid them, though, by wearing a ring made from the hinge of a used coffin.<br />To cure fits, the sufferer was told to walk into a church around midnight, stroll three times up each aisle, then walk out of the church into direct sunlight.<br />Speaking of rings, always apply salves, balms, and unctions with the ring finger of the left hand only. The reasoning behind this, of course, is that witches always point with their right forefingers when cursing their victims.<br />Fnally, if you have a blue vein on the bridge of your nose, you'll live a happy but short life. Get out that makeup.</p><p><em><strong>-Don Griffith</strong></em></p>
