            	<p>	   <strong>GARDEN HINTS</strong>    </p>    	 <p>	    <strong>Three unusual candidates for early plantings, from      seed to harvest.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      SCORZONERA & SALSIFY    </h3>    <p>      These two root crops have a taste reminiscent of oysters.    </p>    <p>      <em>Scorzonera hispanica,</em> known as scorzonera, also      called black salsify, black oyster plant, and viper's      grass.    </p>    <p>      <em>Tragopogon porrifolius</em> , known as salsify, also      called white salsify, oyster plant, and vegetable oyster.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Growing range:</strong> Throughout America.    </p>    <p>      <strong>History:</strong> Originating in the Mediterranean      area, scorzonera and salsify were foraged and used by the      ancient Romans as well as the Greeks. People never thought      to cultivate them until sometime around the 1500s. They      were then used for ornamental, medicinal, and culinary      purposes. In the Middle Ages, scorzonera was considered a      powerful tonic and snakebite cure - hence the name      viper's grass. Salsify came to America in the 1700s and was      at one time a popular root crop. When modern refrigeration      and shipping techniques made the storage of perishable      foods easy, salsify fell out of favor.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Appearance:</strong> Scorzonera, or black salsify,      has a uniformly straight root that's covered with a      charcoal or brown-gray, somewhat slippery skin. It usually      grows longer, straighter, and smoother than salsify. The      leaves look like a clump of coarse grass. With some      varieties, the leaves are "cut and come again" greens that      make a fresh addition to salads.    </p>    <p>      Salsify, or white salsify, has a root about the size of a      large carrot. Bumpy like a parsnip, the salsify root has      dirty-beige skin. The root looks a bit wilder than      scorzonera and the leaves also look like a clump of grass.      (Indeed, many people have weeded out young salsify or      scorzonera and then wondered why their crop didn't      germinate!) Both plants are biennials.    </p>    <p>      Scorzonera has an oyster-like taste. Salsify's flavor has      been described as a cross between oysters and asparagus.      Some people complain that salsify is blander, more fibrous,      and harder to peel than scorzonera. Others remain loyal to      salsify. Grow small plantings of both and decide for      yourself.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Planting:</strong> Both plants are grown the same      way. Sow seed as early in the spring as the ground can be      worked. The frosts of spring and fall will only improve the      roots' flavor, and salsify and scorzonera need at least 120      days to create good-sized tubers. In warm climates, you can      plant about 4 months before the first frost or 3months      before the onset of cool weather.    </p>    <p>      Work the soil until it's loose and rock-free at least a      foot deep. Do not use fresh manure as it makes roots fork.      Because potassium helps build healthy roots, wood ashes,      granite, or greensand are good additions. The pH should be      close to neutral (between 6.0 and 8.0).    </p>    <p>      Sow the seeds thickly, 1 inch deep in rows that are 12 to      15 inches apart, then thin the seedlings to about 4 inches      apart. Or start the seeds in flats where they can get off      to a good start without accidentally being weeded out, and      then transplant. You can either let a few plants go to seed      (this will happen the following spring) or buy new seed      each year, but don't expect any unused seed to last for an      extra year. It probably won't.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Culture:</strong> Salsify and scorzonera need      little care. They are not as domesticated as most common      root crops, so they are hardier and more self-sufficient.      They seem to grow, out of sight and out of mind, until      ready to harvest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pests:</strong> Virtually none.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Harvest:</strong> Both oyster plants definitely      taste best fresh from the ground. They discolor and lose      flavor quickly once dug; all fall, dig only what you need      at the time. Be sure to dig deeply so you get the whole      root without cutting it or it will "bleed."    </p>    <p>      Right before the ground freezes solid (if that happens in      your area), dig what you will need for the harshest of      winter and store in damp sand in a root cellar or outdoor      pit with a lid. Cut off the tops of the remaining roots and      mulch them heavily. When the soil thaws in spring, dig      those last roots and store them in a dark place to prevent      sprouting.    </p>    <p>      You should scrub the roots before cooking but it's best not      to peel them. The skin can be rubbed off afterwards, if you      prefer, but leave it on at least that long so it can      contribute flavor and vitamins. Cover freshly cooked roots      with a weak lemon juice or vinegar solution to avoid      discoloration (unless they will be an ingredient in a soup,      soufflé, or other dish where they will not be      exposed to air). Both vegetables do not can or freeze well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Uses:</strong> Salsify and scorzonera are often      used to make mock oyster soup or chowder. They are also      good steamed and served with butter or special sauces,      fried, baked or braised with meats, and in stews, soups,      soufflés and quiches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nutrition:</strong> A good source of calcium, iron,      and phosphorus.    </p>	<h3>			CELTUCE    </h3>		<p>      True to its name, this one offers two vegetables at once:      the flavors of celery and lettuce.    </p>    <p>      <em>Lactuca sativa</em> var. <em>asparagina</em> , also      called asparagus lettuce, stem lettuce, and Chinese      lettuce.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Growing range:</strong> Most of the U.S. -      wherever lettuce will grow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>History:</strong> Celtuce originated in China and      is often called Chinese lettuce in seed catalogs. It was      apparently first brought from China to America in 1940 by a      returning missionary.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Appearance:</strong> The name, appearance, and      taste are all combinations of celery and lettuce. First to      appear are lettucy leaves: light green and elongated but      not deeply wrinkled. Though soft in texture, these fresh      greens stand up to heat, cold, and even salad dressing      surprisingly well. The second growth is the celery-like      stalk or base that looks somewhat like a stalk of broccoli      with its leaves removed. A mature plant looks a little like      a miniature tropical tree.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Planting:</strong> Celtuce tolerates a wide variety      of soils. In fact, it does far better in clay soil than      lettuce does. Of course, building your soil into good tilth      and boosting its fertility with compost or aged manure will      give you an even better crop.    </p>    <p>      This is one of those vegetables that gives you an excuse to      garden early in the season. You can start seed as early as      the ground can be worked. Plant seeds shallowly, as you      would lettuce seeds, only 1/4-inch deep in rows 12 to 18      inches apart. Remember to water often. In fact, you may      want to lay boards, burlap, etc., over the ground to help      keep the top layer moist so your seeds won't dry out. Check      daily, and remove the cover as soon as germination has      begun.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Culture:</strong> You can start enjoying the      lettucelike leaves about a month and a half after planting.      If you plant your seeds fairly close together, you can make      several thinnings - this will give you a much larger      harvest for the same space. Besides, the young and tender      leaves of the first growth taste the best. You can even sow      the rows themselves two to three times closer than normal      and thin out whole rows.    </p>    <p>      Continue to provide plenty of water. They grow quickly and      will soon keep most weeds shaded out, though you may need      to weed some while the crop is still young.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pests:</strong> Chinese lettuce is much more      resistant to pests than ordinary lettuce. Still, slugs,      aphids, cutworms, or leafhoppers could bother your crop. To      control slugs, handpick them at night, set ground-level      saucers of beer for them to hide under (then collect them),      or treat plants with diatomaceous earth or wormwood tea. A      strong water spray, yellow sticky traps, ladybugs or      diatomaceous earth should help control aphids. To stop      cutworms, spray them with <em>Bacillus</em>      <em>thuringiensis,</em> handpick them at night, or mulch      plants with a rough material like oak leaves, crushed egg      shells, or damp wood ashes. Or put a stiff collar (like a      yogurt container with the bottom removed) around the plant.      Limit leafhoppers by covering young plants with a      spunbonded row cover or by dusting with pyrethrum or      diatomaceous earth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Harvest:</strong> In about 45 days you can begin      the harvest of the "tuce" part of the celtuce. Pick the      outer leaves to keep the center producing new ones. Celtuce      leaves wilt quickly, so pick just before a meal or store in      the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      The leaves might develop a bitter, milky juice when broken,      just like lettuce that's past its prime. This is usually      while the stalk is being formed. Depending on your growing      conditions, your leaf harvest may be short, with only young      leaves being palatable, or quite long, with larger leaves      tasting great too.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, about 3 months after planting, the "cel" part      is ready to harvest. Pull whole plants and cut off the      roots. Next, strip the leaves and then peel the outer skin      (it also contains milky sap). The light green inner core is      now ready to use whenever the crunch of celery is needed.      Unpeeled stalks will keep in the refrigerator for about as      long as celery would.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Uses:</strong> Both parts of celtuce can be enjoyed      in salads, soups, stews, and sandwiches. They can also be      stir-fried, sautéed with a sauce of your choice, or      pureed. The stalks can be served with dip.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nutrition:</strong> High in vitamin C - up to      four times that of lettuce.    </p>
