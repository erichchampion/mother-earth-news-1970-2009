            		<p>				<strong>SEASONS</strong>    </p>    			<p>	      <strong>Is there a perfect tree? Fred Schaaf nominates fall's      "queen of firewood."</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>There are so many different places in the United States      and the rest of the world with lovely autumn foliage      displays and so many trees with outstanding colors. But      let's be honest: The locale most famous for awesome fall      leaf hues is Vermont and the tree most famous is the sugar      maple.</em>    </p>        <h3>      The World's Most Beatiful Tree?    </h3>    <p>      Over 40 years ago, Rutherford Platt wrote <em>American      Trees; A Book of Discovery</em> <em>,</em> a volume in      which he described several hundred species with great      eloquence and with truly unsurpassable enthusiasm. But      among countless favorites was there a "best" tree? He      wrote, "If you would see perfection, go look at the maple.      It is like truth made into the form of a tree." And about      one particular kind of maple: "Sugar maple is [the] most      successful tree, and contender for the title of most      beautiful tree in the world."    </p>    <p>      I feel sure that by "successful," Platt here meant      successful at being the artistic essence of what a tree      should be. I say this because the sugar maple is not most      successful in the more prosaic sense of being able to      establish itself in a great variety of climates.    </p>        <p>      As Platt himself notes elsewhere, the sugar maple is not a      big-city tree; it needs fresh, pure air. And it has other      requirements, for unlike the also beautiful and colorful      red maple (which is more tolerant of different soil types),      it does not grow all over the eastern United States. One      authoritative guide says it grows south to North Carolina      and Tennessee, west to eastern Kansas, and in localized      areas of northwestern South Carolina and northern Georgia.      A map shows it extending to southern Missouri but      surprisingly not into Arkansas. (Would any of our readers      beg to differ?) Platt also notes that the sugar maple is a      distinctively American tree; it will not grow in England.    </p>    <p>      Platt goes on to explain what perfect balance there is in      all parts of a maple, from overall design to smallest      detail, and how healthy and successfully adjusted to its      environment the maple is. The wood is one of the very best      for furniture and for firewood. All of these attributes are      preeminently true of the sugar maple ("the queen of      firewood," it doesn't throw out sparks). In addition, there      is of course the tree's role as the source of the best sap      for maple syrup. But the time to tap for syrup making is      early spring.    </p>    <p>      In autumn, the sugar maple leaves flame first with gold,      then start adding orange, and finally might (or might not)      finish with red. A maple with red leaves is more likely to      be red maple than sugar maple, but the variety of the sugar      maple's colors is wonderful - and so is stopping at      orange. After all, orange is the perfect complement to the      blue sky of clear, sunny days. And it is the clear, sunny      days that are best - in concert with clear, cold      nights - for inducing bright colors.    </p>        <p>		  The ultimate way to tell a sugar maple leaf from a red      maple leaf is to look at the curve      between the lobes of the leaf. If the curve forms a rounded      U shape, the leaf belongs to a sugar maple; if the curve      forms a sharper V shape, then the leaf belongs to a red      maple.    </p>    <p>      If you wish to preserve some of the most beautiful of      colored autumn leaves, you can easily do so. Just use the      transparent, sticky-backed paper available at many grocery,      hardware, and craft stores. Put your leaf or leaves on a      piece of poster board. Next, cut out a piece of adhesive      paper a bit larger than the leaf, peel off the backing, and      press it with the sticky side down over the leaf. Just make      sure the piece of sticky paper is large enough and that you      smooth it to press out any air bubbles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TRUTH MADE INTO FORM</strong><br />      <strong>The sugar maple isn't a big-city tree. It needs      pure, fresh air to flourish.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      The Far Light in Andromeda    </h3>    <p>      This fall, in October and November, watchers of the night      sky can see Mercury and Venus before dawn, a very slight      lunar eclipse, and some other special astronomical events      that not every year brings. The best of these are described      briefly in the accompanying almanac table.    </p>    <p>      But there are certain astronomical sights that, although      visible every autumn, are irresistible to both veteran and      novice observer. One of these is the farthest light that      can be easily seen by the unaided eye: M31, the great      galaxy in the constellation Andromeda.    </p>    <p>      A galaxy is usually a collection of billions of stars in      space. Some galaxies, such as our own, the Milky Way, have      their stars arranged in a vast spiral. That is the case      with the Andromeda galaxy, too, but there is an important      difference: This "sister" of the Milky Way is about twice      as big.    </p>	<p>			A pair of binoculars may be needed to help you first    locate M31, especially if you live in or near a sizable city.    What to look for? With naked eye or binoculars, an elongated    fuzzy glow. When and where to look? Preferably when the moon    is not up and bright, and on November evenings between 8 and    10 P.M.; look almost directly overhead from anywhere in the    United States south of Alaska.	</p>	    <p>      Why does such a mighty galaxy, a wheel of several hundred      billion stars, appear relatively faint to the naked eye?      Because of the awesomely huge distance of M31. The      Andromeda galaxy is thought to lie over two million light-      years away. That means that the light you see reaching you      from M31 tonight left there over two million years ago.    </p>    <h3>      In Praise of November    </h3>    <p>      In his poem, "No," Thomas Hood wrote: "No shade, no shine,      no butterflies, no bees; No fruits, no flowers, no leaves,      no birds, - No-vember!"    </p>    <p>      How can we argue against lines that are so succinct and so      true? We have to concede that across much of the United      States - indeed, across much of the earth's north      temperate zone - November is a time when the whole      living world seems to have disappeared into death, sleep,      or forgetfulness.    </p>    <p>      In most of America, December is the cloudier and stormier      month (though some of the mightiest nor'easters and Great      Lakes storms - including tremendous lake-effect snows      - have taken place in November). But it is in      November that the loss of leaves, flowers, birds, and sunny      days first hits and hurts us.    </p>    <p>      An argument in defense of November can be made, however.      And the central point of that argument is that November is      the great time of rest, quiet, and reflection that we need      after September and October.    </p>    <p>      Those preceding months are so busy with harvest, migration,      and other preparations for winter; neither man nor beast      has time to reflect. Nor do we have much time to      contemplate when every day we see new hues on the trees and      every minute there are more leaves drifting down or flying      by. We have to wait until November to play the events and      the vivid sights back at leisure in our minds as we walk      down a road with soft, muted colors (or lack of colors) and      lowered lights (cloudy skies, low sun, and short days).      September and October may be the spectacular action-packed      climax to the story of the living world's year. But      November is its thoughtful epilogue.    </p>        <h3>      Fourth Thursday in November    </h3>    <p>      In last year's October/November issue, I discussed how      Sarah Josepha Hale and Abraham Lincoln were responsible for      establishing, back in 1863, the annual celebration of      Thanksgiving Day. The day that Lincoln set was the last      Thursday in November of every year. But the current role is      that Thanksgiving must fall on the fourth Thursday in      November and this is not always the last Thursday. For      instance, in 1990, Thanksgiving fell on November 22 because      that was the fourth - but not the last -      Thursday in the month. And next year, we'll be celebrating      Thanksgiving on November 23, again not the last Thursday in      the month.    </p>        <p>		  So how did we get the "fourth Thursday" rule? In 1939,      President Franklin D. Roosevelt - for reasons I have      never been able to discover - proclaimed that      Thanksgiving would henceforth fall on the next-to-last      Thursday in November. But the change was met with much      opposition; this was reportedly in part from commercial      interests. They were said to be afraid that an early      Thanksgiving would reduce the numbers of Christmas shoppers      on "Black Friday," the great Friday of Christmas-present      buying the day after Thanksgiving.    </p>    <p>      In the spring of 1941, Roosevelt relented, and in December      of that year, Congress formalized his declaration in a      joint resolution that Thanksgiving be observed on the      fourth Thursday of November.    </p>    <p>      Why the fourth Thursday instead of going back to the rule      of the final Thursday? Perhaps Roosevelt didn't want to      give in completely. In the midst of a time torn by a      rapidly approaching world war and the lingering effects of      the Depression, he knew how to compromise with his own      people enough to keep them satisfied-but also how to      maintain his own position enough to keep their respect for      his judgment and power.    </p>    <h3>      Almanac for October/November 1994    </h3>    <p>      <strong>October</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>4</strong> NEW MOON, 11:54 P.M.; day of St. Francis      of Assisi.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8</strong> Start of the Great Chicago Fire, 1871.    </p>    <p>      <strong>9</strong> Spring begins - in the northern      hemisphere of Mars! In 1903 on this date, 11.17 in. of rain      fell in 24 hours in New York City's Central Park.    </p>    <p>      <strong>10</strong> Columbus Day (observed); Thanksgiving      (Canada).    </p>    <p>      <strong>11</strong> FIRST QUARTER MOON, 3:18 P.M.    </p>    <p>      <strong>14</strong> Venus at its farthest south among      constellations for 1994. Now is also the time we might last      see it in the evening this year: very low in the southwest      just 15 minutes after sunset. Don't confuse it with      Jupiter, which is much higher to the upper right and may be      brighter than Venus because it is not in such brilliant      twilight sky.    </p>    <p>      <strong>15</strong> On this date in 1954, Hurricane Hazel      made landfall in South Carolina (this was one of the rare      hurricanes that maintained much of its power even after      hours over land; it carved a path of destruction up the      East Coast).    </p>    <p>      <strong>16</strong> Mars on west edge of the Beehive Star      Cluster. Mars now looks like a fairly bright star, slightly      orange, high in the east at dawn's first glimmering. Use      binoculars to see the lovely star cluster near it this      morning.    </p>    <p>      <strong>17</strong> Mars near center of Beehive Star      Cluster this morning.    </p>    <p>      <strong>18</strong> Alaska Day (in Alaska); start of      supposedly warmer spell called St. Luke's Little Summer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>19</strong> FULL MOON (Hunter Moon), 8:18 A.M.    </p>    <p>      <strong>21</strong> Columbus made landfall in America this      day in 1492; Mercury at "inferior conjunction" (unviewably      close to the Sun).    </p>    <p>      <strong>22</strong> Orion meteor shower peaks this morning,      but bright moonlight hinders viewing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>23</strong> Sun enters astrological sign Scorpio.    </p>    <p>      <strong>24</strong> United Nations Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>25</strong> Jupiter now almost lost in bright      twilight sky, very low in west-southwest about 20-30      minutes after sunset.    </p>    <p>      <strong>27</strong> LAST QUARTER MOON, 12:44 P.M.    </p>    <p>      <strong>28</strong> End of St. Luke's Little Summer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>29</strong> "Black Tuesday" stock market collapse      on this day in 1929.    </p>    <p>      <strong>30</strong> Set clocks back one hour this morning      at 2 A.M. (or when you go to bed before this) for return to      standard time; Sun enters constellation Libra.    </p>    <p>      <strong>31</strong> Halloween); Nevada Day (in Nevada).    </p>    <h3>      November    </h3>    <p>      <strong>1</strong> All Saints Day; Samhain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2</strong> All Souls Day; Taurid meteor shower at      peak for many nights around this time-if you live far from      city lights and get clear nights, you may see five or more      per hour of these brilliant and slow "shooting stars"      flying from high in the southeast late in the evening;      Venus at "inferior conjunction," unviewably close to the      Sun in the sky.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3</strong> NEW MOON, 8:35 A.M.; total eclipse of      the Sun visible in parts of South America.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4</strong> Will Rogers Day (Oklahoma).    </p>    <p>      <strong>5</strong> Mercury at greatest western elongation      from the Sun, thus visible fairly well in the east sky (or,      more precisely, east-southeast sky) before sunrise. This      elusive little planet puts on its best dawn showing of the      year for about a week before this date and about two weeks      after - but don't confuse it with the far brighter      Venus as the latter vaults into view before dawn in the      next week (see entry for November 14 below). By the way, in      England, November 5 is an occasion for fireworks and      mischief; it is Guy Fawkes Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>6</strong> A telescope now shows the rings of      Saturn    </p>        <p>      at their most tilted for the year (not very fitted, but a      lovely sight). Saturn currently appears to the naked eye as      the brightest point of light in the south a few hours after      sunset.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7</strong> Halfway point of autumn. Isn't it      surprising that for most of us half of autumn is a time of      bare trees and skies capable of letting loose with a      sizable snow?    </p>    <p>      <strong>8</strong> Election Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>10</strong> FIRST QUARTER MOON, 1:14 A.M.    </p>    <p>      <strong>11</strong> Veterans Day (the original World War I      "Armistice Day"); Martinmas; start of St. Martin's Summer      (supposedly warmer period).    </p>    <p>      <strong>13</strong> "The Night the Stars Fell on Alabama"      - in 1833 the night of an awesome Leonid meteor      storm. This show may be repeated for the United States in      1998 and 1999.    </p>    <p>      <strong>14</strong> Venus and Mercury closest to each other      (not very close) this morning. Look low in the      east-southeast about 45 minutes before sunrise and you'll      see the brilliant Venus with much dimmer Mercury slightly      higher to the left. Mercury now comes into view lower in      dawn twilight each day, Venus higher.    </p>    <p>      <strong>17</strong> Leonid meteor shower at normal peak      this morning - but only a few of these "shooting      stars" may be seen zipping out of the south in the last few      hours before dawn because bright moonlight will hinder      viewing them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>18</strong> FULL MOON, 1:57 A.M.; penumbral eclipse      of the Moon: the penumbra is only the peripheral shadow of      Earth and though about 91% of the moon goes into the      penumbra at this eclipse, we will still see only a slight      shading of the moon's upper part for about an hour centered      around 1:44 A.M. EST (late on the evening of November 17      for the western U.S.).    </p>    <p>      <strong>20</strong> End of St. Martin's Summer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>22</strong> Sun enters astrological sign      Sagittarius.    </p>    <p>      <strong>23</strong> Sun enters constellation Scorpius      - for 6 days.    </p>    <p>      <strong>24</strong> Thanksgiving Day (U.S.).    </p>    <p>      <strong>25</strong> St. Catherine's Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>26</strong> LAST QUARTER MOON, 2:04 A.M.    </p>    <p>      <strong>27</strong> First Sunday in Advent; John F. Kennedy      Day (in Massachusetts).    </p>    <p>      <strong>28</strong> Hanukkah.    </p>
