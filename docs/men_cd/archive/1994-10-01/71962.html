            	<p>	  <strong>NATURAL KITCHEN</strong>	</p>	<p>	  <strong>MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong>    </p>      <h5 id="byline">        BY Anne Vassal      </h5>		        <p>      <strong>The old reliable soup may be a favorite in the      fall, but there's lots more to do with the season's many      kinds of squash.</strong>    </p>        <p>      With a burst of fall color and frost on the pumpkins, the      Vassal household buttons down for fall. Charlie Brown will      once again await the arrival of the "Great Pumpkin" and      children will be carving their large orange prey and      roasting the seeds. I'll be taking the annual bus ride with      young students to a rural pumpkin patch to discover that,      yup, pumpkins really do grow on large vines. And anyone      with a garden filled with squash under those vines will be      looking for creative ways to get rid of them other than      carving them for Halloween. Fortunately, the versatile      winter squash can be used in stews, soups, breads, muffins,      pancakes, and - of course - pies. Most squash      will keep in a cool place for months so there's no hurry to      bake those pies yet. Cooked, pureed, and poured into      plastic containers, the squash stores well in the freezer.      The nutritious squash contains the cancer-preventing      beta-carotene (which converts into vitamin A), potassium,      fiber, and no fat. So don't let that 5-pound pumpkin      intimidate you. Go ahead and bake it, but don't forget to      save those pumpkin seeds for nutritious nibbling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Selecting and Storing Winter Squash</strong>    </p>    <p>      Look for firm, heavy squash without moldy spots or cracks.      The rind should be dull; shininess means it's immature.      Check to see that the stem isn't collapsed, moist, or      blackened. Most squash can be stored in a cool place such      as a garage or root cellar where the temperature is between      45° and 60°F for three to four months. Pumpkin and      spaghetti squash will keep for 1 to 2 months. If the      temperature is below 45°F (such as in a refrigerator)      or above 60°F, it will cause the squash to deteriorate      more rapidly. A cut squash can be wrapped in plastic wrap      and refrigerated for about a week.    </p>	<p>			<strong>Varieties</strong>	</p>	    <p>      <em>Pumpkin</em> - Large jack-o'-lantern varieties      are usually too stringy to eat. A smaller, sweeter variety,      such as sugar pumpkins, are better for pies and baking.      Most people use canned pumpkin for pies, which is      convenient but not as flavorful or nutritious.    </p>    <p>      <em>Acorn</em> - A small squash with dark green,      ribbed skin, it gets its name from its acorn shape. The      flesh is yellow to light orange with a mild flavor.    </p>    <p>      <em>Buttercup</em> - A turbanlike shape at the      blossom end and faint stripes on its dark green surface      identify this squash. The orange flesh is drier and more      flavorful than other squash, which makes it my favorite for      baking and eating.    </p>    <p>      <em>Butternut</em> - Not to be confused with      buttercup, it has a tan exterior with a bulb-like base. The      flesh is orange, moist, and milder tasting than the      buttercup. Both of these varieties can be used instead of      pumpkin for pumpkin pies.    </p>    <p>      <em>Spaghetti squash</em> - This yellow squash (which      is really a gourd) is oval shaped and, when cooked, has      spaghettilike strands. It has a mild taste and a crisp      texture.    </p>    <p>      <em>Kabocha</em> - Similar in appearance to the      buttercup squash, it has a rich, sweet flesh.    </p>    <p>      <em>Turban</em> - A larger, drum-shaped squash with a      green and orange skin, it gets its name from its      turban-shaped end. It makes a great table decoration but is      lacking in flavor.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Preparation</strong>    </p>    <p>      Baking: This is my favorite method because baking brings      out the sweetness by caramelizing some of its sugars and      best preserves the beta-carotene. Cut the squash lengthwise      and scrape out the seeds with a spoon, brush the cut side      with oil or butter, and place cut side down on a foil-lined      cookie sheet. For a moister squash, omit the oil and pour      inch of water in the pan. The squash halves can also be      baked wrapped in foil. Bake in a 350–375°F oven      for about an hour or until the squash can be pierced easily      with a knife.    </p>    <p>      Steaming: Place the seeded squash halves cut side down in a      vegetable steamer over 1 inch of water or use peeled and      cut cubes of squash. Cover and simmer for about 20–25      minutes, with less time needed for the cubes. Since this      method produces a moister squash, use less liquid than is      called for in recipes for baked goods.    </p>    <p>      Microwaving: Never microwave a whole squash because despite      what you may have heard, I can assure you that they      <em>can</em> explode. Arrange seeded squash halves cut side      down in a microwave-safe dish (glass pie pan) with 1/4-inch      water. Pierce the skin in a few places with a knife.      Microwave on high for 5 minutes, then move or rotate the      squash. Microwave for at least 5 more minutes until soft in      the center. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.    </p>    <h3>      Spicy Squash Soup    </h3>    <p>      Even if you've never cared for squash soup, try this one.      It's so delicious that it's worth the trouble.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Roasted vegetables:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon olive oil<br /></em> <em>2 large carrots (1      cup) - cut into 1/2-inch circles<br /></em> <em>1      large onion - peeled and quartered<br />      2 large cloves garlic - peeled<br /></em> <em>2      medium-sized yellow squashes (1 use buttercup) - cut      into eighths, seeds removed. You should have about 4 cups      of squash.</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350°F. In a soup pot, toss the carrots,      onion, and garlic together with the oil. Put the vegetable      and squash slices on a large cookie sheet covered with      foil. Bake about 30 minutes until soft and lightly browned.      Scrape squash from its shell.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Soup broth:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon toasted whole cumin seeds*<br />      2 cups unsalted chicken broth<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      1/8–1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      1 tablespoon brown sugar<br />      1/2 teaspoon allspice<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      2 cups water<br />      1/4 cup cream<br />      3/4 cup low fat milk<br />      optional topping: toasted, husked pumpkin seeds</em>    </p>    <p>      In a blender or food processor puree the vegetables and all      the soup ingredients in two batches until smooth. Pour into      the soup pot and simmer until hot. Add more cayenne or salt      if needed. If too thick, add more water. Sauté the      pumpkin seeds in a little butter or oil. Serve the soup      with a few seeds on top.    </p>    <p>      *In a dry skillet, heat the seeds on medium-high heat,      jiggling the pan for a minute or so until fragrant.    </p>        <h3>      Baked Acorn Squash    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 large acorn squashes - sliced across into      1/2–3/4-inch slices<br />      1 tablespoon butter<br />      1/2 teaspoon ginger<br />      1/2 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      1/4 teaspoon allspice<br />      dash cayenne pepper<br />      2 tablespoons apple cider<br />      2 tablespoons real maple syrup</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a large cookie sheet with      foil. Lay out the squash rings so they're not overlapping.      In a glass measuring cup (or saucepan on the stove) melt      the butter with the rest of the ingredients in the      microwave just until it starts to bubble (about 60–90      seconds). Brush or pour mixture onto the squash. Bake for      30 minutes, remove, and turn the rings over. Bake another      20–25 minutes until done.    </p>    <h3>      Harvest Salad    </h3>    <p>      Since I'm not crazy about cold squash, I serve this salad      at room temperature. It needs to be stored in the      refrigerator so I warm any leftover salad in the microwave      for about 30 seconds before serving.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 baked acorn squashes (see above recipe) - skin      removed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br />      2 cups cooked wild rice or Wehani* rice<br />      1/2 poblano pepper or red bell pepper - seeded and      cut into thin strips<br />      1/2 cup parsley or cilantro - minced</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dressing:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon balsamic or red wine vinegar<br />      1 tablespoon olive oil<br />      1/4 cup orange juice - freshly squeezed or store      bought<br />      1/2 teaspoon sugar<br />      1/4 teaspoon salt<br />      1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      freshly ground pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      Bake the squash and prepare the rice. Whisk together the      vinegar, oil, orange juice, sugar, salt, and pepper. Pour      over the salad and toss. Serve immediately.    </p>    <p>      *Made by Lundberg Farms and less expensive than wild rice.      To prepare wild rice: Put on 1 1/2 cups water to boil.      Rinse 1 cup rice and add to boiling water. Simmer covered      for 35–40 minutes until done. (I like it a little      chewy.)    </p>    <h3>      Spaghetti Squash with Ancho Sauce    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 large spaghetti squash - cut in half crosswise,      seeds scraped out with a spoon<br />      2 tablespoons packaged pumpkin seeds - toasted<br />      1 teaspoon mild oil<br />      2 large cloves garlic - peeled and smashed<br />      1/4 cup yellow onion - coarsely chopped<br />      1/2 teaspoon cumin<br />      1/2 cup chicken broth<br />      1 dried ancho chile - stem and core removed and cut      with scissors into 3 pieces*<br />      1 cup canned tomatoes in a little juice - coarsely      chopped<br />      1/2 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder<br />      1 teaspoon brown sugar<br />      pinch cinnamon<br />      pinch allspice<br />      fresh cilantro or parsley - chopped<br />      Mexican crumbling cheese or Muenster</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Squash:</strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F.      Place the squash halves cut side down on a foil-lined      cookie sheet. Stab the squash in a few places with a knife.      Bake about 1 hour until the strands are tender and pull      away easily. To save time, microwave both squash halves cut      side down for 10-15 minutes, rotating every 5 minutes. When      it's done, let it sit for a few minutes, then gently pull      the strands loose with a fork. Fluff up the squash on a      plate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet toast the      pumpkin seeds on medium-high heat for about 2 minutes,      shaking the pan constantly. Pour into a bowl and set aside.      Put the oil in the hot pan, add the garlic and onions.      Sauté on medium-high heat until lightly browned,      stirring occasionally. Stir in the cumin for a few seconds,      then add the broth, ancho chiles, tomatoes, and spices.      Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Pour into      a blender with the toasted seeds and blend well. Add salt      and freshly ground pepper to taste. The sauce should be the      consistency of marinara sauce. If it's too thick, add      additional chicken broth. Crumble the Mexican cheese by      hand, or put chilled cubes of Muenster cheese in a food      processor until it becomes crumbs. Spoon the sauce over the      squash and sprinkle with cheese and cilantro.    </p>    <p>      *Can be purchased at Mexican or South American groceries.    </p>    <h3>      Pumpkin/Squash Muffins    </h3>    <p>      Use a strong-tasting squash for these low-fat muffins. Make      a double batch because they freeze well.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 egg<br />      1/2 cup low fat milk<br />      1 cup cooked, pureed fresh pumpkin or squash (I use      buttercup squash)<br />      2 tablespoons canola (or any mild) oil<br />      1/4 cup brown sugar<br />      1 tablespoon maple syrup<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br />      1/4 teaspoon allspice<br />      1 cup oat bran<br />      1 cup sifted whole wheat pastry flour<br />      2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1/2 cup currants or mini chocolate or carob chips (for a      dessert muffin)</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a muffin pan with 12 paper      liners. Using an electric mixer beat together the egg,      squash, and oil. Add the sugar, maple syrup, spices, and      oat bran. Beat well. Briefly mix in the flour and baking      powder until just mixed. Stir in the currants or mini      chips. Bake for 20 minutes, just until lightly browned on      top (or inserted toothpick comes out clean). Cool on a      rack.    </p>    <h3>      Pesto Spread    </h3>    <p>      A nonsquash recipe but a recent favorite of mine: While      basil is plentiful in the garden, whip up this low-fat      spread to put on a vegetable sandwich or bagel. You need to      prepare the yogurt the night before.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 1/2 cups nonfat/low-fat plain yogurt<br />      2 large cloves garlic<br />      1 tablespoon pine nuts or walnuts - toasted<br />      1 cup basil leaves - packed<br />      1/4 teaspoon salt<br />      dash cayenne pepper<br />      1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil<br />      1 tablespoon lemon juice<br />      1 tablespoon freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan      cheese<br />      3 ounces low fat cream cheese</em>    </p>    <p>      The night before : pour the yogurt into a non-terry cloth      dish towel and place in a colander. Put the colander in the      sink and let drain until morning. It should be thick and      not watery. Chill until ready to use.    </p>    <p>      Toast the nuts in a dry skillet for a minute or so. In a      food processor (or by hand) chop the garlic, nuts, and      basil leaves. Add the salt, pepper, olive oil, and lemon      juice. Pulse a few times, then add the Romano and cream      cheese. Blend. Pulse in the yogurt cheese briefly (don't      over mix). Chill in a plastic container a few hours before      serving so it will thicken.    </p>
