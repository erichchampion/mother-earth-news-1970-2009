                <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S HEARTH</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>After a little grousing, our resident curmudgeon      finds something to deer about on the wood heating front</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">       By john Vivian    </h5>        <p>      <em>For some years now, this writer has made no secret of a      personal distaste for the cozy relationship that exists      among the lobbyist/lawyers for a few left-wing      environmentalist groups, the fortune 500 makers of      catalytic wood smoke combustors, and EPA and state      bureaucrats who are ever eager to expand their turf by      widening the impact of federal environmental legislation.      In "friendly" lawsuits, this cabal exploited federal and      state clean air laws into slapping fuel-efficiency and      smoke-emissions limits on all new stoves sold in the U.S.      - and did it so quickly that the fragmented      wood-burning stove industry couldn't mount an organized      resistance and the average wood-burning consumer never had      a chance to comment.</em>    </p>    <p>      The few U.S. wood stove makers that survived the end of the      70s wood heat boom elected to "join 'em, not fight 'em."      They retooled and - overnight it seemed - began      producing stoves equipped with catalytic smoke combustors      and automated draft controls that made them boxy, wheezy,      unresponsive, cold burning, and overpriced compared to the      free-breathing predecessors. They did burn clean -      but offered a significant benefit in only a handful of      inversion-prone Rocky Mountain valleys like Vail, Colorado,      and Missoula, Montana, or Pacific Coast smog basins      burdened with such cities as Seattle, Los Angeles, and      Portland. Though the offending smoke came from only a few      yuppie ski resorts, upscale suburbs, and college towns      where burning wood was more an exercise in political      correctness than a heating necessity, the restrictions were      applied wholesale and nationwide. The vast majority of      American wood burners are country folks living in areas of      normal airflow where smoke doesn't concentrate to      noticeable - to say nothing of harmful -      levels. They lack big-city incomes, burn wood to save      money, and they suddenly had no choice in a new stove but a      $1,500 catalytic.    </p>        <p>      There was, however, a quiet voice of reason somewhere in      the regulation process. EPA restrictions were reserved only      for the new "airtight" stoves - the ones that can be      closed up and restrict airflow so that a fire smolders,      producing the thick, acrid smoke that reputedly pitted      paint on the ski condos in Vail and on professorial Volvos      in Missoula. In the small print, the regulations exempted      free-breathing (nonairtight) heating stoves, open-draft      fireplaces, fireplace stoves, and cookstoves. Also, less      restrictive emission standards were applied to noncatalytic      airtight stoves - exemplified by the so-called      high-techs that use an insulated firebox and sophisticated      draft systems to burn cleanly without catalytic converters      and robotic air controls.    </p>    <p>      Last year we reported on the popularity of older low-tech      and no-tech stoves that escaped the government regulations,      though they are still liable to restriction by local zoning      boards, health commissions, and vigilante smog patrols. The      old-timers can be bought and sold as used appliances, are      reasonably priced, and lack the performance restrictions of      the new models, so they retain their appeal for experienced      country wood burners. Indeed, EPA or no, old-line U.S. and      Canadian stove foundries never really stopped making      traditional cooking ranges, 19th century-style log burners,      and potbellies in several sizes. And after being quietly      peddled while the application of the EPA regulations      settled, the old designs (as well as copies from Taiwan)      are once again appearing in hardware stores.    </p>    	        <p>      Last year (the 93/94 heating season) saw another joint      exercise between government regulators and the new stove      industry. In central New England, the newspapers began      headlining a new "clean air program" being promoted by the      government: inefficient and dirty-burning old wood stoves      were worth a $200 trade-in toward a new EPA Phase-2 stove.      A local reporter pinned down an extension service staffer      as to where the idea and the rebate money originated.      "Well, ah...from the stove shops?" was the sheepish reply.      The government was "...umm, just encouraging retirement of      old stoves. We all want cleaner air, you know." In other      words, some enterprising stove peddlers managed to press      enough flesh to convince the regulators to (what is the      term ?)...shill for them. Or maybe it was the bureaucrats'      idea. It doesn't much matter. Nothing illegal, but it      leaves a bad taste in my mouth.    </p>    <p>      At last report, they were trying to extend the "program" to      other regions of the country. Lotsa luck. To be fair, in      everything but cost, the newest Phase-2 catalytics are a      great improvement over the earliest models. And $200 is a      nice discount off a $750 to $1,500 stove - even      though you can find pre-EPA "toilets" (the trade name for      Taiwan-made copies of popular domestic designs) for about      $200 in the un-EPA-restricted used appliance market. I      don't know an owner of a really fine quality, brightly      enameled, 70s Scandinavian-built Jotul or Morso, Irish-made      Waterford, or Vermont Castings Defiant who would consider      trading in their excellent old iron for a piddling $200. As      the owner of a 20-year-old Jotul Combi put it: "Hell, I      wouldn't swap this stove even for money for a shiny new      government stove and a year's supply of firewood, split and      stacked in the cellar."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Unexpected Backfire</strong>    </p>    <p>      The EPA regulations have produced a backlash that confutes      the very goals of clean air and efficient use of resources      that the agency was commissioned to promote. Still yearning      for the bright cheer and warmth of an open fire, much of      the home buying/remodeling public has given up on stoves      altogether and created a whole new demand for EPA-exempt      open fireplaces and freestanding fireplace stoves. The      manufacturers are quite logically responding to market      forces and have come out with products that offer the open      fire appeal that the EPA has regulated out of the      catalytics. Actually, a fireplace produces more smoke and      carbon dioxide and uses more wood than any stove, as they      smoke unless tended carefully and extract little useful      room heat from the fuel they use.    </p>    <p>      Check for yourself - it's hard to find a newspaper ad      featuring wood stoves anymore. Ads are all for fireplaces,      andirons, poker/shovel sets, and glass fire fronts. In my      little Maine town, Edmund Perkins has just changed the sign      in front of his shop from Ed's Wood Stoves to Ye Olde      Fireplace Shoppe, as it was before the 1970 stove boom. He      was once installing good heating Franklin fireplaces from      the Portland Iron Foundry or big steel TimberLand stoves in      vacation homes and TV room additions; he's now stocking up      on steel firebox forms for conventional brick and concrete      block fireplaces and those brightly painted, round      fireplaces in "conversation pits" that send their smoke      (and a lot of oil-heated room air) up a cone hanging from      the ceiling. It is a shame and a step backward in energy      conservation in my view.    </p>    <p>      Another environmentally negative development the EPA can      take credit for is that natural gas - and bottled      propane - burning stoves and gas logs have been      rediscovered, and gas burners are being purchased by home      owners who once would have elected to use a wood-burning      stove.    </p>    <p>      In sum, the EPAs wood-emissions restrictions have increased      the use of finite fossil fuel and discouraged use of      self-renewing wood (as gas logs replace wood stoves). At      the same time, they have decreased the heat efficiency of      wood that is burned and increased smoke and carbon dioxide      output (from the fuel-wasting, dirty-burning fireplaces      that are being installed in place of stoves).    </p>    <p>      Who was it that said that government programs never do seem      to accomplish what they set out to?    </p>    <h3>      JAZZING UP A STANDARD    </h3>    <p>      Several readers have asked where they can find literature      on and parts for the newly made old-design iron. Cheap      imports and low-tech, moderately priced stoves aren't being      sold direct by mail as they were back in the 70s. The more      elegant and more expensive modem parlor stoves of      soapstone, enameled iron, and steel are available-see      the ads in MOTHER. However, swinging-door Franklin      fireplaces, little columnar railroad stoves, rotund laundry      stoves, and even newly made ranges can be found in the back      rooms of most country hardware stores and in the mail-order      catalogs of Lehmans, Cumberland General Store, and other      country living supply merchandisers that advertise in      MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      But model-specific cast-iron parts for really old stoves      and steel parts for the hundreds of 70s fly-by-night brands      are hard to find. Except for stove bolts, parts weren't      standardized; each stove and its parts were unique. Your      best bet is to take a broken part to an iron or aluminum      foundry or to make up your own wooden pattern for a missing      part and see if a two-part sand mold can be made and a new      part cast. I've known of whole doors, major body plates,      and fire grates to be so reconstructed. Metal-working job      shops can fabricate practically any part for a tin or steel      stove, and can often make up a door, leg, lid, or even a      whole fire grate for an iron stove.    </p>    <p>      An unornamented low-tech iron stove costs the same dollar      per pound that it did years ago. The three-digit number      you'll find cast into the top or rear of stoves made from      original castings gives the weight (and price) for the      base-model stove; that is, without nickel plate, isinglass      in the door, or really fancy bas-relief in the castings. An      unadorned one-room-heating potbelly, laundry stove, or log      burner will cost about $200. Prices go up with size and      ornamentation to a newly made kitchen range that costs      about $2,500. A prime example of "artistry in iron" -      a full-featured range or ornate parlor heater with crisp,      smooth castings and nickel plate on footrests, aprons,      finials, and feet - can cost $1,500 to $5,000.    </p>    <p>      Many people would like to gussy up stoves that lack      ornamentation. Most old parlor stoves and cooking ranges      came in several levels of dress. The "Standard" might be      all black iron. The "Princess" might be made from the same      base castings but might have extra ornamentation on the      face of castings plus nickel plate on a skirt or footrests,      or covering the finials on top, feet, or draft controls, or      on the lacy little castings that are bolted to doors and      bodies to hold on isinglass sheets. The "Magnificent Andes      Parlor Brilliant" could be the same basic stove - but      with ornamentation such as extra smoke-buming or      draft-control inlets and isinglass portals in sides and      doors, nickel plate over bas-relief all around, and also on      fligreed doors, controls, skirts, pants, boots, and other      items of stove fine dress.    </p>    <p>      You can dress up your old standard by judicious application      of ornamentation. This is limited to nickel-plating parts      that can be removed and sent to a plating shop. Normally      the whole part is covered, though you can ask a plater if      they can grease all of a door except for the bas-relief      eagle on the front and apply the plate just to that. Or you      might be able to clean the casting to bare iron,      enamel-paint areas you don't want plated, and remove the      paint after - ask the plating boss. Originally, if      bas-relief areas of the stove body were plated, the shiny      stuff was usually applied to a sheet metal appliqué      that attached with small bolts or spring clips. You can      make new appliques by fixing a sheet of lead- or      copper-roof flashing over the relief and forming it by      tapping with a small hammer and blunt metal stylus. To      attach, drill small holes through the sheet and casting      with a diamond bit and attach with small bolts (you may      want to have bolt heads plated).    </p>    <p>      If your local silver and gold platers don't do nickel, they      may know someone who does. For service by mail, look for      platers' ads in the old car magazines. I can vouch for the      work done by Vermont Plating (113 South Main Street,      Rutland, VT 05701; 802-775-5759). Joe Shugrue and      associates have done hundreds of old stoves and you can      trust them to treat your pride and joy with care. They'll      grind off rust if there is any, burnish, and plate any size      piece in any stove metal you can get to them. Write or call      first.    </p>    <p>      Please do not plate an old stove with silver or chrome; the      former will tarnish and may melt, and the latter is too      shiny - reminiscent of 50s autos. Nickel-plating will      cost $20 and upper piece, $50 or more minimum per job. If      that is too steep, fireproof silver paint made for charcoal      grills does a fair job of approximating the soft burnish of      nickel.    </p>	<p>			<strong>The News Isn't All Bad</strong>		</p>    <p>      That's the bad news; but there is some good news on the      wood heating front.    </p>    <p>      First, if your home is equipped with a built-in brick and      mortar fireplace, you are pretty much stuck with it. But      fireplaces don't have to be air polluting and wood      wasteful. By careful fire tending, perhaps changing the      shape of the firebox, or using cast-iron fire backs, home      owners can make existing fireplaces into relatively      efficient heaters. You will find details in " Fireplaces      That Can Heat Your Home ".    </p>    <p>      Also on the bright side, there have been steady      improvements in noncatalytic, but still EPA-approved, stove      designs - the high-techs that use an insulated      firebox and engineered airflows to create a fire that is      clean and fuel efficient but turns out the heat you expect      from a stove that is fully "alive" and responsive. These      stoves are smaller and more reasonably priced than the      catalytics, as there is no converter, housing, or automated      air control to restrict draft and make the stoves operate      like robots.    </p>    <p>      Early high-tech designs were so tiny that they were barely      able to heat a small room. But at least one manufacturer,      Country Stoves (see page 98 for address), refused to follow      the catalytic converter path and has worked to develop a      line of more capable high-techs; their largest sports a      firebox measuring more than three cubic feet. That's large      enough to turn out the 70,000 BTUs per hour needed to heat      a 3,500-square-foot home. By channeling exhaust through a      superheated crucible of firebrick and ceramic fiber      blanketing, then releasing fresh air into it through      afterburners of stainless steel, holey tubing, the stoves      burn smoke so thoroughly that their emissions are cleaner      than those of many catalytics. Some models also have a      built-in heat exchanger with a blower that will circulate      heated air directly into living spaces; others feed into a      central hot air heating system's plenum for distribution      through conventional ducting.    </p>    <p>      These stoves are neither as simple nor as cheap as an old      log burner - that's nothing but an iron box with a      door at one end and a smoke hole at the other. But they are      as understandable. They burn efficiently and cleanly      because they burn hot. Their pyroclastic liner is based on      the same insulating principle used for generations to      maintain the high firebox temperatures needed to burn coal.      The high-tech's sophisticated design isn't so much high      technology as refined common sense (even if it was designed      by computer); a portion of the stove's own draft is      channeled through the firebed and another portion creates a      kind of blowtorch to force in hot, high-velocity oxygen to      burn smoke.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wood-Burning Freedoms Preserved</strong>    </p>    <p>      Stove retailers I know are convinced that the other stove      makers will follow in improving and expanding their own      high-tech lines, and we're on the way to getting our      wood-burning freedom back, folks. And isn't a sense of      freedom what wood heat is all about? Country living can't      totally free us from modern technology, the constraints of      an interdependent society, and technological economy. But a      big woodpile in back provides a sense of self-sufficiency      through a very real measure of independence from Exxon and      fossil heating fuels. It also offers a degree of      independence from the public utilities and an end to the      worry that the electricity might go out in a winter storm,      making the oil or gas furnace go dead. When government      first invited itself into the stove business, much of the      feeling of independence and freedom seemed to disappear      from wood heat. Somehow, it wasn't worth the sweat to chop      and haul wood to feed an overpriced, underperforming,      overmechanized stove all festooned with shiny tin plates      full of "bureaucratese" affirming state and federal      approval. It's kind of like when Mom, Dad, City Hall, and      the preacher all approved of the cutoff Levis, ponytails,      and weird-painted VW vans we flaunted in our youth -      it spoiled the fun.    </p>    <p>      Now the newest high-tech stoves burn as cleanly and as      economically as any older "government stove" - but      without restrictive technology. They sell at reasonable      prices and offer the wood burner all the warmth and      responsiveness of the good old predecessors. Their      performance isn't forced or artificial. They burn smartly      - and as naturally as the wood they use. You can even      snake a cleaning brush all the way through them, from door      to firebox to smoke boot and into the stovepipe -      just like any old-time wood burner. That gets Big Brother      out of the living room and puts the good feeling back into      wood heat ...at least for me.    </p>
