            		<p>				<strong>ENERGY &ENVIRONMENT</strong>    </p>    		<p><strong>Think you know about wind power? Noisy? Unreliable?      Inefficient? Well, the newest turbine generation has      finally come of age.</strong>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">		By Laurie Stone	</h5>		        <p>      <em>Mark Mein and Ellen Davis have been living with    solar-generated electricity for 10 years. They have no    utility power at their house. Instead, they have 15 solar    photovoltaic (PV) panels that provide electricity for them    and their seven-year-old son. However, the PVs alone did not    provide enough electricity during the dark midwinter period    and they found themselves grudgingly relying on their    gasoline generator from November through January. In October    of 1992, they decided to move away from this dependence on    fossil fuels and to take advantage of the other renewable    energy source they had overhead: the wind.</em>	</p>	    <p>      As Mark said, "I wanted to vote with my dollars for the      kind of energy picture I want to see in the U.S. and the      world." So Mark and Ellen bought a 1-kW wind turbine to      help out their solar system on cloudy days. While before      they might have used about 50 gallons of gasoline a year to      provide backup power, with their wind generator they use      only 20.    </p>    <p>      Their wind/PV system provides enough electricity to run      their "typical, low-energy" house. This includes lights,      TV, VCR, stereo, washing machine, refrigerator, freezer,      convection oven, water pump, hand-held power tools, and a      variety of other small appliances. Mark thinks that if they      did not have a renewable energy system at their house, they      would be burning $500â€“600 worth of gas each year.    </p>    <p>      Like Mark and Ellen, thousands of people across the country      are using wind power to generate electricity. Some of them      do it to save on utility bills, others to decrease      dependence on fossil fuels, and still others because they      have no other energy option. Together they have forged a      radical change in how wind power is perceived.    </p>    <h3>      Planes and Radios    </h3>    <p>      Wind power has been an important source of energy in the      United States for centuries. Over eight million mechanical      windmills have been installed in America since the 1860s,      and thousands are still in operation across the West. Their      main function was to pump water, not to provide the kind of      fossil fuel-replacing help that we need the most.    </p>    <p>      It wasn't until the 1920s that wind-generated electricity      took off - literally. Mick Sagrillo, president of      Lake Michigan Wind & Sun, explains that it all began      with the airplane. The propeller was discovered to be not      only an efficient way of producing thrust, but it also      drove an electrical generator far better than a mechanical      water wheel, which is very similar to what the earliest      wind generators used. As the propeller developed, so did      generating stations on the ground.    </p>    <p>      The radio was wind power's second ally in the first half of      this century. Farmers and ranchers were as dependent upon      radios for critical weather information in the 1930s as      they are today. Without grid electricity, people listened      to battery-powered radios that weren't particularly      dependable and needed frequent recharging. Each charge      meant a long trek to town and a few days with no radio.      However, a small 6-V wind generator provided enough      electricity to keep the battery continuously charged, with      power to spare. By the 1930s, wind-charged radios were hot      items across the Great Plains.    </p>    <p>      In time, the 6-V radio chargers were replaced by 32-V      generating turbines, and thousands of homes gained access      to power they had never before imagined possible. Wind      generator companies sprung up all over America. However,      with the passage of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936,      the wind industry was driven out of business. By the 1950s,      government policies favoring utility lines and fossil-fuel      plants left the wind industry crippled. With the coming of      the energy crisis in the 1970s, that trend began to      reverse. Between 1976 and 1990, over 5,000 small wind      systems were installed at individual homes in America.    </p>    <h3>      All of the People, Some of the      Time    </h3>    <p>      Wind power is a form of solar energy produced by the uneven      heating of the earth's surface. It is a highly variable      source of energy, as anyone who has failed to keep a kite      aloft or battened down for a hurricane will attest.    </p>        <p>      Although it's an energy source that is almost impossible to      regulate, wind power is democratic. Everyone gets some and      it is free to all. Nobody owns it. It is also a clean      technology, emitting no pollutants as it transforms wind      into electrical power. And it is the cheapest energy      technology we have today. In some ideal wind locations, the      cost of wind-generated electricity is just 5  cents per      kilowatt-hour. Anyone who has paid a utility bill knows      that it doesn't get much cheaper.    </p>    <p>      There are many places across the United States that are      ideal wind sites. Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, North      Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, and Minnesota offer some of the      most promising locations for wind power. South Dakota, the      "Saudi Arabia of wind energy," actually has enough wind      resources to provide half of the electricity for all of      America. There are also pockets of ideal wind sites      scattered throughout the country. You can find a place      where wind power is economical in Arizona, Florida, New      York, Vermont, and, in fact, in almost all 50 states.    </p>    <p>      Few people choose to power their entire household with the      wind. In many instances, wind blows stronger during the      winter months, leaving homesteaders to devise an      alternative generating device for the summer. Hybrid      systems, like Mark and Ellen's PV/wind system, are an ideal      solution and there are thousands like them across America.    </p>    <p>      Another hybrid system is a utility-tied configuration. In      this system there are no batteries. The utility acts as      storage. Most of your appliances are run off grid power.      However, when the wind blows, you sell energy back to the      utility. Wouldn't it be nice to receive a check from the      local utility company rather than a bill?    </p>    <h3>      The Search for Self-Sufficiency<br />By Linda Matise    </h3>    <p>      After 2 years of powering our remote home on a small      generator, my husband John and I were desperate. We had to      eliminate the noise, gasoline, oil changes, and fumes or      finally admit that what was originally envisioned as a      conscientious attempt at energy self-sufficiency was      turning into a terrific nuisance. One morning after we      stepped outside to get a soul full of fresh air and instead      caught yet another mouthful of exhaust, we contacted a      couple of wind turbine manufacturers for specifications and      wind data. Their charts and graphs, spread out over the      kitchen table, provided information about equipment      operation and wind velocity. Financial resources dictated      that we move slowly, but we were determined to get moving.    </p>        <p>      One year later, John and I enjoy a rural life-style in the      Tehachapi mountains with modern conveniences ...and no      fumes. We convert both wind and solar power to 110-V      household current. We also have a backup generator -      just in case Mother Nature takes a rest. Our primary      electrical supply is generated by a 1.5-kW Bergey wind      turbine, mounted on a 50-foot, old-fashioned, stock tank      windmill. The turbine is a 24-hour renewable source and the      solar panels complement the power system on sunny days.      During winter, solar benefts are limited by shorter days,      but the wind is present across our mountains.    </p>    <p>      Our refrigerator, heaters, and water heater run on propane      gas. On household current (stored in batteries and      transformed from 24-V DC power to 110-V AC for the house      outlets through an inverter), we operate a color TV, VCR,      computer, printer, washer, dryer, 1,500-W hair dryer, water      well and water pressure pump, garage door opener, water      filtration system, and outdoor lighting.    </p>    <p>      But how did we get there?    </p>    <p>      Our first consideration was the tower. Typically, turbine      manufacturers design their mounting plates to conform to      the tower top. For example, Bergey uses the Rohn      guyed-lattice tower, whereas World Power uses a guyed-pole      tower. What this means is that you are something of a      captive audience, having to buy a turbine specifically made      for certain towers. And they don't come cheap.    </p>    <p>      The giant steel frame must be a minimum of 50 feet tall to      reach stable air and preferably taller to ensure      unobstructed airflow. It's hoisted to an upright position      and stabilized with numerous guy wires; the turbine is then      lifted on top by a crane (only experienced folk dare use a      gin pole). The rotor and tail are installed in place and      final electrical connections are made. Now, all that's      required is a 7.5-mph start-up wind.    </p>    <p>      Maintenance schedules vary according to turbine design.      Some towers are designed to be lowered to the ground for      turbine maintenance rather than making you climb to the      top. Contrary to some manufacturers' contentions though,      lowering a 50â€“100-foot tower for any reason is no      small job. The guy wires must be released and there must be      adequate ground clearance and equipment with which to lower      it. Maintenance is best left to the qualified and brave who      are equipped with safety gear.    </p>        <p>      Now, that's how it should be done. Then there's the way we      did it. We bought a 75-year-old, 4-legged, angle-iron      windmill tower with lots of western character and no guy      wires. We constructed two pivoting legs to tilt the      tower-each in 1,500 pounds of concrete. The other two      legs locked into place (see photograph).    </p>    <p>      We ordered a World Power Whisper 1-kW turbine and modified      the tower top with a 2-inch pipe according to      specifications. We assembled, wired, and mounted the      Whisper before we raised the tower. Neighbors came to lend      a hand and we pushed it up with our tractor. We flipped it      on with ceremonious gesture - and at last it was up      and working! Well, Murphy (and his Law) apparently had      taken residence at our place. The blades were out of      balance and the generator was shimmying...a lot.    </p>    <p>      We ordered a new set of blades and installed them without      lowering the tower. Now it spun smoothly and we had more      electricity than we could use - until 3 months later,      when we spotted the tail lying on the ground and noticed      that the nose cone was cracked. We learned that World Power      previously had problems with the tail and nose cone design.      They offered to replace the turbine , but we felt the      Whisper just wasn't up to the challenge. We lowered the      tower, removed the turbine, and shipped it back. World      Power refunded our money. Based upon this experience, we      always recommend that anyone who is considering a wind      turbine ask the manufacturer for references for people who      have had that model turbine in service for a couple of      years in a location with similar wind conditions.    </p>    <p>      Taking our own advice, we located Ed Wulf, a nearby      resident who had a Bergey. He said it would "withstand our      brand of wind." After much conversation, we ordered      Bergey's BWC 1500, a 1.5-kW wind-power generator. It has      three blades for better balance and turns out of the wind      at 120 mph. This time around, we had the tower top      configured by a technician who maintains 600-kW commercial      turbines atop 160-foot towers. He also assembled and      installed the turbine.    </p>    <p>      We built an outbuilding beside the tower to house the      energy system. John designed it and had an electrician wire      it to meet California's building code. Power generated by      the turbine is processed through a controller and stored in      a 24-V DC, deep-cycle battery array. From the batteries, a      sine wave inverter supplies our 3,100-square-foot home and      a 1,200-square-foot garage with 110-V AC electricity.    </p>    <p>      When the batteries are fully charged, power can be manually      diverted to start the well pump to top off the 5,000-gallon      water storage tank. If the inverter fails, a manual breaker      switch automatically shifts to the generator. The system      also operates a water filtration system.    </p>    <p>      The batteries are isolated in a well-vented, fire-walled      room within the power center. Lead acid batteries are the      weakest link of any alternative energy system; technology      has simply not advanced to produce an affordable,      long-lasting battery.    </p>    <p>      Our system is more than adequate, but this does not mean      that it has no limitations. We are careful to turn lights      off and wash only full loads of laundry. I sometimes iron      clothes at midnight because that's when the excess power is      available. But we have developed a sixth sense about our      output capabilities ties. We even enjoy 27-W fluorescent      lights (equivalent to a 100-W incandescent bulb),      low-voltage garden lights, and motion detectors.    </p>    <p>      The cost for our hybrid system is about $10,000. Yes, it's      a lot of money, but we didn't spend it all at once. We      began with a 5-kW generator, inverter, and batteries. When      we could afford it, we upgraded to a 10-kW generator. Then      we bought the windmill and gradually added PV panels.    </p>    <p>      Statistics indicate that the operating cost of a 1,500-W      wind system is $1.93 per watt. But the payoff for      nonpolluting electricity cannot be equated in dollars. Its      value is realized in terms of self-sufficiency and quality      of life.    </p>    <h3>      From Breeze to Batteries    </h3>    <p>      A turbine converts the wind into electrical power. It      consists of propellerlike blades (the rotor) and a      generator. The rotor is what captures the energy of the      wind and converts it into motion to drive the generator. A      properly designed rotor turns the generator fast enough to      produce maximum power but not so fast that it presents a      danger to the system.    </p>    <p>      A turbine must have a clear shot at the wind, so a      well-designed tower is crucial for an effective system.      Building too short a tower is the most common mistake home      owners make. The higher one goes above ground, the stronger      and "smoother" the wind is. Smoother air means air that is      free from the turbulence that occurs from obstructions such      as trees and buildings. It is <em>always</em> a better      investment to get more tower instead of a larger wind      turbine. Mark feels that if he had gone only 20 or 30 feet      higher in his 70-foot tower, he could almost double the      output of the generator. As a rule of thumb, the tower      should be at least 30 feet above any obstacles within 500      feet.    </p>    <p>      Before you run out and install a tower on your roof,      cleverly thinking that you can cut 30 feet off your tower      height, remember that towers vibrate <em>a</em>      <em>lot</em> . The vibrations could seriously damage both      your house and your nerves. Wind towers should always be      installed on the ground.    </p>    <p>      Since the wind does not always blow when you want to listen      to your stereo, an "off-grid" system typically includes      turbine-charged batteries so that electricity is available      at any time throughout the day, plus a regulator to protect      the batteries from overcharging. A battery system will      usually also have an inverter to change the DC electricity      from the turbine and batteries into AC electricity that      most of our appliances consume.    </p>    <h3>      Windy Enough for You?    </h3>    <p>      How much power is available from the wind? The main factor      is speed. In 1927 Alfred Betz of Germany computed a formula      for how much power the wind can generate. He concluded that      the power in the wind is proportional to the cube of the      wind speed. For example, if the wind speed doubles, the      available power increases eightfold. That is, a 20-mph wind      will yield eight times the power of a 10-mph one.    </p>    <p>      Another important factor in the amount of power possible is      the area of the rotor. A larger rotor will intercept a      larger area of wind, thus providing more power. Although we      do have control over what size rotor we use, we don't have      control over the wind speed. So it is essential to know how      much wind is necessary for a wind system to be practical.    </p>    <p>      Since wind speeds change constantly (changes of up to 30      mph are possible in 5 seconds or less), it is important to      talk of average wind speeds. Areas with average monthly      wind speeds of 12 to 16 mph or above are excellent wind      sites. For a utility-tied system, speeds of 9 mph or above      are economical. Finally, for places where there is no      utility and wind is your only option, areas with very low      wind speeds might still be more economical than relying on      a diesel generator.    </p>    <p>      How do you know what your average wind speed is? Although      wind speed data are easily accessible for many locations      throughout the United States, it might not be accurate for      home wind applications. Most of the wind data are collected      at airports, which are generally built in places with the      least amount of wind. According to Mick, "unless you live      in a hole or the middle of the woods, you can expect at      least a 1- to 4-mph increase above airport data." If you      have any doubts, do a little studying on your own.      Anemometers can measure wind speed at any location (and      some simple hand-held models can be purchased for as little      as $15). They should be positioned as high as the wind      system tower will be. To get an estimate of your average      wind speed, you can measure your site twice a day for 2      weeks. Then call the local weather bureau and find a ratio      between your readings and their daily measurements. You can      then extrapolate to estimate your wind site year-round.      Once the average wind speed is known, it is a simple matter      to determine how much energy is available to you.    </p>    <p>      But that is only half of the equation. You also need to      know how much energy you use. And for a wind system (or any      renewable energy system, for that matter) to be practical,      it is necessary to use energy efficiently. That means no      electric stove, electric water heater, or electric clothes      dryer. Solar thermal energy or propane makes more sense for      those applications. You can run the majority of your      current appliances, but energy-efficient models will be of      tremendous assistance in the long run. Reducing your need      for electricity will do more than anything else in making      your system affordable.    </p>    <h3>      Paying for Power    </h3>    <p>      Once the wind system is up and running, your utility bills      will be substantially lower, or even nonexistent. However,      energy doesn't come free. Like any other renewable energy      device, the cost of the equipment, or the first cost, is      what will dig into your wallet. Mark and Ellen's 1-kW      system costs about $4,500. A third of the cost was the      turbine, a third was the tower and installation, and the      last third was miscellaneous hardware. They were lucky in      that they had the batteries and inverter already in their      PV system.    </p>    <p>      However, a typical 500 â€“ 600-W system can run about      $6,000, an amount nearly equivalent to that of a similar      solar stand-alone system. The wind turbine will be between      $800 and $1,000; the tower, up to $3,000; the batteries,      $800 to $1,600; and the inverter, controller, and wiring,      $1,000 to $2,000. A utility-tied system will be even      cheaper because it doesn't require batteries.    </p>    <p>      Six grand worth of up-front costs is a considerable sum,      but it is crucial to take into consideration that in 6 or 7      years the amount of money saved from not paying utility      bills will pay for the entire system. After that, the      investment will yield nothing but savings. Better yet,      maintenance costs for modern generators are very low, and      the "fuel" is free. Depending upon the type chosen,      batteries will need to be replaced approximately every 10      years.    </p>    <p>      In remote locations where there is no utility, the payback      will come even sooner. Faced with the overwhelming cost of      extending grid power to a remote home (see "Living off the      Grid," issues #141â€“143), it is usually cheaper to      install a independent or hybrid wind system at a relatively      good wind site than to extend the transmission lines or      rely on a diesel generator. And, of course, the      satisfaction of generating your own electricity from a      nonpolluting energy source has no price value.    </p>    <p>      Remember that wind power does have some practical      considerations. In the past, turbines were noisy.      Fortunately, the newer turbines are quieter. Today, noise      is rarely a problem in house-sized systems. And wind      turbines are definitely quieter than listening to a      generator all day.    </p>    <p>      It is also hard to ignore the visual impact. Many people do      not want to look out their windows and see their neighbor's      wind tower. But how many of us have become accustomed to      the plethora of utility lines outside of our windows and      above our heads every day? To many, a wind tower is a      beautiful symbol of energy independence, a sculpture in      motion.    </p>    <p>      Wind machines are not for everyone, however. Not only is it      a mechanical device that occasionally needs maintenance,      but it is a mechanical device that is very high up in the      air. If the idea of climbing a 100-foot tower once or twice      a year sends you groping for the Dramamine, you might want      to reconsider your energy options. But if you have a      maintenance contract with a local wind dealer, you can      enjoy your system from the safety of the ground. A tilt-up      tower is another option. You can lower your tower to do any      work or inspection and tilt it back up without lifting a      foot.    </p>    <h3>      What About the Law?    </h3>    <p>      Before you put up your wind tower, you should research      zoning ordinances, building codes, and any legal      requirements that might affect your installation.    </p>    <p>      Some ordinances have height restrictions and setback      requirements (the minimum distance a structure can be from      the property line). These stumbling blocks can generally be      overcome. You might have to apply for a variance or      convince people that a wind system should be classified      under the same category as communication towers for TVs,      CBs, and ham radios. Either way, do your homework and find      out the hurdles that must be overcome before buying your      tower.    </p>    <h3>      Putting Up the System    </h3>    <p>      Now that you have measured your site, picked out the right      system, and obtained any necessary permits, you are ready      to get your system up and running. The easiest thing to do      is call your local Mick Sagrillo and have a trained crew do      the work for you. Installing the tower, raising the wind      generator on top of it, wiring the system, and installing      the batteries is not a simple weekend project.    </p>    <p>      Mick, however, has no qualms about people installing their      own system. In fact, he encourages it: "If you get your      hands dirty, you have more vested interest in making sure      it works properly." However, he discourages people from      building their own tower. The tower is a critical component      and a poorly built one can actually be deadly.    </p>    <p>      There are various ways to put the actual wind generator in      place. You can use a crane or a gin pole, which is a small      crane that attaches to the top of the tower. The generator      is usually raised first and the rotor and tail vane follow.      Once the generator is in place, it must be checked to see      if it is level and the rotor blades are tracking properly.      If the unit is out of balance it will vibrate, increasing      noise and losing power. However you put up your system, it      is strongly recommended that you work with an expert. A      poorly installed or wired system can mean major damage in      the first big wind.    </p>    <p>      Once your system is operating, maintenance is minimal. Mark      climbs his 70-foot tower twice a year to lubricate and      inspect the generator ("not the most pleasant task"). You      can do this yourself or hire a local dealer. In an off-grid      system, the batteries will need some attention. They must      be checked periodically and you may need to add distilled      water to them a couple times a year.    </p>    <p>      But to the thousands of people living with wind systems,      this is a small price to pay. And once your system is      spinning that wind into electricity, you might think      differently the next time you feel a cool breeze or even a      strong gale. That gust of air means that the days of      needless and spiraling utility expenses are over.    </p>    <h3>      For more information    </h3>    <p>      <strong><em>Workshops:</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Solar Energy International, P.O.
