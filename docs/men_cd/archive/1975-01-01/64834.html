                    <h5 id="byline">     by JOHN WELLS    </h5>      <p>      OF ALL THE SKILLS USED ON A MODERN HOMESTEAD, WELDING IS      ALWAYS ONE OF THE MOST IN DEMAND. IT'S ALSO FAR TOO MUCH OF      AN "ART" TO TEACH TO ANYONE IN A FEW PAGES OF ONE ISSUE OF      THIS OR ANY OTHER MAGAZINE. THE FOLLOWING TWO ARTICLES,      THEN, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS INTRODUCTIONS TO WELDING      . . . A VALUABLE SKILL WHICH-ONCE MASTERED-CAN GO A      LONG WAY TOWARD PAYING FOR THAT "LITTLE DREAM PLACE OUT IN      THE COUNTRY" AND PUTTING BREAD-EVEN TODAY'S EXPENSIVE      BREAD!-ON THE TABLE.    </p>    <p>      My career as a metalworker began a few years ago, when I      was looking for a job out in Arizona. A friend of      mine-a welder and the foreman of a shop in      Tucson-offered to teach me his trade so I could apply for      work with the same outfit. I accepted his offer . . . and      that skill turned out to be one of the best I could have      learned.    </p>    <p>      One obvious benefit is that I now make my living as a      welder and have supported my family that way for several      years. But that's not all! Life on our homestead has become      a heck of a lot easier since I've mastered this craft. I've      added all kinds of low-cost improvements, from scrap-steel      ash shovels, pokers and other tools for our wood stove      through a whole range of other repair and construction      projects.    </p>    <p>      Take hammers, for example. Every homestead needs a few      decent ones, both nail and ball-peen . . . but if I bought      them from the hardware store I'd end up spending at least      five bucks apiece. As a welder, though, I can scrounge an      old auto axle and cut it to the desired size for the tool's      head. Axle steel is about the hardest to be found anywhere,      and just right for that purpose. Of course I may have to      temper the metal some, but I simply put a little      blacksmithing knowledge to work and end up with a fine      implement (free, if I choose to make my own handle). Many      other tools can also be made by hand . . . the      homesteader's own needs will determine which ones he      tackles.    </p>    <p>      In addition, we've saved hundreds of dollars by repairing      and/or rebuilding rusted-out auto and truck bodies. Several      years ago, for instance, I bought a 1960 Ford pickup for      $100. Its bed was so badly eaten away that I had      reservations about hauling around my spare tire back there      for fear I'd lose it out the holes. My solution was to tear      off the original Detroit sheet metal bed and build a very      efficient wooden stake body using homemade hardware formed      from scrap steel. All I really needed to buy were a few      half-inch bolts.<br />      <br />      As a bonus from my truck repair project, the old rusted bed      has been recycled into various other jobs which required      small pieces of auto-body sheet steel. Such scrap is very      useful for thousands of homestead needs . . . and it's      <em>free.</em> Virtually every old farm up here in Maine      has, on the average, at least half a dozen junked cars,      trucks and tractors.    </p>    <p>      Building is another field where skill as a welder can pay      off. Large domes-both for housing and for work      space-have been constructed entirely from recycled free      junk metal. In many instances, steel structures can be      erected, by selective salvaging and scavenging, at a      fraction of the cost of their wood counterparts.    </p>    <p>      Now. If I've sold you on the idea of learning to weld, you      may be wondering how much you'd have to invest in      equipment. Maybe less than you think: You can buy a fine      electric arc welding machine, brand new, for $100. (To use      it, of course, you'll have to have either a 220-volt outlet      or else a good 5-kilowatt generator.)<br />    </p>    <p>      The other form of welding-the, oxyacetylene      process-is fueled by the combined burning of two gases,      acetylene (two parts hydrogen and two parts carbon) and      oxygen. Each is housed in its own separate tank (the      taller, more slender green container holds oxygen). The      fuels are brought together by two hoses running from the      tanks to a torch tip, and are mixed in certain proportions      in order to produce a super-hot flame. Temperatures between      5,000° and 6,500° F are reached: high enough to      melt quarter-inch-thick steel in about seven seconds.    </p>    <p>      Electric are welding is really a good bit cheaper in the      long run than oxyacetylene, since the price of electricity      is still a "bargain" compared to the cost of fuels for the      other process. You really need both setups in conjunction,      however, because you'll find oxyacetylene very handy for      various purposes . . . including any brazing you have to      do. (Brazing is the method of joining metals by means of a      filler rod made of copper and zinc. The parts to be unified      are not melted, as they are in welding . . . only the      filler is liquefied to form the bond. The process is      similar to soldering, and is generally used on items such      as broken mufflers and tailpipes that are too thin to be      arc welded effectively. Auto body men use brazing to repair      damaged or rusted sheet metal.)<br />    </p>    <p>      Oxyacetylene is also a practical way to cut steel . . . an      alternative to investing in a power hacksaw. The item to be      cut is first made red-hot, and the oxygen valve is then      pressed to produce a blast of gas which literally blows      away the molten metal.    </p>    <p>      If you own an old blacksmith's forge, of course, it's quite      a bit cheaper to fire it up with coal and cut the red-hot      steel with a good cold chisel than it is to use      oxyacetylene. In many instances, however, the old method      takes considerable time to set up (because of such matters      as getting the coals red-hot and looking for pieces of      steel small enough to fit into the forge). A combination of      the traditional blacksmith's art and the modern      oxyacetylene method is really best for the homesteader who      wants to become self-sufficient in the metal crafts.<br />    </p>    <p>      If you decide to acquire gas welding equipment, check out      machinery auctions for the best buys on used items. <em>(As      far as I can determine, a now welding and cutting      apparatus-with accessories but minus gas      tanks-now runs $150 and up-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      OK, let's say you just went out and bought an oxyacetylene      outfit and are about to use it for the first time. Before      you do anything else, make sure you have on heavy leather      welders' gloves and that your <em>shaded</em> goggles are      on your forehead. Too many good craftsmen have destroyed      their eyesight by not wearing such glasses for oxyacetylene      work.<br />    </p>    <p>      You should also see that the two gas tanks are <em>very      securely</em> fastened to their handtruck, or attached to      the wall with a good strong chain. The oxygen is under high      pressure and acetylene is extremely combustible, so be      careful not to let the containers fall. And remember,      <em>absolutely no smoking</em> around oxyacetylene      equipment.    </p>    <p>      Before using the outfit, it's always a good idea to open      the valve on each tank at least a quarter turn in order to      blow out any dust or dirt that may have collected on the      fittings. This step is called "cracking the tanks".    </p>    <p>      (After a while, incidentally, you'll learn what pure      acetylene smells like. This will help you locate any leaks      in your equipment. The soapsuds method is about the best      way to check for escaping gas when you hook up fresh tanks.      Make sure the torch valves are closed and the tank valves      open during this test.)    </p>    <p>      Next, hook up the regulators. The oxygen connections have      right-hand threads, while those for the acetylene are      left-handed. The green hose is for oxygen, the red for      acetylene. (You can remember the difference by associating      "red" with "fire".) Secure all fittings with an open-end      wrench . . . not the adjustable or crescent type, which has      a habit of chewing the daylights out of the brass      connections.    </p>    <p>      Welding is carried out at various pressures according to      the work to be done. For steel 1/8" to 3/8" thick, I      usually run the acetylene to the hose at about 7 to 10 psi      (pounds per square inch). The oxygen is held at about 25 to      30 psi, since an oxygen-acetylene ratio of between three to      one and five to one is the general rule.    </p>    <p>      Here's how to set pressure: Open the valves on the      regulators by screwing them all the way out (make sure      those on the torch are closed). Then open the valves on the      gas containers until the regulators' tank pressure gauges      'register "medium". The point when this is reached will      vary according to the surrounding temperature: The pressure      in the receptacles will be higher at 80° than at      50°. To get hose pressure, screw in the regulator valve      until the desired psi value is reached.    </p>    <p>      The next step is to light the torch. Open the oxygen inlet      valve (the one closest to the green hose) all the way, but      make sure the oxygen preheat valve-the one way up on      the torch near the cutting lever-is open only about a      quarter turn. Have your goggles down and your gloves on.      Pick up the striker and open the acetylene stopcock about      half a turn just before igniting the gases at the torch      tip. <em>Be sure the business end of the unit is pointed      away from you, from anyone else and from all flammable      objects.</em>    </p>		            <p>      You must then balance the acetylene with the oxygen to      produce the "neutral" flame which is ideal for cutting (see      Fig.1). Adjust the acetylene control on the torch-try      closing it an eighth of a turn or so-and you'll      notice how the smoky orange flare decreases, giving way to      the cleaner neutral flame. Adjustments to the cutting and      preheat valves will give further<br />      refinement. The whole idea is to keep the inner cone      closest to the torch tip burning in such a way      that-when the cutting lever is pressed-this      central portion doesn't change length. It's a good idea to      have an experienced welder show you exactly what the      correct flame should look like . . . words can go only so      far.<br />    </p>    <p>      Once you've got the flame adjusted, place the torch tip so      that the inner cone is about one-eighth of an inch from the      piece of steel to be cut. When the area turns red-hot,      press down on the oxygen cutting lever and blow away the      molten metal in the strong stream of gas. The torch is best      kept at an angle of about 600 to the work, with the tip      pointing in the direction of travel. Moving it too fast      will result in no cut. (I hope these hints help      <em>you,</em> but a good, clean job comes only with      experience.)    </p>    <p>      As an aid to neat work you can draw a guideline on the      metal with a soapstone marker, available at any welding      supply store. When making longer cuts-say anything over 10      inches-I usually clamp a rugged piece of angle iron      next to the intended line and run the torch along its back      edge for a nice, accurate result.<br />    </p>    <p>      After the piece has been cut, it's good practice to knock      the slag from the edge with a, cold chisel and ball-peen      hammer. Finish the work with a grinder for a smooth,      machined appearance.    </p>      <p>      Fine! Your special piece of steel is down to size and      you're ready to fabricate that certain part you need to      repair the cultivator. It's time to fire up the arc-welding      machine.<br />    </p>    <p>      Once again, the rule is "safety first" . . . and that means      a good Fiber-Metal helmet (a must because the ultraviolet      rays produced by the arc-welding process are dangerous to      your eyes and to any exposed skin). The headpiece should be      fitted with at least a No. 12 shade lens, and it's also a      good idea to add two clear plastic lenses . . . one in      front of the shaded plate, the other behind it. The purpose      of these extra barriers is to protect the expensive colored      shield from metallic splatter. I prefer plastic to glass      because it's less easily damaged by smoke and flying metal      drops.    </p>    <p>      It's, also advisable to wear heavy leather gloves and      preferably a fireproof shirt or jacket. Try to avoid      dressing in ragged, fringed jeans! I've had several such      garments start smoldering in the course of welding jobs. If      you can afford them, leather pants are best for this kind      of work.<br />    </p>    <p>      Ready? Set your machine to the correct amperage for the      meal's thickness and the size of welding rod you intend to      use (see Chart B). The box the rod comes in will indicate      the best beat range for each type. (Personally, I prefer      Eutectic brand . . . the best available, according to my      own experience and the advice of other welders.)    </p>    <p>      Connect the ground cable to the welding job, fairly near      the intended join but far enough away that it won't      interfere with the work. Place the rod in the grooves of      the electrode holder, turn on the machine and you're ready      to strike the arc.    </p>    <p>      A caution: I can't overemphasize the importance of making      yaw helmet falls down over your face <em>before</em> the      arc is struck. If the straps are properly adjusted, a good      healthy nod will bring down the head covering at the right      moment. It's not always convenient to rely on your other      hand for this purpose, because you'll generally be using it      to hold the job in place.<br />    </p>    <p>      Now. Your helmet is <em>down,</em> right? Go ahead and      produce an arc by scratching the rod over about an inch and      a half of the area to be welded, and then lifting the      electrode about a quarter inch from the work. Try to keep      the instrument at about 20 to 30 degrees from vertical,      with the hot tip pointing in the direction of travel . . .      assuming, that is, you're doing a horizontal, flat weld.      For vertical or overhead flat work, keep the tip aimed      opposite to the direction of travel (that is, toward the      point where you began).    </p>    <p>      Once the arc has been started, your goal is to mix the two      pieces of steel together with the aid of the melting rod in      order to produce a solid weld. To achieve this, it's best      to move the tip in a circular, oscillating pattern. Keep      the "circles" about a quarter inch in diameter, with the      horizontal axis of each oscillation exactly on the joint.      Every movement should overlap the last just a little. (See      Fig. 2 for a diagram of the technique.)    </p>    <p>      This oscillation method is the one that works best for me,      but practice is needed to learn the most comfortable and      effective wrist and hand action. You'd do well to have an      experienced welder show you the proper motion.    </p>    <p>      After the pieces have been joined, it's sometimes necessary      to remove all the remaining slag that covers the finished      weld bead. This is a must whenever a second line of welding      is to be laid down next to or on top of the first . . . and      it's a good idea in any case, as a check for solidity,      since air pockets can sometimes be discovered in the      process. The cleaning can be done with either a regular      cold chisel or a chipping hammer with a wire brush.    </p>    <p>      There, in brief, you have the basics of welding, and any      homesteader will find them worth his while to learn. Well      worth the cost of equipment, too. The several hundred      dollars you put into a complete outfit will be more than      repaid in a few years, especially if you own trucks or farm      machinery. If you break part of your harrow out in the      field, hiring a welder from a town 30 miles away can be a      costly affair (assuming you can find such a person at all).      Up here in the backwoods, metalworkers earn at least $6.00      per hour. That's bad news if you have to pay for the      service. If you can do the work yourself, though, you can      save all kinds of money on your own place . . . and you'll      also have the basis for a homestead business that's hard to      beat.    </p>       <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>   <p>      The following are some helpful books on welding and metal      shop craft:    </p>    <p>      <em>Modern Welding by Althouse, Turnquist and Bowditch,      Good-heart-Willcox Co., 123 W.
