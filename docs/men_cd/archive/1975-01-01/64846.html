                    <h2 id="subtitle">     "Prepare Now For Survival"    </h2>        <p>      MOTHER's readers won't survive long if they take the advice      in "Prepare Now for Survival" (MOTHER NO. 29).    </p>    <p>      The author recommends storing grain with diatomaceous earth      "from a pool supply firm". Don't do it! Diatomaceous earth      is prepared for use in pool filters by a heat treatment      which changes its molecular structure to a form of silica.      The sharp silica spikes readily pierce the bodies of      insects and their larvae . . . <em>also human      intestines</em> Pet animals "dusted carefully" with this      product would lose their lives along with their fleas.    </p>    <p>      Kris Torrey's suggestion <em>is</em> valid, however, for      the natural, untreated form of diatomaceous earth. Its      carbonaceous molecular structure is deadly to insects but      safe for consumption by humans, dogs, cats and chickens.      When mixed with chicken-feed, for instance, this substance      passes unchanged through the bird's digestive tract and is      deposited in the feces . . . where it then kills the flies      and larvae that attempt to breed in the waste. It works.    </p>    <p>      Untreated diatomaceous earth, I'm sorry to say, does cost      571 per pound at our local natural food store . . . but is      much cheaper bought by the hundredweight.    </p>       <p>      <strong>Joanne Ross<br />      Nevada City, Calif.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many thanks, Joanne, for passing on this warning. Until we      have more information on the whole question,      diatomaceous-earth products should definitely be used only      as directed on the packages in which they're shipped.    </p>    <p>      Perma-Guard Corporation, 1701 E. Elwood St., Phoenix, Ariz.      85050, manufactures diatomite preparations in various      forms, including garden and household insecticides and a      dusting powder for animals. I've consulted J. Mullin,      Nurseryman , 1173 Doylestown Pike, Quakertown, Pa. 18951 (a      distributor of Perma-Guard products), and received his      assurance that these items are perfectly safe if used as      directed. Mr. Mullin also mentioned that he ships large      quantities of Fossil Flour-a diatomaceous additive      for livestock feed-to dairymen, kennel owners and      many other customers who find it an excellent method of      pest control.    </p>    <p>      Readers who want to experiment with diatomaceous      earth-in its harmless forms only, of      course-will find a list of additional uses in the      following letter from Kris Torrey.-MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Since MOTHER has received many inquiries about diatomaceous      earth (mentioned in my article "Prepare Now for Survival",      MOTHER NO. 29), I'd like to share some additional      information on the subject.    </p>    <p>      Diatomaceous earth, or diatomite, is an organic miracle.      It's composed of millions of skeletons of marine algae and      appears white and powdery like baking soda, but a bit      finer. I first discovered it a year ago through an article      entitled "The Livestock Feed Idea that Stops Flies"      (Organic Gardening and Farming, October 1973) . . . and      since that time I've found many more uses than the author,      Marion Wilbur, listed.    </p>    <p>      Besides feeding diatomite to chickens, goats, dogs, horses,      etc., as a means of controlling flies attracted to their      droppings, I've spread it with livestock bedding material      and dusted it on hen roosts and in nest boxes. I've also      applied it to rosebushes and artichoke plants to discourage      aphids. Be forewarned: The dust kills praying mantises and      ladybugs too . . . and it's not a good idea to get it in      your eyes, especially if you wear contact lenses.    </p>    <p>      In addition, my friends and I have used diatomaceous earth      in cat litter pans, on dogs and cats as flea powder and in      rugs for the same purpose. The powder controls flies and      odor in outhouses, deodorizes drains, prevents insect      activity in stored wheat (whether in sealed or unsealed      containers) and kills ants in their hills and slugs in the      garden. And it comes in handy for all sorts of other      purposes: as scouring powder, to cover the bottoms of      birdcages or tuck away in potato bins, as a shoe deodorizer      and as a moth preventer in clothing storage areas.    </p>    <p>      Here are some uses we haven't tried: crab and bedbug cure,      dry shampoo, ashtray deodorizer (no one smokes), kitchen      grease-fire extinguisher and insecticide dust for fruit      trees.    </p>    <p>      For small jobs, the powder can be applied successfully from      a can with a soft, round, clean, dry paintbrush, or from a      sack of loose-weave material used as a rosin bag. One      friend made an effective atomizer from a plastic squeeze      bottle held at the proper angle . . . it's good for dusting      large areas like gardens and rugs.    </p>    <p>      Hope this helps someone.    </p>     <p>      <strong>Kris Torrey<br /></strong> <strong>LaVerne,      Calif.</strong>    </p>
