                            <p>      If you've got a wood or coal-burning stove these days      you've got a problem. Coal just ain't what it used to be      (cheap!) and good wood sometimes can be hard to come by . .      . even though it does grow on trees. So how can you keep      the home fires burning? Go digging. For peat's sake.    </p>    <p>      Peat is so common in the United States and Canada that most      people can't see the resource for looking at it. There are      an estimated eighty million acres of deposit; right here in      the continental U.S. Most of this vast natural supply goes      unused . . . although some people do throw a few bushels of      the muck on their gardens for fertilizer and others use the      more fibrous and mossy varieties as a dressing for      flowerbeds. What most folks don't know, however, is that      peat can be a clean-burning, efficient and low-cost fuel!    </p>    <p>      Last summer I often passed a swamp where a man was digging      muck for sale as topsoil. I wondered if the wet material      could be the "peat" I had heard was used for fuel in other      parts of the world . . . so I obtained a few hundred pounds      and dried it. The idea worked! Once lit, the chunks glowed      like charcoal and gave off gases that burned with a      flickering blue flame!    </p>    <p>      Peat is nothing more than partially decayed and compacted      vegetable matter which-over a period of      time-has accumulated where soil is wet enough to      retard oxidation. Its color and consistency can be black      and mucky or brown and fibrous or anything in between.      Individual moors, bogs, swamps and shallow ponds each      produce their own "copyrighted" variety of the material. In      fact, varying types of peat are often found in      layers-each formed as a result of a change in climate      or vegetation-within the same marsh. You might even      discover that the "turf" differs from one area of a single      bed to another . . . and the bed itself might be a few      inches to several feet deep. In its natural state, peat is      around 95% water by weight (most of which must be dried out      before burning) and frequently contains some sand.    </p>    <p>      The fuel value of peat has been utilized in Europe since      the days of the ancient Greeks and Romans . . . so long, as      a matter of fact, that the substance has undoubtedly played      an important role in the development of western      civilization. Large amounts were "coked" and used to power      automobiles (run on carbon monoxide-producing generators)      shortly after World War [I. Today's rural Europeans still      heat their homes with peat, and in Eastern Europe the fuel      is even used to fire thermal power plants. The Soviet Union      alone consumes as much as sixty million tons a year!    </p>    <p>      Most peat is used close to the bogs from which it comes.      Its energy potential per pound is no higher than wood and      peat has only half the Btu value of coal. Production costs      (on a large scale) are therefore high when compared to the      fossil fuels, and long-distance transportation of the      material is economically impractical. The resource is      competitive, however, where other fuels are unavailable or      just too blamed expensive. Peat is most frequently used by      farmers who have beds of the material on their land and who      can harvest the fuel merely for the labor of digging and      drying.    </p>    <p>      Many more folks than do can burn peat today. Granted, there      are probably some exceptionally dry areas where the      material just can't be found . . . but not many. All it      takes to extract the treasure is a sharp eye, some time and      a little effort.    </p>    <p>      Harvesting peat is as ecologically sound as cutting wood      for the firebox. Moderation is obviously the key . . . you      shouldn't dig up an entire peat bed any sooner than you      should level a forest with a chain saw. Just take what you      need and use all you take. Remember: This fuel      resource-like trees-is renewable. As long as a      peat bed is kept sufficiently wet, vegetable matter will      accumulate and new peat will continue to form.    </p>    <p>      OK. Let's assume you've tromped around for a while and all      of a sudden-amuck-you're up to your boots in      peat Congratulations! You've found your fuel supply!    </p>    <p>      If the bed is solid enough-or if you can manage to      drain it somewhat so the peat is more accessible-you can      cut the material into blocks with a shovel. Then you just      stack the chunks and lot them dry. Sometimes-when the      slabs of turf are especially wet-they should be left      lying on the surface of the bed to partially dry before      they're stacked.    </p>    <p>      There are any number of variations to this harvesting      procedure and, with a little experience, you'll find the      technique that works best for you. The whole idea is simply      to remove the peat in some methodical manner and dry the      material to a point where the chunks will ignite.    </p>    <p>      Peat burns pretty much the same as wood or coal and the      general principles are the same: Start with a hot blaze of      kindling and small pieces of wood, and place the dried fuel      on top. The carbon monoxide, alcohols, acetone,, acetic      acid, methane and what-have-you-contained in burning      vegetable matter shouldn't be wasted or allowed to drift      off into the air (in consideration for your neighbor's      lungs). If the fire is given ,too much draft the      temperature in the stove is lowered, the peat burns poorly      and most of the heat goes up the chimney . . . along with      everything else. If there's not enough air, of course, the      fire suffers from lack of oxygen and the energy value of      your fuel is more or less frittered away. A little practice      makes perfect. The blocks I had contained 50% sand but      burned anyway!    </p>    <p>      Peat is by no means a total answer to the world's energy      problems . . . but it could be a partial answer (at least!)      to your own how-to-heat-the-home needs. The fuel is clean,      natural and ecologically sound. There is a great amount of      the material here in the area where I live (Leominster,      Massachusetts) and I can get a good supply for nearly      nothing. I'm going to explore its use even further!    </p>
