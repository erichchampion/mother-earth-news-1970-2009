                 <h2 id="subtitle">Independence on a 5-Acre Farm    </h2>    <p>Copyright © 1973 by John and Sally Seymour.    Introduction copyright © 1973 Shocken Books, Inc.</p>    <p><strong>Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Two years ago, when    there were <em>NO</em> currently relevant small-scale-farming    introductory handbooks available, many of us welcomed the    publication of Richard Langer's <em>Grow It!</em> with open    arms. Now that we're all older and more experienced, however,    some folks find it increasingly easy to criticize that    breakthrough beginner's guide (see the   <em>Feedback</em> sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24 and    25).</strong></p>   <p><strong>Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is just as    important (probably more so) now as <em>Grow It!</em> was two    years ago . . . and which may well come up for its share of    criticism in another 24 months or so.</strong>0</p>    <p>    <strong>Be that as it may, John and Sally Seymour's record of 18    successful years on a shirttail-sized homestead in England is    important now and should offer welcome encouragement to    today's back-to-the-landers . . . both real and imaginary. I    started serializing the book in my No. 25 issue and I'm sure    that many readers will want a personal copy for their home    libraries.-MOTHER.</strong></p>    <h3>MEAT</h3>    <p><em>The running to the butcher's dally Is a ridiculous    thing.</em></p>    <h3>WILLIAM COBBETT</h3>    <p>And a very expensive thing as well.</p>    <h3>BEEF</h3>    <p>      We send an ox a year to the slaughterhouse. The      slaughterhouse charges about eight dollars to kill it but      they pay us eight dollars for the skin so this doesn't cost      us anything, but there is the carriage in there and the      fetching of the meat back.    </p>    <p>      We could kill the meat here of course. I have killed      several bullocks in Africa and shot and cut up many a wild      buffalo which is almost exactly the same thing. But to kill      an ox you need a clean airy building which is high enough      to hang him up in, and the means for hauling him up. After      all, a very big ox <em>can</em> weigh a ton. I know a      farmer who gets the butcher to come and kill his bullocks      for him, in his hay barn, and he hoists the carcase up with      the fore-end loader of his tractor.    </p>    <p>      You can only consider killing an ox in the winter of course      (in Africa the meat had to feed thirty or forty people so      it didn't have to keep). And really the individual family      can only consider killing, or having killed, an ox if there      is a deep freeze. A family without one might conceivably      cope with one quarter of an ox, so if there were four      families in some sort of community, or at least in liaison      with each other, and no deep freeze, an ox might be killed      between them occasionally, but they would then have to salt      a lot Salt beef is all very well but, like the sailors of      old, one can have too much of it.    </p>    <p>      We kill our ox when he is too young to die. The reason for      this is that if he were, say, a three-year-old ox he would      be too big to go in our deep freeze. It would be far better      if we had a neighbour who also wanted to kill an ox every      year. We could then take alternate years to kill our ox,      and let him grow to three years at least and four years      preferably and fat him as a bullock should be fattened. The      sort of two-year-old or eighteen -month -old 'beef' that is      sold nowadays is not proper beef at all. If you ever do get      a roasting joint from a well fatted four-year-old animal,      hung until it is a deep red colour and has a proper beefy      smell to it, and not over roasted, you will see what I      mean.    </p>    <p>      I used to have a fairly rough and ready way of killing,      skinning and cutting up a beast, but a butcher friend of      mine has given me the following advice:<br />    </p>    <p>      Shoot or humane-kill the animal in the brain.    </p>    <p>      Stick just in front of the breast bone (sternum). Cut just      deeply enough to sever the main blood vessels and let the      animal bleed-do not stick too deep. With the shot      animal lying on the ground, stand near its throat with your      back to it, push its head up with one leg and its forelegs      down with the other, and cut just in front of the brisket.      Cut in carefully and you will find that you have severed      the main blood vessels.    </p>    <p>      Whatever you do don't cut into the chest cavity. The animal      cannot kick you in its nervous post-mortem kickings because      you are standing too near to it. (Catch the blood either      for black puddings, or to mix with the pigs' mash, or to      activate the compost heap.)    </p>    <p>      Chop off the horns and skin the head.    </p>    <p>      Cut the throat across the larynx; tie off the weasand (wind      pipe) and cut through it and go on cutting to the occipital      joint (the first vertebra) and cut the head right off.    </p>    <p>      Cut through the tarsals and carpals (the knee joints). With      a little practice you can find them and cut through without      having to use a saw or a chopper. Open up the gam cords      ready for the gamble (see MOTHER NO. 29 under "Pig", pages      22-28).    </p>    <p>      Cut the skin right along the belly line without cutting      into ,the abdominal wall. Skin the neck and the brisket and      pull most of the hide off the belly but don't yet skin the      fore shanks.    </p>    <p>      Insert the point of the knife gently through the abdominal      wall just behind the brisket, shove your hand behind the      knife so as to protect the innards from the knife, and cut      right along centre line of belly to the cod fat (around the      penis).    </p>    <p>      Remove the caul fat (the membrane to which the guts are      attached). Empty the bladder <em>(not</em> over the meat!),      split the buttock so that the bung, or arse-hole, can fall      out, and tie the latter off (that means tie it with a piece      of string so nothing can come out of it).    </p>    <p>      Saw through the breast bone (sternum) from the neck      backwards. If you don't do this now, with the beast lying      on the ground, you'll never do it later, for the guts will      hang down and prevent you from doing it, and the guts can't      come out until you have done it.    </p>    <p>      Insert the gamble and hoist the beast half off the      ground.<br />    </p>    <p>      Get the skin off the hind quarters and off the tail.<br />    </p>    <p>      Hoist right up and the innards will fall right out.<br />    </p>    <p>      Remove the liver carefully. Excise the gall bladder from      it.<br />    </p>    <p>      Cut the diaphragm away.<br />    </p>    <p>      Haul out pluck (heart and lungs). Clean out chest cavity of      odd bits and pieces.    </p>    <p>      Finish flaying. Haul the hide right off.<br />    </p>    <p>      Split the carcase in two. (I would do this next day, but my      friend didn't say so.)</p><p>Trim out all blood vessels, etc. Wipe it all down inside    with a clean, warm, moist cloth.</p>    <p>      You should treat the intestines as I recommended for pig's      small intestines and salt down for big sausage casings (see      MOTHER NO. 29).    </p><p>There are four stomachs:</p>    <p>      1. The <em>rumen,</em> or paunch, which is enormous. Open      and clean it in a running brook, take it home, scald it      with boiling water, scrape inside, put in brine for a few      days. When you want it boil it and coot it in clean brine.      Cut it up and cook it as you desire. Tripe, well seasoned      and piping hot, is a dish very much too good for a king.    </p><p>2. The <em>reticulum,</em> or honeycomb stomach. Do as    above, and it is fine for Tripe Normandy, but this is not a    cookery book.</p>    <p>      3. The <em>omasum,</em> or 'Bible-bag'. Good only for the      pigs.    </p><p>4. The <em>abomasum,</em> or reed. Where, in a young    calf, the rennet comes from. Open and wash and it is good for    tripe. Or the dogs?</p>    <p>      The hooves should be scalded, when you can pull the hard      hooves off leaving 'cow heels'. These make 'calves-foot      jelly', or are marvellous in brawn.    </p><p>The <em>suet,</em> which is the dry crumbly fat inside    the belly, should be kept for puddings, mincemeat, etc. All    ordinary fat surplus to requirements as part of a joint can    be rendered down for dripping.</p>    <p>      Now we have the weighty job of jointing our beef. Here I      would strongly advise you to get a butcher to help you, at      least the first time that you cut up a steer. Get him to do      it slowly, and <em>label,</em> whatever you do, the joints      that he cuts out of it. I am not going to describe the      indescribable: that is how to joint a side of beef. It      cannot be conveyed in words. It cannot be conveyed in      pictures either, for you are trying to depict a      three-dimensional matter of great complexity on a      two-dimensional piece of paper. See the drawing, however,      and here-very important-is a list of what the      various cuts should be used for:    </p>		        <p>      Any of the stewing bits will make soup. While on the      subject of soup, the deep freeze comes to the aid of the      would-be disciples of Mrs. Beeton today. There is nothing      in the world so nourishing as good 'beef stock'. In the      small household of today we cannot have a stock pot      constantly simmering over the fire. But we can boil up      gallons of good stock all at once and freeze it. Simply      boil it up for a long time, bones and all (bones      especially), and all odd bits, cow heels too. Pour it off      the bones and let cool. Take off fat. Reduce it some more      if you like and freeze it into cubes in your ice-cube      moulds, or pour into cartons, leaving 1/2" space at the top      of the carton otherwise the stuff will expand over it. If      you have a few dozen of these frozen blocks of beef stock      in your freezer you can make the most magnificent soup      whenever you want to, by simply throwing a block into the      pot together with whatever vegetables or whatever you are      making soup out of. Pour into a polythene bag and put that      in a square carton to shape it first. Stock is one thing      that does not deteriorate in the slightest in the deep      freeze, provided you get all the fat off it first. It does      not want 'thawing'-just throw the ice straight into      the pot. Try one day cooking some soup like this and at the      same time heating up some tinned or packeted soup, to      compare them.    </p>    <p>      But back to our joints. There is method in it all: it is      not just superstition. Steaks must be cut across the grain      of tender muscle. Muscle that does a lot of work, like the      silverside, is tough. Silverside is on the outside of the      leg and takes a lot of stresses while the beast is walking      about: therefore it is tough and gristly and not too good      for roasting, but it is prime beef just the same. It just      happens to be very good for pickling. To pickle it prick it      over with a needle, rub it with saltpetre and brown sugar      and let it stand for 24 hours. Then put it in the brine tub      for 8 to 10 days.    </p>    <p>      <em>The brine</em> tub. Brine should be clean water and      salt boiled and allowed to cool. The concentration of salt      should be such that a potato should float in it. If the      potato sinks you haven't got enough salt. Any meat will      keep indefinitely in brine: it was brined beef that took      Drake around the world. The brine tub should have a loose      round board under the meat, traditionally with holes bored      through it, and another such board on top of the meat with      a stone on it to keep the meat down. Do <em>not</em> use a      metal weight for this purpose ever. Dorothy Hartley in her      great book (it will become a world classic in time and Will      be read long after Mrs. B. has been forgotten) <em>Food In      England</em> (Macdonald), is good on how to treat and cook      salted meats.    </p>    <p>      If you must try to cut up your steer yourself, this is the      order in which you should tackle it:    </p>    <p>      <em>Forequarter:</em> Cut off the brisket, then the ribs,      then the 'leg of mutton'.<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Hindquarter:</em> Cut off thin flank; then sirloin,      aitchbone, shank, thick flank; then separate the topside      out; then the silverside. You have left the thick rump of      flank. Cut the best of this for steaks and boil the rest.    </p>    <p>      Of course all beef is eatable (even the bit the harness      rubbed against!) and if you hack at it in complete      ignorance you will still get a great number of good meals.      But you will be roasting what you ought to grill, and      grilling what you ought to boil and all the rest of it.      Your ox is a very valuable animal. You could sell him      nowadays for nearly three hundred dollars. Surely it is      worth the expense of having a butcher attend to him, or      sending him to the municipal slaughterhouse and then      bribing one of the butchers there to cut him up properly      for you? If you do this, go to any trouble that it takes to      label each joint, and when you put the joints in the deep      freeze label them in such a manner that the labels do not      come off and you can really read them. Otherwise you might      as well be hacking into a frozen mammoth. Everything that      goes into the deep freeze has to go in a closed polythene      bag.<br />    </p>    <p>      The stewing meat, and I should classify a lot of it as this      if I were you, is far better cut up in small pieces      <em>before you</em> put it in the deep freeze in polythene      bags of a size suitable for making one good stew for you.    </p>    <p>      <em>Potting is</em> another way of preserving beef:<br />    </p>    <p>      1. Lay it in salt for three days.<br />      2. Wash the salt off.<br />      3. Season with a pinch of saltpetre, herbs and      spices.<br />      4. Put some suet and butter on top of it.<br />      5. Leave it in a slow oven all night.<br />      6. Pour off the fat.<br />      7. Cut the beef up small and put, hot, into a pot.<br />      8. Press down tight and pour on top of it clear strained      fat-very hot.<br />      9. Cover with greaseproof paper when cold.    </p>    <p>      It will keep for a couple of months.<br />    </p>    <p>      Fresh beef should be well hung before eating. Ten days in      cold weather is not too much. The older the animal the      longer the hanging-a fortnight for a four-year-old,      if you ever have one.    </p>    <p>      Veal should be eaten within three or four days of slaughter      though. But veal should be left to the French. We cannot      afford to waste potential beef animals in that wanton      manner, except a few to get rennet out of.<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>The tongue:</em> soak in boiled, spiced, cold brine      (with the silverside if you like). Leave it there for six      days. Bake it in the oven. Skin it. Pot it and cover with      clarified butter and/or suet as for potted beef.    </p>    <p>      Our ox keeps us lavishly in beef for a year.<br />    </p>       <h3>MUTTON</h3>      <p>We kill two or three sheep a year, and now that we have got      the deep freeze it is a very easy business indeed. I shoot      the sheep with the .22 (in Africa we used to stun him with      the back of an axe), lay him on his left side and stick him      just below and behind the ear. One should then break his      neck by grasping his lower jaw with one's left hand,      placing right hand over his poll and jerking upwards. I      omit this part of the little ceremony because, with the .22      bullet, he is already as dead as mutton.    </p>    <p>      I then skin his legs and throat out, open his throat, tie      off his weasand and then haul him up on the gamble.<br />    </p>    <p>      Finishing skinning him (and as much as possible of this      should be done with the fist-not with the knife: the hide      should not be cut, nor should the meat, and large areas of      fat and flesh should not be left sticking to the hide), I      rip his belly from the brisket upwards, remove the caul,      cut the bung loose and tie it off, remove the bladder and      <em>hulk</em> the sheep-that is haul out his stomachs      and guts. As you do so you must pull his food pipe through      his diaphragm. Then split the breast bone, remove the pluck      (liver, lights and heart), wipe him out inside with a      clean, warm, wet cloth and put in a stick called a 'back      set', which is to spread him open and let the air in. The      large intestine can be used for sausage casings.    </p>    <p>      Hang him a week, but of course you can begin to eat bits      and pieces before that-the liver of course the first      day. In Africa I used to kill a sheep in the dry season,      when the days were as hot as hell but the nights were      freezing. I would hang the meat outside at night out of      leopard reach, bring it in early in the morning and wrap it      up in many sheets of newspaper. Like this I could keep it      for a month.<br />    </p>    <p>      While on the subject of Africa, I must here mention      <em>biltong. Biltong</em> is salted and dried strips of      buck meat or beef and it is almost worshipped by South      Africans. Living in the back-veld of South West Africa, as      I used to do, <em>biltong</em> formed an important part of      my diet. If I shot a gemsbok or a kudu I would turn a very      large part of it into <em>biltong.</em> I have made it in      Wales since then, in fact I made some last year, out of      beef, and it has been perfectly successful. The only      drawback is you need prime cuts really; <em>biltong</em>      made from odd bits of scrag end is not really much good.    </p>    <p>      But this is the way you do it. Cut lean meat up into      strips, say an inch square but the longer the better, along      the grain, or fibre, of the meat. This is most important:      do not cut it across the grain. Lay it in dry salt for six      hours. Wash the salt off it and hang it-if in      southern Africa in the dry season-in the shade but in      the breeze-if in the British Isles in the chimney. I leave      mine in the, chinmey, in light smoke, for say three days,      take it down, hang it up in the kitchen, and it is perfect      <em>biltong.</em> It is as hard as hickory. To eat it you      just pare or shred little shavings off the end of it across      the grain with your Joseph Roger 'Lambsfoot' knife (old      back-velders will know what I mean), put it on bread and      butter, and it is delicious.    </p>    <p>      <em>Rennet.</em> If you kill calves you can make your own      rennet, or you can make it if you cadge a few calf stomachs      off a butcher. The calves must have been young suckling      calves. The fourth stomach is the one you want and it is      known, to rennet-makers, as the <em>vell.</em> Take your      veil, or more if you have them, clean them with a cloth but      don't wash them. Sprinkle dry salt on them and leave for a      day or two or until they are needed. Then cut them into      strips, put in water which should have had salt added and      been boiled and then cooled. If you have four veils you      will want a gallon of this brine: if one veil a quarter of      a gallon. Soak the strips in the brine for five days,      squeezing the strips in the hands three times a day to get      the rennet out. Strain the brine off carefully and that is      your rennet. You will need eight times as much as this for      a cheese recipe as you would need of bought rennet. Sally      and I have never made it and I got this out of a book.    </p>         <h3>POULTRY</h3>        <p>      To kill a chicken grab its legs in your left hand, put your      right hand over the back of its head, bend the head upwards      at the same time stretching its neck. It is a turning      movement of the hand. You will feel the spine snap. If you      do it too hard you will pull the head off which doesn't      matter but it looks disgusting.    </p>    <p>      Start plucking immediately if you are going to dry pluck.      Every second counts, for the feathers come out easily when      the bird is warm but very uneasily when it is getting cold.      Sit down, put the wings (which will go on flapping      violently for a time) between your knees, and quickly pluck      the feathers off the breast. You will soon learn how to      pluck without tearing the skin-it's matter of      experience, and Old Mother Common Sense. Then pluck the      whole bird. Sally and I sit, in the winter, and do it in      front of the fire and throw the feathers straight on the      fire, but the true self-supporter will not do this. The      feathers should be preserved for stuffing pillows. If you      do this with them pile them in a very slow oven, or on a      grid over the stove, for some hours to dry first. At the      very least throw them on the compost heap, where they will      help to activate the compost. We are just lazy, and      comfort-loving.<br />    </p>    <p>      Singe the bird and hang it up by its legs in the meat safe      (away from the flies).    </p>    <p>      Next day take the plucked bird, cut round its knees and      haul its legs off, lay it on its tummy on the bench, stick      a knife right through the flesh on the back of its neck      above the spine and move the knife towards the head, taking      it right out before getting to the head. This leaves a flap      of skin and flesh with which to cover the neck-hole when      you stuff the bird.    </p>    <p>      Take a pair of secateurs and snip the spine as near to the      body as you can get. As you have already broken the spine      near the head the neck will now come out. Put it in the      giblet bowl.    </p>    <p>      Cut off the head and put it in the pig bucket.    </p>    <p>      Insert your finger in the neck-hole and describe a circle      with your finger breaking away all the ligaments or      whatever they are by which the innards of the bird are      anchored to the neck flesh. In other words insert your      finger, bend it, and revolve the bird through 360 degrees.      You will feel the ligaments breaking.    </p>    <p>      Carefully cut right round the arse-hole so as not to pierce      the rectum, and start extracting the guts. Remove the soft      fat that clings to the intestines and drop the latter in      the pig bucket. I always make a cut each side of the hole I      have got after this to enlarge it so that I can get my      whole hand in. Put your hand in, keeping the back of it      hard up against the inside of the back of the bird, and      haul out all the machinery. Cut off the gall bladder and      keep the liver in the giblets. Take the gizzard and cut      half round it with a knife-but only severing the first      layer. Pull that layer off-leaving a yellow bag full      of grit. Throw the grit bag away and keep the outside as a      giblet. Giblet soup. Legs too.    </p>    <p>      Make sure you get the lungs out (they are tiny) and the      crop. The latter is right up in the neck end. These go in      the pig bucket.    </p>    <p>      Wipe, the inside with a clean, warm, moist cloth. Truss      your bird in any fancy way you have. If it is young, stuff      it and roast it. If it is old, boil it    </p>    <p>      Ducks serve the same. Ducks are prime to eat at exactly 10      weeks, no more, no less.    </p>    <p>      Geese and turkeys are too large and tough to break their      necks as I have described for chickens. Hold your bird by      its legs also holding its wing-tips in your hands so it      can't flap. Lower its head towards the ground. It will      automatically lift its head, making an angle of its neck.      Get your wife to lay a broom-stick over its neck. Stand on      the broom-stick with one foot each side of the bird's neck      and pull the legs upwards. Suddenly you will feel the spine      in the neck snap. Don't pull the head off.    </p>    <p>      Singeing is done to remove the fluff and quills. You can do      it with a burning bit of paper, a gas jet, or a meths      sponge.    </p>    <p>      Wet-plucking is a grisly business, but if you want to do it      (it is quicker) scald the bird for 30 seconds at 125° F      (52° C) or for 5 seconds at 180° F (82° C).    </p>
