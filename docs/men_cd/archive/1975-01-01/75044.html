        <h5 id="byline"> </h5><p>To involve those having General Class licenses, and still make slow-scan TV part of the week-end activities, we're going to try something new. The primary operating frequencies will be in the Advanced portions of the bands, just 4 kilohertz up-frequency from the usual SSTV gathering frequencies. Each moderator, however, will try to beg or borrow a second receiver which will be tuned to a specific General Class frequency in the band being used. In this way, the "Generals" can listen to what's happening on the primary frequency and still be able to reach the moderator with their questions and comments.</p><h3>THE "FUTURES HAMFEST"</h3><p>Among amateur radio's traditions are periodic get-togethers where hams from miles around meet to spend a sociable weekend, listen to talks on technical topics, look at the latest equipment and swap old parts and radio gear. These gatherings are usually called "hamfests".</p><p>On one of the West Coast New Directions Roundtable sessions, Ron Wilbur (K6ZEZ) made a suggestion which caught the imagination of the group: Why not hold a new kind of hamfest some weekend . . . an <em>on-the-air</em> event devoted to exploring the future? By planning well in advance and concentrating a lot of effort on that one occasion, we could line up various knowledgeable people to talk with us about our planet's problems. In addition, we could got a bunch of "doing" folks to rap with us about the approaches they personally are taking to meet those challenges.</p><p>Well, mark the weekend of March 8-9 on your calendar and start making preparations, 'cause that's when it's going to happen I The final schedule will depend on such factors as the number and location of stations willing to act as "moderators" or "facilitators" and the completed list of people who agree to share their insights with us. We can promise, though, that the sessions will cover a wide range of present and future concerns, including the environment, economics, the back-to-the-land movement, energy, women's issues, education and more.</p><p>The schedule I'm including with this column is as complete as it can be at present, with the Futures Hamfest project still in its early stages. Last-minute details can be obtained by sending a stamped selfaddressed envelope to Ron Wilbur (625 24th St, Hermosa Beach, Calif. 90254) or to me.</p><p>There are a number of ways to get involved in the Futures Hamfest. The most fundamental-if you have a ham license-is to join us on the air March 8 and 9. Another is to spread the word to your amateur acquaintances and get the general public interested (a good way to introduce people to ham radio at one of its better moments). You might, for instance, declare "open house" at your station throughout that weekend by giving advance word to your local newspaper. If you know other hams, see if they won't do the same. Any with SSTV gear would be especially welcome, since many presentations will be accompanied by slides, drawings and photos converted to slowscan for transmission.</p><p>Perhaps you're not a radio freak yourself but have something to contribute to a discussion of the future . . . or perhaps you know someone who does. In that case, you can still get into the act in any of three ways . . . the first of which is direct participation at some ham's station. (if you have any connection with a university, or live near one, perhaps you can stimulate the people involved with the campus station to join in that weekend.</p><p>) A second way for non-hams to contribute to the proceedings is by making a tape in advance. Such recordings can be in cassette or reel-toreel format. The length is flexible, but try to keep your comments on a given subject down to 10 minutes or less. (More complete presentations by people deeply into a given field will naturally be longer.) The interview approach seems to fit better with ham radio than the formal lecture. If you have an interesting tape, or are planning to make one, contact Ron Wilbur. He'll tell you where to send your contribution, and who will be converting the visuals-if any-to SSTV<br />M<br />. A third option-participation by phone patch-offers a whole range of possibilities, since Ron expects to have access to a WATS line during the Hamfest. Some folks will-be able to give their entire presentations by phone, and others who have pretaped their remarks can be called during the question-andanswer sessions. It may even be possible to tie regional nets together. Again, contact Ron Wilbur for more information.</p><h3>NEW DIRECTIONS NEWS</h3><p>First, the bad news: Randy Brink (WA7BKR), moderator of the West Coast roundtable, original "chairman" of the Futures Hamfest and one of New Directions' most active supporters, broke his back in a 50-foot fall from a tree . . . the very day he'd planned to leave for Spokane to do some Futures Hamfest taping during the last week of environmental sessions at Expo '74. Recovery will doubtless be slow, so I'm sure he'll be in the mood for any words of cheer you can muster. The good news is that Mitt Nodacker, who is coordinating the RTTY Technical Group, has sent out a newsletter to those who expressed interest in starting a "print" network by radio. If you'd like to see a copy, send your SASE to Mitt at Box 8557, Pocatello, Idaho 83209.</p><h3>INFORMATION SHARING</h3><p>As I mentioned in MOTHER NO. 30, New Directions will be keeping a register of amateurs who are willing to share their communication facilities and serve as radio-accessed information resources. The first installment of that list is included in this issue.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Cop Macdonald (WOORX)</p><p>P.O. Box 483</p><p>Rochester, Minnesota 55901</p><h3>AMATEUR RADIO REGISTER</h3><p>When circumstances permit, the following radio amateurs would like to offer the use of their stations free of charge to others. Certain of them also hope access to information in specific areas of interest, or to people with experience in particular fields. If asked, these hams will attempt to provide assistance in the categories listed.
