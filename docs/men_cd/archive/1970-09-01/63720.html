                    <p>      Reprinted Courtesy of POPULAR SCIENCE Monthly. Â©1961      by<br />    </p>    <p>      Popular Science Publishing Co., Inc.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BILL CHENEY</strong><br />      POPULAR SCIENCE<br />      355 Lexington Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017    </p>            <p>      SO YOU GOT THE DOME UP THIS SUMMER AND IT SHOT YOUR ENTIRE      BUDGET. YOU'VE ALREADY MOVED IN, BUT WINTER'S COMIN' ON AND      YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW YOU'RE GONNA KEEP WARM. WOULDN'T IT BE      NICE IF YOU COULD FIND SOME WAY TO HEAT THE THING FREE . .      . AND WOULDN'T IT BE EVEN NICER TO GET PAID FOR KEEPING      WARM?    </p>    <p>      YES, INDEED. AND YOU CAN DO IT TOO. BILL CHENEY DOES.      ALTHOUGH BILL HEATS A SHOP AND NOT A HOME WITH THE RIG      DESCRIBED IN THIS ARTICLE, THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT CAN'T      SEE YOU THROUGH THAT FIRST HOMESTEADING WINTER . . . OR      MORE.    </p>    <p>      NATURALLY, MOTHER ADVISES THAT YOU FOLLOW CONSTRUCTION      DRAWINGS EXACTLY AND OBSERVE PROPER PRECAUTIONS WHEN USING      YOUR HEATER.    </p>        <p>      The fuel I burn to heat my shop doesn't cost me a penny. In      fact, I'm <em>paid</em> a buck for every 100 gallons I haul      away. It's old crankcase oil, and gas stations are happy to      have me pump it out of their waste tanks.    </p>    <p>      I built my own stove from a condemned bottled-gas cylinder.      You can pick one up for peanuts because legally they can't      be used again, and it's too costly to cut them up for      scrap. If you can't get one, a 30, 50, or 100 gallon steel      drum can be substituted. My stove cylinder is 14" by 40",      but these dimensions aren't critical. The ones for the      throat and firing port <em>are,</em> since they guarantee      the hot throat that's required to burn any fuel. I      circulate the heat with a small electric fan, and there's      plenty to spread around: With clean oil, the heater can      produce up to 500,000 BTUs per hour.    </p>    <p>      It's clean heat, too, although some smoke is generated when      the burner is first started. To carry this (and all carbon      monoxide fumes) outside, a stack is required. Where      erecting one is impractical, you can burn natural or      bottled gas, instead. You just insert a different jet      nozzle. When burning gas fuels, I exhaust right into the      shop; there's some water vapor, but not enough to cause      troublesome condensation. Better check local regulations,      though. If they specify a stack for gas, too, you might as      well enjoy the economy of crankcase oil.    </p>    <p>      Start with the stove. If you've been able to pick up an old      bottled-gas cyl inder, you must prepare it in a special      way. Set the tank upright on its base and fill it with      water. Lay out an 8" circle at the crown of the domed top.      Using a cutting torch, pierce the tank with a short arc cut      out on this circle. (As the cut will be below water line,      water will flow out until level with it.) Complete the      circle and drain the tank.    </p>    <p>      With the tank up-ended, cut a 6" diameter hole in the      center of the base for the exhaust. It's in the center so      heated air will build up in the top of the stove, improving      combustion as well as retaining heat. I formed my exhaust      pipe by bending a sheet of 1/8" steel plate, but lighter      material can be used.    </p>                   <p>      Weld the throat at the other end, and complete the stove      by placing it on its side in a sturdy stand. Mine is a pipe      frame welded to the cylinder and equipped with casters so      the stove can be rolled around the shop or used outside.    </p>    <p>      You need lots of air to burn the fuel properly. I bought a      used vacuum cleaner blower and brazed a 1" pipe coupling      into its outlet for attaching the burner pipe. Since      throttling the air output causes the blower to speed up, an      airflow valve could damage the motor. Instead, I installed      a rheostat, salvaged from a sewing machine, to regulate the      motor speed.    </p>    <p>      The heart of the heater is the burner itself. It's made of      four black-iron 1" pipe fittings. The deflector imparts a      swirling motion to the blower air that helps mix it with      the fuel from the jet. The jet is secured with a setscrew      so it can be adjusted-or replaced with another type      if the fuel is changed. The position of the jet, in or out,      depends on the choice of fuel, and-if it is      gas-the fuel pressure.    </p>    <p>      When oil is used, the bottom of the supply tank should be      about a foot above the burner.    </p>    <p>      To start the burner, if oil is the fuel, open the port      plate and thrust a crumpled newspaper or oil-soaked rag      well into the throat. Light this, close the port turn on a      little air, and slowly open the fuel valve until oil      ignites in the throat. Gradually increase the air supply;      then give more oil. Once the throat becomes hot, increase      the flow of both air and oil, experimenting for the best      mixture and proper jet position When properly set, there      should be no smoke or soot. To shut the stove off turn off      the oil first, letting the blower run until the fire is      completely out. If this isn't done, oil may drip onto the      hot throat and flame will puff out of the burner port.    </p>    <p>      When firing with gas, start the blower at low speed and      hold a piece of burning paper just below the closed port      while slowly turning on the gas.    </p>    <p>      Whatever your fuel, never look directly into the port;      always inspect it at an angle, or use a small mirror. While      the fuel can't explode, the great heat might singe your      whiskers.    </p>
