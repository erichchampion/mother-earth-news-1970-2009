Reprinted by permission.</p>    <p>      Here's yet another selection from Jeanie Darlington's new      book on organic gardening. If you enjoy the following as      much as most folks enjoyed the six pages we ran in Issue 3      and the four pages that No. 4. carried, you'll want to      order a personal copy of GROW YOUR OWN direct from Jeanie      at Box 222, Miranda, California 95553. Only $1.75 and worth      it.    </p>    <p>      It feels really good to run your hands through good rich      soil, to smell it, and to watch things grow in it. The      months of October and November are the best time to start      preparing your soil for next year's vegetable garden. This      applies both to established garden plots and to new areas.      Make sure the plot has all-day sun exposure, because most      vegetables really need sun.    </p>    <p>      California soil has a high clay content and needs a lot of      organic matter (leaves, manure, compost) added to it to      break it down and lighten it up. This helps in the release      of soil nutrients and allows good root growth.    </p>    <p>      If you're working on an area of hard sun-baked clay, it      might be best to wait until the rains have softened it up a      bit. But don't ever work with soggy, muddy soil, because if      you do, you will end up with big clods of clay that are      very hard to break up into small pieces. If the soil      crumbles in your hand rather than forming a mud ball, it is      in ideal condition to be worked.    </p>    <p>      A spading fork is a little easier to handle than a spade,      because it's lighter and breaks up lumps with less work.      But a spade will do. Loosen the soil to a depth of 6 inches      by lifting forkfuls of soil, overturning them and letting      them shatter into small pieces. If there was a mulch or      grass growing on the plot, just turn that under. And if you      have some compost, work that in now.    </p>    <p>      Now sprinkle on a nitrogenous organic fertilizer such as      blood meal at 5 lb. per 100 sq. ft. Or get a load of fresh      manure from a stable and spread it at a rate of 150 lb. per      250 sq. ft. Too much really can't hurt. Then sprinkle on 5      lbs. of bone meal or 10 lbs. of phosphate rock per 100 sq.      ft. to supply phosphorus. And then 10 lbs. of granite dust      or greensand per 100 ft., or something else to supply      potash. If you have wood ashes, save them for applying next      spring.    </p>    <p>      There's no need to fork these fertilizers down into the      soil. The winter rains will do that for you. But be sure to      cover the area with a nice thick blanket of leaves or hay.      If your garden has winter crops growing, you can do all of      this to the spaces between the rows.    </p>    <p>      To further improve the soil, you may add all your      decomposable kitchen waste to the plot, if you don't have a      compost pile. Dig a hole, put the garbage in, mix some soil      in with it, and cover it with dirt. It won't smell.      However, a nurse from Tacoma suggests that covering the      area with a board will keep dogs from digging up fresh      garbage if this should happen. You could also apply this      idea more systematically by using trenches in case you're      the type who forgets where you last dug a hole.    </p>    <p>      By spring your soil will be mellow and workable. Knowing      California soil, you'll probably want to add more compost      or manure and more blood meal then. But you won't have much      else to do except plant.    </p>    <p>      If you like to work in conjunction with the moon, it is      best to turn sod and work soil when the moon is in the      barren signs, such as Leo, Virgo, Gemini and Aquarius.
