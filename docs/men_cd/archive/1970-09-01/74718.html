                        <p>      <strong>DA NA WAQ (WHITE BEAVER)</strong><br />      <strong>AKWESASNE NOTES/ROOSEVELTOWN, NEW YORK      13683</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>March 20, 1871 - a great day in Morley, Alberta. It was      on that day that little Tatanga Mani (Walking Buffalo) was,      born. In the years that followed, he was adopted by white      missionary John McDougall, educated in white men's schools,      returned to the reserve at Morley to advise and guide his      people, and finally in his old age, was asked to act as an      emissary of peace on behalf of the Canadian      Government.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Join our Stoney brothers and hear his words.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Nobody tries to make the coyotes act like beavers, or      the eagles behave like robins. Christians see themselves as      set apart from the rest of the animal and plant world by      superiority, even as a special creation. Perhaps the      principles of brotherhood which the world urgently needs      come more easily to the Indian. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Do you know that trees talk? Well, they do. They talk      to each other, and they'll talk to you, if you will listen.      Trouble is, white people don't listen. They never listened      to the Indians, and so I don't suppose they'll listen to      the other voices in nature. But I have learned a lot from      trees, sometimes about the weather, sometimes about      animals, sometimes about the Great Spirit.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"We were lawless people but we were on pretty good      terms with the Great Spirit, creator and ruler of all. You      whites assumed we were savages. You didn't understand our      prayers. You didn't try to understand. When we sang or:      praises to the sun or moon or wind, you said we were      worshipping idols. Without understanding, you condemned us      as lost souls just because our form of worship was      different from yours.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"We saw the Great Spirit's work in almost everything:      sun, moon, trees, wind, and mountains. Sometimes we      approached him through these things. Was that so bad? I      think we have a true belief in the supreme being, a      stronger faith than that of most of the whites who have      called us pagans. The red savages have always lived closer      to nature than have the white savages. Nature is the book      of that great power which one man calls God and which we      call the Great Spirit. But, what difference does a name      make?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"We had none of your denominations to split us, it      introduce hatreds in the name of religion. We had no      man-made guides to 'right living'; nature was our guide.      Nature is still Bible, and I've just retruend after many      days of studying it.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"I'll tell you what I think. We were on better terms      with the Great Spirit before the white man came than we      were after he confused us by attempting to frighten its      into joining his churches. As devil worshippers, they said      we were heading right down the road to hell. Frighten us?      Who wouldn't be frightened if they were told they'd burn in      a lake of fire forever if they didn't accept certain      teachings. The white man meant well. Many of the      missionaries were my friends, but they underestimated the      Indian faith when they used fear to make us change. There      is no such thing as hell to our native religion, and we can      never imagine the Great Spirit choosing to inflict      everlasting torture on man as a punishment.<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"As I understand nature's ruler, he would not restrict      the truth to a few favoured humans, allowing the others to      remain in eternal darkness. If the Great Spirit is prepared      to reveal secrets of importance to people, he will give all      humans in all lands an equal chance of getting that      enlightenment.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"My people have been searching for the truth for      generations, and they continue to find it. All races of      people have conducted such searches. Perhaps that explains      why nearly all the world's religions have points in common,      like charity forgiveness, and belief in life after      death.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Crowfoot of the Blackfeet tribe was a thinker, as      everyone agrees, but he never gave up his native religion.      They coaxed him, but he held on to his own beliefs. The old      chief didn't ridicule your religion and its teachers, but      his own faith brought him enough satisfaction and comfort.      The same could be said about Piapot. For years he was under      pressure to change. He didn't try to convert white men to      his religion, but he hated bigotry and he had no time for      people who contended that the white man's religion was      inspired by the Creator but the Indian's was not. Who do      they suppose inspired the Indian's religion?"</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>At 87 years of age in London, England, he said: "It's      not right raising kids so far from nature. I suppose your      boys and girls have never seen pussy willows, robins      building nests, or grass covered hills. This pavement is      fine for cars, but it is hard medicine for children.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Hills are always more beautiful than stone buildings,      you know. Living in a city is an artificial existence. Lots      of people hardly ever feel real soil under their feet, see      plants grow except in flower pots, or get far enough beyond      the street lights to catch the enchantment of a night sky      studded with stars. When people live far from scenes of the      Great Spirit's making, it's easy for them to forget his      laws. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In Germany: "I remember the war years. We were led to      hate the Germans. Now I think they are good people. I'd      pitch my tent here anytime. I'll never hate anybodv again.      Hating hurts me more than it hurts the other fellow. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To all Indians, he said: "You see, we lost our land and      our freedom, but we don't have to lose all our Indian ways      and habits. As good Indians, we can make a substantial      contribution to Canadian culture. It may not have occurred      to many white men that red, black, and yellow peoples might      have some good ideas about satisfying the world's needs.      1'll never try to justify the foolish fighting and scalping      my people did, but in some ways, we had better ways of      living. At least we kept our fighting to small wars,      whereas the so-called civilized whites go in for big      conflicts. "There's a lot of madness in the white man's      world. We think whites would be better off to slow down and      live closer to the soil and forests and growing things,      instead of galloping around like stampeding buffaloes in      cutback country. If they would take some of our advice,      they might find a contentment which they had not discovered      in their mad rush for money and for the pleasures which      they think it will buy. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To all White Men, he said: "It's strange, but in trying      to find solutions to Indian problems, the authorities speak      to nearly everybody but Indians. Many of us could offer      sound advice on this question. But remember, we're proud of      our race, and we want to continue to be Indians. I was born      with a bronze skin and I like it. Some of my friends were      born white or black or yellow. They were not consulted. But      that's all right. There are yellow roses, white roses, and      red roses and the fragrance of one is about as nice as      another. I hope my children will live in a world where      people of all colors can sit and work together without      having to conform completely to the majority's will . . .      You must accept us as Indians who want to be Indians and      who are proud to be Indians. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Death claimed our wise brother December 26, 1967, and      the entire world mourned. Any fool can be quarrelsome and      belligerant. Being half good and half bad takes neither      effort nor skill. But being a man of peace requires      bravery.</em>    </p>
