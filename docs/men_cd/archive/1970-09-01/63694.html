                <p>      <strong>HOMESTEADING IN CANADA</strong><br />    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by VIKKI OSINSKI    </h5>        <h3>      ANOTHER GARDEN    </h3>    <p>      Long before Europeans came to spoil and pillage this North      American Continent, Nootka, Salish, Kwakuitl, Haisla,      Tsimshian, Makah, Bella Coola, and Skokomish "Indians" led      a rich, full life among the bountiful nature of the      Northwest Coast. Their elaborate tribal societies      flourished in the abundance of natural game, berries and      fishes. Their "status structure" was based on giving. The      more generous a man, the more costly his gifts, the more      bountiful his feast table . . . the higher his status in      the community. In this land of plenty, of gentle rain and      mild climate, civilization had reached a pinnacle of      generosity.    </p>    <p>      Of course this was not a mythical idyllic paradise. There      were frequent wars among tribes, but these were usually      wars of acquisition, not annihilation. The chieftal powers      were very weak, and when the social structure was      threatened – by the arrival of aggressive, mercenary      colonists – it rapidly collapsed. Little is left of      those original inhabitants, or their culture, and most of      what remains is generally misinterpreted and totally      misunderstood. (For a totally empathetic and realistic view      of this fantastic culture and others of the North and      Central Americas I suggest reading MAN'S RISE TO      CIVILIZATION, Peter Farb; Avon Books 1968, the source of      the preceeding material.)    </p>    <p>      Much of the natural abundance of the great West Coast has      changed too, of course, with the growing of great      industrial ports and the gross exploitation (such as lumber      and fishing) of the natural resources. Technology and      pollution have decreed that salmon will no longer cram the      rivers so thickly that "you could step across their backs      to the other side (of the river) without getting your feet      wet." But all is certainly not lost. We have abused the      land but vast areas along the beautiful coast have never      yet felt the foot of man or the scars of super-highways.    </p>    <h3>      THE NORTHERN JUNGLE    </h3>    <p>      If you were asked to identify a photo taken of the forests      along the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, you would      probably first associate the lush, green, fern-infested      jungle with a tropical rain forest.    </p>    <p>      It seems unbelievable that the combination of high moisture      and mild temperatures could produce a treble-layered forest      at latitude of 60°-40° north. Only a bright green      light filters through the first layers of giant conifers      and the middle layers of broad-leafed trees to the bushes      and ferns that blanket the floor. Although the forest teems      with life – deer, squirrels, birds, bears, etc.      – catching the animals is practically impossible due      to the extreme density of the vegetation. Visibility is      limited to a few feet. The rain forest also contains a      "false floor" composed of dead and rotting trees. This      floor is often 10 feet above the real ground and it's      possible to fall through the layer of downed trees and      become trapped below.    </p>    <p>      There are few roads to interrupt the splendor of these      coastal mountain forests: Most of the traffic is handled by      boats running along the coast. Isolated fishing villages      and lumber camps dot the sheltered coves and exotic fjords      along the rugged coast.    </p>    <p>      The coast itself is structured of fantastic wave-sculptured      cliffs and sandy, rocky coves. These cliffs were "recently"      carved by the receding glaciers and their faces are      constantly being reshaped by the erosive and powerful      Pacific surf. In spite of the tremendous pounding surf      along the base of the cliff, the rocks swarm with a      brilliant profusion of starfish, and the hardy abalone      – a large, edible sea-snail.    </p>    <p>      Offshore you can see the rugged islands that were at one      time mountain peaks. The thousand-mile waterway that runs      around these hundreds of rocky fortresses was called "The      Road that Walks" by the Indians. The entire area was      literally carved out by the actions of the last great      glacial period; mountains sunk and rivers submerged and now      it is possible to sail among the peaks of these once mighty      mountains.    </p>    <p>      In the sandy coves you can dig for steamer clams, search      out Dungeness crab from their hiding places around rocks      and pick up Pacific oysters in shallow water during low      tide.    </p>    <p>      This is famous salmon and sturgeon country as well. Even      though the numbers of these huge fish (sturgeons average      200 lbs.) have been greatly diminished by commercial      fisheries, the shortage is hardly noticeable to individual      fishermen. The Indians prepare fresh salmon by cleaning and      splitting the fish and lacing each side (skin down) against      a driftwood plank. The salmon is then smoked slowly over a      low fire. The row, or eggs of the female sturgeon (and      salmon) are used for making caviar.    </p>    <p>      This area has become known for the growing of consistantly      high quality fruits, berries and vegetables. The Fraser      River Valley, east of Vancouver, is especially rich      agriculturally. The rich soil, mild temperatures and      plentiful water insure maximum crop yields. Surprisingly,      the valley is so temperate, wine grapes have been grown      successfully.    </p>    <p>      Temperature extremes are rare. The average summer      temperature near Vancouver is 59.8°, winter 38.2°.      You can expect frost from November to mid-February and snow      cover during this period is negligible.    </p>    <p>      Because of the northern position of the region      (approximately 50° lat.) the sunlight received in the      summer varies from 2-4 hours more than most parts of the      United States. In other words the growing season for most      crops is lengthened (over, say, Ohio) about 180 hours      during the summer months. This often produces "monster"      vegetables and fruits that mature several weeks earlier in      the season, conversely, the winter days are shorter than      lower latitudes, averaging about 8 1/2 hours of daylight.    </p>    <p>      The coast of British Columbia receives over 100 inches of      rainfall a year. The average is even higher on the western      mountain slopes. Most rain falls in the fall and winter.      Though there is usually sufficient moisture through the      summer, some eastern portions of the Fraser River Valley      require irrigation which is easily furnished by the many      clear mountain streams and rivers. The precipitation      generally takes the form of heavy fogs and light drizzle as      opposed to torrential downpours.    </p>    <p>      This region is considered safe from most natural disasters      such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes and      thunderstorms that damage so many parts of the world.      Unlike the San Francisco Bay area, which is plagued by      frequent earthquakes and unstable faulting, only two quakes      have been recorded in the last 100 years in the Pacific      northwest. Both in Puget Sound, Washington.    </p>    <h3>      THE "NATURAL" CITY: VANCOUVER    </h3>        <p>      Vancouver has to be one of the most nature-loving cities in      the world! Within the city limits there are 128 parks.      Included is famous Stanley Park with 1,000 acres, much of      which is pure virgin forest. Conservation groups are very      active and have recently purchased 400 acres 25 miles out      of the city limits for use as a bird sanctuary. Many      controls (on fishing and lumber industries) are being      instituted to preserve the beauty and resources of the      area.    </p>    <p>      Vancouver is a very active art and poetry center, too.      There are several major art galleries in the city and some      really great poetry, etc., is coming out of the Vancouver's      underground. Art and science museums, plus a huge marina      featuring killer whales and many rare Pacific fish, are      also major attractions in this coastal "hub".    </p>    <p>      There is a district of large, old houses called the "West      End" adjacent to Stanley Park in Vancouver. These old      buildings have been converted to inexpensive boarding      houses and apartments. Partially because the city is fairly      new, crowded urban slum areas are virtually unknown. The      beautiful University of British Columbia campus overlooks      the sea in the extreme western part of the city.    </p>    <p>      The economy of Vancouver is based on trade or      transportation (30%) with manufacturing, the lumber      industry, fishing and publishing contributing most of the      other 70%.    </p>    <p>      Vancouver is a perfect place to reap the benefits of      civilization in a natural environment. It may be one of the      least stifling places to settle while exploring the area      for cheap land possibilities. With the variety of parks,      inexpensive natural foods, clean housing and flourishing      artistic awareness, Vancouver could make an important focal      point for a wide variety of life styles.    </p>

The dry air then has very little precipitation to deposit on the mountains' eastern slopes, leaving that region semi-arid.Thus, within only a few miles, the character of the land changes rapidly from a forested, mild coast to sub-artic plains and bush.
