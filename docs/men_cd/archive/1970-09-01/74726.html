                    <div class="sidebar">    <h3>KEN KERN</h3>    <p>      Ken Kern, author of THE OWNER-BUILT HOME and THE      OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, is an amazing fellow and everyone      interested in decentralist, back-to-the-land, rational      living should know of his work. Back in 1948 he began      collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural      construction materials and techniques. He combed the world      for ideas, tried them and started writing about his      experiments.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's      articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN REVOLUTION.      Ken has also issued a three year series of pieces (called      TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun pit design of his      has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.    </p>    <p>      I'm not going to waste time telling you how great Ken's      ideas, experience, artwork and writing are: I'll let you      have the delight of discovering that for yourself. I will      apologize, however, for running the last two chapters and      epilog of OWNER-BUILT HOME and the introduction to      OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD this first time around. We had to do      it that way to fit our magazine into Ken's schedule. It's      worth it!    </p>     <p>- MOTHER</p>    </div>    <h3>      STONE<br /> MASONRY    </h3>    <p>      Next to plain dirt, stone (or rock) is the least exploited      of all materials for building construction. And like      earth-which has been used for centuries in building      walls, floors and roofs-rock is most readily      available at little or no money cost. It can be gathered      (usually free for the hauling) from any streambed, from      abandoned mines and quarries, or from open fields and      embankment cuts. There is hardly a region in the country      that doesn't contain a substantial resource of building      stone.    </p>    <p>      Maps and aerial photographs of one's region are generally      available, and can be employed to advantage in locating      building stone. Agricultural soil maps are revealing and      thorough. Geologic maps indicate existing pit and quarry      sites as well as the type and structure of the rock. U.S.      Coast and Geodetic Survey maps cover nearly every section      of the country. They are especially helpful in locating      abandoned ore mines. Tailings from mines are among the best      sources of building stone. From aerial photos one can      locate such rock-laden features as excavations,      outcroppings, cliffs abandoned railroad and road cuts and      natural streambeds.    </p>    <p>      With such widespread availability, one asks, why is      building stone so rarely exploited by homebuilders? Because      building with stone is similar to building with earth:      There is a large "time" and "labor" factor involved in      gathering and placing the material into a wall. But the      average Owner-Builder's time and labor resource customarily      outweighs his capital resource, so this cannot always be      considered a serious handicap.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps a more pertinent answer to this query lies in the      fact that stone masonry technology-more than any of      the other building trade skills-has been      traditionally clothed in secrecy. Carl Schmidt, in his      little book on <em>Cobblestone Architecture,</em>      illustrates this point:    </p>    <p>      Several very old men, who as little boys saw cobblestone      masons at work, readily recall the jealousies among the      masons. Whenever a visitor appeared while they were      working, they would stop work, hide their tools and do      something else until the visitor went on his way. The fact      that these men succeeded very well in keeping their own      methods a secret, explains the different mannerisms found      in the method of laying up the walls.    </p>    <p>      Through the centuries stone masons also have succeeded in      maintaining a respectable, highly paid and somewhat      apostolic status in the building industry. Their "trade      secrets" are maintained to this day, and include such      important items as an intimate knowledge of rock, the      correct mortar proportions and use of auxilary materials,      the proper selection of tools and organization of work      procedure and-finally-an esthetic awareness of      the rock in place: The total effect and composition of the      finished wall.    </p>    <p>      Intensive research on stone masonry reveals that no      pertinent literature exists on the subject that is      applicable to the unskilled Owner-Builder. Stone masons      maintain their closed shop. In this chapter an attempt is      made to close the enigmatic gap.    </p>    <p>      With fear of over-simplifying the stone masonry skill it      should be stated that the foremost prerequisite of any      mason worth his mortar is an intimate-nearly      intuitive-knowledge of rock. Pick up a rock. Where      the inexperienced observes color, weight and form, the      experienced stone mason notices bedding, seams, rift and      grain. He first visualizes the rock in place, laid on its      natural <em>bedding.</em> Bedding is recognized by a      granular change in color or texture. It is mostly prevalent      in sedimentary rock, where changing conditions of      deposition of sediment under water occur.    </p>    <p>      Bedding joints are horizontal, but <em>seams</em> are      generally vertical, to the rock surface. Seams are regular      in limestone and irregular in granite. They occur in rock      as a result of compression and tension stresses in earth      forms. The direction of greatest ease of splitting in a      rock is called the <em>rift</em> . It may be parallel to      the seam. A second, more minor, direction of splitting is      called the <em>grain.</em> Only the most experienced mason      can detect grain direction.    </p>    <p>      Several simplified systems of rock identification have been      devised to assist the mason in his choice of building      stone. Rock classification can be physical, differentiating      between unstratified and stratified rock, or it can be of a      chemical nature, dividing rock into its siliceous (sandy),      agrillaceous (clayey) or calcareous (limey) composition.      The classical classification of rock, however, is based      upon geological origin-ingeous, sedimentary and      metamorphic. A composite classification system of the more      common building stones, along with their significant      construction properties is presented below.    </p>        <p>      This chapter is one of the few with no bibliography at the      end. The dearth of books may be a continuance of the      "closed shop" stone masonry conspiracy mentioned earlier:      In any event there are <em>no</em> contemporary manuals on      laying up building stone. The Audel reference text on      masonry is typical of what is currently available: The      stone masonry techniques and tools discussed date back to      antiquity. The correct hammer and chisel are identified, as      is the manner of squaring huge marble building blocks.    </p>    <p>      A number of unlikely research sources were used to compile      this chapter; but primarily the actual stone-laying      experience of the author over the past fifteen years forms      the nitty-gritty of what is to follow.    </p>    <p>      The rock classification system illustrated above can prove      of only <em>general</em> value to the Owner-Builder mason.      Let's have a closer look at choosing your rock and building      with this natural resource. <em>Accessibility</em> of the      rock must be one of the prime criterion. An expensive      quarrying or hauling operation can be a deterrent      sufficient to dissuade one from using this material in his      building. In some instances a particularly <em>hard</em>      rock is called for-as in floors and steps. Rock with      cleavage (a splitting quality) is generally a more valuable      characteristic than a block-like monolithic quality.    </p>    <p>      Of course we desire to build a durable wall, and one that      will withstand rain, wind, frost, heat and fire. A building      stone "life" ranges from 10 to 200 years. Frost damage is      common to softer and porous rock. Again, if rock is not      laid on its natural bed-face, frost action will tend to      laminate the layers. Another important rule: The strength      of the mortar should equal the strength of the rock. An      excessively rich mortar is more pervious than a weaker      mortar because shrinkage-cracking occurs in rich mortar.      Mortar joints are the most vulnerable part of the wall to      moisture penetration.    </p>    <p>      Granites are the least affected by weathering: Limestone      and sandstone the most. They are commonly destroyed by      surface erosion (from sea salts, for instance) and      atmospheric pollution. Rain will leach the cementitious      materials found in some sandstone to the surface, where      they become brittle, weak and finally flake off.    </p>        <p>      A number of stone preservatives are available, designed to      protect rock from the aforementioned frost and moisture      penetration hazards. A waterproofing agent prevents the      penetration of moisture but the moisture that <em>does</em>      gain access into the wall is not permitted to escape. This      is bad. The wall should "breathe", whatever material is      used. Moreover, the outer waterproofing layer is a thin      skin which differs in physical properties from the      underlying material. This difference causes certain      stresses to be set up which inevitably force the outside      skin to flake off.    </p>    <p>      One may reason that <em>strength</em> should be the      foremost requisite of rock for building purposes. Rock that      is sound and suitable in other respects, however, is almost      invariably strong enough for use in a wall. Recent tests at      the U.S. Bureau of Standards on samples of Montana      quartzite indicated a compressive strength of 63,000 pounds      per square inch (a rather typical rock strength). A      structure of such material would have to be over <em>10      miles high</em> before failure would occur from crushing      the lower courses!    </p>    <p>      Another good example of structural strength is illustrated      in the 555-foot high Washington Monument. Pressure at the      base course is 700 pounds per square inch; but marble will      sustain a crushing load of 25,000 pounds.    </p>    <p>      The <em>appearance</em> of your dwelling should not be      underestimated when choosing a building stone. Every rock      has its unique color and rock of different color can be      mixed in a wall. Every rock also has its unique lustre, be      it vitreous, pearly, resinous, dull, metallic or whatever.      Rock containing much iron should be avoided, since stains      caused by oxidation of iron under atmospheric influence      will discolor the mortar.    </p>    <p>      Some rock can be "worked" better than others. Angular,      square-edged, quarried rock "lays up" better than roundish      cobblestone boulders. The last are sometimes called      "rolling stones", because they are loosened and weathered      from the parent ledge by natural processes.    </p>    <p>      Workability depends as much upon the correct mortar mix as      it does upon the type of rock laid. A proper mortar is      weather resistant and has adequate bond strength and      compressive strength. The proportion of sand, cement,      fire-clay-and especially-water must be      controlled to within a narrow margin. The optimum      proportion is 12 shovels of clean, washed concrete sand, 4      shovels common cement and 2 shovels fireclay.    </p>    <p>      To give you a better appreciation of this optimum      proportioning, make a trial mix in the kitchen, using      oven-dried sand in a measuring cup: 12 oz. sand; 4 oz.      cement; 2 oz, fireclay; 5 oz. water.    </p>    <p>      The actual process of laying stone consists, first, of      spreading a uniform layer of mortar, then forcing stone      into its bed (a bed can also refer to the top or bottom of      a stone). The mortar should be stiff enough to support the      stone without letting it touch the stone underneath.    </p>    <p>      A bedding trowel is used by stone masons for spreading      large mortar beds. Unlike a brick mason's sharp-pointed      trowel, the bedding trowel has a rounded end. Two sizes are      commonly used. The 2 1/2 cubic foot detachable steel drum      concrete-mortar mixer sold by Sears is entirely sufficient      for either small or extensive masonry work.    </p>    <p>      After a course-or layer-of stone is laid, the      wall behind the facing stone must be carried up, to give      support to the face. This is termed <em>backing</em> and      usually consists of a cheaper class of masonry, or poured      concrete, bonded directly to the face. <em>Bondstones</em>      act as ties, bridging face to backing. Metal      strips-masonry ties-are also commonly used to      tie the face to the backing.    </p>    <p>      The simplest, fastest, and in all respects neatest type of      stone masonry pattern for the Owner-Builder to work is      called "cyclopean" masonry. Various sizes and shapes of      stone are used in cyclopean masonry, with no respect to      regular courses. Joints-spaces between      stones-look best cut deep. A 1/2-wide      <em>tucking</em> trowel is used for this purpose. Master      stone masons can be rightfully proud of their time-consumed      "varicose vein" joints, but the effort required is not      compensated for in the final result.    </p>    <p>      There are several design features of cyclopean masonry that      are essential to wall that "reads" well. First of all it is      essential to break the joints. Then too, rock sizes should      be well proportioned and graded from the small "spans"      (rocks filled into spaces too small for regular sizes) to a      larger size stone that is proportional to the size of the      wall. Triangular-shaped stone, or long sliver-like      specimens should be placed so as to give a directional      vitality to the wall. A triangular stone with the apex      pointing down gives a more dynamic impression than if it      points up. A common error most amateur stone masons make is      to congregate the larger size rock near the base course and      finish the upper portion with progressively smaller and      smaller sizes. This is no design or style-looks like      the builder ran out of good material.    </p>        <p>      T he stone wall-panel illustrated here is an example of      better-than-average masonry. The rock forms are      natural-and thus restful-and rock sizes are      pleasingly proportioned to the total size of the panel.      Triangular, square and various other shapes are      thoughtfully distributed to create a dynamic, readable      composition. Deeply recessed joints assist<br />      the eye in its movement and re-grouping experience.<br />    </p>    <p>      The most obvious re-grouping consists of rocks 3, 11, 12,      10, 27, 18, 26 and 29. A readable directional quality is      attained without lining-up joints. Notice how rock 34      breaks the joint line between 19 and 33, 14 and 21, 6 and      16 and 8. Vitality is also achieved by strategically      placing triangular forms such as rocks 24, 11 and 30. The      downward pointing apex adds a dynamic "unbalanced" aspect      to the composition.    </p>    <p>      A final feature that qualifies this panel for professional      status is the thoughtful placement of base, corner and top      rock courses. Top corner rock 25, for instance, is more      massive than bottom corner rock 1. Base rocks 1 and 2 are      powered over by corner rock 9. Top rock 30 compliments its      lower neighbor rock 32, thereby creating a re-grouping      which consists of rocks 30, 32, 20 and part of 18.    </p>    <p>      A few detractive criticisms of this panel may also be in      order: Rock 43 is the only spall, or fragment, used even      though places exist for at least a half-dozen more, such as      between rocks 8 and 16 and between rocks 13 and 12. Notice      how beautifully spall 43 intergrates neighboring rocks 33,      38, 24 and 21. Corner rock 37 should never have been used:      The top slope makes it difficult to set the next corner      rock 39. The top corner rock 40 adds further to this      conflict: Its effect is to wedge rock 39 out at the top      while at the same time it appears to be slipping from its      bed. The left-hand side of this panel has much more      stability and grace than the right-hand side.    </p>    <p>      The sequence of rock laying is indicated numerically:      Notice that one begins at the left-hand corner and works to      the right. Corners are always set first and interior spaces      then filled in. Generally larger rocks are set first, with      smaller ones filled in around them. It is simpler to fit      smaller rocks around large ones than it is to find a place      for a large one.    </p>    <p>      Large rock 26, for instance, is bedded on rocks 17 and 18      and small rock 27 is set after the cavity has been fully      defined. Top rock 30 is temporarily propped into position      so that the top is level with the top of the wall. A filler      rock (32) is then found to fit the cavity. Small rocks,      especially spalls (see 43), are always set after the larger      rocks are in place.    </p>    <p>      Corners are always set first in wall work, and edges are      layed first in flatwork (such as slate floors). Below is an      illustrated sequence of stone layed in a typical wall      panel.    </p>    <p>      Once the basic mechanics of stone laying are mastered,      design subtleties in rock can be incorporated which add      immense interest to the building as well as enhanced value      to the masonry. The 8-foot square stone mosaic in our      living room (illustrated in the Epilog) was constructed of      white granite, brown sandstone, black slate and blue      river-rock. Except for such art-panels, the problem of      combining stone is generally a ticklish matter. Colors      should be harmonious. Ordinarily only stone of similar      hardness should be used.    </p>    <p>      In a building, a harmonious interplay of stone, wood and      glass is always sought. Stone should contrast with these      other building elements as well as with the native      surroundings. On a sloping site, for instance, a massive      stone foundation wall binds the building to the sloping      terrain; it links the natural landscape to the formal      discipline of the building.    </p>    <p>      Success in building with rock is not easy. But no material      blends as well with the natural environment or reveals the      personal artistry of the builder.    </p>        <p>      Stone walls should be treated with respect to the shape of      the building. The recently completed Woolman School social      hall (Nevada City, California) is a good example. It has      circular, cloverleaf-like wall panels and the roundish      building stone reaffirms the curvilinear motif. The outside      concrete walls of this building were constructed with a      sliding horizontal slip form, then faced with stone with a      layer of fiberglass insulation between. Barbwire ties      embedded in the concrete wall, form concrete and stone      facing into a homogeneous mass. The stone-faced circular      slip form construction methods developed on this project is      without doubt the best system for an inexperienced      Owner-Builder to tackle.    </p>    <h3>      INSIDE YOUR HOME    </h3>    <p>      <em>Modern architects have been harping continually on what      is different in our time to such an</em> <em>extent that      they have lost touch with what is not different, with what      is essentially the same.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Aldo van Eyck.</em>    </p>    <p>      Exciting changes are happening to the "interior design"      segment of new-era housing. Laotsu has been quoted      elsewhere as saying that the important part of a building      is not the walls and roof but the empty spaces inside. For      purposes of discussion we must differentiate between      <em>inside space</em> and <em>outside form.</em> Frank      Lloyd Wright said that what happened on the outside      occurred because of what was happening on the inside.      Houses should be designed essentially around what we do in      them.    </p>    <p>      Let us recognize, first of all, the animal nature of man;      we design to satisfy <em>needs</em> or, more simply, we      design to secure <em>comfort.</em> Heretofore, this book      has been devoted to aspects of achieving <em>physical</em>      comfort; something needs to be said for the even more      important concept of psychological comfort. The overall      effect upon one's senses and consciousness by interior      spaces defies definition, but it can be partially analyzed.      Sensory reactions to a room environment can be relaxing and      invigorating, or it can be disturbing.    </p>    <p>      The Owner-Builder who expects to attaina pleasing interior      environment should first of all not take himself too      seriously. His tone should be o ne of relaxed informality;      he should keep experimental and loose and, above all, the      creating (living) experience should be fun.    </p>    <p>      Architect Venturi goes even further; he claims that the      best architecture is not symmetrical or balanced; nor is it      clean and simple, logical and formalized. According to      Venturi, to achieve a vital and timely reality, the      architecture must contain what traditionalists would call      confusions and distortions; it must be complex,      "contradictory," ambiguous and contain downright "error" in      concept and execution!    </p>    <p>      Our reaction to an enclosed space is a reaction to size,      shape, light, color, openness, etc. To a space-sensitive      person a long and seemingly endless corridor is disturbing:      Anxiety is created because this type of space encourages      distortions of preception. Also, a space that does not have      a clearly defined size or shape can produce a feeling of      insecurity. A space should be immediately comprehensible.    </p>    <p>      The new look in building interiors is one of      <em>boldness</em> with lighting in design and color.      Lighting is no longer thought of in reference to mere      illumination. Rather, psychological relief and atmosphere      are prime concerns. Spots are employed to highlight or      wash; recessed "down-lights" create smug and sophisticated      qualities; table and floor lamps are works of sculpture.    </p>    <p>      On the one hand, we seek to create a psychologically      stimulating environment-yet on the other hand, the      space must not draw too much attention to <em>itself</em>      apart from its function in our home-life. It should      complement, not compete with, social contact. We all know      the hassel of personally competing with many so-called      "conversation pieces."    </p>        <p>      The need for genuine social contact, and also for privacy,      in our living environment is of uppermost importance. In      each case, a satisfactory experience is possible only by      freeing our environment of all barriers. Alienation is      aggravated by a bad spatial environment, and relieved by a      good spatial environment. Circulation paths should be laid      out so as to provide people with contact to all activities.      An immediate work space should have a visual relation to      the total space. A face-to-face personal contact can      sometimes be furthered by the simple use of adjustable      furniture.    </p>    <p>      Some furniture items can be advantageously mounted on      wheels. But wherever possible use built-ins-they go      far in eliminating the furniture clutter. Consolidation of      furnishings is an attractive concept to people who are      unencumbered by conventional trappings. Dispensing with the      usual traditional paraphernalia has economic as well as      social implications.    </p>        <p>      There is a major economic advantage in building minimal      rather than fulsome interiors. The elimination of interior      non-essentials radically miniaturizes dimensions. Some      noteworthy concepts are called Room-within-a-room,      Mini-room, and Living-centers.    </p>    <p>      Living-centers consist of clustering equipment and      furniture into the central portion of a room. Furniture is      consolidated instead of scattered around the perimeter. A      Living-center contains "systems" furniture that does even      more than synthesize and consolidate furniture and      equipment. It provides a fresh, revolutionary view of the      whole "furniture" concept. In a Living-center the furniture      may very well consist of movable trays or platforms. They      can be wheeled or slid or taken apart into various pieces      or laid out in different ways. One polyfunctional      Living-center may thus become a living, dining, sleeping,      or study area.    </p>    <p>      This new-era furnishing concept is contrasted to current      furniture arrangement practices in about the same way that      a mobile-home furnishing arrangement relates to the      interior of a boat. A boat is designed to utilize total      space; emenities are built-in. The space in a boat is small      but highly integrated. The mobile-home, on the otherhand,      is also small in space, but it is furnished with the usual      assortment of standard-sized appliances and furnishings.      The basic prefabricated shell does not carry through to the      inside.    </p>    <p>      Possibly the most satisfying sense of all is the sense of      privacy. This refers to visual and acoustical privacy as      well as spatial (touch) privacy. In this regard there is      real danger in too much modern-day "open planning." Aldo      van Eyck has said:    </p>    <p>      We must break away from the contemporary concept of spatial      continuity, and the tendency to erase every articulation      between spaces, i.e., outside and inside, between one space      and another. Instead, the transition must be articulated by      defining the in-between places which induce simultaneous      awareness of what is significant on either side.    </p>    <p>      My endo-space, meso-space, ecto-space approach may help to      clarify this concept, but continuing on may prove more      confusing than helpful to the average Owner-Builder.      Suffice it to say that the inside    </p>    <p>      tions should be allowed to change. Flexibility is the key      here. Flexibility to satisfy all our senses and all our      moods and life-programs. We need to sit in different ways      at different times; and at different periods of life we      need different places and arrangements for eating and      sleeping.    </p>    <p>      When a Living-center "systems" furnishing is not employed,      a room's floor should be kept bare; things can be stored      out of the way conveniently in wall storage cabinets. Rooms      too often become centers for the display of possessions. If      passage areas are expanded into usable alcoves, the size of      other rooms can be reduced, thereby saving on construction      costs. Costs are also reduced by eliminating reveals and      mouldi ngs-"trim." Flush, frameless window and door      openings and broad expanses of plain surfaces also      contribute to this end. Remember, a poorly designed      interior cannot do permanent damage to a well-designed      house-but it can surely ruin it for the duration of      its occupancy.    </p>    <p>      One final word: Frank Lloyd Wright has said that corners      put an end to space. This is a concept worthy of      contemplation. It just may be that some of the exciting      spatial features mentioned above can be achieved in a      straightwalled structure only with the greatest difficulty      and compromise. I have had sufficient design experience to      appreciate the fact that a rectangular or cubic room is      about the most depressing space imaginable, while a      circular, curvilinear, or organic space-though it may      seem novel or difficult to constructfeels <em>right</em>      just in its own pure and simple "undesigned" form.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of      importance) <em><br />      Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture:</em> Robert      Venturi, 1966 <em><br />      The Hidden Dimension:</em> Edward Hall, 1966    </p>    <h3>      EPILOG    </h3>    <p>      This epilog to <em>The Owner-Built Home</em> series is at      the same time a prolog to my forthcoming book, <em>The      Owner-Built Homestead,</em> now being written. It is idle      to speculate on building one's own home in the city or      suburb. One would be pounced upon by various officials      before the first nail could be driven. Despotic union      bosses and mercenary contractors' association scouts would      soon squelch any do-it-yourself building      activity-assuming the banker and building inspector      would go so far as to authorize the work.    </p>        <p>      The factors that hamper and outlaw the owner-builder      project in urban areas form only one small part of the      argument for "rural living" solutions. Very soon in the      construction process an owner-builder finds that positive      resources are required that can come only from a rural      environment in a more or less natural and friendly      community. The two m ost important resources are      <em>freedom</em> and <em>health</em> . An urban      two-day-a-week, two-week-a-year home building program is      next to worthless. One needs a <em>block</em> of free time      to build a home. One also needs the energy and well-being      that can come only with good nutrition, fresh air and clean      water.    </p>    <p>      So a rural setting can verily support an owner-builder in a      sort dovetailing set of circumstances. A family buys an      acreage of land in hinterland where land is not so      expensive. Taxes are therefore not so high. Building      regulations are almost non-existent; so only moderate      construction funds need be amassed. The land can be made      productive and so cash need be earned for foodstuffs, thus      allowing more time and money to be spent on building and      land development. Nutritious food raised on the land can      improve the family health, and thus more energy available      for greater homestead development.    </p>    <p>      In a few years a family should be happily situated on its      own debt-free home. How it should go about developing the      (garden, orchard, pasture, woodlot), water supply, fencing,      barns and buildings will be the subject of <em>The      Owner-Built Homestead.</em>    </p>    <p>      The idea of a family earning its economic necessaries from      a homestead (with a part-time money income to supply      amenities which cannot be family produced) goes back to      depression years when Roosevelt's Federal Security      Administration dabbled in "subsistence farmsteads." But a      much more significant contribution to this back-to-the-land      movement was made by pioneers like Ralph Borsodi and Milton      Wend.    </p>        <p>      Ralph Borsodi an d the books he wrote in the 30s (and      since) helped shape the homestead trend. Economist Borsodi      established his family homestead 25 miles above New York      City in 1921, and saw the need for smal-lscale technology      to help revive productive living. In 1929 he wrote his      famous critique of modern culture <em>This Ugly      Civilization,</em> and suggested that the small homestead      was a human and constructive way out of the urban pressures      he saw developing. All this was popularized in his      <em>Flight from the City</em> , in 1938 (and later      printings).    </p>    <p>      Borsodi, in effect, dropped the idea and reality of the      modern homestead into the social pool in the 30s. The      ripples of that act have spread far. Some of those      affected, who have since spread the idea, included Milton      Wend, Ed Robinson, J. I. Rodale, Paul Keene, Agnes Toms,      Elizabeth Nutting and Mildred Loomis. Borsodi established      the first School of Living near Suffern, N. Y., in 1937, to      do research in how to live, to build homesteading      communities, and to develop a curriculum for a new      education for living.<br />    </p>    <p>      Milton Wend, now of Edgartown, Mass., was a trustee of the      first School of Living. His experiences and ideas were      reported in his <em>How to Live in the Country Without      Farming.</em> The book has been widely read. Wend is still      active in his Human Engineering Institute.    </p>    <p>      Ed Robinson took over the idea from a School of Living      brochure entitled <em>Have More Vegetables,</em> and      developed his famous "Have More Plan" and country life      bookstore. After a flourishing business, this was      discontinued in the 50s.    </p>        <p>      J. I. Rodale visited the School of Living in 1938, and      there saw the composted gardens, the use of whole foods,      the grinding of grain into flour and cereal, and the      regular baking of whole-meal bread. He went back to Emmaus,      Pa., and later changed his publishing emphasis to gardening      and homesteading. The magnificent growth and influence of      the Rodale publishing enterprises are well-known today.    </p>    <p>      Mildred Jensen (Loomis) was assistant educational director      of the Suffern School of Living (1938-40) and later      continued that work avocationally at her home, Lane's End      Homestead, near Brookville, Ohio. Her editing of journals      <em>(The Interpreter, Balanced Living,</em> etc.) began in      1944 and continues in 1966 with the monthly <em>Green      Revolution</em> and the bimonthly <em>A Way Out.</em> The      numbers of people who have been influenced to the homestead      way from these, and her book, <em>Go Ahead and Live!,</em>      are uncounted. Some of the successful homesteads which have      grown out of this work will be described and detailed in      <em>The Owner-Built Homestead.</em>    </p>    <p>      During the depression of the 30s and 40s, books like      <em>Five Acres and Independence</em> carried on Borsodi's      early emphasis. But unfortunately these early writers and      promoters of country life did not produce a dominant trend      in our country. Why?    </p>    <p>      The reasons are many. The technological drift of the modern      day had attained a momentum that could not be stopped by a      trickle of counter-ideas. And the form and content of the      discourse about rural living in the 30s and 40s were of a      pre-depression vintage. Traditional living-patterns were      dressed up in a "country living" format and presented as a      bonafide original. Many would-be homesteaders became      disillusioned.    </p>    <p>      There was no qualified, professional or educational      assistance in the homestead movement. One exception to this      was an architectural competition for a productive      homestead, sponsored by the early <em>Free America</em>      magazine.    </p>    <p>      So the first wave of homesteading interest in the late 30s      and 40s diminished. Some leaders in the movement seemed to      drift into specialized aspects such as organic gardening,      nutrition or craft production. This was probably aided by      the seemingly narrow and limited nature and understanding      of homesteading. People thought that no earth-shaking      revolution-or revelation-could ever come out of      a potato patch!    </p>    <p>      Moreover, the high employment and Social Security benefits      offered by the Great Society of the USA, with its      war-making "power elite," tend to dissuade people from a      life on the land. Government handouts in the city appear to      be easier to accept than living by one's wits in the rural      margins and "cracks of an affluent society."    </p>    <p>      But the urban culture of the war-making, land-owning, and      money-owning "power elite" is now riding to a fall, as      anyone who reads the newspapers can see. The overpopulated      sinks of the city's poor naturally spawn riots. There      <em>must</em> come a change. The homestead and      village-community type of life that was disrupted at the      dawn of history by the ravages of hunter-chieftains and      warrior-kings from their city strongholds will have to be      <em>restored-</em> with the addition, of course, of our      present world-wide communication, free peaceful enterprise,      scientific vision and ingenious technology.    </p>    <p>      <em>The Owner-Built Homestead</em> is intended to be a      <em>how to think it</em> as well as a <em>how to do it</em>      book. In addition, a personalized homestead-layout service      is offered, showing long-range site-development plans to      fit the homesteader's property, soil conditions, regional      climate conditions, and specific personal requirements. It      is hoped that each reader will avail himself of the      opportunity to have a fully detailed home and homestead      plan, designed exclusively to his own site and needs.    </p>    <p>      THE OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD<br />      <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      It has been ten years since I first started writing <em>THE      OWNERBUILT HOME.</em> At the outset of writing this first      book there was some suggestion to expand it to include home      <em>food</em> production along with the central theme of      home <em>shelter</em> production. At that time the "back to      the land" sentiment was all but dead in this country. So I      brushed off the suggestion, and awaited with others an      economic depression to revive the attitude of economic      self-reliance. Theoretically, when great numbers of people      lose their jobs and have only breadlines and welfare      handouts to look to for sustenance, they will then      consider, perhaps, home food-production. So for all these      years I've been waiting for the expected catastrophe: It      would highlight a widespread social need and orient my      research effort toward fulfilling this need.    </p>    <p>      The kind of economic depression we pictured never, as you      know. came off. On the contrary, purchasing power and      employment in this country reached an all time high. But      something far more serious has occurred; the beginnings of      a world revolution. The past ten years has witnessed a      many-sided challenge to the whole      military-financial-urban-real-estate complex. The student      rebellion, the minority revolts, the breakdown of urban      America, and the mounting concern for the environment have      led to an increasing exodus to the country-side.    </p>    <p>      More and more, retired and semi-retired people are looking      to the small acreage. They are literally driven there by      urban sprawl, noise, smog, high taxes, and inflation. The      chaotic political state of the world stimulates many people      to search for a more meaningful and natural value system.    </p>    <p>      There is another and more significant group of fresh      recruits for rural living: The countless college students      who have become disillusioned with their professional      college training, shocked by our murderous war machine and      alerted to the money-grabbing, life-negative forces within      the establishment. I speak of the intelligent and able      drop-outs, the turned-on, do-your-own-thing generation. It      is chiefly for this dynamic and thoughtful generation, as      well as for the mere refugees from the city, that I write      this book on productive homesteading; an integral      arrangement of earth, plants, animals, buildings and      utilities.    </p>    <p>      In basic terms, I'm setting out here to promote the      <em>post modern way of country living.</em> It is a life of      self-reliance and at least partial economic      self-sufficiency, but <em>in a social and ecological      context.</em> Naturally, I'm attempting to sell these ideas      to any and all. But the prospective buyer must have minimal      emotional and technical potential and be in good position      to leave the city. He must be fairly intelligent and have      strong motivation and drive as well as ability to do manual      work.    </p>    <p>      These requirements-especially being up to manual      work-are, of course, seldom met by current youth.      Their reaction against intellectualism is strong enough;      but they just lack the manual skill and discipline-training      necessary to satisfy their most basic needs. It is really      tragic to observe so many mentally qualified young couples      failing in their attempts to live on the land. In starting      out they have no concept of step one-actual      work-much less the whole complex of plant-animal-soil      relationships, plus production-storage-processing, which      takes the most knowledgeable and experienced farmer. Their      failure disillusions them with the homestead scene, and      they may react this time <em>against</em> the materials and      tools and skills associated with living on the land. Thus      the escapist talk nowadays about segregated tribal      communes, primitive living, etc. They hate the computerized      urban existence, and can't make it in the all-round      homestead life; so the next step is to live isolated with      fellow-failures.    </p>    <p>      This book, then, is an attempt to bridge the gap between      primitive inability and a <em>wholesome</em> use of      science, technique, and civilization. After answering the      why and the where of homesteading, I intend to analyze into      its components <em>a balanced homestead environment</em>      -from human and animal shelter forms to crop      production and utility functions.    </p>    <p>      I propose, next, a descriptive evaluation of sensible      techniques and routines of productive homesteading.    </p>    <p>      The tragedy of the homestead movement is having      enthusiastic but ill-prepared people attempt a life on the      land. To start with, the land they choose may not be      adapted to the type of gardening or animal production they      have in mind: They may innocently choose wrong soil and      fertilizer types, insufficient or inefficient irrigation      systems, inappropriate shelter forms, wrong tools and      equipment. Efficient home production requires a concise      what-to-do and how-to-do-it program.    </p>    <p>      At least in one small way a homesteader competes with his      commercial farm neighbor, and yet how can a      homesteader-come-lately ever expect to be as knowledgeable      and efficient in his production as a full-time life-long      experienced farmer? It is possible. He may be even more      effective and advanced. Through proper design and planning      practices, and through work simplification, an      inexperienced homesteader can <em>become</em> more      efficient in <em>living and livelihood</em> than a      commercial farmer.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, today's ordinary farming practices are      miserably <em>inefficient and wasteful.</em> The most      famous study on this subject was made by Dr. Carter at the      Vermont Experiment Station in 1943. For 4 months he studied      the work practices of a 22-herd dairy farmer. Then with an      investment of $50-which went mostly for a      rearrangement of stables, tools and supplies-Carter      reduced chore-time from 5 hours to 3 hours a day. Daily      walking distance was reduced from 3 miles to 1 mile. In      total, 760 man-hours and 730 miles of walking were saved in      one year. This Vermont study should encourage the      prospective homesteader with an awareness of how his own      food production program can be arranged with minimal chore      labor and maximal personal satisfaction.    </p>    <p>      Yet I would not wish to close this Introduction by giving      the impression that one develops a homestead merely through      knowledge and efficient effort. In reality, the      design-development concept must be <em>regained</em> rather      than <em>acquired.</em> A first lesson of Zen tells us      more: The concept can be regained only by <em>allowing      things to happen.</em> In a very real sense the homestead      that I intend to present is an ecological      <em>happening.</em> Your brainy body is only one little      organism in the big natural and social world. It cannot      <em>command,</em> but it can, indeed, promote harmonious      and creative adjustment.    </p>
