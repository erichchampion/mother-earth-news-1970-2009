                  <h3> COUNTRY LORE</h3>    <p>      For buggy days and sultry nights, readers have the answers.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      ILLUSTRATIONS BY CLAUDIA TANTILLO    </h5>    <p>      I cut down on weeding chores by buying sunflower seeds and      sprinkling them in the weedy, grassy areas of my perennial      flower beds. Squirrels and birds love this treat, and all      those paws and claws scratching through the soil discourage      weeds and grass from sprouting. The hulls left behind act      as an enriching mulch, too. This works on perennial      vegetable beds as well.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Mrs. H. Henselin<br />      Chatfield, Minnesota</em>    </p>  <h3> Let It Flow</h3>    <p>      Most prescription drugs and some vitamins are packaged in      bottles that each contain a crystal-filled capsule that      absorbs moisture and keeps the pills fresh. Once a bottle's      contents are used up, the capsule can be placed in a salt      or pepper shaker to keep the seasonings dry in damp      weather.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Portia Crider<br />      Jackson, South Carolina</em>    </p>       <h3> Color Me Red</h3>    <p>      How I used to hate preparing beets for freezer storage!      Before the job was over I'd be covered with beet juice and      so would my cutting board and countertops. Last year,      though, I tried two utensils meant for other uses and they      worked perfectly. Once the beets were cooked and tender, I      cut the larger ones into strips with my wire French-fry      cutter and made nice even slices of the smaller ones with      my metal egg slicer. It's an easy way to make short work of      a messy job.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Bonnie Gelle<br />      Grand Rapids, Minnesota</em>    </p>       <h3> Mosquitoes, Gnats and Ticks</h3>    <p>      An old country formula to ward off gnats and mosquitoes is      to mix a tablespoon of vanilla extract into a cup of water.      I rubbed this on my children's faces, even as babies, and      it worked so well I tried the solution on my horse. Applied      around her ears and eyes, it kept flies away.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Joan Chevalier<br />      McEwan, Tennessee</em>    </p>    <p>      Pin a fabric softener sheet to the back of your collar or      on your hat. It looks funny, but it sure keeps mosquitoes      away.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Tim Wacker<br />      Alliance, Nebraska</em>    </p>    <p>      For bug bites or for ticks, reach for a deodorant spray      containing aluminum chloro-hydrate. Sprayed on a bite, it      will take away the pain and swelling (not the itch,      however, but you can't have everything!). If a tick has      taken up residence in your skin, give the insect a squirt      and in a moment or two it will crawl out where you can pick      it off.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Harriett Boggs<br />      Fordland, Missouri</em>    </p>    <p>      When I lived in the Ozark Mountains I was plagued by ticks.      I could hardly leave the house without two or three of them      attaching themselves to me. A local old-timer suggested I      drink a quart of buttermilk every day. He claimed it would      change the chemical composition of my perspiration so as to      repel ticks. I'm not sure if this is true, but after trying      his remedy, I never had another tick bite.    </p>    <p>      <em>-R. Hersted<br />      Portola, California</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pass the Zuckles</strong>    </p>    <p>      Like most gardeners, I always end up with too many      zucchini. So I substitute the squash for cucumbers in my      favorite recipes for relish and bread-and-butter pickles.      No one ever can tell the difference.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Donna N. Swanson<br />      Portsmouth, Virginia</em>    </p>   <h3> Tender Skin</h3>    <p>      I guess the threat of stinging hornets is the price we pay      for all the pleasures of summer. But I've learned a way to      cope-with the sting, at least. If I get stung, I      immediately wring out a towel in hot water and sprinkle a      generous portion of meat tenderizer on the towel. This I      apply directly to the sting, retreating the towel every      five minutes for about half an hour. The hot towel causes      the pores of my skin to open, and the tenderizer      neutralizes the venom. If I do this quickly enough after      the hornet's attack, there is no pain and no swelling.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Guy DeVault<br />      Fort Collins, Colorado</em>    </p>       <h3> Bubbles That Kill</h3>    <p>      Our farm was invaded by rats and mice, and we were at our      wits' end after trying to eradicate them with no success.      An elderly neighbor suggested setting out shallow pans of      nondiet cola. Sure enough, the rodents loved the sugary      liquid, drank it greedily and within a few days were dead.      They evidently can't burp, so the carbonation bloats their      bodies and kills them. It's an inexpensive solution, and      safe to use around pets and farm animals.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Ruth Riley<br />      Seattle, Washington</em>    </p>   <h3> Slick Trick</h3>    <p>      Lightly coat the underside of your power lawn mower with a      no-stick cooking spray. Less grass adhering to the mower      will make for an easier job.    </p>    <p>      <em>-D. Gallagher<br />      Apple Creek, Ohio</em>    </p>   <h3> Sleep Like a Baby</h3>    <p>      Some summer nights are so sultry even the sheets stick to      your body. Try sprinkling baby powder between your sheets;      you'll find you rest more comfortably. To cut costs, use a      generic brand of powder and mix it half-and-half with      cornstarch.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Don Busby<br />      Bulverde, Texas</em>    </p>       <h3>Bitter Cukes</h3>    <p>      My French-Canadian grandmother-in-law had a trick for      removing the bitter taste from cucumbers. She'd cut off a      one-and-a-half-inch section from one end and rub it rapidly      and firmly back and forth over the cut end of the longer      portion. The suction draws out a white substance, which you      then wash off the main piece, discarding the cut tip.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Sheri Perkins<br />      Anoka, Minnesota</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Through the years we've all discovered a few practical,      time-tested solutions to the frustrating little problems of      everyday life.
