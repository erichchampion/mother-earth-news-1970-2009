           		<p>SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</p>         <p>      Studies worldwide mean better gardens for you.<br />     </p>		 <h5 id="byline">By Greg and Pat Williams</h5>        <p>      Scientists at several institutions are involved with NASA's      Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) program.      The goal of this undertaking is to find the best crops for      astronauts to grow in future space stations. Purdue      University researchers evaluated over 100 plant species on      the basis of yield, nutrient composition, disease      resistance-and, yes, even taste. They're now focusing      on hydroponic <em>lettuce</em> grown using the      "recirculating nutrient film technique." In precisely      controlled environments, leaf lettuce has matured in as few      as 19 days-allowing 16 crops per year! New enhancements      such as special lights tailored to the photosynthetic needs      of lettuce are expected to boost growth rates ever further.    </p>    <p>      Lettuce is the quick-growth champion, but what are the      other "space-efficient" crops? The results aren't all in,      but scientists are currently studying white potatoes (at      the University of Wisconsin), sweet potatoes (Tuskegee      Institute), wheat (University of California at Davis) and      soybeans (North Carolina State). So far, wheat has been      grown in only 65 days and soybeans in 80.    </p>    <p>      A more down-to-earth approach to efficient food raising is      presented in David Duhon's book <em>One Circle: How to Grow      a Complete Diet in Less Than 1,000 Square Feet</em> ($9      postpaid from Ecology Action, 5798 Ridgewood Rd., Willits,      CA 95490). Duhon examines and gives complete growing      information for 14 crops with high potential for use in      "minimal area" gardens. Six of these-potatoes,      sunflowers, onions, turnips, parsnips and      garlic-could conceivably provide a woman's complete,      balanced diet for one year from just a 550-square-foot      garden! (Duhon's other "wonder crops" are collards,      filberts, leeks, parsley, peanuts, soybeans, sweet potatoes      and wheat.)    </p>    <p>      Additional sections of <em>One Circle</em> show how to      design full-nutrition gardens that provide a bit more      mealtime diversity. If you want to learn how to get maximum      food value from minimum land, Duhon's book is the place to      start.    </p>  <h3> Research Briefs</h3>    <p>      <strong>I heard it on the grapevine</strong> . The Acoustic      Emission Technology Corporation in California wants to take      advantage of the recently discovered phenomenon that plants      emit <em>audible</em> responses to water stress. AETC is      trying to design machines that guide grape irrigation      schedules according to when the vines say, "We're thirsty."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gypsy moth barriers</strong> . Studies in a      Pennsylvania oak forest during a gypsy moth infestation      have shown that caterpillar build-up on individual trees      can be greatly reduced by placing barriers around the      trunks three feet above the ground. Encircling bands can be      made from a sticky material such as Tan-gletrap, from      double-sided aluminum foil tape or from burlap strips      folded in half.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Is it real... or Weyerhaeuser?</strong> The rumors      are true-the Weyerhaeuser Diversified Business Group      is planning to market "embalmed" plants! A patented      preservation process developed in Sweden gives plants a      fresh, live look even though they're actually dead. No more      worries about watering, soil quality, light or pests, just      plant 'em and forget 'em. The first plants were treated      about eight years ago and still look fresh. Weyerhaeuser      claims the chemicals used in the process are nonpoisonous.      These "living dead" techno-wonders are coming soon to a      mall near you.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stinging nettle tea works</strong> . Plant      physiologists in Sweden watered plants potted in sand or a      peat-and-sand mixture with either an aqueous extract of      stinging nettle plants or a nutrient solution with the      <em>same</em> macro-and micronutrient composition as the      nettle water. The results? The shoots watered with real      nettle water had about 20% greater fresh weight (with 15%      more nitrogen). Leaves had higher chlorophyll levels, and      the growing medium had greater microbial activity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Don't plant asparagus . . . yet</strong> . Wait      until the new Greenwich cultivar is commercially available      from Nourse Farms (Box 485 RFD, South Deerfield, ME 01373).      Why? Trials show that Greenwich produces about twice the      yield (and more large spears) of Mary Washington, the      current standard.    </p>  <h3> Gleanings</h3>    <p>      Need to cart a critter far away from your garden?

According to Rohilah Guy's new booklet ($6      postpaid from Bio-Planting, Inc., 2719 Acton, Berkeley, CA      94702), the Bach flower remedies-normally used to      enhance human moods and health-can be used to      encourage plant growth, improve flowering and help prevent      pest and disease problems.... Don't start climbing branches      until you read <em>The Tree Worker's Manual</em> ($8.50      postpaid from the Ohio Agricultural Education Curriculum      Materials Service, Ohio State University, Room 254, 2120      Fyffe Rd., Columbus, OH 43210). Its information on      equipment, climbing techniques, tree treatment and safety      is unsurpassed. . . . Want to support genetic diversity of      valuable food crops? The Grain Exchange (2440 E. Water Well      Rd., Salina, KS 67401; annual membership, $7.50) runs a      seed exchange of old and unusual grain seeds, maintains a      germ plasm collection and publishes a newsletter.    </p>    <p>      <em>Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their food on a      small farm and publish Hort-Ideas, a fine newsletter on      gardening research and products ($10 a year from G. &      P.
