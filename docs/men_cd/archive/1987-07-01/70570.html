                    <p>      <em>An easy way to bottle up some of your garden's best      moments.</em>    </p>        <p>      Pickles capture the essence of summer. They can be spicy as      a breeze off the flower bed, or sharp as sudden lightning;      sweet as slow July evenings, hot as long August nights.      When you put up pickles, you preserve, warm memories for      the cold days ahead.    </p>    <p>      Pickling is an easy way of "putting food by." The recipes      here are all for fresh-pack, or quick-process,      pickles-which you can turn out in an      afternoon-rather than for brined, or fermented,      pickles, which may take several weeks. Each recipe involves      merely cleaning and cutting the vegetables to appropriate      lengths; preparing a vinegar-based pickling liquid; packing      the vegetables and liquid in containers; and either      immersing the jars in boiling water for a few minutes or      allowing the pickles to age in the refrigerator until their      flavors have mellowed.    </p>    <p>      Before you gather up all those excess vegetables your      garden is producing and go to work, get hold of a good      canning guide. The standard one is the USDA's <em>Complete      Guide to Home Canning, Preserving and Freezing</em> ($4.80      postpaid from Dover Publications, 180 Varick St., New York,      NY 10014). A few tips should serve to give you an idea of      what you're getting into.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ingredients:</strong> Vegetables should be fresh,      firm and free of mold and blemishes. If possible, use only      pickling (pure granulated) salt; it has no iodine (which      darkens the pickles) or anticaking agents (which cloud the      liquid). If pickling salt is unavailable, just use      non-iodized table salt and resign yourself to murky brine.      Vinegar must be between 4% and 6% acid; homemade or gourmet      vinegars of unknown acidity simply aren't safe as      preservatives. Either white or cider vinegar will do,      according to your taste; white is preferable for      light-colored vegetables, since cider will darken them. If      you use garlic (as several recipes call for), keep in mind      that it harbors bacteria that can cause spoilage. Before      adding it to the jars, peel the cloves and boil them for 1      minute in water or in the vinegar solution.    </p>   <h3>PICKLES</h3>		<p>      <strong><em>Don't stop at cukes. Pickle zukes, tomatoes,      carrots, beans and peas.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Utensils:</strong> Pans for heating the pickling      liquid should be enamel, stainless steel or glass, copper,      galvanized or iron utensils may produce off-colors or form      undesirable compounds. You'll need a water-bath      canner-a large pot with a tight-fitting lid and a      rack to hold canning jars. (Inexpensive models -$10      or so-are often available at discount and hardware      stores.) Jars should be the kind sold specifically for home      canning: glass jars with two-piece metal caps (a flat metal      lid and a metal screw band). <em>Don't</em> reuse leftover      containers from supermarket foods; they won't seal      properly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Processing:</strong> Pack and seal the jars as the      manufacturer directs. Usually, this means filling each jar      to within ½ inch of the rim, wiping the rim clean of      all food particles, placing the lid on the jar with the      sealing compound down and screwing the metal band on tight.      Immerse the filled jars in boiling water in the canner      (there should be 1 or 2 inches of water above the jars),      cover the pot, bring the water back to boiling and boil the      jars gently for the time specified in the recipe. (Start      timing when the water returns to a boil.) Remove the jars      from the canner and check to make sure that the lids have      sealed properly; again, follow the manufacturer's      directions. Most lids form a small depression in the center      as they seal-giving off a "pop" as they do so.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Storing:</strong> Allow the pickles to cool for 12      to 24 hours, then remove the screw bands and store the jars      in a dark, cool place. Pickles improve with age; let them      sit for 2 or 3 months before eating them. Because the      vinegar solutions are highly acid, few bacteria can live in      them. Even so, be alert for signs of spoilage: Discard      <em>untasted</em> any food from jars with leakage, bulging      lids or spurting liquid.    </p>    <p>      A shelf full of pickles-with their rich reds,      brilliant greens, bright golds and warm browns-can      brighten a gray January day. So put some summer in your      pantry. Make pickles!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Super-Good and Extra-Easy Dill      Pickles</strong><br />      4 pounds cucumbers<br />      3 cups white vinegar<br />      3 cups water<br />      1/3 cup salt<br />      For each pint jar:<br />      2 tablespoons dill seed<br />      3 peppercorns<br />      1 or 2 dried cayenne peppers (optional)    </p>    <p>      Wash cucumbers. Depending on your preferences and the size      of the cucumbers, either leave them whole or cut them in      half or into spears.    </p>    <p>      Combine vinegar, water and salt, and heat to the boiling      point. Pack the cucumbers into hot, clean jars. Add dill      seed, peppercorns and peppers (if desired). Seal the jars      and process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Makes      6-8 pints.    </p>    <p>      Note: For kosher dills, add 1 clove of garlic to each pint      jar.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Debra A. Mackiewicz<br />      Piedmont, Kansas</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bread-and-Butter Zucchini</strong><br />      6 pounds medium-size zucchini<br />      1½ cups sliced white onions<br />      2 large garlic cloves<br />      1/3 cup salt<br />      2 quarts (2 trays) ice, crushed or cubes<br />      4 cups sugar<br />      l½ teaspoons turmeric<br />      1½ teaspoons celery seed<br />      2 tablespoons mustard seed<br />      3 cups white vinegar    </p>    <p>      Wash and drain zucchini. Slice ¼-inch thick,      discarding ends. Add onions and garlic. Add salt and mix      thoroughly; cover with crushed ice or ice cubes; let stand      3 hours. Drain thoroughly; remove garlic cloves.    </p>    <p>      Combine sugar, spices and vinegar; heat just to boiling.      Add drained zucchini and onion slices and heat 5 minutes.      Pack hot pickles loosely into clean, hot pint jars to      ½ inch of top. Seal and process in a boiling water      bath for 5 minutes. Makes 6-8 pints.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hot Herbed Carrots</strong><br />      4 hot peppers<br />      4 cloves garlic<br />      1 teaspoon rosemary<br />      2 pounds baby carrots (or 2 pounds larger carrots cut in      4-inch lengths)<br />      2 cups water<br />      2 cups white vinegar<br />      3 tablespoons sugar<br />      3 tablespoons salt    </p>    <p>      Halve the peppers lengthwise. In each of 4 pint jars, put 1      pepper, 1 garlic clove and ¼ teaspoon rosemary. Pack      jars full of carrots. Combine water, vinegar, sugar and      salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5      minutes. Pour liquid over carrots, seal and process in a      boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Makes 4 pints.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dilled Green Beans</strong><br />      4 pounds (about 4 quarts) whole green beans    </p>    <p>      For each pint jar:<br />      ¼ teaspoon hot red pepper, crushed<br />      ½ teaspoon mustard seed<br />      ½ teaspoon dill seed (or 1 dill head)<br />      1 clove garlic<br />      5 cups vinegar<br />      5 cups water<br />      ½ cup salt    </p>    <p>      Wash beans thoroughly; drain and cut into lengths that will      fit into pint jars. Pack the beans in clean, hot jars. Add      red pepper, mustard seed, dill seed and garlic.    </p>    <p>      Combine vinegar, water and salt; heat to boiling. Pour      boiling liquid over beans, seal and process in a boiling      water bath for 5 minutes. Makes 6-8 pints.    </p>   <h3>Tangy Mixed Mushrooms</h3>    <p>      Little button mushrooms make a pretty pickle, but their      flavor is not in the same league with that of boletus      mushrooms, dried specimens of which are used here to lend      their fine, dark taste and deep, earthy color. Look for      dried mushrooms labeled cepes, porcini, boletus and so on.    </p>    <p>      2 pounds small, firm white button mushrooms<br />      1 ounce (about 2/3 cup) dried porcini, cepes or other dried      boletus mushrooms<br />      4 cups water<br />      3 teaspoons salt<br />      l½ cups red wine vinegar<br />      l½ cups distilled white vinegar 3 large cloves      garlic, peeled and halved<br />      2 dozen black or white peppercorns<br />      6 medium bay leaves<br />      9 whole cloves<br />      3 large blades mace    </p>    <p>      Wipe the button mushrooms clean with a damp cloth and trim      the bases of the stems. Combine the mushrooms, dried      boletes, water and l½ teaspoons of the salt in a      large saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered,      until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the whole business      into a bowl, let cool, then cover and refrigerate      overnight.    </p>    <p>      Drain the mushrooms in a colander set over a bowl (save the      liquid for a delicious soup or sauce base). Either remove      the pieces of boletus or leave them mixed with the buttons;      although not comely, the pieces are delicious.    </p>    <p>      Combine the remaining salt with the two vinegars and the      seasonings in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and      simmer 5 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, divide the drained mushrooms among heatproof      storage jars that have snug lids. Divide the seasonings      from the boiling-hot pickling liquid equally among the      jars, then pour the spiced vinegar over the mushrooms. The      liquid should cover them well; if not, add a little more      vinegar or water. Let cool, cover jars and refrigerate to      mellow for at least 3 days before using. At serving time,      you may want to drain the mushrooms and toss them with a      little olive oil. Makes about 3 pints and keeps for up to 6      months in the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pickled Sugar Snaps</strong><br />      Although the sugar snaps are not processed, they will keep      indefinitely in the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      12 ounces sugar snap peas<br />      2 cloves garlic<br />      2 teaspoons yellow mustard seed<br />      Several sprigs of fresh dill<br />      1 medium onion, sliced thin<br />      1 fresh or 2 dried hot red peppers<br />      1 cup white vinegar<br />      ½ cup water<br />      1 teaspoon salt    </p>    <p>      String the sugar snap peas by cutting the stem end off with      a small, sharp knife and continuing around the sides,      pulling the string off in one motion. This goes very      quickly.    </p>    <p>      In the bottom of a quart jar or crock, place the garlic and      mustard seed. Begin adding the peas, the dill and the onion      alternately. At some point, add the hot red pepper so that      it will look attractive in the arrangement. Continue until      all the peas have been used and the container is firmly      packed.    </p>    <p>      Mix the vinegar, water and salt together. Stir until the      salt is completely dissolved. Pour over the peas. If you      need more liquid to cover the vegetables completely, add      more vinegar.    </p>    <p>      Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 months before using.      If you sample before this time, you will probably be      disappointed, as they will not have had time to develop the      desired flavor or crispness. Makes 1 quart.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Jalapeño Pepper Relish</strong><br />      This relish is very hot, but perfect with Mexican food,      pita combinations and potato dishes.    </p>    <p>      1½ pounds jalapeño peppers 2 pounds green      tomatoes<br />      ¼ cup salt    </p>    <p>      Wash and dry peppers and tomatoes. Remove caps from peppers      and cut into 3 or 4 chunks, but don't seed them. (If your      fingers are sensitive, wear rubber gloves while handling      the peppers.) Core the tomatoes but don't peel or seed      them; cut into chunks the same size as the peppers.    </p>    <p>      Grind the vegetables together in a food processor or put      them through the medium blade of a food mill. Do not grind      too thoroughly, as the mixture should be crunchy, not      mushy.<br />      Put the mixture into a saucepan and add salt and vinegar.      Stir and bring just to a boil over medium heat. Spoon into      hot, clean jars. Seal and process in a boiling water bath,      5 minutes for half-pints and 10 minutes for pints. Makes 8      half-pints or 4 pints.    </p>   	<h3>Fiery Red Relish</h3>			<p>      Later in the season, when jalapeños turn red, try      the preceding recipe using red peppers and ripe red      tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      This relish is dazzling to look at and is as intensely hot      in flavor as it is flaming in color. Its preparation      differs only in the handling of the tomatoes. Since ripe      tomatoes contain more liquid than green ones, wash, core      and seed them to get rid of as much of the juice as you      can. Cut them into chunks, then place them in a colander      over a bowl and let drain for ½ hour. If you skip      this step, the relish will be too thin. After the tomatoes      have drained well, continue with the preceding recipe.    </p>    <p>      Because of the loss of liquid, the yield will not be the      same. One-and-a-half pounds of red jalapeños and 2      pounds of red tomatoes will make 3 pints or 6 half-pints of      scorching relish.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Minted Onions</strong><br />      4 cups white vinegar<br />      ¼ cup sugar<br />      2½ cups mint leaves<br />      Few drops green food coloring (optional)<br />      4 cups sliced peeled onions<br />      4 pimientos, thinly sliced (optional)    </p>    <p>      Tie mint up in cheesecloth. In a saucepan, mix vinegar,      sugar and mint; simmer the mixture for 10 minutes, then      remove from heat.    </p>    <p>      Add food coloring (if desired), onions and pimientos, and      bring to a boil. Remove mint. Pour into clean, hot jars and      process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes. Makes 2      pints or 4 half-pints.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Garden Salad</strong><br />      4 cups sliced cucumbers<br />      3 cups sliced green bell peppers<br />      3 cups sliced yellow squash<br />      2 cups sliced green tomatoes<br />      3 cups sliced onions<br />      2 cups sliced carrots<br />      2 cups sliced hot or mild banana peppers<br />      Salt<br />      ½ gallon vinegar<br />      5 or 6 cups sugar<br />      1 teaspoon turmeric    </p>    <p>      Mix the sliced vegetables and sprinkle them with salt.      Cover with ice and let stand for 2 or 3 hours.    </p>    <p>      In a large kettle, mix vinegar and sugar and bring to a      boil, then add turmeric. Remove vegetables from ice water,      shake off as much water as possible, and pack into clean,      hot jars. Process 5 minutes in a boiling water bath. Makes      about 10 pints.    </p>    <p>      Note: Other vegetables may be used in addition to, or in      place of, those listed above-cauliflower, zucchini,      just about anything that's around the house and garden at      pickling time.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Kathleen Davenport<br />      McCaysville, Georgia</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Curry Pickles</strong><br />      Cucumbers and onions to fill 4 or 5 pint jars, sliced      thin<br />      3 cups vinegar<br />      3 cups sugar<br />      1 tablespoon dry mustard<br />      1 tablespoon turmeric<br />      2 tablespoons hot curry powder<br />      1 tablespoon celery seed<br />      3 whole cloves<br />      5 slices ginger root<br />      ½ teaspoon Tabasco    </p>    <p>      Pack cucumbers and onions into jars. Combine vinegar, sugar      and spices and bring to a boil. Pour liquid over      vegetables, seal and process in a boiling water bath for 10      minutes. Makes 4-5 pints.    </p>
