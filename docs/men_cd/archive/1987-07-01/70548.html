           		<p><strong> KITCHEN GARDEN</strong></p>         <p>      Nothing else says "garden fresh" quite so sweetly.</p>      <h5 id="byline">By Sara Pacher</h5>       <p>      Corn ( <em>Zea mays</em> ) is more American than apple pie.      It's believed that an early type of this member of the      grass family was grown in South America at least 4,000      years ago, and it's known that corn was cultivated      throughout much of North America long before the time of      Christopher Columbus. He and his explorers are credited      with introducing corn to Europe, where it spread throughout      the continent and to Asia and Africa. Europeans still use      it primarily as a food for livestock. In the United States,      however-though 80% of our corn is fed to      animals-even growers with small gardens are likely to      plant this space-consuming vegetable, and for a very valid      reason: The sugar in most corn varieties starts changing to      starch as soon as it's picked, so ears that go straight      from the stalk to the pot or freezer offer a succulent      taste that corn purchased from a market, or even a roadside      stand, can never match.    </p>   <h3> What to Plant</h3>    <p>      There are literally hundreds of cultivated varieties of      corn, but they fall into four classes: popcorn ( <em>Z.      mays praecox</em> ), a low-calorie, nutritional snack;      dent, or field, corn (Z. m.indentata), used mostly for      animal feed but also popular in the South as a fried dish,      and the source of cornmeal; Indian, or flint, corn ( <em>Z      m. indurata</em> ), with colorful ears that are used for      ornamental purposes (the inner pan of the grain that      remains once the hull is removed is called hominy, which,      ground up, becomes grits); and sweet corn ( <em>Z. m.      rugosa</em> ), the popular choice for most home gardens.    </p>    <p>      Though sweet corn as we know it wasn't developed until just      over a century ago (and the now-popular hybrids began      appearing 30 years later), today's gardeners can choose      from early, midseason or late varieties that sport either      yellow or white kernels or a mixture of both. There are      also dwarf types as well as "skyscraper" varieties that      reach heights of 12 feet, and new offerings come on the      market every year.    </p>    <p>      Some popular early varieties of sweet corn, which take 58      to 70 days to mature, are Spring Gold (withstands cold and      damp soil and produces large ears), Seneca Explorer (also      popular in cold-weather areas), Silver Sweet (a white type      similar to the late-season Silver Queen but which matures      in 66 days), Butter Vee (ready in only 58 days with a high      sugar content) and Aztec (resists some strains of wilt and      tolerates smut). .    </p>    <p>      Midseason varieties, maturing about a week later than early      types, include the open-pollinated, low-starch Early Gold      Bantam, which retains its sweetness for a long time; Gold      Rush, a tender, sweet, yellow corn that adapts to most      climates; Mellow Yellow, which freezes well; Kandy Korn EH,      as sweet as its name and whose kernels can retain their      quality for up to two weeks on the stalk; Aristogold, which      grows well in dry conditions; Honey and Cream, a bicolor      with a tight husk that discourages earworms and other      insects and Platinum Lady, a delicious white variety.    </p>       <h3> Plan on a minimum of 10 to 15 plants per      person.</h3>    <p>      Of the late season types. Country Gentleman and Golden      Bantam-both open-pollinated-have been favorites      since they were developed many decades ago. Seneca Pinto,      Sugar Dots and Silver-N-Gold are all sweet, bicolored      cultivars, and the very late and very popular Silver Queen      is a white corn that takes 92 days to mature but is well      worth waiting for.    </p>    <p>      Among the dwarfs. Golden Midget (58 days) grows on stalks      only 2½' tall, and its 4" long ears freeze well;      Honey Cream, with 6" to 7" ears, is another good choice for      a small garden.    </p>    <p>      For popcorn, try White Cloud or Japanese Hulless. Both pop      big and have no hulls. Then there's the unique Indian      Ornamental Pop that's both tasty and decorative. Ornamental      corn, however, requires hot weather and a long growing      season. Indian Ornamental, for example, takes 110 days to      mature, producing large ears in an endless array of colors.      Field corn, called "roasting ears" by those southern      gardeners who relish them, has to be picked early before it      becomes too tough to eat. Hickory King, which comes in both      yellow and white versions, is a popular field variety.    </p>   <h3>When to Plant</h3>    <p>      Gardeners who are impatient for the first possible taste of      homegrown corn sometimes take the risk of planting two      weeks before the last frost date. Should you do this, be      prepared to risk losing your crop since corn is very      susceptible to frost. Other eager growers, particularly      those with short gardening seasons, start the seeds      indoors. Corn, however, doesn't transplant well, so it      should be started in peat pots in order to disturb the      roots as little as possible when moving it to the garden.      It's usually better to wait until all danger of frost is      past, and then, in order to have a long harvest, plant      early, midseason and later varieties at the same      time-or plant an early variety every two weeks for      six weeks or when the preceding crop is 3" tall. A      scarecrow might help keep birds from stealing the seeds      before they can sprout and from eating the small shoots.      Some people say a string stretched a few inches above the      row, especially if hung with foil pie pans, will also      discourage these thieves.    </p>    <h3>How to Plant</h3>    <p>      Plant corn in a sunny but wind-protected spot. While it      will grow in almost any soil, the vegetable does best in      well-worked, fertile soil with good drainage and a pH of      6.0 to 6.8. Because it's a heavy feeder, especially on      nitrogen, it's best to plant corn where beans were raised      the previous season or in an area where other legume crops,      such as alfalfa or clover, have been cultivated recently.      (Some Native Americans bury a fish under each hill of corn      to help provide needed nutrients.) Work in generous amounts      of compost or aged manure, along with bone meal and wood      ashes, to a depth of 6". If the soil is not very fertile,      you should probably side-dress the crop when it's about 6"      tall and again at about knee-height. Blood meal or a      diluted fish-based fertilizer are good for this purpose.    </p>    <p>      For best germination, the temperature of the earth should      be approximately 60°F. If the weather stays      unseasonably cool, you can hurry the warming process by      covering your future corn patch with black plastic.    </p>    <p>      Since a stalk of corn typically produces only two ears per      plant (except for some dwarf varieties, which have four),      plan on a minimum of 10 to 15 plants per person.<br />      Corn is wind-pollinated (each silk on the ears must receive      pollen from the tassels on top in order to produce a      kernel), so it generally does better planted in blocks      rather than rows. You can also put five seeds to a hill and      then thin to the three strongest plants.    </p>    <p>      Since corn has a 75% germination rate, plant the seeds 2"      deep, placing three kernels every 8" to 12", and thin the      stalks to 10" to 12" apart. (Dwarf varieties are generally      planted 1" deep and thinned to an 8" spacing.) Rows should      be 3' apart (2' for dwarfs). Use care when thinning plants      so as not to disturb the roots of those you keep. The seeds      should germinate in seven to ten days, and you'll need to      keep the weeds away, since this grasslike plant doesn't      compete well. Mulching with straw, leaves or grass      clippings can solve this problem and will also conserve      moisture. And corn <em>does</em> require a lot of water,      especially when the tops begin to tassel. (Don't wet down      flowering tops, though, since that could wash off the      pollen.) Stop weeding at tasseling time to avoid damaging      the surface roots.    </p>    <p>      As the plants grow, they will put out side shoots, or      "suckers." These don't harm production, however, and      cutting them off might damage the roots.    </p>    <p>      Since corn takes up a considerable amount of space in the      garden, it only makes sense to intersperse it with another      crop. With medium-size varieties, you might want to plant      half-runner beans. With tall varieties, pole beans can      twine up the stalks. Pumpkins and squash are other good      choices.    </p>    <h3>What to Watch For</h3>    <p>      Stewart's disease, a bacterial wilt that causes the plants      to become dwarfed and dried-up, can attack any type of      sweet corn but seems to favor yellow varieties. If you've      had this problem, choose a corn that's resistant to the      malady. Because the ailment is spread by flea beetles and      cucumber beetles, which thrive in plant refuse, keep your      garden clean and burn infected plants.    </p>    <p>      Corn smut looks worse than wilt, but it's usually less      damaging. It appears on the ear as a pale, shining, swollen      area that darkens and bursts, releasing powdery black      spores. It can be prevented with crop rotation and good      garden sanitation. Should it strike, cut off and dispose of      the galls before they open, and-if      necessary-destroy the infected ears or stalks to keep      smut from spreading to other plants. Once in the soil, it      can remain viable for five to seven years.    </p>    <p>      Corn earworms, which also attack tomato plants, can damage      the stalks but usually do the most harm to the ears      themselves, starting their mischief when the corn begins to      silk and continuing their destruction until harvest.      Earworms are striped, yellow-headed, about 2" long when      full-grown, and vary in color from yellow to green to      brown. You may first become aware of their moist castings      on the silks. Generally, they confine their damage to the      tips of the ears, which can be cut off when harvested.      Attack heavy infestations with <em>Bacillus      thuringiensis</em> , garlic/onion spray, rotenone or      pyrethrum, but be aware that such remedies are effective      only if applied as soon as you notice the castings and      before the worms have crawled too far inside the ear.      Another remedy is to put a few drops of mineral oil right      down into the top of each ear <em>after</em> the pollinated      silks have wilted and begun to turn brown. You can also use      this method to cope with 1/8"-long, black sap      beetles-which drill into ears.    </p>    <p>      European corn borers-1"-long, flesh-colored worms,      marked with fine black dots-overwinter as full-grown      larvae in the stems of weeds and cornstalks, pupating in      late spring. They emerge as yellowish-brown moths between      June and August and lay eggs on the undersides of the      plants' leaves. When hatched, the larvae bore into the      leaves, stalks and ears of corn. To break this cycle,      destroy all cornstalks and weeds in the fall. Lady-bugs,      <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> , rotenone and hand-picking      of the pests are often effective against a corn borer      infestation.    </p>    <p>      Cutworms can be discouraged by putting paper collars around      the young shoots. Flea beetles can be fought with hard hose      sprays, sticky traps, garlic sprays, garden-quality      diatomaceous earth or wood ashes. Seed-corn      maggots-yellowish-white, ¼"-long burrowers      with pointed heads-are most likely to trouble deeply      sown kernels in cool soil. If these maggots are a problem,      plant more corn at a shallower level in warmer weather.    </p>    <p>      To foil raccoons, paint a mixture of bacon grease and      cayenne pepper on the husks just before they mature. If      birds try to harvest the crop, protect the ears with paper      bags.    </p>    <h3>How to Harvest and Store</h3>    <p>      About three weeks after the corn silks appear, it's time to      start checking the ears for ripeness-and with this      crop, picking at the peak makes all the difference. When      the kernels are growing, the silks will be moist and green.      Once they turn dark but remain damp, it's time to harvest.      (An ear with a completely dry silk has been left on the      stalk too long.) The sheath should also be green and never      be allowed to turn yellow or a faded brown. The ultimate      ripeness test, however, is to pierce one of the kernels      with a thumbnail. If "milk" spurts out, you're going to      have a delightful dish. Ears on the same plant will ripen a      few days apart.    </p>    <p>      There's an old saying that "the pot should be boiling      before the corn is picked," so don't harvest your crop      until just before it's needed in the kitchen. Should there      be any delay between harvesting and eating or preserving,      leave the husks on, refrigerate the ears and use them in no      more than two days. (Some extra-sweet varieties actually      improve rather than deteriorate for the first few hours,      and these must never be grown near other types, as      cross-pollination will affect their flavor.) The exceptions      to this rule, of course, are the field and ornamental      varieties and popcorns, which should be left on the stalks      to dry until the first hard frost, or-in poor      weather-the stalks can be cut and stacked in a      sheltered, airy spot.    </p>    <p>      Corn contains vitamins A and B and a number of minerals,      and to get its full nutritional value, it should really be      eaten raw. With many of the very sweet varieties, that may      be the best way to savor it, but don't overdo, because raw      corn is a laxative.    </p>    <p>      To prepare corn on the cob, put the husked ears in rapidly      boiling water, cover tightly and cook for five minutes or      until it's barely tender. Be careful not to overcook.<br />      To roast corn, put the ears, with the husks still intact,      on the middle rack of a 300°F oven and cook for 30      minutes. Then strip off the husks, brush the ears with      butter, sprinkle them with salt and serve immediately.    </p>    <p>      It takes a bushel of ears to yield only a few quarts of      kernels, but come next winter you'll be delighted with      yourself if you take the trouble now to preserve some of      your crop. To freeze corn whole, husk the ears, clean off      the silks, wash the ears thoroughly, then blanch them for      six to eight minutes. Cool the ears, wrap them in foil or      plastic and freeze them. Follow the same procedure to      freeze kernels, cutting them off with a sharp knife (for      creamed corn, cut only halfway through the kernels and      press out the extra milk), before packing and storing them.    </p>    <p>      When canning kernels, use only pint jars. Corn is so low in      acid that authorities don't recommend canning it in quarts.      After cleaning and cutting (but not blanching) the corn,      process it in sterile jars at 10 pounds of pressure for 55      minutes.    </p>  <h3> Don't pick your corn till the pot boils.</h3>   <h3>Corn Relish</h3>    <p>      2 quarts whole kernel corn, fresh (16-20 medium ears) or      frozen (6 10-ounce packages)<br />      5 sweet red peppers, diced<br />      5 green peppers, diced<br />      1 bunch celery, chopped<br />      1½ cups chopped onions<br />      1½ cups sugar<br />      1 quart white vinegar<br />      2 tablespoons salt<br />      2 teaspoons celery seed<br />      2 tablespoons dry mustard 1 teaspoon turmeric    </p>    <p>      Defrost frozen corn if used. Mix peppers, celery, onions,      sugar, vinegar, salt and celery seed in 6-8-quart      nonaluminum pan. Boil uncovered for 5 minutes, stirring      occasionally. Combine mustard and turmeric and blend with      some liquid from boiling mixture; add, with corn, to      boiling mixture. Return to boiling and cook 5 minutes,      stirring occasionally. Pack into pint jars, seal and      process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. Makes 7      pints.    </p>    <p>      Note: If desired, relish may be thickened by blending      ¼ cup flour with ½ cup water and adding the      mixture with the corn; stir frequently.<br />    </p>
