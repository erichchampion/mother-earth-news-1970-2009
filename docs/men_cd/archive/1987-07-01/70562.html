                    <p>      <em>How to get along with your flying neighbors.</em><br />    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Terry Krautwurst</h5>        <p>      <strong>Friendly or fierce? Bad or beneficial? When it      comes to these summertime residents, both fear and beauty      are in the eye of the beholder.</strong>    </p>    <p>      My earliest memories include the time my big brother pushed      me out of the hayloft onto a cement floor, the summer      morning I toddled off a pier and nearly drowned, and The      Day The Wasp Stung Me. I can still recall my      terror-overwhelming as only a small child's can      be-when the wasp landed on the inside of my shirt      collar. Maybe three years old at the most, I took off      running pell-mell across the barnyard toward our house,      screaming, flailing at the insect. Naturally it stung me. I      swatted some more, and it stung me again. By the time my      father reached me and brushed the wasp away, my neck and      shoulder were dotted with a half-dozen painful red      swellings. Luckily, I've never been sensitive to wasp      venom, and after a few days of soreness and itching the      bites faded away.    </p>    <p>      Not so the memory. Just as the hayloft incident taught me      to think twice before turning my back on my big brother,      and falling off the pier gave me a lesson in the difference      between bath water and deep water, the wasp stings left a      lasting impression. It was a good thing, too, because when      you're a boy growing up on a dairy farm, keeping your      distance from wasps and hornets is almost as essential as      keeping your feet out of cow pies. But I was more than just      wary of wasps. I spent most of my young life in compulsive      fear of them-and of nearly any insect that looked or      even <em>sounded</em> like a wasp. I was convinced that      their sole purpose was to attack and sting people (me in      particular).    </p>    <p>      It was only years later, when my interests in nature and      the outdoors forced me to come to grips with my fear, that      I learned otherwise. Wasps are among the most maligned of      all living creatures. They play extraordinary, fascinating      roles in nature. As a group, they're the single most      effective natural control of earth's agricultural and      household insect pests. And though it's true that more      people die each year from wasp and bee stings than from the      bites of all other venomous creatures, it's also true that      wasps and bees are far more mild-mannered than commonly      believed, and seldom sting without cause.    </p>    <p>      For that matter, of the 2,500 or so species of wasps known      to inhabit North America, only about 50 can sting at all.      What we call a stinger is actually a modified ovipositor,      the hollow tube through which female insects deposit eggs.      Most wasps use the instrument for that purpose alone. Some      species employ the tube to bore holes into tree bark or      other vegetable matter in which to lay eggs. Others, such      as trichogrammas, the gardeners' allies against cabbage      loopers and corn borers, inject eggs into the bodies or      larvae of other insects. Only a relative handful of wasps      are also capable of injecting venom through their      ovipositors, and thus a painful sting. But even of these,      virtually all are mild-mannered loners, solitary wasps that      ordinarily keep their distance from man and use their      venom-loaded hypodermics only to stun spiders, caterpillars      or other insects with which to provision their nests.      Except when mating, they live their lives alone.    </p>        <h3>      Mud Daubers    </h3>    <p>      Probably the most familiar of solitary wasps are the mud      daubers, which (OK, it's obvious) build their homes with      mud. Chances are you've seen the lumpy, dried-mud nests of      the black-and-yellow mud dauber (scientifically and      appropriately named <em>Sceliphron caementarium</em> ) or      the tidier, parallel-tube architecture of the organ pipe      wasp ( <em>Trypoxylon politum</em> ). Both species gather      mud from the banks of puddles and pools by rolling the clay      into pea-size pellets and flying it, one pellet at a time,      to a suitable homesite-usually a house or barn wall,      a rafter or the eave of a roof. There, spreading mud in      overlapping semicircles and buzzing heartily as she works      (only females build nests), the wasp plasters together a      hollow, tubular cell. As soon as she completes a cell she      flies off in search of a spider, paralyzes it with a sting      (wasps <em>never</em> use their stingers to kill prey      except in self-defense), then grasps it between her jaws      and forelegs and flies home. The mud dauber then shoves the      stunned insect (or sometimes several of them) into the      cell, lays a single egg in the compartment, closes it off      and proceeds to build and stock other cells beside or on      top of the first. Most dauber nests contain from six to 20      cells, although much larger nests have been recorded.    </p>    <p>      Once all the cells have been stocked and an egg laid in      each, the wasp covers the nest with an outer layer of clay      and leaves for good. Soon white, grublike larvae hatch from      the eggs and feast on the paralyzed spiders. A few days      later, the well-fed larvae spin cocoons in which they      pupate, or develop into adult insects. The transformation      takes about three weeks, after which each mature wasp chews      a small hole in the wall of its cell and flies away to      mate. All wasps go through this four-stage      process-egg, larva, pupa and adult. As you may      remember from biology class (or from <em>Invasion of the      Body Snatchers</em> ), this is called <em>complete      metamorphosis</em> .    </p>    <p>      The mud dauber's tendency to build nests on manmade      structures and its peculiar habit of buzzing loudly as it      works are unfortunate. For those reasons alone, countless      nests end up crushed under the butt end of a broomstick or      soaked in insecticide. Too bad, because mud daubers are      among the meekest of wasps-you virtually have to pick      one up and squeeze it to make it sting-and are      effective predators of household spiders. One species, in      fact-the blue mud dauber ( <em>Chal-byion      califomicum</em> )- specializes in capturing black      widow spiders. (This dauber is also known as the blue      burglar for its habit of breaking into other dauber nests,      tossing out all the larvae and spiders.) Other types of      daubers prey on cabbage loopers and other garden pests. In      short, mud daubers are good wasps to have around.    </p>    <h3>      Paper Wasps    </h3>    <p>      The creatures most of us think of when we think "wasp" are      the social, or paper, wasps: the hornets, yellow jackets      and other species that build oval, papery nests in which      hundreds or even thousands of individual insects live and      work cooperatively, much like bees in a hive.    </p>    <p>      If you're ever at a gathering of entomologists and the      party gets dull, ask someone in a loud voice what the      differences are between hornets and yellow jackets (species      of the genus <em>Vespula</em> ). Confusion reigns over the      distinctions between members of the two groups-to the      point where the names are used interchangeably. For the      sake of discussion, some naturalists have settled on the      essentially arbitrary distinction that yellow jackets build      their nests underground or concealed in walls, while      hornets (which some scientists assign to a more specialized      genus, <em>Dolichovespula</em> ) build pear-shaped, aerial      nests suspended above ground. It's as good a compromise as      any, though in actual fact the wasps seem not to have the      distinction down either, and sometimes build in the "wrong"      place. Still, the general rule is hornets above, yellow      jackets beneath.    </p>    <p>      The most common hornets in North America are the bald-faced      hornet ( <em>Vespula maculata</em> ) and the sandhill      hornet ( <em>Vespula arenaria</em> ). <em>Maculata</em> is      a large (one to one-and-a-half inches long), black species      with a distinctive white pattern on its face and body.      <em>Arenaria</em> is somewhat smaller (about an inch long)      and less widely distributed, and has yellow and black      stripes (it's often called a yellow jacket). Both types      generally build their characteristic globular paper nests      in the open, in bushes, trees and on buildings. The      bald-faced hornet's nest can become the size of a bushel      basket, and the sandhill's may reach the proportions of a      soccer ball. The larger the nest, the more aggressively      they defend it (this is true of all paper wasps).    </p>    <p>      Separate yellow jacket species are almost impossible to      identify by appearance-they're all about one-half to      one inch long, and are yellow-and-black striped-but      their nesting habits are distinct. The eastern yellow      jacket ( <em>Vespula maculifrons</em> ) and the western      yellow jacket ( <em>V. pennsylvanica</em> ) build nests in      the ground, often in the abandoned burrows of moles or      other animals, or at ground level in brush piles or hollow      logs.    </p>    <p>      Although you can't see them, the nests are much like hornet      nests, consisting of several horizontal tiers of      honeycomblike cells all enclosed in a paper sheath. The      entrance hole to such a nest may be no larger than a      quarter, but the nest itself can be as big as, or bigger      than, a bald-faced hornet's. Another yellow jacket species,      <em>Vespula germanica</em> , builds equally large nests      inside the walls of buildings.    </p>    <p>      Generally speaking, yellow jackets have nastier tempers      than other paper wasps, but they are not the maddened      winged terrorists so many people make them out to be, and      seldom sting, as is often heard, "at the least      provocation." The real trouble with yellow jackets is that      you can't see the nest until you've blundered across it,      either stepping on the entrance or running over it with a      tractor or lawn mower. Wall-nesting <em>germanica</em>      yellow jackets are similarly hazardous, because they tend      to chew away the plasterboard and insulation in a wall      until only a paper-thin barrier remains between the nest      and the inside of the building. Pity the unsuspecting      homeowner who, upon hearing a buzzing and scraping inside a      wall, knocks on the surface to locate the source-only      to put his fist into a mass of yellow jackets.    </p>    <p>      The third major group of common paper wasps encompasses a      number of similar-looking species all belonging to the      genus <em>Polistes</em> . Depending on where you live,      these slender, hard-bodied wasps may be brown, rust-colored      or black, or they may have yellow or black stripes. They      build relatively simple nests consisting of a single,      unenclosed comb suspended from a short stem. Because their      nests have no roof or walls, <em>Polistes</em> wasps build      their homes where they'll be out of the rain-under      shed roofs, inside double-hung windows, beneath eaves.      <em>Polistes</em> wasps are the gentlest of paper wasps and      seldom attack unless provoked. They <em>can</em> inflict a      painful sting, though-it was a <em>Polistes</em> that      injected the fear of wasps into my toddler-size neck many      years ago.    </p>    <h3>      The Life Cycle    </h3>    <p>      Though each type has its idiosyncrasies, yellow jackets,      hornets and Polistes wasps have similar life histories.      Except in tropical regions, paper wasp communities are      single-season affairs. Each is begun in spring by a female      that, the previous fall, mated with one or more males and      then spent the winter hibernating in a protected      place-often beneath the bark of a tree or log, or      between boards in an attic or basement. When the queen      emerges from hibernation in the spring, she dines on flower      nectar to restore her strength, then selects a nesting site      and begins to build. She collects fibers from old boards,      branches, fence posts and other sources, pulling up the      pieces with her jaws and chewing and mixing them with      saliva to form a small pellet of      papier-mâchê-like pulp. Then she flies back to      the nest site, where she spreads the pellet out to form a      paper-thin layer. Shuttling back and forth, gathering      material and returning to apply it, she builds the      foundation and a few shallow cells.    </p>    <p>      The queen lays an egg in each cell, and as she lays each      egg, she also releases a sperm cell from the supply that      she's carrier in her body since she mated the previous      fall. A few days later, the fertilized eggs hatch and the      queen feeds the larvae bits of chewed-up insects. She      continues providing the grubs with a bug burger diet for      the next week to three weeks-after which the larvae      spin cocoons and transform into pupae. A week to three      weeks later, they emerge as adults.    </p>    <p>      The first brood of the season, and most of the subsequent      broods, are sterile females, workers who take over nest      building and all other duties except egg laying, which      becomes the queen's only job. In her single-season      lifetime, a queen hornet or yellow jacket may lay as many      as 25,000 eggs.    </p>    <p>      By July and August, paper wasp nests are . . . well, a      beehive of activity. The population of a hornet or yellow      jacket nest may number in the thousands. (      <em>Polistes</em> colonies seldom exceed several hundred.)      Workers busily shuttle back and forth, some delivering      chewed-up prey to larvae while others work to expand the      nest. On hot days, some workers fan the nest with their      wings, and sometimes even carry water from puddles and      pools and sprinkle it on the cell walls to keep the colony      cool. At its peak, a mature colony of paper wasps, with      hundreds or thousands of individuals working together,      driven to cooperation by eons of evolved instinct, seems      like one solitary creature-a pulsating paper organism      with a single purpose and a hundred thousand legs.    </p>    <h3>      Pioneers hung wasp nests to control houseflies.    </h3>    <p>      But by late summer, for reasons not entirely understood,      the society begins to deteriorate. More and more pupae      emerge as males or fertile females rather than as sterile      female workers. The reproductive wasps take little part in      caring for the colony, and gradually the remaining workers      lose interest in the larvae and abandon them, or sometimes      even feed on them. The queen, exhausted, dies. Eventually,      all the males and fertile females leave the nest to mate.      The workers remain but, left with little strength, perish      one by one. The males, too, die after mating. In the end,      only the reproductive females, each already carrying the      live sperm that will produce next season's colonies,      survive to hibernate and perpetuate the cycle.    </p>    <p>      Wasps, it seems, like so many other creatures branded      "dangerous" by man, are only struggling to survive,      following the tyranny of their genes, no more bad than      beneficial, no more harmful than harmless.    </p>    <h3>      STING FIRST AID    </h3>    <p>      If, despite all your precautions, you do get stung by a      wasp or bee, treat the bite immediately. A bee leaves its      stinger and attached venom sac behind. This is not true of      wasps, but sometimes a part of a wasp stinger will break      off and remain. In either case, gently flick the stinger up      and out with your fingernail, a pocket knife blade or      tweezers. If a venom sac is attached, don't squeeze it.    </p>    <p>      Wash the area around the sting with soap and water, and      apply ice or a cold towel. Calamine lotion, or a paste made      of water and either baking soda, meat tenderizer or-      if nothing else is available-mud will help soothe the      sting and prevent swelling. An oral antihistamine (Benadryl      is one brand) also can reduce itching. Aspirin or      acetaminophen can ease the pain. Elevate and rest the      affected area for an hour or more.    </p>    <p>      Normal reactions to an insect sting occur within four hours      and include soreness and itching, localized swelling and a      general redness around the sting. Many people, however, are      mildly to severely allergic to insect venom. Moderate      allergy symptoms include generalized hives, wheezing,      stomach pain, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Severe      allergic reactions include any of the preceding, plus      difficulty in swallowing, hoarseness or thickened speech,      weakness, confusion-and in extreme cases, shock, drop      in blood pressure, collapse and unconsciousness.    </p>    <p>      Most deaths from stings are caused by extreme allergic      reactions. But even a moderate allergic reaction is cause      to see a doctor as soon as possible. You may be becoming      more sensitive with each sting, and treatment by an      allergist may be required.    </p>    <h3>      Wasps and You    </h3>    <p>      When you learn the life cycle, habits and likely habitats      of wasps and combine that knowledge with common sense and      reasonable caution, you have a pretty good formula for      safety.    </p>    <p>      For example, since bald-faced and sandhill      hornets-and sometimes yellow jackets-build      their nests in brush or tall grass, it makes good sense to      stay away from such areas as much as possible during the      summer and early fall. Be especially careful, too, when      clearing overgrowth or working around logs or downed      trees-also likely nesting sites. When you're mowing      your lawn, keep an eye out for the telltale activity of      yellow jackets flying in and out of an entrance hole.    </p>    <p>      If you must be in an area that is likely wasp habitat,      avoid wearing bright-colored clothing, and don't use      strong-scented cosmetics. Both are believed to attract      insects, including wasps. Also, some entomologists claim      that wasps are especially active and aggressive on hot,      humid days. While this may or may not be true, it's a good      idea to do garden and yard work in the morning or early      evening, when temperatures-and perhaps wasp      tempers-are cooler.    </p>         <p>      There's considerable evidence to suggest that paper wasps      that establish nests near humans-say, over a      doorway-become accustomed to the activity and carry      on their lives without attacking. (In fact, according to      some reports, pioneers in the Midwest used to hang      bald-faced hornet nests in their homes as a way to control      houseflies!) Nonetheless, the closer such nests are to your      home, the greater the potential for      trouble-particularly if you have any curious children      in your family. Probably the best time to think about wasp      control around your home is early spring, when queens are      just emerging from hibernation. Weak and relatively      slow-moving at first, these females can sometimes be      discouraged from establishing nests too close for      comfort-say, near a children's play area. Try      knocking the foundation cells down with a long pole; the      queen may decide to set up housekeeping elsewhere. If she      persists in selecting that site for her nest, you may need      to make the queen your target-use a stick or fly      swatter-before she has a chance to lay eggs and      nurture the larvae. Killing a single queen is a lot easier      and less hazardous than coping with an established colony.      (This may indirectly account for the old English      superstition that if you kill the first wasp you see each      year, you'll have good luck and win over your enemies.)    </p>    <p>      Once a nest has been established, your options become      fewer. Knocking the structure down is seldom      effective-more often than not, the wasps will simply      begin anew at the same site and (worse yet) are likely to      behave more aggressively than ever. Old-fashioned sticky      flypaper, still available in most hardware stores,      sometimes proves a fatal attraction to <em>Polistes</em>      workers; just hang the strips from eaves or branches near      the offending comb.    </p>    <p>      A yellow jacket nest concealed in a wall of your home      presents a somewhat more difficult problem. Chances are      you'll need to call in a professional exterminator.      Meanwhile, to prevent the problem from recurring, caulk any      cracks around windows and doors-the most likely      points of entry for yellow jackets.    </p>    <p>      Underground yellow jacket nests can sometimes be wiped out      by placing a clear glass bowl firmly in the ground over the      entrance hole. (Keep in mind that there may be more than      one entrance, in which case you'll need to cover them all.)      The wasps won't dig additional exit holes, and in a few      days will starve to death. A somewhat more aggressive      method, but still preferable to using insecticides, is to      pour fuel oil into the entrance hole.    </p>    <p>      In any event, these and other techniques for exterminating      a nest-including spraying-should be attempted      only at night, when all the wasps are inside the nest and      relatively inactive. All paper wasps are vision fliers, and      cannot navigate in the dark. Your chances of getting all      the insects in a colony are much greater, and the odds of      your getting stung much less, when you do the job at night.    </p>    <p>      Finally, learn to recognize the warning signals most wasps      give off when they feel you're too close. A      <em>Polistes</em> wasp on the nest will lift its wings,      raise its front legs and rear up on its back legs. A hornet      or yellow jacket (or, more rarely, a <em>Polistes</em> )      may warn you away from the nest by flying straight at you      fast. Normally, wasps fly in a somewhat slow, meandering      fashion as they forage; if a wasp comes toward you in this      manner, it means no harm and will likely fly past you. If      it gets too close, don't swat at it: A slow movement or      gentle wave will send it on its way. Running from a wasp is      pretty much futile, since a paper wasp's normal cruising      speed is about 13 mph, and its pursuit speed is      considerably faster. Likewise, don't panic if a wasp      accidentally lands on you; it'll probably leave on its own      momentarily, or you can make a slight shrugging movement to      encourage it into flight.    </p>    <p>      That's all easier said than done, of course. Cool      objectivity is fine when you're looking at a wasp from a      scientific, arm's-length point of view-but when      you're looking at a wasp <em>on</em> your arm. . . well      now. Me, I still go into head-to-toe adrenaline overdrive      whenever a wasp or bee buzzes too close. My stomach still      leaps to my throat, my heart still pounds like a punching      bag. Out of sheer, stubborn pride, I <em>usually</em>      -usually-manage to stand my ground. But      mentally I run like a rabbit.    </p>    <p>      There's something about man's fear of wasps that goes      deeper than reason. Maybe it's just the natural order of      things. Maybe, in addition to all the other roles the wasp      plays in nature, there's another: to keep us humans      humble.<br />    </p>
