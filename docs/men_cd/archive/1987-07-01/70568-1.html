        THE FARMER'S FRIEND The Suffolk is the only draft horse bred for farm work. 1. It has a docile temperant and agreat willingness to work. 2. The short back and legs give the horse a good build for pulling. 3. Shoulders are upright?positioned for power, not speed. 4. Forearm and thigh muscles are especially long and strong. 5. An efficient keeper, it does more work on less feed. 6. The smooth coat on the legs doesn't collect dirt and mud.
