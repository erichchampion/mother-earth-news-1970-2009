                <p>      <em>To shed some light on the hen fruit fertility question      . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Ray Meloy</h5>        <p>      "Don't count your chickens before they hatch" is one      proverb this poultry raiser has learned to take literally.      I know from experience just how frustrating it is to have a      hen (or an incubator) waste time trying to hatch an      unfertilized egg. However, since I put together my homemade      candler-a device that allows me to see <em>inside      unhatched</em> egg snot only can I glean the chicks-to-be      from the mere omelet fixings, I can also check the      freshness and purity of those infertile, "eating-grade" hen      fruits. Best of all, my tester was fashioned from a few      inexpensive parts and took only minutes to make!<br />      <br />      <strong>CANDLER CONSTRUCTION</strong><br />      <br />      The main component of my little lantern is a good-sized      metal can with a lid (mine happens to be a candy container,      but a coffee can or any canister with a tight fitting lid      would serve just as well). To make the candler, I first      positioned an ordinary light fixture inside the can . . .      punching a few mounting holes in the container's bottom . .      . and then securing the fixture in place with a couple of      small nuts and bolts. I made one other opening in the      bottom of the canister for the light's electric cord.<br />      <br />      On the free end of this wire, I attached an electric plug,      and then (for convenience's sake) I added an in-line switch      to the cord. To make a "porthole" for illuminating the      eggs, I cut a 1-1/2"-diameter hole in the container's lid.      A 2-1/4"-diameter cork gasket glued around that opening      prevents any egg from cracking, should it accidentally bump      the can while being examined. (If you have a hard time      finding such a part, cut your own from gasket material,      felt, or rubber.)<br />      <br />      I added four legs to the side of my candler to allow for      horizontal viewing. These supports were easily made by      cutting two 6"-long strips from thin sheet metal and then      bending each strip to form a pair of legs, which I secured      to the can's side with sheet metal screws (you could use      pop rivets instead). I also punched a few holes in the      container's sides for ventilation before adding a quick      coat of high temperature auto engine paint to produce a      really snazzy looking finish. Once that had dried, I      screwed in a 40-watt light bulb, plugged the contraption      in, and darkened the room. With that, I was ready to start      candling my eggs!<br />      <br />      <strong>GLOWING REPORTS</strong><br />      <br />      I've found it best to test the fertility of white eggs      around the fourth day after they've been laid. Dark ones,      on the other hand, give the most accurate results after      about a week. Any dirt on the shells should be gently      brushed-not <em>washed</em> away. To check for signs of      fertility, carefully place an egg's wide end to the candler      opening so that the entire oval is illuminated. In a      fertile, hatchable egg there will be a fine network of      veins running out from a dark center. "Clears" (those with      no visible embryonic development) are ones that never were      fertilized, while the few with small blood spots could be      either fertilized eggs in which the embryo has died or      unfathered fruits that have simply had some veins      rupture.<br />      <br />      Incidentally, you can candle not only to pick out the      potential chicks, but also to check the quality of eggs      going to market or into the kitchen. Here again, the oval      is held with its broad end to the light opening, but in      this case, it's given a few quick turns so that the      contents rotate within the shell (to promote fuller      viewing). A fresh egg will have an air space 1/8" (or less)      in depth and a yolk that's free of foreign particles, blood      rings, large spots, and other defects. (You probably won't      want to sell the eggs with blood spots . . . but if you      merely remove the specks with the tip of a knife, they'll      do just fine for your own table.)<br />      <br />      Well, that's that. My candler, I'll admit, is a fairly      simple gadget. But, for the few minutes it took to build,      it's sure saved me (and my hens) a whole lot of time!    </p>
