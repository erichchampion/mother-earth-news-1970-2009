                    <p>      <em>MOTHER's "bright idea" crew</em> Outs a <em>new</em>      twist <em>on an old chore with these . . .</em></p>        <p>      As the days grow shorter, it's a sure bet that folks will      be relying more upon household lighting to extend their      productive hours. However, as convenient as electric bulbs      are, they <em>do</em> burn out . . . and replacing them      especially those set in a hard-to-reach location can be a      troublesome (and sometimes even dangerous) chore.<br />      <br />      So, to make shaky stepladders and teetering chairs a thing      of the past, our research staffers devised the two      incandescent bulb changers you see here. The first will      handle conventional indoor globes typical of those you      might find in hallway ceilings, garages, and attics. It's      little more than a 3' (more or less) length of 3/4" CPVC      pipe forced into the neck of a half-liter plastic soda pop      bottle. Since the outside diameter o f the pipe is about      7/8" (and thus is slightly larger than the opening in the      bottle), one end of the plastic staff must be sanded to a      taper so the joining parts are compatible. The bulb basket      can then be formed by cutting of the container's base (be      sure to leave about 3/8" of contour around the edge so the      tool can grip the bulb), and stuffing the inside of the      bottle with wads of foam upholstery padding.<br />      <br />      Using the tool is just a matter of popping the basket over      the expired bulb and pulling gently on the handle while      turning it to unscrew the lamp from its socket. After the      old globe is discarded, a new one can be pressed into the      basket and threaded into place.    </p>        <p>      The second changer was designed for use on indoor and      outdoor spotlights. Because those bulbs have somewhat flat      faces, you can employ a suction cup, rather than a basket,      to grip the glass. To make this "grabber", first locate a      3"-diameter rubber "foot" from a car top carrier (it must      have a 1/4" socket-not a stem-for mounting, and should be      available as a replacement part in auto accessory stores),      and then run a 1/4" drill bit in the cup's socket and      through its core to penetrate the "sucker".<br />      <br />      Now, find yourself about 15 feet of 1/4" plastic tubing and      a straight nylon connector to fit that hose, and scrounge      up an 8' length of 3/4" Schedule 40 PVC pipe to serve as a      handle . Depending on the design of your suction cup, it'll      either fit snugly inside the pipe <em>or</em> force you to      make two perpendicular cuts across the pipe's diameter and      jam the four "fingers" over the cup's mount to hold it      securely.    </p>        <p>      In any case, before you fasten the suction tip in place,      install the connector to the end of the hose and then press      it into the socket in back of the cup. With this done, you      can feed the free end of the hose through the length of PVC      pipe and let it extend out the open end.<br />      <br />      Once the suction cup is installed, changing a spotlight      takes just a few seconds. You must first place the rubber      cup against the bulb's face, then establish a grip by      sucking slightly on the tube as if it were a straw.      Maintaining the vacuum (either by folding and pinching the      tube or by using the clip from a hot water bottle), turn      the tool's han dle to remove the bulb. (Replacing the      light, of course, is simply a matter of reversing the      procedure.)<br />      <br />      These homemade work savers are indeed changes for the      better (especially considering their nonconductive handles)      . . . and, after using them, we think you'll wonder why you      ever even <em>considered</em> climbing a stepladder.    </p>
