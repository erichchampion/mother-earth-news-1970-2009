                    <p>      Add rustic splendor to your home year round!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Marie Wilson    </h5>    <p>      Every year, my husband and I enjoy making wreaths of      grapevines gathered from our own backyard arbor . . . to      give as gifts, to sell, or just to keep for ourselves.      These unique hang anywhere garlands are a cinch to create      and can be either left in their natural state or spruced up      with ribbon and dried flowers to suit almost any occasion.      (I recently finished a small one, garnished with an ivory      tinted bow and baby's breath, to give to a friend in      celebration of the birth of her first child.) Furthermore,      the woven rings are always a big hit at our church's annual      Thanksgiving craft fair. In fact, we usually can make      enough money from marketing them to cover most of our own      holiday expenses. And the ones we don't sell make wonderful      Christmas gifts!<br />      <br />      Since grapes grow Larne or wild backyards and thickets all      across the U.S., there's probably a hefty supply of the raw      materials practically at your doorstep, or at least within      driving distance. So if you'd like to try your hand at      twisting profits and presents out of those spindly cords,      here are a few pointers to get you started.    </p>        <p>      <strong>GATHERING GOODS FOR GARLANDS</strong><br />      <br />      The main ingredient of a wreath is, of course, the vine      itself, and the best time to forage for grapevines is      during their dormant season . . . which in most places      falls between September and April. And, if you don't have      an arbor or access to a vine-draped woods, a friend or      neighbor who grows grapes would doubtless be glad to      exchange some vines for a little pruning assistance.<br />      <br />      Once you've located a harvestable crop of vines, collecting      them is a snap! Just use a sharp pair of shears to cut      them, and then pull them free. If any dried leaves or fruit      are still on the branches, try to remove them as you snatch      the canes out . . .being careful to leave as many of the      delicately curling tendrils as possible, since it's these      tiny "locklets"that'll give your wreath its      distinction.<br />      <br />      Instead of trying to transport the sprawling mass home, a      lot of folks turn the vines into wreaths right where they      collect them. However, if you'd rather work in the comfort      of your own yard, lay the vines on the ground in manageable      bunches as you collect them. Then, when you're through      pruning, loosely wrap each bundle-one at a time-around your      forearm from your hand to your elbow . . .and tie the      pieces together into a portable circle with twine, string,      or light wire. This may your harvest lot 22S,, to grow, and      haul.<br />      <br />      Other than the vines, the only materials you're likely to      need for wreath making are odds and ends of ribbons (the      silk, rayon, or other fabric types are the most pliable and      attractive) . . .dried flowers . . . ornamental birds . .      .and anything else that you think will make your creations      beguiling.<br />      <br />      <strong>WREATHERY</strong><br />      <br />      Plan to make your garlands as soon as possible after the      vines have been gathered . . . before the canes dry out and      become hard to work with. If you can't get to the task      right away and the canes do get a little brittle, try      soaking them in water for a few hours to restore their      flexibility.<br />      <br />      To begin wreath making, start with a fairly long, stout      strand. Then, holding the thicker end in one hand, loop the      rest of the vine around in a circle as if you were winding      up a garden hose. Make this first ring about the size you      wish your finished product to be (ours average      approximately 30 inches across).<br />      <br />      Next, loop the vine around until you're about midway      through a <em>second</em> circle and pull the strand      through to the inside of the ring to anchor the wreath      together. (Don't think you're hopelessly inept if it takes      you several tries to get the circle to hold: This step is      tricky for anyone.) When your ring is secured -you may      still have to keep it in place with one hand while you      continue to work-wrap the vine around the outside and then      pull it back through to the inside of the circle in a      spiral . . . as if you were wrapping a stiff ribbon around      in candy-cane fashion.<br />      <br />      Continue spiraling this way until you come to the end of      the vine. Now, firmly tuck the <em>loose end into</em> the      ody of the wreath Grapevines are stiff enough chat-if you      do this right-you shouldn't have to hold the circle      together with an unattractive tie of string or wire.<br />      <br />      One cane may be all you need to complete your garland, but      if you wish to add another, simply tuck a second strand in      near the first, and coil it in the same candy-cane style      around the wreath . . . then fasten it in as you did the      other.<br />      <br />      When you're satisfied with your wreath's thickness,      embellish it with appropriate decorations to give it a      seasonal-or "occasional"flair. We leave many of our wreaths      as they are, though, because we feel that a ribbon or even      a touch of color would detract from their natural, rustic      charm.<br />      <br />      <strong>A WREATH FOR ALL SEASONS</strong><br />      <br />      Once you get the hang of it, you'll find that making      grapevine wreaths is no more difficult than winding up your      garden hose. It's a lot more <em>fun,</em> though! So go on      . . . give it a try. In almost no time, you'll proudly be      creating hang-anywhere decorations that can celebrate      whatever occasion!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Similar wreaths</em> <em>run ha</em>      <em>made from kudzu, bittersweet, wisteria,</em> <em>at      hon</em> <em>eysuckle vines. While you're out foraging, you      might get some</em> of <em>them to experiment</em> <em>with      . . .</em> <em>but take care not to gather poison ivy!</em>    </p>

Start your wreath by looping the vines in a circle. [2] The finished garland can be sold, given as a special remembrance, or kept for your own home. [3] The more wreaths you make, the easier you'll find them to create. [4] You can adorn your vines with colorful ribbons and bows (or anything else that strikes your fancy!).
