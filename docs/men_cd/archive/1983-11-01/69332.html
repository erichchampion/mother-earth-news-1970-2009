                    <p>      <em>What's up on the road ahead? It's not</em> a <em>bird,      it's not a plane, it's one more example of . . .</em></p>			<h5 id="byline">by Grover Brink man</h5>			<p>      Perhaps you've given it little thought, but innumerable      roadside mailboxes in rural America stand as commendable      testimonies of <em>very creative</em> recycling! Why, just      look at the pictures here, and you'll see how easy it is      for items once deemed "useless junk" to be turned into      examples of expressive individualism by (no doubt)      ecologically minded citizens!<br />      <br />      If you'd like to join the swelling throng of this      waste-reducing movement, just keel in mind these few rules.      First off, your "eco-box" should sit 3-1/2 to 4 feet from      the ground. Legally speaking, the letter holder itself has      to be "government ap- ; proved" for sturdiness, water      tightness, etc. (in other words, you're supposed to buy not      make-one). But you can build <em>around I</em> that      certified container just about any kind of support      structure you please . . . provided that your mail carrier      can get to the box without having to reach far enough to      aggravate his or her bursitis.</p>            <p>      And that, fellow postal patron, is all there is to it. So      remember, you, too, can do your part to preserve our      environment (or, at least, its man-made leftovers). All you      have ` to do is let yourself get stricken with . . .      mailbox mania!    </p>
