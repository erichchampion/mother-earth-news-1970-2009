                <p>      <em>You may puzzle your way into a nice little sideline      moneymaker if you learn to . . .</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Lynn E. Kauffman</h5>		<p>      You don't have to be a professional writer to make good      money with words . . . and if you doubt me, spend a few      minutes at your local newsstand looking through any of the      <em>numerous</em> word-search puzzle magazines now being      published. Virtually all of the games in those specialized      periodicals-as well as the similar puzzles featured      regularly in mainstream consumer and trade magazines-are      produced by people who have simply exercised a little      imagination and tossed in a bit of humor to turn their      spare time into cash.<br />      <br />      You can puzzle for profit, too! Just how much money you      make for any given word search quiz, of course, will depend      on the payment policy of the publication in question . . .      and on the size of the brainteaser itself. An 11 X 11      square (that is, a letter grid containing 11 rows of 11      letters each) may pay as little as $6.00. On the other      hand, selling a 21 X 23 "biggie" to a widely circulated      national magazine could bring $100 or more. In my      experience, though, $15 is an average payment for a medium      sized square.<br />      <br />      Those seemingly small amounts can really add up, however,      when you consider that-with practice-you can construct a      salable word-search puzzle in a little over an hour. I      spend about 15 hours a week on this sideline myself and net      more than $600 a month!<br />      <br />      <strong>HOW TO GET STARTED</strong><br />      <br />      To develop a feel for this unique craft and for what      editors buy-study a variety of word search magazines.      Scrutinize each puzzle carefully (paying particular      attention to the relationship between the title and the      word list, and to the way words are fit into the grid), and      try to imagine the process the author went through to      produce that particular game.<br />      <br />      Usually, your first step is to come up with a basic subject      for the puzzle. You can build a theme around almost any      topic: famous people or places, hobbies, activities,      holidays, events, nature, careers . . . you name it. Then      think of a title-and a list of words-relating to that      subject. Some puzzles are fairly straightforward in this      regard: One of my creations, for instance, was called "Eggs      citing" and included words describing how eggs can be      cooked (baked, coddled, scrambled, etc.). Others, however,      take a somewhat less direct approach . . . as in the puzzle      that I captioned "What's Up?", which listed such diverse      words as balloon, cloud, elevator, heads, inflation,      soprano, and Venus.<br />      <br />      In any case, keep in mind that <em>unusual</em> titles, or      those that employ a play on words, are generally preferred      by submissions editors .. . and can spell the difference      between a sale and a rejection. And to get more mileage out      of your ideas, always try to come up with more than one      title for any given puzzle. Then you can simply change the      initial word list somewhat, tack on a different heading,      and-presto-you'll have another moneymaking idea to turn      into a puzzle. For example, I recently sold two different      pieces based on similar lists of archaeological terms . . .      one was titled "Can You Dig It?", and the other "Sticks and      Stones and Ancient Bones".<br />      <br />      Actually, conceiving puzzles can be a lot of fun . . . and      you don't even have to schedule extra time to do it. Those      otherwise idle minutes you tick off while riding on the bus      or waiting in lines and offices make perfect "working      hours". My family makes a game of brainstorming titles and      word lists while we do our daily chores. Children      especially love this form of play as a rainy-day or travel      activity.<br />      <br />      Just be sure, though, that you jot your ideas down! I      always carry a pocket-sized memo notebook with me for this      purpose. Remember, too, that if you intend to earn a      consistent income as a puzzle writer, you'll have to      generate a fairly steady flow of submissions. I've found      that typing the new ideas from my notebook onto 5 X 8 index      cards once a week-and then filing the thought starters for      future reference-really helps. I put the title and sample      word list on the front of the card, reserving the back to      use for recording submittals by date mailed, date returned,      and payment received (if any). That way, I have a ready      supply of fresh puzzle ideas to develop while I'm waiting      for a decision on earlier works . . . <em>and</em> a simple      record keeping system!<br />      <br />      <strong>CONSTRUCTION</strong><br />      <br />      All you need to "build" a puzzle is a good title, a list of      appropriate words, and . . . well, a certain amount of      diligence.<br />      <br />      If you've studied the answer diagrams in published      brainteasers, you've undoubtedly noticed that words [1]      must contain a minimum of three letters, [2] may be spelled      forward or backward, and [3] can be placed horizontally,      vertically, or diagonally. You may also have noticed that      <em>at least 75Â°7o of</em> the letters in any given      solution are found in circled words (editors frown on too      much "empty" space).<br />      <br />      Keeping those factors in mind, start laying out your puzzle      on quarter-inch graph paper. The exact size <em>of</em>      your creation, obviously, will be determined by the number      <em>of</em> words you include. For our purposes, though,      let's say that there are between 30 and 40 words on your      list . . . in which case a 15 X 15 square should be about      right. Using a ruler, draw that box on the paper.<br />      <br />      Now, start fitting words into the space: Pencil a word in      (using a good dictionary to check each word even if it      "looks right" to you) . . . scan your list for another that      might intersect with one you've already placed (or that      will tuck neatly into an open space) . . . write it in . .      . and go on until the grid is nearly full and you've      exhausted your list. Then fill in the empty spaces with      random letters.<br />      <br />      I've found that it's usually best to insert the longer      words around the perimeter <em>of</em> the square first.      Then I fill in the remainder <em>of</em> the puzzle a      section at a time with the shorter ones. As you work, try      to vary the direction <em>of</em> the words . . . and don't      hesitate to add new words to your list <em>if you</em> need      them to fill gaps. Whatever you do, be sure to check each      one off your list as you use it, and lightly circle the      word on the diagram. Otherwise, you may lose track of which      words you've used, and <em>of</em> where you've placed      them!<br />      <br />      Chances are, you'll find constructing word search puzzles a      real challenge at first. But eventually-with practice and      patience -you'll develop your own word-fitting tricks and      techniques . . . and before you know it, you'll be      diagramming like a pro!<br />      <br />      <strong>BREAKING IN</strong><br />      <br />      The best source for publications that purchase word-search      puzzles is <em>Writer's Market,</em> a book published      annually that lists buyers' addresses, editorial      requirements, and payment rates (you'll find good prospects      not only in the "Puzzles" section, but also among some      <em>of</em> the more extensive consumer- and trade-magazine      listings). You can buy the 1984 edition for $18.95 at most      bookstores, or-for an additional $1.50 to cover postage and      handling-direct from Writer's Digest, Inc., Dept. TMEN,      9933 Alliance Road, Cincinnati, Ohio 45242. Most libraries      have the book, too.<br />      <br />      It's always a good idea to <em>query</em> a magazine      regarding its current needs and general policies before you      actually submit work for consideration. The periodical you      have in mind may already be overstocked with puzzles on a      certain theme, for example, or may be scouting around for      word searches geared toward a particular holiday or event.      And you may save yourself an unpleasant surprise by finding      out beforehand whether the magazine pays on acceptance or      only on publication (which can mean that there'll be a      delay of several months before you get a check).<br />      <br />      Be sure to request a copy <em>of</em> the buyer's puzzle      guidelines, as well. Some editors want to see a title and      sample word list before they'll give a go-ahead to      construct the puzzle itself. Others insist on seeing      finished puzzles, but only those that meet specific size      criteria. Guidelines can help you tailor your submission to      the editor's exact requirements, and can also alert you to      a magazine's particular taboos (virtually <em>all</em>      puzzle publications ban brand names, profanity, sexual      terms, and ethnic labels).<br />      <br />      <em>Of</em> course, editors will always reject sloppily      prepared or incorrect submissions. Perfect execution is a      <em>must</em> in this business, since it takes only one      wrong letter to completely ruin a puzzle. Here's how to put      together a professional-quality submission:<br />      <br />      [1] Type the word list and the puzzle and answer diagrams      on separate sheets <em>of</em> 8-1/2 X 11 white bond (don't      use onionskin or<br />      <br />      erasable paper) ... and mack topics for your files. Recheck      the spelling of the words on your list and in your      diagrams.<br />      <br />      [2] Type your name, address, and Social Security number in      the upper left corner of each sheet. Come down three spaces      . . . type the puzzle's title . . . and then-three spaces      below that-begin typing the list, letter grid, or answer      diagram.<br />      <br />      [3] Alphabetize and double-space the word list. Divide the      roster evenly into no more than three columns.<br />      <br />      [4] Double-space the letters, both horizontally and      vertically, on your diagrams. Use capital letters only.      When preparing the answer diagram, circle each word neatly,      using black india ink.<br />      <br />      [5] Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your      submission. Mail the material flat in a legal-sized      envelope, and send it first class-not at a manuscript      rate-to avoid unnecessary delays. (You'll find that sending      a publication five or more submissions at a time-I've      included as many as 15 -will save you money. In any event,      be sure that both your package and the return envelope      carry sufficient postage.)<br />      <br />      Most magazines respond to submissions within three weeks.      (Meanwhile, you can be working on your next batch of      puzzles!) If you don't hear from the editor within a month,      send a polite follow-up note. And don't let rejection slips      get you down . . . they're an inevitable part of a      free-lancer's life. Puzzle editors tend to be friendly      folks and-because competition in this market is relatively      low-they'll often give helpful advice to beginners. Just      keep trying . . . and, sooner or later, you're sure to make      your first sale!    </p>            <p>      <strong>A CHALLENGE</strong><br />      <br />      In case you need a little extra inspiration to get you      started in this business, I've worked up a word-search      puzzle for you to solve. It's based on my observations a      few rears back when I visited MOTHER's EcoVillage . . . and      you shouldn't find the solution terribly difficult. What      I'm hoping is that it'll get you to thinking, "Gee, I could      put together a puzzle like this." Because the fact is, you      can-anybody can-and get paid for doing it!    </p>
