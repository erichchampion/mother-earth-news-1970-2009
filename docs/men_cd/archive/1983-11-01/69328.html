One? Two? If      you're adventurous, perhaps you raise as many as five or      ten. Well, prepare to stand in awe of Lance Ladd, the owner      of an eastern Connecticut nursery. This year, Ladd grew not      25 . . . not 50 . . . not even 100 . . . but 145      <em>different tomato cultivars!</em><br />      <br />      You see, Lance's business sponsors an annual weeklong      tomato festival in Windham, Connecticut. The event, held in      late August, brings together 'mater lovers from all over      New England. Originally conceived of as a means of      publicizing the family nursery (Ladd, 26, returned the      horticultural enterprise to family ownership some 20 years      after his grandfather had sold it), the festival has taken      on a life of its own. It includes, in addition to a tour of      the gardens, a taste testing of all the varieties      <em>and</em> a vote to establish which is the most      delicious tomato. Also, prizes are awarded for the biggest      and smallest fruits, for the most strangely shaped ones,      and for the most uniform cluster from a single plant.<br />      <br />      But the stars of the show are still the 145 test plantings.      Ladd started three years ago with fewer than 50 varieties.      This year he's almost tripled that first planting, and for      1984, well, 200 would be a nice, round number ....<br />      <br />      The test garden occupies about an acre, and is divided into      sections containing early, mid season, and late cultivars,      both determinate and indeterminate . . . cherry and other      small varieties . . . and plum and paste tomatoes. At least      six plants of every cultivar are set out, and some of each      are mulched with hay. Once the seedlings are in place, Ladd      practices modified benign neglect: He provides no water or      irrigation, and he uses no fungicides or pesticides. Some      5-10-10 fertilizer is incorporated into the soil when the      field is prepared, but no additional fertilizer is applied.      In fact, about the only attention the test planting      receives is an occasional hoeing and-time permitting      -handpicking of insects.<br />      <br />      This year's tomato test was instructive in a number of      ways. Connecticut, along with much of the rest of the      nation, suffered from a succession of hot, dry days all      summer long. Under these scorching near-drought conditions,      the value of mulching showed very clearly: Mulched and      unmulched plantings located side by side dramatized how      well the hay helped hold moisture in the soil. The      differences among the varieties Ladd grew were clear, too.      Plants with poor heat or disease resistance curled up and      died, while resistant varieties braved the heat and set      quantities of fruit.<br />      <br />      Among the best producers in Ladd's 1983 Tomato Sweepstakes      were Park's Whopper . . . Monte Carlo, an indeterminate mid      season you could put your money on . . . Sweet-N-Early, a      very early and quite productive cherry tomato . . .      Glamour, an early indeterminate cultivar . . . Small Fry,      another cherry tomato . . . Napoli, a high yielding plum      tomato . . . and Burpee's Jubilee, the best of the      yellow-fruited kind. And, at the end of a week's tasting,      Sweet-N-Early was chosen the most flavorful, with Park's      Whopper a close second.<br />      Lance Ladd has already started planning next year's      festival . .. while his mother, Norma, who shares the      family love of numbers (she raises 40 kinds of peppers), is      busy cooking up a lion's share of this year's crop. Given      the quantities she has to deal with, it's understandable      that the Ladds have accumulated a considerable number of      recipes, and Norma has put together a festival cookbook      called <em>Tomatoes With Love.</em> If rural Windham is      beyond your reach, you can order a copy of the cookbook for      $3.00 postpaid from Norma Douglass Ladd, Dept. TMEN, P.O.      Box 182 South Windham, Connecticut 06266.<br />      <br />      <strong>HANDLE WITH CARE</strong><br />      <br />      According to a report in the September American      Horticulturist (Dept. TMEN, American Horticultural Society,      Mount Vernon, Virginia 22121, membership $20 a year), there      well may be a health hazard involved in handling sphagnum      moss. A potentially serious disease called sporotrichosis,      spread by the fungus Sporotrichum <em>schenckii, can</em>      cause grave damage to the lymphatic system . . . and is      sometimes fatal. The fungus lives in soil and has been      found in sphagnum moss used to pack tree seedlings. It      enters the body through cuts or scratches in the skin, and      causes an inflamed blister that slowly enlarges. If not      caught and treated early, the infection can ultimately      involve the entire lymphatic system. Darroll D. Skilling,      principal plant pathologist at the North Carolina Forest      Experiment Station, recommends that gardeners avoid      handling trees that have been packed in sphagnum moss. If      you do have to work with the material, he suggests that you      wash your hands frequently and treat cuts and scrapes      promptly. (It seems to me that wearing gloves would be a      good prophylactic measure, too.)<br />      <br />      <strong>HOLIDAY BOOKS FOR GARDENERS</strong><br />      <br />      With the winter holidays rapidly approaching, a visit to      the Gardener's Bookshelf seems very much in order. Ortho,      the producer of fine garden books as well as of      agricultural chemicals of questionable necessity      <em>(especially</em> for the home garden), has just issued      the massive <em>Ortho's Complete Guide to Successful      Gardening.</em> The 504-page tome, which is available at      most bookstores and garden centers, sells for $24.95 and is      profusely illustrated with color photos. While the volume      covers all aspects of home gardening, the most extensive      section is devoted to shrubs and hedges.<br />      <br />      From Sterling Publishing comes a trio of superb garden      books originally published in England by Blandford. My      favorite is <em>Plant Propagation for the Home      Gardener</em> by John I. Wright ($16.95), an exhaustive      treatment of the subject. After chapters on cuttings,      seeds, division, layering, grafting, budding, greenhouses,      frames, and propagators, the last 150 pages are devoted to      details on reproducing what appear to be well over a      thousand different cultivars. For each, Wright gives the      plant's scientific and popular names. the method of      propagation, the treatment required, the appropriate time      of year for planting, and specific notes on culture. I      wouldn't be without it.<br />      <br />      For lovers of indoor plants, Brian and Wilma      Rittershausen's <em>Orchids as Indoor Plants is</em> a most      useful volume. The paperback ($7.95) is illustrated in      color <em>and</em> black and white, and covers both      choosing orchids for the home and caring for the plants.      And yet another delectable holiday gift would be Gunter      Andersohn's <em>Cacti and Succulents</em> ($19.95).      Completely illustrated in color, this book describes, and      gives information on culture for, nearly every cactus under      the sun (which is, after all, just where they prefer to      be). I can't think of a better present for folks interested      in the desert plants.    </p>
