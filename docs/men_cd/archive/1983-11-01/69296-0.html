        [1] To make a printed circuit board, you'll need the Radio Shack kit, a drill, and a circuit layout. [2] Start by cleaning the protective coating from the copper side of the board. [3] Then mark the circuit path with the special pen. [4] Place the marked board in the etchant solution and agitate it frequently. [5] Clean off the board with water and follow with the cleansing mixture. Be sure to wipe off the ink left on the circuit path.
