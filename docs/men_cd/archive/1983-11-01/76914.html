                    <p>      Bill Ickes extends the life of his sandpaper by gluing      inexpensive polyester fabric scraps to the backs of the      abrasive sheets before he uses them. The Berlin,      Pennsylvania reader says that his fabric-backed sandpaper      lasts longer, wears more evenly, and is more flexible when      used on small, rounded, or odd-shaped objects.<br />      <br />      Cold weather is here, and outdoor enthusiasts would be well      advised to remember a trick that'll insure warmth and      safety as folks journey through the wilds this winter.      Barry Atkins of Seattle, Washington wrote about his      grandfather's practice of dipping the heads of a dozen      matches in melted paraffin wax . . . and then rolling those      matches up in a 10" X 10" piece of cloth. The resultant      "package" was then dipped into the paraffin and allowed to      dry. The waxy bundle can be carried in a pack or pocket.      The matches will stay dry (through rain, snow, sleet, or      worse), and the wax. coated cloth makes a fine fire      starter.<br />      <br />      "When our son, Joshua, was 18 months old, I would run      myself ragged in a usually vain attempt to keep ahead of      his curious fingers. Curtains, electrical cords, plants,      swinging doors, speaker covers, kitchen cabinets . . . the      list of potential trouble spots seemed endless some days!"      writes contributor Gloria Robertson of Nixa, Missouri. "I      finally hit upon a simple solution to the problem, though.      Yarn! I tied colorful pieces of yarn over and through, up      and under, around and on top . . . making pretty bows and      secure knots to hold those items in the position I wanted.      The safety factor (and my peace of mind) far outweighed my      fear of raised eyebrows at the unusual decor . . . and when      josh outgrew that roaming stage, I simply clipped the yarn      bows and stored them away for our next busy one,      Sarah!"<br />      <br />      Phyllis Wolff of Franklinton, North Carolina recycles the      greeting cards she receives at Christmastime by cutting the      pictures on the front into gift tags to use the following      holiday season. For each one, Phyllis cuts out a particular      shape, punches a hole in the top, strings a piece of      crochet cotton through, and then stores the labels until      mistletoe-and-holly time rolls around again.<br />      <br />      Toluca Lake, California resident Ellen Siegler offers      fellow MOTHER readers these tips on shopping for nearly new      toys and games at garage sales and thrift shops.<br />      <br />      Although it's fairly easy to clean up an old dolly's face      and clothing, restoring dull, matted hair can often present      a problem. The solution? Ellen recom mends shampooing the      doll's locks in liquid fabric softener, rinsing them well,      and then brushing them with a small-toothed rubber brush      until the hair dries naturally.<br />      <br />      If the board games or action toys you locate have missing      or broken parts, don't automatically reject them. Should      such a toy still be available at retail outlets, Ellen      takes the object home and then composes a friendly letter      to the manufacturer of the product . . . giving pertinent      information such as the name and serial number. (If you      aren't sure of exactly what's missing, just list the parts      you <em>have.)</em> Ellen says most companies are quite      willing to send replacement parts for a nominal fee . . .      and some even send the missing pieces at no cost!<br />      <br />      "When holiday gift-shopping time rolls around each year,      folks are often stumped about what to give Grandma and      Grandpa," writes Rosalind Milliken of Indio, California.      "Not only do these matriarchs and patriarchs usually have a      lifetime's accumulation of tools and gadgets, but many      times they also have well-stocked freezers. However, we      manage to delight <em>our</em> older relatives by sending      them packing boxes full of paper goods each year.<br />      <br />      We supply them with everything imaginable . . . greeting      cards, stationery, paper plates and napkins, gift wrap,      waxed paper, toilet tissue, postage stamps, paper towels,      and more. They're as pleased as can be with these gifts,      and we're happy that we're able to pare down their everyday      living expenses for the coming year." And here's a tip      concerning those promises we always seem to make to      ourselves every January, but have a difficult time      <em>keeping.</em> Debbie O'Neal has a system that works      well for her. The St. Paul, Minnesota reader learns (or at      least <em>tries)</em> one new thing every single month of      the year. For example, last year she taught herself candle      wicking in January . . . read a book about famous artists      in February . . . learned how to cook with herbs in March .      . . and so forth. Debbie says that by focusing on one      project each month, she helps make every year memorable and      worthwhile.    </p>        <p>      Hanover, Pennsylvania reader Scott Hoffman hauls firewood      downstairs the easy way. Scott <em>slides</em> his wood      down the steps to his basement furnace, using an aluminum      slide from a child's discarded swing set .... Jamie Tackman      of Twisp, Washington checks the level of her propane tank      by splashing water on the bottle's side. As the moisture      evaporates, she checks for a condensation line, which      generally appears at the point where the fuel levels off .      . . . If you wear contact lenses, you know the frustration      involved in searching for a dropped lens. Well, Holcomb,      Illinois reader Walt Busky fords his lost contacts easily      by making the "scene of the crime" as dark as possible, and      then using the rays of a flashlight to search for the      optical aid. The lens should sparkle as it reflects the      light .... Charles Wilbur of Traverse City, Michigan      recycles used hair dryers as "automatic bellows" for his      fireplace and wood stove. Charles says the pistol-shaped,      hand-held blow dryers are great for coaxing near-dead      embers back to life .... Key West, Florida reader Gregory      Coleman keeps his coffee from "brewing bitter" by crushing      eggshells and lining the filters of his coffee maker with      them. He says the remaining residue of egg white on the      shells removes the bitter taste from even the      <em>hardest</em> tap water .... A cribbage board is a great      help to folks who knit or crochet, according to Blanche      Berger of Dryden, Michigan. Blanche uses the board to keep      track of rows and stitches by working out a system with the      different pegs .... Make your own biscuit mix! Dawn Bauer      of Kenosha, Wisconsin does so by mixing together 6 cups of      flour, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, a dash of salt, and      1-112 cups of shortening. She stores the crumbly mixture in      plastic bags or containers for future use, when she may add      water and an egg .... A rusty knife blade can be made as      good as new by plunging it through an onion, says Mrs.      Gordon Pullman of Jackson, Ohio. She leaves the blade      inside the onion for an hour or two, then works it back and      forth several times before removing it .... When Tina      Schriver of Meeker, Colorado bakes bread, she always keeps      a plastic bag nearby to stick one hand in when the      inevitable ring of the telephone sounds as she's knead-deep      in dough!<br />      <br />      <em>Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, down home, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday</em> life. <em>Why      not share your best "horse sense" with the rest of MOTHER's      readers?
