                    <h5 id="byline">by Jay Hensley</h5>    <hr />    <p>      Meet an unusual animal that just might prove to be the      ideal family horse.			</p>        <p>      Raised for centuries on the southern slopes of the Ural      Mountains in Russia, Bashkir Curlies--named for their      remarkably wavy winter coats served as beasts of burden,      means A of transportation, and sources of<br />      <br />      both meat and milk for that region's people. And-like their      stouthearted ancestors-the modern-day American members of      the breed are hardy enough to withstand high altitudes and      extreme weather conditions, as well as being agile enough      to maneuver across rugged terrain.<br />      <br />      The Curly is also one of the gentlest (and most      intelligent!) breeds of horse imaginable. Since they      possess an unusual affinity for humans, the animals can be      easily broken and trained. In addition, when confronted      with a new or threatening situation, they rarely shy or      bolt in the way<br />      that most of their equine relatives do. Instead, they      generally stand their ground and face the problem.<br />      <br />      <strong>SAYS WHO?</strong><br />      <br />      Since you probably won't find mention of the Bashkir Curly      in the encyclopedia, dictionary, or even in your favorite      horse book, you might (understandably!) be wondering if      this breed really exists. Indeed, few people do know about      this horse... because there aren't that many of them and      they've only recently been officially declared a breed.      But, believe me, the folks who do know Curlies all seem to      love them.<br />      <br />      Take 76-year-old Bill Valentine in Wales, North Dakota, for      instance. Bill brags that his elderly Curly mare, Dolly, is      so gentle that his 2-1/2-year-old grandson won two classes      with her at a local horse show last summer.<br />      <br />      Urbana, Ohio resident Rhonda McQuinn obtained a Curly      stallion through an adopt a wild-horse program last year.      Expecting to spend months breaking and training her new      acquisition, she was amazed to find that it took only a      couple of days to have her rough and-ready mount      saddle-broken and behaving as well as a seasoned pleasure      pony! "Why, he's just a big baby!" Rhonda reports.<br />      <br />      Sunny Martin of Ely, Nevada-who is the breed registry      secretary-says, "Curlies really do take to people. I've      never seen anything like it!" And she should know, because      she's been on hand to watch many of these horses be brought      in from the range . . . fight that "one good fight" at the      end of a rope . . . and settle down almost immediately into      friendly, tractable animals.<br />      <br />      One of Sunny's favorite Curly stories (and she's gathered      so many of them she's decided to write a book about the      breed) is about a Connecticut mount named Fazie.      Fazie--true to his heritage-did not like to be pampered,      and he had a pretty clever way of letting his owners<br />      know it. In cold weather, his overly attentive masters      swaddled him in a horse blanket. But just as soon as his      owners were out of sight, Fazie undid the two surcingles      under his belly with his teeth, and then (unable to      manipulate the buckle under his chest to release the      blanket) he reached over his back . . . caught the rug in      his teeth .. . pulled the whole thing over his head . ..      and deposited it neatly in the corner of his stall. Spying      on him one day, Fazie's owners got the<br />      message and quit coddling him!<br />      <br />      There are countless other tales extolling Curlies, and many      of them might seem a bit hard to swallow at first. "Believe      them!" says Ed Brice, of the Kentucky Horse Park in      Lexington. "Curlies are so unusual you really need to be      around one of them for a while before you can truly      appreciate the breed." Ed claims that Kewpie, a Curly lent      to the park by Sunny Martin, was so endearing that she      spoiled him and his coworkers on the breed. And now the      park (which displays about 40 different equine breeds) has      its own Curly, Mel's Lucky Boy, to show off!<br />      <br />      <strong>DAMELE'S WILD HERD</strong><br />      <br />      Just how, when, or why Curlies arrived on the North      American continent is left to speculation. Perhaps the      Russians brought them over when they settled Alaska and the      West Coast. Or maybe these hearty beasts carried their      Mongolian masters across the Bering Strait centuries      ago.<br />      <br />      However, it is known for certain that in 1898      eight-year-old Peter Damele made the first recorded      sighting of Curlies in this country. One day, when he and      his father were riding in the remote high country of      central Nevada, the youngster caught sight of three      strange-looking horses with tight fur ringlets all over      their bodies.<br />      <br />      It actually wasn't until 50 years later that the Dameles      brought some Curlies in from the ranges and tamed them.      That year as the result of a killer winter most of the      family's ranch horses either froze or starved to death. So      the cowpokes were forced to domesticate the only equines      left . . . the rough-and-ready Curlies!<br />      <br />      And the Dameles soon discovered how remarkable Curlies      really are! Naturally athletic and keenly intelligent,      these animals are easy to care for. They require neither      shoes nor fancy food, and their thick winter coats, which      are shed (along with their manes) in early spring, rarely      get<br />      parasites. What's more, many folks who are allergic to      horse hair find that they're not allergic to Curlies.<br />      <br />      <strong>REGISTRY SAVES LIVES</strong><br />      <br />      Eventually, the Dameles enlarged their herd and sold some      of the Bashkir horses here and there. As a consequence,      many of the Curlies you see today are direct descendants of      that Nevada herd. Unfortunately, when Curlies became more      widespread, a lot of people mistook the wavy coated      critters for genetically defective equines . . . and      decided to slaughter them. In 1971-in part to put an end to      this sort of senseless killing-the American Bashkir Curly      Registry was established. Curlies constituted, at long      last, a recognized and respected breed!<br />      <br />      The registry accepts any color-even Appaloosa and Pinto-and      allows for double registry (as in the case of Curly-Aps,      for instance) just as long as the horse in question      displays the telltale three- to six-inch-long kinky winter      coat and good conformation. Currently, there are only about      245 registered purebred Curlies in the United States, and      most of these horses are located in Nevada, California, and      Oregon.<br />      <br />      Granted, then, the supply of American Bashkir Curlies is      limited . . . but if you're interested in purchasing one or      merely want to learn more about this extraordinary breed,      write to Sunny Martin (The American Bashkir Curly Registry,      Dept. TMEN, Box 453, Ely, Nevada 89301) and ask her to send      you information and/or a copy of a recent ABCR newsletter      (which comes out twice a year and lists Curlies for sale,      as well as stallions that are available for stud service).      There's no charge for the information or the publication,      but Sunny asks that you please enclose a self addressed,      double stamped envelope with your correspondence. [EDITOR'S      NOTE: We suggest that you enclose a dollar to defray her      costs, as well. And Mrs. Martin says that Curly prices are      extremely reasonable in comparison with those of      other<br />      purebreds.<br />      <br />      The American Bashkir Curly: It just may be the perfect      horse for the homesteader in search of an equine for all      seasons and all reasons!    </p>    <hr />
