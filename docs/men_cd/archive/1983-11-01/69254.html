                <p>      You'll bring a bit of the tropics right into your own home      when you...    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Laurie Baggiani</h5>    <p>      The mention of palms usually conjures up images of romantic      South Sea Islands with exotic fruits, dazzling white sand      beaches, crystal clear lagoons, and bronzed, flower decked      dancers swaying against an ocean-blue sky. Unfortunately,      many of us will never visit such fabled lands, but there's      no reason why we can't bring those faraway isles to our own      hearths and homes . . . by growing some tropical      palms!<br />      <br />      This elegant greenery-related to grasses and bamboo-is      remarkably tolerant of neglect (in fact, it'll almost take      care of itself) and relatively resistant to diseases and      insects. Why, these hearty perennials are actually      <em>noted for</em> their tolerance of "atrocities" such as      low light levels, ,root crowded containers, infrequent      watering, and air-conditioning.<br />      <br />      What's more, few plant species in history have enjoyed the      stature that palms have earned: Since early Egyptian and      Babylonian cultures, they have been honored as      <em>principles,</em> the "princes of plants". But their      most valuable attribute-in the eyes of the "informed"      gardener-may well be their wonderful versatility. With 210      genera and 2,780 species, the Palmae family (also known as      Arecaceae) offers varieties native to warm and temperate      climates alike. 'True, the majority come from Southeast      Asia and tropical America, where they live -as the Arabs      say-"with their feet in the water and their heads on fire".      Others, though, take root as far north as Virginia and as      far south as central Chile.    </p>        <p>      <strong>FEATHERS AND FANS</strong><br />      <br />      As you might expect, the very fact that they have such      diversified habitats makes generalizing about palms rather      difficult. Fortunately, however, a basic botanical division      of the plants into "feather" and "fan" types-based on their      leaf structure does provide a useful framework for      exploring these exotics.<br />      <br />      By and large, the most popular (and congenial) decorative      palms are the feather types. These include the species of      <em>Chamaedorea, Chrysalidocarpus, Howea,</em> and      <em>Phoenix.</em> All have pinnate fronds that resemble      large feathers or fingers (see Fig. 1). In fact, palms      derive their name from this likeness to the human      hand.<br />      <br />      Most of the members of this first group will thrive in      warm, indoor conditions . . .<br />      where temperatures are between 62 ° and 65 °F at      night and as high as 80 80' to 85'F during the day. While      almost all are shade tolerant, several are shade-loving, so      they provide tough and unusual foliage for deco rating that      difficult north window. Other feather palms prefer the      stronger light that's supplied by eastern or western      exposures. South window settings, on the other hand, may      prove too bright for many of<br />      these evergreens. (If you choose such a sunny location,      consider hanging a thin curtain over the window to filter      out some of the light.) With these facts in mind, here's a      selection of some of these perennial favorites or indoor      gardening.<br />      <br />      <strong>Areca</strong> <em>(Chrysalidocarpus      lutescens):</em> Known to some as the "yellow butterfly      palm", this Madagascar native-with its long, thin, draping      leaves of a glossy, dark green hue, and green and golden      stems ringed like bamboo-is one of the most graceful palms.      A dense, cluster-forming variety, areca eventually becomes      quite full. Indoors, it's one of the few palms that prefers      a little water in the saucer beneath its pot.<br />      <br />      <strong>Bamboo Palm</strong> <em>(Chamaedorea      erumpens):</em> This suckering plant from Honduras looks      more like a clump of bamboo than a palm (hence its name).      The arching, paper like, dark green leaves located along      reed like stems are prized mainly for their Oriental      appearance.<br />      <br />      <strong>Blue leaf Chamaedorea</strong> <em>(Chamaedorea      glaucifolia):</em> Another bamboo like palm, this slow      climber has long, narrow, gray green leaves that are      <em>very</em> sparsely located along its stems.<br />      <br />      <strong>Miniature Fishtail</strong> <em>(Chamaedorea      metallica):</em> As one of the smallest palms, this tough      and unusual plant is perfect for adding beauty to small      spaces. Bearing a rosette of toothed, somewhat plaited,      shiny green leaves (which fork only near their apexes) on a      slender green stem, C. <em>metallica</em> gradually grows      to about three feet in height.<br />      <br />      <strong>Parlor Palm</strong> <em>(Chamaedorea      elegans):</em> The well-known "dwarf mountain palm" is a      favorite among indoor gardeners . . . and for good reason,      since it tolerates all kinds of abuse! A fast      grower-reaching to ten feet or more-with slightly      transparent, featherlike fronds, the parlor palm blossoms      into a full, bush like ornamental.<br />      <br />      <strong>Neanthe Bella</strong> <em>(Chamaedorea elegans      bella):</em> This miniature version of the parlor palm      seldom grows taller than four feet indoors. Every bit as      accommodating as its larger relative, nepen the bella      flowers when it's quite young, and its numerous suckers      make it easy to propagate.<br />      <br />      <strong>Curly Sentry Palm</strong> <em>(Howea      'belmoreana):</em> The <em>Howea</em> variety of palms      (sometimes spelled <em>Howeia),</em> a relatively new      discovery to indoor gardeners, is native only to Lord Howe      Island in the Pacific. The striking evergreendecked with      wide-spreading, pointed, broad fronds-is gaining      popularity, though it requires a bit of room . . . needs      careful nurturing when young .<br />      <br />      prefers a cooler environment (50° to 70°F) than do      most other feather palms . . . and hates to be disturbed      by, for example, repotting. Putting on a regally handsome      display, the curly sentry is the <em>Howea</em> often found      in hotel lobbies and the like, since this plant, once      mature, is notably tolerant of abuse and low light.<br />      <br />      <strong>Kentia Palm</strong> <em>(Howea forsterana):</em>      This is another <em>Howea</em> that's widely kept for its      tropical appearance and tolerant nature. While it grows      more erect than the curly sentry, it's equally elegant and      sturdy. You may find larger specimens rather tough on your      pocketbook, though, since-because the seed requires about      six years to become viablethis is one of the most difficult      species to propagate.<br />      <br />      <strong>Pygmy Date Palm</strong> <em>(Phoenix      roebeleni:):</em> Sometimes called the "dwarf date palm",      this airy, exotic plant has a dense globular crown of plume      like leaves that arch in space. Though often suggested for      very shady locations, it actually grows best if it receives      some direct sun. The female trees frequently cluster and      are easily propagated by division.<br />      <br />      <strong>FANS FOR COOLNESS</strong><br />      <br />      If you're wondering about foliage that could adapt to the      more difficult areas of your home spaces that are as chilly      as 50° to 55 °F at night, while warming up to only      65° to 70°F in the daytime-you merely have to enter      the world of fan palms.<br />      <br />      Categorized by their palmate leaf structure (see Fig. 2),      most fan palms <em>enjoy</em> cooler air. In addition,      unlike feather palms, most members of this group require      some direct sunlight. Popular species for indoor gardens      include the <em>Chamaerops, Coccothrinax, Livistona,      Rhapis,</em> and <em>Washingtonia.</em> Here's a sampling      of some of the most popular specimens.<br />      <br />      <strong>European Fan Palm</strong> <em>(Chamaerops      humilis):</em> The only palm species native to Spain, the      European comes in many forms It makes an excellent,      low-spreading tub plant-growing to a yard in width-with      thin, stiff leaves that range from light to dark green and      are pointed at the tip.<br />      <br />      <strong>Florida Silver Palm</strong> <em>(Coccothrinax      argentata):</em> This small exotic-a warmthloving fan      palm-is a delicate beauty, sporting star shaped leaves that      are glossy green on top and silvery white underneath. As      the species seldom grows taller than three feet, you'll      probably find it one of the easier fan palms to      accommodate.<br />      <br />      <strong>Chinese Fan or Fountain Palm</strong> (Live      <em>istona chinensis):</em> This spectacular variety from      southern China has glossy leaves (they're more broad than      long) that are cut into narrow, fringe like segments. Since      its fronds can spread up to eight yards in diameter, the      Chinese fan requires a lot of room. (If you don't have the      floor space, you may want to try elevating it up on a      shelf, so that the branches spread high enough to walk      under!)<br />      <br />      <strong>Lady Palm</strong> <em>(Rhapis excelsa):</em> A      smaller, suckering species, the lady palm is an enduring      classic that bears shiny, rigid, dark green leaves (divided      nearly to the base into from three to ten segments). Unlike      many other fan palms, it's a heavy feeder and accepts warm      and cool temperatures alike.<br />      <br />      <strong>Variegated Lady Palm</strong> <em>(Rhapis excelsa      variegata):</em> This Japanese cultivar of the lady palm      prefers homes at 68° to 80°F Though a slow grower,      it's prized for the alternate ivory white and green bands      that decorate its fronds.<br />      <br />      <strong>Slender Lady Palm</strong> <em>(Rhapis      humilis):</em> Not only is <em>Rhapis humilis</em> probably      the best of the lady palms for indoor cultivation, it's      also one of the daintiest. Prized for its ability to      withstand cool or warm temperatures, it grows into a dense,      clustering shrub with thin, reedlike stems and narrow,      pointed leaves that are divided into 9 to 20      segments.<br />      <br />      <strong>Petticoat Palm</strong> <em>(Washingtonia</em>      <em>fil</em> <em>ifera):</em> This is the "desert fan palm"      from the arid Southwest. Its thorny, plaited, gray . green      leaves are lined with long, threadlike fibers and do indeed      resemble a petticoat. Those of you who live in dry, hot      climates may want to plant this type outdoors.<br />      <br />      <strong>Mexican Fan Palm</strong> <em>(Washingtonia      robusta):</em> The enormous, wide-spreading, glossy, bright      green foliage of this palm is magnificent to behold. Though      the Mexican fan's usually planted outside, if raised      indoors-with bright sunlight, warm temperatures, and lots      of space-it can be quite breathtaking.<br />      <br />      <strong>A GROWING PLAN</strong><br />      <br />      If you want to learn the nuts and bolts of caring for a      particular palm, you should, of course, know what variety      you're raising and what its eccentricities are (although      some palms have such similar appearances that identifying      your plant may be no small task). Still, the following      guidelines on care can <em>generally</em> be relied      upon.<br />      <br />      <strong>Cold:</strong> To begin, whether your houseplant is      fan or feather, one thing's for sure: It won't like cold      air. Keep it out of drafts. Sudden winter blasts coming      through an open door or window may cause yellow leaves,      browning, and eventual leaf loss.<br />      <br />      <strong>Light:</strong> A good rule of thumb when raising a      palm (or any other houseplant) is to give it as much light      as possible without burning the leaves. In general, those      with thick, tough, leathery foliage prefer several hours of      <em>direct</em> sunlight each day, while those with thin,      semitransparent fronds do best with medium exposure.<br />      <br />      <strong>Watering:</strong> Most of these exotics like      neither to dry out completely <em>nor</em> to sit in water      too long (though they may tolerate either condition). For      optimum growth, it's best to water <em>thoroughly</em> when      the top one quarter to one-half inch of soil becomes dry to      the touch. Once you've quenched a palm's thirst, let the      pot drain . . . and empty the saucer beneath it. And keep      an eye out for brown tips on the leaves: They may be a      signal that the plant has been sitting in water too      long.<br />      <br />      <strong>Feeding:</strong> Since watering leaches nutrients      from the soil (no matter how good your medium), you'll      eventually need to fertilize your plants. Always keep in      mind, though, that most palms are light feeders. Hence a      mixture of diluted fish emulsion (a highnitrogen      fertilizer)-given only a few times in the summer and never      in winter-usually proves sufficient.<br />      <br />      <strong>Transplants:</strong> Palms like cozy containers,      so they seldom need reporting. To determine when it is time      to provide more growing space, look for such signs as a      quick-drying plant (the need for too-frequent waterings),      browning fronds, or a pot so small compared with the palm      that the evergreen looks unbalanced.<br />      <br />      When you transplant, use a container that's larger than the      old one by a couple of inches (at most) and fill the extra      space with a mixture of ground-up greenhouse peat or a      package of soil mix (two parts) . . . with perlite and      vermiculite (one part each) added for drainage. And wet      your princes before you switch containers. Unlike many      other houseplants, palms like to be watered thoroughly both      before and after being moved.<br />      <br />      <strong>Grooming:</strong> Keeping your palms well groomed      and near other healthy plants is the best way to ward off      their major enemies: spider mites, scale, and mealybugs.      Tend them by trimming any brown or yellow tips with      sterilized manicure scissors. If a whole frond has      yellowed, remove the dying part by simply cutting it off at      the base. (Once yellow, the leaf won't turn green again.)      Don't worry when an occasional leaf or two becomes      discolored. That's just part of the natural shedding      process. However, a <em>severe</em> loss of foliage may      indicate chilly drafts, too much light, excessive      fertilizer, or inappropriate watering.<br />      <br />      Finally, if the foliage gets dusty, it can be cleaned with      a damp cloth moistened with clear water. But stay away from      commercial plant cleansers. Despite advertising claims,      products designed to make leaves shine are sometimes quite      harmful, since they clog the pores (stoma) and disrupt the      plant's natural transpiration.<br />      <br />      <strong>Pests:</strong> Palms are remarkably resistant to      insect infestations, but if you do get a bug problem, you      may be able to eliminate the pests simply by letting loose      an army of red ladybird beetles. Though the hungry horde      can't catch insects in flight, they'll do a job on all of      the nymphs, eggs, and crawling bugs they stumble across.      This tactic is practically effortless . .. providing, of      course, that you have a supply of ladybugs handy!<br />      <br />      A more time-honored approach to pest eradication is to wipe      the plant down every day or two with warm, soapy water.      (Use a laundry soap, not a detergent, and thoroughly wash      any residue away with lukewarm water.)<br />      <br />      To prevent infestations in the first place, you should      periodically hose down your palms. Do this in the early      morning, so the foliage will be dry by nightfall . . . and,      in the winter, limit such rinsings to no more than once      every six weeks, since lingering moisture on the leaves      makes palms susceptible to fungi.<br />      <br />      <strong>Propagation:</strong> Two common methods of      propagation are totally <em>unsuited</em> to palms . . .      namely, air layering (the distribution of palms' sensitive      inner tissue precludes this option) and tip cutting (which      can damage the "terminal buds"-which are responsible for      the plants' growth activity-and cause the palms to      die).<br />      <br />      However, since many species produce offshoots branching      from the base of the plant or suckers forming below the      soil, <em>division</em> from the "mother" is often the      easiest means of producing additional plants.<br />      <br />      Suckers can be dug up (make sure to retain all the roots)      and .planted directly in soil, while offshoots can be      divided with a sterile, sharp knife (just above the soil      level) and rooted either in a pot of peat moss and perlite      or simply in water . . . and then transferred to soil once      the roots have developed. Gentle heating of the bottom of      the container will help promote root formation, and an      increase in humidity (by either misting the plants daily or      placing them in a plastic tent for several weeks) will also      help the little plants become established.<br />      <br />      Reproduction from seed is the most common method used . . .      and from the abundant supply of palms on this planet, you      might say that it's fairly reliable. Gathering your own      seed, however, will promise uncertain results at best. For      one thing, some species are dioecious (having separate male      and female plants), in which case both types are needed      <em>and</em> you'll have to hand-pollinate the female in      order to produce seed. In the second place, since any seed      must be ripe and planted at precisely the proper time to be      viable, it becomes critical to know the requirements of      your species. For all these reasons, it's often easier to      obtain seed from commercial sources.<br />      <br />      These little nuggets can be sown in sterile clay pots with      broken chips in the bottom to promote drainage. A good      medium to use is leaf-mold soil or peat moss, mixed with      equal parts of loam and sand. This mix is then pasteurized      by bringing the soil temperature to 140 ° to 180 °F      with steam or other moist heat, to prevent damping off. (To      kill undesirable insects, weed seeds, and disease      organisms, sterilize the soil at 212°F for 30      minutes.)<br />      <br />      To plant, water the medium thoroughly, then sow the seed      thinly on top and cover with soil to a depth twice the      seed's thickness. Next, cover the container with glass or      plastic wrap and place it in a shady spot . . .      <em>until</em> the seedlings start to break ground. Water      them when necessary by misting or by placing the pot in a      pan of water. Gentle bottom heating will also help the seed      to germinate and, again, aid root development. Once the      seedlings are established, they can be weaned gradually to      stronger light and then, when they're large enough to      handle, transplanted.    </p>            <p>      <strong>TROPICAL PLEASURES</strong><br />      <br />      Now that you know some of the palm varieties available for      indoor use-and how easy they are to cultivate-there's no      reason to delay bringing a touch of the tropics into your      home. After all, whether you're a seasoned connoisseur of      these tropicals, a weekend gardener with a taste for the      exotic, or a purple-thumbed bumpkin with a budding      curiosity . . . the islands can be yours, and the natives      are friendly.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The Geo.
