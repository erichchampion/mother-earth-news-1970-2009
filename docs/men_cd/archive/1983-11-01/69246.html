                    <p>      <em>This idea could bring in a profit and add beauty to the      world!</em><br />      <br />      Few countries in the world-except perhaps Great      Britain-take horticulture as seriously as does Japan . . .      and, during our Plants and Gardens Tour of that nation last      spring, we had the opportunity to visit some of the most      spectacular examples of Japan's botanical, classical Zen,      and privately owned landscape gardens. Almost equally      impressive, however, were the thousands of exquisite little      beauty spots that graced the entranceways and yards of many      Japanese homes, apartment buildings, and businesses. In the      delightful city of Kurume, a garden center on the southern      island of Kyushu, the mayor had a lovely garden-which he      himself tenderly nurtured right inside his office.<br />      <br />      Kurume, in fact, provided us with evidence of what an      incredibly big business gardening is and has been for      centuries in the Land of the Rising Sun. In Japan, you see,      nurseries seem to cluster in congenial communities of like      interest . . . and in Kurume such businesses number more      than 1,000! There, plant auctions-involving some 200      different species occur six or seven times a month . . .      with total sales topping $10 million a year. (This is      understandable, as well-to-do Japanese might be willing to      pay from $15,000 to $20,000 for a large trained black      pine.)<br />      <br />      Such nursery centers have been flourishing for centuries,      and-over the years-a common horticultural philosophy has      developed. Usually, gardens are continually groomed and      maintained in their original designs, so most show      relatively little change over the decades or even for      hundreds of years-except, of course, for the natural but      controlled aging of plants. And the nursery worker, who is      seen as a very special and talented artisan, plays a major      role in the preservation process, making sure (for example)      that quality plants are available as replacements.<br />      <br />      It's also especially interesting to observe how well      Japan's long-standing horticultural traditions have      resisted the onslaught of technology and mass      merchandising, cautiously incorporating new ideas      <em>without</em> supplanting the old ways.    </p>        		<p>    <strong>"SAMPLE GARDEN" SALES</strong> <strong>MAKE    SENSE</strong><br />    <br />    There is, nevertheless, one innovation that's taken place in    Japanese gardening that might be worthy of consideration in    this country: In various cooperative nursery centers, small    sample gardens are displayed, which show the buyer exactly    what his or her final garden will look like . . . when it's    <em>installed</em> a few days after the purchase. Because    Japanese gardens are traditionally designed on a modular    basis, this enterprise works quite well . . . and similar    operations could, perhaps, be successful here, particularly    as the construction of condominiums and town houses expands    in this country. (Sales opportunities might also exist in    urban centers like Philadelphia and San Francisco, where    yards are often of a rather small and uniform size.)<br />    <br />    In the 22,000-square-meter Kawaguchi Nursery Stock Market    owned by the city of Kawaguchi, for example, a row of sample    gardens has been constructed with the help of a landscape    architect. Though these "instant gardens" are no more than    200 square feet in size, they often employ a remarkable range    of plant materials. A large sign in front of the sample    gardens states the prices of the permanent outdoor displays,    which can range from about $1,200 to $5,000 for the    completely installed garden, including fences, stones, and    other accessories. Nearby, a gardener can also see sample    entrance walks, ornamental bamboo fences, various kinds of    hedges, stones, lanterns, and so on ... displayed in the same    manner that rooms of furniture are arranged in American    stores.<br />    <br />    And it seems likely that an enterprising gardener, nursery    owner, or landscape architect-by borrowing a few ideas and    creating some new ones-could come up with similar examples of    small rock, herb, Victorian, water, or other types of    traditional gardens that would appeal to Westerners who want    to put a bit of natural beauty into a limited space.<br />    <br />    If you already own a nursery or are thinking of opening one,    you'll want to consider that enclosed gardens of this nature    would consist principally of mature plants. The sale of such    specimens, combined with contracts for the maintenance of the    gardens, would almost guarantee a continuing clientele.    What's more, by <em>creating</em> opportunities to own and    care for small but well-groomed gardens, you'd be likely to    stimulate greater interest in horticulture in your community    and, at the same time, offer the urban dweller an exotic    contrast to the standard charcoal broiler and deck chairs    that so often decorate small patios and backyards!		</p>
