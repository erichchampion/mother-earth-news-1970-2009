                    <h5 id="byline">by Alfredo D. Barela</h5>        <p>      Like many people, I'm attracted to folk music . . .      primarily because I like its innate "personal" quality.      While folk tunes often do reflect universal human feelings      and ideas, they're just as often played on instruments      created by the individual performer. A good example of this      sort of music maker is the African "thumb piano" (also      known as the <em>mbira, zanza,</em> or <em>kalimba)</em> .      . . which isn't a piano at all, but can be more accurately      classed as a plucked idiophone. Appearing throughout Africa      in virtually whatever shape strikes the musician's fancy,      the mbira may have tines made of any springy material from      metal to rattan, while the whole instrument can range from      hand to lap size. With my first exposure to the thumb      piano, I found the tune maker fascinating . . . and before      long, I came up with a small, easily carried version that I      call a pocket harp. Of course, my little instrument is not      so much a "harp" as a "plunker", but it is fun to play and      it <em>can</em> be tuned to different notes, so the      homegrown musician will find it rewarding.    </p>        <p>      <strong>MAKING YOUR OWN<br /></strong><br />      To build a pocket harp like mine, you'll need the      following:<br />      <br />      Materials:<br />      <br />      small decorator tin with a lid (mine was circular and 3" in      diameter) piece of 1/ 16" aircraft plywood sized to fit      under the lid of the tin (4) 2-7/8" hair-roller bobby      pins<br />      <br />      (2) 3"lengths of coat-hanger wire section of 5132" (OD)      brass tubing, of which approximately 2" will be      required<br />      <br />      (3) No. 2-56 X 314" pan head machine screws and matching      blind mounting nuts<br />      <br />      (2) strips of box or shirt cardboard, as wide as the tin is      deep, and a bit longer than the inside circumference of the      tin<br />      <br />      <strong>Tools:</strong> A band saw or coping saw, wire      cutters, an electric drill with assorted bits, a drill      press and a 3132" bit, scissors, pliers, a ruler, a compass      (optional), a metal file, sandpaper, electrical (or      similar) tape, and several pieces of wood on which to      drill.<br />      <br />      Decorator tins come in different shapes and styles. Some      have straight sides, while others have a rolled lip around      the inside of the rim. The pocket harp's soundboard needs      to fit snug inside the tin, and if your tin has a lip,      you'll have to cut the soundboard a little smaller in order      to get past that ridge. A cardboard "sleeve" will then have      to be fitted between the sides of the tin and the      soundboard to insure a tight fit. This large inner sleeve      will be as wide as the tin is deep, and will be slightly      longer than the container's inside circumference. Inside      this sleeve is another, narrower cardboard sleeve upon      which the soundboard will rest (see the diagram).<br />      <br />      If your tin doesn't have a Tip, you'll need only the second      sleeve.This strip is about half as wide as the distance      from the tag t the bottom of the interior. Since the sound      board must snuggle down far enough inside the tin to allow      the lid to close over the tine and the clamp, I sometimes      cut the strip for the small sleeve with the midsection wide      than the ends. (This brings the free ends the tines up for      easier playing access.)<br />      <br />      To begin making the soundboard, track the outline of the      tin directly onto the air craft plywood. Cut out the shape      with band or coping saw, and use sandpaper working very      slowly-to insure that the piece fits snug inside the tin.      The plywood will be the kalimba's soundboard . . . an some      sort of shape-a circle, star, or other design-must be      drawn, drilled, then cu out of its center or far edge to      serve as sound hole. Once the top is shaped and the sound      hole is made, set the piece asid while you work on the      other elements.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE TINE ASSEMBLY<br /></strong><br />      The harp tines-sections from long bobb pins-rest on top of      two wire supports. These are all clamped in place by a      section of brass tubing that is bolted on top of the whole      assembly (see the diagram). The wire supports are simply      two 3" lengths of coat hanger wire, each bent (with pliers)      into right-angled 2"bracket or "staple" wit a 1/2"      legs.<br />      <br />      These legs drop through small holes in the soundboard,      allowing the 2" portion to lie flat against the top. The      sup<br />      ports should be parallel and about 5/6 inch apart, so after      you've bent the legs, mark the points where the holes      should be on the soundboard and then drill them (a 3/32"      bit should do the job).<br />      <br />      The harp tines will vary in number depending on the size of      your instrument. I used 8 in my 3" circular tin kalimba,      and cut them from 2-7/8" bobby pins, the largest tine      measuring half of one pin. Each succeeding tine is 1/8 inch      shorter than the one before. I always make sure that the      free ends of the tines turn up, bending them with pliers if      necessary. When using a circular tin, I position the tines      with the longest in the center and the shortest ones on the      ends (this is the most common arrangement in mbiras). On a      rectangular model, however, I lay them out from longest to      shortest, left to right.<br />      <br />      A clamp made from thin brass tubing holds the tines in      place. To be sure that everything lines up correctly, you      should use a drill press with a 3/32" bit to make the holes      in the tubing and the soundboard. First, score a deep      groove in a piece of scrap wood to hold the length of      brass. Next, tape the tube in place at both ends so it      won't twirl in the groove. Mark three holes on the tubing,      keeping them 314 inch apart . . .<br />      dent the marks lightly with a nail set or a nail . . . then      drill the holes with the 3/32" bit. Cut the tubing off at a      point 114 inch from each of the two end holes, making a 2"      piece. Any rough or sharp edges on the<br />      tines or brass tubing should now be smoothed with a metal      file.<br />      <br />      To position the clamp's holes on the soundboard, first drop      the wire supports in place . . . center the drilled brass      tube between the supports . . . and stick a pencil through      the holes to mark the plywood.<br />      <br />      Then simply drill where indicated. These bores, by the way,      will have to be a shade larger than those in the tubing      because the blind mounting nuts are larder than the screws.      (It's easy to enlarge the holes a bit by gently inserting      and twirling the end of a nail, awl, or Phillips      screwdriver.) With the wire supports in place, lay the      brass tube between them, insert the machine screws through      both the tubing and the soundboard, and loosely attach the      blind nuts. Next, push the tines between the supports and      the tube and tighten the<br />      screws just enough to hold them in place.<br />      <br />      At this point, fiddle around with the tines, sliding them      in and out, trying one length and another until you're      satisfied with their arrangement. When that's done, tighten      the assembly until the tines are held firmly. To rechange      their pitch, simply loosen the screws just enough to be      able to slide the tines in or out. (The shorter their      length, the higher their sound.) With the soundboard      completed and the cardboard sleeves) in place, you can fit      the soundboard inside the tin. It may be difficult to get      it past the wider sleeve: A piece of thin plastic-such as      that from a sand-with bag-laid between the wood and the      sleeve will help to "shoehorn" the plywood inside. (Pull      the plastic out afterward.)The pocket harp's easy      portability, cheerful twang, and pleasant tone make it a      good . . . one that lovers of home-grown music will enjoy a      great deal.    </p>
