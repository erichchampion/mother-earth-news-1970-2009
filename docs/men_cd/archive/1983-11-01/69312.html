                    <p>      <em>Our mini-tractor's first implement will work with any      Category 0 tractor hitch!</em><br />      <br />      Just last year, in MOTHER NO. 78 (on page 172), we      completed a three-part feature article about a sturdy home      built mini tractor that our research crew put together for      about half the price of the factory-made offerings. The      photos included in that piece depicted a handy little      Category 0 scrape blade that, if you remember, we promised      to detail in a future issue . . . and, with the winter      season upon us, we thought that now would be a perfect time      to describe the construction of that particularly versatile      implement.    </p>            <p>      The heart of our budget blade is nothing more than a 12" X      48" section cut from the wall of a discarded water-heater      tank. With its fairly heavy-gauge material and ideal      contour, it provides an excellent starting point, but be      aware that-unless you can locate a 66- or 82gallon      "highboy"-style tank (these models have a diameter of at      least 20", and a length of 48" or more)-you'll have to cut      two sections from a short, squat tank (30-, 40-, or      52-gallon capacity), and then weld them together to achieve      the desired dimensions. Keep in mind, too, that      <em>galvanized</em> vessels give off harmful fumes when      welded, so you may want to limit your search to standard      black steel tanks.<br />      <br />      To prevent the blade from flexing under stress, you'll need      to weld stiffeners to its back to form a perimetric      framework. The horizontal ones are 45-1/2" long, and can be      made from 1/4" X 1" angle iron. The vertical braces-which      have to assume the curve of the tank-can be either cut from      1/4" plate or formed (with heat) from 1/4" X 1-1/4" X 12"      flat stock.<br />      <br />      Once all that's done, you can tackle the blade's main      frame. It consists of an 11 gauge rectangular tubular steel      base (measuring 1-5/8" X 4" X 21-1/2") that's fastened at      right angles to a 1-5/8" X 4" X 18-1/4" arm made of the      same material. Of course, if you have stock of another size      lying around, use it . . . because a substantial piece of      square, round, or even channel steel will work just as      well.    </p>        <p>      On the upper surface of the main frame we've installed a      top link wishbone formed from a 27" length of      1-3/4"-diameter tubing. The crown of this hoop-shaped      hanger should be about 10 inches above the base beam, and a      pair of 1/4" X 1-1/2" X 2-1/2" top link pin brackets must      be welded above this. (To position them correctly, use the      rod end joint on the top link as a drilling and spacing      guide). Although <em>we</em> employed a section of      preformed roll bar when building this wishbone, muffler      tubing or 1/2" flat bar stock-bent to shape could serve the      same purpose.<br />      <br />      The ends of the main frame are capped with 1/4" X 1-1/2" X      4" plates . . . but, before beading them in place, you'll      have to center drill them with a 5/8" bit and weld the 5/8"      X 3" hitch pins from the back side. A third, undrilled,      plate covers the front end of the frame's arm.<br />      <br />      Like any conventional scraping blade, ours is designed to      pivot on both a horizontal and a vertical plane to execute      various kinds of cuts. Start fabricating the horizontal      pivot by cutting the three 1/2" X 6" swivel-bracket      sections to 1", 2", and 4" widths as shown in the diagram      (J, K, and L). Clamp the 2" and 4" pieces together and      drill the three 1/2" locking pin holes (1-1/2 inches apart      and on a 2-1/4" radius), then use a 1-1/2" hole saw to bore      another opening (it must be centered over that axis).<br />      <br />      At this point, you can make up the horizontal pivot shaft      by grinding and drilling a 1-1/2" X 5-1/2" cold-rolled rod      . . . forming a 45Â° I/2"-deep bevel at one end and a      1/4" hole through the other. Weld the beveled end of this      shaft to the 1/2" X 4" X 6" swivel bracket section (the      "slice" offers an increased surface area to assure a strong      joint), and fasten that piece to the rear of the blade      frame's arm.<br />      <br />      You'll now need to fabricate two 112" X 8" round steel      disks (for the vertical pivot) and a 1/2" X 5-1/2" disk to      serve as the horizontal pivot plate. The 5-112"-diameter      component should be given a 1-I/2" center hole, and then a      1-I/2" X 3-3/8" section of pipe-the horizontal pivot      collar-must be aligned and welded over the opening. Next,      bevel and drill the 1-1/2" X 11" vertical pivot shaft just      as you did the horizontal pinion, and attach it      perpendicularly to the horizontal pivot collar, taking care      not to extend the bead any farther down the rod than is      necessary to fill the joint.<br />      <br />      The lower half of the vertical swivel bracket can now be      formed from a 1/2" X 21I2" X 6-1/2" section of flat plate.      When that's done, the steel crescent can be clamped to one      of the 1/2" X 8" disks you made previously, and three 1/2"      holes can be drilled through both pieces-spaced 1-3/4"      apart-near the edge. Then separate the pieces . . . drill a      1-1I2" bore through the center of the full circle . . .      weld the I-1/2" X 2" vertical bracket collar over that hole      . . . slip this assembly over the vertical pivot shaft and      join both pipe collars together at their union . . . and go      on to weld the collars <em>and</em> the internal shaft      together as one, using a full, penetrating bead.<br />      <br />      Next, lift the entire assembly and slide it onto the      horizontal pivot shaft, and lock it in place with a flat      washer and a cotter pin. . (This washer, as well as the one      you'll later use on the vertical shaft, can be made from      1/4" plate and center-bored with a 1-112" metal cutting      hole saw.)<br />      <br />      Now, you're ready to finish up the horizontal swivel      bracket by fastening the back and the top pieces to the      1/2" X 4" X 6" component, thereby forming a housing around      the horizontal pivot plate. That semicircular unit can then      be drilled-using the holes already in the bracket as a      guide allowing the blade to be set at a number of      horizontal angles. (Start by making the initial 1/2" hole      that will position the scraper at dead level . . . then, to      the right and left of that, make two more receivers 3/4      inch away, and drill the last two openings at points 3116      inch from the second two.)<br />      <br />      The vertical swivel bracket is made in much the same way.      First, bore a 1-1/2" opening in the center of your last      8"diameter disk, then weld the 1-1/2" X 7" pipe over that      hole. Slide this collar-and plate assembly onto the      vertical pivot shaft, and hold it with the flat washer and      a cotter pin, ac before<br />      <br />      With that done, form the curved part of the vertical      bracket from a 1/2" X 1" X 8" flat plate (which should      match the contour of an 8 "diameter circle), and weld it to      both the crescent-shaped piece you cut earlier and the 1/2"      X 8"-round vertical bracket component already fastened to      the collar . . . with the 1/2" X 8" vertical pivot plate      between. Once more, drill a series of 1/2" holes through      the pivot plate so that the blade can be angled . . . but      this time <em>repeat</em> the set, positioning these end      series directly opposite your first group so that the scrap      er can be completely turned around if necessary.<br />      <br />      To attach the blade to the frame, you'll first have to      hitch that carriage to the rear of your tractor, using the      side pins and the top link as you would normally. Level the      frame, then lay the blade in position against the vertical      pivot collar with the bottom edge forward of the top one      (assuming, naturally, that the concave surface is toward      the front). Now, make a cardboard template of the two      blade-fastening gussets to make sure that the contours are      correct, transfer the pattern to 1/4" plate steel, and cut      out the parts. Weld them between the collar and the upper      half of the blade . . . and your implement is      complete!<br />      <br />      Of course, you'll need to make two locking pins from 1/2" X      2" bolts (bent sections of 1/4" rod welded to the heads      make nice handles), and you'll probably want to paint the      blade and frame. Other than that,though, the only addition      you might consider is a I/4" X 2" X 48" face bar, to save      the water tank skin's cutting edge from excessive wear      under rough conditions.    </p>
