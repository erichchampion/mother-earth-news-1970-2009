                <p>      <strong>MEDICAL SELF-CARE</strong>    </p>            <p>      <em>This issue's column was guest--written--for Dr. Tom      Ferguson-by a frequent contributor to</em> Medical      Self-Care.</p>      <h5 id="byline">by Bobbie Hasselbring</h5>      <p>      If someone promised to pay you $500 to stay healthy next      year, do you think you might try a little harder than you      do now to promote your own well-being?<br />      <br />      Well, that's certainly been the case with several thousand      people across the country whose employers have adopted      "stay-well health insurance": an incentive program that      pays cold cash (or other benefits) to workers who remain      <em>in</em> good health and <em>out</em> of the doctor's      office.<br />      <br />      The concept was born in 1978 in northern California's      Mendocino County, when Assistant School Superintendent Ed      Nickerman was asked to find ways to help the school system      cut costs. His investigation soon uncovered a particularly      burdensome expense for both the district and its employees      (including himself): health insurance.<br />      <br />      "I have a large family," says Nickerman, "and no matter      what I did, our health insurance premiums kept going up.      Yet the only times we benefited from those payments were      when one of us got sick. There was never any reward for      staying well."<br />      <br />      Ed reasoned that people would adopt more healthful      lifestyles if they were offered some kind of financial      incentive . . . and he reckoned further that, as their      health improved as a result, they would use fewer medical      services, which in turn would ultimately lower the school's      (and its employees') insurance premiums.<br />      <br />      At that time, Mendocino's schools carried a zero-deductible      health insurance plan. Nickerman calculated, however, that      if the district converted to a -$500-deductible plan, and      set aside $500 per employee in a separate account to be      used for the worker's medical expenses under $500 (anything      over that amount, of course, would be paid by the insurer),      the system could still provide total health coverage . . .      but for a lower cost.<br />      <br />      <strong>DOUBLE INCENTIVE</strong><br />      <br />      The "reward" part of Nickerman's plan was twofold: First,      the district would earn interest on the money banked to      cover each worker's first $500 in medical costs. And      second, each employee would be credited with any of the      money that he or she didn't use . . . and the amount      accumulated over the years could be redeemed when that      person retired or left the district.<br />      <br />      If, for example, an employee's medical expenses totaled      $100 for a given year, the district would pay that sum and      credit the person with a stay-well bonus of $400. If the      employee spent an average of just $100 a year in medical      expenses for 20 years, he or she would collect a stay-well      retirement bonus of $8,000!<br />      <br />      Although his proposal was turned down by six other      carriers, Nickerman managed to convince Blue Shield to      underwrite the novel plan . . . and today, all parties      involved are pleased with the results.<br />      <br />      After just three years of the program, the district has      saved $250,000 in insurance premiums . . . has stabilized      its insurance costs . . . and has earned more than $20,000      in interest on the funds set aside to cover the      deductibles. In addition, many employees have begun to      accumulate substantial retirement nest eggs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A NEW SCHOOL BUS</strong> <strong>. . . AND      MORE</strong><br />      <br />      One of the reasons behind the stay-well plan's success is      that only a fraction of the subscribers actually use $500      worth of medical services each year. In fact, during the      initial two years of the program, 25% of Mendocino school      employees incurred no medical expenses at all! The district      had banked about $90,000 to fund stay-well's first year,      and after covering <em>all</em> employee health costs, it      had $37,000 left. The following year, the surplus amounted      to $36,000. And most important, those dollars accrue      considerable interest for the school system . . . it's      estimated, in fact, that the district can expect an      interest income of more than $500,000 over the next ten      years. Already, Mendocino County can boast of a shiny new      school bus purchased with stay well earnings, and can      confidently look forward to meeting other such needs with      the "free" money.<br />      <br />      Meanwhile, many school employees can anticipate fuller, and      probably longer, lives . . . because the stay-well plan has      motivated them to take more interest in maintaining their      health. Soon after the program's introduction, district      employees converted an empty storage area into an exercise      room and equipped it themselves. Many workers have quit      smoking, improved their diets, and started exercising      regularly.<br />      <br />      In addition, the plan has improved the relationship between      the school district and its insurance company . . . the two      now work together to promote the concept of self-care, and      both reap the benefits of lower costs as a result. District      and Blue Shield officials conduct an ongoing educational      campaign for school employees. And each worker gets a free      annual physical checkup, which saves everyone money in the      long run by detecting health problems in the early, most      treatable, stages.<br />      <br />      <strong>VARIATIONS ON THE</strong> <strong>STAY-WELL      THEME</strong><br />      <br />      Not all stay-well programs work precisely like the      Mendocino plan. In southern California's Capistrano school      system, for ex ample, each employee receives the unspent      portion of his or her $500 deductible fund as a year-end      bonus. The Bank of America recently launched a pilot      program in which employees do pay a portion of their      insurance premiums, but if they incur medical expenses of      less than $100 each year (or under $250 per family), they      become eligible for <em>free</em> coverage the following      year. And in Louisiana, the state branch of the American      Medical Association has a plan that invests members'      stay-well bonuses in individual retirement accounts.<br />      <br />      <strong>AN IDEA WHOSE</strong> <strong>TIME IS      OVERDUE</strong><br />      <br />      Twenty years ago, the cost of being hospitalized in      California was about $42 a day . . . today, it averages      from $400 to $800 per diem. In 1960, the typical hospital      stay cost $305 . . . today it amounts to $2,475, an      increase of 800%. During the same period, the fee for a      visit to the doctor's office increased 230% ...      prescription drug prices rose 89% . . . and health      insurance premiums went up a whopping 410%.<br />      <br />      Significantly, Blue Shield officials blame the increases      not only on inflation and the high cost of      ever-more-sophisticated technologies, but also on simple      <em>over utilization</em> of health-care services. They      estimate that 50% to 70% of all visits to physicians are      unnecessary! Colds, flu, upset stomachs, and a myriad of      other common complaints could be treated more effectively,      and far less expensively, at home. But despite attempts to      encourage more appropriate use of health services, there      seemed to be no way to stop the trend toward needless      doctor visits, soaring health-care costs, and rising      insurance premiums . . . until the stay well concept came      along.<br />      <br />      But, of course, not everyone has embraced the idea with      open arms. Many employers remain unconvinced that such a      program really <em>can</em> reduce their annual costs and      some insurance companies fear that stay-well plans-since      they raise deductibles and reduce direct premiums-will cut      into their incomes. But Blue Shield's experience has proved      otherwise: Employers interested in the idea have brought      new business to the company. And, according to Blue      Shield's Gus Barlas, the firm is confident that stay-well      plans will ultimately help control increasing pay-out      costs. "In the long run," says Barlas, <em>"everyone</em>      is going to save money with healthier employees."<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Medical Self-Care, <em>Dr. Tom      Ferguson's quarterly journal, is available for $15 per year      from Medical Self Care, Dept.
