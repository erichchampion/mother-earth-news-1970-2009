                <p>      <em>Don't discard your worn-out woolens! Let them warm you      twice, by turning them into . . .</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Susan Dart</h5>        <p>      We all know that wool is wonderfully warm . . . but many of      you may be surprised to learn that a pretty coverlet made      of this natural fiber is a luxury that anyone with access      to a sewing machine can afford! In fact, except for the      backing material (which I found on sale), I didn't spend a      cent on <em>any</em> of the colorful patchwork pieces shown      in the accompanying photographs. All the material used in      my creations was salvaged from old clothes or sewing scraps      . . . and I even used thread left over from other projects      to assemble the components.<br />      <br />      Actually, I was downright astonished by how quickly I was      able to collect enough usable woolen material to make a      coverlet. People are usually so glad to have their castoffs      put to good use that they thank me for taking them! Folks      who make their own clothes are also great potential sources      of cloth scraps. (I once got nearly a yard of brand-new      woolen material from a friend who had misjudged how much      she needed to make a dress.) Don't overlook men's clothing      shops, either. A lot of fitters throw out perfectly good      material cut during the alteration process, and I've      sometimes come across pieces as wide as six inches.<br />      <br />      <strong>WASH THE WOOL</strong><br />      <br />      Before you begin to put a coverlet together, wash all your      material-both old and new-in cold water, with a soap      recommended for laundering wool. (This cleaning should take      care of any shrinkage that might otherwise occur the first      time you wash your finished product.) In addition, be sure      to cut around any moth holes or weak spots in used      material. These can be found easily by holding the fabric      up to the light.<br />      <br />      I'd suggest that you avoid using knits, since they can be      difficult to handle in sewing and will sometimes run.      Blends of wool and synthetics are acceptable, but      100Â°10 synthetics aren't as warm as wool and are      sometimes troublesome to work with and care for.<br />      <br />      It's also wise to press all of your cloth before you begin,      and to do so again after each step in the assembly process,      using a steam iron or a damp cloth with a regular iron.      Don't press all the seams <em>open</em> . . . just iron      them so they all face in one direction (such seams are      stronger than the open variety). Finally, since various      weaves will stretch in different ways, don't knock yourself      out trying to make each seam perfect. You'll find that      irregularities actually add to the coverlet's charm.    </p>        <p>      <strong>FAST VERSUS FANCY</strong><br />      <br />      I use two methods when making my quick-and-comfy covers.      The first technique doesn't require much advance planning .      . . in fact, you can produce a multicolored coverlet (like      the blue-bordered one pictured in the photo) simply by      piecing together a bunch of sections and then deciding      later what to do with them. Since you'll sew the backing on      last, you could even change your mind and turn your      patchwork efforts into a cozy shawl, a quaint pillow, or a      warm skirt.<br />      <br />      To tackle this "simplified" project, begin by sewing the      sides of two squares or rectangles (A and B) together as      shown in Fig. 1. Then stitch another piece-or several put      together patches (C)-across the bottom of the first two . .      . press the seam . . . and continue adding patches until      the section reaches the size and shape you want. Next, go      on to start a new section, adding it to the first in the      same manner in which you assembled the patches: Just sew      them together . . . press the seam . . . and continue      piecing until the coverlet's top is complete.<br />      <br />      To put on the backing, sew together (or cut, as the case      may be) a section of material that's the same size as the      front patchwork piece. Then position those two parts with      their right sides together, and stitch along three      sides.<br />      <br />      Now, turn your project right side out . . . press the seams      . . . turn in the raw edges on the fourth side . . . and      finish sewing by hand (or, if you prefer, topstitch the      border on the machine). Then, if you like, you can run a      machine stitch around the entire coverlet at a point about      two inches in from the edge. (It's also a good idea to use      scrap yarn to tuft the backing to the top cover, in order      to prevent the two sides from sagging or pulling away from      each other.)<br />      <br />      That's my <em>fast</em> method. If, however, you'd prefer      your coverlet to have more of a <em>quilted</em> look about      it, you'll have to use the "fancy" method . . . which takes      a bit longer, but is well worth the effort. To begin,      decide what size you want the finished cover to be, and cut      your <em>backing</em> material into squares or rectangles      that will-when pieced together-equal the desired      dimensions. (I've found that pieces 15" to 30" on a side      are easiest to work with.)<br />      <br />      Next-as illustrated in Fig <strong>.</strong> 2-pin one of      your wool patches (X) approximately in the center of the      larger square of backing, making sure that wrong sides are      together. Put<br />      <br />      another woolen patch (Y) over one edge of Patch X      <em>(right</em> sides together this time) . . . sew it      along one edge, all the way through Patch X and the backing      . . . and iron the material flat.<br />      <br />      Now, attach a patch or several patches already put together      (Z), whose length equals the long edge of X and Y . . .      sewing in such a way that the seam runs through Z, X, Y,      <em>and</em> the backing, as indicated in Fig. 3. Press the      seam . . . and continue adding patchwork pieces to the raw      edges until the entire unit is covered, leaving only the      outside edges unsewn (Fig. 4). This will allow for material      to be flapped back when the separate units are hitched      together.<br />      <br />      After you've quilted all your large backing squares      individually in this manner, it's time to put two of those      units together, patchwork sides touching. Join them by      folding back the unsewn inch on the backing of the first      unit and sewing the remaining three layers together on one      edge, using a 112" to 518" seam and leaving one inch free      at either end of the seam (Fig. 5). Then iron your newest      seam flat . . . push it upward . . . tuck in the backing      fold . . . and stitch by hand as illustrated in Fig. 6.      Continue sewing the units together until you have several      long strips, then stitch those strips together in the same      manner, until your coverlet is completed. (If necessary,      trim the outer edges to straighten them.)<br />      <br />      As a final step, you'll want to bind the coverlet's      borders. So cut strips the length of each side . . . adding      enough allowance to miter the corners (Figs. 7 and 8).      These pieces can be any width you feel is appropriate.      Simply sew the strips along the outside edges with the      right sides together . . . press the seams . . . fold the      strips over . . . tuck under the raw edges of the backing      seams . . . and sew by hand. To miter the corners, fold the      ends of the strips diagonally and tuck in the excess, then      slip-stitch them in place.    </p>    			<p>      <strong>Joan Lindeman</strong><br />      <br />      <em>As energy costs rise, more and more people have turned      to goose down quilts for wintertime comfort. Unfortunately,      many</em> of <em>us who</em> need <em>to worry about the      expense</em> of <em>turning up the thermostat simply can't      afford that luxury (such a quilt costs anywhere from $100      to more than $600, depending on its size, the quality of      the filling, and the particular sales outlet marketing it),      even if it's available in a do-it-yourself kit.</em><br />      <br />      <em>I faced this problem not long ago, and searching for a      solution-1 turned to flannel. Cozy, cuddly, soft cotton      flannel sheets, shirts, and gowns have kept generations of      folks toasty warm through many a freezing season, so (1      reasoned) a quilt that was topped and backed with that      cloth would certainly be effective in keeping out the      cold-weather chills. The inspiration drove me to my scrap      bag, my neighbors,</em> <em>and finally, to local fabric      shops in search of surplus material.</em><br />      <br />      <em>My plan, you see, was to make a piecework quilt of      flannel . . . rather than the usual cotton muslin or      broadcloth. The material 1 gathered came mainly from      friends who make infant and toddler clothes, pajamas,      nightgowns, and shirts . . . but remnant bins in fabric      shops did provide me with pieces that 1 was able to use      to</em> fill <em>in the patterns and carry out the color      scheme of my design.</em> Of <em>course,</em> if <em>1      hadn't been able to find such giveaways, I could still have      finished my project . . . because new flannel is      inexpensive enough to allow a thrifty seamstress or      seamster to make a comforter from whole cloth.</em><br />      <br />      <strong>SELECTING A PATTERN</strong><br />      <br />      <em>Because of the fine nap typical of flannel, I chose      quilt patterns composed of large, bold design elements      rather than small and intricate pieces. Perhaps the</em>      <em>simplest approach of all would have been to sew a      comforter with a printed (or plain) flannel tap, a plain      backing, and a layer</em> of <em>batting between, all      border-stitched and held together with yarn ties every      4-1/2 inches. If you're inexperienced but still would      prefer to make a piecework quilt instead of a simple      comforter, just sew a patchwork of 4-1/2" squares. Stitch      the quadrangles together into nine-patch sections (three      rows</em> of <em>three patches each)</em> that-allowing      <em>for 1/2" seams-will measure 12" on each side. Sew these      large squares together into rows until you have a quilt of      the size you desire.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Flannel can be used in traditional patterns, too, as      the accompanying photo of the "Flower Basket" quilt      illustrates.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Washable, versatile, warm, and soft, this cotton is a      lovely fabric. Let it help make your winter a cozy one . .      . and when it comes to comfort, why not reach for      flannel!</em>    </p>
