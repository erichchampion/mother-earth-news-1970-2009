        [1] Grapevines are easier to shape if used immediately after they are collected. Start your wreath by looping the vines in a circle. [2] The finished garland can be sold, given as a special remembrance, or kept for your own home. [3] The more wreaths you make, the easier you'll find them to create. [4] You can adorn your vines with colorful ribbons and bows (or anything else that strikes your fancy!).
