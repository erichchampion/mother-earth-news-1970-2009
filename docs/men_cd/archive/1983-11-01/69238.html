                <p>      This holiday centerpiece-made from squash, seeds, and      such-is certainly . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Juanita Browne    </h5>    <p>      Juanita Browne What could be a more appropriate decoration      for Thanksgiving than a turkey centerpiece made from the      fruits of a fall harvest! In fact, variations of this      golden bird which is both delightful and easy to create      grace and brighten our holiday table each year.<br />      <br />      The gobbler's head consists of a mature crookneck squash      with a portion of the stem left on to serve as a beak. It's      often necessary to cut off a bit of the squash's bottom so      it'll stand upright and not be toppled by dinner time table      wobbles. (If you do this, be sure to place the head on a      small piece of cardboard to protect your table's      finish.)<br />      <br />      Next, add a small pumpkin (it'll be the bird's body),      connecting it to the head with a long, thin nail. Two more      nails are then used to attach the patty pan squash that      forms the tail.<br />      <br />      The fan feathers consist of two dozen corn husks that have      been soaked in water for 30 minutes to make them pliable.      Simply shake off the excess liquid and roll a dozen of the      shucks into large, loose curls, wrapping each one with a      rubber band.<br />      <br />      Then, turning to the other husks, cut a dozen rounded petal      shapes . . . and use straight pins to attach them in a      circle around the outer edges of the patty pan tail.    </p>    			<p>      Later, when the shuck curls are dry, remove the rubber      bands and pin <em>these</em> feathers in a symmetrical      pattern on the center of the tail.<br />      <br />      To fashion your fowl's snood and wattle, simply pin one      long pepper on the top of the head, and another along the      underside of the gobbler's neck.<br />      <br />      Finally, affix large seedpods to serve as the turkey's      eyes, and use dried bracken fern (or any similar material)      to make its wings and additional feathers.<br />      <br />      This big, beautiful bird will delight your dinner guests .      . . and, after the feast is over, it can form the basis for      some lighter-and strictly vegetarian-meals!    </p>
