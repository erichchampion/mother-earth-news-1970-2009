                        <h3>      Here's traditional Christmas toy that you needn't spend a      mint on.    </h3>    <p>      If the idea of a sturdy homebuilt sled strikes your fancy      (and it well might, considering the prices of today's brand      name models), you may want to take a close look at the snow      scooter that MOTHER's woodshop "elves" pieced together for      the holiday season. Believe it or not, this attractive      white-oak-and-steel slider was built largely from odds and      ends . . . but it works just as well as the "benchmark"      models that are the envy of every kid on the hill. In fact,      its <em>maneuverability</em> may even be superior because      of the unique isolated steering design!    </p>            <p>      Before your skepticism gets the better of you, we'll have      to let you in on one of the secrets behind the cutter's      high quality and low cost: Every bit of wood in this sled      was salvaged-free-from a discarded oak freight pallet. Now      it's true that the older hardwood shipping skids are a bit      difficult to find these days, but some <em>are</em> still      around . . . at warehouse loading docks, manufacturing and      printing plants, behind "chain" retail stores, or even in      the local dump. Seek, and (with luck) ye shall find.<br />      <br />      At any rate, if you <em>can</em> locate a hardwood pallet      in good shape for a reasonable cost (or for free), half the      battle is won. To prepare it for recycling, carefully      remove its fluted nailseither by unscrewing them with a      pair of ViseGrips or by hammering the decking planks so      they separate from the three larger stringers, thus      exposing the fasteners-and then free the boards of any      staples, strapping, or what have you that might still be      attached. (Try not to split the wood as you work with it,      or you'll end up searching for a second pallet to make up      for breakage.)<br />      <br />      <strong>CUT AND TRIM</strong><br />      <br />      With the lumber laid out, you're ready to determine which      pieces to use for the various components. The organic      portion of the sled is made up of several parts:<br />      <br />      [1] the lengthwise frame, consisting of two 1-1/4" X 1-1/4"      X 61/2" pieces, two 1-1/4" X 1-7/8" X 31" sections, and one      1/2" X 1-1/4" X 25" central spine,<br />      <br />      [2] the cross braces . . . three 1/2" X 11/4" X 12"      ribs,<br />      <br />      [3] the decking, made of one 1/4" X 3-1/4" X 38-1/2" plank      and two 1/4" X 2-1/2" X 36" tongues,<br />      <br />      [4] the handlebar, simply a 3/4" X 3-1/2" X 23" board (to      be formed to the desired shape), and<br />      <br />      [5] the nosepiece, a 1/2" X 1-1/4" X 12-3/4" strip.<br />      <br />      Since not all pallets are constructed in the same way, we      can't tell you <em>exactly</em> which part of a skid to use      for each sled component, but common sense should be your      guide: If a hunk of salvaged wood looks as if it might      yield the handlebar, the three cross braces, and the      nosepiece, then go for it!<br />      <br />      If you'll notice, every piece of wood in the cariole has      formed or rounded edges, which can be duplicated with a      coping saw.<br />      <br />      We should point out, though, that we've specified 1/4"      material-stock that's not found in most pallets-for the      sled's decking. The strips can be made by planing down the      thicker boards (which is what we did), or-to save a bit of      work-the 1/2" to 3/4" planks can be used as is. By the same      token, the longer frame sections-which are a full 1-7/8"      highcan be either cut from a 2"-wide board (a relatively      easy process) or "blocked" by gluing 3/4" X 1-1/4" X 2-3/8"      spacers to these rails where they require width and then      contouring them (a tech nique that we quickly learned is      <em>not</em> particularly easy).    </p>    <p>      Once you've decided on the stock to use, outline on the raw      billet, in pencil, the shapes of the parts you need, and      then cut them . . . first to length, next to width, and      then-if you wish-to thickness. Obviously, a table saw can      be a boon to this project, but a circular saw-or even just      a pair of sharp handsaws (one rip, and one crosscut)would      do in a pinch. When cutting, keep a sharp lookout for any      buried nails . . . and try not to position a large nail      hole or knot in any structural member.    </p>    <p>      Finally, use a jig or coping saw to round of the ends of      the components and-on the appropriate pieces-to contour the      surfaces.<br />      <br />      <strong>RODS AND RUNNERS</strong><br />      <br />      When you've cut your wood to size and shaped it as best you      can to duplicate what you see in the illustration and      photos, you can start working on the sled's metal      parts.<br />      <br />      The runners are, like the frame, a two part proposition.      The main section (at the rear) consists simply of a pair of      1/2" electrical metallic tubes (E.M.T.), each 31-3/4" in      length and curved to a 45 ° angle on what will be the      forward end. You can make these curves with a conduit      bender or by carefully bending them around a post. About 2"      of straight stub should protrude ahead of the arc when      everything's done. The front, or steerable, section is made      of the same material, but each runner is 16-1/2" long with      2-1/2" of straight stub .. . and is equipped on its bottom      edge with an 11-1/2" skeg made from 1/4" reinforcing      rod.<br />      <br />      To install each of these metal guides, you'll have to cut      threads into one end with a 1/420 die, bend a small hook in      the other end, form the rod to the curve of the runner, and      put a 90 ° crook in the threaded end so it'll pass      trough the rear of the tubes and accept a 1/4" nut. Once      this is done, you can drill 9/32" holes into the conduit at      the points where the hooks and the threaded stubs will      penetrate (keeping in mind that the former elements have to      pierce only one wall of the runners' tubing). Then twist,      slip, and fasten the skegs in place.<br />      <br />      The next task is to <em>mount</em> the runners to their      respective wooden frame rails. We did this using two pairs      of galvanized wrought steel door pulls having a      center-to-center hole measure of 5-3/8" and a projection o      1-1/4". For the main (rear) skids, it's easier to first      drill a 3/4" hole (about 1/2" deep) into the forward end of      each main side rail at a 45 ° angle-leaving enough of      the rail's tip to accept a fastening bolt that you'll      install later and then slip the front of each runner into      place. Now, position the door handle mounts toward the      rear, so that the pull holes are centered over the      stanchions the frame rails (see the diagram) . . . mark the      wood for drilling . . . and lock the handles to the conduit      with a few pop rivets (o <em>braze</em> the parts together,      making<br />      sure that you do so in a well-ventilated area).<br />      <br />      The front runners are similarly fastened only in this case      they mount to the handles just forward of the midpoint      between the straight end of the tubes and their bows . . .      and the handles, in turn, are simply bolted to the      6-1/2"-long forward frame rails. The runners' front tips      are housed in 1/4" deep, 3/4" sockets drilled into the      nosepiece on an I 1 " center: The bumper board can be      locked to the conduit either with a good epoxy glue or with      short 1/4" roundhead bolts threaded into nuts brazed within      the tips of the tubes.    </p>    <h3>      A PERFECT FIT    </h3>    <p>      From here on in, it's just a matter of bolting and nailing      the wooden parts together. The handlebar should be mounted      square to the front runner assembly (the tubes lf must be      precisely parallel) with 1/4" X 2" carriage bolts, and      5/16" rope holes should be drilled and countersunk in the      center of each grip.<br />      <br />      The three cross braces can now be bolted atop the main side      rails . . . one at each end, and the third 18 inches behind      the front one. Next, the three decking strips can be tacked      in place with 5/8" 18-gauge wire nails. The widest tongue      goes in the center, with 6" of it extending forward of the      front cross brace, and the other two are placed on either      side of the main plank (allow 5/8 inch between slats), with      4" protruding.<br />      <br />      At this point, you'll want to fasten the steering carriage      to the main body. To do this, lay both sections upside down      on a flat surface and position the handlebar beneath the      forward end of the center deck plank so its midpoint is      1-1/2 inches behind that strip's rounded front edge, and so      that the fore and aft runners are in line. Then drill a      1/4" hole at that midpoint through the two pieces of wood .      . . and another through the 25 "-long central spine bar      (the only piece of loose wood remaining) about 1 inch from      one of its ends. Place the spine against the underneath      surfaces of the handlebar and the two foremost cross      braces, and lock the handlebar, spine, and center decking      plank together with a 1/4" X 2" carriage bolt. (This      steering pivot pin will function much more smoothly if you      cut 1 "-diameter circles from the sides of a plastic milk      jug, bore their centers, and slip the pads between the      handlebar and the wood above and below it.) Two more      bolts-each placed between the remaining junctions of the      spine, cross braces, and center plank-will complete your      sled's assembly.<br />      <br />      Of course, you'll no doubt want to <em>protect</em> the oak      from the effects of snow with a coat or two of shellac or      polyurethane . . . and you'll need to thread and tie your      steering rope to the handles. But once that's done, you can      hit the slopes with a vengeance . . . or simply enjoy a      leisurely pull along a well packed (and sparsely traveled)      country lane. And by the way, don't forget to bring along      your runner wax!</p>   <h3>TRY IT ON A SMALLER SCALE</h3>			<p>      There's nothing like bounding down a snowy slope on a good      of runner sled to fill a kid's winter afternoon. Sometimes,      however, while the children old enough to look after      themselves are having a grand time, their younger siblings      are "grounded" indoors, brooding over the big kids' new      plaything with something akin to jealousy.    </p>        <p>      Well, it's easy enough to avoid that scenario: If you're      building the skid sled anyway, you might as well go the      extra mile and whip up this pint-sized replica while you're      at it. It's made from salvaged wood as is the larger toy,      but-instead of employing runners-it rolls on four furniture      casters that allow a toddler to pull the sled along the      floor or carpet . . . which can be big-time fun for someone      who's just learning to get around!<br />      <br />      To build it, follow the basic guidelines given for the snow      sled. They boil down to [1] choosing the parts of the      shipping pallet that are necessary to make the individual      components called for in our illustration, [2] planing and      cutting those pieces to match our given dimensions, and [3]      shaping and sanding them to render a smooth, finished look.      As is the case with this model's big brother, the use of      power tools will make your woodworking chores a good deal      easier . . . but the job can be done with handsaws, a bench      plane, a coping saw, and a sanding block (if you don't mind      using a bit of elbow grease).<br />      <br />      Assembling the little carpet scooter ought to take only a      short time (once you've made the pieces) . . . if you refer      to the diagram. All of the wood joints should first be      bonded with carpenter's glue, then as each one is      made-secured with 5/8" 18gauge wire nails.    </p>        <p>      (The side rails will require a larger, 1 ", nail.) Put the      frame together by laying the three cross braces      down-parallel and about 5-1/4 inches apart-on a work      surface and then attaching the two side rails to the      boards' ends. Next, the three deck planks are fastened      (positioned at 5/8" intervals, with the center one      extending beyond the front cross brace by 4-3/4 inches),      and the handlebar is attached.<br />      <br />      Finally, screw the swivel-base casters in place beneath the      sled's four corners, and tie the tow rope through the holes      in the handlebar. A coat of varnish or polyurethane adds a      finishing touch, and your house-bound skidder is ready to      roll!    </p>
