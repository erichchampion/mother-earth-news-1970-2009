                    <p>      Reprinted by permission from ALASKA/monthly<br />      /$6 a year/130 Second Avenue South/Edmonds/Washington<br />    </p>		        <p>      My college student son and I were starting on one of our      all-too-few quail hunting trips when I noticed he was      packing along a rather mysterious paper shopping bag. The      bag was tightly closed at the top with a heavy cord and I      suspected that it held something special. As I found out      later, it did!    </p>    <p>      I was busily preparing dinner in our camper the first      evening out when Bob suddenly reached into the shopping bag      and pulled out a large mound-shaped loaf. "What's that?" I      asked.    </p>    <p>      Bob grinned a self-satisfied ear-to-ear grin and replied,      "Alaskan Sourdough bread. I made it myself."    </p>    <p>      "Yeah?" I said as I hefted the loaf. "Boy. It's heavy.      What's it taste like?"    </p>    <p>      "Oh, about as good as this," Bob said with forced      nonchalance as he plumped a second solid loaf on the      camper's table. "Try some."    </p>    <p>      For the next half hour we buttered and ate slice after      slice of both white and cracked wheat sourdough bread      and-although heavy-it was the first      honest-to-goodness "bread" I had eaten for many a year.      Bob's product was close-textured, heavy-bodied and had a      good crunchy crust. I hadn't enjoyed plain bread and butter      that way since bakers had started puffing vast quantities      of air into the "store bought" loaves on grocery shelves.    </p>    <p>      When we had eaten our fill (better than half a loaf between      us) I began asking Bob about the mechanics of sourdough of      sourdough bread.    </p>    <p>      "First," he said, "you need a starter."    </p>    <p>      "A starter? What's that?"    </p>    <p>      "This," said Bob, withdrawing a small earthenware crock      crock from the shopping bag, "is starter. It's one of the      most precious possessions of the old-time prospector in      Alaska. A starter is really just a culture of yeast      perpetually kept growing by use and replenishment."<br />    </p>    <p>      I lifted the lid on the crock and sniffed a somewhat      pleasant alcoholic odor. Bob's small batch of starter was      (except for size) strongly reminiscent of the crocks found      in so many homes during the futile days of prohibition. "It      smells like home brew," I said.    </p>    <p>      "Well, you know that yeast and fermentation have been known      to form a little alcohol from time to time," Bob replied      mischievously.    </p>    <p>      Alcohol or no alcohol, since Bob gave me that introduction      to sourdough, I've enthusiastically turned on the rest of      the family and many friends to baking with this      do-it-yourself yeast . . . and I now find myself living in      my own little clique of expert sourdough bakers and      connoisseurs. In the process we've all been exposed to a      large slice of the fascinating history of sourdough starter      or "sponge."    </p>    <p>      Tales about the origin, baking and consumption of sourdough      bread have become almost legend in the north country of      Canada and Alaska. It's said that-in a last ditch      effort to keep their precious starter from      freezing-old timers would put a glob of the sponge      into a small pouch and hang it from a cord around their      necks. They could then tuck the fragrant culture under      their long underwear and keep it "working" with the heat      from their bodies. In this way, the sour, half-spoiled      starter soon lent it's peculiar yeasty smell to a      prospector's cabin . . . and his own personal body odor as      well. Eventually the starter and the bread made from it      became so popular and commonplace among these men that the      miners and prospectors themselves became known as      "Sourdoughs."    </p>    <p>      It's also said that some of the original starters set by      the 1849 Alaskan and Yukon gold seekers are still being      used by modern-day cooks. I find this claim hard to believe      but it is possible since, each time bread is baked, part of      the batter is put back into the crock to serve as starter      for the next batch of dough. In theory at least, as long as      fresh bread is baked every week or two and the remaining      starter replenished with flour and warm water, the culture      of yeast will continue indefinitely.    </p>    <p>      If you're interested in making sourdough bread as the      oldtimers made it, your starter can be formulated by      dissolving a cake or a package of dry yeast in two cups of      warm water. Add two cups of flour and mix well. Put the      mixture in a warm place overnight and it will be ready for      use the next morning.    </p>    <p>      When making bread, hotcakes or whatever from this starter      always set aside one-half cup of the yeasty brew with which      to activate the next batch (sort of like leaving a cup of      water at the well to prime the pump). This first half-cup      of carry-over starter contains the yeast plants that will      multiply and age and eventually mellow through hundreds of      bakings into your own personal strain of sourdough.    </p>    <p>      Just as your sourdough starter will eventually become      uniquely your own, I'm sure that you'll eventually come up      with your own novel ideas of what should go into a      sourdough recipe. For example, I like cracked wheat and I      usually put a half-cup of cracked wheat flour into my      sourdough bread. Maybe youwill too, maybe not. You can't go      too far wrong, though, using the following recipe for your      introduction to sourdough baking.    </p>        <p><br /></p>                                            <p>      First, take out one-half cup of your new starter and set it      aside in the refrigerator for your second batch. To the      remaining yeasty mixture (usually about two cups), add:    </p>    <p>      1 cup whole wheat flour<br />      1 cup white flour<br />      2 tablespoons sugar<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons salt<br />      1/2 cup cracked wheat (optional)<br />    </p>    <p>      Mix the ingredients well and set the dough in a warm place.    </p>    <p>      After two or three hours, turn the dough out on a      well-floured board and knead in one or more cups of white      flour for about ten minutes. Shape into a loaf and place in      a well-greased baking pan. Grease the top and sides of the      loaf, cover with a towel and place in a warm place for an      hour or until the dough has nearly doubled in size. Bake in      a preheated oven at a temperature of 450° for ten      minutes, then turn heat back to 375° and bake for 35      minutes more.    </p>    <p>      To bake sourdough white bread, set a sponge the night      before by adding two cups of warm water and two cups of      flour to your starter. In the morning, save back one-half      cup of the batter to use as a starter for your next baking      effort and add two tablespoons of cooking oil to the      sponge. Mix well, then pour the sponge into the following      dry ingredients and mix thoroughly:    </p>    <p>      4 cups white flour<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      2 tablespoons sugar<br />    </p>    <p>      If necessary, add more flour until you have dough suitable      for kneading and knead on a floured board for about ten      minutes. Put dough in a greased bowl, cover with a towel      and let rise in a warm place for about three hours.    </p>    <p>      Dissolve a quarter-teaspoon of soda in a tablespoon of warm      water and knead into the dough. Shape dough into a loaf and      set in a baking pan to rise. When loaf has doubled in size,      bake at 375° for about 55 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Sourdough French bread, with its fine crunchy crust baked      to a golden brown, is also a taste tempter and I hope      you'll try it the next time you feel the need for a little      variety in your bread making. Except for the addition of a      package of yeast, the ingredients are the same as for      ordinary sourdough bread and here's the way we make ours:    </p>    <p>      Set a sponge the night before as called for in the white      bread recipe. Return one-half cup of the starter to the      refrigerator in the morning and, to the balance of the      sponge, add one package of yeast and two tablespoons of      fat. Mix well. Sift into a bowl:<br />    </p>    <p>      4 cups sifted flour<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      2 tablespoons sugar    </p>    <p>      Make a well in the center of these dry ingredients and pour      the sponge into the hole. Add enough flour to make a dough      and knead on a floured board for 15 minutes. Put knead      dough into a greased bowl, cover with a towel and allow to      raise until doubled (usually two to four hours in a warm      place). Dissolve one-quarter teaspoon of soda in a      tablespoon of warm water and knead it into the dough.      Divide dough in two and roll each half into a rectangle      measuring about 12 X 15 inches. Then, starting on one of      the wide sides, tightly roll each rectangle of dough and      seal the edges by pinching them together.    </p>    <p>      Sprinkle cornmeal on a greased baking sheet and place the      two loaves on the sheet. They should double in size in      about an hour. Brush the loaves with cold water and cut      several diagonal slits about one-fourth inch deep in each      loaf of bread.    </p>    <p>      Put the loaves and a pan of boiling water in a 400°      oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the bread, brush again      with water, set the oven temperature back to 350° and      bake the loaves another 40 minutes or until the crust is a      golden brown. Brush again with cold water and bake for      another two or three minutes.    </p>    <p>      Some home bakers like to give their French bread yet      another brushing with undiluted canned milk or heavy cream      before a final five minute baking. If you try this, you'll      find that an egg yolk mixed with one teaspoon of milk for      the last coating will give the finished loaves an even      richer yellowish-brown crust.    </p>    <p>      For an even more interesting variation on baking with your      starter, you might try sourdough muffins. They go mighty      good at breakfast and here's the recipe we use:    </p>    <p>      As with white and French bread, set a sponge the night      before by adding two cups of warm water and two cups of      flour to your crock. Next morning, set aside a half cup of      starter and mix 1/2 cup of melted fat and two eggs into the      remaining sponge. Then sift into a bowl:    </p>    <p>      1-1/2 cups whole wheat flour <em><br /></em> 1 teaspoon      salt<br />      1 teaspoon soda<br />      1/2 cup sugar<br />    </p>    <p>      Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add      the add the mixed starter. Stir just enough to moisten all      the flour. Raisins or chopped nuts can be added to the      batter if desired. Grease your muffin tins and fill each      hole about three-quarters full. Bake at 375° for 30      minutes.    </p>    <p>      During one of my wife's last sourdough sessions, she came      up with another good breakfast recipe. Although she claims      the finished product is bread, I classify the delicious      result as halfway between bread and coffee cake. For lack      of a better name, I'll call it Cinnamon Coffee Bread.    </p>    <p>      To make this coffee bread, follow the recipe for sourdough      French bread but substitute about a cup of raisins for the      cake of yeast just before dividing the dough and rolling it      out into two rectangles. Then generously spread the 12 X      15-inch pieces of dough with soft butter and sprinkle them      with cinnamon and about three-fourths cups of sugar before      tightly rolling and pinching them shut. Put the two loaves      in a warm place to rise and, when they've doubled in size,      bake them at 375° for 50 to 60 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Having sweetened me up with the cinnamon coffee bread, my      bride of 30 years next decided to knock out a sourdough      cake. It, as usual, was excellent and here's the formula:    </p>    <p>      To one-half cup of thick starter, add:    </p>    <p>      1/4 cup non-fat dry milk<br />      1-1/2 cups flour<br />      1 cup water<br />    </p>    <p>      Mix well and allow to ferment in a warm place for two or      three hours. There should be a clean, sour milk odor. Then      assemble:    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup shortening<br />      1 cup sugar<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons soda<br />      3 squares melted chocolate<br />      2 eggs<br />    </p>    <p>      Cream the shortening, sugar, salt, soda and flavorings. Add      the eggs one at a time and beat well. Then add the melted      chocolate and creamed mixture to the sourdough sponge and      mix at low speed until well blended. Pour into a pan and      bake at 350° for 30 to 40 minutes. Top with frosting if      you must, but I prefer mine plain.    </p>    <p>      Hotcakes made from sourdough starter have a distinctive      soft texture all their own and no treatise on sourdough      would be complete without a few words on the subject.    </p>    <p>      Our favorite sourdough hotcake recipe starts with the      setting of the usual sponge the night before. In the      morning (after saving one-half cup for starter!), add the      following:    </p>    <p>      2 eggs<br />      1 teaspoon soda<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1 tablespoon sugar<br />    </p>    <p>      Beat thoroughly with a fork and add two tablespoons cooking      oil. Bake on a hot griddle.    </p>    <p>      As with most other sourdough recipes, there's a lot of room      for personal preferences when mixing this hotcake batter.      We like to add a bit of cornmeal, for instance, and we      have-upon occasion-included a handful of      chopped walnuts for a pleasant taste change. Another treat      is the addition of a couple spoonfuls of fresh wild      raspberries once the hotcakes are on your plate.    </p>    <p>      In my opinion, however, there's one sure-fire way to      elevate sourdough hotcakes to a class far above any other      hotcakes in the world . . . and that's by mixing wild      blueberries into the batter. You'll just have to try it to      know how good hotcakes can be. Incidentally, frozen and      domesticated blueberries will not give you the same result      at all. The large domestic blueberries seem to release too      much moisture into the batter and they turn the pancakes      soggy. The "improved" berries also lack the wonderful      tartness of the wild blueberry.    </p>    <p>      So there you have it. A veritable cornucopia of good things      to eat from your sourdough starter crock. Treat it kindly      and that starter will serve you well!    </p>
