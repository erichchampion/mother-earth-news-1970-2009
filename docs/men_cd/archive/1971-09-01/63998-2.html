        Dennis Murphy makes his production candles by first casting ice cube-size chunks of colored wax in?naturally enough?ice cube trays (see lower photo on page 68). He then stockpiles these chunk.. of wax according to color in large paper bags (see photo at right) and places a handful of assorted cubes in his candle molds just after wicking and prior to filling the molds with hot wax of yet another color. The result is a multi-colored candle.
