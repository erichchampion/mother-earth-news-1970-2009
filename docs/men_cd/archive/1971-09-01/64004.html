                    <h5 id="byline">By ANNE M.T. DANIELS</h5>    		<p>If you want to conserve on cooking space, fuel and time,    you need a wok . . . the simple conical metal pan used by the    Chinese for centuries. Designed by a people perpetually faced    with too little food and fuel, the wok has "doing more with    less" written all over it. Only a little heat on its rounded    bottom goes a long, long way up its sides and the Chinese    practice of cutting food into bite-sized pieces insures that    each bit of heat will cook those edibles quickly enough to    preserve almost all their fresh taste and nutritional value.</p>    <p>      The wok need not be reserved only for Chinese dishes,      either. It can easily replace several pans and become the      main cooking vessel in any small city apartment in the      world . . . and one wok plus one tin can kettle is all      you'll need for cooking up a backwoods camping trip's rice,      noodles, vegetables, meats, eggs, pancakes and heaven knows      what else.    </p>    <p>      A wok works best over the flame or glowing coals that it      was designed for, which makes it a natural for outdoor or      fireplace meals. just nestle the pan in a ring of stones      (spaced to allow for draft) placed around some glowing      coals . . . wood, charcoal, corncob or whatever. The stones      will elevate the wok and contain the heat at the same time.      A flower pot hibachi of suitable size will also support a      wok nicely for outdoor cooking.    </p>    <p>      Certain modifications must be made if a wok is to be used      on a conventional stove. Unless the one you buy is large      with a flattish bottom, an adapter ring must be used to      support the pan and distribute heat over its bottom six or      eight inches. The adapter is also necessary if your wok has      only one handle . . . to keep the pan from tilting      unbalanced on a flat stove burner. This metal ring has      holes cut in its side to allow for draft and the assembly      resembles a deep dish pie plate with the bottom cut out . .      . in fact, you can probably make your ring out of just such      a plate.    </p>    <p>      Woks have become quite popular the past few years and you      probably won't have to go to Chinatown to get one. Most      stores that specialize in cooking utensils and offer more      than the usual run of Corning and Revere will carry a wok      of some sort. I got my twelve-incher at a      china-outlet-restaurant-supply store for about three      dollars.    </p>    <p>      Twelve inches (diameter across the top) is a nice size for      a wok. It's not too big to use for two, yet big enough to      turn out plenty of food-accompanied by rice cooked in      a sauce pan-to stuff six or eight people. Don't be      dismayed, however, if you have more mouths than that to      feed. Since the essence of many wok dishes is quick      preparation, it's no problem to cook up two or three      batches and serve them all before the first one starts to      get cold.    </p>    <p>      In buying a wok, choose one which has the top edge rolled      under so that the rim is smooth . . . the straight rim may      not be sharp enough to cut you, but it might be unpleasant      to work with and it certainly makes the wok more      susceptible to dents. Two handles (wood or smooth metal),      rather than one, are a convenience since they balance the      pan when it's on the flame and make a full wok easier to      carry.    </p>    <p>      Two-wok sets have qualities to recommend them and are a      good investment if you're just starting to accumulate      kitchenware. The large wok can be used for rice or noodles,      while the smaller one cooks the meat and vegetables. At      serving time, the smaller is simply inverted over the      larger. The two woks together will keep the food warm if      there are any last minute delays in getting the table or      the diners ready. Simply remove the top wok when you're      ready to eat.    </p>    <p>      Whatever kind of wok you do buy, follow the accompanying      instructions when using it for the first time. Usually a      coat of lacquer has been applied to protect the metal from      rust during shipping, and this must be removed before you      cook in the pan. The wok will also have to be "seasoned"      somewhat before it will give the best results.    </p>        <p>      Don't attempt to preserve the dull-gray, new look of a wok.      With use it will darken just as cast-iron ware does and,      like cast-iron, will become virtually stick-proof if a      little oil is used each time you cook. If anything does      happen to stick and burn onto the pan, don't worry. Simply      scrape out as much as you can and burn off the rest by      placing the empty wok over high heat (it's the same      principle used in the self-cleaning oven.) Never subject      your wok to harsh cleansers, scouring or soaking . . .      they'll all undo the seasoning.    </p>    <p>      The best introduction to using a wok I've found is Gary      Lee's THE WOK: A CHINESE COOKBOOK (put out by Nitty Gritty      Productions of Concord, California.) While it's expensive      ($4), it's lucid, entertaining and full of delightful      extras such as how to make your own salted eggs and do the      Chinese marinating-cooking process of "loooing." Lee      doesn't give a lot of recipes . . . instead, he sets down      basic techniques and rationale and then liberates you to      wing it on your own.    </p>    <p>      Frying of any kind is easy and economical in a wok since it      accomodates more food with less oil than a conventional      straight-sided pan does . . . but THE fundamental cooking      technique with a wok is "Chinese frying", also known as      "stir-frying".    </p>    <p>      The first step in stir-frying is to cut all the ingredients      into bite-sized pieces. Chinese practice dictates that      everything in the same dish should be cut into the same      shape and size. Size I agree with (for uniform cooking),      but shape? My fancy inclines to the Zen caprice of cutting      each ingredient into a different shape and having a variety      of color in the pan.    </p>    <p>      Once the ingredients are cut, assemble them in piles within      handy reach of the wok. For thickening, mix soy sauce and      cornstarch (1 tbsp. per two servings in 1/4 cup of soy)      with pinches of salt and sugar. Also have on hand any      necessary spices and-if you wish-MSG. (The      powdered dry seaweed that is sometimes added to Zen or      Japanese dishes is actually an organic source of MSG and      has been used by orientals for centuries as a      flavor-perker-upper. Be careful, though. Too much MSG will      make you thirsty and some people have strange reactions to      the seasoning.)    </p>    <p>      Only when all the ingredients are together is it time to      heat the wok. If the meat is raw, it's the first thing to      be cooked . . . otherwise the longer-cooking      vegetables-such as pepper and onions-are fried      first. After the wok is heated, start with about two      tablespoons of oil and then immediately add the meat or      other first ingredient.    </p>    <p>      In stir-frying, the food is continuously turned at the same      time that it's being moved from the center of the wok, up      its sides and back again . . . this way all sides of the      food are eventually cooked.    </p>    <p>      Since the Chinese use wooden chopsticks, I find that a a      slotted spoon works well for stirring and turning the food      as it fries but, a wooden spoon would also do nicely.    </p>    <p>      When the meat is half done, remove it and put the      vegetables (slower cooking ones first) and more oil (if      necessary) in the wok. When they're half done, put the meat      back in and finish cooking everything together. The      vegetables should be crisp-tender and never soft, the meat      (especially pork) cooked through, but not tough.    </p>    <p>      At the last minute, mix in the cornstarch-soy sauce      thickening and any spices. You may have to add a little      water to make the sauce, but usually the cooking of the      vegetables and meat will yield enough liquid. A lot of      sauce isn't wanted . . . just enough to cover the      ingredients and seep down a little into the rice or      noodles.    </p>    <p>      A wok can also be used for pan-frying and deep-frying . . .      it's especially good for cooking whole fish as the sides of      the pan will accomodate a fish without breaking it.    </p>    <p>      Steaming in a wok can be a delicate process for delicate      foods or-with steaming trays-a means of cooking      an entire meal in one pan over one fire. Steaming trays are      round bamboo constructions that fit snugly down the sides      of the wok . . . they stack on top of one another and have      lattice bottoms which allow steam to pass from the      simmering water in the bottom of the wok up through the      various trays.    </p>    <p>      The Chinese use steaming trays chiefly for the preparation      of their DEEM SUM-dumpling snacks-but they're      adaptable to many other dishes. With the trays, it's      possible to cook a whole western-style meal of potatoes,      vegetable and fish or meat over one flame. If parts of the      menu have different cooking times, simply put the trays in      one at a time . . . foods that take longest go in first.    </p>    <p>      To buy steaming trays, you'll probably have to go to a      Chinatown and find a store that sells housewares for      Chinese homes or supplies for Chinese restaurants. But the      design of the trays is not that complex, and it might be      possible for the ingenious to build them at home.    </p>    <p>      With or without steaming trays, though, you can start      enjoying quick, tasty and healthful meals just as soon as      you acquire a wok and master its simple techniques.    </p>
