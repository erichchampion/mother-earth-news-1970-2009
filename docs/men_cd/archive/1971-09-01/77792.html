                		<h5 id="byline">		  By Sam Wright		</h5>    <p>      THE BUGLE-AMERICAN/2909 N. HUMBOLDT AVENUE/<br />      MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN 53212/WEEKLY/$9.00 A YEAR.    </p>    <p>      <em>NOTE: The following was given in testimony by Mr.      Wright earlier this year before a Department of the      Interior hearing in Anchorage, Alaska, on environmental      impact of the proposed trans-Alaska oil pipeline.</em>    </p>        <p>      My name is Sam Wright. I am a resident of Brooks Range,      approximately 80 miles northeast of Bettles Field, north of      the Arctic Circle. I am not here to testify against the      development of Alaska's oil resources, but rather to speak      for her greatest resource, wilderness.    </p>    <p>      One definition of wilderness is that very few people      inhabit it. Therefore, there are few voices to speak from      within. As a resident in the Brooks Range, I feel it not      only my privilege, but my duty to speak for those voiceless      who might never be heard if I do not choose to represent      them.    </p>    <p>      Who are these voiceless? They are those who share this      planet-spaceship with us - whose presence here      defines our human qualities and concerns as much as any      social, human institution. They are the caribou who have      called this their home for thousands of years. They are the      wolf, the lynx, the fox, the wolverine. They are the      majestic Dall sheep, the grizzly bear, the gerfalcon and      the arctic loon. They are the millions of shore birds and      the arctic tern, who yearly flies eleven thousand miles      from Antarctica to nest by the lakes of this wilderness.    </p>    <p>      Who will speak for those spruce trees which struggle up the      Dietrich River, moving timberline north . . . trees whose      diameter is seldom more than eight inches but were      seedlings when George Washington was inaugurated our first      president?    </p>    <p>      Who will speak for solitude . . . one of the last places      where the ancient sounds of life can be heard without the      whine of gears or the drone of engines?    </p>    <p>      Who will speak for those of our own species to come, those      who will have no place left in the world uncontaminated by      their predecessors' self-righteous-need to convert      everything - including beauty and solitude -      into dollars?    </p>    <p>      Who will speak for this last great wilderness to remain      wilderness? For if it goes, it will never be returned. I      have no choice. I must speak because I am not voiceless,      and this is my home.    </p>    <p>      My wife and I are residents of the Brooks Range ire      northern Alaska. We live within ten miles of the proposed      trans-Alaska pipeline route along the Koyubuk and Dietrich      rivers. We know first-hand the wildlife, the long dark      winters and the endless summer sure north of the Arctic      Circle.    </p>    <p>      We have chosen to live in this last great wilderness,      disturbing it as little as possible and becoming a part of      its ecology. One reason for this choice several year ago      was the recognition that at this moment in histor this      great wilderness is doomed unless voices speak out in its      behalf. And certainly a voice should come from the      wilderness itself.    </p>    <p>      For myself arid those other inhabitants who with man share      this last undefiled place on this continent, those whom I      represent in this appeal, I say that all the oil in Alaska      is not worth the loss of this last great wilderness. This      wilderness is the heritage of us all. And since it is the      heritage of us all, we should ail have a voice in the      decisions which will determine its fate.    </p>    <p>      However, the destruction of our heritage has already begun      without our being heard . . . without a permit from the      Interior Department for the pipeline and the haul road that      would run beside it. Caravans of trailers and heavy      equipment have already been hauled up the Dietrich River      into the wilderness of the Brooks Range.    </p>    <p>      Bulldozers have already cut a swath north of timberline.      For months, great Hercules aircraft flew regularly over our      small isolated cabin in the wilderness-to Galbraith Lake-on      the north slope of the range . . . hauling in equipment for      the construction of the oil pipeline and haul road over the      pass. Helicopter loads of survey and construction crews,      with their attendant debris, were flown into the few lakes      in our area to fish for trout, which-in the northern      cold-take ten to twenty years to reach maturity. If the      bulldozing, construction camps, airfields and traffic can      function without the Department of Interior permit, there      is no question that to grant one will mark the end of our      last great wilderness.    </p>    <p>      If we permit the construction of a pipeline and its      accompanying haul road to be built through this wilderness,      we will not have moved forward or confronted the future      with vitality and courage. We will, instead, have taken a      giant step backward. For real progress is to recognize,      preserve and wisely use our resources. And our greatest      resource is in greatest jeopardy, because it can never be      replaced or recreated; it is the wilderness.    </p>    <p>      We cannot plead ignorance today as we have in the past. If      we permit the domestication and ultimate destruction of      this wilderness, we shall be condemned by our posterity for      having deprived them of their heritage. Our choice is not      between wilderness and oil. Our struggle is not between oil      companies and the public. Our common responsibility, in the      light of overwhelming scientific and technical evidence      presented by those who do not have a vested economic      interest in the decision confronting us, is to save the      wilderness.    </p>    <p>      I cannot speak for other people. They have a voice of their      own.    </p>    <p>      But for myself and my voiceless neighbors in the Brooks      Range, I appeal not only to the Secretary of the Interior,      but also to the President of the United States, my fellow      Alaskans, and particularly the representatives of the seven      oil companies who formed the Alyeska Pipeline Service      Corporation, to save this last great wilderness. When it      goes, there is no other.    </p>    <p>      - Sam Wright, 1971    </p>
