                <p>      <em>Well, folks, we're still not convinced it's a good idea      but there's definitely a<br />      growing trend (among some otherwise conservative organic      gardeners, too)</em> <em>to</em>    </p>            <p>      F.P. HUGHES reports on his experiments in Ontario,      Canada.<br />    </p>    <p>      Great bunches of onions, carrots and beets hang from the      joists in our basement this fall, the freezer is full to      the top with peas, beans and corn and Evelyn is beginning      to tire of canning tomatoes and making relish. In the      garden, several rows of cabbages are waiting to be cut just      before first frost and a bountiful harvest of cauliflower      will be ready just after. We shan't be buying vegetables in      the supermarket for some time.    </p>    <p>      Although we've gardened for years, this is the first time      we reaped such a superabundance of produce. Needless to      say, there <em>is</em> a gimmick . . . but a gimmick anyone      can use. We've simply learned about black polyethylene      mulch.    </p>    <p>      Mulching, one of nature's oldest processes, has long been      used by natural gardeners to control weeds and conserve      moisture around fruit, vegetable and flower plants.      Traditionally, only hay, grass clippings, leaves and other      easily biodegradeable matter has been used for this job.      Recently, though, a number of gardeners have begun      spreading sheets of black poly (a seemingly unlikely mulch)      across their gardens with rather startling results.    </p>    <p>      We discovered plastic mulch two years ago in the Canadian      Department of Agriculture's book, <em>Growing Vegetable      Transplants.</em> The publication said, "Black polyethylene      film, usually 1-1/2 mils thick, is spread over the ground      and the edges are covered with soil. Slits or holes are      made in the film to allow planting through the film. The      black film over the soil tends to warm the soil, reduce      evaporation and prevent weed growth. Each of these effects      is beneficial to crop plants."    </p>        <p>      That sounded good to us so we checked around and found that      black poly is available almost anywhere transparent      polyethylene is sold (hardware stores, farmers' supply      houses, lumber yards, etc etc.) The black, 1-1/2-mil sheets      come in rolls 100 feet long and 36 inches wide and      currently costs about $2.50 a roll.    </p>    <p>      May I draw a veil over our first year's mistakes?    </p>    <p>      This year, with a little experience behind us, we started      our garden just after the snow left the ground. First we      cultivated the soil lightly, then put 10-foot-long strips      of polyethylene down side by side with about a tenth of an      inch between the edges. We planted early peas in this      narrow "slot" and finished off that section of the garden      by spreading about an inch of loose soil over the plastic      to hold it down out of the wind.    </p>    <p>      One sunny but cold day shortly thereafter, we pushed a      thermometer into the soil under the poly. It registered      nearly fifty degrees. In unprotected soil nearby, the      temperature was just over freezing. No wonder the peas      germinated early!    </p>    <p>      Later we rolled out more of the poly and set onions through      it. Since the onions were bigger and we wanted them farther      apart than we had planted the peas, we simply made      two-inch-long slits through the plastic for each onion and      pushed the sets through the slits.    </p>    <p>      Don't try sowing small seeds - even seeds as big as      peas - through slits this way. If the poly sheet      moves ever so slightly as it will when you walk on it (yes,      we walk on ours . . . but only in soft, light shoes), the      small seeds will not find their way up to the sunshine and      the air. Instead, they suffer the fate of weeds and smother      under the plastic. We lost a lot of our 1969 crop this way.    </p>    <p>      For parsnips, carrots and other small-seeded plants, we      slit the black poly lengthwise into strips ten inches wide      and ten feet long. We placed these strips side by side with      their edges an inch apart and, as we did with the peas, we      then planted the tiny seeds in the narrow slot of earth      that was left.    </p>        <p>      By the way, there's nothing particularly magic about the      fact that we cut all our plastic sheets ten feet long. Our      garden just happens to be that distance across. If your      vegetable patch is twelve feet wide, cut your strips to      reach. If the garden has exceptionally long rows, however,      you may want to lay down a series of shorter pieces instead      of one long strip of poly. Long strips are too liable to      blow about in the wind . . . which always seems to get up      just when the plastic is in the most awkward position. Your      strips should simply be as long as you find convenient.    </p>    <p>      Convenience is worth looking for. When I was planting those      onions I crouched down to cut the slit, then sat up      straight, found an onion in the sack, planted that and      - finally - moved on to the next position.      Evelyn - attracted by my mutterings and groans      - looked thoughtful for a moment, then brought out an      empty five gallon drum from behind the barn.    </p>    <p>      "Here," she said, "try this. Turn the drum on its side so      it'll roll and sit on it."    </p>    <p>      I did as she said and found the small barrel to be a      comfortable moving seat, easy to roll back along the poly      as I continued to plant onions every six inches . . . until      the school bus brought our daughter home. When she saw all      the fun I was having-rolling along backward, sowing onions      through the slits <em>-she</em> took over the task. I was      demoted to scattering earth on top of the plastic strips to      keep them down.    </p>    <p>      After the peas had been harvested, we rolled up the black      poly to take a look at the weeds that had tried to grow      under it. All of them were white from lack of light (a      botanist would say "etiolated") and most were lifeless.      Without air and light, they could not survive. The weeds      that had sprung up in the inch or two of soil covering the      polyethylene had also quickly died . . . of thirst, as that      shallow seedbed dried out.<br />    </p>    <p>      A few weeds, of course, did grow between the edges of the      polyethylene strips where the soil was left bare for the      peas. Weeding here, however, was a small chore compared to      the endless hacking with the hoe that would have been      needed if we hadn't used the plastic mulch. One or two      stray volunteers sprouted up through the slits made for the      onions, too, but they were easily pulled by hand.    </p>    <p>      Be that as it may, there was one weed that surprised us no      end. As the summer wore on we came to ignore the volunteer      plants that sprang up across the polyethylene because we      knew they were growing in only an inch of soil and would      soon die. One especially large and healthy volunteer did      attract Evelyn's attention, though, and she gave it a heave      . . . only to find that the plant had sprouted through a      hole in the plastic. We didn't think much about it until,      later, we found another weed . . . and another . . . and      another . . . always the same kind of grass and always      growing through a hole in the poly.    </p>    <p>      At last it dawned on us that this grass - later      identified as "quack" or "twitch" grass - can      actually push its way up through the plastic. We've since      found that it will also creep out from under the edges of      the poly. The survival mechanisms built into this grass are      unbelievable.    </p>    <p>      Actually, the quack grass - although definitely hardy      - is not the overwhelming danger it might seem and we      only had our major troubles with it when we were breaking      new soil. In our old plot, where we've gardened for years,      the twitch grass has long been weeded out, so to speak.    </p>    <p>      We've also found that quack grass cannot grow through loose      plastic and, after some time underneath, it dies. So now,      in previously unworked ground where the grass may be      lurking, we leave the plastic loose and keep it in place by      burying the edges of each shee a few inches deep. The      strips billow up in a fresh breeze, but they stay put.      Evelyn likes to lay a two-by-four on each loose piece of      plastic when there's a high wind but I don't think it's      necessary. After a season with the poly buried only around      the edges to kill off the twitch grass, we go back to the      neater method of securing the plastic with an inch of soil      across its surface.    </p>    <p>      What happens to the rain that falls on the poly? With the      exception of a little that stays on top where the plastic      is dished by irregularities in the ground, it seems that      most of the water runs off the edges of the strips and      soaks into the soil. To be sure, the small amount of      rainfall trapped on top of each sheet evaporates . . . on      the other hand, the plastic prevents a much larger      evaporation from the soil and smother all the weeds that      would otherwise drink the moisture in the earth. On      balance, I don't believe there's any loss of water from the      ground. The poly, in fact, seems to help the earth      <em>hold</em> water, if anything.    </p>    <p>      Our success with black poly mulch was noteworthy enough      this season to make us want to experiment further next      year. We're going to try to adapt the plastic to the flower      beds for one thing, and it should be quite a challenge to      get all the blooms in the correct position and the correct      order.    </p>    <p>      We'd also like to try "sterilizing" an area by covering it      with a 10-foot by 50-foot roll of poly. This should allow      us to start a lawn free of dandelions, plantain and all the      other weeds that compete for the space. This seems to us to      be a better idea than poisoning the ground with      weedkillers.    </p>    <p>      Yep. We're going to keep working with our newfound mulch.      Plastic or no, it seems to give us good results. So good,      in fact, that we just may run out of hanging, canning and      freezing room if we aren't careful!    </p>
