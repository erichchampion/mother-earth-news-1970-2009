                <p>      <em>Clarence Massey's recipes for sourdough on the      preceeding four pages are darn good ones . . . But there's      more than one formula for sourings and the baked goods made      from them. Here's two more variations on the theme. It's      especially interesting that Cathy Johnson and Clarence      Massey both knead their dough long and vigorously while      Dudley Shaw cautions against unnecessary handling of the      dough. Since both methods obviously produce the desired      result, it seems that sourdough will work most any ole way      you want to make it.</em>    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By CATHY JOHNSON SEZ:</h5>        <p>      If you're tired of forgetting the yeast or tired of whole      wheat bread's tendency to crumble (mine, a no-knead recipe,      does anyway) or just tired of the same old taste . . . try      some bread with real body. Try sourdough.    </p>    <p>      There's a number of recipes for sourdough starter and most      of them scare off the beginner by calling for potatoes and      other things more complicated and esoteric than you may      have on hand. Forget them. Life wasn't meant to be that      difficult. I've rummaged through the cookbooks and      amalgamated the following formula that works (for me, at      least) perfectly every time:    </p>    <p>      1 cup rye flour<br />      1/2 cup lukewarm water (can be potato cooking water if you      have it but we've found that it's not necessary.<br />      1/2 cake or 1/2 tablespoon dry yeast, softened in another      1/2 cup warm water.    </p>    <p>      Stir these ingredients together and put the mixture in a      clean crock with a lid if you have one . . . if not, a bowl      with a plate on it, an enameled pan with a lid or even a      nice big jar should do (just don't screw the lid down too      tight or you may find yourself cleaning sourdough off half      the Free World).    </p>    <p>      Without stirring or disturbing the starter, allow it to      rise and fall until it gets as sour as you want it. And how      sour should that be? We didn't know either the first time      through, so we just ad-libbed and let ours get      <em>good</em> and sour. The original recipe said, "allow to      work two or three days" but our first batch, sitting next      to the wood heater (on the cold floor` took about four.      Once the starter is sour, put it in the refrigerator till      you're ready to use it.    </p>    <p>      Now for the good part . . . the sourdough bread!    </p>    <p>      I like to experiment with my cooking and I've evolved a      kind of a health-food, German-style, made-up bread recipe      that you might want to try. Take one cup of starter and      add:    </p>    <p>      1-1/2 quarts lukewarm water (the original recipe called for      potato cooking water . . . but how would you ever      <em>get</em> that much if you cooked your potatoes in as      little water as possible to retain the vitamins? What I did      was use 2/3 cup potato water and plain water for the rest.      I think plain water all the way through would work just as      well.)<br />      1/2 cup blackstrap molasses<br />      6 cups rye flour    </p>    <p>      Mix well, cook and let the sponge "work" about three hours      in a warm place until it gets nice and sour. Stir, take out      one cup of starter for your next batch (and, believe me,      there'll be a next batch!) and store the starter in your      refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Stir two tablespoons salt (we use flake salt from the feed      store but, since it contains no iodine, sea salt is      probably better for you) and two tablespoons lard or other      shortening into into the remaining sponge.    </p>    <p>      Add about four more cups flour (I use a mixture of rice      polishings and corn, wheat, soy, rye and millet flour that      we get from a health-food store in Kansas City) and stir      well. Keep adding flour and stirring until you have a      kneadable mixture. The original recipe called for ten cups      but I've ended up using as much as 13, including what I put      on the board to knead on (and in). The dough should be      stiff.    </p>    <p>      Knead until the dough isn't sticky anymore. Shape it into      three round loaves (or two, if you want big ones), place on      oiled cookie sheets or in old pie tins (or even new ones .      . . what the heck!) and put in a warm place to let rise      approximately two to three hours or until dough has      expanded in size by a third. I make cuts in the top of the      sponge and judge the dough's expansion by how the cuts      swell open.    </p>    <p>      If you cook on a wood stove-as I do-and your      fire hasn't already been going all day, start stoking the      blaze about an hour before the bread's due to be risen. At      least that's how long it takes <em>me</em> to get mine hot      enough. Contrary to the articles in MOTHER NO. 7, our      little cookstove does <em>not</em> seem to get too hot. My      fault, probably.    </p>    <p>      We have mainly soft maple and elm kindling and oak and      walnut for the main fire . . . but to really stoke our      stove on up there, I've found that corncobs are the thing      to use. They're <em>hot!</em>    </p>    <p>      My stove's oven doesn't have a thermometer-not even      the "warm-medium-hot" kind-so I put my little      dimestore oven thermometer in there and it works fine.    </p>    <p>      Anyway, the temperature to shoot for is 350° F. If you      have a gas or electric range, just preheat to that setting      and forget it. If it's wood you're using, be prepared with      <em>lots</em> of corncobs . . . you'll have to maintain      that temperature for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours.    </p>    <p>      I've found that it's easier to hold oven heat on my      cookstove if I partially close the damper and reduce the      draft once the stove is really roaring. It seems to keep      the heat in and I don't have to jump up and down tending      the fire nearly as much as I did last week when I made      chocolate chip cookies. Then, I had the draft wide open and      it just blew the fire right away. It took me almost an hour      and a half to get the oven to register 225° F. and      another hour and a half to bake three sheets of cookies.      Live and learn.    </p>    <p>      Anyway, if you're cooking with wood, you'll certainly have      worked up an appetite for that good old-time sourdough      bread by the time it's done. We cut ours as soon as it's      finished and put a <em>lot</em> of butter on it . . . and      we figure we'll want some other kind of bread about 1989!    </p>    <p>      We'll probably be using the same starter then, too. Some      sourdough starters have been kept alive for over 100 years      and handed down through generations just like family      silver. I can't think of a nicer thing to inherit.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      Brad and Vena Angier, authors of a number of books about      their homesteading experience in the bush country of      British Columbia (see MOTHER'S Bookshelf) have often told      how they were introduced to sourdough by seventy-year-old      B.C. trapper Dudley Shaw.    </p>    <p>      Dudley preferred to launch his starter with four cups of      flour, enough warm water to make a thick, creamy batter and      an optional two tablespoons of sugar and two teaspoons of      salt . . . although he allowed that a yeast cake dissolved      in warm water would hasten the brew. He also mentioned that      some oldtimers found it handy to add a tablespoon of      vinegar to the original batch or to any aged sourings that      needed reviving.    </p>    <p>      "Mix three-fourths of this initial starter with a      tablespoon of melted fat and a cup of flour in which a      teaspoon of baking soda has been well stirred," was      Dudley's advice, "then add whatever additional flour is      needed to make a smoothly kneading dough . . . and keep      attacking. Don't gentle it. Too much pushing and pressing      lets the gas escape that's needed to raise the stuff. Just      bang the dough together in a hurry, cut off loaves to fit      your pans and put them in a warm place to raise."    </p>    <p>      Let the dough plump out to double size, then bake it from      forty minutes to one hour in an oven that is hottest during      the first fifteen minutes and, according to Dudley, your      bread will again be doubled in size and baked crisply done.      If you want to test the loaves before cutting, jab `em with      a straw. It should come out dry and "at least as clean as      it was when inserted".    </p>    <p>      In the usual sourdough tradition, Dudley recommended that      the Angiers recycle the cup of saved-back starter into a      long series of baking adventures but he cautioned that they      should always "cover the sourings loosely or they'll      explode all over the place. Makes a ghastly mess. Remember      they bubble copiously to better than double size, so use a      container that's vast enough. When the mixture gets too      rampageous, a touch of baking soda will gentle it."    </p>    <p>      Dudley added that too much soda could make the bread      yellowish or even kill the sourdough altogether . . . and      not enough would leave the bake: goods tasting sour.      Experience is the best teacher.    </p>    <p>      The Angiers report that Dudley ended his lesson by      presenting them with a batch of 14-year-old starter. When      they gasped at the age of the sourings, he beamed, "They've      just started nicely."    </p>
