                    <p>      to prevent that blank look on your face when the      salesperson speaks of a "full tang."    </p>        <p>      <strong>STAMPED KNIVES:</strong> Most less-expensive knives      are stamped from sheet steel and are lighter and thinner      than forged knives. Stamping can produce a decent blade,      but without the heaviness of a bolster larger stamped      knives may feel flimsy and unstable when used to cut      hard-surfaced foods such as watermelon.    </p>        <p>      <strong>FORGED KNIVES</strong> : Forged blades are made by      heating crude steel to more than 2,000Â°F and shaping it      with a mold and a hammer. The blade is then ground down,      tempered, sharpened and finished off. Forging is a      labor-intensive process, which is reflected in the cost of      the knives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BOLSTER:</strong> A sure sign of a forged knife is      a bolster - a thick collar of metal between the blade and      the handle. Manufacturers claim that the bolster adds      weight and balance to the knife, but it also keeps the      user's hand away from the blade, which makes the knife      safer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TANG:</strong> In a full-tang knife, the blade      metal extends to the end of the handle. According to      manufacturers who produce full-tang knives, this gives the      knife more balance. The full tang is visible on wood handle      knives; on synthetic handles, full tang would mean that the      blade extends at least 60% of the way through the handle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROCKWELL HARDNESS SCALE</strong> : This is a      progressive measurement in degrees used to rate the steel's      hardness: from 52 for soft steel to 60 for high-carbon      stainless steel.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CARBON STEEL:</strong> This is the oldest type of      steel used for knives and is hardened at 53 degrees      Rockwell. Carbon steel is easy to sharpen, but these knives      will rust and stain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STAINLESS STEEL:</strong> Stainless steel knives,      first popular in the 1920s, resist rust and staining. The      blade is 61 degrees Rockwell, which means that it's too      hard to be sharpened on a steel and can only be sharpened      professionally.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HIGH-CARBON STAINLESS STEEL:</strong> Most      manufacturers now combine the positive characteristics of      both of the above; high carbon makes the knives easier to      sharpen while the stainless steel keeps them from getting      stained and corroded. Every manufacturer has its own metal      recipe with some containing molybdenum and vanadium steel.      The specific combination determines how hard a blade is,      how difficult it is to sharpen, and how long it will hold      an edge. If a knife's Rockwell hardness is in the mid-50s,      it should be easy to sharpen but still maintain a sharp      edge.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLYBDENUM / VANADIUM:</strong> Molybdenum is added      to the steel mix to counteract the brittleness that's in      hard steels, and vanadium contributes a unique, microscopic      grain that makes it possible to grind a very sharp edge.    </p>
