                        <p>      In March, a small relative of blackbirds and grackles that      lives year-round in the southern U.S. but spreads north in      spring may become quite noticeable on the ground in fields      and pastures. Named for their feeding habits, cowbird      flocks often gather near horses and cows to feast on the      insects those animals attract. But the cowbird's behavior      at nesting time is what has earned it its fame - or rather,      its notoriety.    </p>    <p>      Male cowbirds are about seven inches long with a brown head      and neck the rest of the body is black and iridescent. The      all-gray female is less distinctive, but she can typically      be seen flocking with the males.    </p>    <p>      The cowbird can seem a rather comical creature with a slow,      awkward walk and often upraised tail.    </p>    <p>      Less amusing is the cowbirds' habit of laying their eggs in      the nests of other birds. Most birds need 20 minutes to an      hour to lay an egg, but the female cowbird takes less than      a minute; she leaves her egg in secret while the nest's      rightful owner is away. The unwitting nesters will usually      accept the cowbird egg and raise the baby cowbird as their      own.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, cowbird eggs hatch sooner than the eggs of      other species and the young cowbirds grow quickly, using      their size to their advantage in getting more food from the      parents. This cowbird parasitism is actually endanger ing a      number of species of birds.    </p>
