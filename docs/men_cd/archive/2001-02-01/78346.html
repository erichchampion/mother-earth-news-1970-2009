                    <h3>      LEFTOVERS    </h3>    <p>      If you have a chunk of dough left over after the first      rising, don't toss it out - freeze it! Thaw it out later      for an easy pizza crust. It can also be mixed in to      sourdough and other yeast breads.    </p>    <h3>      RISING CONDITIONS    </h3>    <p>      Ideal rising conditions are a moist and warm environment,      about 68°F. I like to use plastic bags over dough to      keep the moisture in and leave it, after the second rising,      with a damp and shiny - almost tacky - surface.    </p>    <h3>      ACCURATE MEASURING    </h3>    <p>      Accuracy in weights and measures is vital to successful      bread. You should always weigh the flour at least once to      get the equivalent in cup measures. The water measure or      weight is even more important - a tablespoon one way or the      other will make a difference. Salt and yeast must also be      measured accurately.    </p>    <h3>      MANAGING ATMOSPHERE    </h3>    <p>      For temperatures over 75°F (24°C), you can      compensate by taking 1 tablespoon of water at a time away      from the basic recipe. Keep in mind that the dough should      be tough. If you're baking when temperature tops 90°F      (32°C), increase the salt (1 teaspoon for the recipe)      and use cold tap water to compensate.    </p>    <h3>      A WORD ON FLOUR    </h3>    <p>      All-purpose flour has 11.5 percent gluten protein instead      of the 12.5 percent in usually found in bakers' bread      flour. Due to the lengthy rising times required for this      recipe, this gluten difference is incidental.    </p>
