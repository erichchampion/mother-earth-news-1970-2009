                            <p>      Most residential photovoltaic (PV) systems consist of PV      modules, a battery bank to store the electricity, a charge      controller to regulate the charging of the batteries, and      an inverter to change the solar-generated direct current      electricity into the more commonly used alternating      current. People living in remote areas of the U.S., off the      grid, have been relying on these types of PV systems for      years. However, more and more people who are already      connected to the grid are turning to renewable energy for      part or all of their electricity needs. These grid-tied PV      systems send solar-generated electricity back into the      already existing utility grid.    </p>    <p>      With a grid-tied system there is no battery bank - the      utility company acts as the battery. (Many people choose to      keep batteries, however, as a backup in case of grid      failure.) When a system produces more electricity than is      needed, the excess is sold to the utility company. When the      homeowner needs more electricity than is being produced,      electricity is bought from the utility company. Under      federal law, the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act      (PURPA, Section 210), utility companies are required to buy      electricity from renewable energy producers.    </p>    <p>      The other difference in grid-tied systems is the type of      inverter used. Line-tied inverters are designed to sense      the presence of grid power and shut off when the grid does.      This keeps the PV-generated electricity off the grid in      case there are utility people working on it.    </p>    <p>      The majority of grid-tied PV systems use PV modules mounted      on a roof or a pole near the house. However, some systems      use PV cells that actually become an integrated part of the      building (a common example are PV roof tiles). While these      systems may reduce the cost of PV systems, they are still      about 50% more expensive than standard PV modules. And      standard PV modules don't come cheap.    </p>    <p>      For more information:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Solar Energy International</strong> ,<br />      P.O.

Still, many      people are turning to this clean-energy option for reasons      of ecology rather than economy. Most of our electricity      comes from coal, oil or large hydroelectric dams, all of      which have devastating environmental impacts. The use of      solar power can reduce dependence on these environmentally      damaging sources. In fact, a one-kilowatt PV system can      prevent 150 pounds of coal from being mined and 300 pounds      of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each month.    </p>    <p>      These facts convinced Randy Udall, director of the      Community Office of Resource Efficiency (CORE) in Aspen,      Colorado that PV is cost-effective. "Conventional energy      economics assumes that the future is worthless and the      environment doesn't matter," Randy says. "If you value the      future or the environment, PV is cost-effective."    </p>    <p>      To encourage more homeowners to invest in PV systems, CORE      started a fi nancing program. Through CORE's program,      customers make a small down payment and receive a      zero-interest loan to pay for the rest of their system over      four to six years. CORE pays the interest on the loan.    </p>    <h3>      SPINNING BACKWARDS    </h3>    <p>      One thing that makes grid-tied PV attractive to homeowners      is net metering. Under PURPA, utility customers can sell      excess electricity to the utility company. However, the      utility only needs to purchase that electricity at the      wholesale price - much lower than the retail price. The      excess energy is metered using an additional meter that      must be installed at the customer's expense. But if the      utility offers net metering, the customer can use the      excess electricity to offset electricity used during the      billing period. Currently, 30 states require at least some      utilities to offer net metering. To find out about net      metering contact the National Renewable Energy Laboratory      in Golden, Colorado, or visit      <em>http://www.homepower.com/netmeter.htm .</em>    </p>    <p>      Related info:<br />      Guerrilla Solar    </p>
