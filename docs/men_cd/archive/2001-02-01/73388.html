                    <p>      The way to better cukes, tomatoes and a host of other      veggies - is up.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Brook Elliot    </h5>            <p>      It wasn't just the cucumbers that had him surprised. A good      percentage of my garden grows upward, instead of outward.      Indeed, my vegetable patch is a virtual forest of stakes,      wire towers, trellises and other supports. In fact, it's      always a shock to me to see gardens that do not use      vertical supports. Toward the end of this season, for      instance, I visited a friend who was very proud of his      garden, especially his tomato patch. "I've got five      varieties growing," he exclaimed, "each a different color.      What a beautiful display they make."<br />    </p>    <p>      When I got there, however, I found his tomatoes running      wild, with no supports. The ground was a jungle of vines,      with a lot of half-rotted fruit lying on the damp ground.      Nearby, where he'd grown his tomatoes a previous year,      there was a mass of volunteer plants choking out his wife's      flowers.    </p>    <p>      Of the many reasons to grow crops vertically, the biggest      is space. By training vegetables upward, you can plant more      in the same area. This method also frees up ground for      other crops.    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind that most plant spacing recommendations are      based on the use of mechanical cultivators, but in a      vertical garden, you can grow veggies surprisingly close to      one another.    </p>    <p>      Take those cukes Pat admired so much. I grew them on a      plastic mesh trellis, 8' long and 6' high. Seeds were      planted in rows four inches outwards on both sides of the      fencing, and the plants were thinned to 4" apart - that's      right, only 4". The end result is a wall of cucumber vines      whose flowers are fully exposed to bees and other      pollinators, which results in a higher crop yield.    </p>    <p>      When you grow vertically, each plant gets more sunlight      than if it were sprawling on the ground, which in turn      produces stronger plants with exuberant foliage growth.      These leaves provide enough shade to prevent sunscald, even      though the fruits appear to be more exposed. In fact, the      leaves provide so much coverage that I'll often find      veggies my wife and I missed while harvesting.    </p>    <p>      What's more, by growing vertically you avoid the unsightly      mess vining plants form when allowed to run helter-skelter      along the ground. If you use standard 30" or 36" beds,      sprawl can extend across beds, limiting what you can plant.      Tomato vines, for instance easily pull downward and smother      neighboring crops.<br />    </p>    <p>      Pest control is simpler as well. Because each plant and      leaf is fully exposed, you can easily see any problem      developing and take the steps to correct it. Once you      discover the ease of picking squash bugs off a climbing      vine, you'll never again want to face the chore of chasing      them through a ground-level jungle.    </p>    <p>      Greater visibility and accessibility make a vertical      harvest much easier as well. Also, with none of the      vegetables lying on the damp ground, you reduce the chances      of losing your crop to rot.    </p>    <p>      Virtually any vining plant can be grown vertically. Some      will need help in the form of ties or mesh supports, and      you will often have to take time to train the vine onto the      support. This can be a problem with cucumbers and legumes,      which want to sprawl on the ground.    </p>    <p>      With large-fruited vines, such as melons and squashes,      you'll have to support the individual fruits to keep their      weight from pulling the whole plant down. The easiest way      to do this is with recycled pantyhose. Just encase the      young fruit inside the toe of the pantyhose leg then tie      the hose to the support structure. The stocking is soft and      stretchy, so there's plenty of room as the fruit grows and      expands. Or, you can merely create a sling that supports      the melon or squash.    </p>    <p>      A lady friend has suggested that old brassieres work for      this purpose. This might be whimsical, but I'm not sure      it's practical.    </p>        <h3>      VYING FOR SUPPORT    </h3>    <p>      Support structures range from simple stakes to elaborate      trellises, tipis and A-frame structures. Here's a rundown      of options.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother Nature</strong> Tall, thick-stemmed plants      can be used as supports for other crops. The most typical      example of this are pole beans growing up corn stalks - an      idea that predates European contact with the New World.      Other plants, work nicely for this purpose; sunflowers, for      instance, also make ideal stakes for beans.    </p>    <p>      In colonial days, gardeners used pea sticks, made by      recycling brush and branch trimmings. A strong central      staff with holes bored through    </p>    <p>      Growing upward instead of outward results in greater space      economy, easier harvests, and a feast that's easy on the      eyes.    </p>    <p>      it every inch or two was pushed into the ground, and thin      branches pushed through the holes. Peas were then trained      to grow on this ladder.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stakes</strong> Everything from cut lumber to      bamboo has been used as a support stake for vegetable      plants. When choosing a stake, make sure it will be strong      enough and tall enough to support the plant. Many bean      poles, for instance, have vines extending 8' to 12'. Don't      forget, too, that tendril-less plants, like tomatoes, will      need to be tied to stakes.    </p>    <p>      My favorite stake material is standard one-inch lumber. I      rip boards into strips the same width as the board's      thickness. This gives me stakes that are 3/4"square, a good      size for most plants. Plus, these stakes are just the right      size for building other support structures.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tipis and A-frames</strong> These are a good way to      maximize limited space, especially for peas and beans.      What's more, the ground inside the tipi, being shaded by      the vines, stays cooler and moister. You can extend cool      weather crops, such as lettuce, several weeks by growing      them inside the tipi. These can be made from the same 3/4"      stakes described above. Simply lean five or six of them      against each other and tie them together at the point where      they cross.    </p>    <p>      A-frames can be a bit more elaborate than tipis. To make      them, create off-centered X's at one end by bolting two      stakes together. You can join as many of these together as      you want by attaching them across the top with a cross      stake. I find that four X's extending 36" gives me a nicely      sized A-frame that just fits over a standard bed. Anything      longer than that makes it difficult to tend the secondary      crop inside.    </p>            <p>      <strong>Towers</strong> A tower will provide ample support      for a single plant, such as a tomato vine. Commercial wire      cones, for instance, are actually towers, but most of them      are too skimpy. It's better to make your own; you can use      woven wire fenc ing to create a cylinder 18" to 24" in      diameter. Be sure to use wire with openings large enough to      let you reach in and harvest the fruit. The smallest      practical size for these openings is 4" x 4", and 6" x 6"      is really none too large.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Trellises</strong> A trellis is nothing more than a      short fence with a frame around it. Materials range from      netting and plastic mesh to lattice and woven wire. When      choosing materials, consider whether it's strong enough to      support the crop. Will it be easy to clean up at the end of      the season? Is it nontoxic? Is it portable?<br />    </p>    <p>      I've concluded that woven wire is the best all-around      material. It requires no top frame, can support just about      any plant, allows for easy removal of dead vines at      season's end, and is easy to relocate.    </p>        <p>      If you are growing a major crop then woven wire can also be      used to create a full fence, built to any length. Add an      interesting twist to your garden by building walk-in      spirals and mazes with woven wire. Imagine, for instance,      beans growing on a spiral fence with a quiet, secluded      garden bench at its center.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Arbors</strong> Typically thought of as supports      for flowers and vining fruits, there's no reason arbors      can't be used for vegetables as well - they are the      <em>ultimate</em> in trellises.    </p>    <p>      High on my wish list is a trellis with a computer station    </p>    <p>      inside. I could write while out in the garden, snacking on      the beans available at arm's length. Just another benefit      of vertical growing.<br />    </p>
