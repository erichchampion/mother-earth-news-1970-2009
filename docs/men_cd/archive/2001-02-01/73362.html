        <p>As fuel prices soar and concern over the environment's health grows, the time seems ripe for a gas additive that would boost mileage and reduce automobile emissions. According to Paul Waters, scientific adviser to General Technology Applications and a professor at American University in Washington, D.C., it's already here. Since 1924, when lead was added to gas tanks as an antiknock agent, everything that's come down the pike has been a poison, an energy sapper, or in the case of MTBE (methyl-t-butyl ether) an environmental catastrophe. Viscom, however, can boost mileage by 20 percent while reducing emissions by 70 percent. "It's like a magic elixir," Waters says.
