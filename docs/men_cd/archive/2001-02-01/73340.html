                    <p>      Because my partner and I have started eating less meat, we      find ourselves eating more cheese. We try to buy the      cheeses in bulk or blocks because it's less expensive, but      we found it would often develop mold long before we could      eat it. To resolve that problem, we wrapped the cheeses      in-what else? - cheesecloth. But here's the secret trick:      we wet the whole bundle down on all sides with plain white      vinegar and keep the moistened bundles in a plastic Ziploc      in the fridge. As long as the cheesecloth is kept damp with      vinegar, we have found that mold takes much longer to form.      I keep all of my cheeses in one or two bags and remoisten      them with vinegar as needed. You can also cut the labels      from the packages and rubber-band them to the individual      chunks. This step isn't necessary, but it saves you from      having to unwrap each bundle to distinguish cheddar from      colby! Furthermore, the cheesecloth is very inexpensive and      reusable, just wash with hot soapy water and hang to dry.      When it becomes threadbare, use it to tie up your tomato      plants or toss it in the compost. Good of cheesecloth, who      woulda thought?    </p>    <p>      SAM MCFARLAND<br />      Turlock, California    </p>
