                    <p>      <strong>An Interview with Julia "Butterfly" Hill.</strong>    </p>        <p>      On December 10, 1997 Julia "Butterfly" Hill scaled "Luna,"      a 1,000-year-old California redwood tree that was in danger      of being included in a massive clear-cut by Pacific Lumber,      a division of the Maxam Corporation. And while "tree sits"      have become the norm for environmental activists looking      for a drastic way to put an end to clear cuts in old growth      forests, Hill's determination has been the object of      inspiration for environmentalists and frenzied derision for      loggers. For over two years (738 days), Hill did not come      down from her 180-foot-high perch. She repelled everything      from helicopters to El Nino to personal doubt, and her      resilience garnered worldwide attention for the      preservation of the planet's endangered wood.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Kristina Mastrocola</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>SAM MARTIN FOR MOTHER:</strong> <strong>You are      amazingly busy these days. How are you adjusting to the new      life of a public spokesperson?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JULIA BUTTERFLY HILL:</strong> Well, nothing has      changed since I was in the tree, other than that now I'm      going all over the place. I've been a spokesperson for a      long time. The only difference is that instead of being      able to do it all from one spot, now I have to go around      everywhere.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>What was a typical      February or March day for you and Luna?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Well, the Februarys and Marches I was      up there were completely different. One year was El Nino      and one was La Nina. One had excessive amounts of wind and      rain and the other excessive amounts of snow. They both bad      a lot of sleet and hail.    </p>        <p>      Julia's home for 738 days was this small treetop tent,      subjected to constant wind, rain and snow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>Did you ever get      frightened or discouraged because of the weather?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Well, the first winter frightened me      out of my mind - but it wasn't just the weather. I was      sitting in an active logging area and the [logging] company      was doing everything they could to get me down. I was also      going through personal dilemmas, so the first few months      were probably the most brutal and difficult of all. After      that I started settling in and learning how to just      <em>be.</em> And in that process, which a lot of people      spend time in Yoga learning how to do, I was able to handle      the next winter and the next hardships a little easier. It      never got easy, but I certainly learned ways of breezing      through the difficulties. And of course, there were many      times I felt discouraged and a lot of times where I was      crying, thinking <em>I'm one human being, I</em> <em>can't      take anymore, I can't do anymore.</em> But then I would      look and see the beauty of the forest and I would see the      destruction of the forest, and I would remember why I was      up there. That kept me going.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>There's a passage in your      book that I particularly like. It had to do with the first      winter, and the wind was blowing so hard that you thought      you might get blown off your platform. But you eventually      stopped fighting it and decided to bend with the storm and      the tree. Did you learn some life lessons when you were up      in the tree, and do you use them when you face new      challenges?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Absolutely. But I knew that was going      to be my biggest challenge. One time, before I came down, I      was holding Luna and crying and praying and asking myself,      <em>how will 1 hold this heart center when the world is      trying to pull me in a billion different directions? How am      I going to hold on to the lessons I've learned from this      perspective when I'm no longer in this perspective?</em>      It's a beautiful challenge, because in the challenge is a      continuation of proving to people that it is possible. This      heart center is so deep within me that I know it to be      true. And it's not something that a teacher has to teach me      or a politician has to tell me is legal or scientist has to      tell me it's scientifically possible. It is a truth that I      know to the very depth of my core.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>Do you look forward to      getting back to a more simple, less publicized way of      life?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Well, I am definitely planning to do      next year a little differently than I've done this year.      I'm learning as I go. One of the things my book doesn't      mention is that I have a business background. I graduated      high school when I was 16, then I went straight into      college and majored in business. I opened my first business      when I was 18, sold it when I was 20 and started setting up      systems to run other people's businesses for them. I was      totally in that world of money and things and money and      things. [The problem was] it was never enough. In the tree      I realized that the more stuff we have, the more stuff we      need to take care of our stuff. I always use the example of      a car because a majority of the people in this country, and      even in the world, who have cars take better care of them      than they do the earth. And yet to have a car you have to      have registration, you have to have a license, you have to      have fuel in the car, you have to have fluid in the car,      you have to have good tires and good belts, and the screws      and bolts all have to be tightened down. Before you know      it, a huge portion of your time, energy and money goes into      taking care of one thing called a car. So I keep my life      simple. I have one mug that I bring with me everywhere I      go.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>Do you support any kind of      for estry? Selective logging, for instance?</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> I absolutely support sustainable      forestry. And the reason is that - I'll use my business      background here for a moment - everyone in the business      world that you talk to knows that a wise long term      investment is one where you put in a strong initial      capital, then you only draw off the interest. Now, if you      talk to corporations that are in [it] for the short term,      they want to extract it all out and move on to the next      one. The earth - in a healthy, natural state - is a very      strong capital investment. The reality is, we've been      blessed to live on a planet that supplies our needs. But in      order to meet those needs, we have to take from the earth.      That's part of our symbiotic function. If you see any      predator species in the wild, they actually play a      symbiotic role. When they get out of control, they go      extinct. It's the same thing with us as human beings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>What was the deal that      prompted you to come out of the tree?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH</strong> : A deal was struck [with Maxam      Corporation] on December 17, 1999 after nearly 10 months of      negotiation in which they agreed to just protect Luna. They      said, Okay Julia, we'll protect the tree, come down and      leave - us alone." And I said, "Well the tree's not going      to stand in a clear-cut by itself. You need to protect the      buffer around it that I've been physically able to protect      by being here." That's when I asked for the 200-foot      radius. There is a typo in the book that says 20 feet, but      it's 200 feet. It was the amount [of surrounding trees]      that I was able to physically protect [by sitting in Luna].      So then they said they wanted $50,000 to protect the zone      around it, and I asked them to donate it to their workers      because their workers had recently been laid off [due to]      their horrific logging practices. They ended up donating it      to a college.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>It must have been an      emotional time for you to touch ground again.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> On December 18 I touched the ground      because they'd agreed to protect Luna in that buffer zone      forever. Even if governments pass laws, and even if people      buy and sell the land, this agreement that we made is      basically like a law. The deal is like a conservation      easement that runs with the land so no one may ever go in      there and cut it again. So no, [coming down] wasn't      difficult. In my mind, it wasn't done until it was done.      And unfortunately because [the agreement] had been leaked      out to the public, everyone was watching. We were going to      sign the agreement on the very last minute of the afternoon      on that Friday so that it wouldn't go onto public record      until Monday. That would have given me the weekend to turn      off my phone, turn off my pager and say goodbye. But for      some reason they ended up signing it earlier than that and      of course the press immediately picked up on it and people      were going crazy. I mean, it was a really intense time. I      had to come down the <em>very next morning.</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>What do you mean "people      were going crazy?"</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Well, because of what I've done while      I was in the tree, part of the world wanted me to stay up      there forever until all of the world's forests were saved,      or at least all of the redwoods. And part of the world      wanted me to come down, and part of the world wanted me      dead. All three components of that just went nuts in their      own way. And I didn't want to come down the tree to 2,000      people. I wanted to come down to a group of hand-picked      individuals because I knew it would be intense.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>And is that what actually      ended up happening?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Yeah, but that's because I came down      the very next morning. They posted security guards at the      base of the tree because there were threats to my life.      There were a lot of people at the base of the hill, but at      the bottom of the tree was just the group of people that I      chose to be there.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>What was it like coming      down? It must have been an incredible moment for you after      two years.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Yes, the moment I touched the ground      I literally felt like I was being electrocuted. I was      electrocuted when I was a little girl, and I know what it      feels like. Part of me was filled with ecstatic joy. I was      on the ground again! I could touch it and kiss it, which is      the first thing I did. I kneeled and kissed the ground.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>Did you take a hot bath      after that?</strong> JBH: Well, I walked barefoot for three      miles back down the mountain that I had walked up 738 days      before ...straight into a press conference with hundreds of      television cameras and photographers and radio and      newspapers. And then I got in a car, which was really      intense [laughs] and I drove to a little cabin out in the      woods, where I strategized with my team because we were      getting on a plane the next morning to go to New York to do      press.    </p>        <p>      "The moment I touched ground, I literally felt like I was      being electrocuted."<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>So what's next for you?      Are you planning other projects?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> One of the best things I can do with      my time is to share that energy and that spotlight that      surrounds me with groups who deserve to have it or who      aren't getting it. February 1 [2000] was the formal      eviction notice by the government for the Navajo's to leave      Big Mountain [in Arizona] and I was there with them      standing in solidarity and doing press.    </p>    <p>      I did a lot of workshops and presentations at colleges to      get young people to go down there. I've helped protect two      more [tree] groves by doing events that bring in community      and raise money. I'm going to Maine in a few days to try      and help push through the Maine Woods Initiative, [which is      meant to protect] a beautiful area of for est and lakes      that's in danger of being privatized and developed. Here in      the redwoods I'm continuing to do a lot of things. I helped      raise money to make people aware that we're working on a      people's initiative to protect the old growth here because      our governor and our legislature keeps selling us out. So,      you know, I'm just doing, doing, doing, doing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>I</strong> <strong>think      your biggest accomplishment by sitting in the tree has been      to let people know that it's still possible for one person      to stand up to huge industries. Do you have any advice for      those of us who simply can't live in a tree for two years      but want to preserve what we think is important to      us?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Yes. The first thing is living      simply. It's all fine and dandy to stomp our feet and point      our fingers at corporations, but if we're buying their      products and buying into their game then we're helping them      continue. The second thing I always ask people when they      ask what they can do is `what do you <em>love</em> to do?'      Because if you find a way to use what you love to do for      the causes you care about, then you last forever. And you      find a strength for when the times are hard. An example...      say you're an artist. Find other artists who are      like-minded and hold gallery events where you highlight a      cause of concern to you, whether it's the forest or the      nuclear plants or ending genetically modified food and      herbicides and pesticides in our food and in our clothing.      Do your art show, have speakers, have videos, have stories      written by each artist on the wall about why they care.      Have addresses to your local representatives there on      tables with sample letters so that people can write about      this concern, and all of a sudden you're raising community      support. These are the kinds of things that spark people's      interests and that have longevity. And these are the kind      of things that anyone can do.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <strong>Thank you so much for your      time. Best of luck.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>JBH:</strong> Thanks so much.    </p>    <p>      <em>In the last week of November 2000, uniden</em>      <em>tified vandals cut a potentially fatal gash in</em>      <em>Luna. Efforts to save the now world-famous</em>      <em>redwood are ongoing.</em>    </p>
