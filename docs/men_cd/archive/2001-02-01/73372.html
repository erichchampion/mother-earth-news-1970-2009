                        <p>      <strong>The evening star looks for daylight in front of the      Sun.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Venus is always the brightest heavenly light after the sun      and moon, but in February 2001 the planet will shine more      brightly than usual and be visible for several hours after      sunset. It will be so bright that you may be able to see it      before sunset each night, and in the dark countryside, this      bright planet will cast shadows on clear, moonless      evenings.    </p>    <p>      In March, Venus will come around to the near side of its      orbit toward Earth while also approaching our line of sight      with the sun. This means that Venus will set progressively      earlier each day. On March 1, Venus will disappear from      view about three hours after sunset. But by March 22 Venus      will set just 40 minutes after the sun. On March 30, Venus      will set in tandem with the sun and pass just north of it;      from that day on, the planet will rise well before the sun      and be visible in the dawn sky.    </p>    <p>      If viewed through a small telescope or quality binoculars,      Venus's departure from the evening sky in March can be all      the more exciting. With optical aid you'll see an      ever-longer but thinner crescent. (As the planet nears our      line of sight with the sun we see more of its night side.)      For more information on the chances of seeing Venus before      sunrise and after sunset on the same day or of viewing the      ashen light on the planet's night side, see the March issue      of <em>Sky & Telescope</em> magazine, also available on      the Web at <em>www.skypub.com .</em>    </p>
