                    <p>      <em>Are home filters a magic bullet in allergy relief, or      an expensive sugar pill?</em><br />    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Barry Chalofsky    </h5>                <p>      The dilemma is that indoor air pollution can be up to ten      times greater than levels found outdoors. Such close      proximity to dust mites, pet dander, mold, bacteria and      mildew, along with outdoor allergens like grasses, weeds      and pollen, can make your refuge nothing but a ruse.    </p>    <p>      There are three methods that help to control indoor      pollution: source control, ventilation and air cleaning.      Source control (removing the source of the allergens) is      the most cost-effective; unfortunately, not all pollutants      can be identified or eliminated. Pet dander, for instance,      is one of the most prevalent sources of indoor pollution,      but getting rid of Fido is more than most pet owners can      bear. Ventilation (bringing outside air inside) helps, but      most of us don't live in a climate where leaving the      windows open year-round is an option. In addition, leaving      the windows open allows outside allergens to enter the      house. But cleaning the air with filters, even though it's      more costly than the other two methods, is probably the      best way to reduce the allergens in your house. Combine all      three methods and you'll breathe easier.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        <strong>A</strong>Honeywell's Quiet Care air cleaner with        HEPA filter is designed to be barely audible ($154).        <strong>B</strong>Vornado purifiers use True HEPA filters        and PreSorb prefilters. With flat backs, they stand out        of the way, against a wall ($199). <strong>C</strong>        Bionaire purifiers use an ULPA filter (about $200).        <strong>D</strong> The Sharper Image Ionic Breeze ($250)        circulates air electronically and silently.        <strong>E</strong> Precisionaire EZ Flow Filter ($1) and        <strong>F</strong> 3M Filtrete 1000 Filter ($15) are for        central heat and air units.      </p>    </div>    <h3>      FILTER FUNCTIONS    </h3>    <p>      There are three general types of filters: mechanical, ion      generators and electronic air cleaners. In addition, there      are "hybrid" systems that combine mechanical, ion and/or      electronic features.    </p>    <p>      Mechanical filters are the models found in most homes with      central heating and/or air conditioning. They are also      found in portable fan-forced units and serve as register      covers where an air duct enters a room. The standard      mechanical filter is a flat filter that contains coarse      fibers (typically fiberglass, aluminum or synthetic      material) held in place with a cardboard or plastic frame.      Other models use an "electret" media, which is a      permanently charged plastic film or fiber. A third type is      a panel filter, which has a pleated or an extended surface.    </p>        <p>      Generally, mechanical filters are efficient at collecting      large particles, but remove a small percentage of smaller      particles (the panel filter is somewhat more efficient at      small-particle capture). With mechanical filters, the more      dense the filter material or the greater the filter surface      area, the better it will remove pollutants. Whole-house      mechanical filters, at $1 to $15 each, are a bargain in the      air-cleaner world, but they are also the least effective,      stopping only 10% to 40% of pollutants. They also need to      be replaced on a monthly or bimonthly basis.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Electronic air cleaners are the most efficient      cleaners of indoor air, removing up to 95% of dirt, dust      and smoke.</strong>    </p>        <p>      I on generators, which come as portable units only, use      electrostatic charges to remove particles from indoor air.      The charged particles in a room are then attracted to      walls, floors, tabletops, draperies and occupants, which      often results in a noticeable accumulation of soot. In some      cases, these devices contain a collector to attract the      charged particles back to the unit. They may also have a      fan and mechanical filter. Ion generators take second place      in the price hierarchy, at $50 to $150 apiece, but you      usually need a unit for each room. Also most systems      require either filter replacement or periodic cleaning.      They can remove 25% to 94% of the pollutants.    </p>    <p>      Electronic air cleaners use an electrical field like a      powerful magnet to trap charged particles. Whole-house air      cleaners are most often installed in house ducts between      the cold air return and the fan, but they can also be in      portable units with fans. Electronic air cleaners are      usually either electrostatic precipitators or charged-media      filters. Electrostatic precipitators collect particles on a      series of flat plates, or cells, enclosed in a metal frame.      There are nonelectronic electrostatic precipitator filters,      but these are not as effective. Charged-media filters, on      the other hand, collect the particles on the fibers in a      filter.    </p>    <p>      Electronic air cleaners are the most efficient cleaners of      indoor air, removing up to 95% of dirt, dust and smoke.      They are also the most expensive, ranging in cost from $150      to $600, with some units costing upwards of $1,000. One big      advantage to electronic air cleaners is that they can be      reused almost indefinitely, needing only to be washed in      the dishwasher or tub.    </p>    <p>      Finally, hybrid filters - those that combine all three      types of cleaners - may be whole-house or portable, and can      combine different methods such as mechanical filters and      passive electrostatic filters. These can range in price      from $50 to $200 and often require expensive filter      replacements on a periodic basis. Their effectiveness      varies depending on the combination of filters.    </p>    <h3>      HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THEY?    </h3>    <p>      No air cleaning system can remove all pollutants from      indoor air. In addition, there are no uniform standards for      comparing systems, although most filters are tested and      given an ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration      and Air-Conditioning Engineers) rating (see " Do They Work?      " <em>).</em> Portable filters are sometimes given a Clean      Air Delivery Rate (CADR) by the Association of Home      Appliance Manufacturers (ARAM). This refers to the rate at      which air is moved through the filter, measured in cubic      feet per minute. In both ratings, the higher the number,      the better.    </p>    <p>      Under the right conditions, the better filters can      effectively remove many household pollutants. In addition,      air cleaners may also contain absorbents (charcoal) and/or      reactive materials to remove cigarette smoke and odors.      Ozone generators designed to eliminate odors and kill      bacteria are becoming increasingly popular, but, curiously,      ozone in sufficient quantities is itself a pollutant and      can cause shortness of breath and chest pain if allowed to      accumulate. It is also important to understand that air      cleaners cannot remove pollutants such as dust, dander and      pollen once they settle. Another important consideration is      that whole-house air cleaners usually only work when the      heater/air conditioner is on; therefore, you may not have      air cleaning when the temperature is mild.    </p>    <h3>      PORTABLE FILTERS VERSUS WHOLE HOUSE FILTERS    </h3>    <p>      All filter materials come in either a portable or whole      house system - if you don't have a forced-air heating      system, you are limited to the portable kind. Portables are      generally cheaper than whole-house units, costing $80 to      $500 depending on the size of the room you're filtering.      They can be focused in high-risk areas such as the bedroom      or living room. Look for units that have a "high-efficiency      particulate air (HEPA) filter" or an "ultra-low penetration      air (ULPA) filter." These filters work well for removing      dust and smoke. Brand names, which include Honeywell,      Panasonic, Holmes, Hunter and Kenmore, are available from a      large variety of retail stores.    </p>    <p>      Whole-house air cleaners, on the other hand, filter      <em>all</em> of the air in your house (as long as the      windows are closed) and they can vary in price from as      little as $1 to as much as a $1,000 with installation. A      good, pleated electrostatic filter that replaces the      ordinary fiberglass filters standard in most central      heating units can provide reasonably good filtration for a      very small price, about $10 to $15 (these filters must be      changed periodically). It's important to note that washable      electrostatic filters may not work as well as replaceable      ones. For the most effective cleaning of indoor pollutants,      however, you will probably need to spend at least $400 for      an electronic precipitator unit. Brand names include      Honeywell, Research Products, 3M, Purolator, Precisionaire      and American Air Filter. While consumers can easily install      small filters, larger units generally require a heating      contractor, which may add significantly to the cost.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Some so-called "personal" or "micro" air      cleaners... may promise "sparkling clean air" or even an      "increase in your energy level." These claims are unproven      and probably false.</strong>    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        FOR MORE INFORMATION ON <strong>Allergies & Allergy        Control</strong>      </p>      <p>        The US Environmental Protection<br />        Agency: www.epa.gov/iaq<br />        The Air Conditioning & Refrigeration Institute:        www.ari.org .<br />        The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology:        www.aaaai.org The Association of Home Appliance<br />        Manufacturers: www.aham.org<br />        ( www.cadr.org for air filters specifically) The American        Society of Heating,<br />        Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning<br />        Engineers: www.ashrae.org      </p>    </div>    <h3>      MISLEADING CLAIMS    </h3>    <p>      Since the business is not well-regulated, you will run into      a lot of hype, including questionable products and claims.      Some so-called "personal" or "micro" air cleaners (small      individual cleaners that you wear or put on your desk), may      promise "sparkling clean air" or even an "increase in your      energy level" in exchange for $50 to $200. Don't bet on it.      Simply put, machines with a tiny CADR will have a tinier      effect on the air you breathe.    </p>    <p>      That said, not even the massive units can provide complete      protection from airborne pollutants. Nevertheless,      electronic air cleaners, although initially expensive, are      probably the best bet over the long run. If you have      allergies during the spring or fall, you may want to      supplement a whole-house air cleaner with a portable in      your bedroom, since your heater or air conditioner will not      be running enough during these times. The bottom line? In      concert with source control and ventilation, air cleaners      can be an effective weapon in the fight against      allergies.<br />    </p>    <p>      Related info:<br />      A Fair Exchange<br />      10 Tips to Attack The Source<br />      Do They Work?    </p>
