                                <p>      Growing beans on tipis is a great way to maximize your      growing space. While beans, peas, gourds or other vinous      plants grow up along the tipi poles, you can plant      semihardy crops, such as lettuce, in the space underneath.      The shade from the vines keeps the undercrop cool, which      can extend its season by as much as three weeks, depending      on your USDA zone.    </p>    <p>      You can make the poles from any material you like - bamboo      to fiberglass. I prefer to make my own from scrap lumber,      ripping it into 3/4" squares the length of the wood. The      poles should be at least 7' long, but this will vary      depending on the height requirements of your plants.      Between 8' to 10' are the best all around sizes.    </p>    <p>      For each tipi you'll need six stakes and about two yards of      twine.    </p>    <p>      1 Mark three of the stakes 18" to 20" from the top. 2 Lay      them out on the ground, with the two outside stakes on the      left and the middle one on the right. Line up the marks. 3      Tie the twine to one of the outside stakes and weave it      over and under all the stakes at least twice. Now, draw the      woven line tight after wrapping the twine around the woven      cord between each set of stakes. Do this at least twice and      <em>pull tight</em> . 4 Tie off the twine. 5 Stand the unit      up and spread the legs evenly the width of your bed      (normally 30" to 36"). 6 Fit the remaining poles around the      standing unit. 7 Wrap the balance of the twine around all      six stakes where they cross, pulling as tightly as you can,      and tie off on one of the original stakes.    </p>        <p>      You can topjoin a row of tipis by laying a stake across      them. If you go this route, leave enough twine to tie the      top stake to the standing unit.    </p>
