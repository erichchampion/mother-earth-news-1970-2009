                        <p>      Your average apple doesn't come with an ingredients list,      but if it did, you'd need a degree in chemistry to read it.      <em>Azinphos-methyl,</em> <em>carbaryl, chlorpyrifos,</em>      <em>endosulfan, thiabendazole:</em> these are just a few of      the dozens of pesticides detected on red, raw apples by the      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of its ongoing      Total Diet Study (TDS). Four times a year the FDA goes      shopping, buying multiple samples of 261 different food      items from supermarkets, grocery stores and fast-food      restaurants in alternating geographic regions. Like foods      are combined, prepared for the table, then analyzed for      pesticide residues, radionucleotides, industrial chemicals      and other toxic elements.    </p>    <p>      Items range from produce, meats and milk to tacos, tuna      casserole and commercial chocolate chip cookies. Not      surprisingly, fruits and vegetables rank first as the most      chemically treated commodities. Perhaps more unexpected is      the fact that DDT is the most frequently detected      poison-found in a whopping 22% of the foods tested in 1999      - despite a 25-year ban on its use in the U.S. While this      notorious organochlorine is still used by some foreign      nations, mainly for mosquito control, FDA and EPA officials      attribute the prevalence of DDT and its metabolites in our      food largely to the pesticide's resilience. Today's crops      continue to absorb the remains of the 1,350,000,000 pounds      of DDT dumped on U.S. soil during the past 30 years.    </p>    <p>      The fag.. , another banned organochlorine, shows up in      about 14% of our food is further proof of the staying power      of these persistent organic pollutants.    </p>    <p>      Rounding out the top-five offender list are endosulfan, one      of only three still legal organochlorines (it comes up for      review this year), and two organophosphates:      chlorpyrifosmethyl and malathion (see " Chemical Roulette "      for more on these pesticides).    </p>    <p>      In all, 55 pesticides were found in the FDA's 1999 "market      baskets," though all were reportedly well below regulatory      limits. Current tests can detect residues at 1 part per      billion.    </p>    <p>      Even so, some fruits and veggies stand out for both the      variety and sheer number of residues found in their flesh      and on their skins. The top ten, in descending order of      contamination and based do TDS data for the years 1991      through 1999, are:    </p>    <p>      1.Apples<br />      2.Collards<br />      3.Green peppers and spinach (tie)<br />      4.Peaches 5.Celery<br />      6.Strawberries<br />      7.Tomatoes<br />      8. White potatoes<br />      9.Cucumbers<br />      10. Sweet cherries    </p>    <p>      In addition to its Total Diet Study, the FDA also regularly      monitors both imported and domestic food items for residue      before they enter the market to be sure that producers,      both at home and abroad, are complying with pesticide      limits set by the EPA. In 1999, the FDA detected pesticide      residues on nearly 40% of the domestic foods and 35% of the      foreign items tested, though all but about 4% were within      EPA safety standards.    </p>    <p>      Detailed results of the FDA's residue monitoring and market      basket studies are available on the Web at      http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov .    </p>
