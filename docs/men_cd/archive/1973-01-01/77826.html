            			    <p>      Like most other temperate fruit, plums need to be      winter-chilled in order to bear. They can be grown in just      about any part of the United States where winter      temperatures fall below 40°F. for a few weeks but not      below-25°F. for the same period of time.    </p>    <p>      As usual, select a locally adapted variety, bearing in mind      that prune plums will be needed if you want to make a lot      of prunes. Regular plums can be dried too, but they have to      be pitted and halved . . . their sugar content is not high      enough to preserve them without fermentation.    </p>    <h3>STOCK</h3>    <p>      You will need at least two varieties, since most plums are      self-sterile. All plums are root-grafted, which means on a      one-year-old tree you'll be getting solid two- or      three-year-old rootstock. Plant in fall if the winters in      your area are mild enough so that temperatures do not go      below the teens except on very rare occasions. Spring      planting is fine as long as the tree is completely dormant,      but fall planting is better where possible.    </p>    <p>      Space the trees fifteen to thirty feet apart, depending on      the mature size of your particular species. Plum bark is      sensitive to sun-scald (to a tree what a sunburn is to      people), so wrap a couple of layers of burlap around the      lower part of the trunk. Cut the wood back by 25 percent      when you plant.    </p>    <h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      Pruning is mostly confine to shaping a wide, open,      spreading tree, and, of course, regular maintenance      trimming. Once fruiting begins, you may have to support      some of the bearing branches like those of your peach      trees. Eliminating overbearing by selectively removing      small, unripe fruit will also be necessary. Keep all      pruning cuts clean and, if possible, seal them over with      pitch to protect against heart rot.    </p>   <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      As with cherries, birds can be a menace. Try a mulberry      hedge around your orchard. Birds simply love mulberries,      and they will often stop at the hedge and fill themselves      up before they ever reach your fruit.    </p>   <h3> HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      Harvest plums when fully ripe for eating, just a little      before for canning. Prune varieties should be allowed to      ripen till they drop . . . into a cheesecloth trampoline      you have suspended beneath the tree. Remove fallen fruit      daily and sun-dry on screen trays, turning occasionally. If      it's rainy, oven-dry in single layers for six hours at      110° F.    </p>
