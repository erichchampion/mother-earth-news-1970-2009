                    <h3>THE OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, CHAPTER 7<br />        PLANT MANAGEMENT - ROW CROPS</h3><div class="sidebar">      <h3>KEN KERN</h3>    <p>      Ken Kern author of THE OWNER-BUILT HOME and THE OWNER-BUILT      HOMESTEAD, is an amazing fellow and everyone interested in      decentralist, backto-the-land, rational living should know      of his work. Back in 1948 he began collecting information      on low-cost, simple and natural construction materials and      techniques. He combed the world for ideas, tried them and      started writing about his experiments.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's      articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN REVOLUTION.      Ken has also issued a three-year series of pieces (called      TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun pit design of his      has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.    </p>    <p>      This series of Ken Kern's work is being taken both from      OWNER-BUILT HOME (already published) and OWNER-BUILT      HOMESTEAD (to be published). To give you advance chapters      of HOMESTEAD as they are written I have to break my      presentation of HOME on an irregular basis for which I      apologize. If you want HOME all at once it's available      right now direct from Ken Kern, Sierra Route, Oakhurst,      California 93644 for $10.00.    </p>    <p>      -MOTHER<br />    </p>		</div>    <p>      <em>You ask me to plough the ground. Shall I take a knife      and tear my mother's bosom? Then when I die she will not      take me to her bosom to rest. You ask me to dig for stones!      Shall I dig under her skin for bones? Then when I die I      cannot enter her body to be born again. You ask me to cut      grass and make hay and sell it and be rich like white men.      But how dare I cut my mother's hair?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><em>Nevada Chief Smohalla's reply to<br />      agricultural directives from Washington</em></em>    </p>    <p>      <br />    </p>    <p>      The photo on the following page was taken by Richard St.      Barbe Baker, leader of the 1952 Sahara University      Expedition. It is an aerial view of a Bedouin encampment in      the Libyan Desert. In better times this land was heavily      forested, later to be cleared and tilled to provide grain      for Rome. As Mr. Baker observes, "An iron plow is a      dangerous implement, because it loosens the earth to a      considerable depth, allowing the soil to be washed away in      the first torrential downpour." In equatorial regions,      especially, the clearing away of extensive areas for the      production of row crops, such as corn or cotton, leads to      certain disaster . . . even to the decline and fall of      otherwise thriving civilizations.    </p>    <p>      Actually there is only <em>one</em> remaining ancient      row-crop-based civilization: the Chinese. This fact rather      impressed a University of Wisconsin soil scientist. In 1910      Professor F.H. King determined to study firsthand the row      crop farming methods of the Chinese. His delightful travel      book, <em>FARMERS OF FORTY CENTURIES,</em> appeared the      following year. In it King describes the tilling,      fertilizing and planting techniques that have enabled      survival (and even improvements in soil structure and      fertility) throughout these many centuries. Even before his      trip to the Orient, maverick King found little acceptance      to his theories of <em>minimum tillage</em> . . . which he      pronounced in 1890. When he later gave credence to the use      of human excrement as a row crop fertilizer, his colleagues      discredited him completely. Professor King was perhaps the      foremost soil scientist of his time, and <em>FARMERS OF      FORTY CENTURIES</em> is the most important book on food      production . . . yet it is not even listed in the      Department of Agriculture's bibliography of 500 important      books on soil management <em>(SOILS AND MEN,</em> Yearbook,      1938).    </p>    <p>      Chinese row crop production methods are not presented here      as the final word. Rather, their sensitive regard for      <em>fertilizing, tillage</em> and <em>planting</em>      establishes a neat basis for discussing pre-modern and      post-modern row cropping techniques.    </p>    <p>      Traditionally, the Chinese till their row crops to a very      minor extent. Mainly, they broadcast legumes such as      soybeans or cereals among row crops . . . when the plants      reach a few inches tall they are worked into the soil with      a hoe. The Chinese realize that <em>young</em> green      manures are best for feeding microbe populations. Soil will      soon lose its crumb structure following the cultivation of      annual crops, and must be replenished by a system which      permits an accumulation in the soil of active humus capable      of cementing the soil into crumbs. Instinctively, the      Chinese had a concept of growing <em>space</em> which we      would do well to understand and appreciate . . . one might      call this space the <em>humosphere,</em> the vital, most      active upper-six-inches of the soil. It is in this zone      that 80% of the organic matter is concentrated. Antibiotics      are also produced in the humosphere by aerobiotic      microorganisms, and tillage buries and asphyxiates these      sensitive microbe populations.    </p>    <p>      There is also a substantial loss of nitrogen when the soil      is tilled. The tillage process suffocates organic matter      and at the same time introduces excessive oxidation into      the soil structure. Ordinarily the oxidation process is      slow . . . which allows the ammonium salts to produce an      intermediate ammonium nitrate stage before finally breaking      up into nitrogen and water. Ammonium nitrate is an unstable      (even explosive!) substance and readily      dissipated-wasted-to the atmosphere in      conditions of excessive oxidation.    </p>        <p>      Professor Yarwood, plant pathologist at University of      California, points out that the food production per unit      area of land increases 6,000 times as a result of tillage.      This is of course good news to agribusiness mentalities,      who select crops specifically for big yields. But big yield      production reduces the power of the plant to manufacture      protein. Also, big crop yields reduce the protection      against microbe and virus invasion. Yarwood mentions that      of 20 fungal pathogens, 12 were more severe on tilled      plants. Concurrent with increase in crop production since      1926, the number of recorded diseases of principal crops      increased threefold. Yarwood counted 659 different diseases      found in conventionally tilled crops, and 374 in untitled      "native" plants.    </p>    <p>      In a few years, perhaps the concept of "zero tillage" will      be more widely circulated throughout agricultural circles.      Major advancements are now coming from England and Germany,      for the development of new machinery and mulch-planting      techniques. At the agricultural university in the      Netherlands, a special "Tillage Department" has been formed      to do research on herbicides and non-soil-compactive      machinery. The Dutch reason that herbicides can very      readily replace tillage, as the traditional purpose of      plowing and cultivating is to eliminate competitive weed      growth.    </p>        <p>      Most of the significant progress in zero tillage has been      done during wartime . . . when power sources are low and      food requirements high. The Spanish-American War no doubt      influenced Professor King's minimum tillage approach. At      the time of the First World War, Professor Hollack in      Germany published his no-plow arguments the same way that      Faulkner did in 1943 <em>(PLOWMAN'S FOLLY).</em> A      three-year research on minimum tillage was conducted during      the early years of World War II at Rothansted Agricultural      Station in England. And in Vienna, Viktor Schauberger made      his claims against the plow that is moved at a fast rate      through the soil. Electrical disturbances supposedly occur      which destroy essential trace elements. The      modern-peacetime-exponent of zero tillage is,      of course, Ruth Stout. As with Faulkner, none of her books      are even hinted at in scientific publications, due possibly      to the frivolity of her presentation.    </p>    <p>      Ruth Stout has successfully popularized mulch planting      among organic gardener circles. She also represents a      viable-though nonscientific-position against      the use of fertilizers and manures. Fertilization with      mineral nutrients (NPK) is of course responsible for      tremendous crop yields. But as Professor Yarwood reminds      us, increased crop yields bring increased disease. A      concentration of fertilizer is far less desirable than a      minimum <em>balance</em> of nutrients. Excessive quantities      of nitrogen, for instance, promote wilt disease by      providing better nourishment for the parasite.    </p>    <p>      The value of manure as a mulch is far greater than as a      fertilizer. The humus that manure supplies improves soil      structure by increasing its capacity to take in and hold      water. Soil moisture is retained by shading, the      evaporation is minimized, aeration increased and the      biological activities of microorganisms are augmented.    </p>    <p>      Professor King reports that the Chinese      <em>manufacture</em> their fertilizers in the form of earth      composts. Dwelling walls and floors and village walks are      periodically dug up and composted for use in their fields      and gardens. And, of course, the use of night soil is      common throughout the Orient.    </p>    <p>      Intensive row crop planting techniques developed by the      Chinese would be difficult to improve upon. They hold      advanced concepts of intercropping, successive planting,      rotation planting and companion growing. Basically, the      Chinese believe that <em>diversification is      fundamental.</em> Different crops are grown together, to      permit the different root systems to thrive . . . the      shallow feeders, deep feeders and intermediate-level      feeders. Professor King noted that as many as three crops      occupy the same field in successive rows, all in different      stages of maturity. One field has a crop of winter wheat      nearly mature, a crop of beans about two-thirds mature and      a crop of cotton newly planted.    </p>    <p>      In some instances, intercropping is used when one crop is      grown and cleared off the ground before the main crop      requires the room to itself. Radishes or lettuce are often      intercropped with carrots . . . the latter being the main      crop. Endive can be sown three weeks prior to the main crop      of cauliflower. An early, or incidental, crop is often      referred to as a <em>catch crop.</em>    </p>    <p>      There are both "early" and "late" <em>varieties</em> of the      same <em>species</em> of crop. Early means the crop matures      in fewer days. And of course individual species of row      crops mature at different times. Cabbage, for instance,      requires 90 days where lettuce needs 50 days and radishes      only 30 days. Many combinations of earlylate plantings have      been worked out: spring spinach followed by Brussels      sprouts, beans or tomatoes; late peas followed by a late      planting of corn; early peas followed by cabbage, tomatoes      or by a planting of strawberries for next year's bed.    </p>        <p>      Chinese row crop production maintains a constant and even      growth. Crops are sown successively, so they ripen as they      are needed; and when a crop is harvested, another one is      transplanted to take its place . . . a plant is never      allowed to stop growing. The Chinese make good use of      nursery beds . . . where winter and spring crops can be      started a month or so earlier. Also, stronger and more      uniform plants can be grown in a controlled nursery bed      situation. A suggested companion cropping sequence is      illustrated on the following page.    </p>    <p>      Rudolf-Steiner, founder of the bio-dynamic gardening      approach, maintained that permanent <em>raised</em> beds      increased the growth activity on their surface. His      esoteric arguments for raised beds are not clear to me, but      there are obvious practical advantages: such beds insure      maximum use of the planting space. The first principle of      intensive gardening is uni <em>formity of space.</em> Flats      and frames should be built to an interchangeable module, so      that they can be moved from any one part of the garden to      any other part when needed. A four-foot-wide module with      bed length of 16 feet seems to be the most practical size.      Paths have to be provided between the six-inch-high beds.    </p>    <p>      In medieval Europe, monks grew vegetables, herbs, flowers,      berries and fruit trees altogether, for mutual benefit. The      Chinese hold a near-religious sentiment against sameness      and uniformity. They feel that monoculture is a wrong row      crop gardening approach because pure stands are not found      in nature. Monoculture makes for an efficient      truck-gardening operation but it favors disease. The      greater the variety of planting, the less likelihood of      insect infestation buildup. Where a rich variety of plants      make up a biological community, that community has a better      chance of remaining stable. Crop rotation and crop      combinations are the best ways to achieve a balanced plant      community. It is based on variations in species . . .      plants of the cabbage family (cabbage, cauliflower,      broccoli, radish, turnip, etc.), for instance, should not      be grown in the same location.    </p>        <p>      Plants should also be grown relative to the root level they      occupy in the soil, as well as to the nutrient feeding      capacity of the plant itself. Heavy feeders like the      cabbage family, tomatoes and leafy vegetables should be      followed with light feeders like carrots and beets. An      ideal rotation might be: light feeder plants, selected from      the legume family-peas or beans-would prepare      the soil for following heavy feeder rotation. Bacterial      blight can be controlled by rotating peas and beans with      cabbage. Tomatoes and potatoes are both attacked by the      same organism, so they should never be grown in the same      location each year (biodynamic theories notwithstanding) as      the verticillium-wilt organism which attacks tomatoes is      carried over in the soil. The sugar beet nematode builds up      a dense population when beets are planted in the same      location for several consecutive years.    </p>    <p>      Row crop rotation principles should be extended to include      sod crops, cover crops and animal grazing. And during the      late summer dormancy periods, one would do well to      encourage a healthy crop of <em>weeds. Do</em> mesticated      animals, as well as wild animals such as birds, frogs and      moles, should be allowed controlled access to the garden      and field crops. No better method of insect control exists.    </p>    <p>      Sir Albert Howard said that insect pests and plant disease      are mere <em>indicators</em> that farming methods are      wrong. Insects attack the weaker plants because the plants      are not suited to their environment . . . they are less      healthy in terms of their own internal protection against      microbial attack. And of course first causes of an      unhealthy plant can be traced to the unhealthy soil in      which it is grown. This fact is succinctly illustrated by      the Missouri Experiment Station:    </p>    <p>      <em>With some of our most troublesome crop pests, there is      a direct</em> <em>relation between insect numbers and soil      fertility. The less fertility,</em> <em>the more insects.      Our experience and studies over the last several</em>      <em>years have proved this. In other words, as we      over-crop, single-</em> <em>crop and permit the damage of      soil erosion, we grow more crops of</em> <em>harmful      troublesome pests than we need to have.</em>    </p>    <p>      Soil fertility is of course a prime consideration when      establishing a row crop garden location. A good rule is to      plant where weeds flourish. One should also consider wind      and frost protection, drainage and land slope, and degree      of available sunshine. Some plants, like tomatoes, will      thrive in one-half the normal sunshine. The dead shade of a      building is of course more harmful than the moving shade of      a tree.    </p>    <p>      Row crops should be located at a point immediately      accessible to the homestead cooking area. Experience in a      wide range of gardening situations have proven this to be a      very important factor . . . both from the standpoint of      occasional harvesting and occasional maintenance, home and      garden must be contiguous.    </p>    <p>      There are possibly a hundred published row crop garden      plans . . . each purporting to be the most optimum,      well-thought-out scheme. Actually it is impossible to      design a garden plan for someone else . . . site      conditions, regional climatic variations and personal food      tastes and dislikes are far too variable.    </p>    <p>      A few rules, however, may prove helpful. First, keep the      space as <em>small</em> as possible, relative to family      food need, available space and amount of time and help for      work. As an old adage has it, <em>never plow up(!) more      space than your wife can take care</em> <em>of</em> .      Second, grow plants of the very finest quality. Every      homestead family should make a <em>row crop rating      chart,</em> with each crop chosen on the basis of season,      adaptability to site, nutrition value, taste and growing      efficiency. I am including a vegetable efficiency rating      chart below. It was originally prepared to assist my wife      in the family homestead garden planning and planting chore.    </p>        <h3>THE OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, CHAPTER 5<br />        INDIVIDUAL LIVING SPACE</h3>     <p>      Under the heading of <em>individual living space</em> is      included all private and personal recreational, sleeping,      bathing, and dressing activities. Again, in matters      personal, as with family arrangements, our concern here is      not so much with "room planning" as with the various      <em>activities</em> that are pursued. The manner in which      the planning procedure should operate is as follows: First,      list the various activities in their relative importance to      social, family and personal life. Then assess the      conditions necessary for their pursuit in terms of space,      "atmosphere," efficiency, comfort, furniture, and      equipment. Next group those activities that can be carried      on together, and those that cannot-in terms of place,      frequency, time, and sequence. In short, the determination      of living requirements is based on the threefold      relationship of Space (place), Equipment (facilities and      furniture), and Atmosphere (physiological aspects, control      of heat, noise, etc.). The successful determination of      these three conditions will naturally lead to a      <em>Healthful Fnvironment.</em>    </p>    <p>      Health is man's ultimate need, and as such should become      the criterion of housing design. A dearth of research      exists on this all-important subject. The most notable      instance of work in this field has been done, of course, in      the Pioneer Health Centre at Peckham (London)-from      1926 to 1951. Doctors at Peckham practiced      <em>preventive</em> medicine and treated the <em>whole</em>      person: disease in relation to living environment. Health      is possible, they discovered, only when movement and      flexibility are not impeded. In their building design they      considered free circulation, visibility, and the flow of      space into space-all vitally important components of      the healthy environment. Hallways were eliminated-as      the whole building should function as circulation space.    </p>    <p>      The central purpose of the Peckham Experiment was to study      <em>function</em> in <em>healthy</em> man. To realize his      <em>full</em> function man must live in a fully free      environment. The open-plan and New House design concepts go      far to achieve these ends.    </p>    <p>      A more detailed building design analysis of the functions      of family living was conducted in 1941 by the Pierce      Foundation. Interesting space and motion studies were made      as well as actual field studies of families in their homes.      Family habits, attitudes, and possessions were evaluated      and physiological and psychological housing requirements      determined.    </p>    <p>      All of which leads this writer to feel that the enviromnent      where we spend more than one-third of our time is the most      neglected by designers and manufacturers. A person's living      space should offer something more than what furniture can      be crammed into a 10 X 12 sleeping-room-box.    </p>    <p>      Our personal living space should first of all be      <em>private.</em> Everyone in the family at one time during      the day or night should be able to "get away from it all."      It is therefore advisable to locate the personal living      quarters at some distance from the area for group living      activities. Besides complete separation of the two spaces,      we enjoy a contrasting architectural treatment: a sense of      change from group activity to individual activity. This is      the reason why a walk up a flight of stairs or down a long      passage to the individual living area has always held a      certain attraction to the space-sensitive person.    </p>    <p>      It is the <em>bed</em> and its activity-space that      determines the size of contemporary ""bedrooms." An area of      at least 10-feet by 10-feet is required to house a double      bed. A conventional 3-bedroom house has about 400 square      feet allocated to sleeping. This area can be reduced to      about one-half by enclosing the bed in an alcove or      compartment. This is not a new idea: Our European ancestors      used to sleep in cabinets in the Middle Ages: A modern      equivalent might be a compartment having controlled      lighting, heating, ventilation and soundproofing. Sides and      ceiling of this compartment could be lined with reflective      panels to reflect body heat, thereby eliminating the need      of confining blankets. The circulation of warm air under      the floor would supply sufficient heat if the mattress were      placed at floor level.    </p>    <p>      There are numerous advantages of sleeping close to the      floor (besides the floor-heating possibilities). Asians      have, of course, exploited floor sleeping arrangements.      Comforters, folded and stored in a closet during the day,      replace the bulky, massive bedsteads used by Western man.    </p>    <p>      There is a general consensus among New House builders that      the bathroom should lose its identity as a separate room.      It was perhaps Le Corbusier who first broke down the strict      division between bedroom and bathroom when he (in 1929)      placed the bathroom in the <em>same</em> room as the      bedroom. He felt that the bathroom should be designed as a      luxurious adornment to whatever room it occupies.    </p>    <p>      A <em>bathing lounge-complete</em> with sauna, sun      terrace and cold plunge-is presented here as the      ideal bathing arrangement. Each personal living area should      have its private sink in conjunction with the dressing      area, and a private toilet in a separate cabinet. The      bathing lounge, then, might better function as a place of      group-living activity.    </p>    <p>      There is a current trend to place laundry functions in the      bathing area. This certainly makes more sense from a      compatibility standpoint than placing it in or near the      cooking area. Most laundry comes from the nearby sleeping      area (linen and soiled clothing) and is stored there. Of      all rooms in the house the bathing area is least likely to      be upset by laundering during the normal hours for that      operation. Plumbing, hot water, and room finishes (for high      humidity) are already available in bathing areas.    </p>        <p>      Much work needs to be done in designing more accessible and      ample storage facilities for the individual living area.      One should first of all list all the items to be stored.      These items should then be grouped according to most and      least frequent use. Items which require special provision      because of weight or size should be listed separately.      Detailed closet and cabinet storage units can then be      designed.    </p>    <p>      The usual closet has much area that is almost impossible to      use because the sliding, folding, or swinging door      arrangement hampers inside visibility. A recent improvement      in wardrobe design has been the <em>shelf-door      wardrobe,</em> which provides more convenient storage      space. Closet doors should open to the complete storage      facility. Customary drawer-faced cabinets conceal inside      contents, and require the opening of many drawers to find      an article. In self-door arrangements, sliding trays make      clothes hunting easier.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of      importance)<br />      <em>HOMES FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW:</em> Great Britain      Ministry of Housing and Local Government, 1961<br />      <em>MEASURING SPACE AND MOTION:</em> John Pierce      Foundation, Research Study 6.<br />      <em>THE PECKHAM EXPERIMENT:</em> Pearse and Crocker, 1943.    </p>      <h3>THE OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, CHAPTER 6<br />          COOKING-DINING</h3>     <p>      In Chapter 4, <em>Group Living Space,</em> open planning      and flexibility concepts were discussed-concepts to      enhance and embellish space for esthetic appreciation.      Then, <em>Individual Living Space</em> design and structure      considerations stressed the need for a physically and      psychologically healthful space arrangement.    </p>    <p>      This present section on the design and structure of cooking      and dining functions likewise includes esthetic and      healthful considerations, but also some concepts that have      to do with <em>human engineering,</em> which is simply      engineering for human use. In our use of cooking      appliances, for instance, we design for optimum efficiency      (measured by the comfort, safety, accuracy and speed of the      function to be performed). The house that holds the      appliances should be designed the same way. Many      "physiological work studies" have been developed in England      and in Scandinavian countries to better determine housing      needs. Designers in these countries have gone far to      engineer equipment to meet human requirements. Their      considerations take into account: (1) the psychological      aspects conditioned by tradition and social pattern; (2)      the physical aspects of solar orientation, view, indoor      climate, air circulation and sound insulation; and (3) the      human engineering considerations that have to do with a      person's convenience arc, involving his or her height,      reach, motion pattern, and space needs.    </p>    <p>      Contrast this human engineering approach with our present      condition: a recent University of Illinois Small Homes      Council survey of over a hundred housing developments found      that 90% had inadequate base cabinet storage, 77% had too      few wall cabinets, and 67% had constricted counter space.      From the standpoint of human engineering there are five      requirements for an optimum cooking-work center: (1)      adequate activity space; (2) adequate counter space; (3)      adequate equipment space; (4) adequate storage space; (5)      an arrangement of all these areas for maximum efficiency.      Obviously, few home builders follow the necessary steps to      develop a truly efficient work center.    </p>    <p>      "Motions take time." So, in designing a cooking layout the      first question is, "Where is the best location for what?"      In answering this we first must analyze the work to be      done. For a righthanded person the cooking sequence is from      right to left: Store, mix, sink, range, serve. For each of      these areas we next determine the equipment and supplies      needed. Pieces of equipment and supplies should be arranged      in order of sequence of activities required to do the job,      and at heights related to your body and its ability to use      them in that position. Cooking research at Cornell      University established a 12-foot to 20-foot relationship      between refrigerator, sink, and range. A continuous counter      would be convenient in some respects; but from a human      engineering standpoint the sink (for the modal American      adult) should be three inches higher than the standard      (36-inch) counter height, and the mixing center should be 4      inches lower (32 inches). A physical strain occurs when a      modal worker reaches into a storage cabinet lower than 20      inches from the floor or higher than 60 inches from the      floor. Strain also occurs when a negative (backward) angle      of bend is made by the body, while straightening up to      avoid being hit by an opening upper cabinet door. Sliding      doors are to be preferred. Sufficient floor space for      working in front of and passing between each element of the      work-center should be provided. Finally, planning should      consider such necessary features as light, acoustics, heat,      and ventilation.    </p>        <p>      The principal concept of New House cooking design is that      storage for each of the major cooking centers of activity      is provided at the point of first use. The major cooking      centers are sink, mix, range, refrigerator, oven, and      serve. Wall and base cabinets for each of these activity      centers should be the same length: about 4 feet for each      unit, except those for the sink, which should be about 8      feet long. A wall cabinet provides a good place for      indirect lighting (the light shining directly on the work      counter). The usual center ceiling fixture gives light      where it is least needed.    </p>    <p>      Much cabinet storage research has been done in recent      years. Perhaps the most noteworthy is the work done at      Cornell University. A type of "swing cabinet" is suggested.      This is a compact cabinet made of sections that swing open      like a book. Storage is one row deep, making each item easy      to see and grasp. Only the item wanted has to be lifted      out.    </p>    <p>      Door storage is a sensible method of storing small food      items, as well as small cooking utensils, spices, etc. Base      cabinets with the usual stationary shelves should be      avoided wherever possible. Shallow pull-out trays and      drawers give far better visibility and greater ease of      reaching contents. Heavy pots and pans are brought into      easy reach and full view by pulling a tray forward.      Vertical drawers are especially satisfactory below the      sink, where the often-used dishpan, dish drainer, and      brushes may be hung on hooks. A similar vertical drawer      beside the range is handy for pans and covers. Vertical      partitions or files can also be installed to advantage.      Articles stored in these files are within easy reach and      can be grasped readily. Overhead cabinets should have      sliding doors wherever possible. They do not offer as full      an exposure of contents as do swinging doors, but this      possible disadvantage can be overcome by using      glass-paneled doors.    </p>    <p>      A poorly designed cooking area costs as much to build as a      good one. The popular "Pullman," or strip-type, cooking      area, for instance, has traffic objections and is too long      for convenient working. The L-shaped arrangement is better,      especially when the range is located at the corner, where      undisturbed cooking can be done. Probably the most      practical and efficient cooking arrangement is the U-shaped      plan. (A variation of the U shape-a circular cooking      arrangement-was found to require only 70 feet of      walking to prepare a meal; the same meal in an L-shaped      cooking area required 245 feet of walking.)    </p>    <p>      New House design concepts indicate a totally new and fresh      outlook on cooking-room arrangements. The traditional      window-over-sink, for instance, is now considered obsolete,      as so little time need be spent at the sink. Cooking space      is best lighted by clearstory or skylight, and the sink      should be located near the dining area. Eating space or the      mix center, however, might well utilize window exposure. In      a good plan the cooking area is convenient to the garage as      well as to the front entrance. Yet, entrances to the      cooking area should be grouped to minimize through traffic.    </p>    <p>      Another New House design tendency is to "open up" the      cooking area to form a sort of cooking-dining-family room      area. This <em>single-space</em> arrangement does not      isolate the housewife from the rest of the family or      visiting company. The formal dining room of the 1920's has      now shrunk to dinette to alcove to nook. Actually, the      dining room can function better as a second group-living      area, with the dining table itself set in an angled alcove.      The dining table should be as close to food preparation as      possible. It is also desirable to locate the table close to      the sink for simplified cleanup. When food preparation and      cleanup are separated from dining, a utility cart can      become a useful device. The Cornell investigators designed      a neat cart that holds service for eight persons.    </p>        <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of      importance)<br />      <em>THE CORNELL KITCHEN:</em>    </p>    <p>      Glen Beyer, Cornell University, 1952.<br />      <em>KITCHEN CUPBOARDS THAT SIMPLIFY STORAGE:</em>      McCullough, Cornell Bulletin 703. <em><br />      THE HOUSE:</em> Agan & Luchsinger.<br />      <em>HUMAN ENGINEERING:</em> McCormick, 1957. <em><br />      MODERN KITCHENS:</em> Sunset Magazine.    </p>
