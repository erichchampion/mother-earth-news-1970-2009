        <p>Your article on icehouses in MOTHER NO. 17 reminded me of the way we used to make ice up in Lake-of-the-Woods.</p><p>First off, our Minnesota icehouse had its door several feet off the ground, so that you needed a ladder to get in. (Cold air flows down . . . entrances that reach all the way to the ground tend to let out all that good chill.) The building was doublewalled with sawdust as insulation, but I suppose hay, straw or rock wool would do as well.</p><p>To make ice, we used to wait until January when it was good and cold (-20Â° Fahrenheit). Then we spread a sheet of polyethylene plastic in the bottom and up the sides of the building. Next, we just laid pipe or hose from the lake and pumped in about a foot of water. (Didn't matter if there were a few small holes in the plastic . . . at 20 below the water froze before it could leak out.) When the ice was good and solid, we laid on another sheet of plastic and pumped in more water . . . and so on until we were within a foot of the building's top. Finally, we covered the whole frozen mass with 12 inches of sawdust.</p><p>Then, when we needed ice in the summer, we just shoveled aside the sawdust covering and scored the ice with a saw. A few quick blows with an axe and we had our block . . . after which we scooped the insulation back into place.</p><p>The plastic kept the levels of ice from freezing together, and could be peeled off (and saved for reuse the next winter) when we were done with a layer.</p><p>Some very important points to remember about icehouses:</p><p>[1] Ice blocks freeze together even in hot weather. (Just try squeezing two ice cubes against each other and watch them join up.)<br />[2] Rainwater ruins ice . . . make double sure your icehouse roof is waterproof or you could have a very hot summer.<br />[3] Don't build an icehouse in the sun! Nuff said.</p><p>Keith Klein<br />St. Paul, Minn.</p><p>Icehouses, of course, weren't built the same way in all parts of the country. After seeing one that was typical of this area and getting some reliable descriptions from an old-timer, I think I have a pretty good picture of how they constructed the buildings around here.</p><p>In this region, icehouses were built so that everything but the roof was underground. A cylindrical hole was dug in the earth, possibly 10 feet deep and 25 feet in diameter in the case of the structure I saw (unfortunately I didn't measure . . . and I didn't see the floor, so I don't know whether it was earth or stone). This hole was walled up around the sides with field stone, Then a rather steep conical roof (with a door) was built over it, so that from the outside all one could see was this top part apparently sitting on the ground. I assume that there was a drain to take care of the melt . . . one could easily have been run out of the building I looked at, since it was located at the beginning of a slope.</p><p>When ice-harvesting time came, one would put a layer of straw on the floor, then a layer of ice a few feet thick . . . and so on in alternating tiers until the "well" was full, or nearly so. Then the ice was covered with straw.</p><p>Why the straw between the layers? Because under pressure ice tends to melt, and then freeze together if there is a slight heat transfer. The owners surely didn't want the whole business to become one big slid iceberg.</p><p>It immediately struck me that the builders missed a good thing when they failed to insulate the roof. I've heard the complaint that such icehouses seldom kept ice until the next winter . . . and since the ground is a fair insulator, I imagine that most of the heat conduction came through that simple pine-shingle covering.</p><p>C.D.
