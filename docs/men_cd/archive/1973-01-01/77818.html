    <p>
             		     <p>      There are over a thousand apple varieties, which gives you      plenty to choose from. A few well-tested varieties, such as      Gravenstein, Golden Delicious, Grimes, Rome Beauty, and      Yellow Transparent, should be the basic stock of your      orchard, but try some of the lesser-known ones as well.      Apple trees tend to bring surprises, and a well-cared-for      minor variety may give you the most wonderful fruit.    </p>    <p>      Apples will grow almost anywhere in the United States      except in the hottest regions. They need the cool-to-cold      winters during dormancy. Your local nursery will no doubt      give you an indication of not only the feasibility of      growing apples, but the best varieties for that area as      well.    </p>		<h3>STOCK</h3>    <p>      Apple trees, except for the dwarfs, which bear small crops      in their second or third year, usually won't give you any      apples until their fifth to sixth year. But by the tenth      year they're at peak production, yielding five to ten      bushels per tree per year. And they will keep bearing for      thirty years or more. So order two varieties at the very      least. Not just because thirty or forty bushels of one kind      might become a bit boring, but because some are eating      apples and some for cooking. Also cross-fertilization will      increase your crop. Stock usually comes in one-, two-, or      three-year-olds. You'll find the older ones more expensive,      of course. On the other hand, being transplants, they are      usually sturdier trees. Bought from a good nursery, two- to      three-year-olds are your best bet.    </p>        <h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      If you buy two- or three-year-old transplants, they should      need no pruning the first two years besides the initial one      on planting to eliminate injured roots and take the wood      down a bit proportionately.    </p>    <p>      After the first two years, your primary pruning job will be      to make the tree easy to pick from and somewhat squat in      shape. The center of the tree must be kept open . . . don't      let the growth get too dense. Cut off branches that cross      and rub against each other in the wind. Any branch so large      it can't be pruned off with shears, should be cut in three      stages with a saw, as shown in the diagram.    </p>    <p>      As the tree grows older, you will notice small, short      cluster branches of buds developing along the real      branches. These must not be cut off . . . they're the      bearing spurs that will give you your fruit.    </p>    <p>      The spurs will bear lovely flowers . . . in fact, too many      of them. If you walk through your orchard one day during      blossom time and notice a host of pink and white petals      falling, don't faint. It's quite natural. The tree would      otherwise bear far too much fruit for it to carry and these      dropping flowers are its natural way of cutting back the      crop. Even so, once the fruit sets, you will probably have      to tree-cull some of it. Don't let the young apples crowd      each other. Not only can their weight break the branch, but      too many apples spoil the crop.    </p>    <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      Preventative care and healthy, well-nourished trees will      minimize problems. However, there are some regions of the      country in which cedar rust, scab, or fire blight readily      attack apple trees. In these areas resistant varieties are      grown. By taking the simple precaution of finding out from      your county agent what the pests in your region are and      selecting the appropriate resistant species, a lot of      disappointment will be avoided.    </p>    <p>      The second problem-solving rule is, if it looks unhealthy,      get rid of it. Branches with mildew or an area of      prematurely yellow, withered leaves should be pruned out,      and fallen spoiled apples or infected fruit removed. Don't      leave sickly cuttings in the neighborhood of your trees.      All diseased branches should be burned in a hot fire a good      distance from your orchard.    </p>    <p>      The first week in June hang a trap on each of your trees      for bugs. Use a wide-mouthed jar covered with a coarse wire      mesh with holes just small enough not to admit bees. Fill      it half full with a solution of one part molasses to ten      parts water. A bit of yeast helps things along. Hang the      jar on the southern side of the trunk. This will attract      all sorts of nonsense. You'll even end up with a couple of      persistent young honeybees in the wrong pot. It will also,      however, eliminate most of the apple flies, whose maggots      have an annoying habit of tunneling into your apples. Keep      the traps up for the rest of the bearing season.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if the answer (Finding half a worm.) to      "What's worse than biting into an apple and finding a      worm?" doesn't bother you, the bug trap may not be      necessary at all. The easiest solution, of course, is to      share the apples with your livestock . . . they get the      culled wormy ones.    </p>  <h3> HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      Pick apples sun-ripe, naturally. Hold the apple in your      hand thumb against the stem, and with a light upward and      sideways motion, twist it off. Be careful not to injure the      spur on which the apple grew, since it will bear again next      year. Also, don't twist the stem out of an apple you want      to store . . . this would break open the skin to      decay-causing bacteria.    </p>    <p>      You can't store summer apples, only fall and winter ones.      However, there's no need to get a bellyache harvesting      them. The cooking varieties make great applesauce and apple      butter to raid the pantry shelves for later.    </p>
