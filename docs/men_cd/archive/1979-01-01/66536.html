                <hr />    <p>      Ken Anderson shows how you can easily learn all of the      skills you'll need to run your homestead or survive in the      city...through your state university and county extension      services    </p>    		<hr />    <p>      Say you're headin' back to the land and have to pick up a      lot of rural survival skills in a hurry ... or maybe you      want to learn a new trade to increase your urban earning      potential (or to open your own business), Of course, if you      have lots of time and/or money you could take a regular      university course or apprentice yourself to a master of      your chosen craft ... but what do you do when you're bucks      down and in a big hurry? Just listen up, 'cause there is      away!    </p>    <h3>      THE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION    </h3>    <p>      You see, every one of the 50 states has a land-grant      university that-in cooperation with the federal      government-offers hundreds of short courses, seminars, and      workshops on just about any topic you can imagine. Most of      these programs are open to anyone who wants to attend them,      too, and registration (as well as materials) fees are      modest. If you're interested, just figure out what you want      to know, and then contact your state's extension service      director for a schedule of the subjects offered and class      meeting times. (See the list of names, addresses, and      telephone numbers that accompanies this article.)    </p>    <h3>      NEARBY KNOWLEDGE    </h3>    <p>      You'll also be glad to know that you won't have to travel      to here-and-gone to attend these classes ... because      extension courses are held in a number of locations      throughout every state. So the subjects that you're      interested in may be taught in your town hall, in high      school classrooms or workshops, or even in empty store      buildings!    </p>    <p>      And, if you 'can't attend the regular workshops, seminars      (or whatever), you might still be able to get the      information that you need from some of the state university      extension publications. Every extension issues a large      number of these pamphlets, fact sheets, instruction manuals      (and even books), and the publications cover everything      from beekeeping and greenhouse insulation to catfish      culture and adobe brick making. Some of these booklets are      free-for-the-askin', and others are available for as little      as a nickel. Your extension service director's office will      gladly supply you with a list of their current      publications.    </p>    <p>      If you happen to live near a state university, you should      also take advantage of the on-campus extension      offerings. As an example of the subjects covered in these      programs, one Midwestern state college schedules courses on      beef and dairy cattle, poultry management, crop drying, and      new farm equipment ... as well as the annual "Day for      Women", which actually includes a week of sessions on      everything from estate planning to energy conservation in      the kitchen.    </p>    <p>      TECHNOLOGY, TOO!    </p>    <p>      Technological subjects aren't ignored in the extension      service program, either. Many areas offer regular courses      in such subjects as auto tune-up and welding, for instance,      in which (for a payment of $20 or so) the student can get      background training and actual hands-on experience under      the sharp eye of a trained instructor. (As an added bonus,      you can often-in the tune-up classes-work on your own car      while you learn!)    </p>    <h3>      OR, BRING THE SCHOOL TO YOU!    </h3>    <p>      One of the biggest advantages of these extension services      is that-under the right circumstances-they'lI bring      the classroom to you! For example, suppose you and a dozen      or so of your friends want to take a short course on how to      raise geese for down, but-for one reason or another-you are      unable to travel to a distant campus for the one or two      days instruction that you need. Often, in such cases, the      state extension service director will send out an expert on      the subject ... who'll conduct the classes right in your      own community.    </p>    <h3>      THE COUNTY AGENT    </h3>    <p>      Another readily available source of information and      education is the "Cooperative Extension Service", which is      a joint venture of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the      state land-grant university, and the county government. The      "local" arm of this service used to be called the "County      Agent", but that title has since been changed to "County      Extension Director". The director's office-which      might (depending upon tax-base funding and such) be a      one-man show or include a whole staff of specialists in a      wide variety of subjects-is usually located in the county      courthouse. The extension director is no longer a strictly      rural phenomenon, either. Numerous cities and highly      urbanized counties maintain extension services ... and      these offices emphasize teaching folks how to deal with the      problems of the metropolis, rather than those of the      farmstead.    </p>    <p>      The county extension director's office distributes a large      number of publications, too. Many of these (like the      booklets offered by state university extensions) are free,      and all of them are within reach of any but the most      strained budget. Let your agent know what your interests      are, and he'll help you order whatever materials he doesn't      have in stock.    </p>    <p>      And, if the information that you want isn't available      locally, all you have to do is trot on over to your nearest      library and look through the current edition of the List of      Available Publications of the United States Department of      Agriculture. This is a paperback index of thousands of      booklets and pamphlets on everything from "A-Frame Cabins"      to "Zoning". Price information-and directions for      ordeing-are included in the listings ... and, again,      many of these publications can be obtained free of charge.    </p>    <h3>      IT'S UP TO YOU!    </h3>    <p>      Just in case you're not sure which university in your state      administers a land, grant extension program, I've prepared      the following list of extension service directors. So, get      in touch with your state office, because that's the      quickest, easiest, and least expensive way to "learn how      to...."    </p>    <p>      <strong>DR. J.
