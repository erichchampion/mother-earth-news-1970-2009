            		<hr />        <h5 id="byline">by       MOLLY MIRON    </h5>    		<hr />    <p>      The other day, as I thumbed through an agricultural weekly,      I came upon a lament for the demise of the old homestead      privy. As a day-to-day outhouse user, I don't have any      affectionate feelings about our outdoor commode. But I'm      accustomed to it, I guess ... and I sure don't find it the      inconvenience that some of our more citified friends seem      to.    </p>    <p>      I have to admit, however, that my initial      reaction-when we moved to our country home two      winters ago-was not so tolerant. The former tenants      had left their privy (which had served a family of seven)      uphill from the house and only 28 feet from the well.    </p>    <p>      We suffered through that first freezing winter, tried not      to think about runoff into the water supply, and poked the      rising "unmentionable" stalagmite down with a two-by-four      every day or so.    </p>    <p>      As it happened, no one developed gastroenteritis or      anything ... so come May we cleaned out the old pit and      moved the outhouse 60 feet (and over a hill) from the well.      Relief at last.    </p>    <p>      To make the relocated facility more aesthetic, I gave it a      coat of white paint (inside and out) and hung a small art      exhibit on the walls for the edification of visitors.      (Though we have one neighbor who decorated his privy with      erotic pictures and French postcards, my tastes run more to      the conservative.) The bright paint (and the artwork)      seemed enough for internal decoration ... while the summer      wildflowers handled that chore outside with no assistance      from me at all.    </p>    <p>      Though these embellishments do much to help cheer us (and      our guests) during periods of enforced inactivity in the      outhouse ... the most important factor in making a privy      acceptable is cleanliness.    </p>    <p>      We empty and bury the contents of the drop drawer regularly      and-before returning it to service-line the container      with a few inches of clean soil or sawdust ... to make the      next dumping easier. In the cold months (here in Nova    </p>    <p>      Scotia we have a stretch when everything freezes) there are      long periods when emptying the drawer is impossible. An      occasional dose of septic tank stimulant (we use Septobac)      melts the pile down some ... but that first spring      unloading is still a real job.    </p>    <p>      I also keep a bucket of wood ashes and an empty quart can      by the seat so that we can "flush" our latrine with a      sprinkle of ashes after each use. This keeps the odors      away, and-when ashes are scarce-we mix 'em with      sawdust to stretch out the supply.    </p>    <p>      Regular sweepings and wash-downs control cobwebs and grime      inside our outhouse ... while bunches of aromatic herbs and      a scented candle or two add a lot to the atmosphere.    </p>    <p>      It always surprises me when we visit people whose houses      are worlds tidler than mine, but whose privies are actually      offensive. I feel that the outhouse, as a potentially      "dirty" place, deserves a little extra housecleaning. My      husband calls me "outhouse proud", but he only means that      he'd like to see the kitchen less cluttered ... not that he      thinks the privy should be messier.    </p>    <p>      Someday, I expect, the miracles of modern plumbing (or      maybe a more modern composting toilet) will come to our      house. Will we burn down that "little house" then? Nope. It      has lots of advantages in terms of privacy, it's closer to      the barn and woods than "Indoors" is, and-since it      has no moving parts or pipes-will provide a foolproof      backup system for those days when the water lines freeze,      leak, or just stop working.    </p>    <p>      I have to admit, though, that I'll welcome indoor      facilities on occasion ... especially in January when the      outhouse is a chilling place despite our cold-weather      styrofoam seat.    </p>    <p>      And even though our privy is practical-and pleasant      enough after its "sprucing up"-I'd never write a      glowing, nostalgic piece about that little house on the      hill. Some subjects just aren't fit for eulogy.    </p>
