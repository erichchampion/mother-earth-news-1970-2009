                <p>      REPORT FROM THEM THAT'S DOIN'    </p>		<hr />        <h5 id="byline">by Robert D. Finley</h5>    		<hr />    <p>      My plan to raise goats "got off on the wrong hoof", and I      have no one to blame but myself. I should have waited to      buy my first doe from a reputable milk-goat breeder. After      all, I had read over and over again that it's better to      spend $100 on a purebred or registered goat than to pay      anything for a worthless cull (who'll cost a bundle in feed      and care and yield nothing in return). But, I had goats on      the brain, saw an ad in the local classifieds, and let my      natural impatience get the best of me.<br />      <br />      Besides that, her owner made the doe sound wonderful. She      was recently bred-I was told-and would grow into a      full-sized milker ... a Toggenburg, no less! It took me      five long months to realize that she wasn't going to have      any kids ... and that as likely as not she'd never even      been bred. It also became increasingly obvious as time went      on that Nanny-as I named her-was stunted, and that her      claim to Toggenburg ancestry was very loosely based (maybe      her mother had once been frightened by one). Worst of all,      despite months of patient cajoling, Nanny remained so      flighty that I could barely approach her. The term      "domestic animal" fit neither her temperament nor her      purpose.<br />      <br />      But, since I'm not a person who gives up easily, I decided      to look for a buck to service the doe. All of my reference      volumes noted that it's foolish for a farmer without a      large herd to purchase a buck, so I combed the area for a      Toggenburg at stud. I couldn't find one anywhere, but I did      locate a buck of that breed for sale. Chalk up mistake      number two ... I brought the handsome golden-maned lover      home. As the months went by, though, it began to seem that      Billy's rut odor was just so much B.O. to my Nanny ... she      spurned his advances time and time again.</p><p> So, I called the      vet and was told that my prudish doe was sexually      underdeveloped, but that there was an injection that might      bring her into heat. Nanny apparently didn't like the idea,      because she escaped on the way to the clinic and I never      saw her again.      I confess that-though she'd cost me a good bit of money by      that timeI was more relieved than sad to see her go.<br />      <br />      Billy, on the other hand, turned out to be a marvelous      goat. We cavorted together for hours at a time, like a      Couple of kids. Unfortunately, the buck wasn't able to give      milk to pay for his keep, and so-with what was by now a      grim determinationI set out to find a real Toggenburg doe.      Finally, after I'd driven most every back road in      Mississippi, I located one of the lovely ladies ... and was      told that she'd been bred the previous month. By that time      I didn't even care that Billy's services wouldn't be needed      right away. I bought New Nanny and just figured that my      buck would get his chance after the kids were born. I      suppose I should have noticed that there weren't many      Toggenburgs around my area, but I didn't. So much for      mistake number three.<br />      <br />      Eight weeks after I brought the new doe home, I walked out      one day to find that Billy had clambered into the narrow      milking stanchion ... and strangled himself in his efforts      to get back out. As I removed the buck's already stiffened      body from the structure, I began to wonder if I was really      cut out to raise goats.<br />      <br />      But, I still had New Nanny, who was large, big-boned, and      had a well-formed bag and teats ... a real milker! She was      also, however, half dead from intestinal parasites and      improper feed. I wormed her, stopped milking her two months      prior to when She was due to kid, fed her copious amounts      of grain, and let her browse in a large patch of      honeysuckle and briars. With all of this care she was soon      as healthy a goat as you'll ever see. Her due date,      however, came and went with no sign that she was ready to      bear kids. I waited and watched for two more months, in the      hope that she had mated with my deceased Billy. Finally, I      had to accept the fact that her bulge was nothing more than      the result of too much feed.<br />      <br />      It's been two years now since I bought my first goat. I      recently mated New Nanny to a high-class registered Nubian      buck ... but it's too soon to know whether she'll finally      have kids and a new milk supply. What I do know, however,      is that I've-so far-parted with over $250 for goats, feed,      etc., and gained a grand total of five gallons of milk in      return. That-for the mathematically minded among you works      out to about $12.50 a quart!<br />      <br />      About the only way I can get any use out of my      goat-mistakes is to turn them into principles that might      help other folks to do better than I did. These rules are:      [1] Buy only from a conscientious breeder of milk goats (by      the time you can tell whom to trust, you'll know enough so      that they couldn't rip you off anyway), [2] purchase a      breed that's common in your area, and [3] buy only a doe      with young kids ... it's the one way to be sure of what      you're gettin'.<br />      <br />      As I attempt to boil my experiences down to the point where      they might be of help to someone else, however, I get the      urge simply to say, "Don't buy goats at all!" This may      sound like an extreme statement, but it's at least as much      the result of serious consideration as it is a product of      frustration.<br />      <br />      Think of the simplicity, for instance, that you can find in      an animal-less homestead. Without beasts there's little      need for outbuildings, for pasture, or-if nearby neighbors      don't have problem critters-for fences (after all, these      enclosures exist primarily to keep animals in or out).      Perhaps even Helen and Scott Nearing considered these      factors when they decided to follow a "no animals" policy      on their homestead.<br />      <br />      And, at the risk of sounding corny, doesn't the "back to      the land" movement follow a somewhat spiritual path? Isn't      there "spirituality" in the choice of simplicity over      complexity, and in the struggle to do more with less? Do      livestock really contribute to the achievement of these      goals?<br />      <br />      I think that the time is just about here when Ifor onewill      feed all of the food that I grow to humans rather than to      animals. Goats, I admit, make fine pets ... but we      Americans have far too many Pets already. It may be that a      person is "starting wrong with goats" when he or she starts      with goats in the first place.    </p>
