            		<hr />            <p>      This truly attractive house-designed around an      honest-to-goodness Trombe wall--represents the "state of      the art" in (ultra) low-technology solar heating.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>Anyone who's familiar with solar-heated houses knows      that there are any number of ways to harness the sun's      energy ... from the simplest "passive" approach (the      "little guy's" method) all the way up to the expensive,      highly technical, "active" systems that big business tends      to promote.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Recently, one of MOTHER's staffers and a photographer      went to Landenberg, Pennsylvania to look at one of the      "simple" systems and to talk to its designer      -produce-salesman-turned-builder Jim Kries--who is in      the process of constructing a small community of passively      heated solar houses ... which he very appropriately calls      "Sunburst" homes.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Mind you, though, these houses don't utilize what you      might call your "average" solar collector. Instead, Jim has      opted to incorporate a "Trombe wall" (named after its      inventor, French physicist Felix Trombe), which not only      heats the house</em> without any moving parts or expensive      equipment, <em>but makes the dwelling as attractive (at      least!) as any custom-built conventional home. In fact, the      owners of the house-Vincent and Kathy      Polidoro--decided to buy it when they saw the blueprints      ... before construction of the home had even begun. And,      after talking to the Polidoros, we're convinced that they      haven't been disappointed at all!</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      It's no secret that solar-heated dwellings have come into      their own in the past decade or so . . . thanks largely to      the efforts of many "unconventional" -yet dedicated-      designers. Folks like David Wright (see Plowboy Interview,      MOTHER NO. 47), William Shurcliff, Steve Baer (Plowboy      Interview, MOTHER NO. 22), Bruce Anderson (Plowboy      Interview, MOTHER NO. 52), and a host of others saw a      definite need to "make hay while the sun shines" rather      than just sit around and complain about the rising costs of      fossil fuels.    </p>    <p>      And there's no doubt that these solar homes <em>really work      ...</em> despite what the skeptics say about cloudy days,      winter storms, and other "no-sun" situations. But- with a      few exceptions- most effective solar homes aren't as      attractive as their designers-or the public-would like them      to be. Let's face it, there's not too much you can do to      improve the looks of a solar collector without lowering its      efficiency ... until now, that is. Because the Jim      Kries-designed "Sunburst" solar house is a real beauty!    </p>    <p>      You see, instead of trying to "hide" the collector in the      back yard, Jim decided to use it as the <em>entire</em>      south wall of the ground floor. To do this, he built a      14-inch-thick, 225-square-foot "Trombe wall" which is      painted black on its outer surface (to absorb and hold the      sun's heat) and is finished in white stucco on the inside      (to assure an attractive, light, "airy" look in the house's      dining and living room areas).    </p>    <p>      Of course, this "collector wall" isn't directly exposed to      the weather. Instead, the entire surface is faced with      another 225 feet (or so) of 5/8-inch-thick insulated glass,      which is mounted-from floor to ceiling--about six inches in      front of the actual collector. The double wall creates a      passageway for the heated air to follow. And, as Kries is      quick to point out, that insulated glass-although it is      expensive-is no more so than common replacement panes for      sliding doors ... because that's exactly what it is! In      other words, instead of using fancy solar hardware where      it's not needed, Jim "made do" with standard building      materials ... to reduce costs and to insure that      replacements would be available in the event of accidental      damage.    </p>    <p>      So what we have, then, is a low-cost, simple way of      collecting and storing heat ... which is great in the      winter. But what about the summer? Well, Jim has that one      figured out, too. You'll notice in the photographs that the      south-facing upstairs wall (the one which is <em>above</em>      the Trombe wall) is cantilevered three and a half feet      beyond the glass "wall" below it. This overhang effectively      protects that expanse of glass from the rays of the high      summer sun ... and, if the sun can't get to the glass or      the black wall behind it, no heat is produced. Also, most      of the rays that do find their way to the collector surface      just "bounce off", because of the oblique angle at which      they strike the glass.    </p>    <p>      To insure that the house is <em>completely</em> free of      unwanted hot air in the summer, Kries installed a large      attic fan in the dwelling's second-story roof. Though he      doesn't foresee a need for this addition, Jim explains that      the fan serves as a positive "warm air exhaust route",      which <em>might</em> be needed in the event of unusually      hot or humid summer weather.    </p>    <h3>      SUPPLEMENTAL HEAT... JUST IN CASE    </h3>    <p>      The Trombe wall-despite its size and mass--still can only      provide about 60 to 75% of the house's total winter heating      needs (an impressive percentage, considering the low-cost      simplicity of the system). Therefore, Jim added two      auxiliary heat sources which-he hopes--won't ever see much      use.    </p>    <p>      The main "backup system" is a 98,000 Btu/hr.,      thermostat-activated, oil-burning hot water furnace,      which-because A's a two-zone design ("two-zone" means that      the temperatures of two different areas can be controlled      separately)only supplies heat where it's actually needed.      Although the furnace is capable of providing all of the      heat that would ever be necessary, Kries hopes that it will      only be used on the coldest of days. The thermostats are      set at 55*F, and thus far-says the builder-the furnace has      not had to come on.    </p>    <p>      In addition to this "conventional" source of heat, Jim also      makes use of an attractive Morso 1125 wood burning stove      ... a unit that's not only favored for its high Btu output,      but which also can be converted into a fairly efficient      "open fireplace" by removing the doors. And, since the      Sunburst house is located on two wooded acres, fuel supply      should be no problem.    </p>    <h3>      INSULATION MAKES THE DIFFERENCE    </h3>    <p>      Jim was determined to make his design as energy efficient      as possible, and that meant using insulation to its fullest      potential. To accomplish this, Kries framed the entire      structure with 2 X 6's on 24-inch centers (instead of the      usual 2 X 4's) ... which give the house a rocksolid      framework <em>and</em> allow a greater-than-usual amount of      insulation to be used. Jim took advantage of this extra      space, too. . . he installed six-inch fiberglass batting      (over one-inch styrofoam sheeting) in the walls, and nine      inches of batting in the ceiling.    </p>    <p>      In addition to insulating the walls and ceiling to the      limits (they have R-values of 24 and 30 respectively),      Kries also paid special attention to the foundation of the      house (the 16-inch-thick "solar slab") by first laying down      a full inch of tongue-and-groove styrofoam. This material      was covered with six inches of gravel, which-in turn-was      topped with six more inches of concrete. Finally the      foundation was finished off with 3 inches of brick veneer,      which serves as the floor of the living room. Not only does      this "layering" prevent cold from seeping in through the      foundation, but it also stores warmth within the mass of      the floor. . . which works in concert with the Trombe wall      to hold collected heat and release it slowly. (The Trombe      wall is mounted directly on the insulated "solar slab"      foundation of the house ... which also supports the masonry      chimney in the center of the building. In this manner, both      the heat collected through the Trombe wall <em>and</em>      that absorbed by the chimney via the fireplace are held      inside the entire structure for up to 16 hours).    </p>    <p>      But the high insulation factor isn't the only thing that      keeps heat within the house ... Jim has made clever use of      "airlock" double-door entryways (a fancy way of describing      old-fashioned vestibules), and he also relies on several      south-facing windows to admit heat (and light) into various      rooms in the house ... including the living/dining area      behind the otherwise solid Trombe wall.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <div class="image">        <img src="../images/055-108-01-pix21.jpg" alt="055-108-01-pix21.jpg" width="416" height="512" />        </div>				<div class="image">        <img src="../images/055-108-01-pix10.jpg" alt="055-108-01-pix10.jpg" width="379" height="215" />      </div>      <h3>        HOW IT WORKS      </h3>      <p>        The rays of the low winter sun strike the insulated glass        collector wall face almost perpendicularly and pass        through to the black-surfaced Trombe wall ... which        collects and holds a good deal of the heat that's fed        into it. In addition, whatever "extra" heat the Trombe        wall can't contain is transferred by conduction to the        "solar slab" below it. So, in effect, all the cement and        masonry in the house act as a heat storage system.      </p>      <p>        Now, as the sun beats in through the south-facing glass        wall (filling the Trombe wall with thermal energy), it        also warms up the space between the glass and the        collector surface, causing the air to rise and pour into        the house through the hot air inlets (which are nothing        more than a series of small vents built into the top of        the collector wall. These inlets are equipped with        one-way dampers that allow hot air to pass into the        house, but don't let any of the precious warmth back        out). Of course, because of the insulated glass most of        the warmth accumulated in this air channel is retained        and passed on to the rest of the structure,      </p>      <p>        As this heated air rises, it causes the cooler air from        the floor of the house to be drawn out through the cool        air outlets at the base of the collector wall (which are        just 8" X 8" ducts formed into the concrete). In this        manner, a complete heat flow cycle (through the room and        back around the face of the collector) is maintained.      </p>      <p>        So, as the air circulates past this Trombe wall, it        effectively heats the lower floor of the house. But what        about the second story? Well, that's been taken care of,        too, by the installation of a 4' X 8' opening between the        two floors in the form of a balcony ... which is directly        above one of the hot air inlets at the top of the Trombe        wall. This balcony allows a good deal of warm air to        circulate throughout the upper story of the house, and to        return-by way of that opening-to mix with the        heated air that is being forced (by convection) through        the registers at the top of the Trombe wall. (This system        of flow effectively prevents all the warm air from rising        up through the balcony opening ... as some of it is        naturally forced into the downstairs rooms by the        returning cool air.) In addition to the heat provided by        the collector, there are several south-facing insulated        glass windows in the structure, which help provide light        and heat during daylight hours (but allow very little        heat to escape at night).      </p>      <p>        When the sun goes down, the heat that is stored in the        collector wall (and in the solar slab below it) begins to        radiate into the rooms, maintaining a comfortable        temperature for as long as 16 hours. Even the        wood-burning stove acts as part of this energy        storage system . . . because both the masonry slab        beneath the wood burner and its centrally located masonry        chimney "grab"--by conduction-much of the warmth        that would otherwise disappear up the stove's flue.      </p>      <p>        All of these systems go a long way toward providing the        heat necessary for a comfortable winter ... but they        would have guaranteed a very hot summer if Kries hadn't        thought ahead. You see, Jim designed a 3-1/2-foot        overhang above the Trombe wall, and this shelf        effectively prevents the higher summer sun from shining        onto the collector surface. And, most of the light that        does manage to find its way to the glass wall actually        <em>bounces off</em> . . . because the sun's rays strike        the glass at an oblique angle. An attic "warm air        exhaust" tan provides a final backup cooling system ...        just in case a real heat wave happens along.      </p>      <p>        In addition to this well-planned heating and cooling        system, Kries has insulated the house more than        adequately (he also plans to earth-berm the north side of        the structure ... in order to deflect cold northern winds        up and over the roof). All in all, it'd be hard to        imagine a more efficient passive solar home.      </p>      <h3>        BUILDING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS      </h3>      <p>        The Sunburst solar house (as well as all the subsequent        Sunburst dwellings) uses no unorthodox methods of        construction. Standard procedures and materials are        utilized throughout, and even the Trombe wall can be        constructed by any capable mason. On the other hand, the        word "standard" can't really be applied to the home:        "Above standard" is a much more applicable term. Yellow        pine floors (covered with a polyurethane coating) are        used where the masonry floors are not necessary for heat        retention ... hand-routed Idaho white pine serves as        molding and window framing ... and 8- by 12-inch solid        elm lintels are mounted above the three downstairs        south-facing windows.      </p>      <p>        Jim admits that the $70,000-plus price tag he puts on the        Sunburst house might seem a bit steep to some people ...        but he also points out that the price includes a two-acre        piece of land, high-quality materials, and a good deal of        hand workmanship. These factors, plus the savings gained        by using the Trombe wall, make the home a good buy in the        long run. And, of course, if the owners were to build the        house themselves, considerable savings would be realized.      </p>      <h3>        CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE      </h3>      <p>        Of course, Jim Kries didn't just stumble upon the idea        for a Trombe wall by himself ... he selected the concept        from a variety of others that were offered at a national        conference on passive solar energy at the University of        Pennsylvania last spring. In addition to the information        that he picked up at that conference, Kries relied        heavily on the experiences of Douglas Kelbaugh, who        designed (and has been living in) a Trombe-walled solar        house in Princeton, New Jersey since 1975 (see "At Last:        A <em>Beautiful</em> Solar Home! ", MOTHER NO. 43, page        68). Jim also admits that he got a good deal of help and        inspiration from Alex Wade, author of the book 30        <em>Energy Efficient Houses You Can Build</em> (Rodale        Press).      </p>      <h3>        THE GOOD AND THE BAD      </h3>      <p>        There's little doubt that the Trombe wall concept is a        good one ... and the idea works as well in "real life" as        it's supposed to on paper. There are, however, several        disadvantages that must be pointed out. Perhaps the most        serious of these is that the collector wall can only        retain its heat for about 16 hours ... less than the        "average" passive system, and far less than a typical        active system utilizing a liquid medium and tank or rock        storage. Also, the Trombe wall would be difficult to add        to an already built structure, and the nature of the wall        is such that large open windows are impractical (since        window area has to be "subtracted" from the collector        surface).      </p>      <p>        Nonetheless, the many benefits of the Trombe wall easily        outweigh its weaknesses. For instance, because the wall        is <em>completely</em> passive, nothing short of a major        disaster will harm it ... and there aren't any components        to break down or otherwise fail. And, since the system        uses standard construction and materials, it's relatively        easy to build. Perhaps best of all, though, no outside        sources of power are necessary to keep the Trombe wall in        operation, and it lends itself to a variety of aesthetic        modifications.      </p>      <p>        Needless to say, Jim Kries feels that his Trombe wall is        the answer that many folks-burdened by spiraling fuel        costs--have been looking for. "The thing that intrigues        me most about this passive system," says Jim, "is that        there is absolutely nothing that <em>can</em> break down.        Furthermore there's nothing that the public utilities,        the oil companies, or even the government can do to make        any money on it ... so the people who aggravate me the        most--those who want to control <em>my</em> life -can't        do a damn thing, and I can sit here in my warm house and        tell them to go scratch! " Isn't that exactly what most        of us would like to be able to do?      </p>      <p>        <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you like the house you see here,        you'll be pleased to know that MOTHER has made some        special arrangements with Jim Kries.
