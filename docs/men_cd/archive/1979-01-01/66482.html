            		<hr />    <p>      Here it is, the most efficient campfire coaxer we've ever      seen...    </p>                            		<hr />    <p>      If you've ever gone camping or backpackingespecially in      inclement weather-you know what a problem it can be to get      a fire going. Snow, damp wood, and the ol' North Wind      always seem to work (often together!) to the hapless      outdoorsman's (or outdoorswoman's) disadvantage.<br />      <br />      Sure, there are those who claim that their Zippo never      fails, or that their waxed matches can't <em>possibly</em>      get wet in a tin container ... but nonetheless, we'd hate      to count the number of campers who've been left out in the      cold by such "guaranteed" fire-starting methods as      these.<br />      <br />      But now (finally!) MOTHER has discovered a "sure-fire"      gadget that just can't do anything <em>but</em> work ...      unless your kindling is drowning in water! It's called the      Magnesium Fire Starting Tool, and it's manufactured by the      Doan Machinery & Equipment Company, 2336 South Belvoir      Boulevard, Cleveland, Ohio 44118.<br />      <br />      This handy tool consists of a small (3/8" X 1" X 3") block      of solid magnesium, with a full length flint "sparking      insert" set into one long edge of the gadget. Because      magnesium is relatively soft, the block can be scraped with      a pocket knife to form a small pile of shavings. Then, when      the same knife is used (by striking the edge of the      sparking insert) to ignite the shavings, the magnesium      flares up at a temperature of 5400°F ... more than hot      enough to light the stubbornest campfire.<br />      <br />      To start your blaze, first clear an area of any leaves and      underbrush to a radius of three feet or more from where      you're going to build your fire. Then collect some large      rocks and construct a semicircle in the midst of the area      you've just cleared.<br />      <br />      Now cut yourself two forked sticks about one foot long and      force them into the ground so the "forks" are six inches or      so above the soil. Take another stick that's long enough to      reach between the two forks and lay it in place in the      "crutches" of the forked sticks (see Photo 1), then gather      some preferably dry twigs and kindling (yes, damp wood will      work, but it can't be soaking wet) and set it against this      cross stick as shown in Photo 2. For a quick start, find      yourself some dry grass or straw and place it underneath      the kindling on a bed of dry leaves.<br />      <br />      Next, take a large leaf and lay it on the ground before the      campfire (if there's a wind blowing, better dig out a small      depression and put the leaf in that), then hold the fire      starting tool in one hand (with the flint edge in your palm      and the "scraping" side up) and shave the bits of magnesium      onto the leaf with a knife held so the blade is      perpendicular to the surface of the tool ... as in Photo      3.<br />      <br />      When you've scraped enough magnesium off the bar to      accumulate a pile about the size of a quarter, place the      shavings at the base of the campfire in the midst of the      straw and dried leaf chips-as in Photo 4and then hold the      tool within one inch of the magnesium slivers (at about a      45° angle, with the flint side up) and scrape the      entire length of the flint sparking insert with the knife      blade held perpendicularly to it (see Photo 5).<br />      <br />      After a few strokes, the sparks generated will cause the      magnesium shavings to ignite ... and in a matter of      seconds, the kindling will be ablaze (Photo 6), needing      only the addition of some larger fuel to make a roaring      conflagration that any woodsperson. would be proud      of.<br />      <br />      The best part about the Magnesium Fire Starting Tool is      that it can't be damaged by the weather ... if it gets wet,      you merely dry it off and use it as if nothing had      happened. And it's small enough to just slip in your pocket      and forget about till you need it. Also, the tool is      perfectly safe in solid bar form. Even when thrown into a      campfire, the magnesium block won't ignite for about 15      minutes ... and then it'll burn with a golden glow but no      explosion ... the substance must be shaved before it'll      flare up easily. What more could you ask for when the wood      is wet and the wind is blowin'?<br />      <br />    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The Magnesium Fire Starting Tool is      available for $4.95 plus 50c postage and handling from BPS,      P.O.
