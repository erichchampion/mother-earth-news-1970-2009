            		<hr />        <p>      If those late-winter blues have got you down, take a tip      from Susan Fries Ezell...    </p>		<hr />        <p>      When the snow piles up to the attic window and every night      seems six weeks long, any activity-work or      play-that can be shared with someone else takes on a      special importance.<br />      <br />      And, as most MOTHER-type people know, television      isn't the only way to fill a quiet evening (in fact, TV      rates somewhere below the bottom in most any list of      entertainment possibilities). Games, for instance, have      provided men and women with amusement-and a means of      communication- for centuries ... and dominoes is one      of the oldest table games around.<br />      <br />      Although nearly everybody discovered and discarded some      type of domino game as a child, the speckled rectangles      (called "bones" in domino lingo) can be used in some      intricate and challenging contests. And a good domino      game-no matter how complex-will never be so      involved that it gets in the way of conversation. What more      could you ask of a game?    </p>    <h3>      CHOOSING A DOMINO SET    </h3>    <p>      Most any toy shop (and many department-type stores) carries      domino games. The prices of these can range from about      $2.00-for a basic set of wooden bonesup to a king's      ransom for the hand-tooled outfits made of ivory. Most of      the latter are unnecessarily fancy, but don't automatically      eliminate the <em>slightly</em> more expensive dominoes      when you go out to buy. The texture and weight of the      playthings-and the tiny "click" you hear as each      piece is played-are intrinsic to the mood of the      game.<br />      <br />      Domino sets are available in three varieties: double-six,      double-nine, and double-twelve. These names indicate the      maximum number of dots on one bone. The double-six set,      with 28 pieces, is standard ... but the larger games can      make much of your playing more exciting. Start out with a      cheap box of sixes, and then-once you're      hooked-you'll be ready for the big ones.    </p>    <h3>      MUGGINS, OR FIVE-POINT    </h3>    <p>      Muggins is a good beginner's domino game (those who want to      get adventurous should find a copy of <em>The Domino      Book</em> by Fredrick Berndt, $5.95 in hard cover from      Thomas Nelson, Inc.).<br />      <br />      In fact, most people who've been exposed to the spotted      blocks have encountered muggins in one of its many      variations. However, few people today have tried the      "formal" rules ... which make up muggins as our      grandparents might have played it.<br />      <br />      The difference between simple dominoes and all-out      five-point shows up in the scoring. Though you <em>do</em>      play by matching the number of dots (also called "pips") on      a side of one of your bones to those on a domino already at      an end of the "line of play" (the arrangement-on the      playing table-of those pieces already set down),      <em>you can only make points when the sum of the pips on      the outside ends of the series adds up to a multiple of      five.<br />      <br /></em> Thus in this line of play:    </p>        <p>      the last player has scored (three plus two) five points,      while here:    </p>        <p>      there is no score because the two ends, added together,      make six. Accumulated points are recorded using an elegant      system of big and little X ... with each slanted stroke      equaling five and a completed figure representing fifty:    </p>        <p>      Five completed patterns (250 points) end a game.<br />      <br />      Play begins with all of the dominoes <em>face down</em> on      the playing surface. Each contestant draws one, and the      person holding the highest number of spots will begin the      hand.<br />      <br />      Once the bones used to determine the order of play have      been returned to that group sitting spots-down on the      table (this central store of dominoes is called a "bone      pile"), the chosen player draws seven ... <em>after</em>      which his opponent does the same (muggins is usually a      two-person game, though four can play a short version if      they limit the draw to five pieces each).    </p>        <p>      The opening player starts the game by leading any domino in      his hand (a six-four, two-three, or the like is a good      first play, as it does-since the sum of both ends is      a multiple of five-score points). Either side of this      first bone is then available for the other gamester to work      from. Any time a player <em>can't</em> match one of the      ends of the line of play he may draw up <em>to two</em>      from the bone pile ... and <em>then</em> play-if he      can-or pass. (If a contestant is able to lay a domino      down, he must do it ... sandbagging is definitely      <em>not</em> allowed.)<br />      <br />      The dominoes form a straight line until the first      doublet-a piece with the same number of pips on each      end-is played. This double is set at right angles to      the line of play, and <em>both</em> sides of it count      toward any possible score. Like this:    </p>        <p>      The doublet on the right has a value of six, so the player      scores six plus four, or 10 points. The <em>first</em>      double on the board-and only the first-can then      be played upon from both ends <em>and</em> from the middle.      The game proceeds in a straight line first, and the cross      piece no longer counts <em>until</em> its ends are brought      into play. This move scores five points:    </p>        <p>      But, after one or both <em>ends of</em> the doublet have      been brought into the game, suddenly there are three or      four numbers to add up as possible points ... and bigger      scores to be made, like this:    </p>        <p>      WOW! A whopping 20 points.<br />      <br />      Any other doublets are played perpendicularly, as was the      first, and have both ends counted for score until their      centers have been played upon ... but these latecomers      don't open up new lines of play. That could get too blamed      confusing!<br />      <br />      When one contestant empties his hand, or when the bone pile      has been used and neither hand can play, the game is      over.<br />      <br />      Whichever player has the fewest total pips in front of him      at the end of a match is awarded the difference between      that number and the number of dots held by his opponent ...      rounded off to the nearest five.<br />      <br />      That's all there is to muggins. Give it a try, but remember      ... pocket computers are frowned upon by real domino folks!    </p>
