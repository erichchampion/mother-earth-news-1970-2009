Sc., Ph.D.) claims that you can use      sorghum seeds to get ...    </p>        		<hr />    <p>      Some years ago, while doing research on the properties of      sorghum seed, I discovered that a genetic female hormone      was quite prevalent in these small, glossy kernels.<br />      <br />      I had a feeling that this sorghum hormone could, perhaps,      influence the percentage of female birds hatched, and-to      check this "hunch"I set up an experiment using zebra      finches ... which (because they regularly hatch up to four      eggs a month) seemed the best choice available to me.<br />      <br />      Before I began the research, these birds had hatched out a      predictable half-and-half mixture of male and female      finches.<br />      <br />      I decided to keep a full dish of sorghum seeds in the      aviary at all times and watch for developments.<br />      <br />      At first the birds didn't show much interest in the new      food, but-in the course of three or four weeks-they began      to feed on the sorghum before moving on to their regular      feeders ... and they followed this pattern both morning and      evening. Then, after two or three months, I began to notice      an increase In the number of female birds hatched.<br />      <br />      In fact, by the end of the first year of      sorghum-supplemented feeding, my finches produced close to      four female birds for every male hatched! Unfortunately,      other (and, at the moment, more important) matters      interrupted my experiments before I could take the time to      See if my "discovery" held true for larger birds,      too.<br />      <br />      I do hope to continue this research-as soon as time      allows-with Marsh's Pharaoh Coturnix Quail, because      these birds are about the most prolific larger fowl that      I've come across. Quail eggs hatch within 16 days, and the      chicks actually begin laying eggs themselves by five or six      weeks after hatching. Obviously, these qualities would help      the experiments proceed quickly.<br />      <br />      In the meantime, however, I'm glad to pass this little bit      of information along to anyone who has a few chickens,      geese, etc. and who would be interested in seeing if      sorghum seed will increase the percentage of female chicks      produced by these more practical barnyard fowls.<br />      <br />      I can assure you that I've found nothing in sorghum that      was not definitely <em>beneficial to</em> the health of any      birds fed on this seed.<br />      <br />      And, in exchange for this little tip, I'd appreciate it if      any of you poultry-raising MOTHER readers who try this      experiment with your own birds would drop me a line ...      just to let me know what results (if any) you might have.      Just address any such information to Dr. N.W. Walker, P.O.      Box 13206, Phoenix, Arizona 85002.<br />      <br /><hr />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: MOTHER would like to thank the</em>      Poultry Press, Box 947, York, <em>Pennsylvania 17405,</em>      for <em>bringing</em> Dr. Walker's experiments to her      <em>attention.</em>    </p>
