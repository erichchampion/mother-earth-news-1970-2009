        	    <h5 id="byline">by       BRENT ELSWICK    </h5>		<hr />		<p>      This year while you daydream over those spring seed      catalogs-give careful consideration to some of the      incredible crossbreeds now on the market.    </p>    		<hr />    <p>      I know some lifetime gardeners who refuse to grow hybrids.    </p>    <p>      "Crossbreeds are pretty to look at," those folks will      admit, "but they just don't have any taste at all!"    </p>    <p>      if you feel the same way, I'm here to tell you (after      experimenting with these new strains for a number of years)      that it simply ain't so.    </p>    <p>      Aside from the fact that hybrids offer greater uniformity,      more vigor, and improved resistance to diseases, many of      these modern vegetable varieties will flat astound you with      their superior tastes!    </p>    <p>      Now, don't get me wrong! I don't have anything against      longtime, open-pollinated stalwarts such as the Beefsteak      tomato, Jersey Wakefield cabbage, or Golden Bantam sweet      corn. The point that I do want to make, though, is that      some of the new strains have simply zoomed right past the      old standards of excellence we've set for our vegetables.    </p><h3>KRAUT AND COOKIN' CABBAGE</h3>    <p>      Sure, some hybrids aren't anything special, but the same      thing can be said for a lot of old standbys. Late Flat      Dutch cabbage, for example, has been around for ages, but      I've yet to hear anyone praise its taste.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, you can't find a more delicious cookin'      variety than Gourmet cabbage. (just add a little butter,      salt, and pepper ... steam it in a small amount of water .      . . and let your taste buds judge its flavor!) And, not      only does this hybrid produce as early as Jersey Wakefield      ... it's also much more disease resistant.    </p>    <p>      If you want a larger cabbage that matures later, Roundup is      about the best there is. It surpasses Late Flat Dutch in      all respects ... especially in flavor. And it's also one of      the better cabbages to use in sauerkraut.    </p><h3>A FAVORITE GETS BETTER</h3>    <p>      Now, let's move on to that one vegetable loved by almost      everyone: sweet corn. The top choice in this category for      the last half-century has been Golden Bantam, with      Stowell's Evergreen almost as popular among fanciers of      white corn.    </p>    <p>      But, while both of these "old-timers" are still fine      varieties, many people feel that the new Seneca Chief and      Silver Queen are the finest tastin' sweet corns that ever      came out of the ground. As delectable as they are, however,      my own personal favorites are A&C No. 18 yellow sweet      corn and Silver Sensation white sweet corn. Since it's sold      by only one firm (Abbot and Cobb Seed Company), A&C No.      18 isn't very widely known. But this main-season,      eight-inch, mostly two-eared variety is tremendously      toothsome. As for Silver Sensation, it's best known for its      unique nutty taste, and this corn is so vigorous that it'll      I grow just about anywhere!    </p>    <p>      There are dozens of other fantastic sweet corn hybrids      available as well. Among these, jubilee, Xtra-Sweet,      Burpee's Honeycross, Gold Cup, Wonderful, NK 199, and White      Delight are especially worthy of mention.    </p>    <p>      But the biggest news on the corn scene is the development      of the new EH line. It's got all of the good qualities of      the widely acclaimed Illini Xtra-Sweet species, plus a      couple of big added attractions. You see, unlike the Illini      Xtra-Sweet, EH doesn't have to be isolated from whatever      other corn you may grow ... and its tender kernels remain      edible and tasty for up to 14 days after pickin'. That      means future supermarket shoppers may be able to buy fresh      corn that's actually appetizin'.    </p>		<h3>CREAM OF THE CANTALOUPES</h3>    <p>      Cantaloupes are another crop that's benefited from the      development of new species. Old varieties like Hearts of      Cold and    </p>    <p>      Pride of Wisconsin are always delicious, but they don't      stand up to diseases like the equally savory Burpee Hybrid,      Ambrosia, Supermarket, Harper Hybrid, Classic, Samson, and      Gold Star.    </p>    <p>      To most people, however, the real Cadillac of cantaloupes      is the very popular Saticoy Hybrid. Its adaptability and      productiveness have to be seen to be believed,      and-because Saticoy is very disease      resistant-this strain will thrive in most any area      that has a sufficiently long growing season.    </p>    <p>      If you live in a colder clime, though, try the hybrid      called Alaska. This sought-after new release will      mature two to three weeks earlier than Saticoy. It's shaped      like a football, weighs three or four pounds, and has an      exquisite taste. (it greatly resembles the old Mainerock      hybrid, but its quality is far superior.)</p>			<h3>BIG-HEARTED WATERMELONS</h3>    <p>      While hybridization hasn't had much effect on the      watermelon industry, there are many fine new breeds worth      growin'. Some of the better ones are Top Yield, Family Fun,      Fordhook Hybrid, Sweetmeat, and Yellow Baby ... and I'm      particularly fond of Summer Festival and Yellow Doll.    </p>    <p>      Summer Festival looks like a short version of the old      Charleston Gray, and usually weighs between 12 and 15      pounds. Besides being scrumptious, this melon is never      stringy or hollow-hearted.    </p>    <p>      Yellow Doll-while not as productive as Summer      Festival-is an eight-to-ten pound, golden-fleshed      variety with a wonderful, unique flavor all its own. If      you've never tasted yellow-fleshed watermelons, you're      really missing a treat. There're a lot of good ones around,      and Yellow Doll is the best of the bunch.    </p>       <h3>PROLIFEROUS PEPPERS AND EAGER EGGPLANT</h3>			 <p>      Most sweet peppers taste just about the same. (I can barely      distinguish the difference in the 20 or so varieties I've      grown.) But hybridization has improved both the growth      habits and productivity of these plants.    </p>    <p>      Bell Boy is still the best of the many pepper hybrids      developed in the last few years. This large, blocky,      thick-walled beauty is so sturdy and prolific that      I've seen as many as two dozen peppers on a single plant.    </p>    <p>      Golden Spike is a fine new hybrid hot pepper that soared to      popularity in a very short time. It resembles Cubanelle or      Hot Banana, and produces dozens of extremely hot peppers      that turn red as they ripen. Other fine crossbreeds are      Green Boy, Lady Bell, Pick-A-Peck, and Canape.    </p>    <p>      Eggplant is in the same boat as peppers. The flavor of the      hybrids (while every bit as good as the old types) isn't      really superior ... but the purple beauties sure have been      improved in other ways: The new breeds produce more freely      and are h3er in all respects.    </p>    <p>      Dusky-which you can harvest much earlier than any      other eggplant- has become a big favorite with both      commercial growers and home gardeners. Other leading      hybrids are Mission Bell, Burpee Hybrid, Royal Knight, and      Jersey King.    </p>		<h3>CRISPY CUCUMBERS</h3>    <p>      In many areas of the country, it's impossible to grow any      cucumbers except the disease-resistant hybrids. I      know. Every time I tried to raise such famous old varieties      as Straight Eight, Long Green, Marketer, Longfellow, and      National Pickle, diseases and insects wreaked havoc on my      crop ... and I eventually <em>had</em> to turn to      crossbreeds to get good results.</p><p>    Surecrop was the first I tried, and its size and    fruitfulness amazed me but the quality was only fair. So, I    turned to Burpee Hybrid for several years. It was better than    Surecrop, but not as good (I later discovered) as Meridian,    Slicemaster, Saticoy, Shamrock, and Sprint. These hardy    cucumbers not only taste great, but they'll also produce    right up until the first frost.</p>    <p>      A cucumber revolution, however, came with the introduction      of the Burpless Hybrid. It's not all that pretty to look      at, but its wonderful mild taste created an unbelievable      demand all over the country. And before too long, that      strain led to the creation of the finest tastin' cucumber      ever developed: Sweet Slice.    </p>    <p>      These smooth, burpless, and delicious vegetables grow up to      eight or nine inches long, and the skin is so thin and      mildly flavored that you don't even have to peel 'em.    </p>    <p>      If you want a good picklin' cucumber, try Pioneer, which      produces a remarkable number of fruits on each vine. The      quality of this hybrid is equal to (or better than) the      more well-known National Pickle. Other highly regarded      hybrid picklers are Piccadilly and Spartan Dawn.    </p>		<h3>TASTY TOMATOES</h3>    <p>      Probably the most publicized hybrid vegetable in the world      is the tomato ... and the most famous in the line is Big      Boy. But, the fact of the matter is that Big Boy was long      ago surpassed by much tastier varieties and survives now      mostly on past achievements. Just a few of the more      toothsome hybrids are Better Boy, Supersonic, Super Red,      Park's Whopper, Redheart, Terrific, Royal Flush, and Wonder      Boy. All of these are disease-resistant plants with large,      meaty fruits.    </p>    <p>      However, if you're lookin' for the ultimate in      mouth-waterin' tomato goodness, Beef master is tops. This      variety grows on a h3, rugged vine which produces one-      to two-pound wonders ... and I just don't see how a tomato      could taste any better than these monsters do!    </p>    <p>      For those of you who require an early maturer, Spring      Giant, Springset, and Early Girl are hard to beat ... and      they'll usually start producing about two weeks before      Beefmaster or Better Boy, too.    </p>    <p>      But, as good as these varieties ate, the real star of early      tomatoes has to be Ultra Girl ... a strain first sold only      a couple of years ago by the Stokes Seed Company. It yields      smooth and delicious fruits which hang in clusters all over      the hardy vine and average seven to eight ounces each. And,      on top of that, Ultra Girl resists all major tomato      diseases!    </p>		<h3>PLUS ALL THESE</h3>    <p>      Cauliflower, broccoli, and brussel sprouts-thanks to      hybriclizationhave become much more widely grown and      accepted by the public in the past few years. In fact, all      the popular varieties of these vegetables are new      crossbreeds.    </p>    <p>      Snow King and Snow Crown are truly outstanding      cauliflowers, while Green Comet and Premium Crop are just      two of a number of new broccoli releases. (Green Comet      probably takes the lead in both taste and production.) Jade      Cross is the best brussels sprout variety. It gives twice      the yield of open-pollinated crops and the quality is      really fine.    </p>    <p>      Even carrots have caught the attention of hybridizers in      the past few years. Old established varieties such as      Nantes, Chantenay, Danvers, and Imperator are now      challenged by new hybrids like Carrousel, Touche, and      Spartan Bonus. The main advantages of these "newcomers" are      uniformity and higher yield.    </p>    <p>      Onions (Aristocrat, Fiesta, Empire, and Spartan Era) have      also benefited from the hybridizer's touch, as have      pumpkins, zucchini, and spinach.    </p>    <p>      No one says, of course, that you should abandon your      favorite old vegetable standbys, but why not make room in      your garden for a few of the delicious and prodigious newer      strains?    </p>    <p>      Then, when somebody tells you that hybrids are nothing more      than flavorless giants, you can sit that person right down      and give him or her a taste of what these recent      crossbreeds are really all about!    </p>
