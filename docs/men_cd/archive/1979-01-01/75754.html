            		<hr />        <p>      In celevration of little-known MOTHER-type folks from all      over.    </p>		<hr />    <h3>      BUZZY SISCO:MAKING PRAIRIE DOLLS    </h3>    <p>      Fifty-year-old Buzzy Sisco has been to. tally disabled      since early childhood ... the victim of a <em>series</em>      of crippling diseases. As a result of Buzzy's bouts with      spinal meningitis, encephalitis, erysipelas, and cerebral      palsy, he cannot read, write, or speak coherently ... but      Buzzy <em>can</em> create!    </p>        <p>      Buzzy Sisco-with the help of his two      sisters-makes a living sewing cotton dolls ...      fashioned from a pre-Civil War family pattern, handed down      from generation to generation. Buzzy crafts his dolls just      as they were made in the days of the covered wagon: Each      toy is made complete except for the stuffing ... which is      left up to the child as a lesson in resourcefulness and      responsibility. The dolls encourage neatness as well,      because each toy has a four-pocketed apron to hold and      organize its young owner's coveted trinkets and treasures.    </p>    <p>      These handmade (no two are exactly alike) dolls are      available in two styles: a girl doll, Gert, and a boy doll,      Bert. Gert boasts pigtails, a ruffled apron, and an      old-time duster hat. Bert features tousled hair, a      cobbler's cap, and shoes which peek out from his plain      cobbler's apron. Each toy is crafted from brightly colored      cotton, burlap, and felt ... with all parts safe for even      the youngest child. And-somehow-the prairie      dolls' ingenious makeup manages to cross every barrier of      race and nationality ... so that each doll is      representative of the people of all the world.    </p>    <p>      Buzzy sells his 10-inch tall homemade playthings for $5.99      each ... and 12-inch dolls for $6.99 (all orders are      postpaid). And a handcrafted, miniature, felt horse      blanket-which can be used as a bookmark or desk/table      ornament-is included as a bonus with every two dolls      purchased. (Buzzy's prairie dolls can be ordered from:      Buzzy Sisco, c/o Sisters Sisco, P.O. Box 148, Healdsburg,      California 95448.)    </p>    <p>      Buzzy's dream is to live on a tract of land that is truly      close to nature ... complete with garden church, bird      sanctuary, animal preserve, and abundant vegetation: a      homestead to house and be tended by the physically and      mentally handicapped. And- with the profits from the      dolls that Buzzy makes and sells- the Sisco family      hopes someday to turn that dream into a reality!      -Bertha M. and Samuelion 0. Sisco.    </p>    <h3>      ROSS AND PAULA SIMMONS: WOOLCRAFTERS    </h3>    <p>      For nearly three decades now, Ross and Paula Simmons have      been literally "weaving the tapestry of their life" against      the background of their small farm homestead on the Kitsap      Peninsula of western Washington. As full-time craftspeople,      Paula and Ross tend an unorthodox flock of black-fleeced      sheep. . . which yield the product that the two spin and      weave by hand into high-quality clothing and artistic      afghans.    </p>        <p>      When the Simmonses first "dropped out" of mainstream      society-shortly after World War II-their      chances for success appeared pretty slim. "We desperately      wanted to get back to a simpler way of life," says Paula.      "But, like most people, we didn't know that making life      simpler is not quite as easy as it sounds." At first the      two were only part-time back-to-the-landers: The tiny      five-acre homestead they'd bought with their accumulated      savings boasted only a few chickens, some rabbits      (invariably set free at butchering time), and a meager      vegetable garden. So, every day, the pair commuted by ferry      to outside jobs in nearby Seattle.    </p>    <p>      "We certainly made a lot of mistakes in our time," Paula      laughs good-naturedly, "but we learned a lot by doing . . .      and- fortunately -we found that some good      eventually comes of everything." A case in point was the      Simmonses' single wandering homestead goat, which the      couple tried in vain to keep from "browsing" through the      hedgerows. Ross and Paula's lack of success with the beast      prompted them to replace the animal with a more docile      black sheep ... and, at the sheep's first shearing, the      couple's down-home thrift compelled them to put the wool to      good use.    </p>    <p>      "When you're living at a subsistence level," Paula      explains, "even your hobbies have to pay for themselves" .      . . so the two eagerly read everything (though there wasn't      much) that was then available on handspinning and      -weaving. Ross then built a lap loom which Paula used      to turn out a dark-wool scarf ... the scarf was sold. . .      and the money was used to buy a larger loom. Ross and Paula      were so attracted by the beauty of the dark wool they'd      woven that they proceeded to buy two old black ewes, which      later lambed. The couple then built up the flock ...      learned the ins and outs of marketing crafts ... and-      finally- entered the weaving business full time.    </p>    <p>      Today, Paula has two successful books on sheep raising and      woolcraft to her credit: <em>Raising Sheep the Modern Way and      Spinning and Weaving With Wool. [Available from any good      bookstore for $5.95 and $9.96 respectively. . . or for the      above prices, plus 950 shipping and handling, from Mother's      Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina      28739.MOTHER.]</em> Paula's spinning and weaving workshops have      also become popular, as have the dark-wool afghans, hats,      vests, and sheepherder's jackets that she and Ross weave.      But-despite the great demand for the couple's woven      products-the two still faithfully devote all the time      and attention that's necessary for creating each and every      piece.    </p>    <p>      Ross and Paula view their life's work together somewhat      philosophically: "The 'good life'," they say, "means doing      whatever it Is that you really want to do." And it's      apparent to all who know them that Ross and Paula Simmons      have been doing just that! -Forest Rambo.    </p>    <h3>      KEN WEBB: SUMMER CAMPS WITH A PURPOSE    </h3>    <p>      In 1940 Ken Webb found himself totally disenchanted with      the existing system of education in Vermont. He'd been      teaching school and working in summer camps for a number of      years ... and was convinced there was a better way of      dealing with youngsters than to dress them in uniforms,      feed them unhealthy foods, and teach them to compete      against each other for the sake of a ribbon or an empty      title.    </p>        <p>      Ken had the idea that children would benefit more      from a noncompetitive environment ... where they could grow      their own food in organic gardens, build their own      shelters, make their own music, and invent their own      amusements. So he moved to Vermont's Plymouth Valley, with      a little money, a lot of energy, and a small group of boys      ... and transformed his Quaker-inspired dream into a      reality: a boys' camp called Timberlake.    </p>    <p>      At first the local folks thought Ken mighty strange when he      openly recruited campers from minority groups (years before      the civil rights movement). And campers' parents were a bit      uneasy about the nonconformist Timberlake diet: The      youngsters grew much of what they consumed and did not eat      the traditional "meat with every meal". But Webb persisted      and Timberlake grew ... and soon Ken and his wife Susan had      established a girls' camp-called Indian      Brook-as well.    </p>    <p>      Soon after, two Indian culture camps developed ... where      youngsters studied the American Indian way of life and      respect for the earth. Then, a fifth Webb venture resulted      in a boys' hiking camp with down-to-earth ecology and      conservation programs. And, finally, Ken set out to      organize a series of environmentally oriented activities      for older teens ... as well as some special programs for      college-aged folks.    </p>    <p>      Today- thirty-eight years and six camps      later-Ken Webb serves as elder/ advisor to the Farm      Wilderness Foundation ... which oversees the operation of      his camps' programs and the administration of camp-owned      grounds. He spends much of his time writing, gardening, and      canoeing over the lake where three of his camps are now      located. Most often Ken visits Timberlake, where it all      began . . . and tells tales to each new group of youngsters      that the summer months bring.    </p>    <p>      Webb calls himself an "incorrigible idealist": "My hopes      for the future spring from the young," he says. And it is      for the young that Ken Webb has invested so much of his      life ... and shared so fully his love of the      earth,-Tom Mcguire.    </p>    <h3>      NEIL J. KELLMAN: ALTERNATIVE M.D.    </h3>    <p>      What's a nice New York doctor like Neil J. Kellman doing in      a backwoods location like Lewis County, Tennessee? It      started when Neil received his M.D. from Albany Medical      College and was invited to set up practice in Lewis      County's local hospital. Neil discovered, however, that      acceptance of that position would require him to join the      AMA and maintain malpractice insurance . . . so he opted,      instead, to create a county clinic and maternity center of      his own.    </p>        <p>      The clinic began (and remains) in an old remodeled      farmhouse ... but was soon equipped with examining quarters      and two maternity rooms designed for homelike delivery.      And, in the first five months of the clinic's operation,      the center's midwives- assisted, when needed, by Dr.      Kaltman- delivered a total of 70 babies. (In addition      to day-to-day treatment and diagnosis, Dr. Neil trains      midwives and lay medical students to help him with his      workload.)    </p>    <p>      Neil Kellman habitually treats health problems in the most      natural way possible ... using herbs, acupuncture, and      other such techniques in an effort to keep shots, surgery,      and drug-oriented treatment to a minimum. (He strongly      believes that acupuncture is a much more effective healing      medium than many conventional medical practices.)    </p>    <p>      Patient care for Dr. Kellman involves educating each      individual in the prevention of disease through proper      nutrition, exercise, and the development of a positive      state of mind. Neil also conducts field trips into the      nearby countryside for people who wish to learn to identify      herbs for both food and healing purposes. And-in a      recent talk at the local Senior Citizens Nutrition      Center-the doctor awakened his audience to the      potential health hazards of highly processed, overcooked,      and inappropriate foods, Neil Kellman is a nonconformist      when it comes to matters of finance, too: His fees are a      reflection of what each patient can afford. And-since      so many elderly folks in the area are caught in the squeeze      between fixed incomes and the inflationary      spiral-senior citizens are treated on a donation-only      basis.    </p>    <p>      What, then, do the folks of Lewis County, Tennessee think      of their resident alternative to the medical establishment?      The community consensus is clear: "Dr. Neil is a gentle man      and a kindred spirit ... with a sheepskin to satisfy the      public, " the folks say. "And here in the heart of middle      Tennessee ... we count him as one of our blessings!      "-Joy Costa.    </p>    <h3>      RIC MOORHOUSE: BLACKSMITH    </h3>    <p>      There were a lot of exhibits crammed into the New Orleans,      Louisiana HerItage Festival two years ago last April: food,      handicrafts, and sometimes even music. But-Ric      Moorhouse stood out as perhaps the most serious of the      exhibitors, for he was displaying the products of a notion      that had led him to a "better way of life" . . . from the      promise of a successful business law career to the life of      a blacksmith.    </p>        <p>      At the age of 25, Ric held a B.S. degree in business      administration from Southern Methodist University in      Dallas, Texas ... and was studying business law at      Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. And then one      day-as he leafed through a craft book given him by a      friend-the name of the Turley Forge School in Santa      Fe, New Mexico suddenly caught his eye. "The idea just      knocked me over," says Ric. But it took him a year in line      on the waiting list- from 1974 to 1975-before      he was even admitted to the six-week program.    </p>    <p>      Ric did complete the course, though, and-with the      basics of the subject under his beltsettled down near      Arnaudville, Louisiana in a house with a small abandoned      blacksmith shop. Then he set up business with the beat      tools available: century-old pieces (two anvils, a      pair of hand-forged tongs, a handcranked air blower,      and a leg vise) obtained from craftsmen of yore who'd      retired or passed on. (Ric's large, steel-faced      anvil-for example -belonged to a blacksmith who      retired back in 1927.)    </p>    <p>      Ric feels fortunate to have two old-time blacksmiths in      nearby communities, men who see their skill as a vanishing      art and are glad to give Ric all the help and advice he      needs as he masters. the trade ... and as the surrounding      farming community comes to depend on him more and more to      fulfill its everyday blacksmithing needs.    </p>    <p>      People still ask Ric what prompted his drastic change from      business law to blacksmithing, and he always answers      frankly. "I'm not at ease in the cold of ten-story, steel,      brick, and concrete structures," says Ric. "I can relate      much better to the soil and to the people who till it ...      and," he adds, scooping up a handful of dirt from the sod      floor of his blacksmith shop, "I don't mind getting my      hands dirty." Press Ric further for a reason for his change      of lifestyles and he'll explain: "It's simply the way the      pendulum swung. It all began as just a notion ... but it      developed into a way of life better than I'd ever planned      for." -D. J. Young.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>Know someone-whether sung or unsung-who's doing      something of merit in wholistic gardening, alternative      energy, environmental conservation, self-employment,      low-cost house construction, or any of the other fields of      endeavor featured in MOTHER?
