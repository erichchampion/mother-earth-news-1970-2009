            		<p>			 <strong>COUNTRY VET</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Elizabeth Barnes, DVM    </h5>    <p>      <strong><em>Consider behavior traits when moving      livestock.</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      An inevitable aspect of raising livestock is the pattern of      relocating them from the farm to a market, to a fair, or to      another farm and back again. The two critical      considerations in livestock transport are the safety of the      handler/owner and the safety of the animals. Knowledge of      animal behavior and of how animals respond to humans will      reduce stress and ensure the safety of both handler and      animals.    </p>    <p>      A brief review of the basics of livestock behavior will      help handlers better work with their animals and better      understand the impulses behind their actions. Cattle      possess a wide panoramic visual field - up to      340Â° in some breeds - and have the ability to see      color.    </p>    <p>      Cattle display body language, and a working knowledge of      these subtle signals is important. Healthy calves and      cattle give a luxurious stretch upon rising from a laying      down position and then relax to a normal posture. Increased      standing or frequent shifting of weight between feet is a      sign of discomfort or discontent.    </p>    <p>      The most reliable clue to a cow's condition is to observe      its tail. The tail will hang loosely straight down when the      cow is grazing, walking calmly, or relaxed but will be      clamped down between the legs when cold, frightened, or      sick. When the tail is held away from the body the cow      feels threatened or is investigating. A galloping cow will      hold her tail straight out from her body; when there is a      kink in the tail, she is in a playful mood.    </p>    <p>      Cattle respect a solid fence and seldom ram or attempt to      run through a solid barrier, unless very upset. Excited      cattle often run through a fence because they are unable to      see it. Place ribbons on the cables or wires to increase      visibility. Behaviors that indicate discomfort for cattle      include attempting to escape, vocalizing, or kicking.    </p>    <p>      When moving cattle, and to a lesser extent sheep, it is      important to understand the concept of flight zone and      point of balance. The flight zone is the animal's personal      space. The closeness of a human that animals will tolerate      depends on their tameness or wildness. Frequent gentle      handling will slowly decrease the flight zone. To determine      the flight zone, slowly approach a group of animals. When      the handler is outside of the flight zone, the animals will      turn and face a handler at a safe distance. When the      handler enters the flight zone, the animals will turn away.      Penetrate the flight zone too deeply and the animal will      bolt, or turn and run past you. The best place to work an      animal or group of animals is at the edge of the flight      zone.    </p>    <p>      The point of balance, at the animal's shoulder, is used to      change direction. To make an animal move forward, the      handler should stand at the edge of the flight zone behind      the point of balance. A few simple steps to the front of      the point of balance will cause the animal to stop and back      up. If an animal is approached head on, it will turn left      if the handler moves to the right and vice versa. The      flight zone is increased when an animal is approached head      on. It is a frequent mistake for handlers to stand in front      of the point of balance and prod the animals forward.      Remembering to work the edge of the flight zone and utilize      the point of balance will ensure calm and successful      movement.    </p>    <p>      Sheep behavior can be summarized in three words: flocking,      following, and vision. Sheep aggregate to form flocks and      they maintain social spacing and orientation even when      confined in pens. Standing sheep will orient themselves      parallel to and facing the same direction as the nearest      neighbor. While laying down, sheep position themselves      parallel to and next to the sides of open-sided pens.    </p>    <p>      Because of the social structure present within a flock,      sheep are able to form stable relationships which have an      important impact on their handling. When an individual      animal is separated from the group, it will run towards the      receding flock regardless of the position of the handler.      As a prey species, sheep respond to the sight of a predator      by flocking and flight. The flight zone is not affected by      flock size or the speed of approach of the predator.    </p>    <p>      Individual sheep tend to possess a larger flight zone than      a flock. The "following" response of sheep is present at      birth and continues throughout the adult life of a sheep.      In addition to following, you will see mutual imitation of      behavior: sheep feed, drink, rest, and ruminate all at the      same time.    </p>    <p>      But leadership also exists within a flock. These individual      sheep do not have presidential aspirations, but move      independently of other sheep and are therefore followed,      setting the pace for the rest of the flock. Sheep possess a      panoramic visual field similar to cattle and also have good      depth perception and the ability to distinguish colors.      Sheep vocalize regularly only in three situations:      separation from the flock, ewe-lamb communication, and ram      to ewe during mating.    </p>        <p>      An individual's response to a handler is a combination of      the animal's previous experiences and temperament. Both      determine the degree of fear when handled or transported.      It is best to start early with cattle and train weaner      calves to become accustomed to humans. Walking quietly      among calves in the pens or corrals over ten days will      acclimate the young animals to the handler's presence.      Cattle and sheep have the ability to remember unpleasant      experiences for twelve weeks to one year. It is important      to remember that few animals are handled only once in their      lifetime. Always treat livestock gently and calmly.    </p>    <p>      As prey species, livestock have a great fear of novelty.      Any unfamiliar condition will cause animals to balk and      halt their forward motion. Solid chutes and gates are most      effective when moving animals because they hide any      distractions outside and reduce wide-angle vision. Cattle,      sheep, and horses will balk at puddles, shadows, changes in      floor texture, and moving objects such as humans, hanging      coats, or swinging chains.    </p>    <p>      Following pigs from behind with a solid panel prevents the      pigs from backing up. Moving livestock towards an area with      better illumination enhances forward flow; all livestock      are reluctant to enter a darker area. Domestic animals are      social and prefer to remain in herds or flocks. The idea of      safety in numbers is as ancient as time itself.    </p>    <p>      Because of this herding tendency, it is easier to move a      group of animals rather than individuals. When animals are      separated they get excited and agitated and are more likely      to injure themselves and the handlers. Many of the serious      cattle handling accidents are due to a lone animal that      goes berserk when separated from its group and attempts to      rejoin its cohorts.    </p>    <p>      When moving animals, it is best to keep existing groups      together. If a group is too large, it can be divided, but      avoid combining animals that are strangers as it can      stimulate aggressive and dominant behavior which is      stressful to the animals and potentially hazardous to the      handler.    </p>    <p>      Cattle and sheep prefer to maintain visual contact with      others in the group. Livestock will follow a leader and      maintain visual and tactile proximity with cohorts when      moving. Because of this, if the lead animal is to balk at      some unknown object, the handler should identify the source      of fear, remove it, and attempt to move the group by moving      the leader. It will cause anxiety, as well as unnecessary      crowding and bunching if the handler attempts to move the      animals from the rear of the group.    </p>    <p>      Transport of livestock involves many inherent stresses for      animals, but we can decrease these. When animals are      accustomed to people, they are calmer. Because isolation is      highly stressful for animals, try to avoid moving animals      individually whenever possible. Stress has been shown to      decrease immune function which increases the susceptibility      to infections. This creates a risk for an animal moved to a      new environment where it may be exposed to animals carrying      strains of viruses and bacteria not previously encountered.      Stress also decreases rumen motility in cattle which leads      to mild indigestion and decreases the production of milk      cows and the growth of beef cattle.    </p>    <p>      Packing density of the animals, an adequate trailer, and      driving technique are also important considerations. When      loaded, sheep and cattle should be able to stand in a      natural position with the roof well above their heads.      There are two theories behind packing density on a trailer.      One is to pack the animals so tight they can't move or      breathe. The other is to leave them plenty of room to move      about. A happy medium between these two extremes is ideal.    </p>    <p>      Cattle behavior during motion is predictable: they stand      perpendicular or parallel to the direction of motion and      tend not to lay down. Loss of balance is the biggest      physical danger during transport - aside from heat or      cold stress - and occurs during braking, gear      changing, and cornering. Smooth travel is the ideal;      highways provide the fewest interruptions during the trip.      The trailer should have a no-slip floor and adequate      ventilation to allow dissipation of body heat.    </p>    <p>      Here's hoping that you and all your animals arrive at their      final destination safe, healthy, and unstressed.    </p>    <p>      Happy Trails!    </p>
