                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY SKILLS</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By M.H. Salmon    </h5>    <p>      <strong><em>Loyal personable hard working. . . and a source      of wonderful milk and cheese.</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      The goat is undoubtedly the most versatile livestock a      homesteader can own. The homestead hog will eat your      garbage and can produce lots of piglets for meat or sale,      but you're not going to milk one or make any money selling      cheese from a pig. Sheep, chickens, rabbits, turkeys,      ducks, and the traditional milk cow all have their      respective uses, but none will provide all of the following      - milk, cheese, meat, brush control - within a      handy one to two-hundred pound package that will also pack      your gear on a hiking trip. The goat is the only animal      named that you could honestly describe as personable. A      homestead goat that's raised right is as loyal, charming,      and companionable as the family dog, and in most cases a      lot more useful.    </p>    <p>      Goats come in a great variety of breeds and strains. They      are perhaps best defined by their three main commercial      uses. Thus we have hair goats (that produce mohair and      cashmere), meat goats (the Spanish goat and the Boer goat      dominate the current market), and milk or dairy goats      (common breeds include the Toggenberg, Nubian, Saanen, La      Mancha, Oberhasli, and Alpine). The hair goat and meat goat      industries are most prevalent in the American Southwest.      Although hair goats and meat goats can be milked,      butchered, or used for packing (my own homegrown goats have      a lot of Spanish blood), most small-farm or homestead goats      are dairy goats.    </p>    <h3>GETTIN YOUR GOAT</h3>    <p>      Since we're assuming that you are just starting out with      the joys of homestead goats, the best goat to start with is      a female (called a doe) that is pregnant. A pregnant doe      will soon give you the priceless experience of birthing and      raising baby goats (called kids), and shortly after that      will provide the family with better milk and cheese than      money can buy, often with some left over for sale. The      breed, in my opinion, is not important. Goat fanciers, like      dog and horse fanciers, like to brag about their breed, and      they will argue the merits of their breed over those of any      other breed. But the fact is that all the dairy goat breeds      mentioned above produce good, hardy, milk-goats that will      yield about a gallon of milk per day and be a pleasure to      have around. Various hybrids and crosses of those breeds      can be just as good. Note, however, that all the breeds      mentioned can produce some real lemons, too, that may be      unhealthy, poor milkers, and hard to handle. Jesse -      bless her heart - is a case in point.    </p>    <p>      My wife and I acquired Jesse because we had an infant son      who, we figured, should have better milk than money could      buy. Once breast milk was no longer an option, we wanted      goat's milk. Goat's milk has smaller, finer fat globules      than cow's milk, making it easier for humans to digest.      Straight from the doe, it will run, on average, about four      percent butter fat, compared to a little over three percent      for store-bought cow's milk. Any milk-drinker will benefit      from goat's mills, but a baby will benefit most. In the      store, however, goat's milk will run two to three times the      price of cow's milk, so we could see the economy in having      our own goat. We scanned the local "shopper" for goats for      sale, and one afternoon went to see Jesse.    </p>    <p>      Our soon-to-be homestead goat was an Alpine/Nubian cross,      bred to a good Alpine male (called a buck), and her mother,      the owner said, produced better than one gallon per day      every time she freshened. This was all good news and the      price for Jesse, who was due to kid any day, was a mere      hundred dollars. This was because "Jesse's a little bit      shy."    </p>    <p>      We went into Jesse's pen and it was clear even to a city      slicker that Jesse was wild as a March hare. If it hadn't      been a small pen we never would have caught her. Jesse's      horns were long and dangerous, but with three people      working hard, we were able to carry her out to the pickup      without anyone getting gored and we tied her down so she      wouldn't destroy the camper shell on the ride home.    </p>        <p>      Within days, Jesse had two healthy kids, both does. In      spite of her goofiness, she proved an excellent mother. She      also produced far more milk than the two kids could use, so      I began to milk her even before the kids were weaned. This      meant herding Jesse into a small pen, roping her      cowboy-style, leading her by force to the milking      stanchion, then tethering her back feet so she wouldn't      kick the bucket over. Even with that, we had plenty of      spilt milk and skinned knuckles before Jesse agreed to be a      milk goat.    </p>    <p>      In time, with patience and kindness, Jesse settled down and      we had a long, productive relationship. Her milk helped      give us the healthiest baby boy you could possibly imagine      (he calls it "goat juice") and I'm sure I did better on it,      too. But there's no need for a novice goat-owner to start      out with a doe like Jesse. Healthy, tractable, good-milking      does are available in any community.    </p>    <p>      Along with your local "shopper," check with your county      extension agent and the local feed store for information      about goats for sale. Take your time, ask questions, and      don't necessarily take the first doe you look at. Most does      come into heat in September or October, and since the      gestation period of a goat is about a hundred and fifty      days, pregnant does will most likely show up from November      through March.    </p>    <p>      You may want to start with a doe but no kids. Milking does      who have weaned their kids will be most prevalent through      the spring and summer. With a little common sense and a bit      of luck, you'll end up with a good doe on the first try.    </p>    <h3>HOUSING AND FENCING</h3>    <p>      Of course, before you bring your goat home, you need to      give some thought to providing space and shelter for this      new member of the family. If you have some acreage, that's      all the better, but a goat or even two or three goats will      do fine in a good sized, fenced-in yard or pen. Goats with      less room to roam will appreciate a walk from time to time      (more on this in the packing section). Chain-link fence      works well, but is too expensive for a large pasture. We      use Keystone Non-Climb fence, sometimes called horse fence,      available at most any lumber and supply yard. It's a heavy      gauge woven wire with two-inch spacing that the goats can't      get their heads through. For larger acreage, standard field      fence, used by commercial sheep and goat raisers, works      well and is also readily available. Fencing should be at      least five feet high. Goats are not hard to confine,      provided they are well fed, healthy, and comfortable. An      unhappy goat is by definition an escape artist.    </p>    <p>      Goats are more heat tolerant than cattle, sheep, or hogs;      in warm weather they need nothing more than shade, water,      and, if indoors, ventilation. In winter they need shelter.      For our New Mexico winters, a lean-to is sufficient. In      northern climates, goats need an enclosure, a barn or shed,      and plenty of straw or wood shavings for some bedding. Most      goats will grow a good winter coat and won't suffer in cold      weather, but you have to keep them dry and out of the wind.      The main impediment these days to keeping a goat is not      weather or the expenses of fencing or housing but rather      the vast array of urban regulation that generally makes      anything listed as "livestock" an illegal animal. Actually,      a goat or two is generally less of a bother to neighbors      and society than the dogs some people raise. Rural      residents shouldn't have any trouble. Urban and suburban      homesteaders will need to learn the rules and obey them.    </p>    <h3>FEED</h3>    <p>      Entire books have been written on the unique digestive      powers and feed needs of goats. Myths abound. Goats don't      eat tin cans or flannel shirts, but they will pull your      clothes off the line for the fun of it. We will necessarily      keep to the basics here.    </p>    <p>      On pasture, goats will eat a little bit of everything.      They'll eat some grass, but most will vary their diets with      leaves, weeds, bark, pine needles, and all manner of brush.      I have a friend who lives in the rainy part of Washington      State. He has two mules and a heifer on six acres of      well-watered pasture. They keep the grass eaten down, but      little by little the pasture was being taken over by brush.      He got a goat and put her on the pasture. Little by little,      the brush is being trimmed away. Such a goat needs nothing      more than water and a mineralized salt block as supplement      to be well-fed and healthy.    </p>        <p>      Most folks, however, will need to feed their goats,      especially pregnant or milking does. The two basic feeds      will be hay and grain, with the emphasis on the hay. A      wether (a castrated male goat), a dry doe, or a buck will      do fine on grass hay. Pregnant or milking does need the      extra protein and nutrition of alfalfa hay, or a      grass/alfalfa mix. One flake of hay per adult goat, fed      morning and evening, is about right. Put it out in a feeder      or hay rack to keep it off the ground. Once the hay gets      dirty, a goat won't eat it. If you start to find clean hay      left over from the last feeding, you can always cut back.      With grain, a wether, buck, or dry doe will do fine on      about a half pound of rolled oats, barley, milo, or cracked      corn per day. A pregnant or milking doe should be fed about      a pound of prepared feed per day (a half pound each morning      and evening). This prepared feed is available at most feed      stores and is generally referred to as "dairy feed." It's a      mixture of grains, about sixteen percent protein, with      added molasses, vitamins, and minerals. Goats should also      have a mineralized salt block available and, of course,      fresh, clean water at all times.    </p>    <p>      Goats will seldom over-feed on hay or browse, but they will      over-feed on grain. With grain or prepared feed, too little      is better than too much. A goat that eats too much grain      may bloat, and a goat with bloat may be in serious trouble.      A goat needs a diet made up mostly of roughage -      browse and/or hay - for a healthy digestive tract.    </p>    <p>      You can greatly reduce the price of hay by buying it by the      ton. You can greatly reduce the price of grain by buying it      bulk at a grain elevator. Get some fifty-five-gallon drums,      clean them out, then load them in the back of a pickup. At      the elevator you pull in under the hopper and fill the      drums. I buy rolled milo in bulk at about half the price of      bagged milo. I buy the prepared dairy feed in fifty-pound      sacks. For one or two goats, small purchases of feed are      fine. I have six adult goats, plus kids. For a real goat      herd, quantity purchases are a must.    </p>    <h3>BIRTHING</h3>    <p>      In our increasingly urban society, some people are      astounded to learn that in order for a goat to produce milk      every year, she must first breed, get pregnant, and have      kids. I'm assuming that you have purchased a bred doe. You      have thus purchased two or more goats for the price of one.      It's more likely "more." Two kids is the most common number      of offspring for a goat. Three is as common as one. Four      kids (good grief?) is uncommon but possible.    </p>    <p>      As the big day nears, some goat owners approach heart      failure over their doe having kids. But goats have been      doing this with no human help whatsoever for thousands of      years with a success rate of well over ninety percent. As      the day nears, the doe should be confined to a small pen or      shelter with good straw bedding. If you can be there when      it happens, fine. But you'll likely get fooled and will      come out one morning to find two kids born, already on      their feet, and nursing. The milk the doe produces for the      first few days is called colostrum - it's thick,      yellowish, sticky, and contains nutrients and antibodies      that are essential for the kids' well-being. It's for them,      not for you.    </p>    <p>      Your big decision at this point is whether to bottle-feed      or let mamma do it. Bottle-feeding produces kids that are      well bonded to humans and you may be able to wean the kids      earlier by having close control of the milk supply. It      means at least four feedings a day for the first few weeks,      however, whether you're in the mood or not. If you chose to      bottle-feed, get the bottle and nipple at the feed store,      separate the doe from the kids, milk the doe, fill the      bottle, and give the nipple to the kids. It may be slow      going at first, but as they get hungry they'll figure out      how to get milk out of that bottle.    </p>    <p>      I'm inclined to let mamma do it. I do, however, spend a lot      of time the first few days with the kids to make them      people-friendly. I talk to them, pet them, put them in my      lap, and just generally try to be a goat. All this is done      with the mother present. If mamma is calm and trusting in      your presence, the kids will pick up on it. Kids that are      bonded right away with people are much easier to handle      later on. Once you've had a Jesse, you won't want to deal      with another goofy goat.    </p>    <p>      At one to two weeks, the kids will begin nibbling hay and      grain. This should be encouraged by giving them fine, leafy      hay and some of that good prepared feed. Feed it to them by      hand whenever possible; it's almost as good as bottle      feeding for making a goat bond to people.    </p>    <p>      The kids can, and should, be weaned at eight to twelve      weeks. At about eight weeks, I begin to separate the kids      from the mother for about half the day. Of course, they      should have good feed available at this time. Soon I have      them separated from the mother all day long, letting them      back together at night. By twelve weeks, you can keep them      separated day and night. The kids are now capable of      keeping themselves fed and healthy on good hay and dairy      feed; the doe's mills is all yours. Later, you can let the      kids and mother back together again. The kids may make a      stab at nursing, but the mother will generally snarf them      off and will be content to let all her milk go into a pail.    </p>    <h3>MILKING</h3>    <p>      Because dairy goats have been bred for milk production for      centuries, they are able to produce far more milk than is      needed to raise a couple of kids. So you can begin to have      homegrown goat milk in the house well before the kids are      weaned.    </p>    <p>      About a week after the kids are born, you can start to      mills the doe twice a day. Don't expect a lot of mills at      first - maybe just a pint or two at each milking.      Once the kids are weaned you will want to milk the doe down      at each milking to maximize production. Before they're      weaned, it's best to leave some each time for the kids,.      Because the kids are nursing every few hours, they will      keep the udder "exercised" for maximum production.    </p>    <p>      You can expect milk production to gradually increase till      it peaks at about three months. A good doe will then give      three to six quarts per day (that's the total for two      milkings) for a four to six-month span before slowly      slacking off during the next breeding period. You'll want      to allow the doe to dry off for a couple of months before      she kids again.    </p>    <p>      The mechanics of the milking process are very important.      Generally when someone says they don't like homegrown mills      from goats or cows, it's not due to the animal but because      of the way the milk was handled.    </p>    <p>      You'll want something in the way of a stanchion where your      doe will be milked at the same time and place every day.      There are books available that will tell you how to build      one (see the bibliography), but for a good, steady doe who      will stand to be milked as a goat should, you can do fine      with nothing more than the following.    </p>    <p>      In a quiet place in your shed or barn, stand and secure a      wood pallet right across from where you plan to place your      milking stool. Lay another pallet on the floor between the      standing pallet and the stool. This is what she'll stand on      while she's being milked. Secure a crossbar where the doe's      head will be while she's being milked. Put a collar and a      leash on your doe, just like on a dog. Lead her into the      slot between the pallet and the milking stool and tie her      to the crossbar with the leash. Leave enough slack in the      leash so she can dip her head to a feed dish. She will now      be standing on the floor pallet, in a slot between the      standing pallet and you, and will be in good position for      milking when you are sitting on the stool. As in saddling a      horse, always work from the same side.    </p>    <p>      Take a grooming brush and brush her down; she'll like that.      Take a wash cloth, get it wet (use warm water if at all      possible), and give the udder a good massage and cleaning;      she'll like that, too. Put a half pound to one pound of      dairy feed (a coffee can makes a good scoop) in the feed      dish; she'll like that best of all. Take a seat on the      stool and you're ready to begin milking a goat.    </p>    <p>      Now how do you get milk to come out of those udders without      getting your hand kicked, the bucket rolled, or the job      taking all morning? It's a lot easier for a beginner to      start with goat who's steady and has been milked before      (remember Jesse!). First, take a nipple between thumb and      forefinger and clamp down. You have thus trapped milk in      the nipple so it can't go back up into the udder. Then      squeeze down with the remaining fingers and - eureka!      - milk comes out of the nipple. Use the other hand to      do the other nipple. Always squeeze out a squirt or two      before you use the bucket; you'll end up with cleaner milk.    </p>    <p>      In time, you'll develop a rhythmic bump, clamp, and squeeze      motion that is very efficient. The main thing is not to      clamp and squeeze the milk glands up in the udder; that may      draw a kick. Once you and your doe are working well      together, you will feel her "let down" a minute or two into      each milking. She is releasing her milk from the udder. The      milk comes faster then, and you have been accepted by a      goat!    </p>        <p>      I'm not a commercial goat keeper, but I can milk out a goat      in five to eight minutes, all the while contemplating      various philosophical themes and listening to <em>Morning      Edition</em> on NPR. Milking is not all that time      consuming, it's just that someone has to do it every      morning and every evening at the same time.    </p>    <p>      You should use a good stainless steel or an enamel-coated      seamless milk pail, so you can get the pail utterly clean      after each use. Once you have the milk in the pail it's      important to get it cooled down as soon as possible. Take      it straight to the kitchen and pour it through a milk      filter into the milk jar. You can buy milk filters at feed      stores and from livestock supply catalogs (see      bibliography). You can also use a coffee filter, but the      flow-through is slow. As soon as you have the milk in the      jar, put it in the fridge. Sweet tasting, quality milk      comes from contented, well-fed goats, a clean milking      operation, and a quick chill of the milk.    </p>    <p>      Personally, I would no more pasteurize our own raw goat      milk than I would cook a steak well done. It's your call.      You can't legally sell raw milk (though people always have      and always will) but you can use it yourself. If you want      to pasteurize your milk, it merely involves heating the      milk to 165°F for fifteen seconds. A home-size      pasteurizer, available again from feed stores and supply      catalogs, makes it easier.    </p>    <h3>CHEESE</h3>    <p>      You will likely end up with more goat milk than you can      drink. The cat will take some, and so will the chickens.      But the best use of the surplus is to make cheese. Goat      cheese is the best cheese in the world. If you don't      believe me, check the price of the stuff in the grocery      store. There are dozens of recipes, but here are two that      have worked well for us.    </p>    <p>      <em>Ricotta Cheese</em>    </p>    <p>      Put one teaspoon of citric acid (granular) in a quarter cup      cool water and dissolve. Add this to one gallon of fresh      milk. Heat the milk to 185°F, stirring often to avoid      scorching. Remove from heat and let set for ten minutes.      The milk will coagulate into very tiny curd particles. Pour      the hot curd and whey into a colander lined with fine      cheesecloth. Use a spoon to gently stir the curds and allow      the whey to go through the cloth. You can control how      creamy or dry you want your cheese at this point. We save      the whey that goes through the cheesecloth for the      chickens. Put the cheese into a covered bowl and      refrigerate.    </p>    <p>      <em>Queso Blanco</em>    </p>    <p>      Heat one gallon of fresh milk to 195°F, stirring often      to avoid scorching. Stir in a quarter cup of vinegar (any      type will do, choose for flavor). Remove from heat and let      set for ten minutes. The milk will coagulate into solid      white curd particles and clear whey. Pour the hot curd and      whey into a cheesecloth-lined colander, lift, and form the      cheesecloth into a bag. Hang for one hour until the curd      has stopped dripping. Store in plastic wrap in the      refrigerator. This is a sliceable, gratable cheese that is      excellent for cooking.    </p>    <p>      There is a ready market for good goat cheese, and while the      health regulations vary from state to state, they are not      as stringent as for the sale of milk With goat cheese      selling at five to ten dollars per pound, you can recoup      some of your costs or even start a small business making      cheese.    </p>    <h3>BUCKS, KIDS, AND MEAT</h3>    <p>      Just starting out with one or two does, you probably won't      want to keep a buck. A buck will eat hay and grain, will      not give any milk, and will stink during the breeding      season. When it comes time to breed your doe, take her to a      buck, pay the stud fee, and leave her for a week or two. A      doe will recycle during the breeding period until bred, or      until the breeding season has passed.    </p>    <p>      The question will arise: what to do with the kids? This can      be a touchy question that you will want to ask yourself      before you end up with a herd of goats. You can't keep them      all, and may not want to keep any. Young does will one day      be milkers and in my experience are readily salable through      "shopper" ads and the like. A usua l price will be      twenty-five to fifty dollars for a weaned doe, three to      four months old. A bred doe or a milking doe will commonly      sell for one hundred to three hundred dollars. Some      registered stock will bring much higher prices than that.    </p>    <p>      Young bucks and wethers can be sold as meat goats, or you      can butcher them yourself. We like cabrito - called      chevon in the East - here at our place, and we      butcher at three to six months. It's not that difficult,      once you know how, but I'm not going to claim it's      pleasant. Bucks over four months should be castrated before      slaughter. If you can't see yourself butchering a goat, or      selling the animal to someone who will, you might want to      think twice about raising goats. Or you might consider      raising and training pack goats.    </p>    <h3>GOAT PACKING</h3>    <p>      This is the latest thing in goat keeping. Goats can be      excellent pack animals. Instead of putting the typical      thirty-five to fifty pound backpack on your shoulders, you      let a goat do the work. A good pack goat will carry at      least twenty-five percent of his body weight (a      two-hundred-pound wether will pack about fifty pounds),      will follow you like a dog, will feed himself along the      trail and around camp, and will be a pleasure to have      around.    </p>        <p>      Any breed will do, but you want a big, leggy goat. Wethers      are preferred as they are as big as a buck but have the      disposition of a doe. Does may also be packed but they are      smaller and carry less weight. Goat packing has given male      goats a new function in the modern world.    </p>    <p>      A detailed discussion of pack goat training is beyond the      scope of this article, but I can tell you that the key to      success is to raise goats that are well bonded to people. A      people-friendly goat will follow you anywhere in the woods      and will work hard with a load rather than be left behind.      When packing with several goats, good packers will not only      stay with you, they will stay with each other, because      goats are natural herd animals.    </p>    <p>      Pack goats work so well they are putting a lot of llamas,      mules, and burros out of business. No other pack animal can      travel rough terrain as well. No other pack animal can feed      himself along the way as well. No other pack animal can      ride in the back of pickup or utility trailer as well. No      other pack animal is as friendly and personable around      camp.    </p>    <p>      Last fall, my wife and I wanted to take our two-year-old      son on his first wilderness camping trip. We had a baby      backpack so we could take turns carrying him, but who would      carry the gear? We used two of our wethers, Spike and      Bravo, and they packed the sleeping bags, the food, the      cooking gear: darn near everything. We packed-in five miles      from the nearest road, camped along a trout stream, caught      fish, had a great time, and packed-out three days later.      The goats did most of the work. It wouldn't have worked      without them. There is a good book on pack-goats by John      Mionczynski. Goat pack-saddles and panniers are available      from several manufacturers (see bibliography).    </p>    <p>      Like I said, the goat is the most versatile homestead      animal. But remember Jesse. I sure do. You want to start      right with homestead goats.    </p>    <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>    <p>      <em>Raising Milk Goats The Modern Way</em> (Storey      Communications, 1990), by Jerry Belanger.
