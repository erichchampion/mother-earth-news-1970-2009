                <p>      <strong>WE TEST THE BEST, PART I</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By John Vivian    </h5>    <p>      <strong><em>The most innovative tools for home, lawn, and      garden.</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      Every few years, MOTHER likes to spot the latest      earth-friendly trends in home gardening and      grounds-keeping, then survey relevant new tools, products,      and services, to see which might be commended to readers.    </p>    <p>      As for trends this spring of 1998 - less than two      years from a new century - we are gratified to note      the recent growth in popularity of both purchased and      home-grown organic foods. These wholesome edibles are      raised the natural way, without toxic pest controls, by      using compost and mulches rather than chemical fertilizers      that degrade earth and that are mostly derived from our      planet's finite petroleum reserves.    </p>    <p>      We are even more pleased. to note that these new, more      <span style="font-style:italic;">Natural Home</span>-planting schemes often replace wasteful      expanses of lawn that are a holdover from hardworking,      egalitarian America's uncharacteristic penchant for      mimicking the estate grounds of Europe's idle, rich, landed      gentry.    </p>    <h3>New Life for Our Least Favorite Tool?</h3>    <p>      As an added benefit, householders who replace their lawns      with native-life meadow or garden can recycle MOTHER'S      least-favorite homeowner machine: the noisy, smoke-belching      rotary-blade lawn mower. These savage devices persist      because, even though pricey and more-safety-conscious      models are available, the average backyard specimen is sold      for about $100 - a fraction of the cost of the more      effective and much safer powered reel-mower. The      inefficient throw-away engines of these cheap mowers      pollute our air and make a racket. Their 2,500 rpm      revolving blades can eject rocks at virtually bullet      velocity. Their tiny wheels and a low pancake shape make      them tend to flip or slide on uneven terrain and hills. It      is too easy to slip a foot under one on slick, wet grass.      Operated in the typical, macho, American way -      without heeding, or so much as reading, safety directions,      and bypassing inconvenient safe-operating controls -      rotaries are indirectly responsible every year for      thousands of limb-maiming injuries. When operated around      small children, they're even more dangerous.    </p>    <p>      To give these mowers a fair shake, we purchased an example      of the industry's best effort at producing a safe rotary.      On sale at a major chain department store, it was made by      an anonymous member of the evershrinking number of North      American lawn-equipment makers, and its safety and      convenience features brought the cost to better than four      times the price of the basic El Cheapo rotary. For the      added bucks, we got a cast-metal housing, a clean-burning,      quiet, and powerful Tecumseh engine, self-propelled front      wheels, high rear wheels, the option of mulching or bagging      the clippings, and an electric key-start. The machine      rolled out of the box ready to raise the handle, add oil,      gas up, and go. Before going out to mow, we gave it the      preventive-maintenance treatment described in more detail      below.    </p>    <p>      On flat and level ground, the mower proved to cut short      grass well in both the mulch and bag modes, and the powered      wheels and electric start reduced the effort needed to a      minimum, though turning the wide, heavy deck was difficult      in close quarters. Fresh grass cuttings mat down into an      impenetrable sheet-mulch that deters weeds and attracts      fishing worms to the surface all summer. It then      biodegrades into soil nutrients over winter.    </p>    <p>      This type of mower is as safe and quiet as man can make it.      With a wire-bale deadman ignition switch, automatic blade      clutch, and key-start on the handle, an operator never has      the opportunity to get a hand near the revolving blades. A      heavy rubber skirt at the rear of the housing keeps feet      from sliding under. The muffler on the efficient,      clean-burning, four-cycle engine is remarkably effective;      the engine purrs.    </p>        <p>      A broad, four-point stance and high rear wheels let the      mower sail on flat lawns and it navigates fairly well over      the many bumps, ruts, pits, and ditches that kids, pets,      livestock, tractor, cordwood truck, and garden equipment      excavate in any proper country backyard. Cutting short      grass was fine, but in the bagging mode, the discharge      opening clogged up in half high, wet grass, threatening to      choke the engine down. Cutting six-inch-high grass in      mulching mode, it simply clogged and quit. Fortunately, the      safety features force an operator to stop the engine and      halt the blade before trying to clear the clog, and the      electric key makes a restart so easy that not even the most      resolute King of the Hill should be tempted to try to      defeat the safety features.    </p>    <p>      In sum, this safest and most advanced of homeowner rotary      mowers is suitable only for flat, level lawns free of rocks      and sticks and kept golf-green-short from first greenup in      spring to hard frost in the fall. Of course, that's what      they are designed for: to manicure nice, big, land-wasting      suburban lawns.    </p>    <p>      They have little place on a real country homestead; they      certainly provide no function that justifies their cost.      Know anyone who wants an overpriced mower?    </p>    <h3>A Safe Country-Mowing Machine</h3>    <p>      A small lawn can be kept in trim most safely and cheaply      with an old-fashioned hand-propelled reel mower. Being      manufactured again, new versions of the old, prerotary      designs are being sold today by the mail-order garden-tool      merchants and homestead outfitters, and by a few seed      catalogs. Prices range from about $100 - the cost of      a basic rotary - to twice that. On short grass, a      sharp and properly-adjusted reel-mower hums sweetly as it      works. You'll hum sweetly too - but only so long as      the reel is sharp and properly aligned to a well-honed      cutter bar.    </p>    <p>      Don't try to sharpen it yourself. You'll ruin the reel      trying to sharpen it with a flat file and you'll cut your      fingers trying to hold a well-oiled reel in place with one      hand while you file with the other. You might also damage      the cutting edges or bend the curved blades trying to jam      the reel in place with a stick or whatever is handy. Before      you get a hand-push reel mower, be sure there's an      old-timer in town with a Belsaw and the skill to sharpen      both the straight cutter bar and the compound curves of a      mower reel.    </p>    <p>      Power-mowing and much more - without the need to      sharpen anything - can be performed most easily and      safely with MOTHER's nomination for the most innovative      country-homeplace land-care machine of the late twentieth      century: the wheeled trimmer-mower. It is best exemplified      by the DR, popularized by Country Home Products of      Vergennes, Vermont, and closely copied by several other      firms who knew a good idea when they saw one.    </p>    <p>      With these machines, a twenty-inch or so swath of      vegetation is cut by four lengths of one-eighth-inch thick      nylon cord that revolve parallel to the ground at high      speed. The machine is powered by a modern, quiet,      low-emissions four-cycle gasoline engine mounted on a      sturdy chassis that is supported by a pair of      sixteen-inch-high wheels. They operate on the same      principle as the hand-carried string trimmer - a      little, shrieking, two-cycle engine on a pole that whirls a      length of fishing line to snip off grass around trees and      foundations that a mower can't reach. Yet the motorized,      wheeled trimmer-mower is in fact an entirely different      class of tool, having more in common with a heavy-duty,      flexible, flail-type brush-cutter.    </p>    <p>      We purchased a top-of-the-line, electric-starting,      six-horsepower DR Trimmer-Mower. We bought it at full price      and anonymously - as is the case with all products      cited in this article and most others reviewed by MOTHER.      We gave it hard use in several natural landscaping locales      over a variety of terrain and weather conditions during      1997. It proved easy to operate, effective, and -      best of all - safe, in home-mowing conditions ranging      from a small, closely-trimmed front lawn, to meadows,      woodland paths, clearings, and the moderately dense mixed      meadow-brush on the rutted and hilly "back forty."    </p>    <p>      Though not promoted as a fine-lawn mower, the DR proved      able to trim our country-lawn grass as neatly and evenly as      any rotary - though not to the perfect putting      surface of a reel-mower. And, unlike any kind of lawn      mower, it can trim right up to tree trunks or building      foundations, under fences, and close to tender ornamentals      or vegetable plants.    </p>    <p>      Unlike any reel or rotary we've used, it handily cut      waist-high grass and meadow weeds evenly and close to the      ground, wind-rowing the cuttings into a narrow row to the      right (the already-cut side) of the mowed swath. With      another quick pass, we were able to kick the cuttings over      as often as was needed to dry and cure them-even if rained      on. This let us make hay that would keep well, on a      limited, hand-work, homestead basis. Small scale hay-making      is possible otherwise only with a hand-scythe or a powered      sicklebar cutter, plus turning rakes and pitchforks. Using      these tools takes a terrible toll on modern spines and back      muscles, because they are not used to preindustrial      hay-mowing techniques.    </p>    <p>      To date, no wheeled trimmers are self-propelled; they must      be pushed. They are not feather-light machines. However,      the DR's high wheels, good balance, ability to pivot in its      own length, as well as its unique ability to cant the deck      over its axle and wheels, permitted us to mow uneven      terrain and hills fairly easily. It did this without the      danger of the sliding or flipping posed by rotary mowers      and without the dreadfully hazardous - but      little-publicized - tippiness of self-propelled,      heavy-duty walking or riding tractors with rotary-mower      attachments.    </p>    <p>      To our countryfied standards, the trimmer-mower can do      anything a conventional lawn mower and stringer combo can.      It also does a great deal that the combo can't. The      trimmer-mower will cut herbaceous plants and tender young      tree sprouts, but draws the line at woody stems. In cutting      down pasture, I carry a hand-pruner to nip off the more      mature tree seedlings and the occasional woody old      goldenrod stem.    </p>    <h3>Cutting Bigger Game</h3>    <p>      For woodland paths, badly-overgrown roadsides, and pasture      margins where encroaching stands of popple or sumac have      gotten a root-hold, we use the thirty-year-old Gravely L      with the brush-hog-type, thirty-inch rotary mower      attachment and its ten-pound blade. It is still being made      to fit today's Gravely walking tractors. The DR answer to      heavy undergrowth is their Field and Brush Mower, a      self-propelled workhorse with a fourteen horsepower engine      and heavy mowing blade. Either of these mechanical brutes      - and similar heavy-duty mowers from other walking      tractor and tiller-makers - will whack off any young      tree they can bull down. Anything they can't cut down calls      for a chain saw.    </p>    <h3>A Saner Hand-held Model</h3>    <p>      If you don't own a conventional hand-held string-trimmer,      you've surely seen and heard them. They feature a ground      level string head revolving at the bottom of a steel tube      handle that contains a flexible shaft powered by a little      two-cycle engine that burns a mix of oil and gasoline. It      runs at high rpms, belches oily smoke, and produces a      high-pitched shriek just a few inches from the operator's      ear. They're ghastly little machines. Most of them are now      illegal in California and other locales concerned with the      environment.    </p>    <p>      A power head on a long shaft is an excellent idea -      if it carries a quiet, clean-burning engine and offers a      variety of attachments that benefit from being handheld at      the end of a long shaft, such as a tree-trimmer or      snow-remover.    </p>    <p>      We discovered just such a machine being made, mostly in      America, by Ryobi Outdoor Products of Chandler, Arizona.      Their Trimmer Plus features a small but powerful four-cycle      engine with a separate oil sump and low-pitched exhaust. It      runs cleanly and quietly enough to satisfy all clean-air      regulations. This unique product has been available since      1994. A new commercial line will be introduced in 1998, but      hasn't been as widely publicized as it deserves. We      discovered factory-reconditioned units being sold at a      discount at our favorite tools discounter, Harbor Freight,      of San Francisco. We ordered the reconditioned power head      and a string-trimmer attachment for $100 and change. At      Sears, we found a $30 blower attachment to get fall leaves      to the compost pile and blow dry snow off the walk We also      sent for a $109 snow blower, to remove dense snow from      small areas, direct from Ryobi. A rotary-disk garden      cultivator, hedge trimmer, and other accessories are      available at a fraction of the cost of units with dedicated      engines.    </p>        <p>      We can't think of a better suite of outdoor power tools for      someone living on a small, mobile-home-sized property      - with too much lawn and garden to do by hand, but      too little to justify a full-sized mower, tiller, and snow      blower. We found that the Ryobi four-cycle engine starts      easily, runs economically with a lean exhaust, and produces      a purr rather than a two-cycle yowl. The attachments      perform more capably than their small size would suggest,      and the whole rig can be hung in a closet. Be sure the fuel      is emptied back into your gas can and the engine is run dry      before storing indoors.    </p>    <p>      The only feature that concerned us is the most common weak      point of garden tractors, tillers, and other home-grade      power heads with multiple power-driven attachments: the      connector that joins the engine-drive and accessories.      Ryobi's split drive shaft is a long one. It makes the      connection by inserting a two-inch-long, square-edged,      hardened-steel jack on the power end into a mirror-image      sleeve on the accessory shaft. If the parts are kept      lightly greased and the connection is made as instructed,      with an extra 90° twist, the joint will be tight and      strong. They have redesigned, simplified, and strengthened      the cylindrical clamp that surrounds and secures the joint      around its outside, where the outer shaft-housings connect.      If the attachments are affixed according to the      instructions, the tools should serve for many years. If you      try to rush, and the outer housings are misaligned or the      power-shaft jack is only partly inserted into the      accessory-shaft socket, your machine, at best, could end up      in the factory reconditioning shop. You'll have your money      back, but you'll be out another modern example of      appropriate technology.    </p>    <p>      As with the other machines, we went over the Ryobi's      chrome, painted, and nonvinyl plastic surfaces with Nu      Finish. We lightly oiled and greased the surfaces of the      few exposed hinge-pins and cables. Other than keeping the      split-shaft connection well greased, we wouldn't suggest      lubricating the power shaft or gearing any more thoroughly      or often than the instructions indicate.    </p>    <p>      When we developed a need for a small power-cultivator and      tiller, we considered ordering the rotary-cultivator for      the Ryobi. We finally questioned whether a four-foot-long,      quarter-inch, flexible power cable should be asked to grind      away at our rocky soil for hours on end.    </p>    <p>      We don't doubt that the Ryobi cultivator can do as      promised: cultivate already-prepared soil. But, unless we      wanted to do a great deal of hand-digging every year, we      needed a real mini-tiller to make soil from sod in the many      niche-garden vegetable beds we have, scattered among the      rocks, ornamentals, and tree roots.    </p>    <h3>Garden Power for the Small Place</h3>    <p>      You've seen ads for the Mantis: a pair of chrome handles on      a small engine located low to the ground that powers a set      of spiky disk tines with a short, robust drive system. It      is so light that the ads show it being carried by a petite      lady gardener.    </p>    <p>      Like the DR, you can get a video of the machine and its      accessories in action by calling a toll-free number (see      Sources). Prices are similar to mail order and lower than      you might expect. Low enough, in fact, to keep hundreds of      thousands selling; they are perfect for tending narrow      flower-borders and the small vegetable-plots that are all      that many people have time to tend.    </p>    <p>      Even more convincing than the video is the machine itself.      It assembles in minutes. It needs a mix of gas and oil for      a two-cycle engine that is clean enough to satisfy even the      strict California environmental regulations. It starts      easily, is quieter than most two-cycles, and will eat up      anything you feed it - if you give it time to chew.      Because it is light enough to carry around easily, and      featherweight when tilling, the Mantis is an ideal      compromise between a weeding hoe and a big $2,000 rotary      tiller and power-composter.    </p>    <p>      We tested it, John Henry-like, against our favorite hand      tools. With a minimum of guidance, the Mantis will convert      lawn into fine, loamy garden soil in less time than it      takes to dig and chop finely by hand. It will do this with      substantially less sweat and fewer blisters and bug bites.      It won't cut through thick tree roots or extract big rocks,      but neither will any garden machine short of a Farmall H      with a subsoiler or our thirty-year-old Gravely L with its      seven horsepower, quarter-of-a-Model-A engine and rotary      plow. But the Farmall is a full-sized farm tractor, and the      Gravely and plow are a shoulder-wrenching definition of      overkill on anything smaller than a quarter-acre garden.    </p>    <p>      The Mantis works best when worked gently backwards, against      the forward momentum of its tiller blades. It is most      effective milling up already prepared soil to two-inch to      three-inch depths, but given time, can get down a foot or      more into fresh sod - deeper than any full-size      rotary tiller. We applauded the Mantis in an earlier      article, so we will merely add that this is one tiller that      anyone really <em>can</em> operate with just one hand.    </p>    <p>      As with the DR, there are other makes of small      tiller-cultivators and most of them function well. Some are      copies of the Mantis design, and some have been around for      decades - far longer than Mantis itself. We hope to      test a few in issues to come, but we think we owe our      respect to the little Pennsylvania mail-order firm that had      the gumption to invest in the engineering to produce a      superior product and that had the marketing vision to make      us aware of the usefulness of a mini-tiller in the first      place.    </p>    <h3>Return of the Wheel Hoe</h3>    <p>      If you do have a garden that can be measured in fractional      acres, you are running a de facto truck garden and will be      cultivating more soil than a hoe or a Mantis can handle.    </p>        <p>      To break ground you'll surely want a small tractor or big      tiller. But for less power-intensive small farming chores,      we are pleased to note the reappearance of hand-pushed      wheel hoes. Designed originally in the horse-farming days,      they were sized to cultivate plots that were too big for      hand-hoeing and too small or closely-planted to warrant      harnessing the horse and setting up the cultivator.    </p>    <p>      The wheel hoe is patterned on the old-time horse-drawn      cultivator. In some places a pony, a wether goat, or even a      large dog is single-tree harnessed to the frame and trained      to ease the work load. The tool features a pair of      plow-handles leading down to a mini-draw push bar, to which      you can attach a small moldboard plow, disks, or arrays of      several kinds of cultivators: hilling plows, spades,      spikes, hooks and more. A wheel - either a yard-high      bicycle-spoked wheel (in the high-wheeled Kentucky design),      or a six-inch to eighteen-inch diameter wheel with iron rim      and spokes, or a solid-steel rubber-tired wheel (in the      original Planet Junior low-wheel pattern) - is out in      front of the tools and hung to keep the frame just off the      soil while the tools bite as deep as you like.    </p>    <p>      Without the help of a beast, you adjust the tools on the      bar to plow or disk one or two furrows or to cultivate      between as many rows as possible. You try to accomplish, in      a single pass, as much as is reasonable with your own      muscles. In most soils, you must dig the tools) in and roll      the wheel hoe forward, then pull it back on the wheel and      push forward again as far as you can manage. An acre or two      of this constant back-and-forth labor does build up your      back, shoulders, and arms.    </p>    <p>      In light soil, or by taking shallow passes, you can keep      going forward fairly steadily. You'll resort only      occasionally to short back and forth agitation. A wheel hoe      is ideal for light weeding with sweeps; it has rectangular      or right-angled, knife-like blades that are set to run just      under the soil surface. Some years back, we were blessed      with a reasonably flat two-acre field of rich organic loam      that had lain fallow for twenty-five years. Once it was      plowed, disked, and well-rototilled, I used an original      Planet Junior low-wheeler and sweeps to hand-cultivate      - three to five times, till weeds were shaded out      - a three-year rotation of corn, field peas, and      beans, and rye or buckwheat. I planted the larger seed with      an old Planet Junior seed drill. And even farther in the      past, I inherited an even older high-wheel hoe with three      curved, fishhook crook-tines rusted for all eternity into a      triangular formation on the tool bar. It squeaked and      wobbled on its worn iron axle, but managed to scratch out a      decent foot-wide path between rows in the field corn. It      was faster and better than hand-hoeing but not by much. The      tall wheel tended to lever up off the ground and defeat its      purpose by burying the tools if I had to push hard on the      handles, whereas a low-wheeler helps support the tools and      move them along in the row if a hard push is required. I      hear that this has something to do with the fulcrum of      leverage, angle of moment, and point of effort of the      high-wheeler being well out in front of the tools, while      the low-wheeler's is down low where it belongs. I didn't do      well enough in physics to explain it any better than that.    </p>    <p>      You'll find one or another wheel hoe, as well as new,      original-design Planet junior seed drills, listed in the      homesteading and garden tools catalogs. There is also a      superior quality low-wheel design made of stainless steel      by the Swiss firm REAL (Ray'AL), which also makes a line of      premium-grade hand tools that are cited in the second part      of this article. Sold in several seed and tools catalogs,      it features one or two wheels and oscillating stirrup hoes,      as well as the usual assortment of cultivators. The Real is      a lovely machine offering a high-tech interpretation of an      old-fashioned concept. It runs on ball bearings and costs      well over $200.    </p>    <p>      However, out of a preference for older technology, we opted      for the Planet Junior. It has solid-iron wheels with no      bearings at all; the axle turns inside a nylon sleeve. Its      tool bar and implements of cast iron and tool steel are      painted garish red and yellow; the handles are made of      American ash or hickory. It costs even more than the Real.      It is made by Denman & Company of Placentia,      California. It can be purchased through Lehman's.    </p>    <p>      This crudely-cast and remarkably heavy eighteenth-century      device is not assembled. That's for precision things like      Swiss watches and wheel hoes. The Planet Junior is bolted      together with plenty of axle grease on the fasteners where      implements fasten to the tool bar. Then the whole thing is      oiled against rust - even if it does get coated all      over with greasy dust. Once the nylon sleeve-bushing wears      out, we'll have to pour a new bearing from Babbit metal, or      hard wheel-bearing grease will be worked into cotton that      will be packed all around the wheel axle and held in place      with a pair of washers. The bearing will have to be renewed      once or twice during the year.    </p>    <p>      This is the sort of tool that old-time farmers left at the      end of the last row to sit outside for the winter, only to      hitch up the next spring, turn around, and work back in the      other direction. With an annual greasing, it was sturdy      enough to last through a lifetime of rain and snow -      weather be damned!    </p>
