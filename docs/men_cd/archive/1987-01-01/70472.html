                    <p>      <em><strong>A packet of seed today. . . a bountiful harvest      tomorrow.</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      About the only way most ardent gardeners manage to get      through the winter months-when most of last year's      carefully tended beds are buried in snow or mired in      mud-is by curling up with a bunch of seed catalogs      and dreaming about the coming spring's bigger and better      gardens. The whole family gathers around the supper table      and oohs and ahhs over the glossy pictures of early carrots      dug young and sweet, and shining greens fairly singing with      life.    </p>    <p>      The backyard grower, thank goodness, can raise tomatoes      that practically ooze with flavor . . . melons perfectly      suited to an area's climatic quirks . . . succulent foods      that don't even exist in supermarkets . . . and even such      exotics as red carrots and blue potatoes! And, surely, half      the pleasure provided by such flavor-packed, site-specific,      and unusual varieties is the self-satisfaction that comes      with <em>discovering</em> them.    </p>    <p>      So, to ease your pregarden doldrums, we've prepared a list      of the major seed companies that supply catalogs. Then, for      good measure, we've added the names of some less well known      companies. Write to any of the firms in the list below      (don't forget to add the charge for postage if one is      indicated), and you'll receive a veritable book of dreams.    </p>    <p>      Then, once you've finished going through your catalog      collection and laying out the umpteenth possible plan for      your 1987 garden, it'll be nigh onto planting time!    </p>
