                		<h5 id="byline">By Tom Turner </h5>  <h3> Monkeying With Endangered Species</h3>        <p>      The Endangered Species Act is the most important law in the      world if you happen to be a condor, say, or a Florida      panther.    </p>    <p>      The statute protects rare animals, birds, and      plants-from hunters, in some cases, but more often      from developers who would so alter habitat that it can no      longer support the species. For that reason, it's also very      controversial: Every time the law comes up for renewal,      it's opposed by powerful interests who don't want some      little fish or flower to stand in the way of a new mine,      highway, dam, or string of condos.    </p>    <p>      Their principal weapon is ridicule. A few years ago, the      star of the drama was a tiny fish known as the snail      darter. Its rarity delayed the construction of the Tellico      Dam on the Little Tennessee River-a dam that should      never have been built, snail darter or no snail darter. But      the fish got the blame. Before that, a flower called the      furbish lousewort held up the building of a dam in Maine.    </p>    <p>      This year, Senator Lloyd Bentsen is picking on the Concho      water snake, which, if officially "listed" by the Fish and      Wildlife Service, could hinder the building of the Stacey      Dam and Reservoir in the senator's home state of Texas.      Construction of the dam and reservoir would probably lead      to the snake's extinction, because the rest of its habitat      has already been ruined by dams and reservoirs.      Nonetheless, Senator Bentsen is holding renewal of the      Endangered Species Act hostage at the behest of those      pushing for the Stacey project.    </p>   <h3>Justice Rehnquist and the Land</h3>    <p>      Much has been made of the civil-rights record of William      Rehnquist, the new chief justice of the United States, but      his environmental record hasn't been examined in much      detail. To those who dream of a Supreme Court sensitive to      environmental concerns, the prospects aren't pretty.    </p>    <p>      I recently interviewed 18 leading environmental lawyers and      legal scholars around the country for a long piece on      environmental law. Among the questions I asked was, "Which      legal decision has been most damaging-most difficult      to live with in the practice of environmental law?"    </p>    <p>      The most common answer was, "Vermont Yankee." The author of      that opinion was the Honorable Justice William Rehnquist.    </p>    <p>      The impact of Vermont Yankee is hard to overstate. At the      time-the mid '70s-the courts were busy      interpreting the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970.      NEPA requires federal agencies to study the environmental      effects of a proposed project and to examine alternatives      to it.    </p>    <p>      In the early '70s, the Vermont Yankee Power Company wanted      permission to build two big nuclear reactors to supply      electricity to its customers. The Natural Resources Defense      Council filed suit, claiming that Vermont Yankee had      submitted insufficient documentation to the Nuclear      Regulatory Commission to support its license request: The      documents failed to examine the environmental effects of      the entire fuel cycle (uranium mining, fuel fabrication,      plant operation, and waste disposal), and they didn't      consider energy conservation as a possible alternative to      building the plants in the first place.    </p>    <p>      The court of appeals agreed, ruling that the Nuclear      Regulatory Commission must examine the fuel cycle and      investigate energy conservation as an alternative. It      implied, as well, that the NRC should choose conservation      if it proved to be superior.    </p>    <p>      This was an expansive reading of NEPA, and, had it stood      the test of the high court, the practice of environmental      law would be much different today.    </p>    <p>      But it wasn't to be. The Court, led by our new chief      justice, slapped down the court of appeals, ruling that it      had overstepped itself considerably. Agencies, the Court      said, have no power to do more than the absolute minimum      Congress spelled out in NEPA. They must investigate      alternatives, but they are under no obligation to choose      one over another, despite its benefits. In consequence,      NEPA is a procedural statute only-useful for delaying      and improving projects but powerless to stop bad projects      altogether or to force agencies to make the most      environmentally benign choice.    </p>    <p>      Later, in a famous death penalty case with important      environmental implications, Justice Rehnquist wrote that in      most cases an agency can't be sued successfully for not      doing something it has the power to do under its rules and      regulations. This hamstrings outsiders from forcing      recalcitrant agencies to do their jobs as well as possible.    </p>    <p>      So here we have a chief justice who has ruled again and      again that agency decisions shall stand-an odd      position for a judge appointed by a president who has been      rather scornful of the federal bureaucracy in his day.    </p>    <h3>Forest Service: "Build More Roads!"</h3>        <p>      The Forest Service announced its long-range plans for our      national forests in September, and environmentalists let      out a cry of shock. The Service intends to double the      amount of timber cut annually and to build an incredible      580,000 miles of new roads by 2030. By comparison, 343,000      miles of roads now crisscross the national forests. (The      entire interstate highway system comprises just 40,000      miles!) Environmentalists tried to apply Gramm-Rudman to      the Forest Service's road-building budget in Congress but      were outmaneuvered by western senators.    </p>   <h3> World Resources 1986</h3>    <p>      Finally, we alert you to an extraordinary encyclopedia of      information on the international environment. It's the      first in what is projected to be an annual series of such      reports, and it's packed with charts, graphs, and numbers,      numbers, numbers. There are essays on such topics as world      population, human settlements, food and agriculture,      forests and rangelands, wildlife and habitat. But the heart      of the report is its data, which make it an enormously      useful tool for research and understanding. <em>(World      Resources 1986,</em> by World Resources Institute and      International Institute for Environment and Development,      edited by Donald Hinrichsen, Basic Books, 1986, $16.95.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Tom Turner, a writer and editor who's worked in the      environmental field for 17 years, is with the Sierra Club      Legal Defense Fund, an independent environmental law firm      that represents many organizations across the country. It      is supported principally by private donations. For more      information, write Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, 2044      Fillmore St., San Francisco, CA 94115.</em>    </p>
