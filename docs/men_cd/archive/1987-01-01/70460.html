        <h3>Heated With Compost</h3><p>A fresh compost pile in a home greenhouse can provide heat and CO 2 , increasing both the yield and vigor of indoor plants. And maintaining a hot heap doesn't have to be a grueling chore.</p><p>Bob Kornegay worked out the secrets of greenhousing with compost in two winters of gardening in the multipurpose green-house/bioshelter at MOTHER'S Eco-Village. In Bob's design, compost bins were built directly under his plant beds, so that the pile's heat would warm soil instead of air. That way the plants kept growing well even on the coldest winter days.</p><p>The carbon dioxide given off by the pile removed a common limitation on greenhouse plant growth-lack of atmospheric carbon for photosynthesis. (An unvented greenhouse can use up all available CO 2 , by midmorning.) The end result: Bob's crops produced more prolifically than ever and were so healthy they had <em>no</em> pest problems. If you've ever raised crops in a greenhouse yourself, you'll appreciate what an achievement a nobug greenhouse is!</p><p>Having to start a new compost pile every time an old one cools down is a big chore. But Bob soon learned that if he mixed fresh manure or calcium nitrate into a cooling pile, the extra nitrogen would boost bacterial activity. The pile would "kickstart" itself and give off lots of heat for a couple more weeks.</p><p>Bob solved another problem: ammonia. When a pile first heats up, it releases ammonia gas, which can wipe out crops in a closed-in greenhouse. Bob's answer was to build only one <em>new</em> compost pile every winter (his kickstart technique was the key to that), and to construct it before the weather got cold so he could vent the greenhouse thoroughly during the ammonia stage. With those problems licked, Bob found indoor composting to be a key to indoor growing success.- <em>PS.</em></p><h3>Research Briefs</h3><p><strong>Treat roots right.</strong> A Third World horticultural worker used an innovative technique to transport over 300 bare-root fruit trees from the U.S. to Africa with no losses. He dipped the roots in water to remove dirt, sprayed them with a 1:1 mix of <em>hydrogen peroxide</em> and water, and covered the roots <em>(not</em> the tops) with plastic bags for shipping. The peroxide apparently released oxygen for root use and might help increase the survival rate of any bare-root transplants.</p><p><strong>The BT gene?</strong> Scientists at Plant Genetic Systems in Belgium report that they have successfully incorporated a gene from the biological bacterial control Bacillus <em>thuringiensis</em> into tobacco plants. Caterpillars that ate leaves of plants with the BT gene became paralyzed within 48 hours and died within three days.</p><p><strong>Ionize your tomatoes!</strong> Greenhouse trials have shown that a high density of <em>negatively</em> charged ions in air (generated by high-voltage ion emitters) can result in fastergrowing, earlier-maturing, and higher-yielding tomato plants. The ion-exposed tomatoes generally had higher concentrations of vitamin C and minerals . . . and were judged better-tasting, to boot.</p><p><strong>Good crabs.</strong> Ornamental crab apples can make excellent low-maintenance landscape plants, but only a <em>few</em> varieties show significant disease and pest resistance. According to recent trials, Donald Wyman, Ormiston Roy, and Snowdrift resist scab, cedar-apple rust, powdery mildew, and plum curculio damage. The first two varieties resist fire blight, as well.</p><p><strong>Oak away potato beetles.</strong> Researchers at the University of Rhode Island have found that alcohol extracts of white oak leaves and bark (particularly the bark) inhibit feeding by Colorado potato beetles. Apparently, the tannin in the oak parts completely stops beetle feeding even when it's applied in very small amounts.</p><p><strong>Save lawn water.</strong> Some Kentucky bluegrass varieties use 50% more water than others. Test results from the University of Nebraska indicate that Enoble, A-20, Adelphi, Newport, and Baron bluegrass need a lot less water to prosper than South Dakota, Bristol, Bonnieblue, Nugget, Majestic, Birka, Sydsport, and Merion.</p><h3>Gleanings</h3><p>The 56-page booklet <em>Garden Plants Valuable to Bees</em> ($3.60 postpaid from International Bee Research Association, Hill House, Gerrards Cross, Bucks SL9 ONR, United Kingdom) lists over 400 garden bee plants, with descriptions, culture, and flowering periods . . . . Hortopaper biodegradable mulch-made from paper fibers and peat moss-can be tilled into the soil at the end of the growing season. A 32' X 50' roll costs $14.95 postpaid from Hortopaper Systems, Ashland & 99 Business Park, 4111 N. Motel Dr., Suite 101, Fresno, CA 93711 . . . . The entertaining videotape "Get Ready, Get Set, Grow!" encourages children to garden while teaching basic botany and gardening methods. The video, complete with the 40-page <em>Kid's Guide to Good Gardening</em> and a parent's handbook, costs $29.95 from Brooklyn Botanic Garden (1000 Washington Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11225), which has had a children's garden for over 70 years . . . . The new International Herb Growers and Marketers Association will serve as an information clearinghouse for commercial herb growers and marketers. Contact Liz Roberts, IHGMA Executive Secretary, P.O. Box 693, Greenfield, IN 46140, for membership information . . . . LISTS (Lawn Institute Special Topic Sheets) describing recently introduced grass varieties that need less fertilizer, less insect and disease control, and even-yes-less mowing are available free with a self-addressed stamped envelope from the Lawn Institute, P.O. Box 108, Pleasant Hill, TN 38578 . . . . The Alternative, 3439 E. 86th St., Suite 259D, Indianapolis, IN 46240, offers a free garden tool catalog.</p><p><em>Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their food on a small farm and publish</em> HortIdeas, <em>a fine newsletter on gardening research and products ($10 a year from G. & P. Williams, Rt. 1, Box 302, Gravel Switch, KY 40328).</em></p>
