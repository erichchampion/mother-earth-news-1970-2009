                    <p>      <strong>Take the sting out of winter by stoking up the      stock pot with recipes excerpted from MOTHER's new      companion magazine, American Country.</strong>  </p>			<h5 id="byline"> By Alfred      Meyer</h5>       <p>      He told the story at a party and may have been pulling      everyone's leg. Still, it caused a stir-partly because it      revealed something of the magic of soup making and partly      because it sounded like a fairy tale. An anthropologist, he      had done fieldwork in a small rural village in northern      China before the Communist revolution. As far as he could      determine from local records and lore, he said, the fire      beneath the large, black, communal iron cooking pot in the      village center had been kept going for at least 400 years.      Each day-as they had evidently done for more than 15      generations-the villagers would toss in fresh greens,      herbs, spices, rice, knucklebones, chicken feet, bird      nests, what have you. And each day the soup changed. He had      nourished himself, he said, over an entire cold and bleak      winter from that ancient pot. "Moreover," he added with a      wink, "the special qualities of the soup undoubtedly      account for the fact that I am now 120 years old."    </p>    <p>      Although there is plenty of magic in soup, and a good bowl      of it can convince you that you will live forever, there is      controversy over how long a decent one should be kept      going. The truth is that after repeated beatings the      vegetable fibers break down and become mushy, while herbs      and spices lose the pungency that brought them to the pot      in the first place. What had been a symphony of distinct      flavors turns into homogenized noise. The French, who      worship soup, would never allow one to go downhill, knowing      full well that the key to a distinguished serving lies in      utterly fresh ingredients: greens, herbs, and, in      Marseilles, fish. The Chinese know this as      well-despite the anthropologist's story-having      raised the art of soup making to positively Zen heights.    </p>    <p>      Even in America, before the advent of canning and      dehydration, self-respecting country cooks continually      urged their pupils (usually their daughters) to make the      time between garden and pot as short as possible.    </p>    <p>      And yet, soup is obviously more than liquid salad. Rather,      it is the wedding of the momentary and the established, the      fresh ingredients and the long-simmered broth. This stock,      the substance that can be nurtured and tended for days and      even weeks, is the magic. The stock of a good soup is like      a good house-commodious, mature, accepting, and      complementary to what goes in it.    </p>    <p>      Inevitably, the education of a soup maker begins with      stock. Marjorie M. Watkins knows this well: She learned her      soup making from her great-grandmother who began married      life and bore her first six of twelve children in a sod      house on the Kansas plains. Marjorie's beef stock recipe,      which has provided the groundwork for innumerable delicious      meals, has stood the test of time.    </p>    <h3>Beef Stock</h3>    <p>      3 pounds stewing meat with bones, cut up<br />      1 pound marrow or soup bones<br />      3 quarts cold water<br />      1 cup dry red table wine<br />      1 large onion, quartered<br />      2 carrots, chopped<br />      2 celery stalks and tops, chopped<br />      2 tomatoes, quartered<br />      2 garlic cloves, minced<br />      1 thyme sprig<br />      5 parsley sprigs<br />      1 bay leaf<br />      5 peppercorns<br />      1 tablespoon salt    </p>    <p>      Brown the meat in a lightly oiled skillet, then place it in      a kettle with the water. Pour the wine into the skillet and      use it to scrape up the browned meat juices, then add this      mix to the kettle. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer      partly covered for 2 hours, occasionally skimming froth      from the stock's surface. Then add remaining ingredients,      and simmer for 2 hours more. Remove meat and bones,      reserving meat for some other use. Strain stock through a      coarse vegetable sieve, then through a double layer of      cheesecloth. Cool stock to room temperature before      refrigerating or freezing.    </p>   <p><strong>The education of a soup maker inevitably begins      with stocks.</strong></p>        <p>      Do not defat stock if storing, for the fat will rise and      congeal on the surface, acting as a sealant. Prior to use,      it can easily be removed. (Since freezing separates      ingredients, thawed stock should be briefly reboiled.)    </p>    <p>      If fresh stock is to be used immediately, however, spoon      off as much fat as possible from the surface. Floating an      ice cube in the stock will congeal the rest, or you can      sweep the surface with a chilled lettuce leaf. To clarify      either fresh or stored stock, add to each quart an egg      white slightly beaten in 2 teaspoons water, and 1 crushed      eggshell. Stir, heat, and boil for 2 minutes, then let      stand unstirred for 20 minutes. Strain through a double      layer of cheesecloth. Now you're ready to make some serious      soup, perhaps this winter staple from the heartland:    </p>    <h3>Iowa Vegetable Soup</h3>    <p>      When Sylvia and Bob Chenault of Walcot, Iowa, sent MOTHER      this recipe, it was December 2 and the temperature on their      farm hovered right around the five degree mark. Simple to      prepare, the Chenaults' warming recipe relies heavily on      produce from the family's garden.    </p>    <p>      4 quarts beef stock<br />      1 1/2 pounds soup meat<br />      1/2 cup sliced onions<br />      1 cup diced green pepper<br />      1 cup diced kohlrabi<br />      2 cups sliced carrots<br />      1 cup snow peas (or shelled peas)<br />      1 cup long-grain brown rice<br />      1 quart home-canned tomatoes<br />      1 pint tomato sauce<br />      Salt and garlic powder to taste    </p>    <p>      Warm beef stock, add meat, and let simmer about 1/2 hour.      Add other ingredients, and simmer 1 hour or until      vegetables are tender. Makes 5 quarts, appetites robust,      and cheeks rosy.    </p>  <h3>Chicken Stock</h3>    <p>      5 pounds chicken, cut up, with giblets<br />      (less the liver)<br />      3 quarts cold water<br />      2 onions, quartered<br />      2 carrots, chopped<br />      2 leeks and tops, chopped<br />      5 parsley sprigs<br />      2 thyme sprigs<br />      1 bay leaf<br />      4 peppercorns<br />      1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning<br />      1 tablespoon salt    </p>    <p>      Add chicken and giblets to water and slowly bring to rapid      boil. Simmer for 1 hour, periodically skimming off the      froth. Add remaining ingredients, except salt, cover, and      simmer for 1 more hour. Remove meat from bones but return      them to kettle, then add salt, and simmer 45 minutes.      Strain through fine sieve, and cool to room temperature.      Refrigerate or freeze in covered container or use at once.    </p>    <p>      Hundreds of recipes call for this versatile base, but here      is one that is utterly simple and appropriately seasonal:    </p>    <h3>Chestnut Soup</h3>    <p>      1 cup chestnuts<br />      2 quarts chicken stock<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1/2 teaspoon pepper    </p>    <p>      Shell and blanch the chestnuts. Place 2 cups of the chicken      stock in a large pot, and cook the chestnuts in it until      they are tender. Remove the chestnuts with a slotted spoon,      salt them lightly, and set them aside. Add the remainder of      the stock to the hot stock in the pot, and bring to a boil.      Put the chestnuts in a soup tureen, pour the stock over      them, and serve at once.    </p>    <h3>Fish Stock</h3>    <p>      2 pounds fish heads, bones, skin, tails, but no gills<br />      2 small onions, diced<br />      2 stalks celery with tops, chopped<br />      2 1/2 cups cold water<br />      2 cups dry white wine<br />      3 parsley sprigs<br />      1 bay leaf<br />      1 thyme sprig<br />      1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds<br />      5 peppercorns<br />      Salt to taste    </p>    <p>      Combine everything but salt in kettle, bring to boil, and      simmer covered for 45 minutes, now and then skimming off      froth. Add salt at the last moment. Strain, cool at room      temperature, and then refrigerate in closed container. The      stock can be stored and frozen, although, as with just      about every thing, fresh is best. The following gumbo is a      favorite in New Orleans:    </p>    <h3>Shrimp Gumbo</h3>    <p>      2 shallots, diced<br />      1/2 green pepper, diced<br />      1 teaspoon olive oil<br />      2 cups okra, sliced<br />      2 stalks celery with tops, sliced<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      3 cups water<br />      1 pound small, peeled, deveined shrimp<br />      2 1/2 cups fish stock<br />      1 cup long-grain rice, cooked<br />      Salt and pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      Sauté shallots and peppers in olive oil. Add okra,      celery, salt, and water, and bring to boil. Cover and      simmer at low heat for 10 minutes. Add shrimp and stock,      and simmer 5 minutes more, no longer; shrimp are delicate.      Add rice, stir, and season with salt and pepper.    </p>
