        <p><strong>NATURAL KITCHEN</strong></p><p><strong>MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong></p><h5 id="byline">By Anne Vassal</h5><p><strong>Bring in the New Year with a low-fat, high-class dinner.</strong></p><p>To me, diet has always been synonymous with self-discipline (as well as starving and suffering). I'm glad to see that more and more people are coming to grips with the fact that diets simply don't work. The idea from years past of "eating like a bird" actually slowed down our metabolism by making our body think it was starving (which of course it was) - and everyone despises deprivation.</p><p>So this year, make a nutritional New Year's resolution that you can actually live with. Make the switch to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate life-style. I won't preach about consistent exercise, except to say it's the best way to increase our metabolism, burn body fat, release stress, and give us more energy. I have come to love my time on the bicycle, which gives me a chance to escape family members who want to know if they have any clean socks or where the milk is.</p><p>Now, let's talk low-fat eating. The U.S. government guidelines recommend that no more than 30% of our daily consumed calories come from fat. As illustrated in the USDA food pyramid (which replaces the obsolete four food groups), fats and sweets are the no-no's at the tip of the pyramid while carbohydrates make up its foundation. This is where our government finally got smart; complex carbohydrate calories are rarely stored as fat because they're the body's main source of energy.</p><p>The fat you eat is converted into body fat more efficiently than the carbohydrates and protein (unfair but true). Fat has the highest calorie density of all foods - nine calories per gram of fat. This compares with four calories per gram for both carbohydrates and protein. A single tablespoon of oil contains 120 calories - all of them fat calories. We could eat the same number of calories by eating three-fourths cup of oatmeal, six cups of air-popped popcorn, or four cups of green beans.</p><p>Does this mean that if we normally consume 2,000 calories per day but want to shed a few pounds, we can still eat the same number of calories and lose weight? Yes, but all those nasty, old fat calories must be replaced with complex carbohydrates, protein, plus fruits and vegetables. This creates a bit of a challenge because most people are used to "enhancing flavors" by throwing butter, sauce, and plenty of disguised fats on top of their meals. Here are some suggestions to ease into a healthier 1994.</p><p><em><strong>Low-Fat Tips</strong></em></p><p>Use vinegar, mustard, tamari, lemon juice, garlic, chilies, fresh ginger, spices, and herbs to flavor foods.<br />Use wine, tomato sauce, and unsalted chicken broth to replace the oil in sauces. Chicken broth has 1.4 grams of fat per cup, compared to 13.5 grams for one tablespoon of olive oil.<br />Broil, grill, or roast meats, fish, vegetables, and tofu instead of frying. Poach (steam) chicken and fish in wine and garlic.<br />Make vegetables, pasta, and grains the focus of the meal. Use meat sparingly.<br />Cook with nonstick pans. If oil is needed, brush on a little.<br />Use a spray bottle for cooking oil instead of buying cooking spray. A water filled spray bottle is also handy when sautéed food sticks to the pan.<br />Use dairy products sparingly. Use lowfat cheeses, sour cream, cottage cheese, and yogurt. In recipes using sour cream or mayonnaise, replace half of the mayonnaise with low-fat yogurt.<br />Substitute evaporated skim milk for cream. In baked goods, replace the milk with low-fat buttermilk, soy milk, or rice cream.<br />Try jam and yogurt cheese on toast, muffins, and bagels instead of butter.<br />Grate cheese onto the food instead of slicing it; you'll use less.<br />Serve seasonal fruit for dessert. Poach some pears, sauté apples in maple syrup, and serve with frozen yogurt.<br />Prepare raw vegetables, baked chips, and salsa to have ready for snacking.<br />Read labels. Some low-fat packaged foods are not low-fat at all. Health Valley has a good selection of quality fat-free products.</p><p><strong>NEW YEAR'S DAY TIP</strong><strong>:</strong><br /><strong>Have trouble avoiding snacks at parties? Fill up on a frui</strong><strong>t shake before you go.</strong></p><h3>New Year's Eve Appetizer:Red Bean Dip</h3><p>I use canned beans to save time, but if you have some leftover cooked beans, this is a good time to use them up.</p><p><em>1 can red beans (15 ounces), rinsed well and drained</em><br /><em>a few drops of oil</em><br /><em>1 large clove garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped<br />1/2 teaspoon hot pepper (jalapeño), stem removed (use more if desired)<br />1 small onion, peeled and coarsely chopped</em><br /><em>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br />1/2 teaspoon chili powder<br />dash salt<br />2 tablespoons lime juice<br />1 tablespoon water<br />1 tablespoon nonfat yogurt<br />1 tablespoon light sour cream</em></p><p>Garnishes (optional):</p><p><em>chopped green onions cilantro<br />chopped fresh tomatoes<br />chopped canned chilies</em></p><p>In a nonstick skillet sauté garlic, pepper, and onion in oil until they're wilted. Pour into a food processor or blender. Add rest of ingredients except yogurt and sour cream; blend well. Remove from blender and stir in yogurt and sour cream. Add additional water if dip is too thick. Refrigerate in a covered container. Serve topped with any of the above garnishes.</p><p><strong>For Dipping:</strong></p><p>We all know cut up vegetables make the perfect dippers. Did you know that stale bread is another good choice?</p><p><em>corn tortillas, cut like a pie into eighths<br />whole wheat pita bread, split apart into individual circles, then cut into wedges<br />bagels, quartered and sliced very thin<br />French or Italian bread, sliced very thin and then into desired sizes</em></p><p>Preheat oven to 325° F. Arrange bread(s) of your choice on a large cookie sheet. Spray bread with water using a spray bottle. Bake for at least 20 minutes or until bread is crispy (thicker bread takes longer). Halfway through crisping, turn bread over if necessary. Cool thoroughly before storing in an airtight container.</p><p><strong>For Topping:</strong></p><p>After spraying bread with water, sprinkle with seasonings or dried herbs. Try:</p><p><em>Cajun seasoning (low sodium), chili powder, paprika (low sodium),<br />Veg-salt or Spike, dried herbs: basil, oregano, or thyme.</em></p><p><strong>Main Coarse: Roasted Vegetables With Linguini</strong></p><p><em>1 teaspoon olive oil<br />1 medium onion, halved and sliced thinly into 1/2" circles<br />2 medium zucchini or yellow squash (two cups), halved and cut into 1/4"slices<br />1 small eggplant (about three cups), cut into 1/2" cubes<br />1 medium red pepper, cut into thin strips<br />3 large cloves garlic, minced<br />1/2 teaspoon hot pepper (jalapeño) or cayenne<br />2 teaspoons dried basil<br />1 teaspoon oregano<br />4 tomatoes (canned plum without the puree), chopped<br />1/2 cup tomato puree<br />1/3 to 1/2 cup chicken broth (unsalted)<br />1 teaspoon balsamic or red wine vinegar<br />1/2 teaspoon sugar<br />salt and freshly ground pepper<br />freshly grated Romano cheese</em></p><p>Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large bowl toss together oil, vegetables, garlic, hot pepper, and herbs. Pour onto a foil-lined cookie sheet. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until vegetables are browned but not soggy. Meanwhile, heat tomatoes, puree, broth, vinegar, and sugar. Stir in roasted vegetables. Add salt and pepper according to taste. Prepare linguini and drain. Toss linguini in large bowl with vegetables. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons grated cheese on top of each serving. (If desired, top with fresh, chopped herbs, such as basil, oregano, and parsley.)</p><p><strong>Dessert: Mint Brownies</strong></p><p>These low-fat brownies can be eaten plain or topped with frozen yogurt and frozen raspberries or strawberries. These brownies freeze well, so don't be tempted to eat the entire batch.</p><p><em>1 egg<br />1/3 cup applesauce<br />2 tablespoons nonfat yogurt<br />2 tablespoons oil (I use canola)<br />1 tablespoon honey<br />1/4 cup sugar<br />1 teaspoon peppermint extract<br />1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br />1 cup sifted whole wheat pastry flour<br />1/2 teaspoon baking powder (3/4 teaspoon if you like lighter, more cake-like brownies)</em></p><p>Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix well all wet ingredients. Mix in cocoa. Briefly mix in flour and baking powder. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until just done (an inserted toothpick comes out clean). Don't overbake or they won't be moist.</p><p><strong>Morning After: Frozen Fruit Shake</strong></p><p>Start New Year's Day with this easy to make breakfast shake. I usually add a tablespoon of low-fat protein powder to mine because I like to exercise in the morning. You could also add some brewer's yeast or wheat germ for a quick energy boost.</p><p><em>1 cup nonfat yogurt<br />1 cup frozen fruit, such as strawberries, peaches, raspberries<br />1/2 cup fruit juice: apple cider, papaya, mango, pineapple<br />1 tablespoon protein powder (optional)</em></p><p>Let frozen fruit thaw for about 10 minutes. Break up fruit and put in blender. Add rest of ingredients and blend until smooth.</p>
