                    <h3>B. TOUCHSTONE HARDAWAY</h3><p>      My husband, Theo-bless his practical      heart-looked at me with his mouth wide open, trying      for the umpteenth time in our years of marriage to      understand the workings of my mind. Finally, he found his      voice. "Billie, surely you aren't serious about wanting a      wood cookstove. Have you any idea of what using one is      like?" He shook his head.    </p>    <p>      "Yes, I think I do. In fact, I'm sure of it." Boy, that      last crack closed off every avenue of escape. If I weren't      sure, I'd better get that way.    </p>    <p>      Theo went on. "Why, you'll probably break your foot the      first day kicking the blamed thing when it doesn't do to      suit you." He threw back his head and laughed. Theo had      grown up with a wood-burning cookstove and claimed to know      all their quirks.    </p>    <p>      His arguments were sound enough but I had a few of my own:      "I know a wood-burning range would be sheer purgatory for      many, but I think it will be therapeutic for my impatient      nature. Also, think of the money we'll save on the electric      bill and it's a great way to get rid of all that scrub      timber growing everywhere . . . and, besides, I WANT IT."    </p>    <p>      A smile played at the corners of Theo's mouth. How well he      knew me. "Alright. We'll buy you a woodburning cookstove      but, once it's bought, there'll be no turning back. Okay?"    </p>    <p>      Okay! I swallowed hard because I knew I had some research      work cut out for me before my stove arrived.    </p>    <h3>THE OLD WAYS WERE OFTEN GOOD WAYS</h3><p>I      guess you could say I'm semi-old-fashioned. 1 like sturdy      iron bedsteads, big-legged tables, well-sunned mattresses,      skirts to the knees, a fresh-scrubbed look and cakes made      from the flour up. I enjoy watching hens scratching in the      yard for their biddies and-occasionally-I like      to scrub my floors with a bucket of lye water and a      worn-out broom.    </p>    <p>      The latter could be a carryover from childhood, since I      always associate lye-scrubbed floors and sunned mattresses      with my growing-up period. The finishing touch on spring      cleaning days was to place a large, fragrant bouquet of      wild Sweet Williams in the center of an oil cloth-covered      table. I can smell them now!    </p>    <p>      Because I am fond of so many things and traditions of      yesterday, the idea of a wood-burning cookstove had sort of      eased into my mind over the years even though I knew      absolutely nothing about using one . . .      and-suddenly-my stove was here!    </p>    <p>      Theo put the cookstove up with its long, glossy black pipe      leading into the new brick chimney. Our little issues ran      about gathering kindling and bits of wood for the first      blaze in mama's new stove that was just like the one Martha      Washington had used to cook meals for George.    </p>    <p>      Theo built a fire and I transferred supper from the      electric range to the wood burner. Then, as the new stove      got hot, smoke began seeping out of every nook and cranny      and rose in sheets off its top. The thick haze filled the      kitchen and quickly forced us-coughing and      sputtering-to open every available window and door      (in January, yet). The condition was temporary, however,      and only lasted a few minutes until the "new" wore off. We      soon had the house buttoned up again and I eagerly looked      forward to fathoming the mysteries of the wood-burning      cookstove.    </p>    <h3>STARTING THE FIRE</h3><p>Since I grew up      without the privilege of brothers and the knowledge      bestowed on very young ladies by that fine organization      known as The Girl Scouts, I knew absolutely zero about      starting a fire. I had halfheartedly watched my husband and      sons build a blaze in our fireplace . . . but never with      the interest needed to really learn how and the first time      I faced the ordeal of firing up my new stove unassisted, I      nearly panicked.    </p>    <p>      On that wretched day I burned three Sunday editions of the      paper and a whole log of rich pine and-an hour      later-all I had to show was a lot of filmy ashes      floating about, a streak of soot across my face and a stove      that was still as cold as a wedge (in this case, a wedge of      ice).    </p>    <p>      It was thus that Theo found me when he came home weary from      the field for his supper. In my romantic imagination, I had      planned to quote from Oliver Goldsmith's <em>The      Traveller,</em> this beautiful little verse:    </p>    <p>      At night returning, every labour sped<br />      He sits him down the monarch of a shed<br />      Smiles by his cheerful fire, and round surveys<br />      His children's looks, that brighten at the blaze;<br />      While his lov'd partner, boastful of her hoard,<br />      Displays her cleanly platter on the board.<br />    </p>    <p>      Well, the only part that now applied was the cleanly      platter. It was clean indeed and there was no fire,      cheerful or otherwise. I suppose the one thing which saved      his lov'd partner from rebuke was the wretched look on her      soot-streaked face. Theo's only comment, in a very sober      voice, was: "Is there any kindling left?"    </p>    <p>      With those not-kind-but-not-scolding words, I fled to the      wood shed and scraped up a few chips. In no time at all,      Theo had a cheerful fire spittin' and poppin'. It just made      me sick.    </p>    <p>      After what seemed an eternity, I finally got the hang of      it. Now, I only need a tiny bit of kindling or dry blocks      and a sheet of newspaper to start a roaring blaze. Here's      how I do it:    </p>    <p>      It's all-important that you don't let your stove's ash      container get too full. This is because the ash box is      usually so close to the fire box that, full, it can cut off      the oxygen needed to make a fire "draw". I empty the ashes      from my stove about twice a week. Since hot ashes always      contain sparks that can ignite in the slightest wind, this      job should be done in the morning, before a fire is built.    </p>    <p>      Next, I open the damper all the way so the air will draw      and I lay my fire by taking one single sheet of newspaper      (dry leaves, pine needles or tar paper will do if no      newspaper is available), wadding it loosely and placing the      wad in the front of the firebox. On top of this I      crisscross some splinters. Then, on top of' it all I place      a few sticks of dry wood and "light her up". In no time at      all she's ready for the coffee pot and kettle.    </p>    <p>      The damper, by the way, regulates the blaze (and,      therefore, the heat) by controlling the flow of air      (oxygen) through the fire box. You want the damper wide      open when starting afire. Once it's burning nicely close      the damper a bit to hold the heat in the stove or to slow      down the blaze.    </p>        <p>      One afternoon, I was busy and called to my teenage      daughter, Bonnie, to turn the chicken for me. She yelled,      "How you turn this darn thing off?" We had a good laugh      (one of many) before I introduced her to the indispensable      damper. I explained there was no ON or OFF <em>per se,</em>      only an UP and DOWN, which is controlled with the damper.      When you need OFF, you simply remove the pot; when you want      to hold the heat DOWN, you turn the damper or push the pot      to the side of the stove away from the heat. Simple! Bonnie      grinned and shook her pretty head.    </p>    <p>      I never use kerosene or gasoline as a quick starter. They      are highly dangerous and they really don't help. If the      wood is dry enough to burn at all, it will start with a      little encouragement from newspaper, pin: needles or dry      leaves. If it's not dry enough, kerosene or gas won't help.      Once the fluid burns itself out you're right back where you      started. I do keep a little hatchet handy, though, to      tailor-made splinters when they're brought in too big.    </p>    <h3>FUELS AND FUELING</h3>    <p>      To each his own about flee kind of wood to burn in a      cookstove. You'll probably want to experiment until you      find your favorite In my opinion, ash makes the hottest      fire and hickory is best for steady heat. Now that we live      most of the year where cedar is plentiful, I cook quite a      lot with it and enjoy the added benefit of a nice aroma.    </p>    <p>      If you live where you can't afford to be choicey, don't      fret: Any wood will give a good, substantial fire once you      get it going. And, if you have no wood at all, most of the      old-time cookstoves will cheerfully accept hard coal, soft      coal, coke or even corncobs.    </p>    <p>      While we're on the subject of wood, I should      mention-for those who don't know (and I was among      them until two years ago)-the difference between      <em>green</em> and <em>dry</em> wood. Well do I remember      the first time I sent our youngest daughter out to bring me      a turn of green wood. She came back empty-handed and said      sadly, "There is no green wood . . . only brown and sort of      blackish."    </p>    <p>      <em>Green</em> wood is wood that hasn't been cut too long.      It's full of moisture and quite heavy. <em>Dry</em> wood      has been cut long enough to dry out. It's quite light and      burns rapidly.    </p>    <p>      A good formula to follow is: For quick heat, use <em>tinder      dry;</em> for standard baking, use <em>year old wood</em>      (dry); and for a slow, steady, long-holding fire, use      <em>nearly green</em> wood.    </p>    <p>      Green wood is usually added after the fire is really going      good. You'll soon learn to mix green and dry wood too. This      gives a "just right" fire for most any kind of cooking      except deep fat frying which takes a blaze "hot as hell".      For this, you need all dry wood and the damper tightly      closed.    </p>    <p>      One of the most difficult things I had to learn-or      rather, not forget-was to keep the fire box full of      wood while cooking a meal. I would be cooking away      and-suddenly-my french fries were just "sitting      there" before I realized that I hadn't fed the fire      recently. This, of course, is a must so you have to make      like a railroad man and keep "firing that ole boiler".    </p>    <p>      I get up in the mornings an hour before I am ready to cook.      This gives the fire a chance to "do its thing" and gives me      some quiet time before our little ones are rip and about.      When the fire is ready, I have everything prepared to cook.    </p>    <h3>WOOD SUPPLY</h3>    <p>      If one lives on a tiny place or has no scrub timber to use      for firewood, there are solutions. Almost any farmer or      landowner will allow you to cut scrub timber from his      place, clearing the way for more pasture and tillable land.      The only requisite is that you pile the brush neatly or      take it with you. This, too, can be used for firewood if      broken or chopped and piled.    </p>    <p>      If you live in the vicinity of a sawmill or lumber yard of      some sort, there are always. discarded strips and shavings      that will burn. In Louisiana, when we don't want to go      "pine knot huntin"' we visit a nearby box factory where      scrap lumber has been piled many feet high. This scrap      burns great.    </p>    <p>      As I walk in the woods of Louisiana and the Ozarks I see      what amounts to literally truck loads of rotten, dry limbs      and felled trees. In Europe, this would be a goldmine since      many a serious livelihood is earned by gathering such wood      and peddling it to townspeople for fuel.    </p>    <p>      There's no need to invest in a noisy chain saw for your      wood-hunting expeditions. If you want something more      traditional, less expensive and quieter, try a crosscut.      You know . . . the long, two-man saw that you pull back and      forth until the tree is felled. I've been on one end of      such a saw and it's a splendid body conditioner. If you      can't afford a saw you might do as Thoreau did: Borrow one.      Just be sure you return it sharper than you found it . . .      again, as Thoreau did.    </p>    <h3>CLEANING THE STOVE</h3>    <p>      The cleaning of a wood-burning stove involves very little      effort. If you spill grease or food on it, the spill      <em>burns</em> right off. I keep a bundle of newspapers      handy and after each meal, I wipe my cookstove vigorously      with a wadded sheet. Then, once every two weeks or so, I      "black" the stove.    </p>    <p>      Blacking consists of dipping a limber paint brush      (39 cents) into the stove polish or blacking (49 cents a      bottle and enough for three applications) and painting it      on. The process gives a newness to the stove and makes it      look pretty . . . also keeps it from rusting, I understand.    </p>    <p>      I then wipe the white part of the cookstove until it's      shiny clean with my dish towel. Now and then I also wipe      out the oven with a damp towel and scrape away any spills.    </p>    <p>      Once or twice a year I take all the burners off the top and      clean out the soot and ashes that have blown between the      oven and the burners. This collection doesn't interfere      with the stove's performance but cleaning it out makes me      feel as good as when I move the refrigerator to sweep and      mop away a year's collection of dust.    </p>    <p>      I am no slave to housework, so I really enjoy the easy care      of my wood-burning range.    </p>    <h3>SECOND THOUGHTS</h3>    <p>      One of my glutton-for-gloom friends said I'd change my mind      about the cookstove after one good, hot summer. I gave this      a lot of thought before we bought the range and frequently      considered how our grandmothers-attired in their      several long skirts, with cheeks ablazin' and hearts      asingin'-worked diligently in all kinds of weather      and prepared menus fit for any old king on an iron stove. I      couldn't believe summer cooking would be such an ordeal.    </p>    <p>      And it isn't. At this writing I've just finished the second      hot summer with my wood stove and I wouldn't go "back" to      the modern method under any circumstances.    </p>    <p>      Although the question of summer cooking hadn't bothered me,      I did have one concern about the stove: I didn't want it to      be a traumatic experience for Bonnie since-even      before the cookstove arrived-it had seemed to highly      embarrass her. She had, in fact, detested even the thought      of the range and hoped to the last minute I'd "come to my      senses" and not bring that monstrosity into our pretty,      sunny kitchen.    </p>    <p>      I think somewhere in her young, sensitive mind, she      associated the wood-burning stove with deprivation . . . or      maybe she didn't know how she would explain my actions to      her peers.    </p>    <p>      Then, as if by a miracle, the boy she was dating came early      one evening and watched as I fried chicken (we eat a lot of      chicken). We chatted while he waited for Bonnie      and-although he said not a word about the      stove-he sure eyeballed it.    </p>    <p>      Later, Bonnie told me the boy had asked her if that was a      wood cookstove her mother was using and when she sadly      confessed that it was, he beamed. "Really? Gee, I hope      you'll ask me to eat sometimes. The food's great cooked on      one. My granny had a wood stove until last year."    </p>    <p>      Bonnie said the young fellow even mentioned that he thought      her mother was "cool". I <em>like</em> that boy.    </p>    <h3>A BIGGER STOVE . . . AND A BETTER      LIFE</h3>    <p>      Henry Thoreau, God rest his soul, knew his stuff when he      said, "Simplify, simplify". This-for at least nine      months of each year-we have literally done. We now      have two homes: One in the thick of the "rat race" in      Louisiana where everyone's in a mad dash, racial tension is      thick and trust for each other is a thing long gone. The      other, a little four room "unmodern" house we rent for      twenty bucks a month, is in the heart of the beautiful      Ozark Mountains.    </p>    <p>      Here, in our second domicile, I wash our clothes on a      rubboard outside next to nature; I carry our wood and water      inside; we have no telephone, television nor neighbors for      a mile in any direction. Daily, we walk a mile up the      mountain and a mile back for our mail. The local people are      slow to anger, slow to criticize and quick to help. The      school at the foot of the mountains is unsophisticated and      undemanding in every way.    </p>    <p>      We live in our retreat house nine months of the year. Then      we're forced back to that "other way" to earn enough to      live our simple and quiet life here in the hills.    </p>    <p>      We have only the barest furniture necessities and every      item in our mountain house is "useful". To quote Thoreau      again, "Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called      comforts of life are . . . positive hindrances." Amen!    </p>    <p>      We considered ourselves lucky as all get out when we found      a beautifully cared for Home Comfort woodburning cookstove      for our retreat. It is truly an antique, but sturdy as the      mountains surrounding our house. The white on the stove      still gleams except where pots have been scraped back and      forth over the years.    </p>    <p>      I wouldn't take ten times the price we paid for the range      nor 50 times that much for the friendship we made with its      sellers, two lovely little ladies in their seventies who      care tenderly for each other. They used the stove for 50      years before selling it.    </p>    <p>      This range is much bigger than the one I have in Louisiana      and I could cook for a battalion of men on it. The food      warmers on top are large enough to hold a full meal with      the doors closed. The giant oven will cook six loaves of      bread at once and the copper-lined water reservoir heats      fifteen gallons so hot I have to cool it to do dishes.    </p>    <p>      Each time I stand cooking at this stove I think of all the      fine old women who must have stood just as I, meditating as      they stirred a bubbley pot. The date of manufacture is      1864, so probably a hoop skirt has been worn here too.    </p>    <p>      During the course of a meal's preparation, I bend and stoop      and squat many times to fill the fire box or punch around      to liven the coals. Needless to say, this is good for my      matronly waistline.    </p>    <p>      Then, of course, there is that special treat of going to      the wood shed, or <em>wood pile</em> here in the Ozarks. It      gives me a chance to listen to the songs of a variety of      birds and enjoy nature a bit while I load my arms with the      aromatic cedar wood. It seems only natural for me at this      time to thank my Creator for allowing me to be cast in the      lot that I am.    </p>    <p>      Ah, the wood chopping . . . the inevitable wood chopping.      When my strong-armed husband cuts the wood, he hauls it to      the house in blocks to be split later. He and the boys do      this chore for the most part but, sometimes, I enjoy taking      a whack with the axe.    </p>    <p>      Most of the time I miss the block completely and stab the      ground. When I am able to hit the block, the axe mostly      bounces off the silly thing (and my sons double over with      laughter). Once in a while I am able to strike a cruel blow      and split a block. Then, of course, I am filled with      incentive and wear myself down trying for a repeat      performance. By the time I have a pitiful little pile of      wood, I am hot as a pistol. One ole timer put it well: "My      wood warms me while I'm cuttin' it and again when I burn      it."    </p>    <p>      Though my accomplishments are not great on my wood choppin'      days, I can eat like a horse and not worry about calories.      In fact, I haven't thought much on dieting since being here      in the mountains. There's no need. We work hard, we eat      wholesome foods, we sleep nearly ten hours a night and the      calories take care of themselves.    </p>    <p>      We are in bed before nine each evening unless we feel      reckless, and then we stay up another thirty minutes to      read a few more chapters. Six o'clock in the morning finds      me searching for the light string in my little kitchen and      preparing to lay my fire.    </p>    <h3>THE STOVEPIPE OVEN</h3>    <p>      While looking for a wood range to buy, my Husband and I      were browsing in a local hardware store here in the Ozarks      and found a quaint little <em>stovepipe oven.</em> The      first I had ever seen, but the salesman said they'd been      around for as long as he could remember. He said they fit      between the first and second joint of the stovepipe on a      heater or range and the heat scurrying up the pipe gets the      little oven hot enough to bake anything you like. It's      plenty big for a loaf of bread, cakes or a hen, yet. Just      perfect for the small family.    </p>    <p>      If a family didn't want to invest in a wood-burning range      but found it necessary to buy a wood-burning heater for      warmth, they could purchase one of these ducky little ovens      and insert it in the stovepipe of their heater. They'd then      be all set for cooking, heating and baking. The little      ovens cost in the neighborhood of nine dollars. They are      substantially built and, in my opinion, are well worth the      price.    </p>    <p>      I wouldn't mind at all cooking on such an ensemble and I      plan to buy one of these ovens and mount it on our heater's      pipe. Then-if I should take the notion to bake a cake      and the range isn't fired up-I can still bake. Sort      of like killing two birds with one stove!    </p>    <h3>IN CONCLUSION</h3>    <p>      I can now look back two years and laugh at my anxieties      about starting a fire in my wood-burning range. In fact, I      find that-as I put more years behind me-I am      able to laugh at most things I once thought were major      catastrophies. And I did have my problems with that stove.    </p>    <p>      The first time I baked biscuits I burned them to ebony.      Also the second and third time. But on the fourth try they      came out golden brown. And I burned my hands and wrists      every day until I finally got it through my blockhead that      EVERYTHING on or near that stove was HOT! But      surely-if somewhat slowly-I mastered the wood      range.    </p>    <p>      There's one thing about my cookstoves-No, there are      many things about them, but this one in      particular-they simply won't be hurried. They take      their own sweet time. No begging, wringing the hands or      kicking their backsides will get them hot any faster. They      force me to slow my quick-moving self to a snail's pace,      which is good for me.    </p>    <p>      I am compelled to wait for the fire to get hot enough      before I put the bacon in the skillet, or else it will just      boil gently ( <em>gag</em> ). Then I'm compelled to wait      for the fire to cool down enough to pop the biscuits into      the rosey-red oven or I have      burned-on-the-outside-and-gooey-on-the-inside      <em>(shudder)</em> biscuits. I like to think of these      "waits" as character-building.    </p>    <p>      I should explain here that, for me, there's a vast      difference in doing a thing that can be aggravating at      times, "by choice" rather than "by necessity". When I feel      forced to accept a situation that irritates me, I can moan      and complain louder than any soul for miles around. But      when the thing or situation is my own choice, I feel pretty      silly griping about it . . . in fact. I'd better not, if I      know what's good for me.    </p>    <p>      To be even more honest, there are times when cooking on a      wood-burning range can be pure hair shirt, UNLESS I channel      my attitude into the right groove. Honestly though, these      times are rare.    </p>    <p>      Once I learned to operate my wood stove I began to really      enjoy its coziness. While I'm writing I can see to dinner      and mind the fire box. It gives me a warm,      everythings-fine-with-the-world feeling to fill the fire      box with "just right" green wood for gently boiling a big      pot of vegetable soup or turnip greens and a good ham bone.    </p>    <p>      Yes, I enjoy my wood-burning stove, but a word of caution      to the would-be owners of one: If you're geared to live in      a mad dash, stewing in your own juice AND you don't wish to      change . . . you'd better not tinker around with a      wood-burning cookstove. Chances are you'll flip your lid as      well as the stove's.    </p>    <p>      But if you're able to slow your pace; you don't mind some      of your friends clucking their tongues or lifting their      eyebrows at your action; if you like a taste of yesterday,      the wonderful smell of wood smoke, apples in your cheeks      AND you have a jim-dandy supply of wood and fat pine      kindlin' . . . you just might get the same pleasure from      your wood stove that I have from mine. I hope so.    </p>
