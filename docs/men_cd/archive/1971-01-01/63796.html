                    <h5 id="byline">      by ALICE OKORN    </h5>        <p>      My husband, two small children and I live on a farm in      Missouri. We raise almost every mouthful of food we eat and      everything in our gardens, berry patches and fields is      organically grown in rich, composted soil. Much of our      produce is sold through our local health food store and      directly to individuals concerned about the quality of the      food they eat.    </p>    <p>      About a year ago we realized my flock of chickens was too      small to supply our demand for eggs so, rather than wait      long months for several incubator hatchings of chicks to      grow to layer size, we decided upon an experiment: We would      buy some run-down, drained hens from an egg farm; take them      off their highly-stimulated commercial mash, rejuvenate      them on our pure, unadulterated feed and make them lay      profitably. Would it work? We decided to try.    </p>    <p>      We went to a nearby chicken farm and bought 50 scraggly      laying hens. They were only about 2 years old, the age at      which many commercial egg producers get rid of their "old"      exhausted, worn-out layers. These birds surely looked it;      they were half naked because their systems couldn't produce      enough feathers while being drained of vitality by the      forced laying. The feathers they did have were messy and      bedraggled, not white and shiny. Their combs were pale and      droopy instead of red and pert like those of my own healthy      chickens. And the huge eggs they laid had very thin shells,      pale yolks and watery whites. Infertile, of course.    </p>    <p>      We took them home.    </p>    <p>      Can you imagine the commotion in my hen house the next      morning when the roosters discovered 50 new hens? Hens that      didn't even know what roosters are for!    </p>    <p>      Since I love animals and wish for their comfort and      contentment, the most pathetic aspect of these miserable      creatures was their long, long toe nails. Why? Because,      having been raised on a slat floor, they had been deprived      of their favorite pastime-scratching. Picture      chickens that always have to walk on a grate-like floor      with toes protruding downward; there is no way for them to      wear their nails down to proper length. And, having been      thus confined, these birds didn't even know the luxury (as      did my tiny 3-day-old chicks) of dusting the few feathers      they had. But, even chickens keep up with their neighbors,      so they soon learned (and loved it!) Of course, it was days      and days before they were brave enough to venture from the      poultry house into the outdoor world.    </p>    <p>      How those birds changed in a few months! Within days they      quit laying altogether while their bodies concentrated on      sprouting new feathers. Soon they were showing off new      plumage and red combs to my own chickens instead of hiding      under the bushes in embarrassment.    </p>    <p>      After many months some of the new birds again began laying      eggs . . . although not as many as before. These eggs had      thick, hard shells, bright orange-yellow yolks and firm      whites. Several of the hens, though, never regained the      gumption to lay. These I call "boarders", or soup hens.    </p>    <p>      Then came the day I decided to butcher several of these      boarders.    </p>    <p>      Now, I am used to butchering healthy chickens; their      insides are always so clean and neat and smooth and nice,      with rarely anything wrong. So I wasn't prepared for what I      found inside these birds. <em>Every last one</em> of them      had odd lumps, hard swellings, growths and tumors      throughout their innards. One poor hen had masses of tiny,      hard, grainy growths-almost half the volume of her      intestines! Others had shrunken breasts, enlarged portions      of intestines, sick livers and grotesquely-formed, enlarged      feather bases in their skin. All this messy abnormality was      truly a sickening sight.    </p>    <p>      And then I had a horrible thought: If two-year-old hens can      be so frighteningly deformed and sickened by their      "scientific" diet and handling, what do doctors and      surgeons find inside humans? Tumors? Cancers? Gall bladders      and livers gone haywire? Hearts worn out?    </p>    <p>      After all, our foods are poisoned, sprayed, chemicalized,      devitalized, pasturized, hydrogenated, overcooked and      french-fried. The peels, germ, bran, vitamins and minerals      are removed and discarded and what is left is artificially      preserved, colored, flavored and textured. On top of which,      we consume mountains of aspirin, sleeping pills,      stimulants, energizers, pep-pills, tranquilizers,      laxatives, antacids, reducing tablets, birth-control pills,      alcohol, soft drinks and cigarettes.    </p>    <p>      I think the birds ate better!    </p>    <p>      Personally, we plan to continue raising all the food we eat      in good, rich, composted soil. Health, strength and      vitality are for the birds, alright. They're also for      people, too!    </p>
