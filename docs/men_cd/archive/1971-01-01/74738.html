        <p id="byline">Not many of the dollars spent by colleges of agriculture and the USDA are used to develop vegetables and fruits of maximum nutrition and flavor. Today's consumer-either from indoctrination or lack of choice-buys produce almost entirely on the basis of size and color. Most developmental work, therefore, is concentrated on improving only the shipping quality, size and appearance of fruits and vegetables. It becomes a vicious circle. The grower pushes the big and bright and the customer, conditioned to accept such as "good", demands ever bigger and brighter. The few who complain about lack of taste and food value are told that only the big and bright will sell.</p><p>The picture is dark, but not entirely black. There <em>are</em> a few examples of limited search for taste and nutrition and they've produced some varieties of garden fare that you should know about before you start dreaming over those seed catalogs this year. The University of New Hampshire, for instance, appears to be in the nutritional vanguard with its Double Rich tomato. This tomato-which has twice the vitamin C content of ordinary varieties-was bred at the university several years ago. Double Rich still doesn't have the charisma of hybrids such as Big Boy, however, and you may have to start yours from seed.</p><p>The University of New Hampshire is also responsible for an Eat-All Squash with high protein, edible seeds and is credited-I believe-with Sweetheart Beets, which are far more flavorful than the old standards.</p><p>Another notable advance is Purdue University's Caro-Red Tomato, which has 10 times the vitamin A content of older varieties. It is a prolific bearer, either staked or not, but the name Caro-Red may prove confusing; the ripe fruit is medium to large and Caro-Red both adds nutrition and takes salads beyond the usual dimension of red and green.</p><p>Double Rich and Caro-Red are generally classified as medium term tomatoes which means that about 75 to 85 days pass from the time the plants are set in your garden until you pick ripe fruit. If you can get sets of either variety, that is. Most likely, you'll have to start both from seed if you want to try them because commercial growers are not missionaries. They limit their investments in labor and capital to known sellers. Growing your own from the seeds of either open-pollinated variety is not difficult, however.</p><p>Separate a few seeds (from a raw, not cooked, tomato!) into a pan or cup. Wash as much pulp from them as possible and spread the seeds on a paper towel or cloth for a day or two to dry. About 6 to 8 weeks before you want to set plants in your garden, drop these seeds onto a mixture of equal parts sand, peat moss and/or vermiculite and cover slightly. Use dirt only if you bake it for an hour at 250Â° F because dirt sometimes contains spores that kill sprouted seeds. Use small flower pots and other containers which will fit on the inside sill of a window that faces south for your sprouting beds. Water moderately and, with average home temperatures, you'll have your supply of tomato plants free.</p><p>Until four or five years ago, serving sweet corn at our house was not only a matter of production, but of timing, too. My wife placed a pan of water on the range burner while I strolled out to the patch of sweet corn. When the water boiled she rang the old farm bell near the rear door and I began to pull and husk ears as fast as possible. Clutching the freshly peeled ears, I then galloped to the kitchen and dropped them into the boiling water. Like all real roasting ear devotees, we believed that flavor and sweetness diminished by the moment and we were determined to salvage the most of both.</p><p>A new variety of sweet corn, Illini-Chief, put an end to my mad dashes several years ago, however. Illini-Chief is several times more expensive than any other hybrid corn . . . and worth it. Twice as sweet when you pick it, the sugar content of this variety doubles again during the following 48 hours.</p><p>Illini-Chief is a mid-term corn and takes about 80 days to mature but, again, it's worth waiting for. In our area, where the first frost of the season arrives between mid-September and mid-October, I make my final planting so late that the last batch is often frosted out. But those years when old Jack F. is late, the last roasting ears taste best of all. Try it and see if you don't agree: Many seed dealers stock this wonderful product of the Illinois Seed Foundation.</p><p>If you wanted a spaghetti dinner and the menu listed a one cup serving of spaghetti R with 155 calories, 32 grams of carbohydrates, 11 mg. of calcium, zero vitamin A, zero vitamin C and a nominal assortment of other nutrients versus a cup of spaghetti S with 95 calories, 23 grams of carbohydrates, 49 mg. of calcium, 12,690 International Units of vitamin A, 14 mg. of vitamin C and assorted nutrients equal to spaghetti R . . . which would you order? These figures are from the 1959 U.S. Department of Agriculture Year Book titled FOOD. Spaghetti R is the real extruded Italian product. Spaghetti S is the fantastic spaghetti squash.</p><p>This squash is easy to grow. Its vines spread moderately and its fruit is comparable to a small watermelon in size. Preparation is easy. Boil or bake the squash whole and cut it into halves or quarters. Scrape seeds from the cavity and scratch at the meat with a kitchen fork. You'll be amazed to find that it shreds into uniform strands of "spaghetti" with a rich butter yellow tint that is most appetizing. Served with your favorite spaghetti sauce or with meat balls, this is an entree beyond compare, hardly distinguishable from the machine-extruded product. Stored in a dry place, spaghetti squash will last through the spring following harvest.</p><p>You can save spaghetti squash seeds from the uncooked fruit. Clean and dry as instructed for the tomato seeds. Plant by making an indentation about the size of a soup bowl with one stroke of a hoe in prepared ground. Drop four to six seeds into the pit, cover, step on it, take one full stride down the row and make another hole. Space the rows three feet apart and you will have hills of plants approximately three feet by three feet.</p><p>There is a school of thought (which seems logical to me) that when you have need for pollination it is better to plant in blocks than in long rows. In this instance, a small planting of spaghetti squash may bear more abundantly if you arrange, say, nine hills in three rows of three.</p><p>Strawberries are one of the all-time favorite garden plants for both people who rent and people who own property. They are sturdy, easily moved, multiply rapidly via runners (which means-with nominal care-a strawberry bed is forever renewed) and, with little added effort, extra plants may be sold to recover the original investment. Strawberries are mouthwatering to eat too . . . sometimes.</p><p>When you dream of strawberries in the middle of winter, every serving from last spring was delicious. But were they? How many times did you look at an attractive dish of berries and-after tasting-wonder how berries so beautiful could be so ordinary? This is not always true nor need be. There are strawberries and strawberries.</p><p>At one of the annual Small Fruits Day exhibitions given by the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center at Wooster, Dr. Hill-who heads the small fruits department-extolled the several commercial advantages of a new large strawberry developed in New Jersey and another berry not yet released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They were compared in size, shipping quality and other attributes with the popular Robinson.</p><p>The new berries have many things going for them but when I asked Dr. Hill how these huge varieties compared in flavor to the Fairfax he paused only a moment and replied that, in his opinion, there was no comparison between the flavor of the Fairfax and that of any other strawberry. The Fairfax is vastly superior. Dr. Hill added that the general public preferred to buy big berries and bright berries. The Fairfax is neither big nor bright . . . only <em>the best tasting.</em> Therefore, if you want the incomparable deliciousness of Fairfax strawberries you'll probably have to plant them yourself.</p><p>Though I have not tasted all varieties of peaches I am firmly convinced that Champion and Belle of Georgia lead the flavor parade. Both are white and the Belle of Georgia is generally classified as semi-free stone while the Champion is a free stone peach. By the way, when you eat a Champion fresh from the tree wear a bathing suit because the honey-sweet juice will squirt and run in all directions.</p><p>If you're in a big hurry for peaches plant dwarf trees. And the rule is: If you have the choice of a $5.00 tree and a 50 cents hole or a 50 cents tree and a $5.00 hole . . . plant the 50 cents tree in the $5.00 hole.<br /><br />Double Rich and Caro-Red Tomato Seed<br />Burgess Seed Co., Galesburg, Mich.<br /><br />Spaghetti Squash<br />Shumway Seeds, Rockford, Ill.<br /><br />Illini-Chief Sweet Corn<br />Shumway and others<br /><br />Eat-All Squash and Sweetheart Beets<br />Farmer's Seed and Nursery,<br />Faribault, Minn.<br /></p>
