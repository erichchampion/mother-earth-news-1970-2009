                    <p>      So you want to start a rock shop . . . or do you? Maybe      you're dreaming instead of a little candle business you can      operate out of your home . . . or a leather shop . . . or      you've decided to put your painting on a paying basis . . .      or you're expecting an out-of-print book service to finance      your break from the 9-to-5 drag. No matter. Be it a home      mail-order operation or store-front employment service: The      bookkeeping, management, buying, markup, discount, zoning,      credit, insurance, tax, advertising and other problems of a      family business are much the same. The methods that work      for a rock shop will also work for the sandal maker, pet      shop and health food store . . . and the place to get those      methods is from a successful small shop proprietor.    </p>    <p>      Arthur E. Victor, assisted by his wife, Lila Mae Victor, is      that successful proprietor. The Victors, until their recent      semi-retirement, operated one of the world's better known      "rock hound" emporiums. Their two books, GEM TUMBLING AND      BAROQUE JEWELRY MAKING, ($2.00 and now in it's 18th      printing) and SO YOU WANT TO START A ROCK SHOP ($2.00 and      in the 5th printing) have helped hundreds of other      enthusiasts establish their own flourishing rock shops.    </p>    <p>      The following excerpts of the more general information from      SO YOU WANT TO START A ROCK SHOP should help anyone start      almost any small business on a sound basis. For more      details on the specifics of establishing a rock shop, get      both the Victor's books from: THE VICTORS, 1709 South      Cedar, Spokane, Washington 99203.<br />    </p>    <p>      Hundreds of thumbnail-sized rock shops start each year and      other hundreds quit or fail but so do the "failure" rates      of all businesses make dismal reading. Statistics are      against success and the saddest statistical facts are that      most failures could have been prevented. Poor planning, no      market analysis, insufficient capital and lack of technical      knowledge are all contributing factors but the amazing      thing is that most small business men are not aware of      their lack of "know how." This lack of knowledge is not a      sin (who among us can assert he knows EVERYTHING about      anything.) But he who knows not and knows not that he knows      not, is headed for serious trouble and in a hurry.<br />      <br />      Rather than belabor the reasons for failure, let us take      the positive approach. Many Rock Shops prosper and their      proprietors are happy, contented people-some have      grown to national prominence. And to the best of our      knowledge every one started in their back yard or glassed      in front porch, even as you and I.<br />      <br />      If this little book can help you plan your enterprise or at      least give you some indication of the type and kind of      knowledge needed for success, it will have served its      purpose.<br />      <strong><br /></strong>    </p>        <h3>      REQUIREMENTS OF A ROCK SHOP PROPRIETOR    </h3>    <p>      First, is capital; money to start the enterprise; to buy      the stock, carry the overhead costs, until sales develop to      a point where income is greater than output. Certainly this      amount will vary depending upon your particular      circumstances but there must be SOME money. Probably, five      years will pass before you can take money from the      business. During that time every dollar of profit will be      re-invested in building up the stock and improving the      shop.<br />      <br />      Then, there is your knowledge of the Lapidary field or a      specific field if you intend to specialize. You should know      the "jargon of the trade"-the descriptive terms      needed to order supplies and you must know what services      and supplies your prospective customers will expect you to      carry in stock. You must know something of business      methods, bookkeeping, stock control and profit and loss      statement. This bookkeeping knowledge is readily available      to you and can be easily acquired-but the technical      "know how" is not standardized and is not available except      by long and patient digging and we mean literally and      figuratively.<br />      <br />      Let us "personalize" this technical knowledge point by      applying it to your own activities. Suppose you are a first      class machinist (or an accountant or printer or almost any      occupation) and you have your own little shop. Your friend      drops in and says something like this-"I have sold      insurance for thirty years but I have always wanted a nice      little shop like this. I have saved a few bucks. What do      you think about me starting a little shop like      yours?"<br />      <br />      Hobby shops and Rockshops in particular are unlike any      other long established retail stores. Rockhounds are not in      a class with the person who tries every shoe in the shop      for an hour or so and suddenly says, "it has quit raining,      I can get out on the street now." The infinite variety, and      the creative artistry of our Rock hobby results in what we      might call "slow selling." The absorbing interest often      results in much delightful conversation with low dollar      volume of sales.<br />      <br />      So check your own personal characteristics-your      temperament. Do you like to visit? Do you enjoy meeting new      people? When you meet a stranger can you think of something      to say that will put him at ease and start him talking? Can      you be genuinely interested while Joe Blow tells you for an      hour how he found that big Geode up on Red Top, and all the      while a stack of orders to fill, letters to be answered, a      dozen rings to set, etc., etc., and dear Joe, thrilled at      his find, rambles on and on. How about the other members of      the family? Most little shops are a husband and wife      operation. Is the "other half" interested and willing to      work; and will you both be content to be "tied down" with a      shop?<br />      <br />      You must establish regular and consistent open hours for      the store. If you "live in the back of the shop" these open      hours will not deter your rockhound friends from dropping      in at all hours of the day or night.<br />    </p>        <p>      <br />    </p>    <h3>      LOCATION AND SIZE    </h3>    <p>      The ideal situation would be to select an area containing a      multitude of potential customers and set your little shop      in the most accessible spot. For most of us that will not      be possible or practical. The shop location is already      established. Maybe we are starting in the family home;      perhaps only one building is available in our end of town.      As a result of this fixed location we must depend upon      customers available to that location. Your original      investment may seem small and because of this you may think      that failure will not hurt very much. Once you are      committed the "returning will be as tedious as the going      over." The general tendency in small inexperienced      businesses is to attempt to bolster an unprofitable venture      with more and more resources until the drain becomes a      catastrophic financial loss and failure a terrible blow to      the pride.<br />    </p>    <p>      There is nothing standardized about this rock business. If      you wanted to start a drug store, pages of statistics are      available. Experience has shown that a given number of      people in a trade area spend so many dollars per year at a      drugstore, Divide that figure by the number of drug stores      and one has a rough idea of what to expect in gross sales.      There will be figures available concerning density of      traffic, car traffic, and buying habits. Nothing      approaching this type of information is available for a      rock shop. You are on your own when making a Market      Analysis for your shop. If you were contemplating starting      a shop you must of necessity planned to sell something to      somebody. All right, who are they-is it the      100-200-300-500 rock hounds in the trade area and how big      is this trade area? Will your customers be tourists or a      circle of friends? Will your customers come from immediate      areas or from all over town or even perhaps from the      surrounding countryside? Is your place of business easily      accessible to these customers? Can they find it easily?      Maybe you plan to make up and sell finished jewelry. What      and where are these potential customers now buying? Or are      you going to fill a need not now supplied by anyone? Are      there competing shops in your trade area? Suppose you are      able to compete successfully and divide the customers with      your competition--is there enough business for all shops or      will your opening develop a session of cutthroat      competition and as a result no one will make a profit, or      do you anticipate a growing market with room for all to      expand?    </p>    <h3>      ZONING ORDINANCE    </h3>    <p>      Find out about zoning ordinances. If starting in your      residence, you may discover restrictive regulations as to      type, size and character of business permitted. There will      be limitation on signs and outdoor displays.    </p>    <h3>      MANAGEMENT    </h3>    <p>      Many books have been written about Business Management.      Entire college courses are designed as Business      Administration. We can only hope to stimulate your interest      and outline a few basic principles. Your success will be      based upon a combination of knowledge and skills plus a      little luck and much common sense. One important bit of      knowledge is an awareness of your limitations and the will      to seek help and accept guidance.    </p>    <p>      Do not be reluctant or afraid to seek competent advice. The      Small Business Administration has a Service Corps of      Retired Executives. As the name implies, these are      successful business man who have retired, but who wish to      help others. They volunteer their services at no cost to      help other small business men with management problems. A      call or letter to your nearby Small Business Administration      office might provide you with a local experienced business      man to discuss your plans for starting or problems that may      disturb you after you are in business.<br />    </p>    <h3>      STOCKING    </h3>    <p>      Your first managerial decisions have dealt with the      establishment of the shop, probable growth, your own      ability and capital available. Now use the market analysis      to determine the kind and size of stock you will need. This      will be modified by what you have on hand as an      accumulation of years of hobby activity and will certainly      be controlled by the amount of money you want to invest (or      risk) in this new venture. Set up an account and list all      the shelves, show cases, office machines, tools,      signs-everything in the shop that is not "Merchandise      for sale." Add to this the cash you intend to invest, this      will be your capital account.    </p>    <p>      Make another inventory of all merchandise for sale. Figure      this on cost or market value, whichever is the lower. To      this inventory add everything you buy for sale and subtract      everything you sell. Note that you have two inventories,      one for items not for sale and another for those items that      are for sale. Keep these separate because at income tax      time they will have entirely different effects on profits      and depreciation figures.<br />    </p>    <p>      The amount of goods you buy will be governed by the amount      of money you have to invest, the stock on hand when you      started and the estimate of sales volume as determined from      your market analysis. No one but you can make the      decisions. No two situations will be identical, but here is      a good point to determine if you have something in which      you can excell in offering to the public. Try to find some      "Specialty" that you can advertise as unique to your shop.      Henry Kaiser said of his success: "Find a need and fill      it." Gauge your stock both as to quality and variety to      fill a need of your expected customers.    </p>    <p>      From your market analysis you have estimated gross sales      and decided upon the kind of variety of merchandise needed.      You also have an estimate of the overhead operating      expense-and don't forget you must maintain your      living expenses too. (One rock shop proprietor advised us      to say, "For the first three years there must be two      incomes-one to live on and one to support the shop.")    </p>    <h3>      BUYING    </h3>    <p>      All your life you have been buying as a consumer or an      investor. Now you are buying for immediate re-sale at a      profit (you hope) and an entirely new type of consideration      is required. As a merchandiser you must sell your stock and      buy more stock and sell that and buy more, each time taking      your mark-up as gross profit. Thus the more times you "turn      your stock" the more profit on the original investment.    </p>    <p>      Let us illustrate how important this idea of turnover      becomes especially if you have only limited capital.      Suppose you use $75.00 of capital money and buy $75.00      worth of merchandise to be sold for $100.00. It arrives and      you sell it. $75.00 is used to replace the merchandise and      $25.00 is considered gross profit. If you do that four      times in a year you will have a gross profit of $100.00 on      a capital investment of $75.00.    </p>    <p>      Some shops may approximate the operation of a small      community hardware store. These stores have a record of      perhaps a three-time turn over of stock. Thus their stock      value would be one-third the annual sales. The mark-up on      most hardware items is about the same as lapidary equipment      and supplies and a three-time turnover seems to be      reasonable in determining profit from the operation. If      turn over runs to four times per year perhaps larger stock      purchases would be indicated with subsequent reduction in      unit costs. If the turnover drops to one and      one-half-perhaps profit would be improved by smaller      purchases and a reduction of stock.<br />    </p>    <p>      As a very rough estimate and guide you might consider your      stock value should about equal the first year's gross      sales.    </p>    <p>      Business management is much more than purchasing stock and      watching inventory. It includes pricing, checking costs of      operation, alertness to change and constant attention to a      multitude of details. We have enlarged upon stock control      because it will be one of your first considerations and      seems to be a source of trouble to most small inexperienced      shops.    </p>    <h3>      MARKUP AND DISCOUNT    </h3>    <p>      "Markup" is a percentage of purchase price and "discount"      is a percentage of selling price. On any one item the      actual dollar figure will be identical but the percentages      will be different. As an example, an item costing $75.00 is      to retail at $100.00. The gross profit will be $25.00.      Figured as markup this $25.00 is 33-1/3% of the cost of      $75.00 so we say the "markup" is 33-1/3%-This $25.00      gross profit is 25% of the selling price of $100.00 so we      say you purchased at a 25% discount.    </p>    <p>      The term "retail price" or "list price" as used by a      wholesale firm have the identical function, that is, a      figure to use when determining discount, but the term "list      price" may or may not represent an accurate or reliable      retail price.    </p>    <p>      As an example a $10.00 retail price item (list price) may      be quoted at wholesale something like this. Retail (or      list) $10, 1 to 6 items, 15% discount; 7 to 11-20%; 12 to      24 at 25%; over 24 at 30%.<br />      <br />      There is good reason for this change in discounts as you      will soon discover. Let us take an extreme example. Your      customer wants a cap and jump ring to fit a special stone.      For one-half hour he tries every cap in the place on the      stone and finally makes a great decision. You charge him      ten  cents for the cap and five  cents for the ring. You put      them in an envelope, it cost money, and write up the sale      on sales slip and that cost money. The customer may say      something about the high price of findings or may wonder      why you don't get a horse and a gun. You sold those items      at over 1000% mark-up but you lost money on the      transaction. The next customer wants a gross of caps and an      ounce of jump rings. You charge him $5.00. The sale is made      in ten minutes. Your mark-up probably was 35% but you made      $1.50 gross profit.<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      Mark-up must be adjusted item by item and also by volume or      size of individual sale. The varying mark-up must average      out 25% to 30% of gross sales or you will be in serious      trouble.<br />      <br />      Such standard items as picks, saws, machinery, grinding      wheels and grits, sanding cloth, have a suggested retail      price established by the supplier. Don't cut these prices.      His experience, much broader than yours, has shown that      these suggested retail prices are the minimum that must be      charged to produce a reasonable profit. He is just as      interested in meeting competitive prices as you are, but he      also wants you to make a profit so you can grow in size and      become a permanent outlet for his merchandise. We keep      repeating that gross profit is not net profit. It takes net      profit to buy groceries. Gross profit is up near the middle      of the balance sheet-that little figure called net      profit down in the lower right hand corner is the important      one.    </p>    <h3>      PURCHASE ORDERS    </h3><p>Do not write out your orders in the form of letters and    intersperse your requests for merchandise with comments about    the weather or your latest attack of arthritis. Use a    separate letter and use a printed purchase order form for    ordering. Number these purchase orders and keep a copy. You    may specify method of shipment and delivery date.<br />    <br />    When opening an account with a supply house don't just    scribble a note on any old piece of paper and say "Send me so    many of such and such. My state tax number is so and so."    Write a nice letter on good printed stationery. Tell him who    you are, something of your volume or how much you anticipate    purchasing from him. Give a reference such as your bank. Be    sure to include a state or city tax or license number if    required in your community. You will be surprised at the    friendly helpful letter you will receive in return. You may    know quite a little about him but he knows nothing about    you-so introduce yourself. Along this same line-a    word of praise or appreciation for a favor or a good service    will prove to be most helpful.</p>    <h3>      ROCKS AND SLABS    </h3>    <p>      Word travels fast by grapevine and the new, inexperienced      rock shop will soon be visited by all the local traders,      all the truck sellers and tailgaters within reach. They      will offer you the 'last of this available' or a special      hand-picked something or other. Purely and solely to help      you, they will even be willing to trade some of their stone      for THEIR SELECTION of your stone. Unless you know what you      are doing, don't do it!<br />      <br />      First class agate is continually rising in price as the      demand increases. You may be shocked to discover agate you      purchased five years ago at fifty  cents per pound retail,      now quoted at $1.35 per pound wholesale in 100 pound lots.      Suppose you buy 100 pounds of this $1.35 stone. How do you      price it to your customers who buy one-half pound to five      pounds at a time?<br />      <br />      Let us follow that stone and see what happened to it before      you got it. First, it was mined or picked up and sold to      your supplier as "mine run" or "field run" at perhaps      thirty  cents per pound.<br />      <br />      Suppose this supply house bought 1000 pounds for $300.00.      To make a reasonable profit it should be sold somewhere      near $750.00 which would be $75.00 per 100 not $135.00. But      this was "mine run" so it must be graded-perhaps it      grades out something like this: 250 pounds hi-grade, 300      pounds medium grade, 300 pounds poorer grade and 150 pounds      country rock worthless stuff. Depending upon many factors      the supplier might elect to reach his $750.00 selling price      by pricing the grades as follows: 250 pounds hi-grade,      $1.35; 300 pounds medium grade, $1.00; 300 pounds poor      grade at fifty  cents. This would bring in just a little      over the $750.00. <strong><br /></strong><br />      Now you have that 100 pounds of stone. It cost you $135.00      plus freight and you (as your supplier did) decide that you      must sell it for $275.00 (in the little sales) to make a      reasonable profit. A few kinds of stone may be of such      uniformity that you could throw the entire 100 pounds in      the bin for customer selection at $2.75 per pound. Many,      many kinds of stone, even well graded stones, will vary in      desirability by color, markings or shape, stone by stone.      Such a stone if uniformly priced for customer selection      would probably result in a fourth of bin remaining of      unwanted stones. To lower the price on this residue is to      lose money and no customer is happy to return to your shop      and find the price reduced after he made his      purchase.<br />      <br />      Two things can be done to alleviate the problem of residue      stone. First and least desirable, simply raise the price      and finally dispose of the rejects at a bulk price or cut      or tumble it yourself. The second and more desirable method      would be to price the stone piece by piece-to a total      of that $275.00.<br />      <br />      This way the customer has the choice of selecting two      stones of equal size-one a perfect stone for $1.50      the other imperfect at $1.00. He may elect to take the      poorer stone but he feels good about it. You have been fair      with him and all the subsequent customers who will pick      over the pile.    </p>    <p>      Don't.ever, ever put a per pound price on a pile of stone      and when a customer picks out a particularly beautiful      stone tell him "that is too good a stone to sell at the      regular price, I will have to have $3.00 per pound for that      one." If he doesn't do you bodily harm on the spot you can      be sure he will never return.    </p>    <p>      Now another thing to watch, particularly as you start, is      this pile of stone in the back yard. Collected over many      years, the supply of jewelry bragging rocks, mineral      specimens, chrystals and whatever else you may have      accumulated is now called merchandise for sale. You may      consider a sale at any price virtually clear profit because      it cost very little in money. Watch it! That stock will      have to be replaced at current wholesale prices and unless      you know your prices and recognize value you may find you      have sold it much below wholesale replacement cost.    </p>    <p>      Somewhere we said something about the desirability of      having a display of finished material or specimens or      bragging rock as examples of the lapidary art or to      stimulate interest in the hobby. If you have such a display      and it is not for sale mark it plainly so the customer will      know it is only for display. Don't let him unknowingly pick      out a piece and ask the price only to be told "that is not      for sale."    </p>    <p>      Everybody starting a shop wants to know where to buy. This      information comes with experience and trial and error plus      perhaps, considerable expense. Look through the      advertisements in the Rock Magazines, <em>(listed at the      end of this article)</em> <em>.</em> Transportation will be      one of your costs of goods so select a wholesale house near      you and perhaps one in another part of the country. Send      for their catalogues and tell them, as has been suggested      previously, who you are and what you expect to do-and      always send your Sales Tax Account number and local license      number. In comparing prices be sure you know the quality      involved and don't send for catalogues from everybody      expecting that someone will be way down low on price.      Competition being what it is, you will find merchandise of      similar quality somewhere near the same price wherever you      buy it.    </p>    <p>      As a beginning shop your purchases will of necessity be in      small quantity and limited variety. Don't scatter these      little purchases throughout a dozen supply sources. Give      your orders to two or three reliable firms. As you grow in      volume and experience; as you learn the "jargon of the      trade" and understand the quality and descriptive terms;      and as you learn what merchandise your customers      want-then begin to explore the possibility of finding      specialized sources of supply. Buy what your customers      want. Don't be governed by your personal likes or dislikes      but do not compromise on quality, and, don't handle      merchandise that you know will not stand up in use (even if      there is customer request for it.) Findings that tarnish      quickly and machinery with poor bearings, too light a      construction, or poorly designed (even if low priced) will      not build confidence in the reliability of your shop. You      may lose a few sales but not a customer.    </p>    <p>      There are many items desirable as stock such as gold pans      and tools that must be purchased from sources basically      outside the lapidary field. Consult the wholesale houses      via the telephone book because these items may not be      advertised or available from lapidary supply houses and can      probably be purchased locally with no transportation      charges involved.    </p>    <p>      One final word about buying. Pay your bills when due;      conform to the wholesalers sales policy; and take all cash      discounts.    </p>    <h3>      TAX NUMBERS AND LICENSES    </h3>    <p>      A license is a permit or an authorization and may carry      with it requirements of public health, safety, sanitation,      fire protection and in some instances technical and      financial qualifications.    </p>    <p>      The fee is usually small and paid each year upon renewal. A      license may be cancelled for cause.    </p>    <p>      Tax Numbers or as they may be called "Registration      Certificates,°" are usually issued for the duration of      the business and are not renewed each year. Sales taxes      vary by locality and may include the state, the county, and      the city. Call the various taxing agencies listed in the      phone book or call your local Better Business Bureau or the      Small Business Administration. Some states and cities levy      a tax upon all business and occupations, usually upon total      volume regardless of profit. All these taxes will have      rules which you must follow and keep records subject to      audit by the taxing unit. Be sure to tell the taxing unit      the details about your proposed shop-what you will be      selling, wholesale and retail and some indication of your      expected volume. The volume and nature of your business may      determine the reporting period which may be by the month or      the quarter or in some small shops by the year.    </p>    <p>      Sales taxes are not designed to become a tax upon a tax.      The consumer pays an excise tax only once, when he buys      from the retailer for his own use and ultimate consumption.      Goods purchased for re-sale pay no excise tax.    </p>    <p>      Your wholesaler is not a policeman. He will not follow an      item of merchandise into your shop and check on whether or      not you use it or sell it, or whether you collect the      correct tax but (and this is MOST important) he must be      assured that you understand the terms of the sale; that YOU      KNOW OF YOUR OBLIGATION TO COLLECT THE TAX according to the      law and that this obligation is a PART OF THE CONDITION      UNDER WHICH HE SELLS THE GOODS. Furthermore, he wants that      "certified" in writing.    </p>    <p>      Regardless of whether or not he requires you to sign a      lengthy statement or only asks for your excise tax account      number of if you only state on an order "for resale; tax      number so and so" you have obligated yourself to collect      the excise tax. Ignorance of this law is no excuse and you      may be subjected to a lot of embarrassment, delinquent      penalties, heavy fine and even imprisonment. You might      discover yourself "breaking rocks" not polishing them!    </p>    <h3>      CREDIT    </h3>    <p>      You'll find it to your advantage to establish a credit      standing from the very start. Check the telephone book and      call your nearest Dun & Bradstreet office. A credit      reporter will stop by and ask questions about your business      experience, assets (cash and property; insurance) and your      liabilities (debts, mortgage obligations.) Tell him all the      facts. When you identify yourself to a new supplier to      obtain credit, you can then refer him to Dun &      Bradstreet.    </p>    <p>      Credit is essential to business growth; few businesses can      afford to operate on a strictly cash basis. You'll find a      credit rating valuable in establishing new sources of      supply and in keeping open the flow of goods to your      business.    </p>    <p>      How much credit should you grant to customers? The answer      is none-Do a cash business.<br />    </p>    <h3>      INSURANCE    </h3>    <p>      One of the hidden costs of doing business is a little      matter of insurance. Probably you now carry fire, theft and      personal liability You may find these policies (in fine      print) exclude and do not cover any type of retail business      activity. So if in your own home or separate business      building, now open to the public, you will need      storekeepers liability, fire and theft on goods for sale,      and personal liability. This broad coverage may cost you      from $1.50; to $2.00 per day for your home and stock but      you can't afford to take the chances of defending a one      hundred thousand dollar law suit for damages to a customer      who fell on the icy sidewalk or fell through a glass show      case.<br />    </p>    <h3>      BOOKKEEPING    </h3>    <p>      In the days before sales tax, business and occupation tax,      and income tax if we came to the end of a year with a few      bucks in the bank, the shelves stocked and the bills paid,      we felt pretty good and it was no concern to anyone      else.<br />      <br />      Now, every penny of expense must be recorded in its proper      place-goods purchased for sale, repairs, supplies,      advertising, labor, transportation, office supplies, taxes,      rent, power, light, telephone, interest, travel and more.      Every penny taken in by sale, trade or labor, interest or      rent must be classified as to source and then reclassified      as to wholesale, retail, subject to local or state (or      both) sales tax. It may have to be classified again to meet      a varying business and occupation (B & O) tax on      different types of services or goods.<br />      <br />      Sound complicated? Well, it is, and unless you are      thoroughly familiar with the accounts needed, consult a      good accountant, or tax consultant. He will set up a      comparatively simple system by which these records can be      maintained. We cannot emphasize too much the necessity of      doing this WHEN YOU START. Don't wait six months or until      the end of the year. You will find you can't remember when      you acquired that big saw or whether you had 500 or 1000      pounds of a certain rock when you started. Another      bookkeeping item is a ledger book for accounts receivable.      You may try as hard as you can to do a full cash business      but there will be people who owe you money-maybe only      for a few days or until they receive an invoice. Record      these in the ledger and keep it accurate.<br />      <br />      All this bookkeeping is really a blessing in disguise      because from these records you can tell how your business      is progressing. Trouble spots will show very soon and      corrections can be made. Accounting has been called the      voice of a business-listen to it.<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      Bookkeeping services are available for hire and the fees      are not excessive. These services are flexible and can be      adjusted to suit your source documents (sales slips, bills,      invoices, cash receipts, etc.) and using them as the record      of original entries to a complicated and sophisticated      system which would involve all of the multitude of books,      ledgers and account classifications needed; or arrangements      (and training) might be provided for the average person to      maintain the records himself, with an occasional audit and      annual summary by the expert Accountant.<br />      <br />      Don't go overboard. All you will need is a comparatively      simple, single entry system. Until you grow into a $100,000      business you will not need the complicated accounting      systems used by large corporations.<br />      <br />      Start this by identifying the sale in the left hand column,      either by name or sales number. The next entry would be the      total cash received including all taxes. The next column      heading might be "State Sales Tax Collected," and the next      "City Sales Tax."<br />      <br />      At the end of a tax paying period the column totals will      give the information needed. On a separate sheet under      these same column heads, the monthly totals can be entered      consecutively to make a convenient month to month and year      by year record for managerial use.<br />      <br />      These sales records must be accurate and balanced at the      monthly or quarterly tax paying period and you will be so      much interested in "How the business is doing" that you      will have an incentive to take the time each day to keep      them up to date.<br />      <br />      No monthly or quarterly reports are required of      expenditures. Once each year, at income tax time, you will      be required by law, to determine these figures. There is a      great tendency to neglect this most important part of your      records. Expenditures paid by check are not much of a      problem. You have the check stub and always the cancelled      check. Questions might arise as to the purpose of      expenditure, but the expenditure is on record.<br />      <br />      The cash expenditures are the neglected and forgotten items      that can cost you real money come income tax time. Be sure      to keep the invoices or make a memoranda slip for every      out-of-pocket purchase; list stamps, light bulbs, fuses, a      quart of paint, wrapping paper, travel expense, parking,      etc.<br />      <br />      As with the record of sales, these expenditure totals, by      month and years, can be transferred to a summary sheet and      as the months and years go by will be invaluable for      comparative purposes and as a tool of management.<br />    </p>    <h3>      ADVERTISING    </h3>    <p>      Advertising is designed to draw BUYING customers to your      shop. In this lapidary business we have the problem of      promoting the acceptance of the hobby in addition to      drawing customers to a particular shop.<br />      <br />      Considering our competitive status we should support the      Gem Shows in our trade area and provide interesting      displays of the lapidary art at every opportunity, not only      for our Rockhound customers but for the information of the      general public. Provide the local newspapers with human      interest stories and pictures of outstanding      accomplishments of your rockhound friends. Don't push      yourself or your shop into the story. Reporters are under      constant pressure from publicity seekers and they will cut      the whole thing if they have the slightest idea you are      trying to obtain free advertising. Take advantage of every      opportunity to build good will for the Rock hobby.<br />      <br />      A listing in the classified section of the telephone      directory is a must. Perhaps two or three listings such as      Lapidary, Agates and Jewelry would be advantageous.<br />      <br />      Advertising is another of your managerial duties which      requires planning, direction and purpose to fit your      individual conditions. Don't plunge in spasmodically and      intermittently, with an advertisement now and then. Plan      your campaign; set up a budget for the year. (Some retail      stores spend 3% gross income for advertising.)<br />      <br />      Decide what people you want to reach and what goods or      services you wish to sell. Your budget will be small and      space limited so don't try to sell everything and spoil an      ad with too much detail. Elsewhere we have suggested a      specialization in one or two items or the development of a      unique product to make your shop distinctive-here is      a chance to "cash in" on that specialization. Use it in      your advertising.<br />    </p>    <p>      Advertising in our Rock hobby magazines is effective over      long periods of time. Those magazines are saved and read      and re-read. You will be getting replies from      advertisements two and three years after they are issued.    </p>    <p>      Look through the Rockshop ads and pick out one that appeals      to you. Then copy its style and layout. Most of the      advertising outlets will help lay out your ad and make      suggestions.    </p>    <p>      Advertising is a full time profession requiring alertness      to new opportunities and new techniques but here are a few      do's and don'ts that may be helpful.    </p>    <p>      Don't ever, ever tell a half-truth or misrepresent in any      way.<br />      Don't try to say too much-keep it simple.<br />      Don't use stock phrases, cliches and stereotype      phrases.<br />      Do try to make the ad interesting; easy to read.<br />      Do try to make answering easy. If you are selling mail      order make your price post-paid if at all possible.<br />      Be sure all conditions of sale are listed. If there are      minimum or maximum or sizes or number list them      distinctly.<br />      Don't brag or boast. Your item may be excellent, large,      complete, first grade, but be very cautious with words like      THE BIGGEST, THE BEST, THE ONLY, WORLD FAMOUS.<br />      Do stick to your advertising budget. Set aside a few      dollars for emergency use for unexpected opportunities.    </p>    <p>      Keep records of your advertising expenditures and compare      with sales and profits. You will learn which type of      advertising brings the best results and eventually you will      be able to make the best possible use of the advertising      outlay.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps this is a good place to mention books and      magazines, not only as profitable merchandise for sale but      as help in building public knowledge and increased interest      in the hobby. Always carry a good supply.    </p>    <p>      Another item of good will and possible profit is formal      class instruction in the lapidary art. You should not have      secrets about how to cut, polish and mount stones.      Encourage classes in all phases of the rock hobby under      whatever sponsorship.<br />    </p>    <h3>      COMPETITION    </h3>    <p>      A hobbyist will visit more stores and spend more time      negotiating the purchase of a $10 gadget than he will in      spending $500 to put a new roof on the house.    </p>    <p>      Rockhounds are no exception. Don't ever get the idea that      you will become the sole source of supply for anyone. Your      customers are going to visit your competition and they all      read and study the catalogues. You can't sell everything to      everybody; all you can hope to do is attract a portion of      the trade. There is no need and you are not obligated to      advertise your competition but if Joe Blow wants an 8"      sawblade and you don't have one in stock, send him down the      street or better, call up your competition and tell him you      are sending a man to him for a saw blade. Your first      consideration is the convenience of your customer not to      prevent your competition from selling a saw blade.    </p>    <p>      If a customer asks about other rock shops, tell him where      they are and say something good about them. If you can't      think of anything praiseworthy say something about the      lovely shrubbery or the nice picket fence or the lovely      pink paint on his store front. Whatever you do don't knock      competition-it's a deadly boomerang.<br />    </p>    <p>      Try to be something above just another Rock Shop.      Specialize in something; become known as the shop with the      big display of bookends, or findings, or maybe good slabbed      material. In other words excel in one or two items. Don't      try to specialize in the same thing the other fellow      features. For example, if your competition has a big and      beautiful supply of mineral specimens don't try to outdo      him, but feature something else like findings-have a      complete line. You may soon have him sending customers to      you for findings and you will be sending customers to him      for specimen material and both of you will be doing a nice      business. Thus, you will find more and more ways to      cooperate to build good will.<br />    </p>    <h3>      APPRAISAL AND IDENTIFICATION    </h3>    <p>      As the run of the mine Rockhound you probably helped many      people identify their finds and discussed at length      locations and hunting areas. Now as a rock shop proprietor      you will discover that activity is increased a hundred      times.    </p>    <p>      Don't consider it a profitless waste of time. Remember back      when you started rock hunting. Perhaps you can recall those      who helped you and haven't you had a warm spot in your      heart for those people-you may also remember the      gruff "That is nothing but junk" answer that others gave      you.    </p>    <p>      You will find many customers know a lot more about stones      than you do or they may have vast and detailed knowledge of      a specialized field, so don't try to fool anybody. You will      learn a lot more by just listening.<br />    </p>    <p>      From these beginners who seek your help will come the      customers for machinery and supplies in the years to follow      and don't forqet a satisfied friendly customer is your best      advertisement. A dollar's worth of time spent to make a      friend of a potential rockhound may be far better      advertising than a $10.00 ad in a magazine.<br />    </p>    <h3>      WHAT'S IN A NAME?    </h3>    <p>      Shakespeare said it-but Bill lived long before these      days of high pressure selling and psychological      advertising. Give a little thought as to how your shop name      will sound to a complete stranger. All your friends may      call you Fred or Jack or Pinkie but how many are there with      similar names. Even the most common names of Smith or      Johnson are better than a first name. Smith Brothers made a      cough drop famous-would Fred & Joe's cough drop      have been as effective as Smith Brothers?    </p>    <p>      Ordinarily thumbnail-sized operations should take the name      of the owner with one, or at most, two descriptive words.      Smith Agates, Smith's Lapidary Supplies are good. Smith's      Rock Shop and Lapidary is too long. Now if you have some      big long unpronounceable name, even though it be a proud      name carried back to the Revolution or the nobility in the      old country, better leave it out of the title and call      yourself some short combination of descriptive terms such      as Lapidary Supply Company or maybe make up a word or name      from some of the syllables in your own or your wife's name;      or the initials of say Katherine and Sylvester might be the      K & S Rock Shop; or Frances and Thomas might be      combined as was done to make the well known Frantom      Lapidary Company.    </p>    <p>      We never know what the future growth will be so select a      name suitable for use if your business grows beyond its      little circle of friends or the city or state.    </p>    <h3>      HONESTY    </h3>    <p>      The finest asset any rock shop can possess is a reputation      for just plain common honesty.    </p>    <p>      Describe your merchandise truthfully. Your customer may      have little knowledge of values now, but he will eventually      learn. You may think you are a "smart business man" when      you sell someone a fifty cent stone for one dollar, but      that little trick may cost you the sale of a $400 saw at      some future date when that customer discovers he was      "taken". If he does come back he will examine every      purchase with a cautious, suspicious attitude.    </p>    <p>      Don't "over sell" a customer. Don't try to sell him ten      pounds of expensive polishing oxide when you know he will      not use two pounds in a year. And don't reverse the process      and "under sell" him. Don't tell him the 12" slab saw you      have in stock is adequate to cut the book ends he wants      from those big petrified logs.    </p>    <p>      Know your equipment and machinery well enough to be      familiar with its limitations as well as its strong points.      DO NOT SELL MACHINERY OR MERCHANDISE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING      TO SUPPLEMENT THE MANUFACTURER'S GUARANTEE WITH YOUR OWN      REPUTATION.    </p>    <p>      The small community rock shop for whom this book is      intended must depend upon the repeat customer-the      fellow who spends five, ten or fifteen dollars a month and      occasionally buys a piece of machinery.    </p>    <p>      A repeat customer only returns because of his confidence in      your advice and guidance and in the assurance he is getting      his money's worth in quality.    </p>    <p>      Another point, so many of us have such poor memories that      we should stay very close to the truth at all times.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONCLUSION</strong>    </p>        <p>      Starting and developing your own business can be a most      gratifying and pleasant experience and we have endeavored      to encourage those who have a reasonable chance for      success. On the other hand, we hope those whose only      qualification for starting a rock shop is unbounded      enthusiasm, will be stimulated to find a specialized field      for their venture.    </p>    <p>      To those of you not in business we hope we have given a      little insight into the problems and frustrations of the      Rock Shop operator to the end that you may be a little more      tolerant of their "shortcomings" and perhaps a bit more      appreciative of the fine service so many are providing.    </p>    <p>      We hope we have revived the memories of some of the      suppliers, the wholesale, the manufacturer, the importer.      Recall those few short years ago when you, too, considered      an order for ten gross of caps, 100 pounds of stone, or a      slab saw as a major decision, requiring a consultation of      the entire family and a long look at the bank balance.      These are little shops now but some of them will grow and      they will grow because they fill a need for friendly      helpful service.    </p>    <h3>      MAGAZINES DEVOTED TO THE LAPIDARY<br />      AND RELATED HOBBIES:    </h3>    <p>      Earth Science Digest<br />      P.
