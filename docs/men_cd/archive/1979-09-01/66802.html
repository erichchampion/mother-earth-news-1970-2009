                    <p>      <em>As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over      again.<br />      <br /></em> <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings      today: still clearing brush, still building honest stone      houses (Helen and Scott are famous for their stone houses),      and still raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves      in unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.<br />      <br /></em> <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the      Nearings have learned a few things about homesteading and      getting back to basics over the years. And, lucky for all      of us, they've agreed to share some of that knowledge with      MOTHER's readers in a regular question and answer column.      If you'd like to get in on the action, send your question      or questions about self-sufficient living on the land to      Helen and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we</em> all <em>can      read what the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>        <p>      I've admired both of you for the last couple of years      through articles in such lofty magazines as THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted), Organic Gardening, and Farmstead. I've      read Living the Good Life, and I'm now in the process of      finishing Our Sun-Heated Greenhouse.    </p>    <p>      My problem, however, is that I'm an incurable cynic,      and-though I've read that Scott did, at one time,      destroy many dollars' worth of bonds-no mention is      ever made of the use of what must be large sums, indeed,      from your royalties and speaking engagements.    </p>    <p>      Now-while I have no doubts that you've earned your      necessary cash from maple syrup in Vermont and blueberries      in Maine-having those royalties available does put      you at an advantage when compared to other homesteaders. Do      you have a charity for this money, or do you keep it (even      though you probably have no need for it)? I can't picture      you letting the publisher retain that "income", as he or      she certainly makes enough profit from you.    </p>    <p>      Anyway . . . good health and good life!    </p>    <p>      None of the money comes to us personally. We've arranged      for all royalties and speaking fees to go to a publication      fund that uses the income to get out our economic and      political books . . . which most commercial publishers      reject out of hand. Scott's last three books (The Making of      a Radical, Man's Search for the Good Life, and Civilization      and Beyond) were turned down by half a dozen firms. We then      published them ourselves. (The burning of the German      municipal bonds that you mentioned was described on page 47      of Scott's autobiography, The Making of a Radical.)    </p>    <p>      Let us add a postscript to this last question, regarding a      mention of one of Scott's books in our column in MOTHER NO.      55. This offer brought a deluge of dollar bills for the      little book The Conscience of a Radical. However, the      postage amounted to 48 cents and the mailing envelopes cost      8 cents each, so we went in the hole on that one . . . and      are running out of books, having only clothbound copies      left at $3.00.    </p>    <p>      If anyone wants a list of all our books, he or she can      write Social Science Institute (which is the name of our      publishing venture), Harborside, Maine 04642 . . .      enclosing a stamped, self-addressed envelope. We keep the      cost of our books low, as we don't aim to profiteer off      them. But, when ordering any volumes from us, please add      $1.00 for postage and handling.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Would you please give me your views on the priorities that      should be given to the various chores that are necessary      for the establishment of a "new" homestead? (We will begin      work in the late spring or early summer.) I specifically      wonder in which order the following jobs should be tackled:      [1] build a winterproof shelter, [2] begin a garden, [3]      construct animal buildings, and [4] cut firewood to allow      it to season.    </p>    <p>      Also, I would like to know if you've read <em>Growth of the      Soil</em> by Knut Hamsun. If not, allow me to recommend it as a      very inspirational piece of writing. If so, would you be      kind enough to share your opinions of the book with me?    </p>    <p>      Where are you situated? If your new home is near the Arctic      Circle, then constructing a shelter and cutting firewood      should have priority. If you're in southern latitudes, on      the other hand, getting in a garden is probably best. We      wouldn't consider animal buildings at all, as we don't keep      domestic animals.    </p>    <p>      <em>Growth of the Soil is</em> an important volume on country living      and early homesteading. We read it long ago, and-if      it were still in our library-we would reread it to      offer our present thoughts. Alas, our best books are loaned      out and often not returned, so we no longer have this one.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      My husband and I would dearly love to become homesteaders      (or at least we believe we would). We've lived in the city      all our lives, and we don't know anything about country      life . . . but we'd like to try it. How should we go about      making the change to rural living? My husband only makes      $6,000 a year, and I stay at home with our one-year-old      daughter. I doubt if we could get a loan for land. Perhaps      you could give us some insights.    </p>    <p>      If you're just toying with the idea of living on the land,      the wisest thing for you to do would be to stay in town. It      takes grit, perseverance, and know-how to succeed at      homesteading. Contrary to common opinion, the      back-to-the-land life isn't an undertaking for incompetent      dropouts. It takes considerable time and talent . . .      and-in the beginning-an outlay of working      capital.    </p>    <p>      Homesteading is a real change of lifestyle, and we wouldn't      advise anyone to go into it without a serious commitment.      You can't just flirt with the idea: You've got to know what      you're about and be prepared to invest large blocks of time      and energy to produce results.    </p>    <p>      For example: When our garden wire fence rusted out after 10      years of use, we faced the problem of buying a new fence or      building a stone wall around the garden. We decided in      favor of the wall and spent the next 14 years building it.      That was a serious commitment, although it only required a      few hours a day of our time over the years.    </p>    <p>      We also lived in an old wooden house in Maine for 20 years      while we put together plans, materials, and capital to      build our present new stone house. Rome was not bullt in a      day. You must make your plans . . . work hard to complete      them . . . and stick to the job. If you do so, you can      accomplish your goals.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      What's your opinion of Garden Way carts? Have you ever      owned one? What type of wheelbarrow do you believe is the      best to have?    </p>    <p>      For a long time we read Garden Way ads but didn't buy one      of their carts . . . because we didn't want just another      gadget. We already had four sturdy, rubber-tired      contractor's wheelbarrows and thought they were enough . .      . though many times our garden, blueberry patch, and      building operations kept all four in use at the same time.    </p>    <p>      Finally-three years ago-we ordered a Garden Way      kit and put their largest cart together. We've used it ever      since . . . and with growing enthusiasm. The "hauler" is as      useful (except for very heavy loads, such as rocks) as two      or three wheelbarrows. It's well machined and carefully      balanced, with the result that the weight is carried by the      cart's wheels . . . rather than on the arms of the      operator.    </p>
