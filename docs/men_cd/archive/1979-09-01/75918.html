        <h3>PLAYIN' IT SAFE</h3><p>An ideal "no-tipping" swing for toddlers can be made from one end of a wooden box . . . or put together, from scratch, using<br />four pieces of scrap wood. The trick, however, is to thread the rope through two holes in each side of this box-type<br />construction ... so your small-fry will have a particularly safe-while-swinging seat.</p><h3>BATHROOM PINUPS</h3><p>Screw a number of spring-type clothespins to a wood panel and attach the<br />assembly to the bathroom wall. This handy device can then hold washcloths<br />so they'll dry quickly .. . and-if you paint names on the pins-each family member<br />can quickly identify his or her own cloth.</p><h3>BATTLE BOTTLE ODOR</h3><p>To deodorize a foul-smelling bottle, simply fill the container with cold water . . . add a pinch of dry mustard ... let<br />the solution stand for about one hour . . . then rinse well.</p><h3>A SLIP-PROOF SIDEWALK</h3><p>Here's an autumn shop project that will eliminate the necessity of using salt or ashes on icy sidewalks this winter. Cut<br />small slits in two lengths of discarded garden hose and drive nails through these into a series of evenly spaced boards. When the auxiliary walk isn't needed,<br />it can be rolled up and stored away.</p><p><strong>PET POWER</strong></p><p>Your dog or cat can come and go at will if you hinge the lower part of a screen door and install long coil springs on<br />both sides. These should exert equal tension .. which will keep the pet door closed, yet allow the animal to push its<br />way either in or out.</p><h3>A TEMPORARY WHEELCHAIR</h3><p>. . . can be made from most any straight-backed chair. All you have to do is drill holes in the ends of the chair legs<br />and insert casters (large-sized, rubber-tired ones are best, but other types will work, too). Of course, the occupant will<br />need an assistant to push him or her along.</p><h3>SHAKER SEALS</h3><p>If you've misplaced any corks from your salt or pepper shakers-or if the stoppers<br />have a habit of coming loose-seal the holes with a small strip of tape.</p><h3>ANIMAL-PROOF GARBAGE CAN</h3><p>Drive a steel rod approximately two feet into the ground and cap the post with a U-shaped pipe ... the other end of which fits<br />through a neatly drilled hole in the can's lid. Not even the biggest dog in the neighborhood for the forest's wiliest raccoon)<br />will be able to tip your trash over again.</p><p><strong>September- October</strong></p><h3>SEPTEMBER</h3><p><strong>1</strong> Edgar Rice Burroughs' birthday, 1875</p><p><strong>2</strong> Mark Anthony defeated, 31 B.C.; Great fire in London begins, 1666</p><p><strong>3</strong> Revolutionary War officially ends, 1783</p><p><strong>4</strong> Henry Hudson discovers Manhattan, 1609; First self-service restaurant opens in<br />N.Y.C. 1885</p><p><strong>5</strong> Jesse James birthday, 1847; Raquel Welch's birthday, 1942</p><p><strong>6</strong> Cat nights (as opposed to dog days) commence</p><p><strong>7</strong> Grandma Moses' birthday, 1908</p><p><strong>8</strong> Peter Seller's birthday, 1925</p><p><strong>9</strong> Leo Tolstoy's birthday, 1828, Otis Redding's birthday, 1941</p><p><strong>10</strong> Lincoln Highway-to the first coast-to-coast, paved road-opens, 1913</p><p><strong>11</strong> First recorded tickest scalping: Jenny Lind concert in N.Y.C., 1850</p><p><strong>12</strong> John and Jackle Kennedy marry, 1953</p><p><strong>13</strong> Libya hits record temperature of 136.4F</p><p><strong>14</strong> Dante dies, 1321</p><p><strong>15</strong> James Fenimore Cooper's birthday, 1789; Agatha Christie's birthday 1891</p><p><strong>16</strong> Oklahoma Land Rush, 1893</p><p><strong>17</strong> Ken Kesey's birthday, 1935; Hank Williams' birthday, 1923</p><p><strong>18</strong> First issue of the New York Times, 1851</p><p><strong>19</strong> Mickey Mouse makes acting debut, 1928</p><p><strong>20</strong> Equal Rights Party forms and nominated Belva Lockwood for President, 1884</p><p><strong>21</strong> U.S.'s first daily newspaper published in Pennsylvania, 1784</p><p><strong>22</strong> Last eight witches hanged in Salem, Massachusetts, 1692</p><p><strong>23</strong> First Keystone comedy, 1912</p><p><strong>24</strong> First official U.S. autopsy (paid for with a "hogshead of tobacco"), 1657</p><p><strong>25</strong> Ford Motor Company established eight-hour day, five-day week, 1926</p><p><strong>26</strong> Johnny Appleseed's birthday, 1774</p><p><strong>28</strong> Pilgrim's Progress published, 1678; Brigitte Bardot's birthday, 1934; Marcello<br />Mastrolani's birthday, 1924</p><p><strong>29</strong> First course in radio advertising offered at New York City College, 1930</p><p><strong>30</strong> Safety pin invented, 1894</p><h3>OCTOBER</h3><p><strong>1</strong> Alexander the Great defeats Persia, 331 B.C.</p><p><strong>2</strong> Mohandas Gandhi's birthday, 1869</p><p><strong>3</strong> Lincoln proclaims Thanksgiving Day, 1863</p><p><strong>4</strong> St. Francis of Assisi's birthday, 1182; Janis Joplin dies, 1970</p><p><strong>5</strong> Dalton gang killed in bank robbery, 1892</p><p><strong>6</strong> Thor Heyerdahl's birthday, 1914; The Jazz Singer begins the era of<br />"talking" films, 1927</p><p><strong>7</strong> Edgar Allan Poe dies, 1849</p><p><strong>8</strong> Che Guevara killed in Bolivia, 1967</p><p><strong>9</strong> John Lennon's birthday, 1940</p><p><strong>10</strong> The New York Times produces 972-page issue weighing 7-1/2 pounds, 1971</p><p><strong>11</strong> Eleonor Roosevelt's birthday, 1884</p><p><strong>12</strong> Aleister Crowley's birthday, 1875; Dick Gregory's birthday, 1932</p><p><strong>13</strong> Vergil's birthday, 70 B.C.; Lenny Bruce's birthday, 1926</p><p><strong>14</strong> Normans conquer England, 1066; First faster-tha-sound flight, 1947</p><p><strong>16</strong> Oscar Wilde's birthday, 1856; Eugene O'Neill's birthday, 1888</p><p><strong>17</strong> Sterling Moss's birthday, 1929</p><p><strong>18</strong> Chuck Berry's birthday, 1926</p><p><strong>19</strong> Marlon Brando' stage debut, 1944; Peter Max's birthday, 1937</p><p><strong>20</strong> U.S. Navy seizes Monterrey, Mexico, 1842</p><p><strong>21</strong> U.S. Navy restores Monterrey Mexico with apologies ("We thought<br />we were at war!"), 1842</p><p><strong>22</strong> Mercury, Venus, and Uranus in conjunction with the moon.</p><p><strong>23</strong> Sarah Bernhardt's birthday, 1844; Swallows leave Capistrano</p><p><strong>25</strong> Charge of the Light Brigade, 1854</p><p><strong>27</strong> Dylan Thomas's birthday, 1914</p><p><strong>28</strong> Erasmus's birthday, 1466; Return to Standard Time</p><p><strong>29</strong> Sir Walter Raleigh executed in London, 1618; Stock Market<br />collapses, 1929</p><p><strong>30</strong> Grace Slick's birthday, 1939</p>
