                        <h5 id="byline">     BY ANNE AND PAUL EHRLICH    </h5>        <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to      the words "population", "resources", and "environment" in      the late 1960's. (They also coined the term coevolution,      and did a lot to make ecology the household word it is      today.) But while most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs'      popular writing in the areas of ecology and overpopulation      (most of us-for instance-have read Paul's book      The Population Bomb) ... far too few people have any idea      of how deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological      research (research of the type that tends to be published      only in technical journals and college textbooks). That's      why it pleases us to be able to present-on a regular      basis-the following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      THE "INHABER REPORT", PART 2    </h2>    <p>      In our last column, we gave an overview of the "Inhaber      Report" scandal ... an attempt by the Canadian Atomic      Energy Control Board (abetted by various prestigious      journals and scientists) to foist the results of a      hopelessly flawed study upon the public. The      report-entitied Risk of Energy Production (AECB1119)      - written by Herbert Inhaber, purports to show that      solar energy sources are nearly as dangerous to human      beings as are conventional sources (such as coal) ... and      more dangerous than is nuclear energy!    </p>    <p>      Because we know that MOTHER's readers are interested in      alternative energy sources, this column will attempt to      describe-in detail-how biased data selection      was combined with incredible bungling to reach AECB-1119's      preposterous conclusions.    </p>    <h3>      A COMPREHENSIVE COMPARISON?    </h3>    <p>      First, Inhaber claims to have tallied up the direct health      risks-to workers and to the public-brought      about by the construction and operation of conventional and      nonconventional energy sources. He claims to count      accidental deaths and injuries, as well as disease ... and      to include-in his figures-all phases of the      fuel cycle (such as, for example, acquisition of the raw      material to build energy facilities ... the manufacture of      components ... the construction of power plants ... the      mining of fuels ... plant operation and maintenance ... and      the disposition of wastes).    </p>    <p>      This approach (while of some use if carried out      successfully) omits the impact-of the energy sources      in question-upon human well-being ... through      disruptions of climate, of ecosystems,. and of      sociopolitical affairs. Yet such "indirect" damages      (including the loss of agricultural productivity due to      climate disruption by fossil- fuel- produced carbon      dioxide, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons induced      by the spread of nuclear reactors) put far more human lives      in danger than do "direct" accidents and pollution-induced      illness.    </p>    <p>      Even among those environmental risks that he did consider,      Inhaber omitted many important phenomena. Public disease,      for example, appears in the report in only two forms: as      days lost from work-and premature deaths-from      respiratory illness associated with emissions of sulfur      oxides in the presence of particulates ... and as days lost      due to cancer caused by radiation from nuclear power      plants.    </p>    <p>      Inhaber offers no estimate of the disease effects of the      oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, or trace minerals      (mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, etc.) that are emitted      when fossil fuels are burned ... entirely neglects to      mention public disease caused by water pollution from      contamination by the hydrocarbons and the trace metals that      are released during extraction, processing, and      transportation of fossil fuels ... and he ignores all of      the diseases and genetic effects that may appear in future      generations as a result of nuclear-power-produced radiation      or chemical mutagens from fossil fuels.    </p>    <p>      Admittedly, the data needed to make meaningful estimates of      some such effects are simply not available. That's all the      more reason to End fault with the repeated assertions by      Inhaber-and especially by the AECB-that his      analysis is a comprehensive treatment of the accident and      disease risks of energy sources . . . because such      statements, in turn, attempt to justify the report's      sweeping conclusions about which power sources are more      dangerous than which others.    </p>    <h3>      A CONSISTENT COMPARISON?    </h3>    <p>      Actually, most of Inhaber's analysis of public health and      occupational health consequences consists of multiplying      tonnages of materials (say, the amount of steel needed to      build a windmill) by the man-hours-in various      occupational categories - needed to make the      material, fabricate it into the needed components, and      construct a finished energy facility from these parts.      Next, Inhaber multiplies the man-hours in the various      occupational categories by the corresponding rates of      incidence of occupational risk. And if the air pollution      produced per ton of material and the ton-miles of      transportation are known, he adds in estimates of the      public health consequences of these two processes as well.    </p>    <p>      So far, so good? The catch is that, while Inhaber has      indeed applied this method to his analysis of the      nonconventional energy sources and of hydropower-and      while his report and various published summaries lead the      casual reader to believe he used the same approach for      coal, nuclear power, oil, and natural gashe, in fact, has      not counted the risks of creating these conventional      facilities at all ... but only the risks of operating and      maintaining them!    </p>    <p>      Inhaber made a number of less obvious blunders, too. His      data on conventional energy technologies relate to real      commercial systems, in which economic forces have acted to      minimize the amounts of materials and labor used. But the      same estimates for nonconventional energy technologies, on      the other hand, are for preliminary commercial designs, for      experimental systems, or for entirely hypothetical      installations ... in which there has been little or no      economic optimization. Moreover, from the array of data      available, Inhaber has almost invariably chosen examples      that are most demanding of materials and labor ... and many      of these designs will probably never be built commercially,      since they'll be beaten out in the marketplace by the more      frugal designs that the study chooses to ignore (or by      still more thrifty ones not yet invented).    </p>    <h3>     CONCEPTUAL CONFUSIONS AND MISREADINGS    </h3>    <p>      One of the study's most elementary errors is the assumption      that one Btu (or joule or kilocalorie) is the same as any      other (Heat is taken as me equivalent of electricity,      electricity at the power plant is considered to be      equivalent to mechanical energy delivered to the wheels of      an automobile ... and so on.) This error alone is      responsible for inflating Inhaher's estimate of the risks      of methanol production by a factor of between three and      six!    </p>    <p>      However, Inhaber's most important conceptual confusion is      his complete misunderstanding of the storage and backup      requirements of intermittent energy sources such as      sunlight and wind.    </p>    <p>      He provides his solar power plant with enough energy      storage to match or exceed the annual energy output of a      coal-fired or nuclear-powered plant with the same rated      capacity. Because of this particular solar plant's very      large builtin energy storage (the materials and labor      requirements for which Inhaber cheerfully tallies up), the      installation is more than a match for the conventional      baseload plant it replaces. Yet Inhaber irrationally      charges the solar plant with an additional megawatt-year of      coal "backup" for every Eve megawatt-years of      solar-generated electricity it produces. Such unnecessary      backup systems account for 65-85% of his upper limit risk      estimates for wind, photovoltaic, and solarthermal-electric      technologies.    </p>    <p>      Other conceptual errors in AECB-1119 include: adding      together occupational and public risks (which should not be      combined because-among other reasons-the public      risks are largely involuntary, while the bearers of      occupational risks often have made a conscious choice to      accept the hazards in exchange for the wages and other      benefits of their jobs) ... ascribing the same number of      "days lost" to premature death from aggravated respiratory      disease as to death from cancer (which is incorrect because      the former disease usually takes weeks or months off its      victims' lives, while the latter-on the      average-cuts a lifespan by many years) ... and      inflating the risks of coal-as compared to nuclear powerby      assuming mining conditions and pollution control practices      that are out of date and now illegal.    </p>    <p>      Inhaber's 50-fold misreading of a windplant's material      requirements was discussed in our previous column. In      connection with ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), he      understates-by more than twice -the generating      capacity of the unit whose material requirements he      tabulates, while overstating the construction labor      requirements by 10 to 50 times!    </p>    <p>      The report's author also claims to have used the highest      available nuclear accident risk values, in order not to be      accused of pronuclear bias. Actually, Inhaber's "upper      limit" estimate of nuclear accident risk is from two to      several hundred times lower than those given in three of      the four references on reactor safety he cites. He also      implies that he has included estimates of the risk of      radioactive-waste management ... but he hasn't.    </p>    <h3>      IRRATIONAL CALCULATIONS    </h3>    <p>      Inhaber's assessment of the risks involved in constructing      a methanol factory are scaled from figures for an oil      refinery, and are for operation and maintenance, rather      than for construction. His material and labor requirements      for obtaining natural gas (figures that he never actually      translates into risks, as noted above) come from data for      fuel-oil and coal-gasification facilities.    </p>    <p>      To obtain material requirements for energy storage at a      solar-thermal-eleetric plant, he subtracts the weight of a      hypothetical plant with no storage from the weight (as      given in a later report from the same project) of a similar      plant that includes storage. Since the difference in the      quoted weights was caused by the correction of earlier      errors and changes in assumptions-as well as by the      addition of a storage unit- the procedure is useless.      Yet, this same storage system size was then used for      Inhaber's calculations for photovoltaic and windpower      plants as well ... even though, as a heat storage system,      it's completely irrelevant to those technologies.    </p>    <p>      Because the study considers energy sources in Canada,      Inhaber scales up the size of his solarthermal- electric      power plant by 32% ... to account for Canada's having 32%      less sunlight than the southwestern U.S., the area for      which the plant was designed. In reality, only the size of      the collector needs to be increased to enable such a plant      to produce the same amount of energy as it could in      America's Southwest ... but Inhaber has increased the size      of the boiler, the generator, and even the coal backup      system by the same factor.    </p>    <p>      He inflates the material requirements for the production of      photovoltaic cells by a bizarre procedure that depends on      rejecting a number that's easily seen to be correct and      cobbling up a "correction" factor ... which is based, in      part, on a misunderstanding of the difference between the      peak and average output of solar cells.    </p>    <p>      Then, to build up his estimate of risk per unit of energy,      Inhaber combines some of the highest figures for the      material requirements of renewable energy systems with some      of the lowest system performance figures available. His      risk estimates are inflated still further by the false      assumption that people in the most dangerous occupations      (e.g., roofing and sheet metal) perform most of the work on      renewable energy installations.    </p>    <p>      In a similar scam, Inhaber uses material requirements for      an unconventional power plant from a respectable reference,      but ignores that reference's figure for the plant's annual      output in favor of lower figures found elsewhere. In one      example, he takes his material requirements-for      windplants-from the Project Independence report, but      ignores that study's annual load factor of 0.34 (34      megawatt-years of annual output for each 100 megawatts of      rated capacity) in favor of the figure of 0.06. (This lower      load factor has the effect, of course, of increasing the      materials needed per megawatt-year of output.)    </p>    <h3>      UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSUMPTONS    </h3>    <p>      The study also makes the unwarranted assumption that      facilities producing methanol from biomass will wear out in      20 years, while oil refineries will last three decades This      sort of faulty figuring inflates the construction risk of      biomass by 50%. Inhaber also assumes that such a plant will      be twice as big as an oil refinery per unit of energy      output ... ostensibly because methanol contains about half      as much energy per pound as does gasoline. This twofold      increase in methanol's construction risk is unwarranted,      for methanol's simpler technology probably would result in      a plant that's smaller per unit of energy output than is a      complex gasoline refinery.    </p>    <p>      Inhaber also assumes that all the materials used to      construct unconventional energy facilities-including      rock for energy storage and sand and gravel to make      concrete-must be hauled 300 miles ... the average      transport range for coal used in power production. This      assumption leads to a large risk associated with      transportation accidents, when-in reality-such      common materials must travel only a few dozen miles.    </p>    <p>      To estimate the maintenance risk of rooftop solar heating      systems, Inhaber starts with a very generous estimate of      the time he thinks professional roofers would need for the      job, and computes their injury rate for this number of      hours. Then he multiplies this risk by four ... assuming      that homeowners who maintain their own collectors will take      twice as long to do the work and will fall off the roof      twice as often per hour!    </p>    <h3>      COVERING THE TRIAL    </h3>    <p>      How could such an array of mistakes have escaped the notice      of the reviewers of the articles in which Inhaber      summarized his own "results" for Science, New Scientist,      and Energy? Part of the answer is that none of Inhaber's      detailed calculations-and few of his      assumptions-were included in the articles he      submitted for publication. The bodies were all buried in      the report's appendices, and further concealed under layers      of arithmetic mistakes and typographical errors To unravel      the chain of fallacies that led to the conclusions amounted      to a major undertaking ... even for an expert at risk      assessment like our colleague, John Holdren (whose group is      responsible for the critique reported here).    </p>    <p>      One of the ironies of the Inhaber fiasco is that Science      magazine, whose February 1979 article by Inhaber gave his      conclusions their widest circulation, had      published-only eight months earlieran editorial      entitled "Bad Science and Social Penalties" by Cyril Comar      (a nuclear advocate from the Electric Power Research      Institute), which contains a description of "bad science"      that fits AECB-1119 like a glove. Comar was also remarkably      prescient in predicting the kind of public response      Inhaber's work has received: "Bad science, being more      newsworthy, will tend to be publicized and seized on by      some to support their convictions."    </p>    <p>      We are in complete agreement with Comar's prescription for      dealing with the general problem: "Perhaps the best      solution lies in greatly increased efforts of individual      scientists ... to vigorously take the initiative and      responsibility, to immediately expose bad science whenever      it occurs, and thereby to reestablish credibility.    </p>    <p>      The Inhaber report is available from the Atomic Energy      Control Board, P.O.
