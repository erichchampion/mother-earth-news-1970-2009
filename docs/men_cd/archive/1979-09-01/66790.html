                <p>      With "cold days a' comin'", we thought you'd like to know      how to use MOTHER's Wood-Burner (or any wood stove) to...    </p>            <p>      Well, although the evenings may still be warm enough to      lure an occasional firefly into flashin', we all know that      cold weather won't be long in comin'.    </p>    <p>      And most of us are also pretty danged certain that the      winter of 1979/1980 will be marked with more energy      problems-such as high heating fuel prices (and      limited availability), power outages, and so      forth-than any cold season in recent memory.    </p>    <p>      That very strong possibility means that owning some sort of      wood-burning stove-even if the appliance is only to      be used as backup for your regular heating and cooking      systems-makes better sense than ever!    </p>    <p>      So if you're one of those folks who don't have a      "timber-powered" heater, you should know that there's still      time to build yourself a "$500 wood stove" (for less than      $41!) using MOTHER'S plans. And, for those men and women      who already own a wood-burning wonder, we'd like to share a      way to use your stove-while it's heating your      home-to cook up a hearty and nutritious dinner.    </p>    <h3>      IN THE GRAND TRADITION    </h3>    <p>      In most country kitchens of the not-so-distant past (in the      United States and many other nations as well), the      "pot-au-feu"-a long-simmered, savory kettleful. of      good foods-occupied a prominent position on "the back      burner" of the family cookstove.    </p>    <p>      The traditional soup could be made with any of an almost      infinite number of recipes, or it might be simply a tasty      combination of leftovers. But-regardless of the      fixin's used-the slow-simmer cooking method resulted      in an overall blend of flavor . . . yet still allowed the      individual taste of each separate ingredient to "shine on      through".    </p>    <p>      Why not take advantage of the chilly days ahead ( and of      your home-warming wood stove) to try out some simmered-soup      recipes of your own? The innards-soothing minestrone      "formula" that follows should serve to get you started.    </p>    <h3>      MAKE A MARVELOUS MINESTRONE    </h3>    <p>      Start your soup by preparing (or removing from your      freezer) 2 quarts of stock: either beef or hearty      vegetable.    </p>    <p>      Now fry 2 thinly sliced onions-along with 1/2 clove      of garlic-in I/4 cup of olive (or other vegetable) oil      until the onion turns yellow and translucent. (You can save      yourself some pot-washing if you saut√© the      ingredients right in your soup kettle.)    </p>    <p>      Once the onions are ready, add 2 cups of chopped spinach, 2      cups of "slawed" cabbage, and 3 or 4 chopped carrots.      Simmer the vegetables-over low heat-for about 5 minutes . .      . adding more oil if necessary and taking care that the      ingredients don't get too brown.    </p>    <p>      Then add 1 can of tomatoes (the can size will depend upon      how "tomato-y" you want your soup to be), a couple of      dashes of sage, 1 teaspoon of dried parsley, 1 cup of      cooked kidney beans, 1 cup of cooked peas, and salt and      pepper to taste. Stir the soup well, add 1/2 cup of      uncooked rice, and mix in the previously prepared soup      stock.    </p>    <p>      Let the pot simmer for at least 2 hours-adding more      stock (or water or tomato Juice) if the soup begins to get      too thick for your taste-and serve the      cold-weather treat with a topping of grated Parmesan      cheese.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you don't already own one of MOTHER's      WoodBurners-and would like to build one-the      detailed, step-by-step plans are available for $10 postpaid      from Mother's Plans, WoodBurner,.
