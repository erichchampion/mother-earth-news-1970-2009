        <p> If you depend upon electrical energy to run your house or farm, you can't afford to be caught by a power brownout or blackout. Though America's utilities supply us with an amazingly reliable source of current-with an average of only 24 hours of outage every 10 years, per family-power failures <em>do</em> (and will) happen.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" rel="nofollow" name="article">Furthermore, a loss of electricityeven from natural causes such as hurricanes or blizzards (and the seasons that spawn such phenomena are nearly upon us)-can leave you with a basement full of water or no heat. And the average damage costs from such natural (or unnatural) disasters might be much higher than you imagine ... often well over $2,000 (for the repair of damages caused by frozen pipes, for example). Worse yet, when the power <em>does</em> go out, you're totally helpless to remedy the situation . . . unless-of course-you happen to have an auxiliary generator.</a></p><p>It's true! You don't <em>have</em> to be completely dependent on those wires strung from the pole out front. For a pretty reasonable price-especially if you consider your potential losses-you can put yourself back "on line" with an emergency electrical supply. (Better yet, you canby simply opening the main jet-run on renewable alcohol fuel.)</p><p>So just consult the following list that shows average electrical consumption for various tools and appliances, [2] add up the wattage of those you might want to supply, and [3] remembering that one kilowatt equals 1,000 watts, consult the output column in the accompanying specification chart (which, though not allinclusive, does contain a good sampling of the better units available) to choose a generator that suits your needs and budget.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
