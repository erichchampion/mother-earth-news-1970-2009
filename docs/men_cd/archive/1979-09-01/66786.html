    <p>
                    <p>      Now you can make jams and jellies with whatever      kind-and amount-of sweetener you want!    </p>        <p>      "I am fascinated by this pectin. I wish I could call in ail      my books and change all the recipes for jellies so that      they could be made with this product and much less sugar."    </p>    <p>       Euell Gibbons    </p>    <p>      Ol' Euell wrote the above remark after his diabetic brother      Joe showed the master forager how to make all the jams and      jellies he wanted . . . without using sugar! Euell was      excited by his sibling's discovery because it meant his own      toast coverings could now be both more healthful      (especially when you consider that, odd as it sounds, a      tablespoonful of ordinary jelly contains more sugar than      does a tablespoonful of dry sugar!) and tastier. ('The wild      foods expert had "long deplored the necessity of drowning      delicate wild flavors in great overloads of sugar".)    </p>    <p>      And what is this gelling agent . . . a substance so amazing      that MOTHER'S jam-making staffers have nicknamed it the      Magic Pectin? Well, its "real" name-unpretentiously      enough-is Low Methoxyl Pectin, and it's an absolutely      harmless cooking ingredient that's made from the inner      peels of citrus fruits (instead of-vegetarians please      note-from animal products as are ordinary commercial      pectins). And, better yet, L.M. gels with the aid of small      amounts of calcium . . . rather than large quantities of      sugar.    </p>    <p>      Not only that, but Magic Pectin is also unbelievably easy      to use. Just take a look at the "new" jellymaking      technique.    </p>    <p>      Step 1. Prepare two separate water solutions: one made with      four tablespoons of pectin per quart of liquid, and the      other using one-half teaspoon of calcium (we use the      healthful organic mineral, dicalcium phosphate) per cup of      water. This is actually the most difficult step of the      entire operation, because neither substance dissolves all      that easily. You'll probably have to use a blender and dump      each agent into a batch of swirling water. However, you can      mix the solutions in quantity and keep 'em stored in your      fridge. (Magic Pectin and water will gel in the icebox but      still be perfectly "fit" for use. The calcium mix, though,      settles out a bit in storage and will need some further      blending before it's used.)    </p>    <p>      Step 2. Clean and prepare your fruit as you would for any      jam- or jellymaking operation.    </p>    <p>      Step 3. Sterilize your jars and lids.    </p>    <p>      Step 4. Heat your fruit or juice in a large saucepan and      add honey, artificial sweetener, or sugar to taste.      (MOTHER'S "jammers" regularly use one tablespoon of      honey-instead of the standard one cup of      sugar-with each cup of fruit or juice . . . but you      don't have to use any sweetener at all!)    </p>    <p>      Step 5. When this mixture reaches a gentle boil (no      lengthy, ester-destroying stewing needed here), stir in one      part of L.M. solution to every four parts of fruit. Then      just bring the mixture back to bubbling and mix in one      teaspoonful of the calcium liquid per cup of fruit.    </p>    <p>      Step 6. Your jam is done. All you have to do now is jar and      seal the delicacy. (NOTE: Because the spread does not      contain large amounts of sugar-which acts as a      preservative as well as a sweetener-you should not      paraffin-seal these products. Use a normal hot-pack      procedure-inverting the filled jars for a 20-minute      cooling period after sealing-or process the filled      containers for 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath.)    </p>    <p>      Now, that's easy! No tedious cookin' down of your fixin's,      and no testing spoonfuls of jelly until the instant your      treat finally "sheets". What's more, if your batch-or      a sample cooled in the fridge-doesn't gel quite hard      enough the first time, simply reheat and "firm it up" with      a bit more calcium mix (and make a note for your next      spread-cooking occasion).    </p>    <p>      And boy, does Magic Pectin work! One of MOTHER'S helpers      has made the "strawberriest" (instead of "sugariest") jam      you could ever eat . . . another staffer has concocted      jelly out of everything from delicate elderberry flowers to      sassafras roots. Why, of Euell even created a "magic      pectin" frozen-orange-juice jelly!    </p>    <p>      The wonder getter is affordable, to boot. In fact, Walnut      Acres-the only retail distributor of Magic      Pectin-has decided to give MOTHER'S readers an      exclusive, onetime introductory offer.    </p>    <p>      Here's the good-until-1980 deal: Eight ounces of L.M.      pectin (enough for four dozen pints of jelly!) along with      the required one ounce of dicalcium phosphate costs you      only $6.00, while a one-pound/ two-ounce pair of packets of      the jammakers is a mere $9.00 (these charges include      shipping and handling). To take advantage of the special      prices, send your order and check to Walnut Acres, Dept.      TMEN, Penns Creek, Pennsylvania 17862.    </p>    <p>      Folks, we know it's late in the growing season, but earlier      this summer-because of a lemon freeze in      California-Walnut Acres was plumb out of the precious      pectin. MOTHER came to the Pennsylvania health food store's      rescue by helping it track down a new supplier, so the      folks there are now very kindly returning the favor by      offering you their products at economical "pre-freeze"      rates.    </p>    <p>      Besides, there's plenty of good jamming time left (try      using elderberries, grapes, quinces, apples, and plums, for      instance) ... so don't wait. Try this amazing pectin now      and-come next season-you won't use anything      else!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Euell and Joe Gibbons first announced this      discovery to the world in their fascinating and informative      book, Feast on a Diabetic Diet ($3.95, David McKay      Company), available through your local bookstore orfor the      listed price plus 95 cents shipping and handling-from      Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.
