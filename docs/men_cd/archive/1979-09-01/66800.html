            <p id="caption">      Issue # 59 - September/October 1979    </p>                <p>      People have been keeping dog and cat companions ever since      humankind began to domesticate animals, and most folks feel      that sharing life with at least one of the furry housemates      is an educational and pleasurable experience.      Unfortunately, though, such four-legged family members do      get sick now and then. In fact, it sometimes seems that a      household's animals require more care and attention than do      its humans!    </p>    <p>      You can, however, save a considerable amount of time,      effort, worry, and money . . . by treating many pet      illnesses yourself. And-in this article-I'll      describe some basic veterinary techniques that'll help you      administer oral and injected medication to both dogs and      cats. But first let me give you a few important words of      warning:    </p>    <p>      [1] Consult with your vet to find out what medicine you      should be giving your pets ( this piece will tell you "how      to" but not "what to" ).    </p>    <p>      [2] Be careful about what you're doing. Know the proper      techniques for cleaning and filling a syringe (as described      in my article, "You Can Too Give That Animal an Injection"      in MOTHER NO. 53, page 92). Read medicine labels several      times to be sure you're using the proper amounts. And be      painstaking in your efforts to apply those physics      properly.    </p>    <p>      [3] Don't become frustrated if Kitty keeps spitting out the      pill or Rover squirms free just when you finally get the      needle ready. Patience is an often necessary virtue for any      animal healer to develop.    </p>    <h3>      ORAL DOG MEDICATIONS    </h3>    <p>      The easiest way to give oral medications to your canine, of      course, is to take advantage of the beast's gluttonous      nature. Simply hide the powdered or capsuled remedy in your      pup's favorite treat and let the "patient" gulp it down.    </p>    <p>      However, some particular medications-as the labels      (which you should ALWAYS read . . . more than once) will      tell you-shouldn't be given along with food. Furthermore, a      few canines are such picky eaters that they'll find the      tiny pill in the middle of that tasty hunk of hamburger and      "spittoon" it right out onto the floor.    </p>    <p>      You can force-feed pills to a reluctant dog by grasping      both sides of the animal's upper muzzle with one hand, and      pressing the beast's lips against its upper teeth. This      "squeeze play" will force the pet to open its mouth enough      for you to pop a pill over its tongue. Larger capsules      (called "boluses") can be lubricated-for easier      internal travel-with a little butter or mineral oil.      But no matter what size the pill is, place it well back in      the dog's mouth (think in terms of tickling the beast's      tonsils). Then close your critter's jaws and hold 'em shut      (and slightly elevated) until the animal finally swallows.      You may also need to stroke Fido's neck-or even      gently blow in his nose-to encourage the gulping reflex.    </p>    <p>      Liquid medications are usually easier o to administer.      Simply pull the dog's lower lip out on one side (near the      back of the jaw . . . where it meets the upper lip) m to      form a cup, pour the elixir into this "pinched pouch", and      then tip the s hound's head slightly upward.    </p>    <h3>      CANINE INJECTIONS    </h3>    <p>      Sometimes even our best efforts to help will give a pet      some temporary pain . . . and dogs often react      instinctively to such discomfort by attacking the cause of      the hurt with their teeth. Well-when you're giving      your pet an injection-that "cause" will be your      fragile hand! So, for your own health, you may want to      protect yourself in advance from any "snappy" reflexes.    </p>    <p>      One way to avoid getting chomped during your pet's      treatment is to have a helper run one arm under the dog's      neck and trap the animal's head in the crook of that limb.      The assistant can then wrap his or her other arm around the      dog's body to keep the animal from backing out of the      restraining grip.    </p>    <p>      The best way to protect yourself from an irritated pooch,      though, is to put a muzzle on the critter. You can make      such a jaw vise out of leather thongs, 1-to 2-inch gauze,      or any other cordlike material. Simply loop the "ribbon"      under the dog's lower jaw and over its snout, tie an      overhand knot, run the wrap back under the animal's mouth,      and make another overhand hitch. Then bind the ends of the      homemade muzzle by tying a bow behind the dog's ears.    </p>    <p>      Once both your pet and your equipment are ready, it's time      to administer the medication. The two most common      injections are subcutaneous (under the skin) and      intramuscular (into a muscle) shots. Neither one of these      "needles" is particularly difficult to administer . . .      just be sure that you're giving the right type of shot for      the medicine you're using! (By the way, tricky intravenous      and intraperitoneal injections are almost always best left      to the vet.)    </p>    <p>      Subcutaneous (Sub-Q) injections are given along the middle      of the dog's back . . . in the loose fold of skin over its      shoulders. Just clean this section of hide . . . pinch and      lift the "flap" . . . push your 20- to 22-gauge, 1-1/2-inch      needle into the pocket formed by the skin . . . point it      toward the dog . . . and inject.    </p>    <p>      Intramuscular (IM.) shots are a bit more difficult to      administer. The best spot for an LM. injection is in the      rear third of the dog's thigh . . . a safe distance away      from the large sciatic nerve that runs down the middle of      the leg. Cleanse this area and thrust in the needle (use a      20- to 22-gauge, 1- to 1-1/2-inch point on Lassie-sized      canines and a 23- to 25-gauge, 3/4- to 1-inch "poker" on      smaller dogs). Next draw back briefly ("aspirate") on the      syringe to see if blood comes into your injector. If so,      you've hit a vein or artery and should start over and      "look" elsewhere for your medication site.    </p>    <h3>      ORAL MEDICATIONS FOR CATS    </h3>    <p>      Felines present their own special brand of problems to the      homestead animal healer. An angry tabby can swat with its      sharp front claws, bite with its razor-edged teeth, and      throw its powerful hind legs into the fray. Besides all of      that, cats will often react more violently to your efforts      at restraint than they will to whatever pain your treatment      may inflict.    </p>    <p>      Because of a feline's defenses (and defensiveness), the      best cat restraint technique is often no restraint at all.      You can (at times) give medicines, and even some      injections, to a tabby-with no problems at      all-if the critter is being held in the arms of its      favorite human.    </p>    <p>      Another good cat-handling tactic is to hold your pet off      the ground by lifting on the large fold of skin directly      behind the animal's head. This tranquilizing grip will      subdue most any feline ( probably because the cat's mother      used to haul the animal by the same spot back during its      "kitty" days).    </p>    <p>      Since most cats are too fussy to fall for the      pill-in-the-food trick, this scruffgrabbing maneuver is a      good way to give Tabby her capsuled medications. First,      grab enough skin so that-when you tilt the critter's      head backward-its mouth will be forced open. Next,      plop a lubricated capsule onto the back of the cat's tongue      (this will be easier to accomplish if you use long-handled      tweezers or push the medicine back toward the throat with      the eraser end of a pencil). And then close the critter's      mouth and keep its head tilted upward until the animal      swallows. (Give the feline its liquid doses of medicine      with the same pour-the-juice-in-the-cheek technique you use      with dogs.)    </p>    <p>      If your cat absolutely refuses to take its oral medicine      without a fight, you'll have to use more serious restraint      measures. It's hard to muzzle such a short-snouted beast .      . . so try, instead, having one person hold the animal by      the scruff of the neck while another holds its feet. If the      unruly feline is still unmanageable, you can wrap the cat's      whole body in a heavy cloth towel or canvas bag . . .      leaving only its head exposed.    </p>    <h3>      FELINE NEEDLES    </h3>    <p>      The locations and techniques for subcutaneous and      intramuscular feline injections are about the same as those      for dogs: Sub-Q shots are given in the fold of skin over      the animal's shoulders, and I.M. injections are delivered      to the rear third of the thigh muscle (use a 23- to      25-gauge, 3/4- to 1-inch needle). "Under the skin" shots      are relatively painless, so they can often be      given-quickly-while the cat is relaxed or is      diverted by its favorite food.    </p>    <h3>      TAKE CARE    </h3>    <p>      There's no closer human-animal relationship than that      between folks and their family dogs and cats. And you      can-with the skills presented in this article and      some patience-give at least as much healing help to      these animals as you give to the two-legged members of your      household.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S.

If you're dealing with a ""short-snouted"" mutt, though, have someone hold the dog's head in the crook of his or her arm, and cradle the canine's body with the other arm.
