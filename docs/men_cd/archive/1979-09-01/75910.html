                <p>      In Issue No. 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of mankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced      our still. standing offer: Anyone (and that means you!) who      sends us a short (200 words or less) account of an actual      barter that's good enough to print will receive-as      the folks on the following page have-a twelve-month      subscription (or extension of same) to THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS(restricted).<br />    </p>        <p>      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), INC., P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville,N.C. 28739.    </p>    <p>      I live in Uganik Bay, on the northwest side of Kodiak      Island. It's a raw but awesome land, where life is      controlled by the tides and by the sun's position in the      sky. Although we're only about 60 miles from town, the      settlement is pretty inaccessible . . . there are no roads      to this part of the island, and the only way to reach our      home is by float plane or boat.    </p>    <p>      In the summer, the bay-30 miles long and 10 miles      across at the mouth-is alive and ,jumping as tenders,      seiners, fishermen, and cannery workers follow the salmon      runs. But when the salmon are far upstream and the leaves      begin to turn, the population dwindles to about a dozen      households ... which support themselves by hunting and      trapping, and consuming whatever larder they have stored up      during the summer months.    </p>    <p>      In this remote corner of Alaska, the barter system is a way      of life. It is not uncommon for neighboring fish camps to      trade groceries-fresh venison for eggs and produce      from town, or garden goods for store-bought ones-and      it's a much-practiced custom for neighbors to trade work.      For example, help on the repair of a skiff will bring aid      in cutting a firewood supply. Books-and other scarce      reading materials-make the circuit year round, as does      children's clothing. The lack of currency (not to mention      places to spend it!) makes this swapping necessary as well      as convenient.    </p>    <p>      Our most unusual and successful barter involved the      services of a bush pilot. As debts for plane rides in the      busy summer months piled up, we began to look for an      alternative mode of payment to our friend. He was delighted      when we offered a cross-fox fur from this winter's catch,      and when the snows came we were just as delighted to      fulfill our part of the bargain. Now we try to trade our      winter's harvest for needed goods or services whenever      possible.    </p>    <p>      By the way, MOTHER, I hear on the radio that there is now a      statewide organization that encourages Alaskans to use the      barter system. I hope it is as successful as our trades      have been!    </p>    <p>      T.F.<br />      Alaska    </p>    <p>      Along the upper Columbia River, where stores are often few      and far between, barter is more a necessity than an art.      One of my favorite swaps involved a young heifer. She was a      silly half-wild Charolais and Hereford cross . . . with no      respect for fences and an eager eye for that elusive      "greener grass".    </p>    <p>      Shortly after we got her, the beast decided to head for our      neighbor's field. She proved skittish when we tried to      round her up, and (after two days of chasing after her) we      decided to "bring the mountain to Mahomet". Our friends      next door swapped us a tape deck and a rifle, and the      heifer was theirs. Easier said than done, though . . . in      short order she was through the fence and back to our      place.    </p>    <p>      Since it seemed easier to trade her than to return her,      that durn fool calf was swapped back and forth three times      in the next six months. Strangely enough, every trade left      two satisfied barterers . . . one rid of a "silly, breachy      heifer" and the other in possession of a "fine beef cow"!    </p>    <p>      B.F.<br />      Washington    </p>    <p>      My favorite swap took place back In 1967, when my family      and I had a farm in Perry, Michigan. A friend (who was      "bucks up" at the time) invited me along on a visit to a      Hong Kong tailor who was holding an open house in nearby      Lansing. My friend intended to place an order, while      I-though curious-was broke.    </p>    <p>      Well, we traveled into town . . . looked at the goods      (fantastic fabrics!) . . . and my buddy decided on several      garments. After the tailor had taken the necessary      measurements and the financial arrangements were made, the      tape-wielder asked me if I wanted a suit. I sure did, I      replied, but I couldn't afford his prices. Just then a      thought struck me! I had a pair of Sicilian burros that I'd      been trying to sell (unsuccessfully) for several months.      How, I proposed, about a deal    </p>    <p>      The tailor's face actually lit up! He said that he'd always      wanted to swap something, but that I was the first customer      who'd ever asked. Well, before long I was all measured up      for a custommade silk suit, and off we went. The next      morning the Hong Kong representative pulled up to the farm      in a Lincoln Continental with a U-Haul trailer in tow. We      loaded the burros, and he headed off for Arizona with a      gift for his grandchildren that I'll bet they never forgot.      Three weeks later I received the suit . . . along with an      invoice marked "Paid in Full . . . Amount: Two Burros". Now      there's an outstanding swap if I've ever made one!    </p>    <p>      D.C.<br />      Michigan    </p>    <p>      One of the most important events-both social and      financial-for back-to-the-landers is the farm      auction. Such shindigs offer the newcomer a chance to make      friends, pick up a lot of good information,      and-perhaps-even snag a bargain or two!    </p>    <p>      After attending several country bid ups, though, we began      to realize something. All too often, the reason for the      sale turned out to be that the farmer in question had gone      broke . . . and, just as often, the cause of the financial      disaster was overinvestment in expensive (and seldom used)      equipment. So when we bought our 60 acres in the country,      we decided to avoid owning machinery as much as possible.    </p>    <p>      For the first years-while we were getting to know the      neighbors and learning about farm life-we simply paid      for work that required expensive equipment . . . and even      that cost less than actually buying the necessary machines.      For the past several years, though, we've been able to swap      our time for the use of our neighbor's farming tools. We      gladly spend several days helping a fellow agrarian do his      work, knowing that-in return-we'll do much the      same work at home using the same equipment . . . his! Our      assistance has become as indispensable to him as his      tractors and implements are to us . . . because we all save      money, and enjoy a strong sense of community in the      bargain.    </p>    <p>      We also barter for homebaked bread (and fresh milk and      eggs) . . . it sure beats paying high prices plus sales tax      for stale supermarket produce.    </p>    <p>      J.V.<br />      Colorado    </p>    <p>      My husband Tom and I (we're Peace Corps volunteers working      with a Gardens and Nutrition program in the rural highlands      of Guatemala) came across what we think is a pretty good      international swap.    </p>    <p>      A Guatemalan friend of ours (the proprietor of the local      hardware store) owns a couple of acres planted in young      apple trees. The land also sports a four-room house with      tile roof and floors (a lovely place to laze in a hammock      and watch the rain wash the pine-covered slopes) and a huge      barn. One can pick apples, peaches, and pears from the      porch of the house. There are lush roses, fuschias,      hibiscus, poinsettias, and citrus trees, plus a chorus of      exotic birds. The spread also includes plenty of land      suitable for gardening and raising lots of chickens and      rabbits.    </p>    <p>      All this is ours . . . rent-free! Don Haroldo asked us to      live in this little paradise, without cost, and all he      wanted in return was for us to keep an eye on his apple      trees. We love our "new" house so much that we've      volunteered to paint and plaster the building, dig a      latrine, develop the existing wells, and generally clean      and fix the place up. Our patron is happy to provide all      the materials we need for the task.    </p>    <p>      In addition, our trading partner is interested in working      with us on projects such as MOTHER's Hydraulic Ram Pump      (Issue No. 87, page 120), which he wants to build so he can      irrigate his apple trees from the stream during the dry      season.    </p>    <p>      We may be a long way from home here in our "mini-Eden", but      we've discovered that the age-old practice of barter is not      bounded by borders or language.    </p>    <p>      A.K.<br />      Chichicastenago, Guatemala    </p>
