                        <p>      <em>In 1976, Tom Ferguson</em> - <em>then a      fourth-year medical student at Yale</em> -      <em>launched a magazine called</em> Medical Self-Care ...      <em>which</em> - <em>he hoped</em> - <em>would      serve as "a</em> Whole Earth Catalog <em>of the best      medical books, tools, and resources".</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Tom spoke of his plans for the publication</em> -      <em>and of his conviction that self-care could raise the      general level of health in this country and</em> lower      <em>our inflated levels of medical spending</em> -      <em>in the Plowboy interview in MOTHER NO. 51 ... and left      no doubt that he would work toward making those "dreams"      come true.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Well, Tom Ferguson</em> is Doctor <em>Ferguson now, and      the medical self-care "movement"</em> - <em>as well      as Tom's magazine</em> - <em>has flourished.      People</em> are <em>beginning to assume more responsibility      for their own well-being and are eager for information that      will help them take better care of their bodies.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So</em> - <em>to continue to provide just such      very necessary data</em> - <em>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      (restricted) is going to offer as a regular feature a piece by Tom      Ferguson, M.D., called (what else?) "Medical      Self-Care".</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Back in my early days on the hospital wards, I was shocked      by the numbers of people who were suffering <em>(and</em>      dying!) from <em>preventable</em> diseases. I felt that our      culture-by not <em>teaching</em> things like      relaxation, exercise, diet, and so forth-had let      those men and women down ... and would continue to let down      generation after generation of children, unless our      youngsters could be <em>taught</em> to take care of their      bodies.    </p>    <p>      So, when I later had the opportunity to devote several      months to an M.D. thesis project, I decided to set up a      "good example" class to teach medical skills to first      graders. The regular instructors in my "target" school were      enthusiastic about the program, and soon three coworkers      and I had arranged to work with eight children-for      two afternoons each week-over a two-month period.    </p>    <p>      The teachers suggested that we explore areas that the      children <em>wanted</em> to learn about, rather than coming      in with a prepackaged set of goals. So we opened up the      session with this loose definition of the class: "This is a      time for you to find out about your bodies, about doctors,      about what happens when you get sick, and about <em>how to      stay healthy.</em> Your 'job' is to think up good questions      about health. <em>Our</em> job is to answer whatever      questions we can, and help you figure out how to find your      <em>own</em> answers to the others.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT, ME TEACH MEDICINE?    </h3>    <p>      My co-workers and I were all a little uncertain about our      ability to instruct the children in even      <em>rudimentary</em> medical skills. One of the myths in      our culture is that medical information is so specialized      that a little of such knowledge can be terribly dangerous      ... and that it's best to leave <em>all</em> the      responsibility for "doctoring" to the experts.    </p>    <p>      In the course of our classroom experiment, however, we      discovered that It's <em>all right</em> for people to get      together to talk about illnesses and bodies ... even if no      one in the gathering is a "pro". You see, one of the most      important medical selfcare skills is the ability to pose      the right question and then figure out how to <em>find</em>      the answer.    </p>    <p>      We emphasized this sort of self-sufficiency in our classes      ... by helping the young students use the library to      resolve some of their questions, and take advantage of the      other resources that we had available to answer others.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT THEY WANTED TO KNOW    </h3>    <p>      As often as not, our class's questions would lead us into      areas of the children's personal fears and concerns. "When      my sister had appendicitis, the doctor measured the white      cells in her blood, " one of our students told us. "What      did he do that for?" We had to respond to such questions      both by providing the technical information sought      <em>and</em> by easing the unexpressed concern behind the      queries ... which was often, "Could the same thing happen      to <em>me? "</em>    </p>    <h3>      ORGANIZED GROUP ACTIVITIES    </h3>    <p>      The children were especially interested in "hands on"      activities, and we presented a number of opportunities for      them to actually feel, see, and listen to the workings of      their bodies. All of our students learned how to take their      own pulse readings, for example (we found that the      under-the-angle-of-the-jaw carotid pulse was easiest for      children to locate). The youngsters also came to understand      the <em>significance</em> of such measurements ... by      noting the difference in pulse rates before and after a      fast run, and that experiment led to a discussion of how      physical fitness affects pulse rate: People in better      physical condition have stronger hearts and <em>slower</em>      pulses, for example.    </p>    <p>      Since it became apparent early in the class that one      stethoscope and eight youngsters would add up to chaos, we      obtained an inexpensive "stetho" (at a cost of $2.00 to      $5.00) for each of our students. Many good questions and      discussions resulted from letting the children try to find      different sounds with the tools. (They discovered noises      that we <em>teachers</em> had never thought of ... like "my      toes wiggling in my shoes" and "my hair".)    </p>    <h3>      QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS    </h3>    <p>      Our class discussions often related to the children's      concern and sense of helplessness about what actually goes      on at the doctor's office or the hospital. We were asked      such things as: "What happens when they give you gas in an      operation? " and "What happens when an animal dies?"      (Questions about sex and death seemed easier for them if      discussed in terms of animals.)    </p>    <p>      In responding to the children's worries, we tried to help      the youngsters explore the feelings that such questions      expressed ... although it was hard for us to remember that      our students often didn't <em>want</em> specifically      correct information so much as a chance to share deeply      felt concerns.    </p>    <h3>      FIELD TRIPS AND PROJECTS    </h3>    <p>      Our schedule limited us to one field trip I though I'd      suggest that anyone else conducting such a "special health      class" take more excursions ... perhaps to a newborn      nursery, a children's ward, or a pediatrician's office).      Our group was offered a choice for their one outing, how      ever, and made what turned out to be an excellent decision:      They chose to visit an animal hospital. We got a tour of      the operating room, a description of common surgical      procedures, and-the real hit of the day-a      demonstration of dog and cat X-rays. The latter fascinated      the children <em>(and</em> helped them understand how their      <em>own</em> "insides" work) ... we had to just about drag      them away.    </p>    <p>      Independent (but supervised) student projects-such as      finding out what different bones look like, or how to use a      microscope-also proved to be worthwhile learning      tools. In most cases these involved the students in working      in the library-and with the instructors-to put      together handlettered and hand-drawn "books" on a chosen      topic. Again, such activities served to stress the point      that "plain people" can look for-and often      find-the answers to "complicated" medical questions.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT WE <em>SHOULD</em>      HAVE DONE    </h3>    <p>      <em>After</em> the classes were over (naturally), we      thought of all kinds of wonderful things that could have      been done. For example, we might have pointed out      <em>bad</em> health habits with a game called "Make      Yourself Sick" . . . in which each child would try to think      of ways to make his or her health <em>worse. (Good</em>      habits would then, of course, be emphasized by contrast.)      We should also have included some means of evaluating the      class. Perhaps a "draw the inside of your body" test or a      "how you feel about doctors" questionnaire-if the      latter were given before <em>and</em> after the      course-would have been helpful in determining the      value of our experiment.    </p>    <p>      Of course, "special classes" can only reach a few      youngsters over a short period of time. What children need      is a <em>continuing</em> health focus ... in their daily      school schedules <em>and</em> in the home. If we can find      ways to develop a regular program of medical awareness and      selfcare for our youngsters, we'll be helping to build a      future world of healthier adults.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Tom Ferguson's quarterly      periodical,</em> Medical Self-Care <em>(P.O.
