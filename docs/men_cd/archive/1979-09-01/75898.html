        <h2 id="subtitle">BEWARE THE IDES OF JULY</h2><p>It was ballyhooed-Little Jimmy Carter's much-awaited Sunday night speech last July 15th-as something that would be "the most important statement of<br />Carter's presidency" and "a fresh, bold, new approach to our energy and economic problems".</p><p>Instead, it was just another of Carter's misdirected sermons (delivered in an agitated-yet-halting, Nixon-like manner that-apparently-was supposed to<br />suggest leadership . . . but which came across merely as thin, irritating, and strident).</p><p>And there was nothing fresh, bold, or new about it. It was the same old Jimmy-that night and during the days which followed-serving up the same tired old<br />ideas: "I intend to push at least 142 billion dollars' worth of additional government meddling into your<br />lives . . . ram more nuclear white elephants down your throats . . . rape your air, the water your children drink, and the country's land with the worst possible 'synfuel' program that can be devised ... and create<br />turmoil and confusion by calling the oil companies names, cursing the OPEC nations, and enforcing government-mandated fuel allocations and wage/price<br />'guidelines' which can only disrupt and hamstring the natural laws of supply and demand."</p><p>All topped, of course, by what Little Jimmy seemed to think was his all-around Good Guy/Great Visionary/Wonderful Environmentalist trump card: "Trust me<br />and this new 142-billiondollar morass of government interference that I intend to create . . . and by the year 1990, I'll fulfill a full 20% of America's energy<br />requirements with the sun?"</p><p>Dear Lord! When will the idiots in Washington (and Carter, unfortunately, is only one of a multitude) realize that virtually everything on this planet-directly or<br />indirectly-either comes from or is powered by the sun?</p><p>We live in a Grade A, certified, nearly 100% solar economy right now! We always have. We always will. And it's high time Little Jimmy Carter and the rest of<br />the pygmies along the Potomac began to realize exactly what that means. And what it means is this:</p><p>Everything that everyone touches or uses or does every day and every night is-either directly or indirectly-almost 100% solar powered. ("Almost" because<br />there are a few other forces in the universe which do influence life on earth . . . such as the mass of the moon which can-for instance-affect the globe's<br />tides, starlight that also strikes our planet's surface, random meteorites and space "dust" which add a certain amount of mass to the world each year, etc.)</p><p>For all practical purposes, however, everything that we need and want and use every day and night of our lives either directly or indirectly comes from the<br />sun . . . is purified by the sun . . . is renewed by the sun . . . is powered by the sun . . . is changed from a form that we cannot use into a form that we can<br />use by solar energy.</p><p>The sun's rays drive the whole hydrological cycle which "distills" water from the earth's oceans, transports that vapor to the planet's land masses, and<br />condenses it into cool rains. Rains which slowly transform rock into soil, refresh the earth's vegetation and animals, and carry nutrients down into the oceans<br />for the use of aquatic life before-once again-endlessly repeating the same vital solar-powered cycle.</p><p>That's the biggie. And while it's going on, myriad forms of plant life-supported by solar-created soil-are busily collecting of Sol's rays and turning them into<br />biomass (roots, stems, branches, leaves, blossoms, fruit, seeds, etc.). Which-in turn-feeds animals, birds, and humans . . . houses us, clothes us,<br />warms us when we burn it . . . sometimes turns into petroleum, natural gas, and coal for our later use . . . serves us in countless other ways , . . or simply<br />falls over and decomposes into soil which eventually supports new vegetation that just as faithfully feeds us, houses us, clothes us, etc. the next time<br />around.</p><p>And all the while, that same solar-powered plant life is shading us in the summer and then automatically dropping its leaves during the winter so that more of<br />the sun's rays will reach us just when we need them most. And that vegetation is constantly using solar radiation to purify our air and our water for us. And<br />to regulate our micro-climate while-on a planetary scale-another portion of the sun's rays which strike the earth's atmosphere is powering the winds which<br />distribute the pollen that fertilizes our crops . . . and turn the blades of our windmills .. and push our sailing vessels across the oceans ... and distribute<br />those cooling rains . . . and do so much more to make human life and commerce possible.</p><p>In short: We live in a solar economy now, we always have, and we always will. And our intricately interrelated, solar-powered web of life operates-and can<br />only operate-on a decentralized, planetwide, all-inclusive basis. The cooling of the shaded side of the globe exactly balances the warming of the planet's<br />sunlight face . . . what goes up over the oceans must eventually come down on the land . . . the pack rat which scampers along the spine of the Rocky<br />Mountains is indeed distantly related to the sea slug burrowing into the bottom of the Pacific.</p><p>Furthermore, you can't tear a hole in that solar-driven, planetary web of life anywhere on the earth's surface ... without making the web tremble-albeit ever<br />so slightly-everywhere on the face of the globe. Little rips, of course, send very small shock waves across the mesh of life. But large rents-the overgrazing<br />of the Sahel in Africa, the bulldozing away of the Amazon Basin, or the pulverizing of our western states' shale into oil-can visibly alter our planet's weather<br />patterns, change rich valleys into barren deserts, and pit brother against brother 10,000 miles away.</p><p>It is obvious, then, that the way of life which is best for our society is that way which most nearly parallels the natural lines of force . . . that way which<br />does the least damage to our delicate solar-powered web of life . . . that way which is most evenly spread out and balanced and decentralized.</p><p>Decentralization. That's the key.</p><p>Yet another massive, centralized, bureaucrat-ridden, 142-billion-dollar (which, as we all know, will probably wind up costing us trillions in the end) rape of the<br />planet is the last thing we need to "solve" our current problems. That's only more of the same lunacy which got us into our present absurd position in the first<br />place. There's nothing "fresh" or "bold" or "new" about such a "solution" at all. It's merely an unimaginative extension of the identical line of thought that<br />exterminated the passenger pigeon, nearly wiped out the buffalo, and turned the rich loam of the Great Plains into a dust bowl.</p><p>God save us from any more such "solutions". Especially when the real answer to our self-inflicted problems is shining down upon us.</p><p>Solar energy. It already powers the world's whole ecosystem and all of man- and womankind's economy. And it's so wonderfully decentralized and all-<br />pervasive that every one of us can tap into it merely by putting a few seeds into the ground, or setting a black-painted container of water outside, or adding a<br />row of south-facing windows to our home.</p><p>So come on, Mr. Carter. Do something that's really fresh and bold and new: Declare a New Day for the ordinary citizens of your nation . . . and not just for<br />yet another layer of bureaucrats and squanderers of the country's wealth and plunderers of our beautiful planet.</p><p>Encourage the American people-on their own and with their own two hands and without any government grants at all-in the construction of passively solar-<br />tempered, earth-sheltered homes. Encourage them to build those dwellings in small, decentralized, food self-sufficient, energy self-sufficient, self-governing,<br />self-reliant, pedestrian communities. Encourage them to rediscover themselves and their families and their neighbors in good, hard, clean, meaningful work.</p><p>In other words, encourage your fellow citizens to gather up all the taxing bureaucrats and wasteful politicians who exist only at the expense of each<br />productive citizen . . . and "throw the rascals out"! We'll never miss 'em. Especially if you encourage those citizens to readopt (a modernized version of) the<br />Jeff ersonian ideals on which this still-great Republic was founded.</p><p>And if you must spend untold billions of our dollars . . . well, at least just this once, please spend that money on something that really will do everyone some<br />genuine good and something that is self-limiting because the money only has to be spent once: Spend it on basic solar energy research. Then make the<br />resulting "breakthroughs" freely available to everyone, and let us use the new-found power and self-reliance that we'll have in our hands toonce and for all-get<br />the increasingly heavy Big Government, Big Business, Big Labor, Big Brother monkeys off our backs.</p><p>For you see, Mr. President, just as an old Roman observed many, many years ago: The fault lies not in our stars (and most especially not in the one star-<br />our sun-from which nearly every fragment of our lives already flows). The fault lies in ourselves, that we are underlings.</p><p>Beware the Ides of July, Mr. President. For the "fresh" and "bold" and "new" approach to our problems which you so stridently outlined on that night-if<br />taken to its logical conclusion-will kill us all and our beautiful planet too.</p><p>And that would be a very foolish thing for us to allow to happen. Since-if we'll only open our eyes and "let the sun shine in"-we'll discover that we have a<br />whole new world of peace, plenty, and prosperity within our grasp.</p>
