                    <p>      If you now operate-or ever operated-a      successful home business that was inspired by an article      you read in MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or less) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"-you      started your venture. Because if your story can be fitted      into an upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES,      you'll receive (1] the warm satisfaction of knowing that      you helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy and PI      a free two-year new or renewal subscription to ME MOTHER      EARTH NEWS'.    </p>    <p>      One day last year I attended an arts and crafts show ...      and-after viewing the large variety of handmade items on      display-[ began to think about selling my own handicrafts.      After all, I'd been crocheting Christmas, wedding, and baby      presents for friends and relatives for quite some time! ...      so, I figured, why not use my skill to make some extra      money?    </p>    <p>      That same week-while still toying with my business idea-I      read MOTHER for the first time me ... a& Were in      &we No. 52 on page 36, was a piece entitled "How to Go      to Work for Yourself". I read it and reread it ... and      finally decided to follow the article's advice. So, I      registered with the tax department (at a cost of $1.00),      invested $25 in a set of business cards, spent $75 on a      supply of yarn ... and began crocheting! (I even used my      vast mounds of leftover yarn to create a variety of      multicolored vests, afghans, and the like.)    </p>    <p>      Within just a few months I had a large enough stock of      clothing and gift items to really start business. My work      had been displayed at three arts and crafts shows and I was      beginning to create my own designs (some of which were      submitted to needlework magazines). I'd been working      steadily on custom orders (as a result of a commission to      sell on consignment at a local gift shop) and-after having      an article accepted by Crochet World-I'd even been asked to      do a regular column for that publication!    </p>    <p>      Each craft show has earned me approximately $45 per day, my      custom orders have proved even more profitable, and I have      a future steady paycheck from Crochet World coming my way.      Sure, it may take some time for my business to make its      first million, but-meanwhile-I'm sure having fun getting      paid for my hobby!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Barbara A. Chojnacki<br />      Pawcaluck, Conn.</strong>    </p>    <p>      After living in suburbia for most of our lives, my family      and I finally bought a piece of country land and began      construction of a home. That undertaking required quite a      bit of cash, though, so we soon found ourselves kicking      around a number of moneymaking ideas.    </p>    <p>      At first we tried out a basement-cleaning/ junk-hauling      business ("I Pick Up Profits From a Pickup", MOTHER NO. 32,      page 24) ... a venture that provided us with numerous      fringe benefits. (The most abundant of such gratuities were      scrounged items that had either been thrown away or left      behind ... many of which became building materials for the      40-foot geodesic dome we were constructing.) Our enterprise      also provided-on the average-a fairly good income,      but it quickly became clear that the earnings were not      steady enough to meet our needs.    </p>        <p>      As it turned out, however, I'd acquired quite a few      woodworking implements from those hauling jobs including a      saber saw and a Skilsaw -and I'd paid about $100 for a      router and a few assorted bits to round out my tool supply.      The router had already had a couple of trial runs ... first      at the request of a friend who needed a sign with his name      carved on it, and several more times when (after I noted      how well my first attempt at the craft had turned out) I      produced a few placards as gifts. Shortly thereafter I read      "Dimensional Wood Signs ... How to Make 'Em and Sell 'Em",      Parts I and II in Issue No's. 36 (page 72) and 37 (page 74)      respectively, as well as the addendum in No. 38 (page 30)      ... and I knew-without a doubt that I could turn my hobby      into a profitable venture.    </p>    <p>      At first business was rather slow ... but my family took on      a variety of small woodworking jobs-in addition to an      occasional junk hauling gig-and somehow we managed to      survive. Then my skills began to improve, my reputation      spread, and I was being commissioned to build signs for      organizations (including a series for the local chamber of      commerce) and individuals alike. As my enterprise expanded,      so did my assortment of appliances ... and before long      "Signs by Harry" could produce just about every type of      placard imaginable and had grossed $7,500 in its first 12      months (this year I expect to double that amount!).    </p>    <p>      My family and I put plenty of hard work into our home sign      business, but none A our good fortune would ever have come      to pass if it hadn't been for THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>'. In      fact, I still often refer to Wow first sign craft articles      to help me along in the course of my workday.      And-every other month-I eagerly anticipate the      arrival of the latest issue of MOTHER ... wondering what      new do-it-yourself idea she'll involve me in next!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Harry Klaus<br />      White Cloud, Mich.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I belong to a food coop in Middle town , Connecticut that      not only sells the best natural foods around ... but also      boasts a magazine/book section and a free lending library.      Therefore, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>' is readily available to      me and-as a result-I've had quite a bit of help from MOM      over the Years ... particularly in setting up home      businesses.    </p>    <p>      Back in Issue No. 36 (page 101), for example, MOTHER ran an      article called "Yes, Virginia, There Is a Free Lunch ...      It's Called the Solar Greenhouse!" After reading that      piece, I promptly built myself a "hothouse" (largely from      free, recycled materials) ... and began selling organic      produce to the Middletown Co-op. (The greenhouse expanded      my growing season and provided me with enough surplus      fruits and vegetables to bring in quite a nice profit.)    </p>    <p>      Shortly thereafter I stumbled upon a write-up called      "Sprouts Fill Our Pockets With Cash" (MOTHER NO. 54, page      64), and I immediately added sprouts to the kinds of      produce I was selling to the co-op and to local      restaurants. I planted the shoots in little      "greenhouses"plastic shoe boxes with lids-and delivered      them still growing in their containers to my customers.      (Alfalfa sprouts-plus a blend of alfalfa, crimson clover,      radish, and fennel-became my specialties.)    </p>    <p>      Business proceeded fairly well for some time, and then one      day I discovered a MOTHER article entitled "How to Start a      Home Bakery of Your Own" (issue No. 37, page 46). 1      realized that the establishments that bought my organic      veggies would be likely candidates for the purchase of      homebaked goods, as well ... and that such a project would      be a convenient way of bringing in a little extra money. So      I invested a few dollars in some pans and fresh-ground      flour, and set out to bake a passel of whole-grain loaves.      Before long I started playing around with some recipes of      my own: I came up with a few unusual varieties of bread      such as carobraisin-cinnamon-whole-wheat-and then sales      really began to pick up. (One-and-a-half-pound loaves of my      novel recipe-which cost me 404 apiece to produce-sell for      90  cents each.)    </p>    <p>      I'd noticed, too, that consumers were growing more and more      fearful of sugar- and preservative-laden foods ... and I      thought there must be some way around using those hazardous      ingredients in the production of many popular edibles.      Consequently, I began experimenting with dessert and snack      food recipes ... and in no time I had three big sellers:      [1] Homemade Halvah (a Middle Eastern sweet made of toasted      sesame seeds, carob powder, sesame butter, a" honey), [2]      Peanut Witter Cups (a confection prepared from carob      powder, peanut butter, and honey), and [3] Carob Pudding (a      blend of carob powder, honey or barley malt, and regular,      soy, or nut milk) ... or Fruit Pudding (the same recipe      with arrowroot and fruit juice substituted for the carob      powder).    </p>    <p>      My home food business-dubbed "Johnny Random Cottage      Industry"-has provided my family and me with quite a      comfortable living for a number of years now ... all      because MOTHER showed us that-even in the midst of today's      oppressive economy - self-sufficiency is not impossible!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hyman Srulo<br />      Durham, Conn.</strong>    </p>    <p>      My husband and I-like many MOTHER readers-were      trying to gather together enough money to buy a small      homestead ... but it seemed that our goal would take      forever to accomplish if we had to depend on one salary. I      wanted to contribute to the savings we'd been slowly      accumulating ... but with five children to care for, I knew      I couldn't hold down a regular job. Consequently, I put      myself in MOTHER's hands in the hope of finding a      home-based source of income.    </p>    <p>      As luck would have it, I came across an article in Issue      No. 55, page 87 entitled "Grandma's Four-Strand Braided      Rug" . . . that was definitely for me! I knew I could get      all the scrap material I needed-free for the hauling-from      two clothes factories in my immediate area, and I was aware      that handmade rugs would be a hot item at the local flea      market. But where, I wondered, could I get the money to      rent a flea-market table for an extended period of time?    </p>    <p>      Once again, I trusted in MOTHER and-as      always-she came up with the solution ... in a piece      called "How to Earn $500 a Month Recycling Metals" (issue      No. 50, page 118). The children and I promptly gathered up      a horde of aluminum cans and transported them-along with my      offspring's old metal swing set-to a nearby recycling      center ... and, with money in our pockets, we set out      toward the flea market.    </p>    <p>      There we rented two stands at a cost of $3.00 per table per      day ... and I displayed my wares for sale. I'd made two      sizes of floor coverings: a 2' X 3' rug priced at $3.00,      which takes an average of two hours to cut, sew, and weave      ... and a 3' X 5' version for $5.00, which takes about      three hours to produce (my daughter helps me with the      braiding). The young'uns accompany me to my selling post      every weekend, and sales have been averaging $20 to $50 per      day!    </p>    <p>      At this rate-thanks to MOTHER-my family's      "fantasy" homestead is very close at hand!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Joan Walters<br />      Edgewater, Fla..</strong>    </p>
