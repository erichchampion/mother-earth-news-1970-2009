                        <p>      Trees are all too often a scarce resource in North      America's cities, and this "urban deforestation" is      unfortunate for a number of reasons. Streetside greenery      can, for example, soften a harsh urban environment, absorb      pollution, cool the hot summer air, and-most      important-provide a highly visible symbol of      neighborhood revitalization.    </p>    <p>      Many of today's stretched-to-the-breaking-point city      budgets just don't include enough money to provide for tree      planting and maintenance, however, and-even when      modest efforts are made-urban trees suffer very high      mortality rates. (In New York City, for instance, species      that would-in the country-survive for upward of      50 years usually die in less than seven!) The problem is a      combination of urban vandalism and the fact that most      metropolitan tree-planting is done by city crews whose      members are ignorant of basic tree care techniques.    </p>    <p>      Recently, though, community planting projects-in which      residents plant and care for their own trees-have begun to      reverse the trend toward greenless cities. The Oakland      (California) Tree Task Force, for example, has established      an urban forest-planted by neighborhood residentsin a      vacant lot next to one of the city's "toughest" schools.    </p>    <p>      The Oakland group set up their planting day as a community      fair ... complete with food, balloons, T-shirts, and a disc      jockey from a local radio station. When the area youngsters      showed up looking for a good Am, The Task Force folks      showed them how to plant and care for the trees. You can be      sure that-after having a hand in its creation-the students      made sure their forest was protected.    </p>    <p>      In fact, only one of the schoolside trees has been lost to      vandalism so far ... and the neighborhood "foresters"      quickly learned that the damage had been done by a boy who      had not participated in the fair. (The Task Force suggested      &at he youngster plant a replacement ... he was delighted      to have the chance, and the forest has been thriving ever      since.)    </p>    <p>      Not long ago, the Oakland Tree Task Force re-formed into a      new organization called ON TOP (Oakland Neighborhood Tree      Organizing Program). The group can be reached-for      more information-at 3803 Broadway, No. 2, Oakland,      California 94609.    </p>    <p>      Philadelphia is another example of a city with a thriving      urban greening program. The Pennsylvania Horticultural      Society provides young trees (at $5.00 each) to any      neighborhood in which 80% of the residents petition for the      service. The Society also arrranges for the required      permits and provides a machine for any necessary sidewalk      cutting ... while the neighborhood residents remove the      pavement, dig the pits, and plant the trees.    </p>    <p>      Once the young plants are in the ground, the PHS people      provide stakes and wires as needed, plus advice on tree      care. This project and others like it-involving      community participation-have made Pennsylvania a      model "urban agriculture" state. If you'd like to know more      about the commonwealth's programs, write Philadelphia      Green, 325 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106.    </p>    <p>      While the Pennsylvania tree planting movement is run      through the state's Horticultural Society, a Los Angeles      group called TreePeople demonstrates what can be      accomplished on a more personal scale ... with a project      that started out as a oneman operation! Because, although      TreePeople founder Andy Lipkus now has a staff of nine      helpers, he began his arboreal endeavor alone . . . and his      group has since helped residents plant more than 5,000      trees (of smog-tolerant species) throughout southern      California. In fact, the group's education program will      have reached some 15,000 people by the end of 1979! You can      write to TreePeople at 12601 Mulholland Drive, Beverly      Hills, California 90201.    </p>    <p>      The Boston Urban Gardeners (BUG), another "city forestry"      organization, has gone to the economic "roots" of the      problem and established a series of smallscale community      nurseries in an effort to produce trees that city residents      can afford. According to BUG, a tiny 70 cents Japanese      cherry seedling can grow to be five feet tall in less than      three years in an urban tree garden. (And such an      established tree would sell for as much as $30 at a      commercial nursery.) The group is in the process of growing      scores of affordable ornamentals ... that add greenery to      land which (because of contamination from lead and other      heavy metals) is unfit for vegetable gathering.    </p>    <p>      Anyone who'd like to learn more about such community-based      tree planting projects as the Boston Urban Gardeners (or      any of the other organizations mentioned in this article)      should contact the Green Leaf Flyer ... a newsletter      published by Isabel Wade, 783 Buena Vista West San      Francisco, California 94117.    </p>    <p>      <em>You can have a free catalog of ILSR's selection of books      and pamphlets by sending Me Institute a self-addressed,      stamped envelope.
