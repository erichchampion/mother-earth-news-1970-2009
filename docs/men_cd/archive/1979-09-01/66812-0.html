        RIGHT: A lot of future ""fuel fixers"" got the practical know?how they needed at MOTHER's one-day farmer's alcohol session. TOP RIGHT: The dedicated students at the three-day earth-sheltered homes seminar stayed in class until 8:00 every night!

TOP LEFT: MOTHER's folks mixed some pleasure with their ""business"" by listening to an authentic mountain story teller . . . watching an engaging puppet show . . . clapping along with some downhome music . . . and enjoying cookouts at an evening bonfire.
