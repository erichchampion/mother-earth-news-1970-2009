                        <p>      Most home gardens still have bushels of green tomatoes      coming on when the first frosts of the season knock the      tomato plants dead. That, however, didn't stop      great-grandpa and great-grandma from enjoying fresh,      homegrown "love apples" right up to Thanksgiving and      beyond. And it needn't stop you either.    </p>    <p>      Just pull a few of your tomato plants up by the roots (or      cut the stalks off at ground level) a few days before the      first killing frost. Then hang 'em upside down in the fruit      cellar (or anyplace that's dark and fairly cool without      being cold). The fruit will continue to ripen on the vines      throughout the fall and, if you're lucky, you'll still be      eating fresh, homegrown tomatoes into the early days of      December ... maybe even beyond.    </p>    <p>      Really experienced practitioners of this form of "root      cellar gardening" also have another trick up their sleeves:      They know that storing a few bushels of apples close to the      upsidedown stalks will cause the tomatoes to ripen faster.      (Ripening apples give off ethylene, a gas that can hasten      the maturity of some other fruits and vegetables, including      tomatoes.) Use the idea, or avoid it, as necessary to make      your love apples table-ready just when you want to serve      'em up.    </p>    <p>      Nope. Not every tomato on every vine you save will finally      wind up in the kitchen (some of the fruit simply will never      get ripe). And, of course, nobody expected you to eat the      stalks in the first place. So? So, throw the wilted tomato      plants and all the fruit that doesn't make it to the table      on the compost pile when you've finished with them ... and      recycle 'em into next year's garden!    </p>
