                 <p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>          <h5 id="byline">by NANCY BUBEL</h5>    <p>      <br />      Sometimes it's hard to find storage space for all those      canned goods you put up for the winter, but June Egland of      Nekoosa, Wisconsin knows a way to create temporary shelves      that work very well.    </p>    <p>      "My husband came up with this idea," June writes. "You just      lay several ordinary cement blocks flat and add planks as      shown in the sketch."    </p>        <p>      The shelves are easy to assemble and can be stacked to any      height, and the space between planks nicely accommodates      either quart- or pint-sized bottles (leaving the top      shelves for larger jars). Best of all, this storage      arrangement <em>can</em> be permanent ... or can be easily      dismantled for relocation or when no longer needed.    </p>    <p>      If you're saving odds and ends of fat until you've      accumulated enough to make soap, take a tip from William      Welch of Portland, Oregon: Cover the stored grease with a      weak solution of lye. That way it won't turn moldy or      rancid before you have a chance to use it.    </p>    <p>      When Joy Blanchard of Silver Springs, Nevada prepares dried      beans, she adds one teaspoon of ground ginger to the      cooking water for each pound of the beans. The spice      affects flavor very little, and works better than baking      soda to counteract the wellknown gas-generating tendency of      legumes, Joy says.    </p>    <p>      If those comfortable, well-cut jeans you just bought turn      out-after their first washing-to be too short,      take a tip from Joan de Vitry of Marietta, Pennsylvania.      All you have to do to lengthen your "high water" pants      attractively is sew a cuff of denim salvaged from another      pair of Old Faithfuls to the bottom of each pant leg. The      only trick to remember is to make sure that this added-on      cuff is twice as <em>long</em> as the jeans you're working      on are too short. Then turn up the added material so that      it covers the seams, and take several small stitches in the      side seams of the turnups to keep them from sagging.    </p>    <p>      Since it's natural for the "wrong" side of the denim to      appear on a turned-up cuff, you needn't worry about      matching the scrap fabric to the jeans you're lengthening.    </p>    <p>      While we're on the subject of lengthening: "When trying to      let down the children's skirts and slacks, my wife has      always found it so difficult to iron away the old hemlines      and cuff lines," writes Howard Berg of Concord, California.      "Then a neighbor suggested dampening both the creased      material and the pressing cloth with a solution of three      tablespoons of white vinegar to one cup of water. It works      like a charm-even on synthetic fabrics-and it's      sure saved us a bundle on school clothes."    </p>    <p>      Here's another helpful use for your indispensable household      vinegar. Bargain fabrics may be easy on the budget, but      unfortunately they sometimes fade after only a few      washings. To help inexpensive sewing material retain its      original colors, Mary Buckingham of Davis, California      advises that you soak the cloth for at least 48 hours in a      solution of 1/2 cup white vinegar to a gallon of water      before you start to sew with it.    </p>    <p>      And before you put away the vinegar jug, Judie      Friedman-Misterka of Dillsburg, Pennsylvania has yet      another use for the all-purpose acid. When her electric      steam iron went on the blink, Judie poured fullstrength      vinegar into the iron's water well and left it there for 20      minutes, then dumped the liquid out and thoroughly rinsed      the iron's reservoir with plain water. Apparently this      treatment dissolved some of the mineral deposit that was      clogging the appliance's steam apparatus, because the iron      worked well again with no further ado. You might try the      same method on mineral-encrusted teakettles.    </p>    <p>      If the belt on your treadle sewing machine should become      loose, just remove the staple that holds it together, cut      about 1/4 inch from each end of the strip, and use an awl      or nail to punch a hole near the edge of the leather at      each end. Then sew the ends together with heavy thread      ("Button and Carpet" if possible). Debi Perrywinkle of      Miranda, California says she's used the same leather belt      (repaired in this way) on her machine for five years.    </p>        <p>      Or suppose you're stuck with a broken drive belt on your      electric sewing machine? That, too, you can fix yourself,      according to Maureen Darby of Leslie, Arkansas. Cut a piece      of 1/4-inch-wide elastic about 10 inches long and tie the      ends together in a square knot. Then stretch this loop      between the small wheel (near the motor) and the large      wheel (right where the drive belt was before it broke). It      the elastic circlet is too loose, just untie it, snip off      an inch or so, and reknot It. The new loop should fit      tightly enough so that a slight turn of the large wheel      with your hand will start the machine. When you resume      stitching, the makeshift drive belt should work fine.    </p>    <p>      Put an end to that ice-cold seat in your unheated outhouse!      Treat yourself to an inexpensive, ringshaped styrofoam pool      toy <em>...</em> and perch on that instead of on frigid      wood. And thank W.B. McConnell of Presque Isle, Maine for      sharing his discovery with the rest of us.    </p>    <p>      Kathleen Keith of Ramona, California swears by this method      for home-style car radiator repair: Mix a batch of epoxy      cement, using equal amounts of the two components of the      glue. Add a walnut-sized clump of steel wool for each two      tubes of epoxy used, and mix well. Make sure the edges of      the hole to be repaired are dry, and apply the sticky wad      of cement to the gap, filling it in completely. Then let      the mended patch dry thoroughly before you refill the      radiator. Even a large hole can be sealed in this way, says      Kathleen, and a spot so patched should never again be a      source of leakage.    </p>    <p>      Will you be clearing land in the spring? Before you chop      all those stumps down to ground level, remember this advice      given to Mary Gene Beheler of Ona, West Virginia by her      neighbor (a farmer of some 50 years experience). Cut the      saplings off at waist height, because the longer stumps      will rot more readily and are much less hazardous to      grazing critters and tractor tires.    </p>    <p>      Problem: How to hold a chain saw steady while you're      sharpening the chain. Solution: Make a jig like the one      described by Bernard Davies of Remsen, New York. You'll not      only save time, but also have a sharper saw, since you'll      be able to file all the teeth at the same angle. Also, by      thus making the sharpening chore easier, you'll be      encouraging yourself to do the job as soon as it becomes      necessary, rather than putting it off till the chain is      hopelessly dull and much harder to hone.    </p>        <p>      Ready to begin? Select a log that's at least 14 inches in      diameter and make a single rip cut down its center, as      shown in the diagram. This gash should be slightly longer      than the chain saw bar, and deep enough so that just the      top inch of the bar and chain protrudes.    </p>    <p>      Next, saw out a rectangular opening in the chunk of wood      (at one end of the cut) so that the powerhead portion of      the saw will just fit into the cut-out space, with one inch      of bare chain exposed. Then set the saw in the jig and file      away!    </p>     <p>      Since the commercial weatherstripping for entranceways is      made for doors that hang square in the frame-and      since the exterior doors of old farmhouses are usually      warped and ill-fitting-Judy Daily of Reedstown,      Wisconsin notes that it's often necessary to improvise      one's own draft stoppers.    </p>    <p>      What Judy did was sew double-layered strips of heavy,      brightly printed cloth into tubes the length of her door      openings. Each tube was sewn inside out, with one end left      open, so that no seam edges would show when the contrivance      was turned right side out. Judy next filled the long,      skinny "pillows" with sand, and then stitched the open ends      closed.    </p>    <p>      According to their creator, one of these tubes looks much      better flopped against a door than an old coat or towel or      folded rug would.    </p>    <p>      It can be difficult-or downright dangerous-to      get a stubborn horse to give you its leg when you want to      clean or treat some part of the appendage. But here's a      gentle, persuasive technique that works well for Mike Klein      of Wolcott, New York.    </p>    <p>      First, tie the horse at head height to a sturdy support. If      you want to work on the animal's left front foot, start by      lightly touching the left side of his neck and stroking      downward over his shoulder. Then, move your hand slowly      down the Inside of Dobbin's left leg.    </p>    <p>      When your hand is just below the knee, press your index      finger into the leg (cannon) bone. Pressure on this spot      will cause the horse to raise his foot ... right to where      you want it.    </p>    <p>      To work on a hind leg, use the same gradual stroking      approach, starting at the hip and working your hand down,      until you reach the cannon bone at a point just below the      hock. It's some. times necessary to press the spot for up      to 30 seconds, but Mike says the horse will eventually give      you his leg.    </p>    <p>      "I was glad for the young Leghorn rooster that a friend      gave me to round out our henhouse population," writes Brian      Sharkany of Miami, Florida, "but the cock would attack me      whenever I'd go near. I found a simple way to outwit the      bird, though, without resorting to strongarm methods.    </p>    <p>      "I tied a loop of soft twine around the rooster's neck,      with a larger loop suspended from it ... just clearing the      ground. Whenever the Leghorn springs at a victim now, his      feet get caught in the lower loop. He suffers only from      humiliation, and should soon decide that fighting isn't      worth the trouble."    </p>    <p>      Brian added that he does check frequently to be sure the      bird doesn't become tangled in the string while undergoing      this peacemaking treatment.    </p>    <p>      "When we moved last spring," writes Janice Witul of      Berkeley, California, "a farmer who came to look at the      heifer I was selling gave me some good advice. When you're      trying to sell an animal that has been accustomed to      roaming free in an open space, don't tie or pen the critter      to show it more easily to prospective buyers. Such sudden      close confinement can make a free-running animal 'gait up',      as the farmer put it. It may go off its feed or even      develop diarrhea, and generally appear less fat and healthy      than it usually does."    </p>    <p>      Luckily, Janice adds, the farmer had seen her penned heifer      unconfined and in good condition a few days before, so he      bought the animal anyway.    </p>    <p>      It takes a bit of old-timey know-how to keep rugs clean      without electric equipment ... like this tip from Sandy      Lesko of Aurora, Colorado: When sweeping a rug with a straw      broom, always sprinkle a little water on the carpet first      ... to keep the dust down and help the broom sweep clean.    </p>    <p>      Erik Watts of Ft. Collins, Colorado has come up with the      ultimate bird feeder ... one that used no wood, nails, milk      cartons, or suet. Erik's attractive, uncomplicated, and      completely recyclable feeder is ... a sunflower head! Hang      the "cafeteria" from a tree, seeded side up, by rigging      together a simple sling of string. (Add macrame and beads,      If you like!) When the birds have polished off the seeds,      just toss what's left of the sunflower top onto the compost      hasp and suspend another head in its place.    </p>        <p>      Do you have a good bottle that's standing useless because a      cork has been pushed into it ... and all efforts to fish      the stopper out have failed? Sharon Albertson of      Ridgefield, Washington has the answer for you. Just pour      enough ammonia into the bottle to float the cork, and wait      48 hours ... or until the chemical disintegrates the cork      and there's nothing left of the troublesome stopper but      pieces small enough to pour.    </p>
