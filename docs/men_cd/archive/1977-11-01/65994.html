    <p>
                       <p>      Sometimes it's going to happen for the "right" reason      (genuine dwindling reserves of the easily tapped fossil      fuels on which our society has become so desperately      hooked). Sometimes it's going to happen for the "wrong"      reasons (Carter's fiasco of massive new government meddling      and crushing taxes masquerading as an energy "plan", say,      or profiteering by the utilities, multinational      corporations, and others who supply the oil, gas, coal,      electricity, etc., that we all use). And sometimes it's      going to happen for both the right and the wrong reasons at      the same time.    </p>    <p>      But for whatever reason or combination of reasons it takes      place, there's no question about what's going to happen:      The price of all the "traditional" (fossil fuel and fossil      fuelderived) energy you use from now on is going to go in      just one direction ... UP!    </p>    <p>      Oh, there'll be welcome little short-term reversals of that      basic trend from time to time. (Right now, for      instancethanks to new production from Britain's North Sea      fields, Mexico's sudden exports of oil, the opening of the      North Slope in Alaska, increased pumping in Saudi Arabia      last summer, and some other factors-the world is mildly      awash in petroleum, and there's some rather frantic oil and      gasoline price cutting going on behind the scenes.)    </p>    <p>      For all practical purposes, though, these fleeting      discombobulations can be ignored (after, of course, you've      taken maximum advantage of them whenever they present      themselves). Keep your eye on the basic trend. And that      very basic and very, very strong trend-now, and for      as far into the future as you can possibly care to      peer-is for the price of all "traditional" forms of      energy to rise and rise and to keep on rising.    </p>    <p>      Then again, there's nothing engraved on-a stone      tablet anywhere that says you have to remain a big-time      captive customer of the fossil fuel industry in the first      place.    </p>    <p>      You might, for example, build and move into an Andy      Davis-type underground house (see The Plowboy Interview in      MOTHER NO. 46) ... and then sail completely through the      coldest winter in over 100 years (the winter of 1976-77) on      only $1.29 worth of heating fuel the way Andy just did.    </p>    <p>      Or you might have David Wright, who now lives in a 93%      heating and cooling self-sufficient home of his own design      (see The Plowboy Interview in MOTHER NO. 47) draw up a set      of plans for your family.    </p>    <p>      You could even have Jesse J. Savell (See "Here's a      Passively Heated and Cooled House That You Can Afford ...      and Will Want") put up one of his energymiser dwellings for      you.    </p>    <h3>BUT WHAT IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE INTO ONE OF      THOSE NEW ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOMES?</h3>    <p>      "Well, that's all very nice," a number of you have recently      told us, "and we certainly thank MOTHER for bringing these      new breakthroughs in energyefficient housing to our      attention. But we can't afford a place like that just now.      We're going to have to stay where we are for a while. And      we aren't even sure we can afford that! What can we do      right now to cut the amount of energy we'll have to use to      keep our current home warm this winter? And don't tell us      to have insulation installed ... because we can't afford a      bill for $300 or $400 or more for that either and, besides,      most of the contractors who install insulation have a      backlog of orders as it is."    </p>    <h3>YOU CAN MAKE AND INSTALL YOUR OWN      INSULATION!</h3>    <p>      But who says you have to pay today's outrageous prices for      insulation? (One contractor we know hiked his prices three      times in the month of August alone!) And who says you have      to put your name in the pot and then patiently wait days or      even weeks until an insulating firm can get to you?    </p>    <p>      Nobody, that's who! Not when you can quickly, safely, and      easily manufacture one of the best insulations ever      devised. Not when you can make that insulation to equal or      far exceed the specifications (fireproofing, vermin-      proofing, etc.) of any manufacturer in the field. And not      when you can do it all by yourself in your spare time and      for just one-fifth or less of the out-of-pocket cost of      what a probably inferior insulation would set you back if      you hired a contra ctor to install it for you.    </p>    <p>      Yeah, sure. This all sounds too good to be true. But that's      only because you've spent your whole life being brainwashed      into The Perfect Little Consumer. And that's not your      fault. Nowadays, even the mechanics and shop magazines      (which, 30 years ago, would have given you exactly the sort      of information that MOTHER is now gonna lay on you)      maintain the polite-and, for you, expensive!-fiction      that insulation somehow isn't actually insulation unless it      comes in a trademarked bag and a "real" contractor installs      it for you.    </p>    <h3>TAIN'T TRUE</h3>    <p>      Well, folks, that particular myth just ain't true. There      may well be a bewildering selection of insulations on the      current market. And some of them definitely are more      fireproof ... or more vermin-proof ... or more water      resistant ... or easier to install in new construction ...      or easier to blow into old walls ... or more this or less      that than any of the others. But when it comes to downright      cost effectiveness (even at contractor's prices), allaround      availability, ease of installation under almost any      conditions, minimum toxicity, and absolute minimum use of      the planet's resources in a highly "natural" way ... the      all-time winner and champion always has, still is, and      probably always will be ... plain ole cellulose fiber.    </p>    <p>      Yep. Cellulose fiber. Which is nothing but old newspapers,      cardboard boxes, and other kinds of waste paper ... ground      up fine ... and treated with some readily available and      inexpensive chemicals to make it self- extinguishing and      verminproof.    </p>    <p>      It's hard to think of a more readily available, a simpler,      or a less costly insulation ... yet the "R" factor (the      higher the "R", the better) of <em>each inch</em> of      cellulose fiber is a very respectable 4. Even when you buy      it ready-made, then, this is an extremely costeffective      insulation. And when you make it yourself your savings can      really skyrocket!<br />    </p>    <p>      That " makin' " is not in the least complicated either. as      MOTHER's researchers recently proved to themselves. It      mainly consists of [1] gathering together enough bone-dry      scrap cardboard or old newspapers, [2] running them through      a farm-type haMmermill set for its finest possible grind,      [3] mixing in-either before or after the cellulose is      groundenough fireproofing and vermin repellent to protect      it, and [4] putting the finished insulation where you want      it.    </p>  <h3> USE A FARM-TYPE HAMMERMILL</h3>    <p>      The only "complication" we've found about this whole      do-it-yourself project is that nothing less than a real,      live, genuine hammermill will handle the grinding of the      cellulose the way it should be handled. Little garden      mulcher-type "shredder grinders" simply won't chew either      paper or cardboard into the fluffy, fuzzy mass of fibers      that makes the best insulation. (Rule of thumb: If you can      still read whole words on your ground newsprint, it wasn't      ground finely enough.)    </p>    <p>      What you want to do then (if you don't already have one) is      rent or borrow or barter some time on one of the      feed-grinding hammermills that many farmers own (the units      are very much like the leaf grinders and limb shredders      that you frequently see utility line crews using alongside      the road).    </p>    <p>      Take care, too, to see that all the paper and cardboard you      feed through the grinder is bone dry and stays that way      (moisture can cause the shredded cellulose to "compost").      And always wear a respirator mask to protect your lungs      from both paper dust and fine chemical particles as you      work.    </p>    <p>      That last caution, by the way, is by no means meant to      suggest that the chemicals used to treat the cellulose are      in any way highly dangerous. Boric acid, the fire retardant      used by most manufacturers of this insulation, is-as      you probably know-so mild that doctors have      frequently prescribed it as an eyewash. This particular      fireproofer is now in such short supply, however (because      of the current tremendous demand for insulation), that      MOTHER's research crew has tested and presently recommends      fireproofing cellulose insulation with borax. And borax, as      you're surely aware, is so safe that it's the major      ingredient in some laundry soaps.    </p>    <p>      The aluminum sulfate listed here as a rodent and insect      repellent can best be put into perspective when you realize      that it's one of the chemicals generally called "alum"      (even though the term is more accurately descriptive of a      double sulfate of ammonium or a univalent metal-such as      sodium or potassium-and of a trivalent metal, such as      aluminum, iron, or chromium). The chemical, in short, is an      astringent and, as such, may be safely handled without      gloves (although we do recommend keeping its dust out of      your lungs and away from your mucous membranes). Do bear in      mind, however, that aluminum sulfate is highly corrosive to      most metals ... and, for this reason, an equal weight of      ordinary lime (which neutralizes the alum) should be      substituted for half the aluminum sulfate when your treated      insulation will be used in metal buildings or mobile homes.    </p>   <h3>THE PRICE IS RIGHT</h3>    <p>      As the first chart reproduced here indicates, MOTHER's      researchers ground up and tested six batches of cellulose      fiber ... each of which contained a different percentage of      vermin repellent and fireproofing. After trying to ignite      all the test mixes with a propane torch and observing the      results (see chart) , we recommend that a minimum of 25      pounds of aluminum sulfate (or half aluminum sulfate and      half lime) and 12 pounds of borax be mixed into every 100      pounds of ground newsprint or cardboard.    </p>    <p>      This figures out to a total chemical cost (at $8.50/100      pounds for aluminum sulfate and $15.00/100 pounds for      borax) of less than $4.00 per 100 pounds of paper that is      treated ... or 5 cents a square foot when an attic is      filled with a 6"-deep layer of the cellulose fiber (which      produces a total "R" factor of 24, and that's very good).      This compares quite favorably to the 24-1/2 cents a square      foot that a local contractor charges to fill an attic space      with only 5" of a commercially manufactured cellulose      fiber. On a 1,300-square-foot house, that's an immediate      saving of $253.50 right there ... and you're getting      one-fifth more insulation to boot!    </p>    <p>      The chemicals were mixed into our first six test batches by      shaking them onto the paper as it was fed into our      hammermill. This is exactly the method used by the      commercial manufacturers of cellulose fiber insulation that      we've visited ... but it does have a minor drawback: The      chemicals do tend to settle out of the mix as it's handled      and, if some care isn't taken, more of the fire retardant      than we like to see will wind up at the bottom of any space      filled with this insulation.    </p>    <p>      For this reason we tried grinding some cellulose all by      itself, putting it in a pile, and then sprinkling      controlled amounts of borax and aluminum sulfate across the      surfaces of the fiber. We were figuring, of course,      thatsince flames burn up-it would take less of the      chemicals to fireproof the pulverized insulation if those      chemicals were put on top of the cellulose, instead of      being allowed to sift to its bottom.    </p>    <p>      The idea seems to have merit and our propane torch tests      indicate that approximately another one cent in chemical      costs can be shaved off every square foot of 6"-thick attic      insulation with no reduction in fireproofing value when      this method of distributing the borax and aluminum sulfate      is used. That increases the saving on the cellulose fiber's      installation cost for 1,300-square-foot house from $253.50      to $266.50. Not a great additional saving, to be sure, but      one that you should know about.    </p>   <h3>INSTALLATION</h3>    <p>      MOTHER's homemade cellulose proved just as easy-no      more and no lessto install as its commercially available      counterpart. It's extremely easy to pour and spread around      between the joists and other structures of an attic. And      it's just as easy to add even more later, anytime you wish.    </p>    <p>      Putting the insulation into walls and other closed spaces      is somewhat more difficult. This usually requires that a      series of holes be drilled through a house's exterior      siding (or that some of the siding actually be removed) so      the material can be forced into the cavities with an      insulation blower. Building supply stores sometimes have      these blowers for rent ... and some clever      do-it-yourselfers have actually forced their cellulose into      walls with a hose attached to the exhaust end of a      heavyduty vacuum cleaner.    </p>    <p>      One final point: Any cellulose insulation-whether of      the store-bought or I-made-it-myself variety-will absorb      moisture when exposed to dampness of any kind. This, of      course, reduces the material's "R" value ... and cellulose      fibers should be used to insulate only those attics, walls,      crawl spaces, etc., that you know will remain dry.    </p>
