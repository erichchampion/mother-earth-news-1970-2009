                      <h5 id="byline">by HESTER CREED ROSE</h5>    <p>      Marion, my husband, needed a cart of some sort ...      something sturdy that he could attach to his garden tractor      and haul logs, firewood, and other heavy loads on. But      every cart built as husky as he wanted ... also carried a      heftier price than he wanted to pay.    </p>        <p>      And then one day he saw a wrecked Subaru on the Datsun lot      where he works, and Marion knew he'd found just what he      needed. A couple of his buddies helped him cut the back end      out of the automobile, add a tongue, and-in general-convert      the rear portion of the car into the trailer you see here.    </p>    <p>      Nope, it ain't much to look at ... but our "new" cart has      already hauled many tons of wood for us. We live on six      acres, mostly wooded, near the edge of town and our son      (Michael, the handsome guy in the photo) fells only dead      trees ... which he then saws into fuel for our fireplaces.      And the whole job-or at least the part about getting that      firewood to the house-is a great deal easier ...      thanks to an old Subaru.    </p>
