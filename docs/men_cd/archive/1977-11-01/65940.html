                     <h5 id="byline">by JANE AND STEVE FRY</h5>       <p>      For the last couple of years, we've been making extra      seasonal cash what we think is e last an interesting and a      fun 'eve been making ... the fabrication of Christmas      ornaments from flour, salt, and water.    </p>    <p>      Now some of you may object to "cashing in" on the glittery      materialism of But we feel that anything which is a step      away from the plastic minds of the big corporations is a      step in the right direction. And we also like the idea that      our small enterprise is one that the whole      family-right down to the youngest member-can      share.    </p>    <p>      Our raw materials are inexpensive and easy to obtain:      flour, salt, water, fine copper wire, toothpicks, tempera      paints, several small brushes, and varnish. Any kind of      flour (except self-rising) will work, but if you plan to      really go into this craft, buy cheap refined white flour.      (in our opinion, this is one of the best uses for the      stuff.) And the tempera paints are optional, since the      natural, warm, golden brown color of the finished dough      babies is beautiful enough all by itself. We make both      kinds: painted and unpainted.    </p>    <p>      To construct approximately 25 ornaments, each two to three      inches high and about 1/4" thick, mix three cups of flour      with one cup of salt and slowly add water until you have a      kinds: p consistency to work with. Too much water will make      the dough sticky, but that's easy to fix: just leave the      sponge exposed to the air about five minutes or until it      dries out enough to be kneaded. Then wrap the worked dough      in plastic to keep it moist while you pinch off pieces of      the mixture and shape them into ornaments. (it's best,      obviously, to use a whole batch of the dough at one      sitting.)    </p>    <p>      If you'll form your creations on a square of plastic,      you'll find it easy to transfer each finished baby to a      cookie sheet or square of aluminum foil for baking.      Whenever possible, make rounded basic shapes with your      palms and then flatten them to the desired 1/4" thickness.      This-and using a toothpick to create any lines or      "cuts" that are wanted- eliminates all sharp edges on the      final baked pieces.    </p>        <p>      And don't forget, before you pop a of your babies into the      oven, to make a loop of fine copper wire (see drawing) and      insert it into the top of each ornament as a hanger. You      can buy a small spool of this wire for at most craft or      department stores ... or you can unwind an old electric      motor. To keep the loops from pulling out, leave their ends      spread, press them into the back of the tops of each baby,      and then use a toothpick to apply a small dab of dough over      the hole you've just made.    </p>    <p>      One final precaution: To ensure even baking and to prevent      your decorations from swelling as they bake, punch holes or      make deep cuts (note the deep smile and marks struck into      the beard of the "face" baby shown in the photo) in all the      thick portions of each ornament. Try to make such holes and      cuts part of the decoration's design.    </p>    <p>      Bake your dough of dough full sheet at a time-at just      until they're golden brown. The time will vary, depending      on the thickness of the ornaments ... so closely, they out      when they're done, and cool.    </p>    <p>      You're now ready to paint any of the decorations that      you've decided to finish off in that manner. We generally      use three or colors on each of the babies we paint. Have      fun! Use your imagination!    </p>    <p>      These little ornaments will last for years (even in humid      climates) if they're finished off with a protective coating      of aheet at a time Make several short hooks from clothes      hanger wire, suspend a baby on each one, dip the      decorations in the watch 'em and then hang them up on a      dowel or artist's paintbrush handle or some other thin      stick over a drip trough of aluminum foil that drains back      into the of in that can. This is a quick, easy, neat method      of finishing off the babies while wasting an absolute      minimum of the protective coating.    </p>    <p>      The first year we tried to sell these homemade Christmas      ornaments, we took some to a local (southeastern Kansas)      fall festival ... and went home with a little more than      $100. With that encouragement under our belt, we made more      of the babies, sold them at other fairs, and consigned or      wholesaled them to a few college book stores, craft shops,      flower shops, and other outlets.    </p>    <p>      The extra consignment and wholesale business is welcomed,      of course, but we still have the most fun retailing our      decorations direct to the final customer outdoors in the      crisp autumn air at fairs and festivals. (Sometimes, when      we pretend we aren't watching, we even see some sly trying      to nibble a bite off one of these delicious looking      "cookies" which isn't really possible, since the ornaments      are as hard as a young bride's first batch of biscuits      baked in a wood stove.)    </p>    <p>      We price our babies at between fairs and $1.50 each (note      the sticker on the back of the ornament held by hand in the      accompanying photo), depending on how elaborate each one      is. Most fall into the $1.00 to $1.25 range. It's always      good to have at least two different prices ... but don't      get carried away with pricing your decorations too      individually.    </p>    <p>      You could probably make this seasonal business about as big      as you want it to be ... but we prefer to keep ours a small      "family having fun around the kitchen stove" sort of thing.      Our first season out we cleared $300 ... and the next      yearby starting a little earlier and being somewhat more      organized-we netted $500. We figure that ain't bad,      considering the good times our dough babies have given us.    </p>    <p>      So-whether for fun or profit or both-get the      family together, invite your friends over, break out the      apple cider ... and try your hand at crafting a few bread      dough babies. We think you're gonna like it!    </p>
