                          <p>      Copthorne Macdonald is the inventor of slow-scan television      . . . a method of amateur radio transmission that allows      ham operators to both hear and see each other during      shortwave broadcasts.    </p>   <h3> NDR WEST</h3>    <p>      New Directions Radio is alive and well on the West Coast!      Alternatives-oriented ham radio has definitely exceeded      "critical mass" proportions out West and appears to have      established a selfsustaining chain reaction. Randy Brink,      WA78KR (who-together with "So" Bogardus, W6HSE?puts out The      New Directions Roundtable Newsletter) claims much of the      credit for this ... he's been an active NDR promoter since      the early part of 1974. A while back, Randy and his wife,      Meta-who hail from Port Orchard, Washington -traveled      throughout the western U.S. in order to meet some of the      gang, andwith characteristic thoughfullness-took      pictures as they went. Here-to help the rest of us get      acquainted with "them that's doing"-are a few of Randy and      Meta's photos, along with some comments about what these      folks are up to.    </p>        <p>      Bo Bogardus (W6HSE), who currently lives in Berkeley,      California, is a retired military man whose interests are      now decidedly anti-military.    </p>    <p>      In addition to publishing The NDR Newsletter, Bo prints a      newsletter for the Women for Peace organization. He also      moderates the Sunday evening session of the Roundtable.    </p>        <p>      In Los Angeles, Randy (left) spent an enjoyable evening      with Bill Goodart, K6CSP (center) and Curt Barnes, WB6EUN      (right). Randy's three a and a half years in the military      helped sensitize him to matters of war and peace, too: He      is currently working with the Pacific Life Community in the      Trident submarine protest. In addition, Randy has been      active with a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group      called-of all things -New Directions, which is currently      focusing its efforts on the nuclear issue.    </p>        <p>      <br />      <br />      Bob Hickerson (WA6RRR) has been very active in New      Directions Radio<br />      right from the beginning. Last July,he hosted a "New      Directions Workshop"<br />      at his homestead in Yreka, California.    </p>              <p>      Ben Parks (WB6CTI) is seen here at his homestead in Helena,      California ... a homestead that Randy says Is one and a      half miles up?"like, wheel-spinning up!"?a dirt road. For      electricity, Ben uses a Pelton waterwheel coupled to an      automobile alternator to feed a continuous five amps of      current into a bank of ten batteries. Auto taillights      supplement kerosene lamps to provide light for Ben's place.    </p>    <p>      Cave Junction, Oregon Is the hometown of Jonnie Klein      (WB7NKC), whom Randy describes as a "dropout scientist" now      active with a tree-planting co-op called Green Side Up.      Among other things, Jonnie has been restoring old telephone      storage batteries for some of the homesteaders in the West      Coast NDR group.    </p>        <p>      After spending two years with Earthmind, Mark Dankoff      (WB6SMJ) has headed down to New Mexico, where he plans to      set up a homestead and continue his experiments with wind      power.    </p>   <h3>THE SIMPLE RECEIVER PROJECT</h3>    <p>      Our ongoing effort to come up with simple, inexpensive ham      gear has borne a little more fruit: I've worked out a way      to convert six. transistor pocket radios into very usable      oneband (3.5 to 4 MHz) ham receivers capable of picking up      both code and voice signals. Cost: As little as $10. A      how-to-do-it write-up?simple enough for a beginner to      comprehend, but detailed enough for the person with some      electronics experience to put to use-is available for 50c      from Randy Brink. You can write to Ran. dy at 1174 S.E.
