            		       <h3>AGRIBIZ SUFFERS DEFEAT IN WESTLANDS CASE</h3>    <p>      Corporate farming in the Westlands area of California      received a severe blow on August 19, 1977 when the Ninth      Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled (in a suit      brought by National Land for People) that the water from      federal water projects can't be used to irrigate any      California farms larger than 160 acres, except under      certain stringent conditions. This is the first time in the      history of the 1902 Reclamation Act that the      acreage-limitation portion of the statute has been enforced      in California (or anywhere else, for that matter). The      original intent of the law (see Friends of the Earth, page      123, MOTHER NO. 40) was to promote family farms and prevent      encroachment by agribiz.    </p>    <p>      Hot on the heels of the Ninth Circuit Court's landmark      decision was Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus's announcement      of proposed regulations to bring about the enforcement of      the 75-year-old law. The most significant part of Andrus's      proposal is his recommendation that only small farmers who      live on their own land be allowed to work the eleven      million acres that are presently irrigated by Bureau of      Reclamation projects in 17 Western States.    </p>    <p>      The Andrus program also calls for a two-year investigation      into the extent of violations of the Reclamation Act's      160-acre limitation. (BuRec records show that only      1,074,000 acres are presently being irrigated illegally,      but there are strong indications that the actual figure is      much greater than that.) Upon completion of the      investigation, violators would-at long last-be      required to sell off their holdings in excess of 160 acres      at per-acre prices comparable to those of nonirrigated land      in the same area. (BuRec would-as it has in the      pastreserve the right to approve or disapprove all prices.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, Secretary Andrus would like to see the      residency requirements of the 1902 Reclamation Act (which      state that farm owners must live within 50 miles of their      farms) be strictly enforced.    </p>    <p>      The ramifications of these two developments (the Ninth      Circuit Court's decision and Secretary Andrus's enforcement      program) are nothing less than earthshaking. The above turn      of events could very well-by opening up large tracts      of farmland for settlementtrigger a homesteading movement      unequaled since the days of Abraham Lincoln.    </p>    <p>      This is not to say that the battle is all over, however.      It's likely that-in the wake of the court decision      and the Interior Department's recent announcementmuch      clamoring will be heard in the nation's capital from the      board rooms of agribusiness.    </p>    <p>      What You Can Do: Your help is needed to assure that      Secretary Andrus gets the support he needs. Write to your      Representative in Congress (c/o The House of      Representatives, Washington, D.C. 20515) and urge his or      her support of Mr. Andrus's proposals.    </p>    <h3>FOE BRITAIN INSULATES HOMES, CREATES      JOBS</h3>    <p>      FOE Britain has found a way to help senior citizens save      money and stay warm, and create jobs in the process. It's      called the Durham Insulation Project ... a project      that-over the past two years-has resulted in [1] the      insulation of the homes of more than 4,000 residents of      Durham, England, [2] the creation of 15 jobs, and [3] the      stimulation of over 400 other insulation-related jobs      around the country.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Mark Hughes started the whole thing when he insulated a      retiree's loft in Durham back in late 1975. Subsequent      appeals to the Department of Energy succeeded in Mark's      getting funding (through the Job Creation Programme) for 15      jobs.    </p>    <p>      There are indications, too, that the project is      snowballing: In August of last year, England's Department      of the Environment sent proposals for job-creating      insulation schemes to local authorities and acknowledged      the pioneer work done by FOE Durham.    </p>    <p>      The FOE group-besides publicizing their project via a      number of pamphlets and articles, and working to get local      governments to support insulation-related job      projects-has created a strong bond with England's      labor organizations. Trade union support, in fact, helped      FOE's Insulation Project get two major grants to insulate      the homes of senior citizens and disabled people.    </p>    <p>      We hope others will follow the Durham group's example and      help make more homes energy-efficient while-at the      same time-doing something positive about the      unemployment problem.    </p>   <h3>WORLD'S LARGEST NUCLEAR PROTEST HELD IN      SPAIN</h3>    <p>      Last July 13, some 200,000 people marched in Bilbao, Spain      in the world's largest anti-nuclear protest to date,      according to Intercontinental Press. Workers, youths,      children, Basque separatists, women's groups, and members      of most of Spain's political parties marched in an all-day      demonstration unmarred by violence.    </p>    <p>      Neighborhood associations throughout the greater Bilbao      area organized the demonstration (the first legal one in a      year) to protest plans to transform the Basque coast into a      nuclear zone, and specifically to demand that construction      of the Iberduero nuclear plant (in nearby Lemoniz) be      brought to a halt.    </p>    <p>      The marchers-borrowing slogans from the antinuclear      movements in Switzerland, France, Germany, and the      U.S.-shouted "Let the people vote on nuclear      plants!", "We want gardens, not nukes!", and "Better active      now than radioactive tomorrow!    </p>   <h3> NEWSBRIEFS</h3>    <p>      French local authorities have released the results of a      study of pollution conditions at 777 beaches. Their      findings: Under French guidelines, one beach in four should      have been closed at certain times in 1975 and '76, and one      in 20 should be closed permanently .... Acid rain is      killing millions of fish in southern Norway's lakes. The      Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has      named Great Britain as the major source of the problem: the      British Isles emit 2.8 million tons of SO2 gas (which-in      the presence of water-becomes sulfuric acid) into the      air each year .... The FDA has joined with the USDA in      asking for new studies of the cancer-causing chemicals      known as nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are by-products of the      nitrates and nitrites used to preserve bacon, sausage, and      other cured meats. Bacon lovers, beware!    </p>    <p>      <em>To become a member of Friends of the Earth-and      receive their excellent publication, Not Man Apart, year      round-remit $20 to FOE at 124 Spear, San Francisco, Calif.      94105. - MOTHER.</em>    </p>
