                         <p>      Carrot juice-as you know-is a very healthful      and tasty drink. If you've ever made this beverage      yourself, however, you've probably been amazed at how much      pulp is left over after putting a few carrots through the      juicer. The question is, what can you do with all those      solids?    </p>    <p>      Until last year, the carrot pulp from my kitchen went      straight to the compost heap (along with other kitchen      scraps). But then I started thinking what a shame it was to      have to waste all that food. After all, it was still orange      ... which meant it was almost certainly still loaded with      carotene (a vitamin A precursor) and other nutrients.      "Wouldn't it be great," I mused, "if there were some way to      put all that nutrition back into the family diet?"    </p>    <p>      Without further ado, I started to research some old recipes      that seemed suited to my purpose ... and-after many      hours in the kitchen (which is not my normal domain) and      many failures-I finally came up with recipes for      three surprisingly good carrot-pulp creations: a marmalade,      a cake-like bread, and cookies:    </p>   <h3>CARROT PULP MARMALADE</h3>    <p>      3 oranges<br />      4 cups of water<br />      3 cups of carrot pulp<br />      4 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />      3 cups of honey<br />      1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger<br />      1 package of store-bought dried pectin    </p>    <p>      Peel all three oranges and cut the rinds into very narrow      slices. Cook the slices in four cups of water until they're      tender ... then let 'em sit at least seven hours (or      overnight).<br />    </p>    <p>      Once the peelings have had a chance to stand for seven (or      more) hours, add the carrot pulp to them and boil for 10      minutes. Next, chop the oranges into a bowl and remove all      seeds. Then introduce the oranges, lemon juice, honey, and      ginger to the pulp/peelings mixture and boil for 20 minutes      more.    </p>    <p>      If-after 20 minutes-the marmalade has begun to jell      on its own ... terrific! Pour the mixture into hot, sterile      canning jars and seal. Otherwise-if the jam hasn't      thickened-you should stir in the dried pectin at this      point. (I don't know why, but sometimes you'll need the      pectin and sometimes you won't. All I can say is, when in      doubt . . . use the pectin.) Boil the pectin-enriched      marmalade for another 10 minutes, stirring constantly.      Remove from heat, but continue to stir for an additional      seven minutes. Finally, pour the marmalade into hot,      sterile canning jars and seal.    </p>   <h3>CARROT PULP BREAD</h3>    <p>      2/3 cup of vegetable oil<br />      3/4 cup of honey<br />      2 eggs<br />      1-1 /2 cups of carrot pulp<br />      1-1 /2 cups of whole wheat flour<br />      1 teaspoon of cinnamon<br />      1 teaspoon of baking soda<br />      1 teaspoon of sea salt (optional)<br />    </p>    <p>      Mix the oil and honey together as well as you can, then add      the eggs and mix again. Stir in the carrot pulp. Now add      the remaining ingredients and mix well ... pour the      resulting concoction into a greased loaf pan (measuring      approximately 8-1/2" X 4-1/2" X 2-5/8") ... and bake in a      pre-heated 350°F oven for 60 to 65 minutes.    </p>   <h3> CARROT PULP COOKIES</h3>    <p>      3/4 cup of water<br />      1 cup of carrot pulp<br />      2/3 cup of vegetable oil<br />      2/3 cup of honey<br />      1 egg<br />      2 cups of whole wheat flour<br />      2 teaspoons of baking powder<br />      1/ 2 teaspoon of sea salt (optional)<br />      1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract<br />      1/2 teaspoon of pure lemon extract<br />    </p>    <p>      Add the water to the carrot pulp in a small saucepan and      cook over a very low heat for 10 minutes, stirring often to      keep the pulp from scorching. Meanwhile, beat the oil and      honey together in a bowl, then beat in the egg. Stir in the      cooked carrot pulp, the flour, the baking powder,      and-if you wish-the sea salt. Add the vanilla and      lemon extracts, stir, and spoon the dough out onto a      greased cookie sheet. Bake 12 to 15 minutes in a pre-heated      400°F oven. Happy eating!    </p>
