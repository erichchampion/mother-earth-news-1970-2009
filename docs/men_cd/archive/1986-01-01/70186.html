                    <h3>      Good News For Elephants    </h3>    <p>      Texas chemist Orlando Battista has discovered a way to make      synthetic ivory. By mixing microcrystalline cellulose,      calcium phosphate, and a special gelatin and then letting      the concoction dry at room temperature for ten weeks, the      scientist produces a material that he claims is virtually      indistinguishable from real ivory and "has essentially the      same chemical composition as elephant tusk." (No word yet      on whether Battista has any tower-building plans.)    </p>    <h3>      Pesticides Getting Panned    </h3>    <p>      Each year 750,000 people are poisoned by pesticides; of      these, 14,000 die. Studies indicate that the rate of      poisonings in the Third World is 13 times as great as in      the U.S.    </p>    <p>      Following the dictum "think globally, act locally," the      Pesticide Action Network (PAN) is coordinating local      organizing efforts around the world to try to limit the      unnecessary spread of these dangerous chemicals. One of the      primary goals of the group is to "end the double standard      in the worldwide pesticide trade which allows pesticides      that are banned in developed countries (because of their      documented health hazards) to be routinely exported to the      Third World."    </p>    <p>      PAN's international "Dirty Dozen" campaign seeks to end the      use of 12 extremely hazardous pesticides wherever their      safe use cannot be ensured. The organization is using      techniques tailored to each individual country's culture to      spread the message. In Indonesia, farmers are traveling      from hamlet to hamlet to tell others about natural methods      of pest control. Brazilian groups have staged street      theater, dressing up as the offensive pesticides to warn      local farmers about the lethal potential of the poisons.      And in Britain, posters and billboards proclaim,    </p>    <p>      "These days there are enough pesticides in vegetables to      turn you into one!"    </p>    <p>      If you would like to "act locally" and organize a Dirty      Dozen campaign in your own neighborhood, PAN will send you      an information packet (including technical data, an      overview of the pesticide trade, alternative pest-control      methods, posters, and more) for $10.00 postpaid. To order      the packet-or for more information about hazardous      pesticides and the PAN organization-write to Pesticide      Education and Action Project, 1045 Sansome St., Rm. 404,      San Francisco, CA 94111.    </p>    <h3>Sheep Labor</h3>        <p>      Sheep may be the solution to the Malaysian rubber      industry's weed woes. Over half of the country's cultivated      land is planted in rubber trees, and the current cost of      controlling the weeds that grow beneath those trees is      between $100 and $150 million a yearwith a large portion of      that going for chemical herbicides. But Sahabat Alam      Malaysia (Friends of the Earth Malaysia) sends the      encouraging news that, in an ongoing experiment, sheepkept      under the trees with solar-powered electric fences-      have been doing a commendable job of devouring the      high-protein weeds and saving the rubbergrowers money, too.    </p>    <h3>      Sweet Greens    </h3>    <p>      If the new artificial sweeteners leave a bad taste in your      mouth, perhaps you should do as the Aztecs did: Try Lippis      dulcis. International Wildlife reports that this recently      rediscovered plant-a native of the American      tropics-has leaves and flowers said to be 1,000 times      sweeter than sucrose! It's nontoxic and has no known side      efects and few calories. Two companies are currently      looking into its possible use in toothpaste and mouthwash.    </p>    <h3>      Who's the Boss?    </h3>    <p>      More and more Americans can point to themselves in response      to that question. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports      that nine million of us were self-employed in      1984-that's up 33% since 1970!    </p>    <h3>      Children and Handguns    </h3>    <p>      One child a day dies from a handgun accident, and guns are      now the fifth leading cause of death in children. Children      account for more than 30% of firearm deaths in the home.      These grim statistics were presented last fall at the      annual meeting of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry,      and clearly point out the need to educate America's adults      in better handgun safety and storage.    </p>    <h3>      Are Things Really Looking "Yup"?    </h3>    <p>      The world according to Madison Avenue has the entire baby      boom generation made up of Yuppies-young urban      professionals. But-as a recent article in Money      magazine points out-in the real world, of the 55      million Americans between the ages of 25 and 39, only 12      million have professional or managerial jobs; of these,      only 3.8 million live in urban areas. Thus, 93% of the      country's young are disqualified from Yuppiedom (a      banishment which is probably just fine with most of them).    </p>    <p>      The sad truth behind the media myth can be seen in these      Census Bureau statistics. While the real median income for      all American adults dropped 3% from 1979 to 1983, that of      25- to 34 year-olds dropped 13% in the same time period . .      . nothing upwardly mobile about that.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, it doesn't look as if that trend will take a turn      for the better anytime soon. A story in The New York Times      reports that the number of Americans under the age of 18      who live in proverty has risen from 14.3% 15 years ago to      22% today. The article claims this new class of poor      Americans is "younger, less educated, and likely to give      birth sooner than recent generations of the poor." Little      wonder it called their prospects of advancing "dim."    </p>    <h3>      Seeing the Light    </h3>    <p>      About a year and a half ago, we reported the U.S.      Department of Agriculture's warning that hydrilla-a      weed native to central Africa-was infesting rivers,      lakes, and streams from Southern California to Maryland.      The USDA now thinks that it's possible to control hydrilla      by exposing it to low-level lighting for one hour at night.      The light interrupts the critical periods of darkness that      the plant requires in order to form tubers and reproduce.      The technique is currently being tested in the Potomac      River.    </p>
