                <p>      Here's the sixteenth in a series of articles that will help      you tell friend from foe in your garden.<br />    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Ron West    </h5>        <p>      Let's imagine ahead a couple of months to early spring.      It's planting time, and an enthusiastic organic gardener      has just set out a beautiful assortment of tender young      seedlings. Her work done, she stands back and proudly      surveys the newly planted veggie patch-and sleeps soundly      that night with visions of mature cabbages, tomatoes, and      peppers dancing in her head.    </p>    <p>      The shock comes next morning when our hopeful backyard      farmer steps out the door to admire her new garden, only to      find several of her freshly transplanted seedlings lying      prone and lifeless, their stems severed at or near ground      level.    </p>    <h3>      Cutworms.    </h3>    <p>      Unlike the nibbling attacks launched by most other garden      insect pests, cutworm damage-immediate and irrevocable-is      fatal. to seedlings. And just one lonely cutworm can      destroy several plants in a single night's foray.    </p>    <p>      Most cutworms are gray, brown, or black, sometimes with      spots or stripes. They average about an inch long, tend to      curl up when disturbed, and, after the better part of two      summers spent in the destructive larval form, become      harmless, nectar-drinking owlet moths (family Noctuidae),      commonly known as millers.    </p>    <p>      For the sake of scientific convenience, the 20,000 or so      species of cutworms are frequently divided according to      feeding habits into four primary groups: surface feeders,      tunnel makers, subterranean cutworms, and climbers.    </p>    <p>      Of the four, the surface feeders are the variety most often      associated with the name cutworm, because they neatly slice      through the stems of plants near ground level. Even more      destructive, though, are the tunnel makers, since they      often sever the stems of many more plants than they eat.      Unlike the first two groups, subterranean cutworms live      almost entirely below ground.    </p>    <p>      The final class of cutworms, the climbers, differ from the      other three categories of Noctuidae larvae in that they      inflict most of their damage, not to a plant's stem, but      rather to its leaves. The most destructive variety of      climbing cutworm is the armyworm, a brightly striped moth      larva that often attacks gardens and farm fields in      battalion strength, destroying the hard-won produce of      human labor in short order.    </p>    <h3>      How to stop them?    </h3>    <p>      To fight those varieties of cutworms that sever the stems      of seedlings, simply make up a batch of stif cardboard      plant collars-each 2" to 3" high-pressing one a half inch      or so into the soil around each seedling at transplant      time. You can also employ small tin cans for this purpose,      though my personal choice is to cut 3"-long sections of      4"diameter plastic drainpipe, forming collars that will      protect seedlings from hungry field mice, as well.    </p>    <p>      While collars may also provide a modicum of protection      against climbing cutworms, the wise gardener won't count on      this defense. These acrobatic pests are best controlled by      methodically plucking them off your plants by hand and then      destroying them by foot . . . or by treating your garden      with Bacillus thuringiensis.    </p>    <p>      Cutworms can also be at least partially controlled by      encouraging the presence of natural predators and parasites      in your garden. Birds love to scratch the ground looking      for these plump morsels; ground beetles-those black or      brown, somewhat flattened beetles that live under stones      and debris-hunt cutworms at night and can put a sizable      dent in their numbers; and the tiny wasp Trichogramma      minutum deposits its eggs among the eggs of the cutworm      moth so that the newly hatched wasp larvae can feed upon      the embryos inside the unhatched moth eggs.    </p>    <p>      Also, since the owlet moths most often deposit their eggs      in ground debris, cleaning your garden area of weeds and      mulch each autumn will help minimize cutworm damage the      following spring by reducing the number of miller larvae      hatching in and near your vegetable patch.    </p>    <p>      Finally, deep plowing or tilling, combined with slightly      delayed planting in the spring, can be a highly effective      deterrent to cutworm infestation. The tilling will destroy      a great many hibernating (second season) cutworms, while      simultaneously removing the tender young weed seedlings      that any newly hatched survivors of the tilling will need      to nurse them through their first few days of life.    </p>    <p>      As our hypothetical horticulturist discovered, cutworms are      among the most destructive of garden pests. But, by      combining commonsense organic battle tactics with tenacity,      the little blighters can be defeated.    </p>
