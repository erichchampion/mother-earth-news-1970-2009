        LEFT: MARCH 1985: Bob waters his carefully tended super-early tomato crop inside MOTHER'S selfreliant homestead. If you look closely, you'll see that the tray in front of Kornegay contains his justsprouted spring brassica seedlings . . . yet the tomatoes are almost a foot tall! MIDDLE: APRIL 1985: By now-a month before they'll be set out- each tomato has its own two-gallon pot. Bob buries the containers in his (heated) greenhouse soil to help keep the plants' roots warm. (The red ball in the foreground is part of a sail thermometer.) RIGHT: MAY 1985: Since the plants are being started indoors away from pollinating insects, Bob has to handpollinate any blossoms that appear. Fortunately, this is an easy task . . . all it requires is regularly vibrating each flower with a pencil or small brush.
