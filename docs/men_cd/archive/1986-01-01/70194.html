                    <p>      <em>How would you like to enjoy your own vine-ripped      beauties weeks ahead of anyone else?</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Bob Kornegay    </h5>    <p>      What do the Kentucky Derby and the tomato have in common?      That's easy: big stakes for those who come in first. Or, at      times, big <em>steaks</em> -during my first year      working at MOTHER, I won a steak dinner for growing the      earliest ripe tomato at the Eco-Village. Now, I admit I      used devious tactics in that contest: I grew a Sub Arctic      Plenty (fast-maturing but pitiful-tasting) and stressed the      vine into premature production by raising it in a five-inch      pot. The poor plant bore only two fruits, but as far as I      was concerned, the prize dinner-and beating the other      staff gardeners-was reward enough for my efforts.    </p>    <p>      You may not be planning on making any garden wagers this      year yourself, but I'm sure you've tasted enough orange      baseballs-excuse me, supermarket      tomatoes-already this winter to be longing for that      first precious vine-ripened fruit. Tomatoes are without a      doubt the one garden crop worth taking the time and trouble      to bring in early. And early tomato harvesting may be more      than a matter of culinary craving. In some areas planning      for an early payoff may mean the difference between ever      tasting a real tomato and being permanently stuck with      grocery store globes . . . while down in the Deep South,      starting early might give you a good harvest before the      weather gets too hot for the plants to set fruit. In      addition, I like to start my heirloom varieties early so I      can get their harvest before the summer heat and humidity      promote verticillium wilt in those disease-susceptible      specimens.    </p>    <p>      Whatever your reasons, the following tips should help you      do the trick. Now, I'll admit that breeding a crop of      super-early tomatoes will require extra horticultural      effort, but, believe me, it can be done. (And you don't      have to have a greenhouse, either!)    </p>    <h3>      JUMPING THE GUN: READY...    </h3>    <p>      The process starts in the middle of winter. Since you'll be      growing plants indoors under less than optimum conditions      (less light and lower temperatures), you can expect each      growing stage to progress somewhat more slowly than normal.      In our western North Carolina mountain climate (zone 6), I      start my "super earlies" between late December and      mid-January.    </p>    <p>      You'll almost certainly be starting your tomatoes from      seed-what nursery carries transplants in the middle      of winter? But that's all to the good, since it'll enable      you to carefully select the variety you want to grow. Of      course, that choice will be a matter of personal      preference, but, in my opinion, if you're going to go to      all the trouble of nursing a special tomato crop, you      should give flavor a high priority. Thus, I wouldn't go for      a supershort-season variety like Siberia: It comes in      early, all right, but it doesn't taste good. On the other      hand, you probably don't want to go for a long-season,      giant, indeterminate specimen, either: Save the Big Boys      for the main summer crop.    </p>    <p>      My own palate-pleasing choices are Small Fry VFN (60 days:      widely available-actually, this good-sized bush      variety is the only hybrid tomato I grow anymore), Tiny Tim      (55 days: from W. Atlee Burpee Co., Riverside, CA 92502;      Clinton, IA 52732; Warminster, PA 18974), Tappy's Finest      (77 days: from Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, P.O. Box      158, North Garden, VA 22959), and a compact beefsteak like      Bush Beefsteak (62 days: from Alberta Nurseries &      Seeds, Ltd., Box 20, Bowden, Alberta, Canada TOM 0K0). The      first two are relatively fast-growing, while the last two      have larger fruits. Just grow one or two plants of each      variety you pick; you'll get plenty of other tomatoes with      your main crop later on .    </p>        <h3>      ...SET...    </h3>    <p>      Your plants will require at least eight hours of good light      a day, so plan to keep them near a good-sized south-facing      window, in a small sunspace, or under a good grow light      (such as the type commonly used for African violets).    </p>    <p>      Start your seeds in a flat, a 6" pot, or a 10" hanging      basket. You can buy a good nursery mix or create your own.      (I recommend a mix of five parts leaf mold, milled sphagnum      moss, or peat moss; four parts good topsoil; and two parts      sharp sand. You can add one to two parts compost if you      wish.) Your mix must have good texture to withstand the      compaction caused by constant watering. In fact, if you      intend to keep your plants in containers to maturity, you      should definitely use a good commercial potting soil-which      is specially prepared to stay loose and porous-or      follow the advice I gave last issue in my article "Organic      Container Growing."    </p>    <h3>. . . GROW!</h3>    <p>      Once your seeds have germinated and set out their first      true leaves, prick the seedlings out to a slightly deeper      flat or put each one in a 6" pot. (Place some extra compost      and crushed eggshells, for calcium, in the bottom of the      container before transplanting.)    </p>    <p>      Keep your plants warm; the nighttime temperature should get      no lower than 55Â°F. Heat tape under the bottom of your      pot or flat can be a big help. And keep them well watered:      Container-grown tomatoes tend to get very thirsty.    </p>    <p>      When your plants are fairly well developed-wider than      they are tall, with healthy, thick stems-they're      ready to be moved to yet another, larger container. At this      point, they should be about the same size as (or slightly      bigger than) the greenhouse starts people buy at garden      stores. The main difference will be that your plants should      reach this stage a month or more before your last frost      date, instead of a week or two after!    </p>    <p>      Your young vines may now even have some flowers. If you're      growing super dwarfs like Tiny Tim and Pixie (52 days:      Thompson and Morgan, Inc., P.O. Box 100, Farmingdale, NJ      07727), you can leave the blooms alone; but if you're      raising larger varieties, remove those premature blossoms.    </p>    <p>      You'll move any dwarf cultivars to 8" or 10" final pots and      the larger ones to 2-gallon containers. Either way, add      some crushed eggshells, compost, and supplemental      fertilizer to your soil mix (I like Earthrite C, available      from Zook & Ranck, Rt. 1, Gap, PA 17527) and place some      extra shells and compost in the bottom of each pot. Plant      your two-gallon vines deeply to encourage extra root      development.    </p>    <p>      Determinate varieties will soon start making lots of      blossoms. Help them to set fruit by gently vibrating each      flower with a pencil or small brush. (Tomatoes are      self-pollinating; the shaking will help the pollen grains      inside a bloom's anther reach the flower's stigmaand hence,      ovary.) Try to treat each bract of flowers, especially if      your plants are indoors, where pollinating insects can't      get to them. You should do this once a day, preferably      between about 11:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M.    </p>    <p>      You'll also need to stake your indeterminate plants. I use      a 3/4" X 1" X 36" stick, inserted to the bottom of the pot      along one side.    </p>    <h3>      THE FINAL SPOT</h3>            <p>      What you'll do next will depend on where you want your      plants' final homes to be. If you're going to keep them in      containers, just continue what you've been doing. You'll      probably want to fertilize the soil-not the      foliage-regularly with a weak seaweed, fish, manure,      or compost solution. (And if you're desperate to hasten      their ripening, you can do a little root pruning when      several green fruits are close to being ripe: Cut a third      or half circle seven inches deep into the soil about three      inches out from the stem.)    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if you're going to move your plants to      your regular garden, you'll need to harden them off. Most      likely, by this time the weather will be warm enough for      you to set out the pots in a protected spot on the south      side of your house during the day and bring them in at      night. About ten days before transplanting, start exposing      the vines to some cooler night air-but bring them in if      there's a possibility of frost! You can put them in the      ground for good immediately after your area's last frost      date (though it's better to wait a week or two longer).    </p>    <p>      All these tips will definitely help you raise an early      crop, but you can push your tomato harvest up even further      if you make a few special efforts. Essentially, anything      you can do to warm up that cold spring soil will help. So      keep your plants near a south wall (especially a      light-reflecting white wall) . . . lay black plastic across      their growing bed to help heat the ground . . . or put      corrugated plastic or a homemade cloche over them.    </p>    <p>      The same low-cost cloches Susan Glaese and I recommended in      issue 95 for fall greens (in our article "Extending the      Season") work wonderfully for protecting spring tomatoes.      In fact, I built a south-facing, cloched rock bed at      MOTHER's self-reliant homestead for just such purposes. (I      also use it to grow allwinter spinach and extra-early      Chinese cabbage.) Last spring, I put my tomatoes straight      in that plant shelter two weeks after the last frost      date-the bed was so well sheltered that the 'maters never      needed hardening off!    </p>    <h3>      BLT BLISS</h3>    <p>      They say that here in these hills, you're doing good if you      have any ripe tomatoes by the Fourth of July. Last summer,      we ate our first bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches on      June 14. And those were made with good, ripe tomatoes!    </p>    <p>      You know, you can't beat red, vine-ripened tomatoes. And,      with a little work, you can ear them a lot earlier than you      ever expected to!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: A good in-depth book on tomato horticulture      is Ortho's All About Tomatoes, available for $5.95 plus      $1.00 shipping and handling from Ortho Information      Services, 742 Bancroft Way Berkeley, CA 94710.    </p>

If you look closely, you'll see that the tray in front of Kornegay contains his justsprouted spring brassica seedlings . . . yet the tomatoes are almost a foot tall! MIDDLE: APRIL 1985: By now-a month before they'll be set out- each tomato has its own two-gallon pot. Bob buries the containers in his (heated) greenhouse soil to help keep the plants' roots warm. (The red ball in the foreground is part of a sail thermometer.) RIGHT: MAY 1985: Since the plants are being started indoors away from pollinating insects, Bob has to handpollinate any blossoms that appear. Fortunately, this is an easy task . . . all it requires is regularly vibrating each flower with a pencil or small brush.
