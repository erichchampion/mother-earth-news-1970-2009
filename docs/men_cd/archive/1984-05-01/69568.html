                <p>      <em>Our agricultural industry is converting to a new and      (on the surface, at least) better method.</em>    </p>            <p>      To many people, no-tillage farming appears to be a      tremendous step forward for agriculture. At a time when      fertile topsoil is being worn away by wind and water at      rates that are figured in tons per acre per year, a drastic      new soil-conservation measure is certainly in order. And as      you're about to see, no-till <em>does</em> preserve      topsoil, but this advantage doesn't come without certain      trade-offs. As it's currently practiced in the U.S.,      no-till farming might more appropriately be called      no-till/chemical agriculture.<br />      <br />      <strong>WHAT IS NO-TILL FARMING?</strong><br />      <br />      In conventional tillage, the earth is turned to a depth of      8 to 12 inches with a plow, most commonly one of the      moldboard variety. Subsequently, the plot is disked at      least twice more to prepare the seedbed before planting      takes place. In no-till, however, the first three steps in      conventional cultivation are dispensed with. Planting is      done right <em>through</em> the residues of previous      plantings and weeds with a device (usually a coulter) that      cuts a slot a few inches wide, followed by equipment that      places the seeds and closes the trench. There's much more      of a difference between these two agricultural techniques      than three passes over the field, though, so let's look      into the rationale of each method.<br />      <br />      <strong>WHY NO-TILL?</strong><br />      <br />      In the first paragraph of the landmark 1943 book      <em>Plowman's Folly</em> , Edward H. Faulkner said, "The      truth is that no one has ever advanced a scientific reason      for plowing." Nonetheless, 40 years after that publication      cracked the foundations of agricultural science, most      farmers still plow. Why?<br />      <br />      The most obvious (or at least the most frequently      <em>claimed</em> ) reason that soil is tilled is to loosen      it so oxygen and water can reach the area where roots will      grow. It seems logical that friable, loose earth would      allow roots to spread evenly and to proliferate, and this      is indeed the case. But using a moldboard plow doesn't      necessarily produce such soil. Plowing and disking a field      results in a soil with broken structure lying atop a      heavily compressed plow pan (the undisturbed layer that the      plow doesn't reach). This broken-up soil is very prone to      being compacted by rainfall. In addition, many passes must      be made over the field with very heavy equipment, the      wheels of which further compress the soil. Untilled ground      <em>starts off</em> being less compacted than a heavily      machine-worked field, and it <em>stays</em> that way.      What's more, earth that has become compressed by tillage or      machinery will return to a less compacted state after a few      years of no-till planting.<br />      <br />      Plowing, it is claimed, incorporates fertilizers and crop      residues into the soil, making nutrients readily available      to the roots of the plants. Turning organic matter under      also has the benefit of preventing planters from becoming      fouled with surface trash. In no-till farming, crop      residues are left on the surface, where the nutrients that      result from their decay can leach into the soil. This      leaching process is far more thorough than you might      imagine. Fertilizers-including anhydrous ammonia,      phosphorus, and potassium-are at least as effective      on the no-till fields where they've been dispersed as on      the plowed plots. And with the right equipment, these      ingredients can be placed directly into the planting trench      (where they're most needed) during seeding. As for the      potential problem of the planter fouling with residues,      specially designed no-till planters have a device that cuts      a slot through surface trash. Besides, studies have shown      that the accumulation of this surface material levels off      after a few seasons of no-till practice.<br />      <br />      Of course, conventional plowing does prepare a seedbed.      No-till farming also does this . . . but in a much more      restrained way. In normal tillage, the entire field is      turned into a seedbed that may be mounded for planting.      With no-till, one simply prepares a narrow trench of the      appropriate depth. Studies have shown that plant roots      develop at least as well in a no-till field as in a plowed      one and that the lack of mounding exposes less of the soil      to air and evaporation.<br />      <br />      Conventional plowing is also done across the contours of      the land to prevent soil erosion. But once again, this      rationale doesn't hold up when you look at the results      possible with no-till. The crop residues on a no-till field      prevent runoff to an amazing extent: On slopes that are      steeper than can normally be planted, no-till fields have      consistently shown next to no topsoil loss after downpours      of several inches per hour. That same vegetative cover also      makes the no-till field less susceptible to the effects of      wind erosion. This type of agriculture truly offers a      solution to the problem of topsoil loss.<br />      <br />      A fringe (but certainly not insignificant) benefit of the      retention of runoff is that no-till soils stay more moist      than those in tilled fields. The surface residues trap      water and protect the earth below from the evaporative      effect of the wind. In the West, where adequate spring      moisture depends largely on snowmelt, the vegetative cover      helps keep the snow from blowing away. The advantages don't      end there, though. If you grimaced a few paragraphs back      when we mentioned anhydrous ammonia, consider this: One of      the main problems with conventional agriculture's heavy use      of nitrogen fertilizers is the leaching of these compounds      into surface water during runoff. By retaining rainfall,      the untilled field also better holds the chemicals that      have been applied to it, thereby decreasing their pollution      potential.<br />      <br />      The list of environmental benefits that no-till farming      boasts over conventional practices goes on and on. But      beyond its ability to create a more natural soil that      retains nutrients and water, prevents soil erosion, and      compacts less, the no-till technique offers a number of      immediate financial advantages to the farmer. Not only are      the number of trips over the field cut by at least three      (thereby saving fuel and wear and tear on tractors), but      fewer pieces of equipment are needed. Plows, cultivators,      and disk harrows become obsolete. And because the no-till      planter can be pulled by a smaller tractor than is required      to drag a disk or plow, money can be saved on the size of      this piece of equipment, as well.<br />      <br />      Yields are generally at least as good with no-till      agriculture as they are with plow techniques. Though the      soil does stay cooler until a little later in the spring      because of the insulating layer of residue, the day/night      soil temperature fluctuations are smaller. A no-till field      rapidly makes up its deficit in growth rate as the weather      turns warm. And if the summer should be really hot and dry,      no-till yields will nearly always exceed those of plowed      ground. Since soil moisture levels can be more than 10%      higher in late July in an unplowed piece of ground, it's      not surprising that plants are happier in a field covered      with mulch.<br />      <br />      In short, the more one looks into the justifications for      conventional agricultural practices, the more one realizes      that there really isn't much sound defense for tillage.      There is, however, one more point that plow advocates raise      to defend the technique, and it's one that poses a real      problem for people with strong environmental leanings:      Cultivation is the way in which conventional agriculture      controls weeds, both before and after planting. In no-till      farming, at least as it's practiced today;      <em>herbicides</em> take the place of the plow.<br />      <br />      <strong>SPRAY IT</strong><br />      <br />      In 1982, about 275 million acres of U.S. cropland were      sprayed with 360 million pounds of active herbicidal      ingredients. Twenty years ago, before the advent of no-till      agriculture, the numbers were only tiny fractions of these      figures.<br />      <br />      Herbicides supersede the three preplant passes that the      practitioner of tillage must make over the field.      Chemicals, instead of plows and disks, wipe out the      existing weeds and may be used to either kill or suppress      growth of the sod cover crop that seeds will be planted      into. They may be used again to control weeds before the      plants come up, in the form of a <em>preemergence</em>      chemical that's either applied at planting, sprayed from      land-based equipment, or dropped from the air. Later, after      the residual effect of the preemergence herbicide has      disappeared, postemergence chemicals may be applied to      control weeds between the rows. Then too, a herbicide may      be used to wipe out inter-row interlopers before a second      cropping.<br />      <br />      Of course, farmers use herbicides on <em>tilled</em>      ground, too. At the very least, though, the no-till      farmer's use of herbicides will equal that of conventional      practice. More often, unfortunately, significantly      <em>more</em> herbicides are used in no-till farming than      are typically applied to tilled ground. And in some cases,      where crop residues harbor insect pests, the use of      insecticides may be greater, as well. What does this mean      for our health and that of the land? Let's look further      into herbicides to see.<br />      <br />      <strong>HOW DO HERBICIDES WORK?</strong><br />      <br />      Modern weed control really had its beginnings in 1945, when      2,4-D was introduced. Prior to that time, the laborious      practice of controlling weeds with chemicals had been      accomplished with inorganic materials such as borax and      arsenic trioxide. But this new breed of synthetic organic      chemicals, of which 2,4-D was - and still is -      the most widely used, allowed success with quantities that      were mere fractions of the amounts of inorganics that had      previously been required to do the job. Obviously, the new      herbicides were a real breakthrough in concentrated      toxicity.<br />      <br />      Broadly speaking, herbicides can be divided into two major      categories: selective and nonselective. The first group can      be used, in the proper concentration, to kill one type of      plant without harming another. The latter group is      generally used to sweep a field clean of whatever is      growing there. Typically, a nonselective herbicide such as      paraquat might be used after the harvest in the fall or      before planting in the spring to kill weeds, sod, or a      cover crop. A selective herbicide such as 2,4-DB might be      used to combat weeds around a growing crop. If applied in      the proper concentration, the 2,4-DB won't affect the crop      plants, because they lack a certain enzyme that processes      the chemical. The weeds, however, will be able to convert      the 2,4-DB into deadly 2,4-D. The weeds' enzymatic      versatility thus proves to be fatal.    </p>        <p>      Herbicides can be further divided into groups according to      the route by which they attack. <em>Contact</em> herbicides      kill a plant by destroying its surface cellular structure.      Paraquat, for example, is a desiccant; that is, it robs      moisture from the weed, killing it within a couple of days.      <em>Translocated</em> herbicides actually enter a plant's      vascular system - either through the foliage after      direct spraying or through the roots after ground      application - and disrupt one of its life processes.      2,4-D, an auxin-type herbicide, accelerates growth to the      point that the plant dies. Atrazine, which is nearly as      popular as 2,4-D, attacks chlorophyll production in a weed,      limiting its ability to take nourishment from the sun.      Dalapon, another widely used herbicide, interferes with the      activity of a B vitamin called pantothenic acid which is      essential to a plant's development. Others take such      avenues of attack as halting the formation of amino acids,      preventing the production of sugar and complex starches,      and so on. There are nearly as many ways of killing weeds      as there are herbicides.<br />      <br />      <strong>WHAT SHOULD WE WORRY ABOUT?</strong><br />      <br />      <strong>Toxicity:</strong> Herbicides work because they're      dangerous; almost without exception, a human could be      killed by ingesting enough of a weed killer. Some      herbicides, however, would have to be taken in pretty heavy      doses to do the job. Paraquat is probably the most toxic      weed killer in widespread use today. In laboratory tests,      half of a population of rats will die if they're fed 150      milligrams of paraquat per kilogram of body weight. To put      that in human terms, it takes about a teaspoon of paraquat      to kill a person. People who handle herbicides - in      both production and application - can be in great      jeopardy if they don't exercise proper precautions.<br />      <br />      How likely is it that we'll be poisoned by herbicide      residues in our food? Not very likely. First of all, our      nasty example chemical, paraquat, is only applied to fields      at the rate of about a pound of active ingredient per acre,      which means that its concentration would be pretty low op      any given unit of food. And second, as you'll see in the      paragraph on persistence, the concentrations of many      herbicides drop off quickly. We do, however, consume some      amount of herbicides on treated crops or via livestock that      have eaten the crop or foraged on the ground. The long-term      effects of even small dosages are very difficult to      predict.<br />      <br />      There is no question that wildlife is damaged or killed by      certain herbicides. Birds can be injured if they get in the      way of spraying (small amounts of paraquat can kill eggs),      and the runoff from herbicide-treated fields can be      injurious to a range of water-dwelling organisms. The      herbicides paraquat, atrazine, and MSMA have been found to      inhibit the growth and productivity of algae in streams,      which can affect the overall bioproductivity of the water.      (Of course, no-till farming goes a long way toward      eliminating water runoff, so this new agricultural practice      may limit that specific effect.)<br />      <br />      <strong>Persistence:</strong> Herbicides remain active in      the soil for anywhere up to about 30 months, but most of      the commonly used chemicals have broken down by the end of      the eighth week after their application. DDT, an      insecticide, gained its notoriety because it remains active      in the environment for a very long time, accumulating in      the bodies of creatures (especially birds) exposed to it.      Herbicides, as opposed to insecticides, are less likely to      show such effects because they tend to break down as they      work. For example, 2,4-D is degraded as it does its job of      stimulating auxins in the plant. Paraquat may be the      herbicide that presents the greatest persistence problem.      Though it's held inactive in most soils, clay-heavy earth      may enhance its cumulative qualities, eventually posing a      hazard after a field has been sprayed for several      years.<br />      <br />      <strong>Ecological effects:</strong> There is widespread      concern that herbicides may kill soil microorganisms, those      bacteria and fungi that decompose organic matter and make      the earth fertile. In fact, many herbicides may inhibit      microorganism growth, and a few are very destructive.      Others, such as 2,4-D, seem to have no effect at all.<br />      <br />      There's also reason to worry about the development of      strains of weeds that aren't affected by herbicides. This      isn't a matter of the genetic development of strains      resistant to herbicides, the way in which some insects have      come to tolerate insecticides. Rather, weeds that are      <em>already</em> resistant - Johnsongrass is a good      example - often flourish in herbicide-treated fields.      Because other weeds that may have competed with the      resistant species have been wiped out, the tough weeds are      free to run amok.<br />      <br />      Problems such as the proliferation of resistant weeds      emphasize one of the major criticisms that proponents of      organic agriculture level against no-till/chemical farming.      By attempting to dominate the soil (an essentially      hubristic approach), farmers may leave themselves open to      disastrous failures. Learning to work with and improve the      soil is certain to be a far safer and more productive      approach in the long run.<br />      <br />      Are there means on the horizon for eliminating the      <em>need</em> for synthetic organic herbicides? Certainly.      The move away from monocropping is already reducing weed      problems, and many of the facets of good husbandry (such as      meticulous screening of seed for cleanliness) help. Then      too, there are developments in natural weed control.      Scientists at the University of North Carolina are using      plants against plants. By incorporating      <em>allelopathic</em> species (which release chemicals to      fight off neighbors) as cover crops in conjunction with      no-till plantings, they're having great success at      controlling weeds. So, aspects of no-till may offer      advantages over conventional tillage when coupled with      natural controls.<br />      <br />      In the near future, however, the necessity of having a      successful crop <em>every</em> year just to keep the bank      at bay is probably going to keep most no-till practitioners      from trying any risky experiments. And in the meantime,      no-till agriculture offers far more protection of our      precious topsoil than the plow does. How soon the      conversion to natural practices can be made is a difficult      question. Chemical companies have a tremendous vested      interest in seeing today's approach remain in place, and      powerful vested interests seem to determine our nation's      agricultural policies. If the conversion is to be made, it      will probably have to develop from the soil upward.    </p>
