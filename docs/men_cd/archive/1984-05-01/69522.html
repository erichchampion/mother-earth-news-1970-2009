        <h3>Without chemicals, life itself would he . . . at the least, somewhat less convenient.</h3><p>Each day the average American uses (directly and indirectly) hundreds of laborsaving formulations, and even the conscientious consumer is likely to be coerced into pushing the buttons on a few spray cans. In the last 50 years, chemicals (that is, those of the synthetic variety) have become an integral part of the U.S. way of life-not to mention of our economy.<br /><br />It would be easy to rail against the trend. After all, a hundred years ago people got along pretty well without an arsenal of aerosols. What's more, the harmful effects of chemical production and the disposal of its by-products may be the most serious environmental problems facing the country today. Indeed, there are frighteningly dangerous compounds that continue to be manufactured and used, despite widespread scientific knowledge of (and complaints about) their harmful effects. Only public outcry will bring grease to the wheels of regulation in a government bogged down in bureaucracy and badgered by commercial interests.<br /><br />However, it's consumer self-defense (not action) that's the subject of MOTHER's May/June mini-section. As you'll learn in the following pages, federal regulation is no assurance of safety from a whole array of compounds many of us use in our own homes. We'll be discussing substances that are much more insidious than newsworthy contaminants such as dioxins or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), even though they are much less dangerous on a per-unit basis. Most consumers are practically unaware of them, because the compounds may go unmentioned on labels or because their names are indecipherable. Some of the chemicals are additives that are known to be hazardous. Others are dyes or flavorings that have never been adequately tested. But the most sinister aspect of the proliferation of chemicals in the household is that most of us expose ourselves to these laborsaving elixirs for hours on end in our own homes every day. In effect, we live in chemical warehouses.<br /><br /><strong>WHAT IS A CHEMICAL?</strong><br /><br />Over the last few years, a major chemical company has used advertisements in its attempt to make the point that since all matter is made up of <em>chemicals</em>, that term certainly isn't a dirty word. Whatever you may think of the firm's motivations, the ads do make a worthwhile point: Simply because a compound sounds complex, that doesn't mean it's dangerous. Unless you have a strong background in chemistry, you probably won't be able to tell a harmful substance from a beneficial one purely on the basis of its name. For example, vitamin B 6 (an essential nutrient) goes by the technical names of <em>pyridoxine</em> or <em>pyridoxine hydrochloride</em>, either of which is a fair mouthful to pronounce.<br /><br />Likewise, simply being of natural (rather than synthetic) origin is no guarantee of a substance's safety. The ranks of suspected and known toxic and cancer-causing compounds are filled with plants and minerals. Generalizations really don't go very far when we're discussing hazardous substances. To make sensible decisions about the chemicals you live with, you'll need to be well armed with information.<br /><br /><strong>WHAT IS HAZARDOUS?</strong><br /><br />There are a number of different and fairly obvious ways in which chemicals can harm us, but judging the <em>degree</em> of risk is a very difficult matter. Toxic compounds cause one or more of a variety of bodily malfunctions. Perhaps they depress the central nervous system, making us drowsy or even causing death. Or maybe they attack the liver, where they accumulate when they're cleaned from our blood. The question is, <em>how much</em> of a particular substance does it take to cause such harm? If an inordinately high dosage must be taken to harm a human, the substance may be considered toxic but not hazardous.<br /><br />Only if that toxicity level is within the range of normal human in take (and a large margin of safety is used in the calculation) is it considered hazardous. The issue of toxicity is further complicated by the fact that bodily harm can be produced in a couple of different ways. A toxicant is said to be <em>acutely</em> toxic if it triggers a reaction soon after a single ingestion; a <em>chronic</em> poisoning may not produce symptoms until the compound has accumulated to a threshold level in the body-days, months, or years later.<br /><br />Scientists have developed a system for denoting the comparative toxicity of substances. Known as "lethal dose, 50%" (LD 50 ), it indicates the amount of a compound that must be administered to cause <em>half</em> of the test sample to die. For obvious reasons, LD 50 tests aren't run on humans; mice or rats are the most common "guinea pigs". The results can't be directly compared to human exposure, though, because animals don't necessarily react to toxicants in the same ways that people do.<br /><br />The tested chemicals are also administered in different fashions-orally, by under-skin injection, directly into the stomach, etc.-which can influence the outcome of an experiment. A substance may not be readily absorbed through the skin, while inhalation may allow it to pass through lung tissue quite easily.<br /><br />Furthermore, LD 50 isn't necessarily a good measure of chronic toxicity. Though a large quantity of a compound may be required to produce immediate death, much smaller amounts may add up-over continous exposure-to life-threatening levels.(Lead poisoning is a good example of this phenomenon.) Extended, expensive studies are required to determine chronic effects.<br /><br />There are further complications in the matter of determining the safety of a substance. For example, though allergy studies are seldom done prior to the introduction of a chemical to the market, many substances can have life-threatening effects on people with asthma. Also, in a process called <em>synergism</em> some comparatively innocuous chemicals may combine with others to increase the risk of each or to form a different (and more hazardous) substance. To date, the general population-that's <em>us</em> -is essentially the test sample for problems of this sort.<br /><br />Furthermore, though the measure of a chemical's toxic or allergenic effect on humans is inexact, those techniques are models of precision compared with the process of calculating a compound's cancer-causing potential. First of all, there is the unanswered ques tion of how cell mutation relates to cancer. If a compound produces genetic mutation in laboratory experiments, it's said to be <em>mutagenic</em>. If it produces cancer in humans or animals, it's said to be <em>carcinogenic</em>. Most, but not all, mutagens turn out to be carcinogens; so far, all carcinogens have proven to be mutagenic. Yet another type of mutating (but not necessarily cancer-causing) compound is a <em>teratogen</em>, which causes malformation in the fetus.<br /><br />Substances are tested for carcinogenicity by administering large dosages (usually hundreds or even thousands of times the amount found in normal human exposure) to laboratory animals over a period of a few weeks to a few years. It is assumed that the production of cancerous cells (if there is any) can be speeded up by increasing the dosage to very high levels. Industry isn't patient enough to wait 20 or 30 years to look for evidence of increased cancer from the use of a substance that they propose to put on the market. In addition, the life spans of most test animals are comparatively short. If no cancer is evident, then the substance is considered to be safe. But if some tumors show up, then the risk to humans is calculated by the dosage level and the incidence. The resulting figure estimates the number of cancer deaths per unit (usually thousands or millions) of population.<br /><br />The Reagan Administration has attempted to change Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency policy from a no-risk cancer stand to a cost-benefit one. Though the officials have been unsuccessful in developing a way of assigning dollar values to cancer deaths, regulations have been altered to allow a higher incidence of cancer from the use of some substances. The methods, regulations, and economics of determining the hazards of chemicals are nothing less than a morass; from our point of view they can probably be summed up thus: Will possibly hazardous compounds be considered innocent until proven guilty?<br /><br /><em>Substances that are labeled with a C are those</em><em>that cause cancer in animals or humans. Those that cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals are denoted by an A. Compounds that cause birth defects, spontaneous abortions, or other damage to animal or human fetuses have a T (for teratogen) next to them. All toxicants, hazardous either in small or large dosages, are marked with a skull and crossbones. You may also encounter two other symbols next to some compounds: An asterisk (*) indicates that dosages far higher than encountered in normal exposure are required to produce an adverse effect; suspected (but not confirmed) carcinogens and teratogens are labeled C? or T?; other questionable substances are marked with ? only.</em><br /><br /><strong>HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE</strong><br /><br />We've divided the subject matter of the Guide to Hazardous Household Substances into four sections, according to the locations in which you're likely to encounter different categories of harmful chemicals. You'll note as you read through the information that many of the substances are used in all sorts of consumer products. Formaldehyde, for example, is ubiquitous in the household. Therefore, for the sake of space, we'll often direct you to a previous discussion of a commonly occurring substance's effects.<br /><br />Each room of our model household includes an introduction to the regulations that help protect us from the dangerous substances that might be found there. This is necessary because different wings of our government deal with food, cleansers, building materials, etc. In some cases, we'll find that there is, in effect, no regulation at all! For those of you who will use the compounds that make up the body of each section, the labeling requirements that the agencies impose on different types of products will be extremely important. Without labels, you can do little more than <em>suspect</em> what may be included in a product.<br /><br />Of course, this manual can only highlight those toxicants and carcinogens that have been judged by experts to pose the most direct danger to you. There are a number of important areas that we've been forced to pass over, because not even these pages are enough to address all the hazards around the house. In general, we've tried to hit areas where consumers are least protected and most likely to be unaware of the existing hazards. Hence, we've not covered the synergistic reactions that can occur between common ingredients and prescription drugs. (Your physician should inform you of the interactions that are possible whenever he or she writes a prescription. In addition, an excellent reference to drug interactions can be found in Joe Graedon's <em>People's Pharmacy-Two</em> [Avon Books, 1980, $5.95].) Nor have we covered potentially dangerous household appliances, from microwave ovens to lawn mowers. All of the items listed in the following pages are <em>substances</em> that can cause you harm.<br /><br />The lists have been compiled by sifting through mounds of books and reports to pinpoint those chemicals (of the thousands introduced annually) that are both dangerous and commonly used. Throughout the mini-manual we've tried to list sources of more information. You should know, though, that since the 1980 election it seems to have become increasingly difficult to gain access to such information. References in popular and technical literature have dropped to a mere trickle. To that extent, preparing this section has been very frustrating: All too often there are no concrete answers to the question of whether a substance is hazardous or not. Wherever there is doubt, we hope we've erred on the side of safety!<br /><br />If you were to sit down and read this manual from beginning to end, you might come away with the impression that the situation is hopeless . . . that there's just no way to avoid hazardous substances. And it's true that most of us are going to be unable (or unwilling) to stay away from everything dangerous all the time. The point of this manual, though, is <em>not</em> to suggest that you should never again touch any of the things mentioned herein. Rather, we hope that you'll use the information to help recognize substances that may pose a hazard (even if it's small) and to limit your exposure to whatever degree is possible and practical. With knowledge, you can do your best for yourself and yours.<br /><br /><em><strong>Someone's in the Kitchen</strong></em><em><strong>With Dioctyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate</strong></em></p><p><strong>Food</strong><br /><br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) looks after the safety of our food and pharmaceuticals. Its legal basis is the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938-backed up by subsequent additions, including the Pesticide Chemicals Act of 1954, the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, and the Color Additives Amendment of 1960. For good reason, food is the most regulated of all consumer products, but the extent of protection may not be as great as you think.<br /><br />Before an additive may be used in food, it must be demonstrated to be safe. The testing, however, is conducted by the industry that proposes to <em>sell</em> it, not by the FDA. Furthermore, there's a loophole in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act's mandate for safety: Dangerous substances are prohibited from being added to food . . . except where they are "unavoidable" or "necessary in production" and are used in small enough doses that no apparent hazard is presented to test animals. As you can see, the mandate for safety is hazy.<br /><br />With the later amendments to the 1938 legislation, an important section called the Delaney Clause was added. This regulation prohibits the use of <em>any</em> additive that has been found to induce cancer in animals or humans. The Delaney Clause was fought by the FDA, the American Medical Association (AMA), and the food industry. Their argument, of course, was that the stipulation of "no risk" is excessively restrictive: In their view, the benefits of some additives outweigh the hazards. Twenty-five years after its inception, the Delaney Clause is still under attack. Separate amendments proposed to Congress in October of 1983-by Orrin Hatch of Utah in the Senate and Edgar Madigan of Illinois in the House-have, with the help of heavy lobbying from the plastics, meat, and soft drink industries, attempted to strike down or replace the Delaney Clause. (If you plan to write to your representative to express your opinion about such changes to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the pieces of legislation referred to are Senate bill S. 1938 and House bill H.R. 4121.)<br /><br />Under the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, additives that were used previous to that time and that showed no evidence of harm were permanently listed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). Only substances added to the list after the year of the amendment's enactment were to be tested. During his administration, President Nixon ordered the FDA to conduct research on all food additives. This work has been going on since 1970 and is not yet completed, but periodic updates are made to the GRAS list. Items are classified as [I] demonstrated to be safe, [II] safe at present consumption levels, [III] the question of safety requires further study, [IV] evidence of hazard, and [V] not enough data. Nearly all of the additives that are listed below fall into categories III, IV, or V.<br /><br />Food products have the most adequate labeling requirements of all the consumer goods that we're examining in this mini-manual. Each constituent used to formulate the product must be listed on the label in descending order of its percentage of the whole.<br /><br />There are, however, a number of exemptions that "streamline" labeling. For one, "incidental" compounds used to process a food, such as flour bleaches, need not be listed . . . because they aren't pres ent in the final product at more than trace levels. This disregards the fact that the processing chemicals may alter the nutritional value of food significantly.<br /><br />There are also a number of "standardized" products that don't require labeling as long as their makeups are within the guidelines of the 20 or so additives allowed by the FDA. Dairy products provide examples of standardized nonlabeling. Manufacturers are also allowed to use general descriptions, such as "preservative", "antioxidant", "sweetener", "artificial flavor", and so on. Without the specific name, we have no way of knowing whether or not the compound used is one about which we should be concerned.<br /><br />For further information on food additives, consult <em>A Consumer's Dictionary of Food Additives</em> by Ruth Winter (Crown Publishers, Inc., 1978, $4.95) or <em>The Food Additives Book</em> by Nicholas Freydberg and Willis A.

Cadmium causes abdominal pain, vomiting, anemia, kidney dysfunction, diarrhea, and pneumonia (if inhaled).<br /><br /><strong>Enamel coatings:</strong> The best coatings are made with tin oxide; less expensive products are made with antimony oxide.<br /><br />-Hazards: Antimony oxide glazes can chip off and form tartar emetic, which is mildly toxic.<br /><br /><strong>Iron:</strong> Contributes essential iron to the diet of most people.<br /><br />-Hazards: People with hemochromatosis (the inability to process iron) should avoid its use.</p><p><strong>Teflon-type coatings:</strong> May be any of a number of plastics besides the Du Pont product.<br /><br />-Hazards: Tetrafluoroethylene is toxic but is only released from cookware at very high temperatures (above 700°F). The coatings may chip off as the pot or pan wears.<br /><br /><strong>Stainless steel:</strong> Usually layered onto aluminum or steel.<br /><br />- Hazards: Persons with extreme metal sensitivity may need to avoid its use because of nickel leaching. In large dosages, nickel causes cancer.<br /><br /><strong>Dinnerware</strong><br /><br /><strong>Cadmium coatings:</strong> Used on some metal trays, particularly older ice cube trays.<br /><br />-Hazards: Acid-containing foods may leach cadmium from coated trays. Cadmium is highly toxic; see KITCHEN: Kitchenware, Earthenware. Decorated glasses: Many patterned glasses are prepared with decals.<br /><br />-Hazards: Decals contain strong concentrations of lead and cadmium, which may be released onto the hands or lips. Both are highly toxic; see KITCHEN: Kitchenware, Earthenware.<br /><br /><strong>Pewter:</strong> Old pewter may have been made with lead, a practice that's been discontinued.<br /><br />-Hazards: Lead is very toxic; see KITCHEN: Kitchenware, Earthenware. Plastic plates: Older plastic plates were often made with melamine and formaldehyde.<br /><br />-Hazards: Formaldehyde can leach from such products. It is toxic and carcinogenic; see UTILITY ROOM: Disinfectants/Air Fresheners.<br /><br /><strong>What Lurks in Your Utility Room?</strong><br /><br />Under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is required to regulate substances or products that are toxic, are flammable, are corrosive, are irritating, generate pressure, are radioactive, or cause strong reactions in people prone to allergies. It also regulates toys that present electrical, mechanical, or thermal hazards to children. The CPSC's mandate also includes the authority to require labeling on products that contain such hazardous substances or which present hazards by their design.<br /><br />To date, the CPSC's main concern has been with acute toxicity or other immediate hazards, so the study of chronic hazards of vapors in the household has been largely left to the Environmental Protection Agency. In the late 70's and early 80's the EPA began to study a number of different indoor pollution problems, the most prominent of them being emissions from gas appliances and heaters, kerosene heaters, and woodburning stoves. In the last two years, however, the EPA has largely abandoned work in these areas.<br /><br />To make matters worse, a bill (H.R. 2668) was introduced and passed in the House in the fall of 1983 that would strip the CPSC's ability to act. The bill proposes that no CPSC rule be enforceable until it has passed the House and Senate and has been signed by the President. The Senate's reaction to this legislation bears watching.<br /><br />It's not surprising, then, that the ability of regulation to protect us from the more insidious hazards of household products is quite limited. Once we tread beyond the immediate danger posed by the following substances, we've moved onto soft ground. It's our position, once again, that in the absence of knowledge, we should exercise caution.<br /><br />If you'd like more information on the safety of the cleansers, detergents, and other chemicals used to care for your home, we'd suggest that you look into <em>The Household Pollutants Guide</em> by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (Environmental Action Foundation, 1346 Connecticut Ave. N.W., Washington, DC 20036, $4.95) and <em>The Product Safety Book</em> by Stephen Brobeck and Anne C. Averyt (The Consumer Federation of America, E.P. Dutton, Inc. , 1983, $9.95).

According to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, the FDA is responsible for insuring that cosmetics are safe. Unfortunately, the agency has little real authority over the cosmetic manufacturers. The FDA can't require them to register their products or even to inform the agency of their ingredients. If the FDA receives reports that a cosmetic is unsafe, it can't order the product removed from the market pending a review To have any cosmetic taken off the market, the FDA must obtain a court order through a long and difficult procedure.<br /><br />The burden of proof is on the regulator. Cosmetics are definitely innocent until proven guilty. But with a nonadministrative staff of only 28 people (20 testers at FDA headquarters in Washington and eight field investigators) and a budget that in 1982 was only $2.3 million for the Cosmetic Technology Division, the agency is unable to pursue many cases. And even if the FDA had sufficient funds, it couldn't ban hair dyes that are known to contain carcinogens. Congress specifically exempted coal-tar dyes from the section of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that empowers the FDA to prohibit the use of "adulterated" substances.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, self-regulation doesn't seem to be working all that well, either. In 1978 the <em>Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary</em>, published by the Cosmetic Toiletry Fragrance Association, neglected to mention that 100 chemicals listed as cosmetic ingredients were also classed as suspected carcinogens by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The <em>Dictionary</em> also listed 24 other ingredients that NIOSH suspected of causing birth defects and 20 suspected of causing adverse nervous system effects-such as headaches, drowsiness, and convulsions-without making any mention of their possible hazards.<br /><br />To its credit, the FDA has established rules for cosmetic labeling, with which the majority of manufacturers have complied. But the agency has, at times, been less than enthusiastic about initiating the regulatory actions that lie within its powers. In 1978 Gregory Ahart of the General Accounting Office, appearing before a Congressional subcommittee, told its members, "The Consumer Product Safety Commission has established regulations requiring that specific warning statements be placed on the labels of household products containing certain toxic ingredients, but the FDA has not established similar regulations governing the use of the same ingredients in cosmetics."<br /><br />If you'd like to find out more about the compounds found in cosmetics, see <em>A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients</em> by Ruth Winter (Crown Publishers, Inc., 1976, $4.95).<br /><br /><strong>Acetone:</strong> Used in nail polishes and polish removers.<br /><br />-Hazards: Inhalation may cause headache, fatigue, excitement, bronchial irritation, and (in large amounts) narcosis.<br /><br /><strong>Aluminum chlorohydrate:</strong> Used in deodorants/antiperspirants.<br /><br />-Hazards: May be irritating to the skin.<br /><br /><strong>Artificial color:</strong> FD&C Blue No. 1 is used in facial cosmetics, creams, perfumes and cologne, soaps, and toothpaste.<br /><br />-Hazards: A suspected carcinogen.<br /><br /><strong>BHT:</strong> Used in lipsticks, eye makeup, creams, shaving creams, and skin care products.<br /><br />-Hazards: See KITCHEN: Food, Preservatives/Antioxidants.<br /><br /><strong>Boric acid:</strong> Used in baby powders, bath powders, creams, mouthwashes, soaps, and skin treatments.<br /><br />-Hazards: Extremely toxic and can be absorbed through abraded skin.

Banned from aerosol products. · Sodium zirconium lactate may cause chronically inflamed skin.<br /><br /><strong>Medications</strong><br /><br />As mentioned in the introduction to this mini-manual, we won't examine the hazards of prescription pharmaceuticals or their interactions with other substances. Rather, we'll review basic over-the-counter medicines that may contain substances that can be hazardous.<br /><br />The FDA is responsible for regulating all medicines and regularly receives recommendations from the American Medical Association. All ingredients in over-the-counter medications must be clearly labeled, and in most cases the quantities will be specified. An excellent layperson's reference to these medicines is <em>Widger's Guide to Over-the-Counter Drugs</em> by H. Neil Widger, M.D. (J.P. Tarcher, Inc., 1979, $10). For guidelines to the use of pharmaceuticals during pregnancy, see <em>The Handbook for Prescribing Medications During Pregnancy</em> by Richard L. Berkowitz, et al (Little, Brown and Co., 1981, $12.95).<br /><br /><strong>Acetaminophen:</strong> A pain reliever.<br /><br />- Hazards: Overdose causes liver damage.<br /><br /><strong>Aloe vera:</strong> Used as skin treatment for burns, rashes, and so on. Taken internally for upset stomach.<br /><br />-Hazards: Can cause diarrhea in nursing infants whose mothers ingest it.<br /><br /><strong>Antacids:</strong> Usually consist of aluminum or magnesium hydroxide, or sodium or calcium bicarbonate.<br /><br />-Hazards: Aluminum compounds cause constipation, while magnesium causes diarrhea. Aluminum has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease (senility). Sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for people on salt-restricted diets, because it increases blood pressure. Calcium bicarbonate can produce kidney stones and kidney damage; it also tends to increase acid production in the stomach.<br /><br /><strong>Antihistamines:</strong> The effective ingredients in allergy medications. Also found in cold remedies, menstrual-cramp medications, and sleeping pills, where they haven't been proven to be effective. -Hazards: Cause drowsiness, which is increased with consumption of alcohol. One antihistamine, aminoxide hydrobromide (related to scopola-mine), can incrcase severity of glaucoma, enlarge the prostate, and make urination difficult. Reduces lactation in nursing mothers.<br /><br /><strong>Artificial colors:</strong> FD&C Yellow No. 5 is used to coat, and color medications.<br /><br />-Hazards: Many medicines with Yellow No. 5 are allergy preparations. People prone to allergies are often affected by this dye See KITCHEN: Food, Flavorings/Colorings.<br /><br /><strong>Aspirin:</strong> An effective analgesic (pain reliever).<br /><br />-Hazards. Can cause upset stomach and bleeding (particularly if mixed with alcohol). Is associated with Reye's syndrome in children 5 to 16 who have a viral illness. The powdered forms often have a great deal of sodium, which increases blood pressure. Buffered varieties have antacids (see BATHROOM: Medications). Some contain caffeine (see KITCHEN: Food, Flavorings/Colorings). Some have phenacetin, which causes kidney disease and episodic anemia.<br /><br /><strong>Benzoyl Peroxide:</strong> The active ingredient in some acne medication.<br /><br />- Hazards: Has caused skin cancer in mice.<br /><br /><strong>Cough suppressants:</strong> Used for symptomatic relief from colds.<br /><br />-Hazards: Dextromethorphan causes drowsiness. Codeine (not in over-the-counter drug in many states) causes drowsiness and can be addictive if taken in large dosages over long periods.<br /><br /><strong>Decongestants:</strong> Used for symptomatic relief from colds and allergies. Better products contain pseudoephedrine, which is taken orally or by inhalation. Sometimes mixed with antihistamines, which aren't very effective in combating cold symptoms.<br /><br />-Hazards: Increase blood pressure. Cause nervousness, insomnia, palpitations, and a rise in blood sugar. Other ingredients, such as belladonna, may increase severity of glaucoma, enlarge the prostate, and produce a difficulty in urination. Phenylpropanolamine and phenylephrine greatly increase blood pressure.<br /><br /><strong>Diarrhea medications:</strong> The ones considered most effective contain opiates, which are not available over the counter in most states.<br /><br />-Hazards: Opiates cause drowsiness. They are addictive if consumed in large dosages over extended periods.<br /><br /><strong>Diet pills:</strong> None have been shown to be effective at producing weight loss.<br /><br />-Hazards: Some contain the decongestant phenylpropanolamine, which greatly increases blood pressure. Most contain caffeine (see KITCHEN: Food, Flavorings/Colorings).<br /><br /><strong>Ethyl alcohol:</strong> A common ingredient in cold remedies, cough suppressants, and mouthwashes.<br /><br />-Hazards: Addictive. Causes nausea, vomiting, impaired coordination, coma, and death. Chronic effects include liver damage. Fetal alcohol syndrome includes low birth weight, physical defects, and retardation. Alcohol crosses into the milk during lactation. Increases stomach upset and bleeding when combined with aspirin.<br /><br /><strong>Expectorants:</strong> Used to loosen phlegm to relieve bronchial congestion. There is some controversy over their effectiveness.<br /><br />-Hazards: Often mixed with decongestants, antihistamines, and/or aspirin (see BATHROOM: Medications).<br /><br /><strong>Hemorrhoidal preparations:</strong> Some contain antihistamines.<br /><br />-Hazards: See BATHROOM: Medications, Antihistamines.<br /><br /><strong>Laxatives:</strong> May consist of softeners, bulking agents, cathartics, and/or stimulants.<br /><br />-Hazards: Sodium cathartics cause loss of body fluids and kidney problems. Stimulants can cause stomach cramps and dependence. Castor oil causes loss of body fluids and reduction of sodium and potassium electrolytes. Mineral oil prevents absorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K and is a suspected carcinogen.<br /><br /><strong>Medications to avoid during pregnancy:</strong> Many compounds can cross the placenta into the growing fetus.<br /><br />-Hazards: Caffeine (see KITCHEN: Food, Flavorings/Colorings). Ethyl alcohol (see BATHROOM: Medications). Salicylate is an aspirin compound that can prolong pregnancy and increase postpartum bleeding. Large dosages of vitamin D can produce excess calcium in the infant. Large dosages of vitamin B 6 can produce dependency in the infant.<br /><br /><strong>Menstrual preparations:</strong> Usually consist of painkillers, diuretics, caffeine, antihistamines, and/or decongestants. The last four are probably ineffective.<br /><br />-Hazards: Acetaminophen (see BATHROOM: Medications). Antihistamines (see BATHROOM: Medications). Aspirin (see BATHROOM: Medications). Decongestants (see BATHROOM: Medications). Diuretics can cause excessive body-fluid loss.<br /><br /><strong>Motion-sickness drugs:</strong> The way these drugs work is not well understood. Dimenhydrinate is the most common ingredient.<br /><br />-Hazards: Causes drowsiness. Can increase severity of glaucoma, enlarge the prostate, and cause urine retention.<br /><br /><strong>Skin medications:</strong> Usually consist of ointments or sprays that are antiseptic and/or antibiotic.<br /><br />-Hazards: Boric acid (see BATHROOM: Cosmetics). Cresol (see UTILITY ROOM: Disinfectants/Air Fresheners). Neomycin can cause skin rashes; it sensitizes allergic people to a whole range of antibiotics.<br /><br /><strong>Sleeping pills:</strong> Many of these are simply antihistamines.<br /><br />-Hazards: Antihistamines (see BATHROOM: Medications). Most sleeping pills interrupt normal sleep cycles and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; the rest produced is not as effective as in normal sleep. Throat lozenges: Usually have an anesthetic and/or antiseptic.<br /><br />-Hazards: Some contain carbolic acid, or phenol (see UTILITY ROOM: Disinfectants/Air Fresheners).<br /><br /></p><p><strong>Is This Really the Living Room?</strong></p><p>Our section on the living room is really one that extends to all the materials from which your home and its furnishings are made. These substances will be of prime concern to people who are living in new, energy-efficient homes with low air-exchange rates. But even in the typically well-ventilated older home, the levels of some gases that may be inhaled can reach the point at which sensitive individuals are affected.<br /><br />The Federal Trade Commission shares responsibility with the CPSC for regulating building materials, though its authority is mostly in the regulation of combustibility and appropriate labeling. During the recent uproar concerning the toxic gas emitted by urea-formaldehyde insulation, it was the CPSC that banned the use of that product. Subsequently, a federal court overturned the ruling, and urea-formaldehyde is once again permitted for residential and commercial use.<br /><br />Few products that emit toxic compounds are labeled as such, so in the following notations we'll try our best to list all of the sources of the substances mentioned.<br /><br /><strong>Asbestos:</strong> Asbestos was outlawed as a building material in the 1970's, and hair dryers with asbestos thermal insulation were recalled by the CPSC. Nevertheless, there may be existing sources of asbestos in your home.<br /><br />-Hazards: Causes asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma (a rare type of lung cancer) if inhaled. Ingestion can produce a variety of other cancers. Asbestos crosses the placenta into the fetus, affecting the unborn. It acts synergistically with other toxic substances. It remains suspended in the air for long periods. If asbestos products are damaged, have qualified, properly equipped personnel remove them from your home.<br /><br />-Found in: Thermal and electrical insulation; fireproofing materials, such as woodstove insulation boards and ironing board covers; plaster, drywall and drywall compound, ceiling tiles, and cement; exterior shingles; and roofing.<br /><br /><strong>Formaldehyde:</strong> One of the most ubiquitous hazardous substances in the household.<br /><br />-Hazards: See UTILITY ROOM: Disinfectants/Air Fresheners.<br /><br />-Found in: Urea-formaldehyde insulation; interior plywood, particleboard, and paneling; paper-bag binders; synthetic countertop materials; wallpaper glue; resins and oil-based paints; cosmetics; air fresheners; wood glue; plaster of paris; plastics; cigarette smoke; facial tissues and paper napkins; and synthetic fibers, including clothing, upholstery, drapes, and carpeting.<br /><br /><strong>Radon gas and its progeny:</strong> Radon is itself a daughter product of radium compounds present in the soil, groundwater, natural gas, and building materials, and it further decays into other radioactive gases.<br /><br />-Hazards: Causes lung cancer in humans. Acts synergistically with smoke. Worst-case indoor concentrations have been one-half to one-third of those found in uranium mines. Cancer risk is still significant. For information on a reasonably priced test, write to the National Indoor Environmental Institute, 5200 Butler Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462.<br /><br />-Found in: Soil beneath houses; water; natural gas burned in appliances; and building materials, including concrete, rock, tile, brick, and other mineral-based materials.<br /><br /><strong>Vinyl chloride:</strong> A by-product and leachate of polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastic. The use of vinyl chloride itself was regulated in 1976.<br /><br />-Hazards: Irritates mucous membranes. Causes liver dysfunction. Related to hepatitis, chronic bronchitis, Raynaud's syndrome, and loss of vision. Has caused cancer in test animals.<br /><br />-Found in: Upholstery (particularly automotive), plastic, floor tiles, and plumbing.</p>
