                  <p>        <strong>Opinions & Expertise</strong>      </p>              <h3>      Part III    </h3>    <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor</em> <em>of Population      Studies and Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford      University) and Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate,      Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar      names to ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But      while most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing      in the areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us      - for instance - have read Paul's book      <strong>The Population Bomb</strong> ), few people have any      idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological      research (the type that tends to be published only in      technical journals and college texts). That's why we're      pleased to present this regular semitechnical column by      these wellknown authors/ecologists/educators.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Anne and Paul Ehrlich    </h5>    <p>      In this column we'll conclude the discussion -      carried in the last two issues of MOTHER - of ways in      which a more sane world might be created.<br />      <br />      <em>Population control is not impossible.</em> There are      enough success stories around the world to indicate that      population growth <em>can</em> be brought to a halt . . .      <em>if</em> political will can be mustered. The same      approach won't work everywhere, of course, but levels of      success achieved in places as disparate as the People's      Republic of China, Singapore, Costa Rica, and Kerala State      in India do indicate some common threads leading toward      reductions in birth rate. Important among these are at      least <em>some</em> progress toward social justice . . .      education (especially of girls) . . . improved nutrition .      . . adequate housing, sanitation, and health care . . . and      access to birth control information and materials. While      not all societies in which birth rates have been declining      have been able to meet every one of these needs, it's      become clear that the keys to reducing runaway population      growth are social justice, decent living conditions, and      realistic hope for a better quality of life.<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, although the population problem is now      widely recognized, governments (with the prominent      exception of China) still tend to talk in terms of merely      reducing growth rates . . . rather than halting population      growth and then instituting a slow decline. Part of the      blame for this must rest upon rich countries, especially      the United States, which has not officially recognized the      national and global impacts of its own gross overpopulation      and has yet to formulate any policy that would lead to      eventual population reduction. The point must be driven      home that - because of the enormous pressures that      wealthy nations put on global resources and the environment      - population growth in prosperous countries has, in      many ways, much more dire consequences for the world than      has such expansion in poor nations. There has been a      revolution in thinking concerning population control in the      last decade. That revision in attitude now has to be      carried even further and must be translated into much more      effective <em>action</em> .<br />      <br />      <em>The entire world cannot be industrialized</em> .      Obviously, a sane world would maintain a balance between      agricultural and industrial areas <em>and</em> would be      greatly concerned with protecting the environment. It      immediately follows that the notion, held by some      economists, that problems of equity (and of controlling      population) can be solved by fully industrializing all      nations is simply preposterous. Earth's industrial capacity      is <em>already</em> able to provide enough material goods      to support today's degree of overpopulation at a reasonable      level of material affluence.<br />      <br />      With more efficient use of resources and less built-in      obsolescence, every family could probably have a bicycle, a      small refrigerator, electricity, cooking facilities, and      indoor plumbing. The goal of so supplying the world could      take up the slack created by phasing out of production      F-15's, Backfire bombers, missiles, tanks, aircraft      carriers, and so on. The problems of setting and reaching      sensible development goals for the poor countries      (something that we and John Holdren have called      "grass-roots development") are complicated . . . but are      not insurmountable.<br />      <br />      <br />      Similarly, the "de-development" of the overdeveloped      countries would, in theory, be easy and beneficial for all,      but again the question of political and social will rears      its ugly head. The time to rethink the situation in these      nations is <em>now</em> , however. They are pulling out of      a severe recession, and unemployment is centered in      precisely those sectors of the material economy that are      most environmentally destructive. A full-scale dialogue      regarding the meaning of "productivity", might lead to a      longneeded revision of industrial economies.<br />      <br />      <em>The political power of the people can be      mobilized.</em> The power of public opinion is evident in      much of the world: It helped get the United States out of      Vietnam . . . it's pushing the superpowers toward a nuclear      freeze . . . it forced the Israeli government to      investigate the Beirut massacres . . . it's kept the      Russians out of Poland . . . and it helped end the      so-called Cultural Revolution in China. (On the darker      side, it also mobilized the British people to do combat      over the Falkland Islands.) Even in the worst      dictatorships, the desires of the public <em>can</em>      affect governmental policies.<br />      <br />      It should, therefore, be possible to mobilize public      opinion on all of the issues crucial to a transition to a      saner world. Much has already been accomplished concerning      war and the environment, but much more is required.      Progress has been slower on such topics as greater economic      fairness in both national and international arenas, and      there has been virtually <em>no</em> movement toward the      development of sustainable economic systems. However, the      potential clearly exists for getting the public actively      involved in such issues.<br />      <br />      <em>Resources can be mobilized.</em> One of the main      reasons for pessimism about the fate of the Earth is the      immense quantity of physical, financial, and human      resources that must be mobilized simultaneously to attack      the many interrelated problems making up the human      predicament. It's useless, for example, to control      population growth if material "throughput" per person is      allowed to grow continually . . . or if the technological      means for supplying affluence have increasingly negative      impacts on the environment.<br />      <br />      Still, an ameliorating factor is that many of the necessary      resources can be summoned by reallocation. The most obvious      place to begin would be to shift them from military to      other uses.<br />      <br />      The plethora of resources potentially available in this      area can be seen in the roughly <em>seven hundred billion      dollars</em> spent annually worldwide to support armies,      navies, and air forces. In the crudest terms, that's enough      money to double the yearly income of the poorest half of      the Earth's population! It could actually double the rate      of capital <em>investment</em> in needy countries. Surely      that course of action would increase <em>everyone's</em>      security. The capital, manpower, and expertise now devoted      to the military enterprise could, in a decade or so, go a      long way toward providing clean water, sufficient food,      decent clothing, adequate housing, and basic education and      medical care to all who lack them.<br />      <br />      The benefits of this single reallocation would not,      however, be limited to directly improving the lot of the      poverty-stricken. It would also result in a shift away from      industries involved in the construction of military      hardware, with their consumption of mineral resources and      their creation of pollution, to more environmentally benign      sectors of the economy. Needless to say, it would also      produce incalculable benefits by reducing the threat of      war.<br />      <br />      Today, one of the most serious misallocations of resources      is from human needs to the military, but there are many      other problem areas. Consider the enormous emphasis on      energy- and material-intensive transportation (especially      in the rich parts of the world). Redesigned patterns of      habitation plus rearranged transportation priorities could      effect vast savings, freeing up talent and resources for      other tasks.<br />      <br />      <em>Human attitudes can change.</em> To move toward a sane      world, people will have to discard numerous deeply embedded      patterns of behavior and many firmly held beliefs, such as      the convictions that the primary allegiance of every      individual belongs to his or her nation state, that wars      are natural and inevitable, that progress will go on      forever (and consists primarily of acquiring more and more      gadgets), and so on. A world in which all - or at      least many - of these attitudes did not exist is      unthinkable to a majority of our population, even though      millions of human beings have lived rich and happy lives      without holding <em>any</em> of them.<br />      <br />      Even today, not all human societies are warlike . . . and      the concepts of the nation state, economic growth, and even      progress are quite recent inventions. Furthermore, there's      abundant evidence that attitudes can change very rapidly      when the time is right. A now classic example of this was      the change in viewpoint regarding family size that occurred      in the United States at the end of the 1960's and in the      early 1970's. What many sociologists had thought would be a      long and troubled transition to smaller family units took      place in a very few years . . . and with no difficulty at      all.<br />      <br />      It's already clear to most people that many of the old ways      simply won't serve any longer. Preparing for Armageddon,      turning the old economic crank ever faster, destroying the      environment, hating other people, and slaving to get more      and more of less and less are <em>not</em> producing      populations of healthy, happy people. And only the most      obtuse believe, for example, that the rich nations will be      able to remain forever afloat in our world's rising sea of      poverty and despair. The time has come for a fundamental      reexamination of the human condition, a worldwide effort to      find new goals and move toward them. A sane world can be      achieved. Whether or not it <em>will</em> be is another      question.    </p>    <p>      Some of these ideas were first presented at the first      biennial "Conference on the Fate of the Earth" in New York      in October 1982. The Ehrlichs' work is supported in part by      a grant from the Koret Foundation of San Francisco.    </p>
