                        <p>        <em>This issue's column was guest-written - for Dr.        Tom Ferguson - by contributors to <strong>Medical        Self-Care</strong> magazine.</em>      </p>			<h5 id="byline">by Mike Samuels, M.D., and Nancy Samuels</h5>        <p>      After the birth of a boy, one of the first and most      difficult decisions faced by the parents is often the      question of circumcision: the surgical removal of the      foreskin that covers the head of the penis. Although few      parents have given a lot of thought to the procedure in the      past (many expectant couples routinely sign a consent form      for the operation when they check into the hospital), the      subject is becoming increasingly controversial as new      findings contradict long-established medical beliefs.<br />      <br />      <strong>6,000-YEAR HISTORY</strong><br />      <br />      One of the most ancient of surgical procedures,      circumcision is pictured in Egyptian bas-reliefs dating      back to 4000 B.C. Tribal cultures around the world -      including the Australian aborigines and many African and      South Pacific people - circumcise their boys shortly      after birth, or as part of later initiation rites. And, of      course, Jews have a very long history of the practice . . .      in the Old Testament, God commands Jews to circumcise boys      eight days after birth as a sign of His covenant with      Abraham.<br />      <br />      In this country, however, circumcision has spread far      beyond those groups who connect it with religious or      cultural beliefs: It has become a common medical procedure.      Before the 1870's, very few non-Jewish American males were      circumcised . . . but by 1910, 56% were. And today, about      85% of the boys born in the United States are circumcised.      In fact, we're the <em>only</em> Western nation (besides      Israel) that still practices circumcision on a large scale.      (For example, in England the percentage used to be quite      high, but has now dropped to less than one percent.)<br />      <br />      <strong>MEDICAL FACTS AND FALLACIES</strong><br />      <br />      The foreskin, or prepuce, is a double layer of skin -      similar to a lined sleeve - that fits snugly over the      tip (glans) of the penis. The outer layer is continuous      with the outer layer of the penis, and protects the glans      (and the urinary opening in particular). The inner layer is      more like a mucous membrane . . . it secretes smegma, a      lubricating substance that allows the foreskin to slide      back and forth easily over the head of the penis. Since the      inner layer houses many nerve endings, it is highly      sensitive and enhances sexual pleasure.<br />      <br />      The foreskin starts developing during the third month of      gestation, and by the fifth month is fused to the tip of      the penis. By birth, it has usually begun to separate from      the glans . . . a process that continues during the first      years of life. By puberty, the foreskin should be fully      retractable.<br />      <br />      Doctors once thought that circumcision should be used to      "correct" a foreskin that could not be retracted at birth .      .. and some physicians believed that the foreskins of      uncircumcised boys had to be forced back to break what were      thought to be adhesions, which are membranes connecting      tissues that should be separate. But now, medical science      generally understands that both the fusion of the foreskin      to the glans and their eventual, gradual separation are      normal.<br />      <br />      Today, an infant's foreskin is considered too tight only if      it impedes the child's ability to urinate normally.<br />      <br />      Physicians also once believed that circumcision prevented      cancer of the penis and cervix. The theory was that these      diseases were caused by smegma, since epidemiological      studies showed lower rates of such cancers in circumcised      men and their spouses. Recently, however, these studies      have fallen into disrepute as being too simplistic . . .      with careful foreskin hygiene, uncircumcised men and their      lovers show no greater risk of disease than do other      couples. Circumcision was also thought to prevent      infections of the foreskin, but we know now that these      problems, too, can be avoided with basic personal care.      Young boys should simply be taught to cleanse the inner      layer regularly by retracting the foreskin as far as it      will go (without forcing it!) and washing with mild soap      and water.<br />      <br />      A study in Scandinavia, where circumcision is rare, showed      that only two-tenths of one percent of older boys and men      had to be circumcised for medical reasons. The current      position of the American Academy of Pediatrics Ad Hoc Task      Force on Circumcision is that there are "no valid medical      indications for circumcision in the neonatal period".<br />      <br />      <strong>THREE TECHNIQUES</strong><br />      <br />      Circumcision is one of only a few surgical procedures still      routinely performed without anesthesia. The infant is      simply restrained (either held or strapped to a table) . .      . the penis is washed with an antiseptic . . . and then a      surgical probe is used to separate the foreskin from the      glans. To remove the foreskin, one of three methods is      used. The least common involves cutting with surgical      scissors from bottom to top, and then around in a circle.      Another method uses a metal clamp. The foreskin is slit      vertically, and a metal cone is placed between it and the      tip. The prepuce is then stretched over the cone, a clamp      is attached to squeeze blood out of the area, and the      foreskin is removed with a scalpel. The third method is      similar to the second, but employs a plastic cone. After      the foreskin is stretched over the device, the base of the      prepuce is tied tightly with a string that acts like a      tourniquet. The end of the foreskin is then cut off, and      the rest withers and falls away within ten days.<br />      <br />      Until recently, doctors were unconcerned about the pain of      circumcision, apparently because of the traditional medical      belief that newborns are insensitive to pain. However, now      we know that babies are highly developed at birth. They can      see, hear, smell, feel, and learn remarkably well . . .      even during the first few days after birth. Newborns      certainly can experience pain, as their reaction during      circumcision demonstrates. All babies scream, tremble, and      cry . . . many hold their breath or vomit.<br />      <br />      Furthermore, infants often continue to be irritable for      days after being circumcised. Research has shown that blood      levels of adrenal hormones involved in stress reactions      rise after the procedure. Another study indicated that      circumcision decreased the rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep      involved in dreaming. A third report showed that recently      circumcised boys react to noise differently than do their      uncircumcised counterparts.<br />      <br />      Neonatal researcher Yvonne Brackbill writes: "From all      three studies, we may conclude that circumcision does      affect infant behavior and psychophysiology. In view of all      the evidence showing long-term behavioral, physiological,      anatomical, and even neuropharmacological effects of      'minor' events in early development, we would be unwise to      assume without empirical demonstration that the effects of      circumcision are short-lived."<br />      <br />      <strong>POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS</strong><br />      <br />      Like any surgical procedure, circumcision may cause      complications . . . a fact that, until recently, has not      received, proper attention. The most frquent problems are      excessive bleeding (requiring sutures or chemical      cauterization) . . . infection (requiring post-operative      care and possibly antibiotics) . . . urinary obstruction      due to contraction of the skin at the base of the foreskin      (requiring repeat surgery for correction) . . . and      surgically caused problems resulting from improper      technique.<br />      <br />      The complication rate among circumcisions is <em>not</em>      high, and the problems that do occur are rarely      life-threatening or permanent. However, the rate      <em>is</em> much higher than the rates of the infections      and cancers that circumcision was once thought to prevent.      An article in <em>Pediatrics</em> states, "Before      undertaking circumcision, the physician should be aware      that significant complications may occur in one newborn in      500."<br />      <br />      <strong>A PERSONAL DECISION</strong><br />      <br />      Today, with the medical justifications for circumcision      largely abandoned, the question has become primarily one of      religious or cultural tradition. To many people, these      beliefs are very important and should be carefully weighed.      In any event, however, expectant parents should at least      consider the issue - and make a conscious decision      about it, one way or the other - <em>before</em> the      baby arrives.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Mike and Nancy Samuels are the      authors</em> <em>of</em> The Well Baby Book <em>(Summit      Books, 1979, $11.50), an excellent guide that's available      in most libraries and bookstores.</em>    </p>    <p>      Medical Self-Care , Dr. Tom Ferguson's quarterly journal,      is available for $15 per year from Medical Self-Care, P.O.
