                <p>      <em>On MOTHER's recent visit to Tanzania and Rwanda, we      discovered, surprisingly enough, that tourists may offer      the best(and probably<br /> the last) hope of saving. . .</em>    </p>        		<p>				More than 120,000 people      are living off a two-kilometer strip of land bordering      Rwanda's Virunga Volcanoes National Park, the home of the      rare and mighty mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla      beringei). In fact, almost every available spot of earth in      this tiny, central African country has been divided into      small plots of corn, peas, pineapples, bananas, and      sorghum. Such plantings are staggered up to the very tops      of the steep mountain slopes, and the intense cultivation      makes one wonder where this nation, the most densely      populated on the African continent, will ever find room to      put the doubled population it expects within the next two      decades!<br />      <br />      <strong>AN ECOLOGICAL LESSON</strong><br />      <br />      Only a few years ago, 22,000 acres-or nearly half-of the      thickly forested Volcanoes National Park, the first such      reserve ever established in Africa, were given over to the      cultivation of pyrethrum. (This white daisylike      chrysanthemum is the source of a natural insecticide and      provides Rwanda with one of its few cash crops.) Shortly      thereafter, residents found that, as a result of the      destruction of so much of the precipitationproducing rain      forests, the surface streams in the area had dried up. For      the first time, then, the local population began to become      aware of the value of leaving this beautiful montane      rain-forest ecosystem undisturbed.<br />      <br />      Even so, the pressures being exerted upon the remaining      park area are immense. The wooden stakes marking its      boundaries are often surreptitiously moved back by local      residents hoping to gain even a few more feet of farmland      or a tree or two to cut for scarce cooking fuel. In spite      of this, the money necessary to install more permanent      cement boundary markers has been slow to materialize.    </p>            			<p>      Poachers, too, are always a menace to the park's wildlife,      which-in addition to its famous gorillas-includes nearly      100 forest elephants (rare, smaller relatives of the      savanna pachyderm), buffalo, black-fronted and yellowbacked      duikers, bushbuck (notable for their doglike bark), tree      hyraxes, giant forest hogs, giant rats, and approximately      100 species of birds. Three other species of primates      occupy the park-the blue monkey, the golden monkey, and      Bosman's potto.<br />      <br />      Gorilla poachers are often hired by unscrupulous zoos (both      public and private) wanting a gorilla baby, and usually a      whole family group is killed, as the adults will fight to      the death to protect their young. The fact that gorillas      give birth on average only every four to five years means      that even limited poaching can have a disastrous effect on      populations. While poaching for the gorillas themselves is      still a problem in Rwanda, an even greater concern arises      when local people, wishing to supplement their protein-poor      diet, attempt to snare some of the park's antelope.      Unfortunately, curious gorillas frequently lose a hand or      foot in the traps and often end up dying of gangrene as a      result. (One of the participants in MOTHER's tour to the      gorilla's homeland accidentally tripped just such a      snare.)<br />      <br />      An internationally sponsored project now pays for guards to      patrol the 30,000-acre refuge, and the ofcials do bring in      a number of poachers each week, dealing with them fairly      harshly. But there simply aren't enough guards, and there's      very little money to provide those already on duty with      such basic necessities as guns, ammunition, and uniforms.      In addition, the park shares its borders with Uganda and      Zaire, which have even poorer wildlife protection records      than Rwanda does. (Zaire is now laying the groundwork for      its own gorilla program, but it will need several years,      additional outside staff, and much money if the program is      to become effective.)<br />      <br />      <strong>AN ECONOMIC VALUE</strong><br />      <br />      In a country already teetering on a nutritional tightrope,      not even well-defined park boundaries, guards, and the      widespread understanding of the danger of crop losses due      to lack of water would be enough to save the park from the      effects of out-of-control population growth. What may      rescue 'the area from encroachment is the growing      recognition that its 140 rare gorillas (there are just over      240 in the entire Rwanda/Uganda/ Zaire region) have a real      economic value. The animals are Rwanda's greatest tourist      attraction, and thus are a source of muchneeded foreign      currency.<br />      <br />      Two of Rwanda's 15 gorilla groupsfamily units that      generally consist of one male "silverback" (so named      because of the saddle of silver hair across his back), two      to five females, and a number of offspring-have been      studied by scientific researchers for many years. After      finally recognizing the animals' tourist potential, the      park personnel set out to "desensitize" three other groups      (designated as #9, #11, and #13) by gradually exposing them      to human beings. The entire process took up to a year and a      half for each family.    </p>    			<p>      In time, however, the gentle giants became accustomed to      their daily visitors, first ignoring and then eventually      interacting with them. (Though all of the guides are      carefully trained in gorilla "good manners" and are able to      imitate the animal's gruntlike language, only one person      works with each family, whenever possible, because a group      is quick to recognize and react to a change of guides.) In      addition, no more than six people (paying a fee of $40      each) are allowed to visit a group on any given day, and      even then the contact is usually limited to an hour or      less.    </p>    			<p>      In spite of the fact that every effort has been made to      protect these three go rilla families from any excessive      disturbance of their natural behavior and movements, they      have, in a sense, been "sacrificed" for human enjoyment in      an effort to save the habitat of their fellow primates.      Since they no longer fear human intrusions, the      desensitized animals are now even more vulnerable to being      preyed upon by man, their only natural enemy.<br />      <br />      <strong>AN UNFORGETTABLEEXPERIENCE</strong><br />      <br />      After you arrive at the park headquarters in northwestern      Rwanda and obtain one of the few visitor's permits, getting      to the gorillas themselves involves a ride of several miles      on rough roads to a point near the forest that includes      part of a family's seven-toten-squarekilometer territory.      Then you may have to walk an hour or so across cultivated      fields before actually entering the dense canopy of bamboo      that covers the volcanoes' lower slopes. Once there, .it's      frequently necessary to crawl on hands and knees through      thick vines and nettles (gloves are essential); often the      way can be made passable only with the aid of the guide's      machete.<br />      <br />      After your escort picks up the gorillas' easily recognized      trail, you might have to follow it for several more      exhausting hours, up steep slopes, through mud, and over      vertical rock faces . . . perhaps to an elevation of over      10,000 feet. But it's possible to be more fortunate, as was      our associate editor on the expedition taken by MOTHER's      tour. Group #13 was found just ten minutes from the edge of      a farmer's field, enjoying its midday relaxation/siesta      period. (Gorillas are primarily vegetarian, though they      have been known to eat insects, and they spend early      mornings and late afternoons foraging for food.)    </p>            			<p>      But whether the journey is easy or incredibly difficult,      the sight of these wonderful creatures will make whatever      effort and expense it takes to, get to them well      worthwhile. A 400-pound silverback-with its large cranial      crest and intelligent, glaring eyesis nothing short of      awesome. What's more, if you obey the rules, you can      observe this powerful patriarch and his family from a      distance of just a few feet! Indeed, juvenilescovered with      soft, brown, puppylike furdelight in showing off their      wrestling skills, breaking off such matches occasion ally      to indulge in some adult-style chest thumping. They're      likely to tumble unconcernedly across your legs and may      even stop to examine your hair, ear, or camera. The guides      try to gently discourage this kind of interaction, since      they fear that close contact may result it he transmission      of human diseases. Nothing, in fact, will end a visit      faster than for a visitor to start coughing. (On one      occasion, however, an adult female gorilla surprised one of      our guides by greeting him with a resounding kiss!) Other      taboos are talking, smiling, staring, pointing, and-in the      case of a gorilla charge-running. The first four actions      will be interpreted by the animals as aggressiveness, and      the fifth, while being a natural human instinct in the face      of 400 pounds of screaming fury, is a terrible mistake      that's likely to result in some bad bites on the      backside!<br />      <br />      Normally, though, the gorillas-even females with very young      babies-seem remarkably at ease around camera-clicking      intruders. They play, doze, feed, and climb trees with only      passing glances and glares at their human companions, and      if a family member does become a bit agitated, a few grunts      from the guide seem to calm the animal immediately. Of      course, this nonchalant behavior should never lure a      visitor into thinking these are tame beings .. . though      that attitude is extremely unlikely, since the gorillas'      obvious strength is far too impressive to inspire anything      but the greatest respect. And inevitably, along with that      respect comes the deep desire to help these most      magnificent and gentle creatures to survive in peace.<br />      <br />      <strong>HELP FOR A VANISHING BREED</strong><br />      <br />      It is apparent to those of us who have had the rare      privilege of being tolerated by the gorillas in their      ever-shrinking forest home that they will not survive      without a great deal of financial help. We at THE MOTHER.      EARTH NEWS 9, along with Anne and Paul Ehrlich, our tour      leaders on this African trip (who will be writing more      about the gorillas in future Ecoscience columns), urge you      to send contributions to African Wildlife Leadership      Foundation, Dept. TMEN, 1717 Massachusetts Ave. N.W.,      Washington, D.C. 20036, and ask that the funds be directed      to the support of The Mountain Gorilla Project in Rwanda.      Currently, the budget for this undertaking is only $50,000      a year, and even this relatively small sum has been      difficult to raise. Therefore, any donation you would be      able send will be very meaningful.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For more information on the mountain      gorillas, read</em> <em>Gorillas in the Mist by Dian Fossey      (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1983, $19.95), available at your      bookstore or public library.</em>    </p>
