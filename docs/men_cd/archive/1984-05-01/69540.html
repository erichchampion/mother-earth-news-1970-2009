                        <p>      Lately, more and more people have begun to understand just      how limited-in both variety and nutrional      value-our "modern" diets have become. This      realization has Sparked a new and wide-spread      interest in the culinary and therapeutic uses of herbs . .      . those plants which-although not well-known      today-were, just one short generation ago, honored      "guests" on the dinner tables and in the medicine chests of      our grandparents' homes. In this regular feature MOTHER      will examine the availability, cultivation, and benefits of      our "forgotten" vegetable foods and remedies . . .      and-we hope-help prevent the loss of still      another bit of ancestral lore.<br />      <br />      If you enjoy fragrance, you'll probably like sweet woodruff      ( <em>Asperula odorata</em> or <em>Galium odoratum</em> ),      because its scent has been likened to that of new-mown hay      or vanilla. A perennial that thrives in moist woods in      temperate climes, sweet woodruff has, for      <em>centuries</em> , been gathered and dried for use asa      <em>-</em> mong other things <em>-</em> a      strewing herb (the old-fashioned equivalent of today's air      fresheners), a perfume and potpourri ingredient, a tonic      tea, and a special addition to the May Day wine ("Maibowl")      with which Europeans celebrate the return of spring.      Furthermore, on St. Barnabas's and St. Peter's days,      bouquets of woodruff, sweet box, lavender, and roses were      placed in churches.    </p>    		     <p>      Sweet woodruff's pleasing scent only becomes apparent after      the leaves have been dried . . . but then it lasts for      years. The odor is due to coumarin, a chemical also found      in tonka beans, sweet clover or meliot, and some other      leguminous plants. In potpourris, since it not only adds a      fragrance of its own but acts as a fixative for other      s cents, woodruff's contri bution is twofold. Sachets of the      dried herb can be laid among the household linens; in an      earlier age, the leaves were even used to stuff mattresses.      (In addition to perfuming the bedclothes, the sachets were      reputed to repel insects, which must have made the herb a      popular commodity in the days when regular bathing was a      luxury!)<br />      <br />      Teutonic warriors believed that woodruff promoted success      in battle, and therefore tucked its green sprigs in their      helmets. The origin of this belief isn't clear: Perhaps it      stems from the fact that woodruff leaves are mildly      anesthetic and healing when applied externally (thus      helping a soldier to ignore his wounds) . . . or perhaps it      derived from the leaves' ability to "make the heart merry"      when taken in wine.<br />      <br />      Be that as it may, this charming little herb can substitute      for vanilla in various sauces and beverages. Marilyn      Hampstead, whose Fox Hill Farm is one source of      <em>Asperula</em> plants, reports that sweet woodruff can      be steeped in milk <em>-</em> overnight or for      several days <em>-</em> to make a refreshing drink      that's especially enjoyed by children . . . or, to impart a      vanilla taste, soaked in whatever liquid is required in a      given recipe . . . or, to make a delicious glaze for tarts      and turnovers, steeped in currant juice and strained out      before the juice is thickened by cooking with sugar.<br />      <br />      Woodruff grows to an average height of about eight inches      from a slender, creeping root-stock. Whorls of six to eight      slightly shiny, somewhat rough, pointed leaves surround the      square, glossy stem. Small, starry flowers appear in May      and June; later, the seeds ripen into little rough balls      covered with hooked bristles that cling to passersby. The      plants can be propagated by seed, but since the germination      period is so long (sometimes 200 days!), more satisfactory      results can be obtained by root division in the spring and      early summer (right after flowering). The herb prefers      moist, slightly acid, humusrich soil in a semi-shaded      location. Woodruff is quite finicky, so its conditions must      be met for it to survive . . . but once established, it      spreads to make a good ground cover. The leaves will be      most fragrant if harvested during and directly after      blooming. Chop them up and dry them immediately in a warm,      shaded area.    </p>    <p>      Many fine nurseries carry sweet woodruff plants, among them      [1] Hemlock Hill Herb Farm, Dept.
