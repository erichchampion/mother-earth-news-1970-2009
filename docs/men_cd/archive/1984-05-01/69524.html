                <p>      <em>Help your youngsters study elfin crawlers and pint-size      fliers by making this handy . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Marsha Goodwin    </h5>        <p>      Watching grasshoppers, beetles, centipedes, and all manner      of backyard minivteatuTes is a favorite summer pastime for      my children. Unfortunately, this sort of observation is too      often cut short when the viewed object abruptly scurries,      hops, or flutters out of sight. In an effort to help my      budding bug watchers prolong their studies, I came up with      the easyto-construct portable insect cage shown here. Now      my kids can capture all the insects they want . . . watch      them to their hearts' content . . . and then let the      critters go.<br />      <br />      To create a similar arthropod arena for your youngsters,      gather up the following: a 6" X 121/2" piece of screen wire      . . . a 4" X 6" piece of 1/2"-thick plywood . . . two 4" X      4-1/2" slabs of 3/4"-thick plywood . . . a pair of small      door hinges with screws to fit ... one hook-and-eye latch      ... a 6-1/2"long strip of metal hanger strap . . . a 1/2      "wide by 4 "-long scrap of felt . . . one cabinet handle      plus screws . . . some black electrical tape . . . several      dozen carpet tacks . . . and a handful of 2d nails.<br />      <br />      Begin construction by folding the electrical tape in. half      over all the edges of he screen wire (this not only looks      neat but will prevent children from getting scratched later      on). Then, with a saw, round the upper corners of the two      4" X 41/2" plywood boards that will form the ends of the      box. That done, cut a 3-1/2"-high by 2"-wide door from one      of the boards and affix it in its proper place, using the      small hinges.<br />      <br />      Now, nail the two 4" X 4-1/2" slabs to each end of the 4" X      6" plywood base. With this frame secure, start tacking the      screen to it, beginning along one side of the base and      working your way up the front and back walls      simultaneously, making sure to hammer the tacks through the      wire that's covered with tape. Continue tacking the sides      until you reach the middle of the top. Then take the 61/2"      hanger strap and stretch it across the "peak" of the box.      Tack it firmly to each end . . . lay the mesh down over it      . . . and attach the cabinet handle. When you have      completed that step, finish affixing the mesh so that you      have a tight, neat cage. (If all of this sounds      complicated, just use the picture accompanying this article      as a guide.)<br />      <br />      Finally, screw the hook to the door and the eye to the      wall, glue the felt strip to the inside of the wall where      the door swings open (to prevent small insects from      escaping between it and the wall), and-as an added personal      touch-paint your child's name onto one end of the      container. There you have it: a made-from-scratch bug box      ready for action! All you need now is a good field guide to      the insects in your area . . . and a couple of bug-curious      kids to test the contraption out.    </p>
