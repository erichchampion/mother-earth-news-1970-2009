                    <h5 id="byline">      by Paula Szilard    </h5>        <p>      At a time when almost everyone seems to be borrowing ideas      from Japan, is it possible that the people of that nation      could learn something from us? You bet it is! For      centuries, you see, the Japanese (and other Orientals) have      prepared tofu-the inexpensive soybean food that's low      in calories and saturated fats, free of cholesterol, rich      in vitamins and minerals, and high in protein-in      essentially the same ways. Without a doubt, many of those      traditional recipes are good tasting as well as nutritious      . . . but they're <em>not</em> the last word on tofu      cuisine. In less than a decade, Americans have adapted tofu      to the Western palate . . . and Occidental cooks have      really pioneered the development of a number of tofu      desserts. The creations include a mouth-watering array of      pies, cheesecakes, puddings, cakes, cookies, delicate      pastries, and even ice creams!<br />      <br />      Tofu-which can range from a soft, pudding-like      consistency to one that resembles pressed      cheese-lends itself especially well to pies of all      descriptions. Five of my favorites are presented here, each      of which calls for a baked crumb or nut crust and an      unbaked filling. I whip up the fillings in my food      processor (though you could use a blender or a mixer . . .      see the sidebar on blending techniques) and quickly gel      them, using powdered agar, another oriental import (you'll      find more information about agar in an accompanying      sidebar). And as for the taste of these delectable      concoctions . . . well, you'll just have to find out for      yourself. Try one or two of these recipes . . . and      celebrate the Western culinary imagination.</p>            <p>      What better way is there to herald summer than with a cool,      fruit-laden dessert? To make the crust for this pie, break      the graham crackers into small pieces and add them to the      work bowl of your food processor, along with the other dry      ingredients. Process the mixture until the crackers are      finely ground, then-with the machine still      running-add the oil and honey. Press the mixed      "dough" into a wellgreased 9-1/2" pie pan, coating first      the sides and then the bottom, and bake the shell in a      preheated 375°F oven for about 8 minutes, or until the      edges turn slightly brown.<br />      <br />      While the crust is baking and cooling, you can put together      the pie's filling. First, cook the dried apricots in 1-1/2      cups of water until they're soft but not mushy. Take out      the nine most attractive pieces to save for decorating the      top of the pie. Now, continue simmering the remaining      halves until all the water is taken up. Next, process the      fruit until it's smooth, then blend in the tofu and vanilla      extract. (If your machine has a small work bowl, you'll      need to mix the tofu in two batches and then use an      electric or rotary beater to combine them.) After setting      the fruitladen pudding aside, pour the remaining cup of      water and the honey into a small saucepan, mix them well,      and then sprinkle the powdered agar over the sweet liquid.      Let the gelling agent soften for a minute, bring the      mixture to a rolling boil, and cook it for 30 seconds. When      the time's up, remove the agar liquid from the heat and      allow it to cool for 5 to 8 minutes. Then-with the      food processor running-slowly pour the agar blend      into the tofu-apricot pudding, and mix the ingredients for      a few seconds. Let the filling set up in the refrigerator      for 15 to 20 minutes, then briefly process it again until      it's soft and creamy. Pour the filling into the cooled pie      shell and chill the dessert until it's firm.<br />      <br />      While the pie is setting up, rescue those set-aside apricot      halves and-in a small saucepan-combine them      with a few drops of almond extract and a tablespoon each of      honey and water. (You may substitute 1 tablespoon of white      wine, or the same measure of peach or apricot brandy, for      the almond extract and water.) Garnish the pie with the      glazed apricots and place a few mint leaves alongside the      fruit for added color. This mouth-watering dessert tastes      every bit as good as it looks!    </p>        <p>      Using the ingredients listed, prepare the crust for this      pie in the manner described in the preceding recipe. Pat      the crust onto a well-greased <em>springform</em> pan,      and-as before-bake it in a preheated 375°F      oven for about 8 minutes.<br />      <br />      Next, make the coconut milk by pouring 1 cup of boiling      water over 2 cups of coconut flakes. The coconut will still      appear somewhat dry, but don't add more water or the      resulting milk will be too thin. Let the mixture stand for      15 to 20 minutes.<br />      <br />      To make the filling, puree the bananas and add ascorbic      acid to retard their discoloration. Then, using two      thicknesses of good cheesecloth, squeeze most of the      moisture from the tofu cakes. After adding the tofu and      vanilla to the bananas, blend the ingredients well. By this      <em>time</em> the coconut should be sufficiently, soaked,      so-using the cheesecloth again-squeeze the      flakes over a measuring cup. If you fall short of the      needed 2/3 cup of liquid, pour in enough water to bring it      to the correct level. Now, combine the coconut milk and      honey in a small saucepan and sprinkle the powdered agar on      top. As before, allow the mixture to stand for a minute,      then bring it to a rolling boil for 30 seconds. When the      agar has cooled for 5 minutes, slowly pour it into the      tofu-banana blend, processing the ingredients as you add      them so that they're thoroughly mixed. Then pour the      filling into the cooled crust, cover the pie with plastic      wrap, and chill it for 15 minutes, or until the top is firm      to the touch.<br />      <br />      You can decorate the pie with banana slices and sections of      mandarin oranges, as shown, or come up with your own      design. For the glaze, combine the brown sugar, tapioca,      and agar in a saucepan . . . add the wine . . . and stir      the mixture until all the soluble ingredients are      dissolved. Now, bring the concoction to a rolling boil for      30 seconds, stirring it constantly to prevent sticking. Let      the mixture cool for a few minutes until it starts to      thicken, then spoon it over the decorated pie, being      careful to cover all the fruit. Chill the dessert      thoroughly before you serve it.    </p>          <p>      Again, this crust is prepared in the manner used for the      two preceding pies, with the changes in ingredients      indicated above. Press the crust into the bottom of a      well-greased 9-1/2" springform pan and bake it in a      preheated 375°F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until it      starts to brown around the edges.<br />      <br />      While the crust cools, squeeze most of the water out of the      tofu with a cheesecloth, then process the soybean curd,      extracts, and zest until the resulting batter is smooth and      creamy. Next, combine the orange juice, lemon juice,      liqueur, and honey in a small saucepan . . . sprinkle on      the agar . . . and-after allowing the gelling agent      to soften for a minute-boil the mixture for 30      seconds. When the agar liquid has cooled for about 5      minutes, slowly add it to the tofu mixture and process the      blend thoroughly. Then pour the filling into the cooled      crust, chill the pie, and garnish it with orange slices and      mint leaves.</p>              <p>    Here's the perfect dessert for the chocolate-lovers in your    clan. Begin making the crust by grinding the almonds in the    food processor, pulsing the machine on and off until the nuts    are chopped to a medium-fine size. Then add the remaining    ingredients and process the crust-makings until they are well    mixed. Press the nutmeat crust into the bottom of a    well-greased 9-1/2" springform pan and bake it in a preheated    375°F oven for 8 minutes.<br />    <br />    Now, using two thicknesses of cheesecloth, squeeze most of    the moisture out of the tofu. Blend the squeezed cakes until    they have a smooth, creamy consistency, then mix in the carob    powder, the vanilla extract, and the almond extract.<br />    <br />    With that done, combine the honey and water in a small    saucepan . . . sprinkle on the agar . . . let the mixture    stand a minute . . . and bring it to a rolling boil for 30    seconds. When the agar has cooled for 5 minutes, add it to    the tofu base and blend the ingredients thoroughly. Then pour    the filling into the cooled crust and chill the pie in the    refrigerator until it's firm.<br />    <br />    You can decorate your carob confection by piping a wavy    border of whipped cream around the pie's perimeter and    sculpting a rosette in the center, using a pastry bag fitted    with a star tip. Then, with the help of a potato peeler,    shave thin slivers of carob from a candy bar and sprinkle the    tidbits over the rosette. This pie is sure to draw a hungry    crowd . . . and it's likely to be devoured soon after the    last carob shavings are in place!</p>            <p>      Using the work bowl of your food processor, chop the nuts      and rolled oats to the consistency of coarse flour by      pulsing the machine on and off. After adding the flour,      oil, honey, and vanilla extract, mix everything well. Pat      the nutmeat crust into a 9-1/2" pie pan, and then bake the      shell in a preheated 375°F oven for 10 to 13      minutes.<br />      <br />      To make the filling, blend the tofu and vanilla extract      until they're smooth. Next, mix the water and maple syrup      together in a small saucepan, then sprinkle the powdered      agar on top and allow the gelling agent to soften in the      water for a minute. Now, bring the concoction to a rolling      boil for 30 seconds. When the agar mixture has cooled for 5      minutes, add it to the tofu, processing all the while to      blend the batter. Then toss in the chopped macadamia nuts,      pulsing the machine on and off a few times to mix them in,      and pour the filling into the cooled pie shell. Dabs of      whipped cream and sprinkles of roasted, chopped nuts lend      the final touches to the dessert.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If these recipes whet your appetite for      more tofu cuisine, take a look at Louise Hagler's</em> Tofu      Cookery <em>(The Book Publishing Company, $9.95). This      compendium of recipes for all phases of a meal includes      step-by-step directions for making tofu at home and      instructions for freezing, marinating, and handling the      product. And for a very thorough treatment of tofu and      other soy foods, you'll want to read</em> The Book of Tofu      <em>by William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi (Autumn Press,      $11.95). Excerpts from this noteworthy volume appeared in      MOTHER NOS. 39-45. Both books are available from      bookstores, or-for the list prices plus $1.50 for      shipping and handling for 1 or 2 books, $2.00 for 3 or      more-from Mother's Bookshelf (restricted) , 105 Stoney      Mountain Rd., Hendersonville, NC 28791.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Blending Techniques    </h3>    <p>      <em>Although the recipes given in this article call for the      use of a food processor, the pies can be made using a      blender, an electric mixer, or even a rotary beater. For      crumb or nut crusts, you'll probably want to chop the nuts      or graham crackers separately before combining all the dry      ingredients in a bowl (with the favor extracts, honey, and      such) and mixing the dough with a wooden spoon.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Blenders and electric mixers generally don't handle      tofu well unless some liquid is added. When using a      standard home blender, mash the tofu before mixing it . . .      and work with no more than half a pound at once. A good      rule of thumb for the recipes given here is to blend a      third of the ingredients at a time. Put the honey in first      and gradually add the fruit and tofu. Then combine the      separate blender batches in a bowl and add any flavor      extracts. Because you'll have less liquid left to boil the      agar in, you'll need to shorten the agar's cooling time to      1 to 2 minutes. Then, with the mixer running, slowly pour      the agar liquid into the tofu in a steady stream and      proceed as directed in the recipe.</em> In no case should      you allow the agar to set before blending it into the tofu.    </p>    <h3>About Agar</h3>    <p>      <em>Also called agar-agar or Ceylon moss, this natural      seaweed extract is used in the same way as gelatin.      However, agar is superior to the more common gelling agent      in several respects. Agar doesn't require the usual      combination of hot and cold water to set up: Instead, it      hardens at 85°F, gelling foods at room temperature. And      because agar will hold its form at up to 180°F, it's      ideal for use in dishes stored at room temperature. For      this reason, desserts made with agar are especially suited      for summer potluck outings, because they won't melt before      your eyes.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>There are several different types of agar on the      market: stick agar (or kanten), flakes, strips, and      powdered agar. By far the easiest to use is the powdered      form. Like the stick agar, the pulverized product is      extremely reliable, and-unlike kanten-it      doesn't require a soaking period before it can be used. As      for the other choices, agar strips are difficult to deal      with because they're hard to measure in small quantities .      . . and the flakes don't always yield consistent      results.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Agar is generally available at natural foods stores and      co-ops.</em>    </p>
