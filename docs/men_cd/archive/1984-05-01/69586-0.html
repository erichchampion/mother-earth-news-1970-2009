        [1]If you're careful, you can split two usable bow staves from a single sapling of about 1"" diameter. In the right hands, a larger sapling or limb can be split into four staves. All subse quent shaping must be done with abraders; whittling can weaken the wood and may cause nicks. [2] Use a rasp to work the handle down to a size and shape that feel comfortable in your hand. Thin and taper the limbs gradually toward the bow tips. There is no one best size or shape for a traditional American Indian bow, but strength and aesthetics should be taken into account. [3]With the basic shaping of the bow completed, it's time to check the evenness of limb-pull. Tie a stout cord from end to end of the bow, place your bare foot on the handle, and pull up gently. If one limb is stronger than the other, carefully abrade away belly wood until the limbs pull evenly. [4] To put the curve in a recurved bow . . . boil the bow tip for four hours, then place it over the convex side of a 2 X 4 form. Lock the tip in place with a C clamp, then bend the limb around the form and lock it down with a second clamp. Allow at least 24 hours before removing the clamps.
