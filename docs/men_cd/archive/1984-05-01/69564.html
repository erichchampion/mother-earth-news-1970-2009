                <p>      Issue # 87 - May/June 1984 <em>Slip-joint plumbing may have      a place not only under your house but in it, as well.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>In MOTHER NO. 85 (page 148), we featured a design for      an old-timey pie safe offered to us by The Family Workshop.      For the spring season, the Oklahoma-based outfit has worked      up this plastic-pipe porch glider, which the Workshop folks      feel will have as much appeal to MOM's readers as it did to      the fans of their own crafts books and syndicated newspaper      columns.</em></p><h5 id="byline">by Stevie Baldwin</h5>        <p>      If front porches were made for lazy spring and summer      evenings, then gliders were made for front porches . . .      and though it may seem that the swinging settee has gone      the way of Rhett and Scarlett, there's no reason why you      can't rediscover its pleasures by re-creating this leisure      lounge, using modern materials.<br />      <br />      I'd suspect that the earliest gliders were made of      hardwoods, which eventually gave way to steel with the      onslaught of mass production. But our updated version      consists mainly of plastic plumbing pipe (polyvinyl      chloride, or PVC for short), which has the admirable      qualities of strength, workability, reasonable cost, and      universal availability.<br />      <br />      There are, however, a few important things you ought to      know about the components before you get into the "swing"      of things. First off, there are seven different      formulations of plastic pipe, only two of which-PVC      and its chlorinated cousin, CPVC-will be used for      this project. (Each is available in a rigid, thick-wall      design that is ideal for furniture building.)<br />      <br />      Second, like conventional steel pipe, PVC is      measured-nominally-by its internal diameter . .      . but the <em>outside</em> dimension of similarly sized      plastic pipe remains the same, regardless of the thickness      of its wall. Theoretically, this allows the      <em>fittings</em> in each size group to share the same      inside diameter . . . but don't count on it: Minor      tolerance differences between various manufacturers'      hardware make it necessary to prefit the pipe and fittings      prior to purchase. If a joint is too sloppy (or excessively      tight), it would be advisable to try another fitting.<br />      <br />      While on the subject of joints, be aware that you can build      disassembly capability into this piece of furniture by      locking the unions with self-tapping metal screws rather      than cement. But should you choose to go the permanent (and      far stronger) route, the mating surfaces must be prepared      by roughing them lightly with fine sandpaper or steel wool      (or cleaning them with plastic pipe primer) before they're      chemically welded together. It is equally important to use      the correct primer and cement for the type of pipe you're      working with, since PVC and CPVC each use specific      solvents. Moreover, once the mating surfaces are bonded,      they're joined for good . . . so be careful not to paint      yourself into a corner, so to speak, by gluing an assembly      together without a trial fit. You may discover that the      last section of pipe cannot be squeezed between two      fittings, no matter how hard you try.    </p>        <p>      Finally, you don't have to settle for the PVC's standard      white, gray, or cream colors. Once the frame's assembled,      you can wipe it down with turpentine, then spray it with an      oil-based primer and several finishing coats in whatever      color you choose. Or in contrast to this, you might want to      go for the "high-tech" look by leaving the surfaces      unpainted and the printing on the pipe walls exposed. Yet      another option is to take a clean and simple approach by      removing the lettering with some automotive choke cleaner      and a dry rag.<br />      <br />      OK, so now you're an armchair authority on plastic pipe . .      . the next step is to pay a visit to your local plumbing      supply or hardware store and pick up the following      materials: 26 feet of 2" rigid PVC pipe, 20 feet of the      same blend in 1-1/2" diameter, and 40 feet of 3/4" rigid      CPVC piping. To complete the joints, you'll also need a      total of twenty-eight 2" PVC fittings (six 90° elbows,      ten T's, eight Y's, and four end caps), eighteen 1-1/2"      fixtures (four 90° elbows, ten T's, and four end caps),      and a can of PVC cement.<br />      <br />      While you're at it, you'll also need to purchase eight      5/16" X 4" galvanized eyebolts . . . an equal number of      flat washers, hex nuts, and cap nuts to fit those fasteners      . . . and about three feet of 3/16" coil chain. You may      also want to get eight connecting links to join the chain      to the eyebolts, but it's possible to save that expense by      merely opening the fasteners' eyes with a pair of pliers,      inserting the chain loops, and reclosing the eyes.<br />      <br />      Before heading on home to piece together your project,      you'll have to swing by the fabric shop to pick out 4 yards      of 60"-wide upholstery material (a heavy cotton would be      fine), 3 yards of 1" ribbon that complements the fabric,      about 10 yards of standard quilt batting, one pound of      polyester fiberfill, and some heavy-duty thread. With that      done, all you'll need in order to get started is a      measuring tape, a marking pen, a hacksaw, a needle and some      straight pins, a couple of pairs of pliers, a drill with a      5/16" bit, and a 7/8" diameter hole saw.<br />      <br />      It's pretty easy to see how the various parts of the glider      fit together by referring to the exploded drawing . . . and      that illustration can also be used to determine the lengths      to which you'll have to cut each "raw" section of pipe.      Beyond that, there are just a few things you might want to      keep in mind as you slip-joint your settee together.<br />      <br />      To help organize matters, it'd probably be a good idea to      approach this project as three independent tasks,      concentrating on building the glider's frame, seat, and      cushion sets separately. The frame is a freestanding      structure from which the glider seat is suspended, and it's      composed of five sections: two identical side assemblies, a      pair of horizontal leg members, and a back rail. All the      components of this sub-assembly are made from 2" PVC pipe      and fittings, and the lengths indicated assume a standard      fitting socket depth of 3/4". Note that you'll need to cut      a total of twenty 1-3/8"-long connecting stubs to join      adjacent fittings together; if any of your fittings have      "odd" collars, you may have to adjust the length to      compensate for any differences in their design.    </p>        <p>      I found it easiest to make the two side assemblies first      (starting with their back posts and working forward), and      then to work on the leg sections, beginning at the corners.      After finishing the back rail, it wasn't too difficult to      connect the sides to the leg sections one at a time and to      wrap up by slipping that rear bar into place. Again, I      can't overstress the importance of prefitting the parts to      their mates before you even touch the glue pot . . . not      just to check the soundness of the joints, but to      familiarize yourself with the most effective order of      assembly.<br />      <br />      Once the frame was together and the cement had dried, I      bored two 5/16" holes through the upper tube of each side      section (the front ones just behind the elbows and those at      the rear set 3" before the T's) to accommodate the four      frame eyebolts. To prevent any eye (or arm!) sores, I      covered the exposed ends of each inverted fastener with a      cap nut.<br />      <br />      The seat, like the frame, can be broken down into sections:      the back, the front, the cushion support bars, and the      arms. With the exception of the support bars, which are      made of lengths of 3/4" CPVC, the seat is constructed      entirely of 1-1/2" PVC pipe and fittings. The only trick in      getting these together is to mind the fact that the support      bars just slip-without glue-into 7/8" holes      drilled through one side of each of the horizontal pipes      that form the seat's back and front rails.<br />      <br />      You'll notice that the tube at the crook of the seat has to      accommodate the back <em>and</em> bottom support bars, so      it's important to stagger the upper holes in relation to      the forward-facing ones. In each case, the bores are spaced      3-3/4" apart (measured from their centers) . . . but the      bottom is composed of eleven bars, while the back has only      ten. Consequently, if both sets of holes are centered on      the pipe, the openings will automatically fall in an      alternating pattern.<br />      <br />      Feel free to experiment, but you'll probably discover, as I      did, that the seat will go together painlessly if you start      with the back, working on the verticals from the bottom up      . . . add the ten back support bars . . . and cap the array      with the upper rail. Then you can go on to assemble the      front rail (making sure the eleven holes and the fitting      sockets face in the same direction) and join it to the      completed back section with the seat supports and arm tubes      between. The four remaining eyebolts can then be attached      through the end caps at the corners and the entire seat      hung from the frame with 8" lengths (more or less) of      chain.<br />      <br />      The glider's cushion is held in place by a sleeve that      slips over the top of the seat back. You can refer to the      cutting pattern to size your material correctly. After      you've trimmed out the two main (front and back) pieces and      a 13-1/2" X 48" sleeve piece, you can pin and then stitch      the sections together.<br />      <br />      This is most easily accomplished by first laying one      cushion half (which will be the bottom) right side up on a      flat surface, covering that with the face-up sleeve (you'll      have to form a 1"-wide, double-turned hem along one long      edge of it, and face that toward the center of the fabric),      then placing the remaining cushion half on top, face down.      The seam opposite the sleeve piece should be left unsewn to      provide access for the quilt batting, which can be cut to      shape and then stacked inside the completed cushion once      it's turned right side out.<br />      <br />      When the padding is smoothed in place, that final seam can      be whipstitched shut and the length of 1" ribbon cut in two      to form two 1-1/2-yard pieces . . . which should each be      folded in half and attached, at the fold, to the edge of      the cushion sleeve. The four strands thus created can be      tied to the pipe at the base of the seat once the pad's      installed.<br />      <br />      If you want pillow cushions, you'll need to cut two 14" X      18" pieces of fabric for each one. Simply pin the halves      right side together and stitch a 1"-wide seam along all the      edges except for one short one. Then turn the pillowcase      right side out, stuff it with fiberfill, and whipstitch the      remaining seam edges together.<br />      <br />      The final product, though not dirt cheap by any means      (it'll cost about $150 to reproduce), is a functional and      cleanly attractive piece of furniture that-depending      on your taste-might serve double duty between your      porch and an indoor family room as the seasons make their      circuit.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If the idea of PVC furniture strikes      your fancy, you'll be pleased to know that The Family      Workshop (P.O. Box 159, Bixby, OK 74008) is offering a      ten-item PVC project package for $12. It includes detailed      assembly plans, not only for the glider described in Stevie      Baldwin's article but for nine other pieces . . . a chaise      longue, a lawn chair, a footstool, an end table, a yard      swing, a picnic table, bunk beds, a child's desk, and an      étagère. The entire plans package (specify      Project No. 3266-2) is available from the address above . .      . as is The Family Workshop's $2.95 color catalog that      features hundreds of additional woodworking and needlecraft      projects.</em>    </p>

The taste ful use of some oil-based paint and a coordinating fabric makes a world of difference, turning what would normally be a piece of outdoor furniture into an attractive indoor appointment as well.
