                    <p>      <strong>SOUTHERN-FRIED HIGHWAYS?</strong></p><p>      A truck rolling down Interstate 75 last December lost a      small part of its load near Crossville, Tennessee. The      <em>unlabeled</em> canister contained radioactive material      that posed a "very serious danger" to anyone who might pick      it up. Fortunately, the missing cargo was found . . . but      only after a 12-hour search by authorities who combed 200      miles of blacktop with ultrasensitive radiation detectors.    </p>        <p>      <strong>UNCLE SAM SWAPS</strong>      <br />      In years to come, the Department of Defense may      <em>barter</em> for goods for the nation's defensive      stockpile. Government officials are reviewing current      policies in an effort to determine whether      <em>swapping</em> for the necessary commodities might help      make up for the deficit in funds specifically appropriated      for the task. Unfortunately, about the only thing the feds      have to barter with is land, often publicly owned. Would      you trade a piece of Yellowstone for a Jeep?<br />      <br />      <strong>BLESSING OR BLIGHT?</strong>    </p>        <p>      While Florida, Louisiana, and Texas spend more than $11      million a year to curb the spread of the prolific water      hyacinth, San Diego has invested $3.5 million to cultivate      the plant for waste-water treatment. This South American      native can double its bulk in a couple of weeks, choking      waterways and threatening native species . . . but the      plant also thrives on nitrates, phosphates, and potassium,      all of which are common water pollutants.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE WIDENING GYRE</strong><br />      <br />      On the appropriate technology front, underwater explorer      Jacques Cousteau has designed a new, wind-powered vessel to      replace the aging Calypso. The Moulin à Vent (French      for windmill) operates with a revolutionary 44-foot      cylinder that serves as a mast and deflects wind to propel      the ship. Four to five times more efficient than sail, the      cylinder allows the Moulin à Vent to stand still or      even to back up - unlike a conventional sailboat.      Although 50-knot winds tore the mast from the deck of the      vessel in an October Caribbean storm, Cousteau plans a      transatlantic run this September.    </p>        <p>      <strong>LYNX LIES LOW</strong><br />      <br />      Suburban life often seems to agree with raccoon, skunk, and      even deer - but wildcats? A missing lynx, stolen from      the Sacramento Zoo last September, was recently found alive      and well and living in a suburban garage in the California      capital. The family that owns the home has no idea how the      cat got there, and police have no leads on who took the      animal from the zoo in the first place.<br />      <br />      <strong>NIX ON NEW-CAR SMELL</strong><br />      <br />      That evocative fragrance of plastic given off by new cars      may soon belong to the realm of nostalgia if the EPA      decides to ban the most commonly used chemical plasticizer,      DEHP. Plasticizers emit the characteristic newcar odor and      give plastic materials their flexibility. Unfortunately,      some of them - notably DEHP - also cause cancer      in rats and mice, according to the National Cancer      Institute. Incidentally, most human exposure to DEHP      actually occurs from eating foods that absorbed the      chemical during processing or from packaging material.      Hamburger and prepared meats are a couple of such      sources.<br />      <br />      <strong>ELECTORAL ENTREPRENEURS</strong>    </p>        <p>      He may never have told a lie, but George Washington did ply      Virginia voters with rum punch, wine, and beer during the      House of Burgesses election in 1757. Following in the      tradition of the father of our country, the Political      Action Committees (PAC's) of the 1980's will offer much      more to American legislators. PAC's are groups of people      interested in influencing our Representatives and Senators      in certain ways, and their leverage is purchased: The      anti-PAC organization Common Cause estimates that PAC's      contributed $80 million to congressional candidates in      1982. From 1974 to 1982, the number of PAC's grew from 608      to more than 3,400. We have Bacpac, Peacepac, and Cigarpac.      And beer distributors have a committee called - what      else?-SixPac.<br />      <br />      <strong>ODOROUS AWARD</strong>    </p>        <p>      Is the smell of rotten eggs near the top of the "world's      most offensive odor" list? Some Louisiana farmers think so,      and they're backing thought with action by spraying their      soybean fields with a diluted egg mixture. It seems that      the wafting stench of overripe eggs keeps deer from      nibbling on the tender young soybean plants.<br />      <br />      <strong>MUFFINS, MUFFINS, WHO'S GOT THE      MUFFINS?</strong><br />      <br />      EPA investigators recently found 775 parts per billion      (ppb) of EDE in cornmeal mix taken off the shelf of a      Florida grocery store. EDB - or ethylene dibromide      - is a pesticide that the EPA has described as the      most powerful cancer-causing compound they've ever tested.      Florida law prohibits the sale of food products containing      more than <em>one</em> ppb of EDB. William Ruckleshaus,      director of the EPA, has instituted a partial ban on EDB      - with more studies to follow.<br />      <br />      <strong>ILL-REPUTE FIELD</strong><br />      <br />      Eastern Oregon residents recently petitioned the government      to restore Naughty Girl Meadow's original name. Once called      Whorehouse Meadow in honor of ladies who camped there      during the sheepshearing season, the meadow was renamed in      the 1960's by a traveling surveyor who thought the original      too racy. Locals believe that Whorehouse Meadow captures      the "color" of the area. A decision should be coming from      the U.S. Board on Geographical Names soon.    </p>        <p>      <strong>LADYBUG, LADYBUG</strong><br />      <br />      In the late 1880's, the West Coast's fledgling citrus      industry faced disaster. The cottony-cushion scale, an      Australian pest, had found its way to the Golden State and      was threatening to suck the life from California's citrus      trees. Entomologists soon discovered, however, that the      scale wasn't a problem in its native land, thanks to the      Australian ladybird beetle, which fed voraciously on the      pest. The importation of ladybugs was an instant success,      with offspring of the first insect immigrants selling for      as much as $2.00 per beetle!<br />      <br />      The biological control of insects can be used at home to      fight many common house and garden pests. "Biological Pest      Management for Interior Plantscapes" - which is      available for $2.00 from the Alberta Environmental Center,      Vegreville, Alberta, Canada T0B 4L0 - describes how      to control certain whiteflies, aphids, mealybugs, scales,      and mites by releasing <em>beneficial</em> insects (such as      green lacewing larvae and ladybugs).<br />      <br />      <strong>CHEMICAL WARFARE</strong><br />      <br />      In Berlin, the big news is the air pollution coming over      the wall that divides the city, according to <em>The Amicus      Journal</em> . The East Germans are sending over      carcinogenic fumes from brown coal and chemicals, and      exhaust from two-stroke automobile engines. On bad days,      the West Berlin government frequently is forced to declare      smog alerts and to urge young children and asthmatics to      stay inside.<br />      <br />      Although the worst environmental conditions appear to be in      East Germany and Poland, the Soviet Union is beginning to      acknowledge that it, too, has problems. Siberia's Lake      Baikal, which contains one of the world's largest supplies      of fresh water, is now protected. But other regions of      Siberia are supposedly so badly polluted as a result of the      Russian industrialization program that people are refusing      to live there.    </p>        <p>      <strong>FARMER STOPS NUKE</strong><br />      <br />      A 43-year-old farmer has managed to halt the construction      of a nuclear power plant near her home in the Regensburg,      West Germany region, making her the first person to      single-handedly stop the building of a nuke in that      country. Franziska Beck filed suit in a West German court,      charging that her basic rights were violated by the      construction of the reactor. The court decided, among other      things, that the public hadn't been allowed to participate      sufficiently in the licensing process. The plant's      contractors will, of course, appeal the decision.<br />      <br />      <strong>1983 RETROSPECTIVE</strong><br />      <br />      Last year's drought was one of the worst in recorded      history, with once-productive land turning to desert all      over the planet. Natural scientists are pegging some of the      blame for desertification on human activity. Poor      cultivation practices, deforestation, overgrazing, and the      overuse of marginal land are all being cited as causes of      the problem. But on the positive side, reports from United      Nations groups indicate that some 3.24 billion trees were      planted in 14 countries during the UN's "For Every Child a      Tree" program. Let's hope we can keep that effort going!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The worldwide organization called Friends of      the Earth is one of the most effective environmental groups      in existence today, and the activities of FOE - along      with a broad range of other news concerning ecological      developments - are described each month in its      publication titled Not Man Apart .
