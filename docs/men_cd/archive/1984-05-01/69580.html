                <p>      <em>Caring for your backyard growing plot can be as easy as      one, two, three if you have . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Elizabeth Fern    </h5>        <h3>      THE HOSE GUARD    </h3>    <p>      Empty plastic containers have long served double duty in      the garden . . . but here's an idea you might not have      tried: Cut the bottom out of a round, empty, one-quart      plastic bottle (for instance, the kind of jug that fabric      softener is often marketed in), and place the vessel over a      row-marking stake. With a nail driven through its metal cap      to act as a pivot, the round receptacle will be able to      turn freely on the wooden marker as it guards your plants      from the garden hose.</p>      <h3>      DIBBLES AND CORD</h3>      <p>      To cobble up this multipurpose tool, sharpen one end of      each of two 10"-12" sections from the wooden handle of a      discarded tool, and drill a hole 6" from the      <em>nonpointed</em> end of each truncheon. Use one of these      "dibbles" to form seed furrows and to drill holes for onion      sets or bulbs . . . or connect a pair of dibbles with a      cord to make a row marker.</p>      <h3>SAVE YOUR KNEES</h3>      <p>      This device could make the difference between staying with      that gardening chore until it's finished . . . and limping      back to the kitchen and letting the weeds win. Constructed      of exterior-grade plywood, the knee saver features a      6"-wide, 6"-deep tool compartment that's ideal for holding      small potted plants, seed packets, hand tools, and gloves .      . . and a 4"-thick foam-rubber cushion that's protected      from wear by a plastic garbage bag. The 20" X 20" platform      is mounted on 1"-wide wooden runners to keep moist soil      from caking on the bottom . . . and a rope handle makes the      kneeler easy to store. If it's put together with brass      screws and finished with a coat of exterior enamel, this      handy garden helper should last for years.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For more about gardening aids and for a      discussion of specific techniques for the elderly or      handicapped, turn to page 70.
