                <p>      <em>Here's a bit of do-it-yourself "magic" that can make an      ugly view look bright and beautiful.</em>    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">		by Virginia Baysden and MOTHER's staff		</h5>                <p>      We like to think of windows as the eyes of a house . . .      gazing out over a beautiful landscape or fascinating city      scene that soothes or stimulates our spirits. But in      today's crowded world, that's just not often the case.      Frequently, homes or apartments have windows that overlook      unattractive <em>-</em> if not downright      <em>ugly</em> <em>-</em> views or, worse yet, that      reveal neighboring living rooms or bedrooms with intrusive      clarity. To cope with the problem, people resort to such      things as permanently drawn curtains, shades, "glass      curtains", frosted glass, or painstakingly applied adhesive      gel. There's another choice available, though, and it      should have special appeal to needleworkers and crafts      people. It's what I call <em>window stitchery</em>      <em>-</em> fabric "stained glass" that can be made      permanent or portable.<br />      <br />      Window stitchery provides a unique solution to the problem      of dealing with an unsightly view. It's inexpensive, but it      does require time and a moderate amount of skill in such      things as sketching a pattern; tracing, cutting, and sewing      the component fabric pieces; and stretching the finished      work over a wooden frame to be inserted in a window. But      oh, the lovely results! Like magic, your fabric picture      screens out the view, replacing it with a back-lit design      made especially for the room it occupies. In addition, your      stitchery can act as a shade for an overbright area and      provide a certain amount of insulation. It has some of the      character of true stained glass without any of the cost or      difficulty involved in the cutting of glass and soldering      of metals . . . and it allows for great individuality of      design.<br />      <br />      <strong>BEGIN WITH A FRAME</strong><br />      <br />      Most displays of graphic art begin with the picture, but in      window stitchery you begin with the frame. You'll need      eight strips of lath or molding, 1" wide and 1/2" thick,      cut to the size of your window. Because glazing frames are      often out of square, you'll need to measure all four sides      separately. Lay the measuring tape along the casement where      you plan to have the stitchery touch. You'll need two      strips of wood for each of the four sides, the first strip      equal in length to the exact measurement of the side, and      the second strip 2" shorter (see Fig. 1). You can either      cut these yourself or have it done at your local lumber      supplier or millwork company. Be sure to label each piece      clearly: On the rough side (which will be covered when the      framing is finished), write "Top-Long", "Top-Short", and so      on.<br />      <br />      <strong>SCHEME, PLOT, AND PURCHASE</strong><br />      <br />      The next step is to create the picture design. For this      you'll need a large sheet of paper (brown wrapping paper,      newspaper, or opened grocery bags will do), some masking      tape, a pencil, and a black marker pen. Spread the paper on      the floor or a large tabletop, and on it lay four of the      wooden strips, the long top and bottom and the short right      and left sides, to make the window shape. Tape the strips      together at the corners, then use your marker to draw the      inside dimensions of the frame onto the paper. The "stained      glass" design should fill the space completely.<br />      <br />      Now, set the wooden strips aside while you work on the      picture. Use a pencil to sketch the design of your choice      onto the paper, extending it about 1" beyond the marked      frame dimensions. For ease of construction and a look of      elegance, keep the drawing as clear and simple as possible.      Once the design is drawn to your satisfaction, go over the      penciled lines with the black marker. Number or letter each      section of the drawing, then use crayons or other colored      markers to indicate the hues you want in each      section.<br />      <br />      With that done, it's time to begin tracing, cutting, and      sewing. [ <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> The following procedure      imitates, to some degree, the manner in which stained-glass      panels are put together. Another method, which some people      may find easier, is described in the accompanying sidebar.]      Using heavy tracing paper or fine, sturdy muslin, trace the      individual sections of your design. Now, add a cutting line      1" beyond each outline. Mark each section with the number      or letter that indicates its place in the design and cut it      out.<br />      <br />      Next, sort the various pattern pieces by color. Lay out all      those of the same hue as if they were on a length of 36" or      45" fabric, putting the pieces close together but not      overlapping, and measure the amount of space they take up.      This will give you an idea of how much fabric you'll need      for each color.<br />      <br />      <strong>SELECTING A JOINER<br /></strong><br />      In real stained-glass windows or panels, sections of glass      are joined together with strips of metal. In window      stitchery, the pieces of fabric are sewn together, and then      black, silver, or color-coordinated strips of bias binding      are stitched over the seams to conceal them. A measuring      wheel or a cloth tape measure can be used to figure the      amount of binding required; just add several inches to the      total <em>-</em> about 1" per each separate strip      used <em>-</em> to allow for overlapping the      ends.<br />      <br />      Since the picture will be seen from the inside <em>and</em>      the outside of the house, you may want it to be reversible.      In that case, you should double the amount of binding you      purchase to allow for covering the seam lines on the      reverse side.<br />      <br />      After you've selected the binding you'll use, you may want      to paint the wooden frame strips a matching color for a      more finished appearance.<br />      <br />      <strong>CONSTRUCTING THE PICTURE</strong><br />      <br />      With all your materials on hand, lay the paper pattern      pieces on the appropriate colored fabrics and pin them in      place. Cut out the fabric sections and leave the patterns      af fixed to them until you're ready to join the sections      together.<br />      <br />      Start by pinning and sewing the innermost sections. You can      use lapped seams or double topstitched seams (see Fig. 2)      if you're working with a sewing machine, or a      round-and-round whipstitch if you're doing the picture by      hand (trim the seam allowance to 1/2" before whipstitching,      or there'll be too much fabric to deal with). Seams joined      by machine should be folded before being stitched, or      trimmed afterward so that a 1/2" bias binding strip will      cover them completely.<br />      <br />      Continue joining the picture sections until the entire      design has been completed, ironing each seam as it's done.      When all sections have been sewn together, begin covering      the shortest seams with binding, remembering to allow      enough length so each cut end can be covered by another      binding strip where the two cross. Tackle the longest seams      last and cover all the raw ends of the shorter binding      strips with the final long strips. If your picture is to be      reversible, repeat the process on the opposite side.<br />      <br />      <strong>ALL TOGETHER NOW<br /></strong><br />      With the painted (front) sides of the wooden frame pieces      face down, lay the long top and bottom and the short right      and left strips in place on top of your original design.      Put a dab of glue on the butt ends where they join and tape      the strips at the corners. Lay the completed stitchery on      top of the frame with the edges overlapping the wood      pieces. Then staple the upper edge to the top strip of wood      at every point where the binding extends onto the frame.      Gently stretch the picture down to the bottom of the frame,      and staple the ends of all binding strips that run from top      to bottom of the picture. Next, staple the ends of binding      strips that run from one side of the picture to the other,      alternating from the left to the right side of the frame as      you work your way down the picture. Keep the tension as      even as possible as you go. Last, staple the ends of short      binding strips wherever they extend over the wooden      frame.<br />      <br />      Once the binding is secured, proceed in the same manner      with the fabric. When you're done, you can reinforce the      staples by gluing the fabric edges to the frame. Finally,      trim off any excess material.<br />      <br />      Now, take the remaining four wood strips and lay them in      place, face up, on top of the stitchery. The corners of the      two frame sets will overlap (Fig. 3). Nail the two sets of      frames together at the ends of the strips as shown, using      1/2" or 3/8" finishing nails. Wood putty will fill and      cover any unwanted marks or crevices: Apply it, let it dry,      sand it smooth, and paint over it if it's in an area that      will show.<br />      <br />      As a final touch, spray the stitchery with a      water-and-grime repellent (test the substance first on      swatches of leftover fabric to be sure it's safe to use).      This protection will allow you to clean the picture as      needed.    </p>        <p>      <strong>INSTALLING THE STITCHERY</strong><br />      <br />      Some windows will allow you to simply press the stitchery      in place, while others will force you to use a few nails.      If there's no stress on the picture, it'll need little more      than to be tacked to the window casement. If, on the other      hand, you want to be able to open and close the window      that's being covered, just attach the stitchery with hinges      at the top or along one side. A latch or similar closure      will hold the frame shut when the window isn't in      use.<br />      <br />      <strong>CREATIVE WIZARDRY</strong><br />      <br />      Stitchery may not be the answer for every person or every      problem window, but it does have the power to transform an      ugly view into something bright, beautiful, and unique. It      costs little, and you don't have to be an expert at drawing      or sewing to make it work!    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S Method</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>We wanted to produce a window stitchery in order to      test the construction techniques presented here</em> and      <em>to have a finished piece to photograph. Accordingly,      the project was put in the capable hands of craftswoman      Pamela Phillips, who designed and stitched the clown      picture shown above . . . and in the process devised what      she felt was a faster and easier way of doing the job.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Pam's technique reflects her quilting experience: She      saw the stitchery as an appliqué project. She began      with the purchase of four panels of sheer drapery fabric.      Three of these were used as color sections in the design,      while the other, a rectangle larger than the window frame,      was marked to size and used as a background for the entire      picture.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>After creating the basic design, Pam traced it onto a      clean sheet of paper, using heavy marker lines. Instead of      cutting out individual paper pattern pieces for each of the      picture's sections, she used washable fabric marker to      trace each segment directly onto the appropriate colored      material. (The heavy marker lines showed through the      fabrics without difficulty.) Pam then cut the pieces out,      leaving about a 1/2" seam allowance around the edges.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Referring to her basic drawing, Pam then arranged the      colored fabric pieces on the background material and pinned      them in place. Next, she appliqued the pieces onto the      background, using the zigzag stitch on her sewing machine      and following the seam lines she had traced. With that      done, she used a pair of small, sharp scissors to trim away      the excess material around the outlines. The picture was      then made reversible by flipping it over and trimming away      the background fabric to allow the colored sections to show      clearly. The binding was applied in the same manner as      described in the article, except that marker lines were      drawn - and binding applied - on some of the      open background areas to imitate stained-glass      leading.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Although this technique doesn't follow the      piecet-o-piece joinery of the original method, which is      closer to genuine stained-glass methods, Pam feels it makes      complicated designs and curved seams easier to handle,      eliminates the puckering that could occur so readily with      piecing, and results in a smoother seam line on which to      sew the binding trim.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Pam estimated that the entire operation, from start to      finish, took her about 17 hours (including the time spent      shopping for supplies) and cost approximately $7.00 (not      including wood or paint, both of which she had on      hand).</em>    </p>
