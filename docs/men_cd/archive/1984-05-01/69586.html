                <p>      <em><strong>Any archery fan can add more enjoyment to the      sport by homecrafting primitive equipment.</strong></em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Tom Brown Jr    </h5>        <p>      I'm an ardent primitive hunter. That is, I pursue game as      the American Indians did: I pick up an animal's trail,      identifying species, size, and (sometimes) sex . . . stalk      the prey to within pulse-quickening distance . . . and      bring it down with a well-placed arrow.<br />      <br />      Now bow-hunting is a challenge in itself, but the      experience can be further enhanced by <em>making</em> your      bow and arrows, using - as far as possible -      the same materials, tools, and techniques that have been      employed by bowyers for millennia. Of course, any number of      excellent bows are available on the market today, but it's      my opinion that no factory-made item can match the look and      feel of a handcrafted bow.<br />      <br />      I've fashioned many different types of bows, each designed      to fit a special hunting need: short, highly reflexed,      sinew-backed weapons like those developed by the American      Plains Indians . . . long, recurved wooden bows in the      style of those used by Eastern Woodlands Indians . . .      English longbows . . . and models that borrow features from      several other types.    </p>        <p>      As a professional tracker, stalker, and close-range hunter      (I teach these skills for a living), I prefer a bow that's      recurved like an Eastern Woodlands model but shorter, with      sinew backing - for strength and longevity -      and a twisted-sinew bowstring. Shorter bows are easier to      handle when I'm stalking through heavy brush and making      close shots with a minimum of elbowroom. For rainy-day      hunting, however, I'm frequently forced to use a longer      recurved bow that's fitted with a plant-fiber bowstring,      which resists moisture-induced stretching. For bow fishing,      on the other hand, I prefer a longish self - or      straight - bow.<br />      <br />      Of course, most folks can't afford the luxury of owning      three different bows . . . unless they <em>make</em> the      weapons. So I'm going to tell you how to construct your own      archery tackle, using (for the most part) the techniques of      the American Indians . . . with frequent hints on how to      speed up the process when you're in a hurry. Keep in mind      that we're not going to be covering the making and use of      <em>survival</em> bows, which are a different breed. Those      weapons can be cobbled together quickly and easily from      whatever materials may come to hand, and they're suited      only to very close-range shooting. Rather, this discussion      will concern the crafting of precision weapons:      high-quality bows that take a while to produce, but that      will reward your patience and effort with years of reliable      accuracy.<br />      <br />      Some of the techniques may sound a bit difficult, but don't      let the fear of making an error keep you from trying your      hand at them. The raw materials needed are inexpensive or      free, and experience is a great teacher . . . so read on,      jump right in, and make a few beginner's mistakes, if need      be. Keep at it, and you'll become proficient in the      bowyer's ancient art. I'm certain you'll be glad you      did.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE BOWYER'S BARE ESSENTIALS</strong><br />      <br />      To craft bows of high quality, all you need is a small      workspace, a few common hand tools, four inexpensive      C-clamps, and a woodstove or other source of heat. Nature      will provide the rest of your tools and - if you keep      your weapon strictly primitive - <em>all</em> of your      materials.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        The Language of Archery      </h3>      <p>        <em>Like many specialized</em> <em>fields of human        interest, archery and bowmaking have their own jargon . .        . but by reviewing the terms below you'll soon be able to        "talk archery" with the best of them!</em>      </p>      <p>        <strong><em>Back:</em></strong> <em>The side of a bow        that faces forward, or away from the archer.</em>      </p>      <p>        <strong><em>Belly:</em></strong> <em>The inside of a bow        . . . the side facing the archer.</em>      </p>      <p>        <strong><em>Brace:</em></strong> <em>To string a        bow.</em>      </p>      <p>        <strong><em>Braced height:</em></strong> <em>The distance        between the string and handle of a braced, or strung,        bow.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Bowyer:</strong> The little old        bowmaker.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Draw:</strong> The distance, measured in        inches, that an archer pulls the bowstring. As a verb,        the act of pulling a bow back.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Ears:</strong> The forward-curving tips of a        recurved bow.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Fletching:</strong></em> <em>Feathers that        have been split in half and attached to the back portion        of an arrow to give it stability in flight.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Limbs:</strong></em> <em>The body of the bow        exclusive of the handle.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Longbow:</strong> A straight wooden bow        approximately six feet long, with no reflex or recurve,        popularized in England during the Middle Ages.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Nock:</strong> The notch in the back of an        arrow that receives the bowstring. Also, the notches on a        bow's tips that hold the bowstring in place. As a verb,        nock means placing an arrow on the string.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Recurved bow</strong> (or "recurve"): A bow        having the ends of its limbs bent forward.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Reflex:</strong> A bend at the midpoint, or        handle, of a bow that causes the limbs to bow slightly        forward when unstrung.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Self bow:</strong> A plain wooden bow, with        no reflex, recurve, or sinew backing. A longbow is a long        self bow.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Shaft:</strong> The body of an arrow, minus        fletching and point.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Stave:</strong> A piece of wood from which a        bow is made.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em><strong>Weight</strong> : The strength, measured in        pounds, required to pull a bow to full draw. (Full draw        is generally considered to be 28".)</em>      </p>    </div>    <p>      In some parts of the country, the traditional woods for      bowmaking are hickory, honey locust, mountain mahogany, and      juniper. The <em>best</em> bow woods are Osage orange (      <em>bois</em> <em>d'arc</em> ), yew, and ash. For the long      recurved bow and the longbow, I prefer white ash, which      makes a good beginner's wood for any style of bow because      of its "forgiving" qualities. Generally, though, Native      Americans used whatever materials were readily available,      and you can do the same. If none of the wood varieties I've      mentioned grow in your area, you can even order a      straight-grained plank of appropriate size through a      specialty hardwood dealer (but be certain that the wood      hasn't been kiln dried).<br />      <br />      If you want to harvest your own wood, look for a small tree      that's about 2" to 3" in diameter, free of knots and      blemishes, and straight. About 5-1/2 feet should be a good      length for any design except the longbow, which will need      about a foot more. You can also use a smaller sapling for a      bow stave: Search out one that's a little more than an inch      through the center and meets the aforementioned      requirements. The best time to cut such wood is in      February, when the sap is down. Remember that the wood is a      gift from the tree and the Creator and should be taken with      respect.<br />      <br />      I season my staves by storing them in the shed until      spring, then bring them indoors until the wood has aged for      a full year. The wood needs to be kept in a cool, dry place      during the seasoning process to prevent warping. If the      thought of having to wait a year before starting to work on      a bow stretches your patience, just buy an air-dried stave      from your hardwood dealer and get right down to      business.<br />      <br />      Once the wood has seasoned, it's time to remove the bark.      Instead of carving away the skin, <em>scrape</em> it off by      holding a sharp knife at a 90Â° angle to the wood . . .      so the blade won't slip and nick the stave. If you use a      sapling, carefully split the skinned pole down its full      length. If you're cautious, you can sometimes split two      usable bow staves from a single sapling, but I don't trust      my splitting all that much and would rather carve with a      drawknife until the desired thickness is reached. Bows made      from saplings will have a semicircular cross section.<br />      <br />      If you use a larger tree for a stave, split it carefully in      half, then - perhaps - in half again. (Some of      the instructors at my wilderness-skills school can get four      usable staves from a 3"-diameter tree!) Bows made from a      small tree will usually have a slightly curved, rectangular      cross section.<br />      <br />      After you've made your initial splits or have shaped the      stave with a drawknife, all subsequent scraping will have      to be done with scrapers, abraders (rasps or files), and      sanders . . . since too much whittling will "thin out" and      weaken the wood's grain.<br />      <br />      <strong>BENDING TO THE BOWMAKING TASK</strong><br />      <br />      With the stave aged, peeled, split, and rough shaped,      you're ready to get on with the <em>real</em> work of      making a bow. At this point, it's a good idea to "ask" the      wood what type of bow it wants to become rather than trying      to make it what you think it should be. In other words,      take into account the wood's quality, grain, and growth      patterns in deciding how to shape the tool that it will      become.<br />      <br />      Generally speaking, wide and thin is the best shape for      softwood bows. The extra width is necessary to help prevent      cracking. Softwoods tend to splinter more readily than do      the less brittle hardwoods, so hardwood bows can be made a      little thicker and not quite so wide.<br />      <br />      When I produce my bows, I never rely on tape measures or      calipers. I've learned to rely on what feels good for me      and for the wood. Thus, the dimensions given in this      article are by no means law . . . they're only averages to      help you in making your first bow. After you've shaped one      or two, you'll be able to use touch, sight, and your own      inner feelings to make a bow that's as personal as your      fingerprints.<br />      <br />      The initial steps in making a bow are the same, no matter      what design you've chosen for the finished product. First,      cut the stave to the length you want your bow to be when      completed (here, I'll be discussing one that's 5 feet      long). Now, find the longitudinal center point and measure      out about 3" in both directions (this 6" area will become      the grip, or handle). The next job is to taper and thin the      limbs. Starting from the outside of the grip area, and      using a rasp or coarse-toothed file, begin thinning and      tapering . . . from a thickness of about 5/8" at the      handle, down to 3/8" at the tips (you want to achieve a      smooth, <em>even</em> taper). The width should slope from      2-1/2" or so near the handle to about 1/2" at the tips. As      you work on this phase of the project, be sure to keep the      back and sides of the bow as flat (as opposed to      rounded-off) as possible . . . and also take care not to      <em>overdo</em> the thinning.<br />      <br />      Now, work on sculpting the handle to a size and shape that      pleases your grip. Thin the handle area in width and      thickness until it fits your hand comfortably, and then put      the finishing touches on the overall shaping of your bow      with a finer file, such as a mill file. And, while you have      that mill file in hand, go ahead and cut string notches in      the end of each limb . . . deep enough to hold the      bowstring in place but not deep enough to weaken the limb      tips.<br />      <br />      With that done, it's time to test the bow to see if the      limbs pull evenly. Tie a strong cord from tip to tip      - as if it were a bowstring - then place your      bare foot on the handle and pull upwards on the center of      the cord until the limbs begin to bend. Be careful not to      pull the ends up very far at this stage, since excessive      flexing might cause splitting if the limbs aren't even. If      you find that one limb pulls easier than the other,      carefully abrade away the belly of the stronger side, using      a mill file, until the limbs pull evenly. (The evening      process is known to bowyers as "tillering".) While      performing this test, you'll also get some idea of the draw      weight your bow will have when finished. Though you can      increase the stiffness of a too-flexible weapon by applying      sinew backing, being able to predict its draw weight <em>in      advance</em> requires long experience and liberal doses of      luck.<br />      <br />      <strong>FINISHING TOUCHES</strong><br />      <br />      Native American bowyers finished their weapons with      rendered bear or deer fat, applied warm. Deer brains were      sometimes used instead of, or together with, the fat. The      Indian bowmaker would then set or hang his handiwork near      the lodge fire to warm the fat and speed its absorption      into the wood. My personal preference is to mix rendered      deer fat <em>and</em> brains, apply the mixture warm, then      set the bow high above my woodstove so the rising warmth      can drive in the oils. (If you prefer to avoid working with      these natural products, almost any good wood finish can be      used, including varnish, linseed or cedar oil . . . and      even <em>lard</em> .)<br />      <br />      Once this chore is finished, the longbow is ready to shoot.      Go easy at first, giving your new hunting tool a chance to      break in. Sometimes, though, no matter <em>what</em> you do      in an effort to prevent it, a new bow will snap. This is      probably due to a flaw in the wood rather than something      you did wrong, but in either case there's nothing to do      except try again, using your newly gained experience to      ease and improve the next effort.<br />      <br />      We'll discuss the details of sinew backing a little later      on, but it should be briefly mentioned at this point that      sinew will keep a new bow from breaking, improve its snap      and cast, and add pulling pounds to the limbs. I therefore      suggest that <em>all</em> your bows be sinew-backed, even      though the technique was not traditionally used on      longbows.<br />      <br />      <strong>PUTTING THE CURVE IN A RECURVED BOW</strong><br />      <br />      To enhance your hunting weapon's speed, power, and beauty,      you may want to add recurve to the limbs. For a recurved      bow, follow the instructions for the self bow and longbow      but stop short of applying the brains and fat.What you're      going to do now is to bend the last 6" or so of the limbs      <em>forward</em> .    </p>        <p>      <strong>ARROWMAKING: STRAIGHT AND FAST</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>To complete your primitive-archery outfit, you'll want      a supply of arrows to go with your custom-made bow . . .      projectiles that are every bit as functional and beautiful      as their launcher. Cherry, serviceberry (Juneberry), ash,      dogwood, cedar, bush blueberry, and even cane and reed are      good woods to use for arrow shafts. Cut sections about      three feet long from saplings with base diameters of 1/2"      or so, and take the time to search out knot free shafts.      Collect your arrow wood during the winter, when the sap is      down. After bundling the shafts together into tight      packages tied every few inches with cord, let them season      as you did your bow stave.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>When the shafts have aged for a full year, remove the      bark, again by scraping instead of carving (because they      are so much thinner than bow staves, even greater care is      necessary when shaping arrow shafts). If you're shooting a      five-foot-long bow, measure your arrows from the tip of      your extended middle finger to the pit of your arm . . .      about 30" for an average adult male. For a shorter bow,      your arrows will be only about 23" to 25" long. (The      extremely short bows used by Plains Indians were designed      for easy shooting from horseback and were rarely pulled to      full draw. If you want to be able to shoot a long arrow at      full draw, you'll need a bow that's at</em> least <em>48"      long, preferably longer. Otherwise -</em> <em>even if      the bow is well made and doesn't break your - fingers      will suffer string pinch due to the acute angle formed when      a short bow is overdrawn.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Using coarse grained sandpaper, smooth the arrow shafts      down to a diameter of about 5/16". Then switch to a      fine-grit paper or emery cloth for finishing. Once the      shafts are smooth, rub them with rendered fat and warm them      near the fire to induce absorption of the oils. (Of course,      you could also simply buy 5/16" hardwood dowels.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Crooked arrows can be straightened by heating them,      bending the kinks out with your fingers or your teeth, and      holding the shafts straight until they cool. Sometimes it's      necessary to use an arrow straightener, or wrench, to      unbend stubborn spots on an arrow. To make this tool, drill      a shaft-sized hole through a piece of antler or bone. Then      stick a heated shaft through the hole and use the wrench as      a lever to bend out the kinks.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Next comes the fletching. 1 find that a 6"long      fletching, trimmed to a height of about 1/2", provides good      aerodynamics and closely resembles the traditional Indian      style. Turkey tail feathers are the best, but the tail      plumage of almost any large or medium-sized bird will do in      a pinch. (Just be sure not to use feathers from any of the      many protected species of birds or you'll be letting      yourself in for a federal-type felony!)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You'll need three fletches for each arrow. Start by      cutting longitudinally along the median line of each      feather's quill, splitting the feather into two equal      halves. After carving away the pith and excess quill, trim      the feathers to the proper height, and check to see that      they're all of a uniform size and shape.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To fasten the fletches to the arrow's shaft, hold the      backs of the feathers in place at the nock end of the      shaft, and bind the fronts of the feathers to the arrow      with a wrapping of moist sinew. (Some bowyers temporarily      anchor the fletches to the shaft with pine pitch or diluted      hide glue, thereby freeing both hands for the wrapping      chores.) Apply the sinew by first separating it into      threads, just as you did for the bow backing, then wetting      it with saliva and wrapping it on evenly. The      saliva-and-sinew mixture forms its own glue and doesn't      have to be tied. After the front wrappings have dried,      repeat the process at the back of the fletchings, wrapping      up to the base of the nock. The dried sinew is almost      transparent, lies close to the shaft, and tightens up even      more as it ages.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To cut the bowstring notches in the backs of the      arrows, abrade a U-shaped slot with a small rat-tail file      (or saw carefully with a hacksaw) down to just above the      top sinew wrap behind the fletching. The nock will then be      supported by the sinew wrap, preventing the shock from the      bowstring from splitting the shaft. Be sure to position      your string notches so that when the arrow is shot, two      feathers will pass across the bow evenly, with the third      - or "cock" - fletching protruding at a 90Â°      angle away from the bow.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The size of the arrowheads and the notches that will      hold the heads onto the fronts of the shafts will be      determined by the animals you plan to hunt, your personal      preference, and your state's laws. In my state, as in most,      it's illegal to hunt big game with anything other than a      wide steel broadhead. Steel heads can be cut from any      source of thin sheet steel, using a jigsaw or tin snips,      then filed and honed razor-sharp. (The Plains Indians      actually got much of their arrowhead metal from the iron      rims of wagon wheels.) Take care to make the proper base      shape - or notch - on the backs of the heads so      they'll fit snugly into the arrow-shaft notches and provide      a good anchor for sinew wrapping.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Bone arrowheads can be almost as sharp and deadly as      steel broadheads. Just use the cannon bone from the lower      leg of a deer; split the bone in half, file to shape, and      sharpen.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Then too, stone points can bye chipped from flint,      chert, jasper, quartz, obsidian, and even glass.      Flint-knapping is a complex topic and would require an      article of its own for even a cursory treatment, but tests      have shown that well-made stone heads can achieve even      greater penetration than steel.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>OK . . . you've formed your arrowheads - steel,      stone, or bone - and cut the slots they'll fit into      on the arrow shafts. Now it's time to bind the points to      the shafts: Just slip the heads down into their notches and      apply a good wrapping of spittle-moistened sinew, as you      did with the fletchings.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Once the heads have dried in place, your arrows are      ready to shoot.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>For hunting, it's best to leave the shafts more or less      natural or to crest them with subdued colors. But for      target practice, you might apply decorative stripes to your      arrows . . . an artistic touch that will also help you      follow those erratic shots that will inevitably send an      arrow slithering beneath a cover of grass and leaves.</em>    </p>        <p>      Set a large pot of water (a big coffeepot is perfect) on      the stove to boil. When it's bubbling, dip one end of the      bow into the water, up to about 9", and let it "cook" for      3-1/2 to 4 hours. While the bow-end is in its hot bath, cut      out a recurve form - as shown in an accompanying      photo - from a piece of scrap 2 X 4 lumber (you'll      need one for each limb). The exact curve of the form is up      to you, as long as it is not beyond the bending      capabilities of your stave.    </p>        <p>      When the first bow-end has finished boiling, place it over      the convex side of the form and secure it with two      C-clamps. The best approach here is to fasten the      <em>tip</em> of the limb in place first, then - using      the bow as a lever - slowly bend the limb back over      the form and clamp it down securely. (To keep the limbs      from getting dented, use small blocks of soft wood between      the clamps and the bow.) At this point - with the      first end of the bow locked over the bending form -      start cooking the other tip . . . then repeat the clamping      process. Now, give the bow a full day of rest in a warm,      dry place.<br />      <br />      The next step is to remove the clamps and fine-tune your      newly recurved bow. Tuning is accomplished by removing a      little of the belly wood at the point just <em>before</em>      the recurve begins. I usually take off 1/16" to 1/8" of      belly wood, starting at the base of the recurve and working      back about 6" toward the handle. I find that after I've      done this fine-tuning, the bow has a faster action and      reduced kick, or jolt. (Some bowyers say that this final      shaving keeps the recurve's "ears" from snapping off, too.)      Once your bow is tuned, you can either sinew-back it or      finish it up as you would a longbow.<br />      <br />      And if you want to give your hunting tool even more zip and      zing, you can add a reflex to the bow by bending the back      slightly forward. Just heat the handle area over a steaming      kettle of water for a couple of hours, then lay the bow      - its back facing down - over a small log, and      stand barefooted on the limbs until the wood has cooled (it      doesn't take all that long). This will produce a forward      curve, or reflex, adding even more punch to the weapon.      (Reflexing is <em>especially</em> important for extremely      short bows similar to the stubby "horse bows" that the      Plains Indians used so effectively against the tough-hided      buffalo.)<br />      <br />      <strong>SINEW-BACKING BASICS</strong><br />      <br />      The two ingredients necessary to sinew-back a bow are sinew      from the leg and back tendons of animals, and hide glue      (made from hide shavings and hooves).<br />      <br />      I prefer to use the leg sinew of deer and elk . . . though      horse, buffalo, cow, goat, and moose sinew work just as      well. If you're not a hunter - and don't know one      - arrange to buy tendons from the local      slaughterhouse. Usually, the people there will just give      them to you (and probably decide that you're a bit      strange).<br />      <br />      After cutting the tendons from the legs and back of an      animal, prepare the sinew by removing the clear sheath that      holds the tendons together. Then place the exposed bundles      well above a heat source to dry. When they're no longer      moist, pound the tendons on a board, using a wooden mallet      or a smooth rock as a hammer to separate the bundles of      tissue into individual threads.<br />      <br />      To prepare hide glue, put hooves, hide scrapings, and      dewclaws into a pot with just enough water to cover them,      and boil the "stew" for several hours. (To get a finer      consistency, you may want to skim off the scum that bubbles      up to the top of the boiling pot.) You'll end up with a      thick, glompy mass of glue that's perfect for the job of      welding sinew strips to wood. (An alternative to      homebrewing is commercial hide glue, available at many      hobby shops in both liquid and powder form. But the      store-bought stuff lacks the authen ticity -      <em>and</em> rousing aroma - of the homemade      material. You can forget about epoxy and other chemical      binders: They definitely won't work.)<br />      <br />      When you get ready to use the glue, keep the container      warmed in a water bath atop the stove (120Â°F or      thereabouts is perfect), since at room temperature the      adhesive gets gummy and sets up too fast, especially if      your workroom is cool to begin with.<br />      <br />      Prepare your bow to receive the glue and sinew by roughing      up the back with a hard, abrasive rock. Make sure the wood      is cleaned of any greasy fingermarks or dirt, then paint      the bow's back with hide glue that's been thinned in a      ratio of about two parts glue to one part warm (preferably      distilled) water. Next, wet the sinew strips and place them      - a few strands at a time - into the hide glue      to soak for a few minutes.<br />      <br />      Squeegee off excess glue as you remove each piece of sinew      from the glue pot, and - starting at the longitudinal      center of the bow and working out toward the tips (or the      other way around, if you prefer) - apply strips of      glue-soaked sinew, laying them parallel to the limbs and as      straight as possible. Cover the entire back of the bow with      the sinew, and try to make a smooth job of it, staggering      the ends of the strands to avoid making seams. Apply sinew      all the way to the tips of the limbs, then fold about 2"      over to the belly side to strengthen the tips. Once the      back is sinew-covered, let it dry awhile . . . then apply      two or three more coats of sinew and glue. When you're      finished, let the bow rest for at least a couple of      weeks.<br />      <br />      After the sinew has cured, shoot your weapon a few times at      half draw to see if it needs any more fine-tuning. If you      find that you need to even up the pull of the limbs again,      simply tiller the sinew just as you did with the belly wood      earlier. (Sinew works well under a mill file.) Finally,      finish your bow with a mush of rendered fat and deer      brains, as described for the longbow. This time, however,      <em>don't</em> place the bow near heat.<br />      <br />      As time goes by, you'll find that the sinew continues to      pull against the bow's belly, producing a forward curving,      or reflex . . . but don't be alarmed, since more reflex      will only strengthen the weapon. After a year or two, the      sinew will have pulled all it's going to, and your bow will      have assumed its permanent shape and shooting      characteristics . . . and will last a <em>lot</em> of years      if properly cared for.    </p>        <p>      <strong>STRING THAT BOW<br /></strong><br />      Reverse-wrapped sinew is the traditional fair-weather      bowstring. And for wet-weather shooting, the fibers of      plants such as velvetleaf, hemp, dogbane, and nettle work      admirably. By reverse-wrapping a string to more than twice      the length of the bow, then folding the cordage in half and      reverse-wrapping it again, you'll produce a strong and      durable bowstring with a loop at one end. The other tip end      can simply be tied to the bottom limb. (For a      photo-illustrated guide to reverse-wrapping, see my article      "Making Natural Cordage" in MOTHER NO. 79, page 38.) And,      of course, those of you who are in a hurry can just trot      down to the local sporting goods dealer and purchase a      ready-made bowstring of the appropriate length.<br />      <br />      To determine the correct bracing height for your bow (and      - in turn - the correct length for your      string), place one fist on the inside of the grip and      extend your thumb as if you were trying to flag a ride . .      . the attached string should just touch the tip of your      outstretched digit.<br />      <br />      <strong>PARTING SHOTS</strong><br />      <br />      Before Europeans entered the picture with their advanced      technology and metal tools, Native American bowyers      painstakingly fashioned finely crafted bows with stone and      bone implements. The process took a lot longer, but Stone      Age humans weren't as frantic about the passage of an hour      as today's ulcer-ridden people tend to be. And those      earlier products were often every bit as beautiful and      serviceable as fine machine-laminated bows.<br />      <br />      Archery has had a long history not only in the Americas but      in virtually every corner of the globe except Australia.      The ancient Turkish horn-and-sinew composite bows -      to cite one shining example - were quite probably the      most effective primitive weapons the world has ever known.      Bows are silent, pinpoint-accurate in practiced hands,      designed to test the hunter to the extremes of his or her      skill . . . and they offer the game animal a sporting      chance. <em>[EDITORS NOTE: As you know, there's a great      responsibility placed upon the hunter who uses primitive      weapons . . . to develop his or her accuracy to the maximum      and to avoid taking any shots that might result in losing a      wounded animal.]</em><br />      <br />      In addition to saving the hundreds of dollars that it would      cost to equip yourself with a top-quality modern compound      bow and fiberglass or aluminum arrows, hunting with a piece      of wood that's taken on a beautiful shape under your own      hands can help you achieve harmony with nature and the      past, a harmony which has all but disappeared from our      overmechanized, depersonalized world.<br />      <br />      AUTHOR'S NOTE: <em>Native American Archery</em> by Reginald      and Gladys Laubin is the ultimate authority on this subject      and can be ordered from The University of Oklahoma Press,      1005 Asp St., Norman, OK 73019.

In the right hands, a larger sapling or limb can be split into four staves. All subse quent shaping must be done with abraders; whittling can weaken the wood and may cause nicks. [2] Use a rasp to work the handle down to a size and shape that feel comfortable in your hand. Thin and taper the limbs gradually toward the bow tips. There is no one best size or shape for a traditional American Indian bow, but strength and aesthetics should be taken into account. [3]With the basic shaping of the bow completed, it's time to check the evenness of limb-pull. Tie a stout cord from end to end of the bow, place your bare foot on the handle, and pull up gently. If one limb is stronger than the other, carefully abrade away belly wood until the limbs pull evenly. [4] To put the curve in a recurved bow . . . boil the bow tip for four hours, then place it over the convex side of a 2 X 4 form. Lock the tip in place with a C clamp, then bend the limb around the form and lock it down with a second clamp. Allow at least 24 hours before removing the clamps.

After the tendon bundles are dried and pounded, they will separate into in dividual strands. [2] To apply sinew, first rough up the back of the bow to provide a good gripping surface for the glue. Wet the sinew strands, soak them in hide glue, then apply them in parallel rows until the entire back of the bow is covered. Allow the glue to dry, and then apply two more layers.
