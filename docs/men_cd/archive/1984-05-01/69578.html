                <p>      Any grower worth his or her sod knows that the new year      really begins on the first day he or she starts breaking      ground for spring<br /> planting. And we'd like to mark this      agricultural beginning by telling you what's happening in      MOTHER's own garden!    </p>            <p>      For the firs. t spring in the last five, Kerry and Barbara      Sullivan won't be tending the crops and flowers out at our      Ecological Research Center. Yes, that dedicated couple has      moved on to study biodynamics (the agricultural method we      examined in detail on pages 82-85 of our last issue) at      Emerson College in England. But our plants shall hardly      perish, because two fine horticulturists will be serving in      the Sullivans' stead. Newcomers Franklin Sides and Walker      Abel will be caretaking our many organically grown flowers,      herbs, vegetables, fruits, and field crops.<br />      <br />      And speaking of change, Sides and Abel are working on a new      - well, actually, a distinctly <em>old</em> -      method of breaking ground this spring . . . namely, horse      plowing. The five-year-old, 1,100-pound      part-Morgan/part-Belgian draft mare in the accompanying      photo is Molly, our new horse. And that's our chief plowman      Franklin on her right. Now Molly is a particularly      well-trained work animal. Mr. Sides, however, still has a      thing or two to learn. As he readily admits, "Molly is      breaking <em>me</em> in. I'm apprenticing to <em>her</em>      ."<br />      <br />      How does he like it? "That crazy horse is the most exciting      thing happening to me right now," Franklin says joyfully.      "I tell you, it's a lot different from riding a tractor.      You can <em>hear</em> the earth breaking as you plow and      <em>see</em> life in the soil - worms and their      tunnels, for instance - as you go.<br />      <br />      "Of course, you also have to be able to      <em>communicate</em> with a horse . . . you can't just turn      the steering wheel, you know. But Molly does a fine job,      and she's quite economical for a small setup like ours.      We're even planning to breed her to a purebred Belgian this      year so we can 'reproduce our own tractor'!"<br />      <br />      Franklin does allow that the task of learning horse plowing      isn't all roses: "Spending a day behind Molly wears me      <em>all</em> the way out, mostly because I'm still learning      how to do it. She could probably plow an acre of sod in a      day, but - right now - I'll be clanged if I      could!"<br />      <br />      <strong>THE MINIGARDEN COMPARISON</strong><br />      <br />      Another exciting project our new gardeners have undertaken      involves growing four side-by-side experimental      minigardens. Each naturally fertilized plot will contain      the nine vegetables most raised by home gardeners:      tomatoes, peppers, green beans, cucumbers, onions, lettuce,      summer squash, carrots, and radishes. In fact, each will      carry the same <em>number</em> of plants of each type. But      the areas will display four different organic methods:      biodynamic/French intensive (with fully double-dug beds) .      . . rototilled biodynamic/French intensive (in which the      raised beds are created by tilling the entire plot and then      raking the loose pathway soil up onto the growing beds) . .      . conventional "till it and plant it in rows" gardening . .      . and deep mulching (Ã  la Ruth Stout) in a      conventional row garden. Since the last two methods require      more space than the first two, the four plots won't all be      of the same <em>size</em> . Our growers designed 18' X 42'      areas for the deepmulch and conventional test gardens,      while they should be able to squeeze the same number of      plants into 4' X 42' plots in the two biointensive      beds!<br />      <br />      Walker and Franklin will keep detailed records of yields      and work hours on the four minigardens. And while the      results - specific to one summer in one locale with      one set of growers - won't constitute a valid      scientific test, they should provide some suggestive      comparisons. Did you ever wonder if a double-dug garden      really demands a lot more time overall than a plain      rototilled one? Or if you can get the same yields -      in the same amount of space - from a rototilled      biointensive plot as from a hand-dug one? Or if deep      mulching is suitable for moist climates?<br />      <br />      <em>We've wondered</em> . . . and we'll let you know what      we find out!<br />      <br />      <strong>THAT'S NOT ALL</strong><br />      <br />      Preparing fields and minding minigardens are hardly the      only things our new growers will be up to this year.      Franklin and Walker also have a brand-new gardening talk      planned for Eco-Village visitors that focuses on detailed      aspects of growing and using specific vegetables, flowers,      and herbs. They'll be coordinating an expanded apprentice      program, training nine volunteer gardeners in homescale      horticulture. And - let's not <em>forget</em> -      the pair will get to tackle the considerable task of      managing over <em>one hundred</em> 4' X 30' double-dug beds      in our main vegetable and flower garden!<br />      <br />      Yes sir, you can bet MOM's gardeners will have their hands      (and plots) full! So before they get too bound to the soil,      let's spend a relaxed moment getting to know a bit more      about Franklin Sides and Walker Abel.<br />      <br />      The lean and wiry Franklin earned a degree in field-crop      technology at what he calls "a state cow college" and was      teaching gardening at a nearby camp when he met and got to      know the Sullivans. He has welcomed the opportunity to work      in MOTHER's gardens. As Sides puts it, "I feel we all      should have some kind of connection with the process of      producing our own food. By working here, I feel I can help      in a small way to make that connection more widespread . .      . by helping others learn how to grow healthful, organic      food." Incidentally, raising "baby tractors" is not the      only type of reproduction that interests this gardener: His      wife Wendy is expecting a baby in July!<br />      <br />      Franklin does <em>not</em> fit the image of the serene      gardener/philosopher. By his own admission, he tends to be      a bit excitable, worried about production. Walker, though,      has a calm, quiet nature that provides a counterpoint to      his high-energy cohort. The patriarch of a horticultural      family (his wife Olivia works in the garden and tends the      bees, while his three-year-old son Stuart wishes he were      old enough to run lawn mowers), Walker developed many of      his gardening skills as an apprentice in the Santa Cruz      University gardening program that was founded by famed      horticulturist Alan Chadwick. "My interest in this work      started of because I saw gardening as a way to really care      for the planet . . . to say that <em>in this one place</em>      we're going to do whatever we can to make the earth healthy      and to further life, <em>all</em> life. As I worked more      and more with plants, though, I started to find a joy in      gardening. You know that old proverb 'If you want to be      happy for one day, get drunk. If you want to be happy for      three days, get married. If you want to be happy for a      lifetime, be a gardener.' That's certainly proving true for      me."<br />      <br />      Sides's and Abel's contrasting interests ("I'm      horticulture, he's agriculture," Walker quips) and      personalities make them quite a complementary and      well-qualified pair. So we're absolutely positive that this      year they'll raise the best Eco-Village gardens ever. But      then, it <em>is</em> spring, that season when      <em>every</em> garden is going to be perfect, before      insects devour leaves, before storms ruin crops, before      weeds swallow all.    </p>
