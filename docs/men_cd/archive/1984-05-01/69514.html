                <p>      <em>"When the brutal truth sank in and I realized that we'd      come all that way only to be told to get off our own land .      . . I gave to violent<br /> tears and Lee held me in shaking      arms."</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Linda Hansen    </h5>    <p>      We stood there dazed and bewildered, slowly realizing that      our dream had died . . . or rather, had been killed by a      stranger's hand. <em>Adverse possession!</em> We'd never      heard the term before. But it meant that someone could call      the sheriff and have the deputy who stood before us now      order us <em>off</em> our own bought-and-paid-for      property.<br />      <br />      <strong>HINDSIGHT</strong><br />      <br />      Looking back, I'm still amazed at how much trouble could      start with just a little ad offering land for sale. When I      saw it-in an issue of MOTHER-I was excited,      because my husband Lee and I had spent the past decade      working to earn the money and learn the skills necessary to      fulfill our dream: living a self-sufficient life on a      homestead "somewhere in Oregon". That's where my      grandparents had settled and farmed . . . where my mother      was raised . . . and where my brothers and sisters and I      had spent many idyllic childhood vacations.<br />      <br />      So we called the realty company listed in the ad and      learned that there were parcels of 40, 60, and 120 acres      available, scattered all over southeastern Oregon. The      prices were within our range, and the terms sounded good .      . . so we requested property maps and descriptions, and      waited for them eagerly.<br />      <br />      A week later, a big, brown envelope ar rived at our home in      the Bay Area of California . . . and we all but shredded      the container in our haste to get at its contents. My      husband grabbed the descriptions while I snatched the maps      from under the quick fingers of my two daughters, Lorelei      and Edena, and we sat down to study what we <em>hoped</em>      would lead us to our future homeplace.<br />      <br />      At first, we were disappointed. Most of the offerings      seemed to be flat land filled with sagebrush . . . not the      kind of country we'd dreamed of. However, we did come      across one package that looked promising: 60 acres near      Burns, Oregon. Much of the property overlooked a valley      from a high, southwest-facing cliff ... but the real      clincher was the fact that the parcel also contained 15      acres of rich bottomland beneath that promontory. And      better still, a year-round creek-headed by a small      dam and a three-mile-long reservoir, just a mile      away-flowed through a corner of that section. So we      knew the site would provide us with plenty of water for our      livestock.<br />      <br />      In short, we figured we'd found our dream spot . . and when      we traveled to Oregon a month later to inspect the      property, our hopes were confirmed. We loved the place, and      bought it!<br />      <br />      THE BIG MOVE<br />      <br />      The following year, we returned to our "estate" to survey      the property. The adjoining land was (and still is) owned      by a widow and her son, and we met him one day while out      measuring our acreage. He seemed surprised that we were      there, but when we explained that we owned the      land-and showed him the papers to prove it-he      wished us luck, and drove away.<br />      <br />      Later that week-just before we left-we visited      our neighbor and gave him our address, saying that we'd      appreciate his getting in touch if any problems cropped up.      He promised he would, and we headed back to California to      pack up our belongings.<br />      <br />      It took us a month of hard work to get all our gear      together, but we finally managed to pack the whole mess      into our old '64 van. We loaded our livestock-goats,      two gilt pigs, and a small horse-into the bed box      that we'd installed in our new Dodge pickup, and (after      getting the necessary vet inspections and permits required      for transporting animals across the state line) we directed      our convoy toward Oregon and a new life.<br />      <br />      We arrived 36 road-hours later (we'd planned on just 12) .      . . weary, bleary-eyed, and minus the van, which we'd      left-blown engine and all-at a gas station just      west of the Sierras. Exhausted as we were, I couldn't help      but laugh when my daughters and I unloaded the animals to      take them to the creek for a drink: Our herd virtually      exploded from the bed, pigs squealing, goats running to      stretch their legs, and the horse backing away and almost      sitting down in disbelief at the surrounding chaos.      Lorelei, Edena, and I ended up in the creek in a mad rush      of thirsty animals . . . and for a few wonderful, happy      moments-while our pigs buried themselves up to their      eyeballs in soft mud-we splashed playfully, awash in      newfound freedom.<br />      <br />      Then something made me look over toward the truck, and I      saw Lee gesturing for me to come. Then he pointed down the      road. As I started walking toward him, feeling      instinctively uneasy (I couldn't quite make out what he was      saying), I spotted the object of his concern: a sheriff's      Jeep bearing down upon us in a cloud of dust.<br />      <br />      <strong>DISASTER</strong><br />      <br />      I ran quickly to Lee's side, and-with puzzled      looks-we met the young deputy. He asked our names      and, when we replied, handed us a sheaf of official-looking      papers. He told us that we were trespassing and would have      to remove ourselves from the premises!<br />      <br />      Shocked (to say the least), we asked the officer for an      explanation. He pointed to the papers and-looking a      bit uncomfortable-said they were a summons to a      hearing to establish a claim of adverse possession by the      widow and her son on our 15 acres of bottomland. And he      added that, in Oregon, any disputed real estate is      considered the property of the claimant <em>until</em> the      matter is settled.<br />      <br />      When the brutal truth sank in and I realized that we'd come      all that way only to be told to get off our own land 20      minutes after we'd arrived, I gave way to violent tears and      Lee held me in shaking arms. We cried together in shock and      grief, and-as we wept-the deputy quietly      left.<br />      <br />      "The witch!" I shouted in rage and frustration. "If there      was a problem, why didn't she call us or mail the papers?      Why did she wait until we'd committed everything we had to      the move here?"<br />      <br />      Believe it or not, we <em>still</em> don't know the answer      to that question.<br />      <br />      <strong>RETREAT</strong><br />      <br />      Suddenly, we found ourselves in a terrible situation. We'd      originally planned for Lee to return to the Bay Area to      work (a friend was due to pick him up that night) while the      girls and I would set up a camp on our land and look for a      home to rent temporarily in nearby Burns. But now, of      course, all that had changed. And worse yet, we didn't even      have enough money to finance a trip back to the Bay Area .      . . Lee would have to return as planned and work for at      least two weeks to get the necessary cash. In the meantime,      my daughters and I would be forced to camp up on our high      ground (at least that much of our property wasn't under      dispute).<br />      <br />      Since there wasn't any water on the higher part of the      acreage, I'd have to haul enough from the reservoir for      ourselves and our animals. Even that, though, wouldn't be      enough for our filly . . . I knew she'd suffer terribly      without constant water and good grass. So with tears      rolling down my face, I unhobbled her and turned her loose.      I left her there on the disputed piece of      bottomland-along with our strength, hopes, dreams,      and pride-and drove away without looking back.<br />      <br />      Lorelei, Edena, and I will never forget the two long weeks      we spent on that windswept cliff waiting for our going-home      money to arrive. What I remember most-besides the      heat, the trips to the lake for water, and the haunting      beauty of the place-is sitting there on the cliff,      watching the widow's son and his men hay the land below us      ( <em>our</em> land). Lee's earnings eventually came in the      mail, and we headed back to California, stopping only      once-just across the state line-to sell our      remaining livestock.<br />      <br />      <strong>AN UPDATE</strong><br />      <br />      Two years have passed since I drove away from our dreams.      We finally won our fight for the land (the widow and her      son never did have a strong claim), but it took a whole      year in court to do so. By the time the case was closed, we      decided to sell the acreage back to the realty company for      what we had in it . . . and they, in turn, sold it to the      widow.<br />      <br />      We learned from our experience, though . . . and used our      knowledge-along with the money we'd invested in the      Burns property-to buy a fine, timbered 80-acre parcel      ( <em>free</em> of any adverse possession claims!) near      Klamath Falls, Oregon. We haven't moved there yet, but we      will soon . . . and that is where we'll make our final      stand for the free life.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For an explanation of what the term</em>      <em>adverse possession means-and of how you can best      avoid such a challenge to your property      ownership-please read the accompanying sidebar.</em>    </p>    <p>      Part of this sidebar is reprinted with permission of      Macmillan Publishing Company from <em>Finding and Buying      Your Place in the Country</em> by Les Scher. Copyright      © 1974 by Les Scher.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Adverse Possession: Squatters' Rights</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you own or are about to buy land, keep Linda Hansen's      experiences-as related above-in mind. Under      certain conditions the title to all or a portion of your      land can be challenged and lost if some other party simply      uses the property-before <em>or</em> after you      purchase it-for a specific length of time established      by state law. This is called <em>adverse possession . .      .</em> commonly referred to by lay people as <em>squatters'      rights.</em>    </p>    <p>      The concept was originally devised in medieval England to      encourage the cultivation of land (and to help fill the      kingdom's coffers, since more taxes could be collected on      property that was occupied or otherwise developed). The      intent of the law, therefore-to assure that      landowners make reasonably productive use of their      property-was (and, debatably, still is) more or less      sensible. But it may also present pitfalls to the unwary.    </p>    <p>      In fact, in some cases you can be subject to a claim of      adverse possession even though you've had a title search      conducted <em>and</em> have purchased title insurance . . .      a fact that makes it all the more important to understand      the circumstances under which such a situation can evolve.    </p>    <p>      Here's what Les Scher has to say about the subject in his      excellent book, <em>Finding and Buying Your Place in the      Country</em> (Macmillan, <em>1974, $11.95):</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>For a person to take your title away from you, his use      of your land must be [1] hostile, [2] actual, [3]      notorious, [4] exclusive, [5] continuous, and [6] under a      claim of title for [7] a specified period of time. Each of      these elements must be met by the person, or "squatter, "      who seeks to adversely possess your land.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[1] The possessor must use your land without your      permission and must deny the fact that you are the true      owner. Thus, if you give the person permission to, or      specific orders not to, use the land, he can never gain      'title by adverse possession. His use must be "hostile" to      you.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[2] The person must be making "actual" use of your      land. He must be living or working on the land in some      fashion. Some activities that have led to adverse      possession of portions of land in the past include clearing      brush, cutting trees, planting crops, putting in ditches,      erecting a building, fencing off a section of the land, and      living on the land.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[3] The user must be "notorious" in the manner in which      he is on the land. He cannot sneak around the owner's      property in such a manner that he could not be discovered      and his activities must be visible to the owner if he were      to examine his land.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[4]"Exclusive" possession means that the user must be      on the land alone. If he is there with the owner or against      the owner's specific orders, he cannot get title to the      land.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[5] Use of the land must be "continuous" from the      beginning of the prescribed time period to the end,      although seasonal use for the prescribed number of years is      generally permissible.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[6] The possessor must claim that he owns the land,      even if he is wrong. His actions will speak for themselves      in this regard. If he is acting as if he believes he owns      the land, he is taking the property under a "claim of      title. " If he ever admits that he knows he does not      actually own the land, he cannot claim adverse      possession.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[7] The time limit for acquiring adverse possession is      called the "statute of limitations." All of the above      elements must occur for a minimum length of time before      adverse possession "ripens" into title. The minimum period      varies among the states, from five years in California to      twenty-one years in Pennsylvania. It runs from the time the      possessor begins to use the property and continues running      even if the property is sold by the actual owner.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>ACQUIRING THE LAND<br /></strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The most common instance of acquiring land by adverse      possession occurs when a neighbor unknowingly puts up a      fence that encloses a portion of an adjoining landowner's      property. If he meets all the above requirements and has      his fence up for the prescribed period of time, when he      discovers that he has fenced in the neighboring land he can      go to court and get a court order, or declaratory judgment,      stating that he now owns the land he has enclosed. Another      common situation that leads to adverse possession is when a      part of a building, a section of an orchard, or other      improvement encroaches on a neighbor's land and this      "mistake" is not discovered before the prescribed time      period has elapsed.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The willingness of the courts to award title by adverse      possession varies among the states. For example, some      states require that the possessor have a document, such as      a faulty deed, that appears to give good title but actually      does not. Other states require that taxes be paid for the      prescribed period by the user in order for him to gain      legal possession.</em>    </p>    <p>      It's important to remember <em>,</em> too, that since a      standard title search ordinarily reviews only matters of      public record-such as deed transfers-it's not      likely to reveal whether someone has been, or <em>is,</em>      using the land as an adverse possessor.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, title insurance policies-which can      differ considerably from company to company-vary in      regard to the protection they provide against claims of      adverse possession. Some <em>specifically</em> except      claims that are not a matter of public record but that      could be ascertained by inspecting the land and/or making      personal inquiries. Others exclude only claims of adverse      possession that are known by the buyer at the time of      purchase . . . while still others (which usually require a      legal survey) provide more or less full protection.    </p>    <p>      It's generally agreed that getting a legal survey of the      property you're considering is one of the best ways to      avoid a claim of adverse possession. And title insurance is      also strongly recommended . . . but do be sure to read the      sections in the policy that list exceptions to coverage,      and make sure you understand their implications fully. In      addition, most attorneys advise that you get a warranty      deed for <em>any</em> piece of real estate: Such a deed      guarantees that (among other things) the <em>seller</em>      will defend any claim against the title by another party.    </p>    <p>      And finally, you might also want to remember that even      though the claim of adverse possession made against the      Hansen family didn't hold up in court, it nonetheless      created substantial problems for them . . . and resulted in      their eventually selling the land.    </p>    <p>      If you're considering buying property, a wise first step      would be to inspect the parcel yourself for signs of use by      others. It's also a good idea to pay a visit to your      prospective neighbors to get a feeling for where      <em>they</em> consider the property lines to be. Any      indication that anyone has been using (or might simply be      inclined to contest your right to buy) the land in question      just might be sufficient reason to think about shopping for      real estate someplace else.    </p>
