                    <hr />    <p>      If you now operate-or have ever operated-a successful home      business that was inspired by an article you read In      MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or less) when and where-and      with how much "seed money"you started your venture. Because      if your story can be fitted into an upcoming installment of      BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES, you'll receive [1] the warm      satisfaction of knowing that you helped someone else find      the happiness you enjoy and [2] a free two-year new or      renewal subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>    <p>      After moving to the country and watching our life savings      melt away as we waited for a job that never materialized      (my husband is a computer programmer), we turned to      MOTHER's back issues for something that would provide us      with an income.    </p>    <p>      "How to Set Up and Run a Firewood Business" (pages 6465) in      Issue No. 41 was just the thing. West Virginia had just      survived one of its worst winters, fuel prices were at      their highest, and we had a lot of trees on our 100 acres .      . . so why not sell firewood?    </p>    <p>      We already had all the necessary equipment-except for the      powered log splitter-that Glen Smith had mentioned in his      article. And since we had no extra money to invest in a      business, we were quite willing to split the logs by hand      with a sledge, wedge, and axe.    </p>    <p>      A few months before we started selling firewood we had      bought a used dump truck for $500 to do light hauling in      the area. So-naturally enough-we started using the truck      for delivering a cord or more of wood . . . saving time and      gas. After a little time (and a little advertising) we had      our sales established and our problem behind us, at least      for the winter!    </p>    <p>      We sell our wood for $50 a cord (delivered) . . . and in a      good week can gross $200. After meeting all expenses-gas      for the saw and truck, and advertising-we still net $190.    </p>    <p>      It'll take us quite a while to cover the cost of the dump      truck in its "regular" work (we only net $10 a load hauling      coal, rock, etc.), butthanks to MOTHER-we found the courage      and inspiration to try and make it in the country without a      job in the city.    </p>    <p>      Lorraine MacNeil Jane Law, W. Va.    </p>    <p>      When I opened my copy of MOTHER NO. 48 several months back,      the first piece to catch my eye was Jane and Steve Fry's      "We Call 'Em 'Dough Babies"' (page 33). Though "dough      babies" were nothing new to me (I'd been creating them for      our family's Christmas tree since 1971), the article      inspired a totally different view of the tradition. After      ail, I'd been accumulating compliments on my homemade      trimmings for all these years . . . so why not collect some      profits on them as well?    </p>    <p>      With a total initial investment of under $3.00-404 for a      bag of white flour (purchased with a  cents-off coupon), 23!      for a box of salt, and $2.00 for a can of varnish-my      ornamental babies began popping to life by the dozens. At      the start I was so excited-and so eager to please (and to      make a profit)-that 1 wound up producing more than 300 tree      ornaments ... no two alike! And when customers saw both (1)      the uniqueness and [2] the quality of my work (a rare      combination these days), the business began to boom.    </p>    <p>      My sales center was a simple table at our thriving local      flea market. This approach gave me the chance to sell my      babies to good homes where I could be sure they'd be a part      of Christmas celebrations for years to come. And it made a      bit of swapping possible too. Recently, for instance, five      of my very best ornaments "bought" my daughter a warm coat      for the winter.    </p>    <p>      One tip I'd like to add to the Frys' guidelines, though:      Paint your babies with vivid, glow-in-the-dark colors      and-at Christmas time-shine a fluorescent black light on      your tree. The method is a great deal safer-and saves more      electricitythan traditional lighting . . . and it makes      your Christmas tree really come alive with animation.    </p>    <p>      I've got the "bug" now and just can't stop pan producing      dough babies of all kinds for all occasions. My experiments      with less seasonal forms of the art (got any suggestions,      folks?) must soon end, however. Otherwise I won't Nave time      to replenish my stock of Christmas ornaments before next      December rolls around!    </p>    <p>      Joellen Crouch 629 Meadowsweet Drive Corte Madera, Calif.      94925    </p>    <p>      I had just purchased a Troy-Biit rototillor in the fall of      '77, so I was quite interested when I came across Daniel      Ellison's article, "Have Rototiller, Will Travel", in      MOTHER NO. 32 (pages 90-92). Daniel had started quite an      impressive little business with his machine ... and after      reading his write-up I was spurred to do the same.    </p>    <p>      So-with my initial $610 investment already behind me-I      began a custom rototilling enterprise last fall. I started      by handing out 40 onepage ads in my neighborhood ... and      this canvassing brought a speedy reply. I quickly logged in      nine hours' work for a return of almost $200. Not bad for      my first try!    </p>    <p>      Now that it's spring, I've placed an ad (which I plan to      run for 12 weeks at a cost of $4.00 per week) in the local      newspaper. It reads:    </p>    <h3>      HAVE ROTOTILLER, WILL TRAVEL.    </h3>    <p>      Troy-Silt rototilling for gardens, new lawns, flowerbeds.      Experienced, reasonable. 835-1770.    </p>    <p>      So far I've already secured 30 customers for the season.      And at a 26 to 36per-squarefoot charge, 1 figure that-on      the average-I'll net about $20 an hour. I plan to work      approximately 20 hours per week for a period of eight weeks      ... and, by the end of 1978,1 expect that my rototiller      will have paid for Itself at least fourfold! Pretty good      for a 15-year-old, huh?    </p>    <p>      Don Moore Rye, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      I'm a gal with a host of varied interests and a love of      independence, who enjoys being self-sufficient and on her      own .. . but without MOTHER's help, I might never have had      this option. All it took was a pair of unrelated books from      Mother's Bookshelf to set me up in two separate selftaught      moneymaking businesses at the same time. I can't even      remember the correct titles (both publications were loans      from a friend) . . . but the subject matter is with me to      stay as the solid basis of my present two-part livelihood:      [1] mak]ng toys out of wood scraps, and (2) dyeing things      naturally with bark, berries, and flowers.    </p>    <p>      My toymaking business required only a few simple tools      (which I already had on hand), some small scraps of lumber      (which woodworking shops have been glad to give me), and a      little make-do ingenuity (sawdust, for example, is mixed      with Elmer's glue to affix wooden appendages to my      handicrafts). As a result, my single initial expense was an      inexpensive supply of wooden dowels.    </p>    <p>      So with modest-but fast-growing-resourcesiskilis/sales      outlets, I started producing doll beds, Tom-Tinker toys,      tot wagons windowsill cat perches, and cat beds (plywood      boxes with 3-inch legs). On-the-job experience has taught      me to secure all nuts and bolts with strong glue and to      spruce up my finished products with brightly colored,      leadfree enamels. My plain and simple toy designs can be      mailed knockeddown (1 include brief instructions for easy      assembly upon arrival) which dramatically expands any      potential i market. Andwherever possible-I incorporate my      own highly marketable "special touches" into the items I      make: cat decals and cushions fabricated from cat-print      fabric for the cat beds and perches, dainty fabric frills      for the doll beds, etc.    </p>    <p>      I stumbled into my second enterprise-fabric dyeing-as a      result of trying to restore my own faded,      ready-for-the-ragbag apparel. After carefully following the      tips outlined in one of those borrowed how-to books and      discovering that friends and acquaintances were admiring      the unusual colors and the "homespun look" that natural      dyes produced, I decided to try selling this work. And,      before I knew what was happening, I ended up in the dyeing      business.    </p>    <p>      This lucrative moneymaker was even easier to get into than      toymaking. I've been able to gather all the raw materials      for free in the Great Outdoors . . . so that even my      relatively small fee-$2.00 per garment-yields an ade. quate      profit (especially since I can work on several orders at      once on my trusty basement stove). Right from the start,      canvas- and floursack-type fabrics became my mostin-demand      craft materials, and I quickly developed a preference for      bark dyes (since they're easy to obtain and create a      variety of beautiful colors). My reward-above and beyond      the extra cash -can't be beat: the pleased and excited      reactions of my customers at the sight of their finished      products!    </p>    <p>      Over time I've found that local stores and personal      acquaintances provide ready outlets for both of the craft      goods 1 produce . .. and I often leave samples of my work      in selected shops, offering a 20% commission to the owners      for orders taken from the displays. My expenses are small      and my profits quite satisfactory, so that-in the end-1 net      approximately $300 per month from my toys and $100 per      month from my dyeing operation (not bad at all, considering      I work at home and set my own hours). And 1 know for sure      that the Income possibilities are limitless!    </p>    <p>      So who better to thank than you, MOTHER, for providing me      with the initial idea and the basic know-how!    </p>    <p>      Bernice C. Foster Baltimore, Md.    </p>    <p>      I'm an accountant by profession and, for that reason, I      found Bud Hopkins' article on the home preparation of      income tax returns (MOTHER NO. 50, pages 80-83) to be right      up my alley.    </p>    <p>      Since 1 already had a full-time job, though, and had always      thought that moonlighting would be more trouble than it was      worth, I was hesitant to give the idea a try. Still, Bud      had laid out such a neat plan of action in his write-up      that I soon decided to give a home- s based tax service a      whirl . . . at least on a part time basis.    </p>    <p>      With [1] a calculator (already in my posses sion) and [2]      access to a tax library (through my primary occupation), I      was ready to go with 4 no initial cost whatsoever. All that      remained to be done, then, was to "let out the word" that I      was available for after-hours tax preparation ... and in no      time flat, I was showered with more than enough clients to      keep me full-time; busy In my part-time hours.    </p>    <p>      And-as always-one good Idea from MOTHER soon led to      another. My home busi ness has opened the door to many      bartering possibilities as well. I now-for instancehave a      swapping arrangement with a fellow, accountant who also      prepares tax forms at home. I check the math on his work,      and he reviews the figures on mine.    </p>    <p>      Thanks, MOTHER, for giving me that extra push I needed      toward an enjoyable and flour ishing bootstrap business.    </p>    <p>      James A.
