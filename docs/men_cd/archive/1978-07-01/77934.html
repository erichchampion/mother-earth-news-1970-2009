    <p>
                        <p>      <strong>Can you name a quick, easy, inexpensive way to [1]      clean up the nation's highways, [2] reduce the amount of      garbage in the city and county dumps, [3] save      <em>billions</em> of dollars each and every year [4] create      over 100,000 new jobs, and [5] conserve more than seven      million tons of glass, steel, and aluminum every 12      months...as well as enuogh energy to warm some two million      American homes for an entire year? Sure...</strong>    </p>    <p>      Back in the 1940's and 50's-when a few of MOTHER's      more elderly staffers were still children-you could      keep yourself in chewing gum, candy, and other teeth      rotters by scrounging up and redeeming empty pop and beer      bottles ... which in those days had a price on their heads!      For example, in 1947-when almost all soft-drink and      beer containers sold were refillable-small bottles      fetched 2 cents and quarts 5 cents apiece at any corner      grocery or liquor store.    </p>    <p>      Pickin's weren't easy, though, because hardly anyone tossed      out these treasures ... which'd just pile up on the back      porch-or in the garage-until someone would      finally remember to haul 'em down to the market for a      refund. In other words, even those few pennies on each      bottle were enough to make sure that 95 percent of the      containers found their way back to the bottling plants for      a refill . . . and most were used 10 to 15 times-or      more!-before either loss or breakage retired them      from circulation.    </p>    <h3>      NO DEPOSIT, NO RETURN    </h3>    <p>      Bottlemakers, of course, would have preferred a slightly      less durable product, but it wasn't until the late 50's      that they finally managed to formulate a glass strong      enough to withstand the rigors of filling and shipping once      . . . but too flimsy to endure them a second time!      Meanwhile, the steel industry had been successfully      promoting beverage cans since the end of World War II and,      by 1960, the beer can had become a firmly entrenched      artifact of American life . . . a monument to "convenience"      scattered abundantly along the nation's roadsides.    </p>    <p>      Even at that late date (1960), though, you could still buy      almost all your soft drinks and half your beer in      refillable bottles. As the 60's wore on, however, the noble      returnable-for-deposit glass container steadily lost ground      first to the steel-and then the aluminum-can .      . . and finally, to the "twist-top, no-deposit, noreturn"      bottle (which has since joined its throwaway metal      counterparts along America's highways and byways by the      tens of millions).    </p>    <p>      Today, a youngster trying to make a living off returnable      bottles would go broke in most states . . . for about 85      percent of all the nation's beer and 62 percent of its soda      pop now arrives at the store in throw aways. In 1975 alone,      for example, Americans purchased 65 BILLION "one-way"      bottles and cans of brew and bubble water. And the less      conscientious among us tossed over four billion of those      containers out somewhere alongside our roads and trails      (that was half the total volume of roadside litter!). The      rest of the one-way cans and bottles-about eight      tons' worth-made up about 10 percent of the junk in      the country's public dumps.    </p>    <h3>      HIDDEN COSTS    </h3>    <p>      Under the good old deposit system of soft drink and beer      distribution, of course, you buy only the beverage . . .      and borrow the bottle. But with today's throwaways, you      purchase the containers too! And they cost you about      7 cents each. Now this may seem like a piddling amount, but      if the nation switched completely to refillable containers      tomorrow, consumers would save a total of $1.8 billion      during the following 365 days!    </p>    <p>      In addition to this obvious and direct cost, each and every      one of us-including folks who don't even drink beer      or soda pop-must pay a hidden price for the dubious      "convenience" of disposable beverage containers, too. The      billions of dollars taxpayers fork out each year just to      pick up litter and process solid waste, for example, don't      show up at the checkout stand . . . but must be figured      into the actual cost of throwaway containers.    </p>    <p>      And even these hefty sums are small change compared to the      value of the resources and energy wasted on the manufacture      of one-way cans and bottles. The U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that if a law requiring      deposits on beverage containers were to go into effect by      1980-which seems unlikely at this point-the      nation would save 5.2 million tons of glass, 1.5 million      tons of steel, 500,000 tons of aluminum, and energy equal      to about 41 million barrels of crude oil . . . EACH YEAR!    </p>    <h3>      COUNTERATTACK    </h3>    <p>      Although seven out of 10 people in this country favor some      kind of law to require deposits on beverage containers,      politicians in your state capitals and in Congress too have      been slow (as always) to catch up with this good idea. So      far, only six states-Oregon, Vermont, Michigan,      Maine, Connecticut, and Iowa-have "bottle bills" (as      such laws are frequently called) on the books.    </p>    <p>      Good oI Oregon-which seems to be chock-full of      ecology-minded folks these days-was the first state      to ban the throwaway. Its bottle bill, passed in 1972,      levies a 5 cents deposit on beverage (beer, soft drink,      mineral water, and soda water) containers . . . and forbids      the use of pull-tab cans. In addition, it authorizes a      special "certified" container-designed by the      state-which carries a 2 cents deposit and can be used      by any bottler who wishes.    </p>    <p>      As you might expect, the container lobby (which-in      addition to can and bottle manufacturers-includes      steel and aluminum companies, metalworkers' unions,      supermarket chains, and major brewers and soft-drink      bottlers) predicted a number of dire consequences for      Oregon if the law passed. Since a lot of you folks might      like to help your state adopt a bottle bill, it's      worthwhile to compare these predictions with the real      facts. (That way, when the lobby tries to sell the same old      horse in your neck of the woods, you can put the nag out of      its misery before some other poor soul buys it on faith.)    </p>    <h3>      WHAT WENT RIGHT IN OREGON?    </h3>    <p>      DIRE PREDICTION NO. 1: The bottle bill will not reduce      litter.    </p>    <p>      FACT: Each year since the bill went into effect, 380      million fewer beverage containers have wound up alongside      Oregon roads or in public dumps. Total litter in the state      is down by 40 percent!    </p>    <p>      DIRE PREDICTION NO. 2: Beverage prices will rise and sales      will fall.    </p>    <p>      FACT: Oregon beer prices and sales have kept pace with      national trends. Though accurate figures are not available,      the same appears to hold true for soft drinks as well.    </p>    <p>      DIRE PREDICTION NO. 3: The bottle bill will cause a loss of      jobs.    </p>    <p>      FACT: A 1974 study by Oregon State University reported that      the bill had actually created a net gain of 365 jobs. A      loss of 350 jobs in production was more than offset by 615      new positions in the areas of delivery, warehousing, and      retailing. The total payroll for beverage-related jobs rose      $1.6 million!    </p>    <p>      DIRE PREDICTION NO. 4: People won't return bottles and      cans.    </p>    <p>      FACT: Thanks to the bottle bill, about 95 percent of all      Oregonians now return 95 percent of all the beverage      containers they buy. Nine out of ten of these folks think      the bottle bill is great!    </p>    <p>      And, in addition to the above benefits, the elimination of      throwaway beverage containers has saved the state enough      energy (1.4 trillion Btu's) to heat the homes of 50,000      residents!    </p>    <h3>      ENTER MADISON AVENUE    </h3>    <p>      "Fine," you say. "But if Oregon's bottle bill is such a      smashing success, why have folks in eight other states      since rejected ballot propositions to establish similar      returnable bottle laws?"    </p>    <p>      Because after its humiliating defeat in Oregon, the      container lobby geared up in earnest to smash bottle bills      wherever they appeared. Altogether the lobby currently      employs some 1,000 people-full time!-in this      effort.    </p>    <p>      William Coors, president of the Adolf Coors Brewing      Company-and the only major brewer to support      container legislatione-stimates that his less      enlightened colleagues and their allies spend about $20      million a year to beat back popular bottle-bill campaigns.      In the state of Washington, for example, the lobby      squelched a ballot measure by flinging $300,000 worth of      misleading propaganda at the voters. The folks supporting      the initiative spent only $6,000.    </p>    <p>      Since facts do not support its case, the container gang      makes up its own . . . and pays big bucks to slick Madison      Avenue PR firms who dress up the industry's collection of      innuendoes, red herrings, and downright lies with nuts and      cherries and chocolate syrup ... so you and I will swallow      the garbage with a big grin.    </p>    <p>      During the 1976 bottle-bill campaign in Maine, for example,      an industry representative suggested in a public debate      that the proposed law would place a deposit on mayonnaise      jars! Maine passed the legislation despite this terrifying      prospect. Similarly, during the fight to pass a deposit law      in Dade County, Florida, the PR firm hired by the container      lobby ran a newspaper ad suggesting that the legislation      would apply to all cans . .. not just those for beer and      soft drinks. Dade County rejected the proposal. Throughout      the country, the container lobby has repeatedly warned that      bottle bills will raise beverage prices, cost jobs, and      limit the consumer's "freedom of choice" . .. even though      all available evidence points to the opposite conclusion.    </p>    <h3>      ENTER THE WEEPING INDIAN    </h3>    <p>      Now, should anyone think the can and bottle companies and      their fellow travelers oppose bottle bills out of sheer      selfinterest (God forbid) . . . why they'd like to set you      straight! The industry claims to be as much against litter      as the next guy . . . but what can it do? After all:      "People start pollution. People can stop it."    </p>    <p>      Yes, that's the familiar slogan of Keep America Beautiful      (KAB) . . . the folks who bring you the weeping Indian on      TV. KAS is quite simply an industry front whose main job      the past few years has been to divert your attention from      deposit legislation by suggesting that if you and your      friends would just quit tossing trash around ... there      would be no problem. After all, the container lobby only      makes, promotes, and sells nonreturnable bottles and cans!      How could it be to blame?    </p>    <p>      The next time you see a KAB free "public service" spot on      the tube, then, remember that [1] for starters, people can      stop pollution by banning throwaways, and that [2] litter      is only a small part of the problem with non-returnables.    </p>    <p>      Before 1974, several prominent conservation      organizations-among them the Sierra Club and the      Wilderness Society-sponsored KAB's activities ... but      after Roger Powers, the KAS president, testified against a      proposed bottle bill in California, several of these groups      quickly resigned. Even more jumped for shore after KAB's      1976 meeting, when William F. May-head man at the      American Can Company-called bottle-bill supporters      "Communists". So much for KAB.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT ABOUT LOCAL BREWERS?    </h3>    <p>      Even though bottle bills create jobs, save money, energy,      and resources, and reduce litter and solid waste ... you'd      naturally be downright flabbergasted if the container      industry-and suppliers of steel and      aluminum-didn't fight them with every weapon at their      disposal. And it's not even too tough to figure out that      supermarket chains prefer to handle merchandise-or      the containers it comes in-only once . . . when it's      generating income at the cash register.    </p>    <p>      But where do the major brewers and soft-drink bottlers fit      into the picture? Why do Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, and the      Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company-among other      firms-fight so hard to preserve throwaway containers?      After all, wouldn't they actually save money by using      bottles over again . . . instead of buying new ones      constantly?    </p>    <p>      The answer is a resounding "NO" ... and the reasons why      reveal the American corporate mind at its devious,      rapacious best (or worst).    </p>    <p>      First, instead of just passing the additional cost of      throwaway containers on to consumers, the big beer and soda      pop companies actually jack up the price of products sold      in such containers to include a hefty profit on those very      bottles and cans . . . items that they didn't even      manufacture! In short, you pay a markup for the package as      well as the potable when you buy anything in a throwaway      container ... and, of course, industry likes it that way.    </p>    <p>      Second . . . well, let's get an insider to tell it in his      own words: Peter Chokola runs an independent bottling      operation in a small Pennsylvania town near Wilkes Barre.      He is an outspoken advocate of mandatory      deposits-which he says will help the small operator      like himself-and charges that big bottlers such as      CocaCola are out to run the little guys out of business      across the nation.    </p>    <p>      "Why the headlong rush by certain segments of the American      bottling industry towards conversion to one-way disposable      containers?" asked Peter in a 1973 speech. "The answer is      ... MONOPOLY! It becomes obvious to any competent industry      observer that the returnable-reusable deposit bottle      imposes a natural limitation on the market area served from      any bottling plant ... the limitation being how far      delivery trucks can carry the filled bottles and return      with the empties!"    </p>    <p>      In short, since the big bottlers no longer have to worry      about returns, they can ship their products halfway across      the country if necessary. Which means they can invade the      small territories that local brewers and soft-drink      companies once had mostly to themselves.    </p>    <p>      Back in 1958, for example-when refill. ables were      still the mainstay of the beverage industry-America      could boast 184 breweries ... many of them family owned and      operated. These small, local operations brewed distinctive      beers from old-time recipes often handed down for      generations. And by every standard used to judge a good      beer, these local "suds" were vastly superior to the      mass-produced dishwater now on the market.    </p>    <p>      Today, however, there are only about 50 breweries left in      the country! Why? Because most of the small, local      operations could make it only so long as refillable bottles      cut down their overhead and prevented larger outfits from      barging into their territories. The story in the soft-drink      industry is largely the same.    </p>    <p>      Which brings up the point behind Oregon's "certifiable"      bottle. Since this standardized, state-authorized container      has no distinctive shape or marking associated with any      particular brand of beer or soda pop ... anyone can use it!      Which means that once again-in Oregon at      least-small operators have a plentiful supply of      inexpensive bottles.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, the large bottlers hate the "certified"      container . . . but so far they've had to live with it in      at least one state. You can be sure, though, that if and      when Congress finally gets around to passing a national      deposit law, the "certified" bottle won't be included! The      container lobby will extract at least this      concession-and as many others as it can possibly      get-as the price of passage.    </p>    <h3>      HOW GOES IT ON CAPITOL HILL?    </h3>    <p>      Slo-o-o-owly ... as usual. Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield      first introduced national bottle legislation back in 1973      (a year after his state pioneered the reform) and his bill      (S. 276) still languishes before the Commerce Subcommittee      on Consumer Affairs. Although this august group held      informational hearings last January-and bottle-bill      advocates were pleased with the results-no action is      likely to be taken this election year.    </p>    <p>      In the House prospects are even bleaker ... because Vermont      Representative Jim Jeffords' bill (H.R. 936) is firmly      stuck in the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Subcommittee      on Transportation and Commerce. Now it just so happens that      the chairman of this subcommittee-Representative Fred      Rooney-hails from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania ... where      steel i (and presumably the steel can) reigns supreme! So      don't hold your breath for the Jeffords bill.    </p>    <p>      But take heart! Even though Congress is poking along on      this issue so far, it's just a matter of time before it      takes a deep breath, hitches up its collective drawers, and      passes national deposit legislation. Fact is, the time is      ripe for bottle bills. The reasons for passing      them-to save energy and resources, create jobs,      pacify consumers and environmentalists-are the right      reasons (in the political sense) at this particular      juncture in our history.    </p>    <p>      Consider: Politicians want to appear eager to champion      energy conservation, but most of 'em don't dare cross      swords with the black knight of the American "Camelot"...      BIG OIL! A bottle bill, however, allows legislators to go      to their constituents and say, "Look, I voted for a law      that saves energy, creates jobs, reduces litter and solid      waste, and lowers the price of beer and soft drinks!" . . .      all this, without having to risk a politically dangerous      confrontation with the energy lobby (which plays a whole      lot rougher than the container gang).    </p>    <h3>      GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD    </h3>    <p>      Even so, without a show of strong, persistent, vocal      support from all of us-you, me, and our      friends-who want to outlaw disposable beverage      containers once and for all, state and federal legislators      are going to have a rough time resisting the brute      political leverage freely applied by the container lobby.    </p>    <p>      Up till now, the fight to pass bottle bills has fallen      almost entirely on the shoulders of small citizen groups      scattered throughout the 50 states . . . little bands of      activists who've put in all the time, money, and labor      while most of us have only sat back and applauded. And      while these folks have done one helluva job-with few      helping hands and little cash-they can't do it all.      The time has come for the rest of us to pitch in and help!    </p>    <p>      Here, in short, is a golden chance to save energy, conserve      resources, and eliminate waste from our lives-and      help other people do so too-on a grand scale! That's      why MOTHER has taken this space to tell you about bottle      bills ... and why she's now asking you to help in whatever      way you can to get them danged throw away containers banned      and out of our lives once and for all!    </p>            <h3>      WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP    </h3>    <p>      [1] Learn more about bottle bills, especially what's going      on in your particular state.
