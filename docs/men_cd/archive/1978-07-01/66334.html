                        <hr />    <p>      Hendersonville, North Carolina (MOTHER's home base) may be      a <em>quiet</em> little settlement (in fact - most      nights - you can hear a pine needle drop after 10      o'clock), but it's blessed with two excellent natural food      restaurants . . . which is more than most small mountain      towns (and some real cities) can boast!    </p>        <p>      We've already told you about The Merry Miller and shared      some of Leona Farquhar's recipes with you (see the      centerfolds in Issue Nos. 46 and 49), and now we'd like to      introduce you to Paul Corpening and Deborah Dunn ... owners      and operators of The Herb Garden Cafe    </p>    <p>      Paul and Deborah opened their place (which does indeed look      like an indoor herb garden) on a shoestring, and have only      recently been able to hire their first paid helper (Lynda      Flanagan, who's on the left in the picture). But being      short of hands hasn't prevented the young entrepreneurs      from dishing up consistently delectable fare . . . which      brings us to the real subject of this article! Along with      many other good foods, the cafe serves sandwiches made (for      the most part) of perfectly ordinary, everyday ingredients      . . . yet somehow those plump meals-in-themselves always      turn out to be extraordinarily tasty.    </p>    <p>      The secret, say Deborah and Paul, is in the freshness and      wholesomeness of their sandwich "fixings" . . . and in the      wonderful breads in which those fixings are nestled. The      Herb Garden Cafe, you see, gets its whole grain loaves      right out of the oven, from a local husband-and-wife-team      small home bakery called Our Daily Bread.    </p>    <p>      And that team, Richard and Marilyn Colgan, not only turn      out-unassisted-many varieties of warm, crusty bread      each week (varieties like Black Russian, Sourdough Rye,      Swedish Limpa Rye, Herb and Onion, Sprouted Wheat, and      Yogurt Wheat Germ), but they also produce and sell large      batches of creamy, delicate tofu. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Watch for      more about the. Colgans and their business in an upcoming      issue.)    </p>    <p>      Now, you may not have such a good source of bread and      soybean curd at your fingertips (unless you make your own),      but you can still put together superlative sandwiches like      the ones pictured here if you faithfully follow Paul and      Deborah's recipes.    </p>    <p>      All but one of the following . sandwiches is spread with a      special herb butter, and the originators of the butter      stress that-in this recipe as in each of the      others-fresh herbs make all the difference where      flavor's concerned and should be used whenever possible.    </p>    <h3>      HERB BUTTER    </h3>    <p>      1 / 2 pound farm-fresh or safflower oil butter    </p>    <p>      1-1 / 2 teaspoons chili powder    </p>    <p>      1 /2 teaspoon minced garlic or garlic powder    </p>    <p>      1-1 / 2 teaspoons basil    </p>    <p>      1 teaspoon Vege-Sal or other vegetable salt    </p>    <p>      1 teaspoon oregano    </p>    <p>      Let the butter sit at room temperature until it's soft      enough to allow you to thoroughly cream the other      ingredients into it.    </p>    <h3>      EGGLESS EGG SALAD SANDWICH    </h3>    <p>      2 pounds tofu    </p>    <p>      1 teaspoon turmeric    </p>    <p>      1 teaspoon dry mustard    </p>    <p>      1 tablespoon Vege-Sal or other vegetable salt    </p>    <p>      1-1 / 2 teaspoons celery seed    </p>    <p>      1-1 / 2 teaspoons oregano    </p>    <p>      1-1/2 teaspoons parsley    </p>    <p>      1 teaspoon dill leaves    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons primary yeast flakes    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons safflower oil mayonnaise    </p>    <p>      1 / 2 cup minced onion 3 stalks celery, chopped sliced      bread Herb Butter alfalfa sprouts    </p>    <p>      Crumble the tofu into a large bowl (Peal and Deborah use      their hands for this . . . they say a fork just doesn't do      the job right), and add the remaining ingredients, stirring      well as each one goes into the bowl. This recipe will yield      enough filling for abort 20 sandwiches (if you want to make      less, just reduce all amounts by half), and they'll be      especially good if you toast the slices of bread before      spreading them with some of the Herb Butter. Add a generous      layer of "eggless egg salad" and a big handful of alfalfa      sprouts to each sandwich, slice your finished product in      two so it'll be more manageable, and chow down. You'll find      this does taste like egg salad . . . only better!    </p>    <h3>      PEANUT BUTTER AND FRUIT SANDWICH    </h3>    <p>      sliced bread a good natural peanut butter with no salt or      hydrogenated oil fruit butter (either the Pure and Simple      brand, which is made with cherries, or a good apple butter)      sliced banana sliced strawberries raisins (optional)    </p>    <p>      For each sandwich, spread one slice of bread with peanut      butter and the other with fruit butter, then add a layer of      the banana slices and one of sliced strawberries. A      sprinkling of raisins makes an appealing addition.    </p>    <h3>      VEGETABLE-CHEESE SANDWICH    </h3>    <p>      sliced tomato sliced avocado shredded carrot chopped onion      any other fresh vegetable in season (zucchini, yellow      squash, spinach, etc.) sliced cheese of your choice (such      as Monterey Jack, Cheddar, or Swiss)    </p>    <p>      sliced bread    </p>    <p>      Herb Butter    </p>    <p>      alfalfa sprouts    </p>    <p>      Assemble the ingredients in Dagwood fashion . . . and The      Herb Garden folks recommend a dark bread like Black Russian      or pumpernickel for this one!    </p>    <h3>      TOFU AND OLIVES SANDWICH    </h3><p>2 pounds tofu</p>    <p>      1-1/2 teaspoons basil    </p>    <p>      1-1 / 2 teaspoons crushed rosemary    </p>    <p>      1-1 / 2 teaspoons celery seed    </p>    <p>      1 tablespoon soy sauce or Dr. Bronner's Bouillon (or to      taste)    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons primary yeast flakes    </p>    <p>      1 / 2 teaspoon minced garlic or garlic powder    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons safflower oil mayonnaise    </p>    <p>      1 / 4 cup minced onion    </p>    <p>      2 stalks celery, chopped 1 / 3 cup salad olives sliced      bread Herb Butter alfalfa sprouts    </p>    <p>      Crumble the tofu and combine with the other ingredients in      a large bowl. This recipe, too, will provide filling for      about 20 sandwiches . . . which should be assembled the      same way the "eggless egg" ones are. Only-for Tofu      and Olives-Deborah and Paul recommend rye bread,      which you can toast or not (according to your preference).    </p>    <p>      As our title says, these recipes come to you with love from      The Herb Garden Cafe. Which reminds us that the only      ingredient we failed to mention in the above formulations      is the good vibrations that just naturally radiate      throughout Paul and Deborah's establishment. Don't forget      to add a few of these to your sandwiches too!.    </p>    <hr />
