                    <h2 id="subtitle">      THE COLD SUMMER SOUP FROM SPAIN    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by JEAN CAMPBELL    </h5>    <hr />        <p>      When the days are so warm (here in my hometown of      Hollywood, Maryland) that everything-and      everybody-seems to wilt, I like to prepare gazpacho .      . . a chilled dish that's a delicious tradition in its      native Spain.    </p>    <p>      The Latin specialty is an especially good summertime treat      because it calls for several of the vegetables that we      always have in such abundance this time of the year:      tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers . . . and-if you      wish-even zucchini and other summer squashes!    </p>    <p>      Better still, the spicy soup is satisfying enough to enjoy      as an economical main dish on days when the temperature's      so high you don't want to cook.    </p>    <p>      Here's my recipe for about two quarts of the cooling      crowd-pleaser:</p><p>      3 pounds (about 4 or 5) very ripe tomatoes<br />      2 medium-sized cucumbers<br />      1/2 cup green pepper, minced<br />      2 medium-sized summer squashes (optional)<br />      1/2 cup onion, minced<br />      1or 2 cloves garlic, minced<br />      2 cups tomato juice or water<br />      <br />      3 tablespoons vinegar<br />      3 tablespoons olive oil or corn oil (purists may disagree,      but I've found this ingredient to be optional)<br />      Tabasco sauce to taste, or 1 small hot red pepper, finely      minced, salt and pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      Peel and chop the tomatoes and cucumbers, reserving any      juice for the soup, and combine them with the remaining      ingredients in a large bowl or tureen. According to your      preference, you can [1] puree any or all of the vegetables      in a blender, [2] simply dice them, or [3] whirl them in      the blender only briefly, so that enough chunks remain to      make the soup more interesting to eat.    </p>    <p>      If you choose to add some variety of summer squash (which      will not change the flavor appreciably and is a good way to      use these prolific vegetables), first steam the squash, let      them cool, and then mash or puree them.    </p>    <p>      Thoroughly chill the gazpacho in its mixing/serving vessel,      then ladle it into soup bowls and serve it with either      bread sticks or crackers. Mmm . . . mmm . . . good!    </p>    <hr />
