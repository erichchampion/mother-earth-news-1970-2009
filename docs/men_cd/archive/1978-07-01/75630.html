                    <hr />    <p>      Regular readers of this column know that it has repeatedly      pinned today's terrifying inflation, steady erosion of      social values, and most of the other ills which now plague      the world squarely on the fuzzy-brained,      give-everybody-everything politicians and economists who      have so drastically mismanaged the planet's economy since      the end of World War II.    </p>    <p>      And, for a long time, it did about as much good as      hollerin' down a rain barrel. But the tide is beginning to      turn! All of a sudden, in fact, it seems that      everyone-from U.S. Senate staffer to liberal college      professor to ghetto resident-is beginning to understand how      we all got into the fix we're now in . . . is beginning to      understand that mushrooming Big Government-and the      pinheaded bureaucrats which staff it-is the cause of      (and in no way a solution for) the problems we currently      face. Some evidence: "I don't really think government can      do much about inflation," said Little Jimmy Carter back in      the spring in answer to a newsman's question. Well, maybe      our President really is that naive (after all, he did say      he'd never tell us a lie) ... but Business Week magazine      isn't. The periodical's May 22, 1978 issue-in      fact-was built around a hard-hitting cover story      ("The Great Government Inflation Machine") that laid the      cards out on the table where even a barefoot boy from      Georgia could see them. Some quotes:    </p>    <p>      "Anyone who is not at least mildly panicked about the      inflation outlook for the U.S. does not recognize the      seriousness of the situation . . . . The grim fact is that      the country is caught in the grip of the worst, most      prolonged, and most pernicious inflation in its history.      Inflation has reached the point where it is destroying the      nation's efforts to achieve solid economic growth, is      wrecking the financial markets, and is blasting the      retirement hopes of everyone over 65 years of age .... And      this is happening because of-not in spite      of-the way that the democratic decision-making      process works in Washington .... The real villain is the      federal government which has been running huge deficits for      years.    </p>    <p>      "For a decade and a half, the U.S. has pursued seductive,      self-deluding economic policies .... Instead of      contributing to the well-being of the nation, these      policies have generated a disastrous rise in costs and      prices that strains the fabric of American society and      threatens to paralyze the American economy. If President      Carter plunges ahead on the same course, he will risk not      just a painful inflation and a subsequent depression but a      breakdown in the whole economic and political structure of      the country."    </p>    <p>      Are taxes starting to get you down? Do you sometimes feel      that the government now asks too much? Does it frequently      seem that all those federal taxes, state taxes, county      taxes, sales taxes, inventory taxes, excise taxes, property      taxes, social security taxes, and all the other taxes that      you now "voluntarily" pay . . . add up to an intolerable      burden?    </p>    <p>      You're not alone. Senate staffer Paul Craig Roberts has      done a little homework on the subject and-in a recent      issue of Harper's Magazine-stated: "In relative terms      our position today is worse than that of a medieval serf,      who owed the state one-third of his working time. In 1976      government had a claim to 42% of the U.S. national income."    </p>    <p>      Mr. Roberts also explained why the criminals in Washington      love to blather on so much about "tax reform to help the      poor" and why the same miscreants always pretend to "fight"      inflation while secretly doing everything in their power to      encourage it. "Tax reform to help the poor is easy," says      Roberts. "The poor don't pay any taxes. And inflation is a      boon for our free-spending politicians because it pushes      citizens into higher tax brackets faster than their incomes      rise. A 10% rate of inflation, for instance, produces a      16.5% revenue gain for the government."    </p>    <p>      And if you've sorta halfway suspected that the cost of      everything you've bought in the last few years has      skyrocketed-at least in part-because of a      sudden overload of wasteful and counterproductive drones in      Washington . . . you're absolutely right. The Center for      the Study of American Business at Washington University in      St. Louis has released a report which says that the      combined budgets of just the federal government's 41      regulatory agencies have mushroomed from $2.24 billion (in      fiscal 1974) to a projected $4.82 billion (for fiscal      1979).    </p>    <p>      "This is a direct measure of the rising intervention of      government in the economy," stated Murray L. Weidenbaum,      the center's director, in a Wall Street Journal interview.      "These expenditures represent a growth rate that is      unsurpassed by the federal budget as a whole, the      population, the gross national product, or any other      applicable basis for comparison.    </p>    <p>      "Furthermore, our overriding concern isn't just the $4.82      billion that the federal government will spend on      regulation in 1979 .. . but the costs that business will      then incur as it complies with those regulations. Our      studies indicate that there's about a 20-to-1 multiplier      effect involved. Which means that government regulatory      actions in 1979 could easily cost business close to $100      billion. And that extra $100 billion, of course, will      ultimately be passed on to the consumer."    </p>    <p>      And how does all that government regulation hit the      consumer (you) in the pocketbook? One example: The U.S.      Labor Department estimates that licensed workers of one      kind or another now make up an in credible 25% of the      employed labor force in some states. "But that's good," you      may say. "It guarantees that I'll have a qualified,      competent person to turn to when I need a critical job      done. It means the work will be handled in a professional      manner. It means I won't be overcharged."    </p>    <p>      Think again. Business Week reports that-after two      years of analyzing 31 occupations ranging from embalmers to      real-estate brokers-economists at the University of      Tennessee in Knoxville have concluded: "The more stringent      the licensing requirements, the lower the quantity and      quality of service consumers receive. Licensing produces a      `Cadillac effect' by providing high-quality service for      high-income consumers. But those on low incomes, who      cannot afford to pay the higher price, are forced to go      without service, do it themselves, or rely on lowpriced,      unlicensed `quacks'."    </p>    <p>      More specifically, the study found that consumers are      forced to do their own plumbing far more often in states      with stricter licensing .. . that houses stay on the market      longer in states with more stringent real estate licensing      requirements ... that the seven states with the strictest      rules for the licensing of electricians have up to 10 times      more accidental electrocutions than the national average.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, another study-run by Stuart Dorsey of      Western Illinois University-has demonstrated that      occupational licensing (which requires written as well as      practical tests) discriminates against minorities and the      poor. (Blacks fail barber and cosmetologist written exams      40% more often than whites, and high-school dropouts      fail 15% more often than high-school graduates.)    </p>    <p>      Whether you love these results or hate them, there's one      thing that's hard to deny: Here is yet another example of      your tax dollars being used against you to increase the      prices you pay for everyday items and services, lower the      quality of those items and services . . . and isolate you      from the opportunity and upward mobility that the free      enterprise system is supposed to make available.    </p>    <p>      And whatever happened to all those sinister professors who      were supposed to be subverting the U.S. free enterprise      system from secure tenured teaching positions on college      campuses across the land? Maybe they never existed in the      first place ... or, if they did, they must have had a      dramatic change of heart.    </p>    <p>      A national survey conducted for the Chronicle of Higher      Education found that a full 81 % of all the college      professors in the country agree that "the private business      system in the U.S., for all its flaws, works better than      any other system devised for advanced industrial society"      ...    </p>    <p>      that "the growth of government in the U.S. now poses a      threat to the freedom and opportunity for individual      initiative of the citizenry" . . . and that "economic      growth, not redistribution, should be the primary objective      of American economic policy".    </p>    <p>      Another surprise. If you think the traditionally liberal      teaching establishment is swinging to the right, you ain't      heard nothin' yet: So is the ghetto! A poll of the poor,      down-and-out residents of New York City's notorious      southwest Bronx-for instance-has revealed that they      favor tougher welfare regulations by a 77 to 16% majority      ... stricter sentences for looters by 95 to 2% . . .      restitution of the death penalty by 66 to 29% ... heavier      punishment of juvenile offenders by 89 to 7% . . . and an      80 to 16% majority like the idea of making welfare      recipients earn their "paychecks" by cleaning New York      City's filthy streets.    </p>		<hr />
