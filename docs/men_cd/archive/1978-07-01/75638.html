                    <hr />        <p>      Copthorne Macdonald is the inventor of slow-scan television      . . . a method of amateur radio transmission that allows      ham operators to both hear and see each other during      shortwave broadcasts.    </p>    <h3>      MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS    </h3>    <p>      Remember that old saying: "Time flies when you're having      fun"? Maybe it's that ... or maybe it's the time speedup      phenomenon that accompanies getting older. In any case, it      recently struck me that New Directions Radio began five      whole years ago.. . 30 MOTHERs into the past!    </p>    <p>      Those of you who were reading MOTHER back then may recall      the two factors that gave birth to this column. The first      was a profound disenchantment-on my part, and on the part      of many other hams -with "mainstream ham radio", and the      typical hello-goodbye, trivia-filled on-the-air "contact"      or "QSO"that goes (or used to go) with it. The second      factor was my (and other folks') realization that ham radio      could be an exceedingly powerful tool for      back-tothe-landers. Amateur radio can (among other things)      help relieve "cabin fever", provide fast two-way      communication in times of emergency, and act as a      day-to-day conduit for the exchange of useful information.    </p>    <p>      So thanks, in part, to the contacts we've been able to make      through MOTHER, a number of us who shared this particular      understanding of ham radio's usefulness got together on the      air, and graduallyover a period of years-a "new directions"      network took shape and grew. During this same period, of      course, the rest of the world hasn't exactly stood still      either: In fact, mainstream society's attitudes and      outlooks have begun to change dramatically . . . in our      direction.    </p>    <p>      Last year, for instance, MOTHER reported the results of a      Harris survey which showed that for a majority of      Americans, increased material gains were no longer a top      priority in life. The Stanford Research Institute recently      reported to businessmen on a growing trend toward      "voluntary simplicity" in daily living. Even politicians      are beginning to see and admit the energy realities that      only a few ecologists, wholesystem analysts, and MOTHER      types saw ti-ma years ago. The point 1' m leading up to is      that mainstream amateur radio is a more "aware" place to      hang out now than it used to be . . . and if you go about      it the right way, it's possible to have some very      meaningful, very interesting conversations these days with      hams who may not be familiar with MOTHER-or New Directions      Radio-at all.    </p>    <p>      Trivia is still "in", of course, as a topic of conversation      . . . and breaking through such "time of day" exchanges      still requires some extra effort. George Land has pointed      out that before two individuals can explore their      differences in a constructive way, they must first explore      together some of the things they have in common. Thus, the      usual ham practice of discussing equipment and the weather      can be looked at as a natural and perhaps necessary      "introductory ritual". The technical side of ham radio is      something that all hams have in common, and each of us can      relate to the other person's weather . . . these subjects      are obviously safe conversation openers.    </p>    <p>      All too often, however, the conversation closes immediately      after the opener. The other fellow heads off to chase      another "contact". Fortunately, though, there are ways to      get around this problem: Joe Reed, WB9JXU (Rt. 1, Box 24,      Mountain, Wisconsin 54149)-for instance-has discovered the      secret of how to go beyond the introductory ritual and turn      a QSO into a real conversation.    </p>    <p>      "The key," says Joe, "is to ask questions. Ask the guy who      he is. What he does. Where his head is at. People love to      talk about themselves . . . and will do so at length when      you ask the right questions. And whenever you hit on an      interesting topic, follow up on it. Be active in your      questions, and-when you can-add to the conversation. I'm      not saying that you're going to enjoy talking to everybody      ... you probably won't. But as soon as you hook up with a      person who seems to be into something interesting, you have      to follow up."    </p>    <p>      Joe is a QRP (low power) operator, which (for him) makes      the pursuit of "real" conversations all the more      challenging. Reed, however, has learned to make the best of      the situation: "As soon as the other person learns that you      are QRP," explains Joe, "his curiosity about this strange      mode that you're using is usually pretty intense . . . so      even the shy operator has an initial opening to start a      conversation.    </p>    <p>      "While my question-asking technique applies to both code      and voice, I generally prefer code because interference is      less of a factor with this mode and you spend less time      repeating yourself." Joe adds: "We radio operators are sure      a diverse group. I'm a graduate student in geography,      although I work in finance. I've had fantastic      conversations with farmers, professors, engineers,      housewives, you name it. The crucial factor in getting      beyond the "trivia" stage in each case-I've found-is      wanting to talk to people rather than wanting to be heard      along way away."    </p>    <p>      In summary, there are many kindred souls and a lot of      interesting conversations to be discovered these days in      mainstream ham radio . . . because the timesand people's      heads-are changing. By using Joe Reed's simple technique of      asking questions, we can often transcend the "safe" but      sterile ritual of talking about the weather ... and enjoy a      genuine, honest-for-real conversation.    </p>    <h3>      NEWSLETTER UPDATE    </h3>    <p>      Several <strong>months back, Bo Bogardus (W6HSE) put out a call      asking for someone to come forward and act as East Coast      Editor of the NDR Newsletter.</strong> Larry Kahaner (WB2NEL/1)--a      <strong>science writer by trade-has graciously volunteered to take</strong>      on that duty. "I write all day anyway," Larry says ...      which is probably a good reason for us to be extra grateful      for Kahaner's offer. (1 don't see how we're making his job      any easier!)    </p>    <p>      So from now on, those of you in the East or Midwest who      have items for the Newsletter, please send them directly to      Larry Kahaner, 4 Commonwealth Court, Brighton,      Massachusetts 02135. Those in the West should still send      their news to Randy Brink, whose (new) address is given at      the bottom of this page.    </p>    <p>      <em>Peace, Cop Macdonald (VE1 BFL)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>99 Fitzroy St.Charlottetown</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Prince Edward Island</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Canada C1A 1R6</em>    </p>    <p>      New Directions Radio is an international network of radio      amateurs concerned with ways of using ham radio (and      related modes of communicating) that promote our growth as      individuals, and which we perceive as helping to create a      more aware, more caring, more responsible human society. We      encourage all who share s these interests to work with us.      A schedule of on-the-air activities is included in each      bimonthly issue of New Directions Roundtable Newsletter      published by Randy Brink (WA7BKR/0) and 80 Bogardus      (W6HSE)as a service to the rest of us.
