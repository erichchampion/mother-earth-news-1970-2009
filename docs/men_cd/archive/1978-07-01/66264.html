                    <p>      <strong>PHOTOGRAPHY: ANOTHER GOOD LITTLE HOMESTEAD      BUSINESS</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by HAM McQUEEN    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      Do you like working with people and animals? Can you      operate a camera well enough to produce top quality      photographs? Do you own or can you get a serviceable 35mm      camera? Would you like to earn as much as $50 ... $100 ...      even $200 or more in a single day? Then become a part-time      Livestock Show photographer!    </p>        <p>      It's Livestock Show time again! From early spring through      late fall hundreds of thousands of 4-H'ers, Future Farmers      of America, and other young herdsmen and -women annually      exhibit their prize animals to judges and appreciative      audiences all across the United States and Canada. And at a      potential profit of $3.00 per animal, those shows can be      worth a considerable chunk of cash to you if you know how      to go about earning it!    </p>    <p>      Try your hand (and camera eye) as a Livestock Show      photographer. That's what I do down here in east Texas, and      I've found my part-time business to be an ideal enterprise      to conduct from a small homestead.    </p>    <h3>      EQUIPMENT    </h3>    <p>      A good 35mm single lens reflex camera outfitted with a      "standard" 55mm lens is the main tool you'll need to set      yourself up in this particular little venture. That, and an      electronic flash or "strobe light". (Stay away from flash      bulbs ... which are a constant expense, require too much      storage space, are a never-ending hassle to handle and      dispose of, and-in general-cause more confusion than      they're worth.    </p>    <h3>      FILM AND PRINTS    </h3>    <p>      Most of the junior showmen and - women (and their parents)      that you'll be working with will want color photographs of      their animals . . . and I've found Vericolor II by Kodak a      very satisfactory film to use. Its colors hold true and its      details-even in 11 X 14 enlargements-remain      very sharp when Vericolor II is processed by a reputable      firm. (I use Kodak for this work because I've learned the      hard way: Owners of championship stock expect better      photographs of their animals than most "quickie, overnight,      cut-rate" processors can deliver.)    </p>    <p>      I offer only two sizes of prints to my customers: 5 X 7 and      8 X 10. You'll be wise to streamline your business the same      way. Take the order when you snap the picture, get the      money for it and the name and address that the print (or      prints) are to be mailed to, and move on to the next      animal. Then-as soon as the enlargements come back      from the processor-deliver or send 'em to the buyers.      In other words, follow the oI KISS formula: Keep It Simple,      Stupid. Your operation will run a lot more easily and      profitably that way.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you want to branch out from the basics, you      can. Newspapers and livestock magazines, for instance, will      often buy black-and-white prints of show winners . . . and      that "extra" money can be tempting. It does, however, mean      another camera (loaded with b and w film) to carry around and      deadlines to meet. And that can complicate your life more      than I want mine complicated. Even if you do decide to      expand your business this way, I'd advise doing so only      after your bread-and-butter color work is smoothed out and      running properly. Take just one step at a time. Remember      KISS.    </p>    <h3>      TRAINING    </h3>    <p>      The "training" you'll need to produce salable livestock      photos is no more complicated than the gear you'll use to      make the shots. It mainly consists of learning how to pose      your subjects . . . and you can pick that up rather quickly      by studying a few livestock "breed" magazines.    </p>    <p>      Note-for instance-that sheep, lambs, and some      horses look better "stretched" ... and are frequently posed      that way. Dairy cattle are generally stretched somewhat too      ... but beef cattle and hogs-which everyone wants to      look "chunky"-never are. (An additional tip: When it      comes to posing a hog, your most valuable tools are      patience and a feed pan.)    </p>    <p>      Once you've gained a feel for the "ground rules" of farm      animal photography, you're well advised to spend a few      afternoons with the area 4-H leader, agriculture teacher,      or county agent. Ask to be shown how livestock are "set up"      in the show ring . . . and pay attention to what you see.      This is the one "trick of the trade" that you're sure to      find most valuable when you start clicking off the "best      possible" pictures of your animal subjects.    </p>    <p>      And last but not least when it comes to the subject of      training: Unless you need technical photographic      information, stay away from professional and newspaper      photographers. I've found that such people usually know      very little about taking pictures of livestock and most      don't even care to learn. (Which is why there's such a big      bushel of opportunities open for      someone-you!-who does want to master the      particulars of this little business.)    </p>    <h3>      THE ADVANCE WORK    </h3>    <p>      Several weeks before any exhibit you intend to cover, check      in with the show superintendents and have your name      officially listed as photographer. You'll find that many of      these shindigs (especially the smaller ones) will have no      one else shooting pictures professionally at all . . . and      you'll be welcomed with open arms.    </p>    <p>      Now's the time, too, to find out whether or not you'll have      an official backdrop to pose livestock against. The "brass"      at most fairs, exhibitions, etc., are only too happy to      provide a drop with the show's name prominently emblazoned      across the top. Just tell whoever is responsible that the      setup should be plain and a medium pastel color (some      breeds of animals do not photograph well against either      white or black).    </p>    <p>      If possible, have this backdrop located very close to the      show ring (sometimes it's even placed inside the ring).      That way, when a winner is selected, its owner can bring it      directly to you for its photograph.    </p>    <h3>      THE ACTION    </h3>    <p>      When a show is in progress, be available. Nothing is more      irritating to an exhibitor than to have to search out the      photographer when it's time to have his or her animal's      picture taken. And-as you'll soon learn-once a      cow, horse, sheep, or whatever has been taken back to its      stall . . . most exhibitors will be reluctant to lead the      animal out again just to take a photo.    </p>    <p>      Then again, don't push your availability too far. If you're      taking pictures inside the judging ring, for example, you      must be absolutely certain that your activities will not      get in the way of any exhibitors or judges and that your      work does not slow down the action in the ring.    </p>    <h3>      DOLLARS AND  cents    </h3>    <p>      Color film costs me about $2.00 per 20-exposure roll and      processing comes to another $7.90. That's $9.90 for 20      shots, or approximately 48 cents each. Add on $1.30 for a 5      X 7 blowup . . . and I have around $1.80 plus tax invested      in each picture. OK. Round that figure off to $2.00 to      cover any miscellaneous expenses and then tack on $3.00 per      5 X 7 print for profit and travel costs.    </p>    <p>      That's how I figure it and that's why I charge $5.00 for      each 5 X 7 color blowup I sell. Black-and-white photos go      for half that amount and I double the $5.00 price for color      8 X 10's. As my costs go up (and I'm sure they will), my      prices will go up too.    </p>    <h3>      IN SUMMARY    </h3>    <p>      After you've shot a few shows (and if your work is any      good), you'll find that your reputation as a livestock      photographer will grow surprisingly fast. And, before you      know it, you'll probably have to start turning down some      fairs, exhibitions, etc., because of conflicting dates. Ah      . . . the price of success!    </p>    <p>      So get out there and work those shows! You have nothing to      lose but a little time and, perhaps, a nice supplemental      income to gain. And one further tip: Don't be afraid to ask      some of the runners-up if they'd like to have their animals      photographed too. Just because an exhibitor didn't win the      first prize in his or her class . . . doesn't mean that a      proud grandma or uncle somewhere won't want a picture of      this Big Moment in that 4H'er or FFA'er's life.    </p>		<hr />
