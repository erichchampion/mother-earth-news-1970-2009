                    <h5 id="byline">      by ROY DYCUS    </h5><hr />    <p>      Early in the spring of 1977 - while experimenting      with various ways to generate methane gas from decaying      organic matter - I made an interesting discovery:      It's possible (and outrageously easy) to produce a very      convincing facsimile of cow manure . . . without a cow.    </p>        <h3>      WONDERFUL . . . BUT WHY?    </h3>    <p>      Now I'm quite aware that this wonderful invention of mine      will probably rank somewhere down around hoof-and-mouth      disease and warble flies with the beef and dairy farmers      out there in MOTHER's vast readership. (Most of the cattle      raisers I know spend more time thinking about how to get      <em>rid</em> of cow manure than they do dreaming up ways to      create it artificially.)    </p>    <p>      Then again, for every <em>one</em> beef or dairy farmer of      my acquaintance . . . I can probably name <em>15</em> or      <em>20</em> urban or suburban gardeners. Each of whom      (unless they've been brainwashed by slick salesmen into      paying even higher prices for chemical plant foods)      regularly shells out several dollars per bag for dried and      ground cow flops . . . which, after all, are <em>only</em>      about the best natural fertilizer that anyone can spread on      a vegetable patch. (Get the picture? Cow manure -      either real or ersatz - is a valuable commodity, and      the price - like all prices - is going up every      day.)    </p>    <h3>      MAKE YER OWN . . . FOR LESS!    </h3>    <p>      The price, that is, continues to escalate <em>if</em>      you're still forced to buy your natural fertilizer      "straight from the cow" . . . a situation that I intend to      rectify right now. Because, as I've learned, it's easier      <em>and far less expensive</em> to recycle leaves, grass,      and other organic material into a cow-manure-like plant      food right in your own back yard by my method . . . than it      is to keep a real cow around to handle the same job for      you.    </p>    <h3>      HOW I DO IT    </h3>    <p>      I stumbled onto my "secret", as I've mentioned, during a      series of methane gas experiments. As you may know, this      fuel (a close relative of natural gas) is produced when      organic waste material of any kind-plant, animal, or      human-is put into a sealed, airless (anaerobic)      container-usually steel or concrete-and allowed      to decompose. Although this process is understood      reasonably well, there is still some controversy (at least      among its grassroots practitioners) about just what organic      waste materials-mixed together in just what      proportions-will produce the optimum amounts of      methane.    </p>    <p>      Which explains why the spring of 1977 found me dumping      various combinations of torn-up weeds, grass clippings,      shredded leaves, comfrey cuttings, chopped kudzu vines,      artichoke and other vegetable clippings, etc., into a      selection of large plastic garbage bags . . . which I then      tied shut and left lying out in the hot sun to "cook".    </p>    <p>      Most of the mixtures of freshly cut organic matter      contained enough natural juice to "heat up" and begin      decomposing "as is". One bag (of grass clippings and      shredded leaves), however, seemed a little too dry to start      this natural action on its own, so I added a half-gallon of      water.    </p>    <p>      I opened the sealed bags (all tagged for reference) every      three days to check on the amount of methane that each      "recipe" was producing. As expected, some formulas created      more gas than others. So far, so good.    </p>    <p>      And then, a few days into the test, I began to notice      something that I hadn't anticipated: The decomposing mass      in most of the black plastic garbage sacks was beginning to      turn into something    </p>    <p>      which strongly resembled horse or cattle manure ...      including a certain amount of their characteristic smells.    </p>    <p>      To be more specific: Nine days after the experiment began,      the contents of the opened bags exhibited a noticeable      "silage" or "pickle acid" odor. One day later a distinct      smell-not bad . . . but unfamiliar, musty, and      vinegary-could be detected a full 50 feet from the      sealed sacks. This aroma then slowly lost its potency as      the various mixtures of decaying matter decomposed. By the      time the test had run 21 to 30 days (depending on the      recipe), all odors-from either the tied or opened      bags-had completely disappeared.    </p>    <p>      At the end of the 21- to 30-day "cooking" period, the      following results were noted: The bag of dry grass      clippings and shredded leaves (which had been wet down      enough to start a decaying action) had turned into a fairly      conventional-looking compost. The sackfuls of naturally      semi-moist organic material, on the other hand, resembled      nothing so much as horse manure . . . and the really juicy      formulations looked more like fresh cow manure than some      real fresh cow manure I've seen!    </p>    <p>      This was so unexpected that I immediately duplicated the      experiment several times . . . always with the same result.      And, although I can't claim that my tests have been      scientifically controlled in any way, I am sure of one      thing: If you shred or chop or grind a mixture of weeds,      grass clippings, comfrey (a member of the borage family      often used for animal forage), kudzu (the fast-growing vine      that has "taken over" parts of the rural South), a few      artichoke plants, and any other naturally juicy "waste"      vegetation you have on hand . . . add extra moisture if      necessary . . . tie it all up in an airtight plastic      garbage bag . . . and leave it lying out in the hot sun for      a month . . . you'll wind up with a dead ringer for what      the cows leave behind in the pasture.    </p>    <h3>      BUT IS IT WORTH IT?    </h3>    <p>      And here's the really good news! My gardening experiments      have convinced me that this artificial cow manure works at      least as well in the vegetable patch as the real thing. In      fact, I think it makes an even richer fertilizer and here's      my reasoning:    </p>    <p>      A cow's digestive system-obviously-is designed      to extract as many nutrients for the cow as possible from      the mass of organic material which passes through it and      eventually is expelled as manure. My plastic bag "digestive      system", by contrast, turns everything that it contains      (except for the few gases which escape) directly into      "manure" . . . with no food values extracted.    </p>    <p>      And here's an added bonus: It's just one whale of a lot      easier to make this artificial manure than it is to produce      ordinary compost!    </p>    <h3>      PROOF OF THE "PUDDING"    </h3>    <p>      Furthermore, I know my ersatz manure can do the job in the      garden. On May 25, 1977-for instance-I dug      holes (four feet apart) for a row of Burpee's Golden      Zucchini squash and a row of Straight Eight cucumbers. One      large shovelful of the fertilizer was thoroughly mixed into      the soil in each excavation and about five seeds were      planted in every hill.    </p>    <p>      Once the seeds had sprouted and the plants were large      enough to mulch, I tilled around them, laid down several      layers of newspaper, and covered the paper with      approximately six inches of hay. And that's about all the      attention the squash and cucumbers got, except for normal      watering.    </p>    <p>      Now I won't say that those plants jumped out of the ground      . . . but they did grow amazingly fast (fast enough to      convince me that no other fertilizer was necessary). Since      this was a test, we held off gathering any of the      burgeoning harvest as long as we could . . . but, by August      10, it was apparent that we'd better start picking the      experimental vines fast while we still had a chance of      keeping,ahead.    </p>    <p>      Squash, squash, squash! I'd never seen anything like those      plants in my garden before. We ate, cooked, dried, canned,      pickled, and gave away (even to the mailman!) more squash      than I'd even guessed one row could produce. l began      telling my wife that the only way to stop those vines from      bearing was to pull them up! We finished the summer feeding      squash to the chickens (the flock loved them).    </p>    <p>      It was the same with the cucumbers. We ate, canned,      pickled, gave away, and filled the refrigerator with cukes.      Finally, in desperation-when the vines had reached      two rows over and started to strangle the sweet      corn-we got out the machete and began chopping them      back. For a while there I felt like a South American      plantation owner fighting against the encroaching jungle.    </p>    <h3>      MORE OF THE SAME    </h3>    <p>      With results like that under my belt, it's easy to see why      I'm putting garbage bag manure on almost my entire garden      this year . . . and, once again, making this fertilizer is      far easier than trying to produce an equivalent amount of      compost: I just use the lawn mower to chop up grass,      leaves, and other organic material . . . mix everything      together . . . dump it into garbage bags . . . and leave      the tied sacks lying out in the sun. There's no      backbreaking turning or lifting or forking or shoveling at      all.    </p>    <h3>      ADDITIONAL TIPS    </h3>    <p>      Although I've talked about tying shut my "airtight" black      plastic bags throughout this article, I do want to point      out that I never completely seal the sacks (if I did,      they'd blow up and burst as the digesting material inside      generates methane gas). I do tie the bags . . . but loosely      enough to allow the forming gas to escape.    </p>    <p>      The importance of moisture and free solar radiation to the      decomposition process outlined here should also be      emphasized. It's the combination of moisture (from either      the natural juices of the vegetation being composted or      added water) plus the heat of the sun that those black bags      soak up plus the almost complete exclusion of outside air      which makes this method work so well. In short, don't      expect to turn out batches of "genuine artificial cow      manure" in 30 days unless you observe this simple ground      rule.    </p>    <p>      And don't waste your time opening all your bags of decaying      matter every three days the way that I did when my original      batch of fertilizer was "cooking". Remember, I was running      a methane experiment the first time that I brewed up      artificial cow flops and I kept peeking in the way I did      just to compare the gas production of one formulation to      another.    </p>    <p>      Forget the methane. Let what little forms bleed off      harmlessly into the atmosphere (the way it bubbles up out      of swamps and escapes from real manure piles and real cows      all the time). Just sack your shredded organic material,      make sure it's moist enough, tie it loosely, throw it out      in the sun, and forget it for 30 days (maybe 35 in some      cases). Then open your goodies and spread'em on the garden.    </p>    <p>      A final tip: This plastic bag fertilizer-once      digested-shares yet another desirable characteristic      with "the real thing". Just like manure straight from the      cow, it can be dried and stored for future use. (Which, of      course, means that it's only a matter of time until someone      starts producing it on a grand scale so he or she can dry      and bag it for sale just like the dried and bagged cow      droppings now available from gardening stores.)    </p>    <h3>      CAN YOU BEAT IT?    </h3>    <p>      So there you have it . . . my latest invention: The      Incredible Roy Dycus Method of Converting Weeds, Kudzu      Vines, Comfrey, Grass Clippings, and Other Juicy Waste      Vegetation Into Cow Manure in the Privacy of Your Own Back      Yard.    </p>    <p>      Sure, you can do the same thing "more naturally" by staking      a real cow out there somewhere on the terrace. But it'll be      messier. And you'll have to feed OI' Bossie all the time,      instead of just when you want some fertilizer. And I don't      think the finished product will be quite as good for your      garden. And besides: A real cow will cost you a couple of      hundred dollars . . . while my black plastic ones set me      back only a few  cents each!    </p>		<hr />
