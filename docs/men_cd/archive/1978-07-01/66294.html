                    <hr />    <p>      Got an ailing rabbit, goose, lamb, goat, pig, or cow that      won't sit still long enough to take its medicine? Don't      give up on the uncooperative critter until you've read what      veterinarian Randy Kidd (of Kansas State University,      Manhattan, Kansas) has to say!    </p>    <p>      One of the most important facets of "animal medicine"-and      one of the first things they teach you in veterinary      school-is restraint: the gentle art of getting your      "patient" (be it a bull or a bantam hen) to stand still      long enough for you to help it . . . or even find out "what      ails the beast".    </p>    <p>      As you already know if you've had any experience with      livestock, it's darn near impossible to inject medication      into a moving target . . . and all too easy to find      yourself in the way of a swiftly moving jaw, hoof, or horn.      It's absolutely essential, thenfor the well-being of both      the animal and its owner-for an "under the weather" critter      to be kept still during treatment.    </p>    <p>      That doesn't mean, however, that a young steer-say-has to      be boxed, tied, and tranquilized before it can be given a      dose of oral vitamins. In general, the best restraint is no      restraint at all. When you can apply treatment to an animal      without tying it down (or doping it up), do so! If-on the      other hand-you must catch and hold the critter, the idea is      to do the job without hurting yourself or the beast. And      that, basically, is what this article is all about.    </p>            <h3>      A WORD OF CAUTION    </h3>    <p>      One thing you should always bear in mind when you're      dealing with an animal that isn't used to being restrained      (and most aren't) is that flight is a beast's first      response to being caught. Even the most docile doe kid goat      can-when she senses she's being trapped-turn into a      thrashing handful of teeth, horns, and hooves. The moral:      Expect the unexpected. Always assume, too, that any      creature which is bigger than you is also much stronge . .      . and act accordingly.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO PICK UP BUNNIES    </h3>    <p>      Rabbits will-on occasion-bite or kick with their front feet      . . . but their best defense (without a doubt) is their      hind legs, which they can use to strike assailants with      amazing speed, force, and rapidity. Here's how to avoid      getting a "swift kick" the next time you have to handle one      of the furry critters:    </p>    <p>      In the case of a small- or mediumsized hare, grab the      animal by the scruff of the neck (NEVER by the ears) with      one hand . . . and slide your other hand under the lower      part of the bunny's curved back. (Do not place your hand or      forearm against the animal's hind feet.) If you're dealing      with a larger rabbit, simply grasp the fold of skin on his      neck with one hand and support his lower back with your      other arm . . . then position the animal so that his head      fits under your arm, his body rests against your hip, and      his "thumping end" is aimed away from you.    </p>    <h3>      FOWL HANDLING TECHNIQUES    </h3>    <p>      Small birds can be held motionless by gently pinning their      wings against their body with your fingers. Your feathered      friend may attempt to peck you, but you'll find that his      beak is pretty ineffective as a defense mechanism.    </p>    <p>      Watch out for geese, however. A goose can very effectively      use the leading edges of its wings as battering rams before      you know what has hit you. (Gus-our goose-caught the bridge      of my nose the other day with amazing accuracy. Only the      dim memory of my street fighting days kept me on my feet!)    </p>    <p>      There is an approved method of counterattack, however: If      treated gently, your honker's neck can be used as a handy      handle. Then, after you nab the bird, pin his wings to his      sides, aim his tail feathers forward, and tuck him under      your arm. (Hint: Your prisoner will be calmer if you can      tuck his head under one wing.)    </p>    <p>      One more thing: Don't forget-when grappling with your      gander-that goose legs are very fragile and easily broken.    </p>    <h3>      SHEEP: OBEDIENT "PATIENTS"    </h3>    <p>      Sheep don't have much of a defense system. Although they      can lower their heads and charge at intruders, they usually      prefer to stamp their little hooves and run away.    </p>    <p>      If you need to, use a small gate to catch the lamb or sheep      you're after in the corner of a pen. Then-without pulling      on the woolplace your hands at the front and rear of the      animal and hold it stationary. (It helps, of course, to      have an assistant.) For foottrimming, shearing, and other      more extensive procedures, you can set the lamb up on its      rump and hold the critter from behind.    </p>    <h3>      HOLD YOUR GOAT STILL    </h3>    <p>      The homestead goat-which is usually friendly to a fault-is      generally fairly easy to restrain. A milking stanchion and      a little grain to nibble on are all most caprines ever      need.    </p>    <p>      Some goats, however-particularly those that aren't      accustomed to peopie-are difficult to catch in their pen.      Here, it's necessary to grab the animal's beard (or the      skin under its chin) as he runs past . . . after which you      can raise his head and hold him against a wall or a fence.      Most goats can be anchored quite easily with this tactic.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes, though, just holding a goat against a wall won't      be enough the beast may still squirm, jump, and fidget so      much that you can't apply the necessary treatment(s). Have      patience . . . because by tying its head securely and then      pressing your head firmly into the animal's flank (thus      pinning him/ her against anything solid), you can work on      injured teats or feet singlehandedly. (It may be necessary,      too, to hold one of the beast's hind legs still.)    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, a little stanchion training prior to a doe's      first milking session is well worth the effort. Start Nanny      about a month before she's due to freshen by feeding her a      small amount of grain in the stanchion during what will      become her normal milking hours. Do nothing else in the      beginning. Then, when the doe has become accustomed to      this, sit beside her while she eats . . . and-as she      relaxes more-start to pet her (all over at first, then      gradually toward her udder). By the time she freshens, you      should be able to milk Nanny with nary a complaint.    </p>    <p>      If you think this is a lot of work . . . just      try-sometime-to strip out a kicking, bucking, squatting,      squirming doe after it's taken you half the morning to get      her into the stanchion in the first place. (Hint: Do not      buy an older doe if you haven't milked her first.)    </p>    <h3>      PIG RESTRAINT    </h3>    <p>      The ever-elusive pig can be as hard to grab as a greased      frisbee. And, in addition to being difficult to hold onto,      these animals can-and, if provoked, sometimes will-inflict      serious wounds with their needle-like teeth. Hence, if you      plan to have many oinkers around, a good holding crate with      a head gate is an absolute necessity. (The occasional      errant hog can be held in a corner with a strong portable      gate of about the same length and height as the pig.)    </p>    <p>      Oftentimes a large hog will hold still if you can slip a      noose over his snout behind the top tusks. To make a hog      noose, securely fasten a section of rope or cable to one      end of a several-foot-long piece of pipe, then feed the      free end of the rope (or cable) back through the tubing and      fasten a "crosswise" handle to the cable after you've      pulled it out of the pipe's other end. Now just throw the      loopedback rope over the porker's snout and-by pulling on      the handlecinch the loop tight on the beast's nose. (The      hog will normally try to back away from the holder, so      hrace yourself.) Pull the lope s free end snug, and hold      your ground.    </p>    <p>      The best way to handle smaller porkers is to grab their      hind legs (above the hocks) and lift them off the ground      (see photo). Don't attempt this, however, if the piglet's      mama is within earshot. The mother sow will respond quickly      and aggressively to any squeals from any one of her babies.    </p>    <p>      For prolonged procedures, you can hold the pig's hind legs      up with the animal's body aimed rearward while you stand      straddling him. If need be, you can further stabilize the      young'un by anchoring him with your knees.    </p>    <h3>      IMMOBILIZING CATTLE    </h3>    <p>      The only effective (and safe) way to restrain a hoofer ten      times your size is to drive the beast into a narrow (say      26" to 28" wide) chute made of hardwood or iron. (Pine      two-by-fours are no better than balsa wood when dealing      with an angry cow or bull.) Use bolts or strong welds to      hold the chute's members together, and make sure you've      left no sharp corners on either the inside or the outside      of the enclosure.    </p>    <p>      Next-working from behind the steer, bull, or whatever-use      poles pushed crossways through the frame just behind him to      keep the brute facing forward, and-once he's all the way in      the chute-catch his head with a sturdy stanchion. (Dairy      cows are best worked on when shut into their usual      stanchion.)    </p>    <p>      To restrain of Bessie's head, you can buy or make a rope      halter . . . or you can try using a bull lead (a      pliers-like tool that is clamped into the animal's nose).      Once the lead is in place, you can pull the beast's head as      far through the stanchion as possible and over to one side,      then tie her in place. (The first time I used one of these      gadgets, 1 didn't have the cow's head pulled tightly      enough. As a result, the animal flipped her head up,      tossing the nose lead out of her snout and into the air.      After the several necessary stitches, my head healed just      fine, thank you.)    </p>    <p>      When you've secured your cow's head, you're halfway home .      . . now all you have to worry about are those powerful back      legs. To throw Bessie's hind end into neutral, grab the      base of her tail from underneath (just ignore the smelly      green stuff) and thrust it straight up. This'll put      pressure on her nerves and make it more difficult (though      not at all impossible) for her to kick. (Do apply a lot of      upward pressure, though, and do stand well to one side . .      . just in case your 1,500-pound lovely is not fully in      neutral.)    </p>    <p>      Sometimes-in addition to the foregoingit's a good idea to      tie a rope into a loose figure eight above the beast's      hocks to keep her from kicking. Do not tie the rope to      anything solid, however . . . you don't want Bessie to fall      and break her legs when she tries to move. Have someone      keep some tension on the line, though, to prevent      unnecessary kicking and stomping.    </p>    <h3>      DO NO HARM    </h3>    <p>      Remember-whenever you find yourself trying to still a      feisty critter-that the first rule in veterinary medicine      (as in people medicine) is: Do no harm. If you find that      you must restrain an animal, do it in such a way that you      hurt neither yourself nor the beast.    </p>    <p>      And that's just about all I can tell you (in this limited      amount of space, anyway) about animal restraint . . .      except that "when in doubt, consult your veterinarian".    </p>    <hr />
