        <p>PORTABLE PRESSURE TANK<br />Here's a portable pressure tank, or air bottle, (See Image Gallery above)Â that you'll find handy whenever you need to carry pressurized air "out beyond the powerlines" somewhere.<br />Just get a short length of air hose with a 114" female flare fitting on one end and a tire chuck on the other and screw the female fitting onto a recycled Freon cylinder's top valve. Then buy an all-metal Schrader valve (the size of its "base" doesn't matter), drill a hole in the pressure tank to fit, and securely silver-solder the Schrader fitting into the opening. (NOTE: You must remove the hardware inside the valve before doing this soldering and then replace it alter the soldering is completed.)<br />All right! You've just built yourself a pressure bottle. Add air through the Schrader valve (and check the pressure in the container with a tire gauge applied to this valve), carry the tank anywhere you like . . . and then use the air hose to "pump up" wagon tires or do other light jobs down in the back 40, on remote roads, etc. Simple isn't it?</p>
