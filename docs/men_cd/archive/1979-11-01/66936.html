                <p>      <strong><em>You can save 12% on your annual heating      bill-and still wake up to a warm house-with      MOTHER'S $21.41 ...</em></strong>    </p>            <p>      On these long and frigid winter evenings, many sleepers      enjoy the economy (and comfort!) of clicking their      thermostats back to 60°F (or lower) and snuggling deep      beneath an extra blanket or quilt. The cool night air      against one's face-contrasted with the envelope of      warmth provided by the additional bedclothes-seems to      bring on the sleep of the guiltless (well, at least the      "slumber of the thrifty").    </p>    <p>      But oh! those first few dripping-wet steps out of the next      morning's shower (and <em>into</em> 60°F air) can be a      rude shock. Until now the only way around the a.m. goose      bumps-short of an energy-eating space      heater-has been either to rise at 4:00 a.m. and kick      the thermostat back up, or to purchase a $45 to $90      electronic setback control. MOTHER'S technicians (as well      as a number of our readers) weren't satisfied with either      one of these approaches ... so they've developed a      simpler-and less expensive-way to achieve the      same results as are possible with the <em>store-bought</em>      setbacks.    </p>    <p>      Instead of controlling one thermostat with a timer,      MOTHER'S researchers took a tip from reader Thorn Daoust      and designed a unit that uses two thermostats . . . and a      timer to control an electromagnetic switch called a relay.      When the relay gets power-by way of the 115V wires      from the plug-in timer-it switches the 24V thermostat      current to the <em>auxiliary</em> furnace regulator . . .      but when the timer kicks back <em>off</em> (in the morning)      the temperature control reverts to the main unit. There are      eight posts on a DPDT (dual pole dual throw) relay: two for      the 115V household line from the timer (Nos. 2 and 7), two      for the 24V wires from the furnace (Nos. 1 and 8), and two      more for each thermostat (Nos. 3 and 6 ... Nos. 4 and 5).    </p>    <p>      And for those occasions when you want to stay up a little      later than usual-and thus want the house to stay warm      for an hour or so more-a manual override switch is      helpful. Your timer may already be equipped with such a      feature . . . but if not, just wire a toggle switch into      one of the 115V lines. (If you include a pilot light in      this circuit loop, you'll be able to tell at a glance      whether you're on the auxiliary thermostat or not.)    </p>    <p>      As you can see, there's next to nothing involved in      building this thermostat control. A couple of off-the-shelf      parts and a little wire and solder are all that go into it.      In fact, the only thing about MOTHER'S setback thermostat      that takes less effort than building the device is using      it.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Thermostats do differ in their      specifications. In particular, electric baseboard controls      often operate on 115V current and can be wired directly to      a timer of suitable load capability. Also, when you      purchase an auxiliary thermostat, check to be sure that the      unit has a load rating similar to that of your main      controller.</em>    </p>
