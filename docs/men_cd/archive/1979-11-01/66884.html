        <hr /><p>Where did MOTHER go to run airplanes on homemade alcohol? Why, to this year's Experimental Aircraft Association's gathering in... OSHKOSH BY GOSH!</p><p>The Experimental Aircraft Association's Fly-In-held this year (as it has been for nearly a decade) at Oshkosh, Wisconsin's Wittman Field airport- is the world's largest aviation event, bar none!</p><p>During the Fly-in's unbroken history(the EAA has held the annual shindig-at various locations-every year since 1953) the gathering has grown from the small group of 40 aircraft that assembled for the first event to a total of 1,492 in 1978. And this year's meet boasted an even greater number of planes ... as well as half a million experimental-aircraft enthusiasts!</p><p>It's no wonder, then (considering both the size of the event and the fact that EAA folks are, themselves, pretty good examples of MOTHER-type "do-it-yourselfers"), that this magazine was pleased to be invited to the Flyin, And we were especially glad to be offered a chance to convert Experimental Aircraft Association president Paul Poberezny's Volkswagen-engined "Pober Pixie" airplane, his "Red One" VW staff car, and a "Pterodactyl" microlight aircraft to run on our own alcohol fuel! (See the story on page 48 of this issue.)</p><p>Paul was right pleased with the way ethatnol powered the vehicles, too. In fact, he became eager to promote the use of renewable fuel himself ... and-since he's only the "chief" of the world's most famous aviation association-he ought to know what he's talking about when he says that ol' MOM is really onto something!</p><hr /><p>EDITOR'S NOTE: A one-year EAA membership-including 12 issues of the group's magazine, Sport Aviation-can he hod for $25 front EAA, Dept. TMEN, Box 229, Hale's Corners, Wisconsin 53130.</p>
