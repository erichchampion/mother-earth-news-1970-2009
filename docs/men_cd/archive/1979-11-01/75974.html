                    <hr />    <p>      For the past several years, the good folks at the Institute      for Local Self-Reliance in Washington, D.C. have worked to      help urban residents gain greater control over their lives      through the use of low-technology, decentralist tools and      concepts. We strongly believe that more people (city      dwellers and country folk alike) should be exposed to the      Institute's admirable efforts... which is why we've made      this "what's happening where" report by ILSR staffers one      of MOTHER'S regular features.<br />      <br />      Raising fish in the basement-as a means of producing      a home supply of inexpensive protein-is an enticing      idea to urban and rural dwellers alike... especially now      that overfishing (coupled with the pollution of many      spawning and feeding areas) has led to higher seafood      prices.    </p>    <p>      Fish <em>can</em> , of course, be grown in basements (as      Dr. Fernwood Mitchell proved when he raised rainbow trout      in his Washington, D.C. cellar). Such closed systems,      however, require perpetual filtering and aeration of the      water, constant temperature control, and regular      supplemental feedings... and they'll only be worthwhile      when transportation expenses become so high that basement      growing, with all of <em>its</em> costs, becomes      economically competitive with our present commercial      fisheries.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, not <em>all</em> aquaculture is as      intensive and financially prohibitive as are basement      systems. <em>Ocean ranching</em> is a good example of the      other "fin farming" extreme. Salmon hatcheries on our      northeastern and northwestern coasts release millions of      juveniles each year... fish that are subsequently harvested      by both commercial boats <em>and</em> sports anglers. (The      Lummi Indians of Bellingham, Washington-who use their      trout and salmon hatcheries as a spur to encourage      community economic development-produce nearly five      <em>million</em> fingerlings a year.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, there's an extension of ocean ranching-a      system that's appropriate for a wider variety of      species-in which the juveniles are released into a      partially <em>enclosed</em> environment... one that can      receive <em>some</em> management. Known as <em>parc      culture</em> , this system was initially developed to grow      oysters in Brittany's tidal flats, but is now being used in      many American shellfish beds. And-for more      <em>mobile</em> forms of marine life-gates can be      used to retain the finned groups in the "cropped" bay,      tidal flat, or whatever.    </p>    <p>      <em>Raft culture</em> provides still another fish farming      alternative. By growing mussel colonies on rafts anchored      in the middle of an unpolluted estuary, Ed Meyers of      Damariscotta, Maine is able to raise the shellfish for less      than 20 cents a pound!    </p>    <p>      <em>Cage culture</em> is an even more intensive method: The      cultured organisms are enclosed in either plastic mesh or      bamboo cages which are, in turn, secured in a large natural      body of water.<br />      However, it's <em>pond systems</em> that have      been-and still are-the basic aquacultural unit      throughout the world... ranging from Africa's tilapia/carp      polyculture to the rather intensive catfish farming of      North America. This type of aquaculture-which is      midway between extensive and intensive farming-is      likely to remain the most widely used system, because it      incorporates some of the advantages of each extreme.    </p>    <p>      On the one hand, the pond provides a controlled growing      environment from which fish can easily be harvested,      while-on the other hand-such "open air      aquariums" are <em>also</em> able to benefit from inlets      and outlets that flush fish wastes... from sunlight which      aids in the growing of food... and from the natural      aeration and circulation of water by wind.    </p>    <p>      It's premature, of course, to evaluate aquaculture's      potential as a community food or income source in either      rural or urban areas, since many of the possibly useful      systems are still in the developmental stages. However,      fish farmers in the U.S. are beginning to realize that they      can increase their yields dramatically by adopting the      <em>Asian</em> polycultural practice of growing      combinations of ecologically compatible species in the same      water... rather than limiting production to one variety of      fish per pond, as has been the American tradition.    </p>    <p>      As for seafood farming in the city... neither closed,      intensive systems (such as basement aquaculture) nor      extensive techniques are appropriate for urban fish      production. Intensive systems have very high start-up      costs, require a great deal of energy for operation, and      produce expensive products. On the other hand, although      <em>extensive</em> aquaculture systems make sense from an      energy usage perspective, most cities use their natural      tidal and river resources to dilute a heavy output of      sewage, industrial waste, and runoff pollution... so such      bodies of water would require massive purification      facilities before they could be successfully (and safely!)      farmed.    </p>    <p>      Ponds are, therefore, the best hope for city fish farming.      Such small "lakes" can take advantage of the energy      available from solar radiation... the higher temperatures      of the urban environment... and, perhaps, even wind power      to provide water circulation.    </p>    <p>      While fallout from air pollution or runoff from streets and      pesticide-treated areas may present problems to the city      aquacul-turist, his or her <em>largest</em> challenge will      be to develop this medium-intensity system to the point      where it can have a significant impact on neighborhood      protein production. Advertising will likely be needed to      build consumer acceptance of products like mussels and      catfish... and energy-efficient filtration and aeration      systems must be developed so that stocking densities can be      increased.    </p>    <p>      Once such "barriers" are crossed, however, the dream of the      backyard urban fishpond-next to the vegetable garden      and supplied by a neighborhood hatchery-can become      far more than just a fantasy.    </p>    <p>      <em>You can have a free catalog of ILSR's selection of      books and pamphlets by sending the Institute a      self-addressed, stamped envelope.
