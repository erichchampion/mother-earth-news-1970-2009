                <p>      <strong><em>Living in an urban trailer court didn't stop      Jay Williams from working toward self-sufficiency, because      he made up his mind to</em></strong> <strong><em>. .      .</em></strong>    </p>                <p>      Do you get pangs of jealousy whenever you read articles      about folks who're raising, eating, and putting up their      own vegetables . . . while the only thing you're growing is      another day older? Do you dream of warming your hands      beside a wood stove . . . every time you turn up the      furnace thermostat?    </p>    <p>      Can you tell your friends all the ins and outs of solar      collectors . . . but find no time or space to build your      sun-catcher? And are you piggy-banking funds for your very      own back forty . . . while you wonder if you'll ever be      able to afford a front "one or two"?    </p>    <p>      Well Bunky, perhaps you should quit making excuses and      start building that new life right where you are! I'm not      just spitting into the wind, either, 'cause I know-from my      own experience-that it can be done! You see, my lady friend      and I grow and put up veggies, raise and eat small      livestock, and heat our home with wood and our water with      sunshine . . . yet we live in a 100-unit trailer court      that's smack in the middle of an 85,000 person metropolis!    </p>    <h3>      BACK TO THE CITY    </h3>    <p>      My "citysteading" success story began when I abandoned life      as a smog-breathing, money-grubbing Los Angeleno and headed      out for some longed-for rural living in the Trinity Alps of      northern California. Unfortunately, after nine months of      hard knocks in the sticks, I realized that-though I had the      necessary enthusiasm-I sorely lacked homesteadin'      knowledge. I just wasn't ready to live in the country yet.    </p>    <p>      Still, I didn't like the thought of facing the L.A.      treadmill again, so I migrated to a friend's town: Sioux      City, Iowa. And there-in the aforementioned trailer court-I      hooked up with a fine young woman named Angela and her      four-year-old son, Terence. Unfortunately, the funds we      pooled that autumn were "minute" (hers), "minuter" (mine),      and "minutest" (Terence's). So-like it or not-we were      pretty much forced to adopt some homesteading-type steps      toward independence.    </p>    <p>      Angie and I began our move toward self-sufficiency by      scouring back issues of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) (I'd      introduced her to my collection back when we started      sparkin' ). And the articles in dear of MOTHER convinced us      that our initial moneysaving step should be to cut down on      what would surely be some humongous winter heating bills.      And thus-into our chilly "home, mobile home"-entered . . .    </p>    <h3>      THE WOOD STOVE    </h3>    <p>      I dug my 1895 cast-iron wood-burner out of storage (I had      practically abandoned the "worthless" old relic) and      installed it according to the local safety regulations for      trailers. That operation was easy enough, and-before      long-we were all set for snow season . . . except for one      little thing: wood. Here it was fall already, and we had no      chain saw or available firewood! But-not a whit      deterred-Angie and I solved that problem by "citifying" a      time-honored country custom: barter. I merely called local      tree removal businesses until I found one that was willing      to deliver loads of dry wood to our mobile domicile. You      see, those urban wood-chopping folk often have to pay a      trash yard for the privilege of dumping their timber      trimmin's. So I saved them money, and they gave me wood. A      nice trade, no?    </p>    <p>      The swap was so successful, in fact, that in only one      week-I "gathered" four LARGE loads of elm. The hardwood      chunks were far from stove size, however, so I found a      friend with a chain saw and swapped his assistance for a      share of the cuttin's. After two days of hard work, we both      had plenty of firewood for the winter.    </p>    <p>      And a snug season we had, too! Angie and I had installed      the antique wood-burning heater in the north end of our      trailer, so-with the help of the prevailing north wind and      a small, air-circulating floor fan-the warmth from that      toaster spread pretty much all the way down our      long-but-lean home. (Well . . . I have to admit there was      one night-when the wind-chill factor dropped the      temperature to the equivalent of -70Â°F-that the whole      family slept right next to the stove!)    </p>    <p>      Of course, any wood-burner accumulates lots of ashes.      But-as it turned out-staring at three big trash bags' worth      of those flaky leftovers prodded us on to our next stage of      citysteading. You see, when I said, "There must be      something we can do with all these ashes," Angie replied,      "Gee, I read an article in MOTHER that said we could use      'em on a garden," and that led to . . .    </p>    <h3>      THE VEGETABLE PATCH    </h3>    <p>      Now planning a garden might not seem like a very original      thought, but you have to remember that we were living in a      stark urban trailer court. And when I say stark, I mean      STARK. The bulldozers that "terraced" the land for our      mobile community had removed all the usable soil and left      the entire area topped by that scourge of the Missouri      Valley . . . gumbo.    </p>    <p>      For those of you who have never had the honor, allow me to      introduce said scourge (as politely as I can manage). Gumbo      is a clay ground (you wouldn't call it soil) which-when      wet-gets so slick that a full-loaded pickup truck running      snow tires and chains will get stuck on a two-percent      downhill grade! On the other hand, the substance becomes so      bricklike when it's dry that you could sharpen a knife on      it . . . and the local moles all have to move into trees!      In fact, the only plants that can grow in this life-denying      medium are the hardiest of weeds.    </p>    <p>      As you can imagine, when we bragged to our neighbors on how      we figured to raise a deluxe vegetable patch in our gumbo      "yard", folks laughed so hard our whole trailer shook. But      Angie and I just ignored 'em and stuck our noses back in      the books. We studied our issues of MOM-as well as every      other how-to-garden tome we could get our hands on-then we      picked out our croppin' spot, "sowed" the stove ashes,      began "brewing" compost (in plastic trash cans so the local      canines couldn't get to it), and ordered seed catalogs.    </p>    <p>      When the winter broke, we plopped our compost on the garden      (along with a free load of manure from a local stockyard)      and then-with difficulty-hand-spaded our 12' X 25'      vegetable heaven. We next rented a rototiller (we'd both      finally landed secure jobs so we had a little money) and      found that-surprise our compost and manure treatments had      made the ground downright tillable. After that, we parted      with even more money and bought some posts and fencing to      keep out the dogs, cats, and-most especially-the      "mini-people".    </p>    <p>      A brief aside here about those last mentioned banes of the      urban gardener: Mini-people (sometimes called "kids" by      townsfolk who forget how that particular moniker's meant to      refer to young goats) may be lovable tykes, but let's face      it-children can pull vegetable raids that'd put a herd of      wild woodchucks to shame! Angie and I decided to protect      our plantings with a natural "finger blight" deterrent . .      . namely, the sacrificial offering. We raised cherry      tomatoes along all our fencing, and let it be known that      any ripe little "toe-me-toes" were free for the grabbin'.      And our "natural pest control" worked . . . the youngsters      were content with their one-bite treats and stayed away      from our more adult-sized vegetables.    </p>    <p>      And now, back to the story.    </p>    <p>      By this time, Angie and I were both eager to get our crops      growing. But all the local back porch experts kept saying,      "Don't plant now. We've got at least one hard frost-maybe      even snow-acomin'." This being our first on-our-own garden      and all, we were naturally a little shy about going against      such advice . . . so we didn't get our seeds in the ground      until five days before summer!    </p>    <p>      And I guess I might as well tell you now that the end      result of all the caring labor we put in during the next      three months wouldn't exactly have stocked a frontier      family's winter pantry. You see, the late planting ruined      our chances for eggplant, lettuce, and watermelon crops . .      . then a Midwest-wide plague of grasshoppers chewed up most      of our carrots, beets, peas, and snap beans. Still, we did      gain a respectable samplin' of eats (plus a whole lot of      growing experience) and on top of that-reaped a surprise      "bonus" crop of volunteer tomatoes that sprouted up from      our compost leavings. So I'd have to say we garnered a      "right fair" first harvest. We even gleaned enough pickin's      so we could try our hands at that time-honored      urbansteader's chore . . .    </p>    <h3>      PUTTING UP THE VEGETABLES    </h3>    <p>      Now I confess that neither one of us back-to-the-cityites      had very much food-preserving background, but-as you've      probably figured out by now-we never let a lack of      experience keep us from tackling any chore. Even the fact      that Angie had obtained a night-shift job (while I labored      during the day) didn't slow us down. We just worked out a      separate-but-equal canning assembly line!    </p>    <p>      I'd come home in the evening and pick, wash, and stack the      day's ripe produce. The following morning (while I was at      work), Angie'd gather up books, jars, canning gear, worry      beads, the phone (to call friends for advice) and . . .      (gulp!) . . . can! The next day, Ang'd do the picking,      washing, and stacking. Then-when I got home-I'd grab the      books, phone, canner, and worry beads . . . and take my      chances.    </p>    <p>      When we finally saw each other-on weekends-all we could      talk about was, "Where did you get that idea?", "Wow, did      you write that down?", and "Oh! So that's the way you're      supposed to do it! "    </p>    <p>      The total result of our split-shift enterprise included      over 44 quarts of canned and pickled tomatoes (those      "bonus" volunteers turned out to be small, hard-skinned      tomato mutants that took days to peel), 3 quarts each of      zucchini pickles, a zesty zuke-onion-tomato mix, cucumber      pickles, and snap beans (if you ever want to grow a treat      for your neighborhood's grasshoppers, try snap beans) . . .      as well as 2 pints of pickled beets. Don't laugh at those      meager-sounding amounts, either, because the experience      taught us how to handle the particular quirks of each of      our food products (and we didn't lose one jar to spoilage      all winter! ) . . . plus, we sure enjoyed eating our      stored-up harvest.    </p>    <p>      In fact, we had an especially wonderful Thanksgiving that      fall because-on that blessed day-we opened our first      homestored foodstuffs. Terence, Angie, and I sat down to      tasty vegetables from our garden, bread and pies from our      oven, heat from our wood stove, and that savory duck from      our . . . . Oh my gosh! I forgot to tell you about . . .    </p>    <h3>      THE DUCKS    </h3>    <p>      Actually, it's probably just as well that I didn't mention      the ducks before. Maybe if I take each of our projects to      completion before telling you about the next one, you (and      I) won't get too confused.    </p>    <p>      Our venture into citystead duck raising had started-way      back 'round Easter -when young Terence received a little      yellow ball of quacking fluff. Since that spring's weather      was pretty darn brisk, the persistent honker had to live      indoors. At that point three people-and one large,      half-wild tomcat-had to share their already crowded home      with a noisy little box wetter (named Peeper) . . . and      believe me, that's no way to live in a trailer.    </p>    <p>      Angie and I had already decided that we would expand our      garden next year (which-since we hadn't even planted the      first plot yet-showed no little confidence), so we decided      to build an outdoor duck pen at the to-be-enlarged end of      our veggie patch . . . and let Peeper help "build" the      soil. Then, seeing as how of Peep was for petting-not for      eating (the bird did belong to Terence, after all)-we      bought ourselves five more "dining" ducks.    </p>    <p>      We put all six waterfowl in a      large-Board-of-Health-approved-homemade pen and covered the      top of the cage with chicken wire to keep out the dogs and      mini-people. Unfortunately, though, the local youngsters      couldn't resist the impulse to come and "play" with our      birds when no one was around . . . so we eventually lost      two ducks to mishandling and two more to dogs (when the      little visitors left the gate- open). Still, two female      birds made it through the summer, so we were able to spare      one duck for Thanksgiving dinner. And let me tell you, that      waterfowl was the best eatin' I ever had. Except, perhaps,      for the rabbit. Yep, I did it to you again. Now it's time      to tell you about . . .    </p>    <h3>      THE RABBITS    </h3>    <p>      Once again I'll have to backtrack to begin this tale      and-also once again-it was an Easter present to Terence      that started the whole thing. This time, the boy received a      female (Giant Silver Champagne) fur bearer ... of Bad Habit      rabbit.    </p>    <p>      I figured that-using Bad Habit as a breeder-we could soon      raise zillions of fluffy dinner bunnies by simply building      a hutch, locating a male "stud" rabbit, and then honin' up      the cutlery. Unfortunately, I read about hutch building      before I read about rabbit raising. So I built a fine,      large cage and then learned that the proper breeding season      for bunnies wouldn't come around until the following      winter! There was nothing to do but buy another female to      raise for the current season's dinner table and try to keep      Bad Habit-the starter rabbit-out of trouble until the next      year. At least the new bunny (who met her demise via the      rabbit-butchering instructions in MOM's Issue No. 15, pages      18-23) did make for some mighty fine eating.    </p>    <h3>      MORE DOWNTOWN CITY LORE    </h3>    <p>      Besides wood heating, gardening, canning, and duck and      rabbit raising, Angie and I found several other ways to      further our self-sufficiency campaign. For one thing, I      scrounged up an old refrigerator and constructed a      single-loop passive hot water system (from the plans on      page 108 in MOTHER NO. 48, of course) that supplied all our      household's water heating needs. (I had to store the device      when winter came on, but plan to have MOM NO. 49's      freezeproof double-loop heater built by next year . . .      complete with a solar-tracker!)    </p>    <p>      We also-like true-blue citysteaders-employed ye of barter      principle whenever possible. For instance, I lent my .22      rifle to a weaponless hunting friend and was rewarded with      half the game he shot. I also traded extra garden produce      for other goods we needed, and hooked into a local food      co-op to swap my work time for discounts on quality,      affordable foodstuffs.    </p>    <p>      All in all, Angie and I not only proved that you can employ      a lot of so-called "country" skills in the midst of Urbania      . . . we also realized a considerable saving on our heating      and feeding bills and got to enjoy some darn good homegrown      victuals in the bargain. And, if you think we've done      pretty well so far, just wait till next year . . . because      I tell you, the two of us have got some BIG plans for the      future.    </p>    <p>      So friends, if you're nesting in an urban area, don't sit      on your duff thinking that the good MOTHER-type lifestyle      belongs only to those rustics livin' way out in      Sticksville. No sirree bob, the good life comes to those      who make the good life, no matter where they've pitched      camp. My advice to you is to begin taking more control of      your life. Get a move on . . . and pronto: After all, if      you plan to become successful citysteaders-as we have-you'd      better get started.    </p>    <p>      You're already one year behind us.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The back issues of this publication      mentioned in the above article are available-for $3.00      apiece plus $1.00 shipping and handling per order-from THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O.
