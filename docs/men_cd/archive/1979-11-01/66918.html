                <p>      <em>Devon Tassen's interest in alternative forms of energy      took a practical and beautiful form when he decided to      ...</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By DOUG KOON    </h5>    <hr />        <p>      The small town of Millville, California-located about      12 miles east of Redding-is downright "rooster" proud      of this beautiful new "windplant house" . . . which was      designed, built, and is being lived in by the village's      volunteer fire chief, Devon Tassen.    </p>    <p>      Tassen (who has followed developments in wind, water, and      solar power for years) admits that a small hydroplant would      have been his first choice for a personal source of      electricity. Unfortunately, streams and rivers are in short      supply in the Millville area. So, in 1973, the fire chief      looked to the sky and began to design a home-in the      old "Dutch Windmill" tradition-that would incorporate      modern aerodynamic principles.    </p>    <p>      It took the amateur architect over a year to plan his      dwelling, and he finally began construction in September of      1974. The house, which is now completed, became a      five-story structure with a total of 1,300 square feet of      floor area.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the tall and narrow layout of Devon's home has      necessitated some rather unusual use of that space.    </p>        <p>      Each story, in effect, serves one purpose. The ground level      is the living room, the second floor houses a bedroom,      bath, and utility closet . . . and so on. However, the real      "heart" of the wind-powered home is the fifth level turret      room, which contains a 1,800-pound, 40-kilowatt synchronous      generator <em>and</em> the automatic system that Tassen      designed to turn the turret itself ... in order to keep the      giant blades facing into the wind.    </p>    <p>      Devon's generator is actually capable of producing 300      horsepower in a 40-mile-perhour gale, but a seven-or      eight-MPH breeze is sufficient to generate all the power      the family requires.    </p>    <p>      The fire chief finished his house in the summer of 1976,      and-so far-the remarkable home powerplant has      "worked just fine, thank you". And the cost of the project      (excluding that of the house itself) was kept to $8,000      through the use of many recycled parts and materials. Of      course, it won't take long for the system to pay for itself      either . . . now that Tassen's electric bills are ''gone      with the wind"!    </p>
