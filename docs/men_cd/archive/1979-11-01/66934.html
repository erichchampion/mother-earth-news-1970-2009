    <p>
                <p>      <em>As former beef rancher Don Wright discovered, there's      more than one way to make a farm pay!</em>    </p>            <p>      Way back in 1971 (when MOTHER was still a mere girl), our      family escaped the clutches of city pollution in all its      varied forms and fell in love with the scrubbed-clean air      of rural Haliburton County, Ontario.    </p>    <p>      For us (my wife Mary, sons Dave and Mike, and daughters      Dawn-Liane and Karen) time really began that year, as we      happily took up the chores and routines of caring for our      chickens, a gelding, a Jersey cow, and a pair of      Yorkshire-Hampshire sows and their piglets. However, our      cash crop was cattle, and-by the fall of      1976-we had increased our herd to 20 head.      Then-to our dismay-beef prices plummeted ...      expenses soared. . . and our spirits sagged.    </p>    <p>      What to do? Sell out, of course: A two-year-old steer      simply won't wait for market prices to improve. Instead,      his appetite for hay and grain marches onward ... to the      tune of big-dollar feed bills and small weight gains.      Nevertheless, it's just about impossible to tend living      creatures without becoming attached to 'em, and we watched      the cattle buyer's departure with a numbing sense of guilt,      shock, and dismay . . . but-as happens to many other      folks who strive to live independently in a natural      setting-circumstances (in our case the dropping beef      prices) demanded that we "buck up" and reconsider the uses      we'd been making of our resources.    </p>    <h3>      A CAREFUL SWITCH-OVER    </h3>    <p>      It was then that we decided to convert our sturdy, empty      barn (45' X 51') to house a new lumber milling operation.      It would have cost $25,000 to $30,000 to erect a comparable      structure . . . but the conversion-which involved      removing the hay and stabling pens, installing additional      posts for support, and thickening the upper floor with      two-inch tamarack lumber sheathing-only required      about 70 man-hours of labor.    </p>    <p>      Before rushing into the venture, however, we consulted the      zoning bylaws to make certain the regulations that covered      our land and buildings would permit the establishment of a      lumber processing business. Much to our delight, the local      council gave us consent in writing. Equally important,      however, was the verbal approval we sought from our nearest      neighbors. When a green-light situation seemed to prevail      at every turn, we felt encouraged enough to go shopping for      machinery.    </p>    <p>      Since labor costs had been a major factor contributing to      the demise of many medium-to-small (eight to ten workers)      mills, we reasoned that-despite the considerable      expense of occasional equipment repairs-a small      family operation that used <em>large-scale</em> machinery      and had a good location would always have enough work to      keep busy . . . and <em>should</em> manage a reasonable      return on the investment.    </p>    <p>      As it turned out, we were able-by      word-of-mouth-to locate all the necessary equipment .      . . within a 20-mile radius of our home <em>and</em> at      good prices! We obtained, for example, a fairly full and      compatible milling setup that was <em>underused</em> by a      firm which had shifted its operation to retailing. The      $5,000 price tag covered the power unit (a UD-14      International Diesel), planing mill, resaw mill, ripping      mill, and a complete line of accessories . . . including      knives, band and rip saws, a line shaft, bearing mounts,      belts, pulleys, a blower, a belting and lacing tool, small      motors and grinders, exhaust piping, etc.    </p>    <p>      Further inquiries led us to a bargain forklift ($2,500) and      gravel truck ($1,500), the latter of which we lengthened to      accommodate loads of long lumber. Our mill equipment cost      us a grand total of $9,000.    </p>    <h3>      SWEET SUCCESS    </h3>    <p>      Of course, even after we'd cleaned out the barn and      purchased the necessary machinery, a fair amount of work      remained before we could open for business. For example,      since the planer mill was extremely heavy (an estimated 12      tons), the barn floor had to be braced with a row of      additional support posts. And-prior to unloading any      heavy equipment-we had to take great care to decide      the best traffic pattern for material handling within the      limitations of the existing structure.    </p>    <p>      Using pipe, rollers, jacks, chains, and a "puller", we      installed the machines. During the following weeks, the      line shaft was leveled and lagged down . . . pulleys were      lined "plumb" and true to the shaft . . . and protective      railings were placed in potentially dangerous locations.      The exhaust piping (12" diameter) and blower were connected      to all three mills and vented to the field at the northeast      corner of the barn.    </p>    <p>      Then, once again, we discovered that word-of-mouth      recommendations are indeed powerful . . .      because-even before the machines were in      operation-the phone started ringing with requests for      custom planing and resawing. Though many of these early      orders were fairly small (often under 1,000 board feet),      one person usually referred another to us ... and customers      who came for one item often purchased much more than they'd      planned to.    </p>    <p>      In fact, the need for our service was so strong that our      10,000 board feet of white pine, spruce, and eastern cedar      (which we'd purchased in the rough for resale) wasn't even      <em>processed</em> until well on in the season.    </p>    <p>      Better yet, dollars and <em>busy</em> -ness aside, we found      that we <em>enjoyed</em> dealing with our customers. The      do-it-yourself types who come to the "farm" (we still think      of it that way) are, without exception, interesting people.      Every one of them has plans for his or her material: studs,      joists, rafters, sheathing, floors, wall paneling, siding,      cabinets, furniture . . . the list is nearly endless. Some      folks come simply to haul away the clean planer shavings      for pet and livestock bedding . . . and every person is a      pleasure to have on the property.    </p>    <h3>      DOLLARS AND OTHER REWARDS    </h3>    <p>      A typical work day comprises five to six hours of actual      milling and one to three hours of sharpening, repairs,      material movement, and other maintenance chores.      And-since the mill is very much a labor of      love-we often put in additional hours of planning and      construction activity.    </p>    <p>      Altogether, our start-up investment in machinery and      lumber, plus part-time "hired" labor, hovers close to      $15,000, and-though we were in operation, during our      first year, for only five months out of a nine-month      season-we recorded 52 business transactions for a      value of about $4,000. At the beginning of our second      season, however, we already had a waiting list of four      weeks of custom work. At that rate, we plan to recover the      dollar portion of our investment-after costs and      wages-by the end of the third or fourth year.    </p>    <p>      There are other rewards, too ... including the learning      that comes from working as a team: During tough times, our      family really pulled together. And lumber-unlike the      two-year-old steer that wouldn't wait for sale and      consumption-is <em>always</em> ready and never grows      old or tough, gets sick, or requires dally care. (As a      personal bonus, Mary prefers the fragrance of wood to the      heavier odors of a cow barn.)    </p>    <p>      This winter, while the machines are temporarily idle, we're      busy constructing bins to organize the spring run of house      molding . . . and our need to grow and learn is now      directed toward offering a more complete line of products.      (Since excellent basswood is available in the area, picture      frames, liners, and stretchers-made of this valued      wood-could become our specialty.) In any event, we're      determined to avoid the tedious repetition of labor common      in the majority of manufacturing shops.    </p>    <p>      It seems important to point out that lumber processing is      only <em>one</em> of many possible applications of      recycling privately owned resources (such as a barn and      land), and-as we haven't copied anyone else's      experience-we don't advise others to copy ours,      necessarily. We simply wanted to share the details of our      enterprise in the hope that you, too, can use initiative to      redirect your particular "resources" when necessary.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, if you're in our area, drop in at the      "mill-farm" near Lochlin, Ontario. (You'll be able to hear      the song of my saw some distance away.) Our visitors seem      to enjoy the smell and touch of new lumber products-      <em>and</em> the excitement of watching steel shape      wood-almost as much as we do!    </p>
