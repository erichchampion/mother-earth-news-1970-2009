                    <p>      ---- <strong>Cynthia VanderZwaag      shares some Canadian yuletide cookin':</strong>      ----    </p>        <p>      For just a moment, imagine that you're here on our Nova      Scotia homestead. The fierce wind of a hard winter      snowstorm shakes our windows and batters the surf against      the ice-piled shore of the bay. But inside ... ah,      <em>inside</em> our snug island cabin a crackling fire      keeps us cozy-warm and-best of all-bakes our      special, sugarless holiday treats: three large, doughy      "candy canes", a sweet-tooth-pleasing "Christmas wreath",      and some zesty yuletide molasses cookies.    </p>    <h3>      OLD-FASHIONED MOLASSES COOKIES    </h3>    <p>      We find all <em>three</em> of our Christmas confections      hard to resist, but the molasses cookies make for some      especially good eatin'. To "batch up" these crispy treats,      cream 1/2 cup of goose fat (use lard or some other      conventional shortening only if you <em>have</em> to!)      together with the same amount of butter, then beat in 1      teaspoon of ginger and 2 cups of molasses. Next, in a      separate container, combine 1/3 cup of hot tea with 2      teaspoons of baking soda, and alternately add this tea brew      <em>and</em> 4-1/2 cups of well-sifted flour to the creamed      mixture.    </p>    <p>      You should chill this prepared dough for a bit before you      roll it out-to a 3/8" thickness-on a floured      board. Try cutting round cookies (the recipe yields around      42 crispy 2-1/2" circles) ... or be creative and design      angels, "gingerbread" figures, birds, butterflies, stars,      bells, and other festive shapes. Bake your treats for 10 to      15 minutes in a 350°F oven (watch 'em close so they      don't burn) and then decorate the      finished-cooled-fixin's with raisins, nuts, or      a flavorful sugarless icing. (The last-mentioned spread can      be prepared by slowly adding 1/4 cup of honey and 1/2      teaspoon of vanilla-or peppermint-extract to an      already well-whipped egg white ... and then continuing to      beat the entire mixture until it thickens.)    </p>    <h3>      CANDY CANES    </h3>    <p>      To cook up some large-and luscious-replacements      for those all-too-common striped holiday sugar sticks,      first let 1-3/4 cup of yogurt or sour cream heat up to room      temperature. Then place 2 table-spoons of yeast in 1/2 cup      of warm water, and allow the bread starter to "brew" for      five minutes ... while you stir together your yogurt, 1/4      cup of softened butter, 2 beaten eggs, and 1/4 cup of      honey. Next, add the readied "yeast juice" and 3 cups of      flour to the yogurt-based mixture .. . and beat these      ingredients together until smooth. After that, mix in 1 cup      of bran flakes and another 3 cups (more or less) of      flour... to produce a nice soft dough.    </p>    <p>      Knead the mass on a well-floured surface for eight minutes,      then place it in a greased bowl, flip it over (to      "lubricate" the entire surface), and cover the container.      Let your dough rise-in a warm place -until it      doubles in bulk. At that point, put the mix through a      second kneading and rising cycle, then knead the dough one      <em>more</em> time, and divide the spongy blend into three      equal parts.    </p>    <p>      Roll each segment out until it's thin enough to produce a      5" X 16" rectangle, and next place the three flat "loaves"      on greased cookie sheets. Then spread one cup of dried      fruit (apricots, cherries, dates, raisins, currants, etc.)      on each rectangle, fold 'em over and pinch their sides      together to form long rolls, and flip 'em so their "seams"      are on the bottom.    </p>    <p>      Now cut small stripelike diagonal slits-one inch      apart-down each roll, stretch each doughy log out to      a 22" length, and shape it like a candy cane (or "draw"      someone's initial). Bake the three confections for 15 to 20      minutes at 375° F, brush their tops with butter, then      cool the canes and decorate them with sugarless icing and      nuts.    </p>    <h3>      A CHRISTMAS WREATH    </h3>    <p>      You can concoct the dough for this last treat by following      the candy cane recipe ... but make the following changes:      Use one less teaspoon of salt-as well as one less cup      of flour-and substitute a cup of previously scalded,      room-temperature milk for the yogurt. Then, once your dough      has been kneaded for the third time, all you have to do is      braid it into a Christmas wreath (or shape a tree, or a      Star of David). Coat the goodie with a simple fruit glaze      (made by combining 4 to 5 tablespoons of fruit purée      or jelly with one well-beaten egg), bake this Christmas      coffee cake at 400° F for 25 minutes, and decorate the      sweet with fruit and nuts.    </p>    <h3>      PEACE AND CONTENTMENT    </h3>    <p>      By now, all our pastries have been cooked to perfection.      We're sitting with our stocking feet propped on the open      oven door ... drinking cups of hot milk and honey and      gobbling down our homemade treats. The storm has ended:      Fresh, unbroken snow coats the countryside, and we're all      planning to get outdoors to explore our "new" winter      landscape.    </p>    <p>      Yessir, we're just about ready to get all bundled up and      trudge out into that crisp, invigorating December air. In      fact, we're <em>definitely</em> going to trek outside, just      as soon as ... as soon as.... Say, hon ... could you pass      me another cookie?    </p>
