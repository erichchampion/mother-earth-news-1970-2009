                <p>      Diane Downs describes about the easiest possible way to get      some critters on your homestead.    </p>        <hr />    <div class="sidebar">      <div class="image">        <img src="../images/060-120-01-junix3.jpg" alt="060-120-01-junix3.jpg" width="150" height="110" />				</div>      <div class="image">        <img src="../images/060-120-01-junix2.jpg" alt="060-120-01-junix2.jpg" width="150" height="110" />				</div>      <div class="image">        <img src="../images/060-120-01-junix1.jpg" alt="060-120-01-junix1.jpg" width="125" height="297" />        <p class="credit">          PHOTOS BY STAN DOWNS        </p>      </div>    </div>    <p>      Then Candy and Bill Reis moved to a farm complete with lots      of empty outbuildings-they couldn't wait to "stock"      their land with all kinds of critters . . . but the cost of      buying an assortment of barnyard beasts proved to be beyond      their means.    </p>    <p>      However, Candy wasn't about to give up ... instead, she      simply ran a $1.00 ad in the local paper that said,      "WANTED: Your unwanted ducks, chickens, rabbits ... or any      other farm animals you no longer need."    </p>    <p>      The response was overwhelming! Although Candy's initial      intention was to get a number of large laying hens, that      was about all she <em>didn't</em> get during the several      weeks her ad was run! Instead, her request brought over 70      chickens (from banties and eight-year-old layers to      roosters), 11 rabbits (some were certified prizewinners),      eight ducks, one goose, one dog, two cats, four young male      goats, and an eight-year-old milking doe who had miscarried      (but had possibly been rebred to a registered buck).    </p>    <h3>      KNOW WHEN TO SAY "NO"    </h3>    <p>      If you want to try the Reises' approach to livestock      acquisition, be sure to pay attention to the following      pointers (which -Candy says-are bits of wisdom      <em>she</em> had to learn the <em>hard</em> way).    </p>    <p>      First, if someone offers you animals that you have no      desire to care for or consume (as folks undoubtedly will)      ... <em>know how to say no!</em> Also-while you're      polishing your diplomacy- consider in advance a      tactful (as well as honest) answer when someone asks for      reassurance that "you're not going to butcher them, are      you? " (More than a few people will get misty at the      thought of their "babies" winding up on someone's dinner      table.)    </p>    <p>      Second, know how to <em>care for</em> the animals you      choose to accept (it's best to do your research on raising      <em>small</em> livestock ... because, as Candy points out,      "It's not likely that anyone will offer you a cow, horse,      or pig"), and be sure to glean any and all available      information from the offered beasts' previous owners.    </p>    <p>      Then, too, if you have no buildings that can be used for      animal shelter-and if your climate or predator      conditions require that you provide cover for your      "adoptees" -you'll have to decide whether you can      actually afford your "free" livestock! You must also be      sure to have your facilities ready <em>before you</em>      bring the orphans home. (Nothing sours a person's      relationship with his or her animal faster than, for      instance, to have the newly acquired goats eat all of a      neighbor's prize tulips before a fence Is erected.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, be prepared-financially-to feed the      livestock you intend to keep. Good, nutritionally balanced      foods are essential to the maintenance of healthy,      productive beasts.., which are the <em>only</em> kind of      critters <em>anyone</em> should keep!    </p>    <h3>      ALL'S WELL    </h3>    <p>      Candy's freezer is now full ... and there is      livestock-both furred and feathered-galore on the      Reis farm. The ducks are nesting around the large pond, the      doe is due to kid, the banties provide enough eggs for the      family (with some left over to sell), and the rabbits ...      well, they're doing what bunnies do best. In fact, if you      happened to show up at Candy's door, you might well be met      with the words: "Say, can you use some rabbits?"    </p>
