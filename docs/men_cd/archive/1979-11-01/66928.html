                <p>      <em>Here’s mini-project for the holiday handyman or      –woman…</em>    </p>            <p>      Findin' a pair of wooden food tongs can -in this day      and age-be about like look-in' for a needle in a      haystack . . . and, if you <em>are</em> fortunate enough to      locate a "timber" utensil, its quality will often leave a      lot to be desired.    </p>    <p>      That's why Emerson Smyers (one of MOTHER'S research      department helpers) worked up this dandy little tool for      his personal kitchen. He began by cutting and planing two      10" pieces of black walnut to 1-1/4" wide and 5/16" thick.      Then Emerson set his table saw to cut 1/8" deep (such a      setting-on that <em>particular</em> saw-leaves      a 1-7/8"-long section of the blade showing above the table      top), positioned a stop at a point 3/16" in front of the      blade, and <em>carefully</em> pushed each length of wood      flat and sideways across the arc of the blade to shape the      cupped tong tips. (If you don't have a table saw, a      carefully wielded coping saw or round file will accomplish      this same task.)    </p>    <p>      With the tool's "business end" prepared, MOM'S helper cut a      3/8" X 4-1/2" slot out of one of the walnut pieces, and      made two 4-1/2" cuts-3/8" apart-in the other      piece ... using a fine coping saw. He then sawed two      45° bevels, beginning 7/16" from the uncupped end of      the male side of the tongs as shown.    </p>    <p>      The rest was simple . . . Emerson merely rounded the ends      on both pieces of wood, drilled a 1/8" hole squarely      through both the male and female parts of the hinge (about      3/16" from the end), and drove a 1/8" dowel through all      three holes. After trimming the dowel, he sanded the walnut      smooth with extra-fine paper, and left the wood's surface      in its natural state ... without any finish.    </p>    <p>      As far as Emerson is concerned-and his opinion is      shared by a whole lot of MOTHER-type folks-metal      utensils have no place in the preparation of many kinds of      food ... whether it be stewed fruit, pickled cucumbers, or      just plain tossed salad. And <em>any</em> task that demands      nonmetallic nippers-from rescuing toast from an      electric oven to lifting photo prints out of      solution-is a snap for these wooden wonders.    </p>
