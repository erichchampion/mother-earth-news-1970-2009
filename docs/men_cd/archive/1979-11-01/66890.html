                <hr />        <hr />                            <p>      With the prices of most commercially available foods (which      are, in many cases, of questionable nutritional value)      skyrocketing, a multitude of Americans not only have turned      to organic gardening as an alternative source of many      wholesome edibles, but also supplement their homegrown      diets with free-for-the-finding wild foods.    </p>    <p>      And, although most foragers have assumed right along that      the gratuitous fare-free of additives and genetically      untampered with-is naturally whole0000some, the      increased public interest in wild food plants has created a      demand for some hard facts on the nutritional quality of      such edibles.    </p>    <h3>      HOW GOOD ARE THEY?    </h3>    <p>      Having taught courses in foraging for some years, I've been      challenged many times with the query, "How do you know this      plant is nutritious? " In most cases, I could only quote      the author of a book on wild foods as my source,      who-often as not-referred to an earlier writer,      who may well have based his statements on folklore.    </p>    <p>      This lack of solid data led me to work up a systematic      collection of all available scientific research on the      subject, and then to compare each particular wild edible      with the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) established by      the National Academy of Sciences' Food and Nutrition Board      ... which represents the absolute minimum requirement for      nutrients in normal, healthy people.    </p>    <p>      A typical male adult, for example, needs 5,000 I.U.      (International Units) of vitamin A per day, and he can get      much more than that in a scant half-cup of cooked dandelion      greens! Or take that bane-of-the-farmer, amaranth: Just 10      ounces of the leaves or tips of this prolific plant can      provide an adult's daily calcium needs, plus almost all the      iron requirement for men and half that for women ... while      only 3.5 ounces of the greens will meet the daily needs for      vitamin A, thiamine, and ascorbic acid.    </p>    <p>      You see, then, that you can assure yourself of a      well-balanced diet by combining produce from your garden      with wild edibles in season. Beyond that you can freeze,      dry, can, or pickle many of your surplus wildlings for      out-of-season-use.    </p>    <h3>      TABLE TALK    </h3>    <p>      The blank spaces in the accompanying chart-"The      Nutritional Composition of Wild Food Plants"      -indicate that an edible has not yet been analyzed      for those particular food elements. Some nutritional      variation from the figures given can be expected with      differences in climate, soil conditions, and time of      harvest. Similarly, where "spp." is noted, it's an      indication that more than one species in the genus is      edible, so some differences can be expected among species.      Usually, however, such variations are comparatively small      and don't affect the food's overall nutritional quality.      You'll also find a number of fruits, berries, and field      crops included in the table which are actually cultivated      varieties that can often be found in the wild.    </p>    <p>      CAUTION: The listing of a plant in this article doesn't      necessarily mean that it Is edible under all circumstances.      Readers should inform themselves fully (by crossreferencing      with a good field guide) as to any wild food's safety      before consuming it, since frequently a plant may be      poisonous at one stage in its development and edible at      another ... or-as with domestic rhubarb and      potatoes-one part of the species may be edible, while      other sections are poisonous.    </p>    <p>      In order to get some overview of the various nutrients      covered in the list, I'd like to "spotlight" a sampling of      plants and nutritional categories. Let's begin by      discussing the foods that provide the most calories. Most      folks have no trouble consuming enough starches, sugars,      and fats for their energy needs (on the contrary, such      elements are in oversupply in the average North American's      diet), but-among the wild edibles-only nuts,      seeds, tubers, and a few fruits provide such "energy to      burn" in significant amounts. Most wild foods have less      than a gram of fat per 100 grams, and they're often      low-usually containing only several grams-in      carbohydrates as well ... which means you can fill up on      many wildlings without putting on weight.    </p>    <p>      Most of us also get enough protein in our diets ... from      meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. However, if you're      a vegetarian or want to supply part of your minimum daily      need (50 grams of protein) from vegetable sources, the      following plants will provide five or more grams of protein      for each 100 grams (about 3-1/4 ounces) consumed:    </p>        <p>      <strong>NATURE'S NUTRIENTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Wild foods can also play an important role in satisfying      your body's daily vitamin and mineral requirements. For      example, the average man or woman needs a minimum of 800 to      1,200 milligrams (mg.) of calcium- the body's most      abundant mineral-every day. Here's how a few wild      plants stack up in comparison with milk (the most commonly      mentioned calcium source) in milligrams per 100 grams of      food:    </p>        <p>      Iron is usually obtained from meats, shellfish, and whole      grains. Adult men need 10 mg. of this mineral daily, women      18 mg., and children 15 mg. Here's a sampling of wild foods      and the amounts of iron they offer per 100 grams as      compared to beef liver, one of the best "supermarket"      sources:    </p>        <p>      Liver and kidney are among the best "conventional" sources      of vitamin A, while deep yellow and dark green vegetables      supply carotene ... which the body can convert into this      important nutrient. Adult males, as we said above, need      5,000 I.U. of "A" daily ... while females require 4,000      units. The following wildlings contain more than either of      those I.U. requirements in a 100-gram serving:    </p>        <p>      Three of the B vitamins- thiamine, riboflavin, and      niacin-are (in the "usual" diet) obtained from meat,      milk, whole grains, and especially from the organ meats.      But since adults require a daily minimum of only 1.25 mg.      of thiamine, a "standard" serving of many wild foods can      satisfy (or help fill) the need for this nutrient.    </p>        <p>      <strong>BETTER HEALTH ... FOR FREE!</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the past, some people (and I was one of them) were      justifiably skeptical of unsupported allegations regarding      the healthfulness of many well-publicized wild foods. But      now that the scientific evidence for more than 80 plants is      in (and included in the chart on pages 112-113), there's no      reason we shouldn't forage a large proportion of our meals.      We'll eat better ... stay healthier (just getting outdoors      to find the plants is a good start!) ... and-best of      all-we can watch our food budget <em>shrink</em> for      a change!    </p>
