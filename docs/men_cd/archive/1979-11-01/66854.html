                <p>      <em><strong>P.A. Schippers describes a new way to "get your      feet wet" in hydroponics:</strong></em>    </p>        <hr />        <p>      Hydroponic gardening is nothing new to most of MOTHER's      readers . . . because the traditional methods of growing      plants without soil were all discussed in the "Hydroponics      Mini-Manual" that this magazine published on pages 80-84 of      our Issue No. 43.    </p>    <p>      Hand watering, wick growing, and periodic flooding with      nutrients (using a pump and timer)-all methods which have      their advantages and disadvantages-were described in that      story. But now there's a new way to grow plants in liquid      culture that offers some significant improvements upon the      traditional procedures: It's the Nutrient Flow (or Film)      Technique, or NFT.    </p>    <p>      Based on research begun by England's Dr. A. J. Cooper in      1972, NFT is a system that uses a "film" of nutrient      solution . . . which flows continuously over the bottom of      the channel containing the plants. The fertile fluid is      constantly recirculated, and can be used (with periodic      enrichment) for several weeks.    </p>    <p>      American researchers at the Long Island Horticultural      Research Laboratory of Cornell University have been working      with NFT since 1975 . . . and they claim the technique's      versatility is enormous! For example, unlike other forms of      hydroponics, NFT can be used with or without a growing      medium (the latter method eliminates the otherwise      necessary beds of heavy-and hard to sterilizegravel) . . .      it can be set up with either horizontal or vertical growing      beds . . . it's practical both indoors and out . . . and      it's economical to use and basic in design.    </p>    <p>      An NFT system is a snap to assemble, too. All that's needed      are [1] a growing bed of some sort, [2] two containers      (plastic wastebaskets or dishpans are perfect for this job,      but avoid unlined metal containers) . . . the first to      supply the nutrient-by gravity feed-to the growing bed and      the second to act as a receiving basin to collect the fluid      after it has trickled past the roots, and [3] a pump,      connecting pipes or tubing, and some screw clips to be used      as control valves.    </p>    <p>      The fertilizer solution is contained in the elevated      nutrient tank, from which it travels-by way of plastic or      rubber hose-to the growing bed. The rate of nutrient flow      is easily controlled by a screw clip on the tubing. The      liquid passes through the growing bed (which is at a      minimum 2 or 3% tilt) and then drains into the receiving      (or catchment) tank . . . picking up oxygen as it spills      into the receptacle. The fluid completes the cycle when a      pump in the lower tank-cued by the tripping of a float      switch in the upper container-kicks in and sends the      nutrient on its way upward.    </p>    <p>      In addition, a third tank-which holds water to replace      liquid losses caused by transpiration and evaporation-can      be added to automate even more of the process. The      replacement liquid is introduced into the lower tank when a      float valve trips. And that's all there is to it!      Basically, the Nutrient Flow Technique system is a closed      loop that uses gravity to supply the fertilizer to the      growing bed and a pump to raise the liquid back to its      starting point.    </p>    <h3>      LATTICE YOUR LETTUCE    </h3>    <p>      The NFT approach allows a great deal of flexibility in the      layout of the growing beds. Tomatoes and cucumbers started      in Kys Kubes or Jiffy-7's (available in most garden supply      stores) can, for instance, be grown in sections of plastic      roof gutter without any growing medium. Or, if you fill the      gutters with several inches of perlite, you can raise      cauliflower or other heavy-heading produce. A lattice grid      of 2 X 4's-with a sheet of plastic forming channels between      the boards-will support a huge crop of butterhead lettuce      in a sparse two inches of perlite, while a slightly sloping      bed of plywood-with 1" X 6" sides and a polyethylene      liner-can be constructed to almost any dimension and used      for just about any vegetable from radishes to beets.    </p>    <h3>      VERTICAL VEGETABLES    </h3>    <p>      Tall plants, such as tomatoes or cucumbers, are common in      hydroponic culture, but NFT allows normally "horizontal"      crops-such as lettuce, spinach, or even houseplants-to be      grown in spacesaving, sun-seeking vertical gardens.      Two-inch-diameter PVC pipes-pierced with holes that      accommodate preplanted Jiffy-7's-become lush green columns      (the nutrient gravity-feeds in at the top . . . moistens      the roots as t flows down inside the pipe . . . and is      collected at the bottom to be cycled back again). A similar      space saver is the "cascade" arrangement, in which slightly      sloping (alternately right and left) PVC-pipe beds are      positioned one above another. The nutrient solution flows      in at the high end of the top pipe, passes from the low end      of that tube to the high end of the next one, and zig-zags      its way to the bottom . . . feeding the roots all the way      down.    </p>    <p>      It's even possible to make a "radish Aframe" from plywood      sheets covered first with plastic and then with capillary      matting (sold by greenhouse specialty stores). Simply sew      felt weatherstripping onto the matting, and tuck your      radish seeds into the flaps. A plastic feed pipe-on top of      the structure-delivers a constant stream of nutrient      solution, which flows down the matting to catchment gutters      at the bottom . . . and then, of course, the liquid is      pumped back up to the top.    </p>    <h3>      SOUP IT UP!    </h3>    <p>      Since hydroponically grown plants are solely dependent upon      the "feed" that you give them for nourishment, careful      attention to nutrient formulas and handling techniques will      be vital to your water garden's success. There are three      factors to consider: the ingredients, pH, and potency of      the nutrient solution.    </p>    <p>      Everyone connected with hydroponics seems to have his or      her favorite fertilizer formula. I've had good results with      Hydro-Sol-a product of the Robert B. Peters Co., and      available from many garden centers-with the addition of      anounce of calcium nitrate for each ounce of the commercial      product. Two ounces of this mixture will yield 15 gallons      of nutrient . . . and will supply all the nitrogen,      phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and calcium (as well as      the trace elements iron, boron, copper, zinc, manganese,      and molybdenum) that most plants need. Other good      commercial mixtures are available from garden centers under      the names Hyponex, Dr. Chatelier, and Ra-Pid-Gro . . . and      many mailorder suppliers offer their own blends.    </p>    <p>      Organic gardeners have often expressed concern about the      use of chemical plant foods in hydroponics. I must admit      that I find the explanation given by James B.      DeKorne-MOTHER NOS. 29 (page 68), 39 (page 32), and 48      (page 97) -convincing. Jim says that-while organic      fertilizers are clearly superior in soil culture, where      bacteria in the growing medium can break down the nutrients      to their ultimate (and usable) form -in hydroponics we feed      the plant, not the "soil" . . . and the nutrients must be      in an already broken-down form for the roots to absorb      them. Those who aren't swayed by DeKorne's argument should      look at MOTHER NO. 44, page 106, for some all-natural plant      food recipes. Pyramid Hydroponics (see Editor's Note) also      offers an organic fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      However he or she may feel about the question of natural      vs. manufactured fertilizer, though, there are still two      other items that demand the novice hydroponic gardener's      attention: maintaining the proper pH in the solution, and      assuring the potency of the nutrients. It's easy to monitor      the acid/alkaline balance (or pH) with nitrazine paper      (available from most any drugstore) or by using test kits      sold by hydroponics suppliers.    </p>    <p>      Plants generally do best with a slightly acid nutrient . .      . so a pH of 6 to 6.5 (pH 7 is neutral) is desirable. As      the roots remove chemicals from the fertilizer, the pH of      the liquid tends to drift toward the alkaline . . . which      causes some nutrients (especially iron) to precipitate out,      and thus become unavailable to the plants. A small quantity      of distilled white vinegar-remember that a teaspoon of the      acidic liquid per gallon of nutrient will drop the pH by      two points!-will restore the proper "sourness" to the      solution . . . while you can make the fluid more alkaline      (less often a problem) by adding a small amount-monitored      by nitrazine paper tests-of lime or bicarbonate of soda.    </p>    <h3>      STRONG WATERS    </h3>    <p>      Most plant food manufacturers have adopted a "baby with the      bath water" approach to maintaining nutrient potency. Since      the chemical analysis of hydroponic fertilizer is an      exacting (and expensive) process, the advice usually      offered is to chuck the soup out after a week or two . . .      preferably under a favorite fruit tree, where it might do      some good! However, Hydroponic Growing Systems-a supplier      that specializes in the NFT method-does offer a kit that      permits a simple test of chemical strength . . . and that      can help you avoid tossing out a jug of nutrient before its      time.    </p>    <h3>      ON LOCATION    </h3>    <p>      The Nutrient Flow Technique is enormously versatile, but      certain sites are more appropriate to its use than are      others. Given the amount of plumbing involved in      hydroponics, for instance, living rooms are probably not      the ideal place to set up an NFT system. And-unless you're      planning to grow houseplants (which can flourish under      fluorescent lights)-the dark corner of your basement      is out of the question. A greenhouse, of course, is an      ideal location for an NFT installation . . . and enormous      quantities of vegetables can be raised in even a small,      sunny spare room. In addition, don't forget that (given a      receiving tank big enough to hold any overflow caused by      rainfall) all sorts of crops can be grown outside . . . in      the country, suburbs, or inner city! Apartment roofs,      narrow urban back yards, small waste places . . . all can      be turned into gardens of plenty with NFT!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> <em>Equipment that's designed for      NFT-Plus a 60-page report on the method (titled "The      Nutrient Flow Technique for Growing Plants") which costs      $3.25 plus 35 cents for shipping-may be ordered from      Hydroponic Growing Systems, Dept.
