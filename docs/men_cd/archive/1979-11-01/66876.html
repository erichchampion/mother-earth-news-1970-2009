                <p>      <em><strong>Here's the latest in alcohol-powered vehicle      technology . . .</strong></em>    </p>        <hr />        <p>      In our last issue, we described the process of converting a      gasoline-burning automotive engine to operate on      home-brewed ethyl alcohol (see MOTHER NO. 59, page 78), and      we also specified the particulars of rigging up a dual-fuel      system that would allow the vehicle to run on either      alcohol or gasoline with only a minimum of "switchover"      tinkering.    </p>    <p>      Now-with winter upon us-it's time to go one step further      with that conversion . . . and describe how to construct a      fool proof-and inexpensive-cold weather starting system.    </p>    <h3>      BACK TO BASICS    </h3>    <p>      As you know, alcohol fuel is desirable from a safety      standpoint, since it is not dangerously volatile, as is      gasoline. This advantage, however, can become a' minor      problem during the winter season (when the temperature is      below 45Â°F) because the carbureted ethanol fuel has a      tendency to <em>remain</em> in liquid form as it passes      through the engine's intake manifold . . . rather than turn      into a mist-like vapor as it should.    </p>    <p>      So, faced with this knotty problem, MOTHER's researchers      came up with a low-cost, easy answer . . . they merely      inject a fine stream of gasoline-taken from the auxiliary,      fuel supply-directly down the carburetor throat. The minute      spray is adequate to start the engine and keep it running      till it's warm enough to utilize pure alcohol fuel.    </p>    <h3>      DOIN' IT    </h3>    <p>      Start off by purchasing (or better yet; scrounging) all the      plumbing hardware called for in the accompanying illustra      tion. Then gather up an assortment of end wrenches, a      screwdriver, a power drill with a 7/16" bit, a soldering      iron, a small tubing cutter, and some Teflon thread tape.    </p>    <p>      When you have everything together, remove the air cleaner      lid from its housing and determine the best place to      position your "squirt" nozzle. Remember that you want the      sprayer to shoot directly down into the throat of the      carburetor, and that the movable choke plate should not      interfere with the injector pipette.    </p>    <p>      Now drill a 7/16" hole in the air cleaner cover at the spot      you've chosen (see Photo 1). Next, cut a short length of      1/4" copper tubing, then fasten the needle valve to the      elbow as in our illustration.    </p>    <p>      Finally, insert your copper tube into the opposite end of      the elbow and attach the entire assembly to the sir filter      cap (Photo 2).    </p>    <p>      With this "nozzle holder" in place, you can now solder a      brass metering jet to its tip, as in Photo 3. Select a jet      that will fit into the end of the pipe, and-if      possible-choose one with a tiny orifice (a hole about.020"      is fine). If you've picked up a nozzle with too large an      opening, simply solder it partially shut by inserting a      thin needle into the opening and removing it after the      solder has set.    </p>    <p>      Now place the air filter lid on top of its housing, bolt      the cap into position, and go on to complete the plumbing      circuit as depicted in our illustration. Remember that this      system is designed to be used in conjunction with the      dual-fuel setup featured in MOTHER NO. 59, so it's merely a      matter of replacing the circuitry-described in that      issue-between the auxiliary fuel pump and the main fuel      line, and installing the combination of parts detailed      here.    </p>		<h3>MAKE IT WORK!</h3>    <p>      Once your cold-start system has been installed, you'll find      it easy to operate. Just before cranking over your engine,      open your choke (if it's manually controlled) and flip on      (for a few seconds) the switch that activates the secondary      gasoline pump. Then shut it off, close the choke as you      would normally, and fire the engine up. It should start      immediately and-in less than frigid weather-run on alcohol      alone. On <em>extremely</em> cold days, you may have to      inject additional gasoline as the engine is running.. and,      since the choke flap is normally pulled partially open by      the vacuum draw of the engine, you can leave the choke in a      closed position till the engine warms and not interfere      with the necessary flow of gasoline.    </p>    <p>      If your vehicle is equipped with an automatic choke, you      can either install a manual conversion kit (available at      most auto parts stores for about $6.00) or adjust the choke      so it remains partially open even when the engine is cold.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's researchers have-so far -had nothing but success      with their newly plumbed "rig" . . . and can even run the      engine on the "squirting's" alone. In severely cold      climates, a slightly larger injection jet orifice might be      required, but that's just a minor adjustment. In the      meantime, though, we've been working on additional engine      modifications, and we'll have more on those in MOTHER NO.      61!    </p>
