        <h3>AN ALCOHOL/OILCAN LAMP</h3><p>When you need a little light or a small "work" flame, why not make this easy oilcan lamp? Simply cut off the spout an inch or so above the can ... drill a tiny vent hole close to the screw top ... insert a wick ... and make a cap-to extinguish the fire-out of a piece of tubing that's closed at one end. The "snuffer" may then be soldered to a piece of chain that is in turn-fastened to the lamp</p><h3>AN ICE-SKIMMER</h3><p>You can remove excess fat from hot soup with an ice cube that's wrapped in a clean cloth. As the grease congeals, it will cling to the cloth and can then be rinsed off in a bowl of hot water.</p><h3>CANDLE CLEANER</h3><p>Soiled candles will look like new if you rub 'em--up and downwith a soft cloth that's been dampened with kerosene. Next, reharden the wax with another cloth dipped in cold water. And, to finish off, polish the candles to a lustrous sheen by rubbing them briskly with a crumpled sheet of tissue paper.</p><h3>"COAT" YOUR PAINT!</h3><p>If you have to do some outdoor paintin' in cold weather, try place Ing your paint can In a pan I warm water. Of course, you'll ha to add more heated H20 fro time to time, but the warm liquid will keep your paint from getting too thick to spread.</p><h3>TENDER GLOVING CARE?</h3><p>When you need an icebag but find that there's none around, just grab a rubber glove, fill it with all pieces of ice, and wind a rub ber band tightly around Its wrist area. Such a makeshift "soother' works fine for emergencies!</p><h3>TETHER TECHNOLOGY</h3><p>Should your cow or goat have a tendency to Injure its legs on the stake to which you've tethered it (this often happens when repeated pounding has caused the peg to become " mushroomed "-and thus jagged-edged-on the top), merely invert a bucket over the offending "spike", and your animal will be safe.</p><h3>PUTTY IN YOUR CANS</h3><p>Don't discard those empty tin cans. Paint 'em with some enamel ... let 'em dry ... then add a layer of putty to their outsides; and work rough designs into the soft material with your hands. After the "sculpture" has dried, paint It ... and you'll end up with an attractive, unique flowerpot'</p>
