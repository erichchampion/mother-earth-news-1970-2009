                <p>      <em>For those who like homemade rugs-but hate sewin'      the braids together-here's...</em>    </p>        <p>      ----------------MARY      PLEDGE      PETERSON:-----------------    </p>        <p>      By adding one extra step to the standard three-strand      braiding process, you can produce a dense, sturdy      interwoven rug that's reversible to boot!    </p>    <p>      The supplies you'll need for this project are probably      already on hand, too: needle, thread, thimble, scissors, a      large crochet hook (about size K), and some tightly woven,      medium-weight cloth (such as worn sheets, tablecloths,      curtains, and clothing) that won't ravel excessively.    </p>    <p>      For a 2' X 3' oval rug, cut 300 strips of fabric at least      1" X 24". If you <em>tear</em> the material, the resulting      ravelings will make for an unsightly floor covering...      and-although the cutting process <em>is</em>      tedious-remember that the pieces don't all have to be      exactly the same size. Just measure the first one-so      you'll know what to aim for-and "eyeball" the rest...      being sure your errors produce wider, rather than narrower,      strips. (Variations in <em>length</em> are actually      advantageous, since the basted-on extensions won't all      appear in the same place and cause lumps in your braided      masterwork.)    </p>    <h3>      HOW IT WORKS    </h3>    <p>      To begin the rug, line up the ends of three cloth strips on      top of each other, make two diagonal cuts through all three      layers-so that they come to a point-then baste      them together at the tip as shown in Fig. 1.    </p>    <p>      Next, separate the strips... crush them slightly... and      make a loose 12" braid. Whenever your "weaving" process      takes you to the end of a strip, add on another by trimming      the ends diagonally... overlapping them about 1/4"... and      basting them together (see Fig. 2).    </p>    <p>      When a 12" section is finished, turn the braid around so      that the working end is away from you... holding the "loose      ends" in place to keep 'em from unraveling. Look carefully      at what you've done and compare it with Fig. 3. Notice      that- on each side of the midline-there's a      series of what I call "loops". During the first round,      you'll be working with the loops on the left... then you'll      turn the corner and use each loop on the <em>right</em> .    </p>    <p>      To begin this part of the operation, insert the crochet      hook down and all the way through the first loop on the      left (see Fig. 3), then bend the loose ends of the strips      around to the left-to form a corner-and begin      to braid toward you. However, the first strip that comes      from underneath the others (as shown in Fig. 4) is      pulled-with the crochet hook-completely through      the first loop (Fig. 5) and is crossed over to the left as      you begin to braid again. The very next strip that comes      under is pulled up through the second loop, as in Fig. 6.    </p>    <h3>      KEEP IT UP!    </h3>    <p>      Continue in this manner, pulling a strip (always the one      coming from underneath) up through each successive loop,      until you reach the last one on that side. This final loop      should be passed through by a <em>second</em> strip... to      provide extra fabric for a flat corner. (Fig. 7 shows the      last loop after it's been used twice, as well as the other      three "corner" loops... which should each have two strips      pulled up through them as they're "rounded".)    </p>    <p>      Turn the braid around again, make the second corner, and      continue to work... pulling one strip up through each      remaining loop on the other side of the original 12" braid.      Then repeat the cornering procedure: Use the last loop      twice... turn the work... and use the first loop twice.      That should bring you to the end of the first round and      will be the last time it's necessary to pull two strands      through a single loop.    </p>    <p>      Once the initial "circle" is completed, you'll work with      the outside braid loops of the previous round. Continue to      braid and pull one strip up through each loop until all the      strips are used. Then-to finish off your work of      art-pull all three strips through a loop, sew them in      place securely, and cut them flush with the rug (Fig. 8).      The end won't be noticeable if the braiding is terminated      just <em>before</em> you turn a corner.    </p>    <p>      And one other thing: The secret to a rug that never puckers      in the center is loose, even braiding. Therefore, make sure      you loosen the previous "knot" after each pull-through...      and remember that it's <em>especially</em> important that      you work loosely around the corners.    </p>    <p>      While it may take you a little time to get into the      "rhythm" of this rugmaking method, your pretty-and      durable-end products should last for years!    </p>
