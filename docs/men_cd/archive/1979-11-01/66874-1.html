        But MOTHER's log lopper will do even more in its completely self-powered form. You can latch the hitch to your car or truck and tow the splitter to the trees . . . where it will either cut wood while still mounted to the hitch, or can be detached and rolled up to the job . . . or you can pull the entire cutting assembly away from the chassis to tackle tougher tasks.
