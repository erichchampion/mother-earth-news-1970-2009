After all,      canine-powered snow-going is an <em>enjoyable</em> mode of      transportation (dogs are a lot friendlier than are jeeps or      snowmobiles), and dog sledding can be downright practical,      besides. I often make 60 miles a day with my five-member      team, for example, and also use dog sleds to haul lumber,      groceries, firewood-and more-out to my rural homestead.    </p>    <p>      If you live in an area that's snowbound during part of the      year, you can take advantage of dog power, too. You'll have      to secure good gear and beasts-and take the time to      properly train your pullers-but you'll find that the      rewards of sleddin' will be well worth the effort.    </p>  <h3> CHOOSING YOUR WORK DOGS</h3>    <p>      Regardless of its breed, however, a good sled dog      <em>must</em> have an obedient temperament. Many fine teams      have been formed around a family pet whose devotion to its      owner sets a fine example for the others. Another character      trait to look for in a potential puller is an ability to      get along with its peers. Infighting simply cannot be      tolerated in a sled team.    </p>    <p>      When you set out to form a group of "tundra trekkers",      you'll obviously have to decide <em>how many</em> dogs to      get. I've seen impressive teams consisting of as many as 20      canines, but I'd suggest you start out with just three.      Many novice mushers (we Alaskans call such amateurs      <em>cheechakos)</em> quickly find that trying to handle and      train more than three dogs can be a most confusing-and      frustrating-task.    </p>    <p>      After you gain some experience, you'll likely want to add      one or two more tail waggers to the team. Just be sure that      any untrained beasts undergo a five-day "getting      acquainted" period with the other dogs before being trained      for harness. And remember: <em>Never</em> tolerate the      slightest show of aggressive behavior from those new      critters or, for that matter, from <em>any</em> of your      dogs. You will pay dearly if you let them get away with      such methods of "showing their enthusiasm": As we say in      Alaska, vet bills are the medals of the cheechako!    </p>   <h3> SLEDS AND SLEDGES</h3>    <p>      Besides getting-and training-some dogs, you'll need a sled      (or a "freight" sledge) and a set of harnesses and lines.      Commercially available sleds are pretty much standardized      (the classic "Alaskan gold rush model" is widely used) and      can be obtained through the equipment shops listed in this      article's sidebar. An eight-foot snow runner makes the best      all-around sled for work and play, and can cost you      anywhere from $150 to $750. The wooden load luggers come in      two basic styles: The popular standard sled can-with the      help of three dogs-transport one person and five bags of      groceries, while the larger capacity freighter holds a      500-pound payload (not including the "musher") but      <em>does</em> require a minimum of five strong dogs.    </p>    <p>      All <em>store-bought</em> sleds come "shoed" with some form      of plastic runner (the build- it-yourselfer will find that      less expensive sheet tin works almost as well) and all such      snow-contacting surfaces should be coated with a special      friction-fighting compound called P-Tex (available from      sledding equipment suppliers). The sleds are also equipped      with a brush bow ... which is an expendable "front bumper"      (this piece of equipment will often get smashed in the      course of a season) that protects your sled from structural      damage when you meet up with the unusual-but famous-winter      tree that "pops up out of nowhere".    </p>    <p>      The easy-to-build sledge (called a <em>comitik</em> by the      Eskimos) is an even better hauling device than is the      "classic" freighter sled. This flat slider consists of      little more than a platform attached to a set of runners,      and can be easily put together out of 2 X 8's and plywood.      I've used my homebuilt comitik extensively and find it      perfect for hauling lumber and materials to remote cabin      sites.    </p>    <p>      Most ready-made sleds have a couple of hooked braking      devices ... but the experienced dog sledder normally uses a      dragging foot and a verbal command to stop the vehicle. A      veteran musher won't trust a brake hook to keep a harnessed      sled "parked", either ... but instead trains the team      always to lie down when the dogs are not pulling. (The      cheechako will undoubtedly endure-at least once-the      unenviable experience of being left behind as his or her      team and sled disappear over a hill.)    </p>    <h3>HARNESS AND LINES</h3>    <p>      Of course, well-trained dogs and a nicely built sled won't      do you much good unless you have some means for "getting      the two together" . . . that is, some lines and harnesses.      Each dog should have a properly fitting body yoke (these      are available for around $10 to $12 each from the same      firms that supply sleds). I use the versatile "fishback"      harness on my dogs, because it's comfortable and well      suited to fast travel.    </p>    <p>      Your animals will also need strong collars ... so they can      be "staked out" on the dog lot. These "necklaces" also      secure the lines that keep your "sled steeds" parallel to      the central line. Let me emphasize, however, that a dog      <em>should never be made to pull from his collar      alone!</em> A "tail line" -running from the back of the      harness to the central tow line -should bear that stress.    </p>    <p>      Tail and neck ropes are usually 1/2' thick, while the      central tow cord will have a 5/8" diameter ... and      <em>all</em> lines should be made from <em>braidednot</em>      twisted-nylon. Attachments can then be sewn through the      strands of such cord with a large plastic needle known as a      "fid" . . . and <em>you'll</em> be able to make easy line      adjustments in the field without going through the finger      chilling hassle of untying frozen knots.    </p>  <h3> TRAIN, TRAIN, TRAIN</h3>    <p>      Proper sled-dog training takes a lot of time but is a      vitally important task. Start -one animal at a time-by      acquainting the beast with the feel of its tote gear. Treat      this harnessing act seriously so your critter won't think      you're playing around ... and then take the animal out for      a normal leash walk, hooking your line from the      <em>back</em> of the harness on your "return trip".    </p>    <p>      Use subsequent walks to teach commands. Be consistent in      your choice of command words and the tone of voice you use.      Most dogs will quickly learn "HIKE" (or "MUSH" or "GET UP",      if you prefer), "WHOA", and "STAY". But only the smartest      canines will respond to the turning commands, "GEE" (right)      and "HAW" (left).    </p>    <p>      The most obedient of your dogs should receive special      treatment (to develop "lead dog mentality") and extensive      geehaw training as well. Don't choose the biggest, toughest      brute for your pack guide, but select instead the      quick-reflexed critter (often a female) that will follow      your commands without balking. A good leader is      indispensable for dog sledding ... so spend a lot of time      training this animal. (Often, the foremost position is      shared by two critters. This arrangement is particularly      useful for training a second leader who could fill in      should your "main mastiff" become disabled.)    </p>    <p>      In a full 'I set" the first two dogs behind the leader are      called "swing dogs" . . . because of their ability to turn      the team. The pair of pullers just in front of the sled are      the "wheel dogs" and are usually the strongest canines in      the group. (Some dogs shy away from the wheel      position-and yours will if you're not careful to keep      the sled from sliding into the critters-but it is a      nicely visible spot for training a newcomer.) Any      additional pullers are harnessed between the swing and      wheel pairs and known as team dogs.    </p>    <h3>ON, YOU HUSKIES!</h3>    <p>      The actual amount of work you can get out of your dogs will      be determined by endless variables ... including the      animals' experience and fitness, trail conditions, the size      of your load, the weather, and so forth. Most of the      dog-caused delays and difficulties (fighting, tangling,      etc.) will occur during training and, even then, probably      only take place within the first few miles on the trail.    </p>    <p>      My five "ace" dogs have often carried me over 60 miles in a      day, but it will probably take several months of training      and practice before your quintet can be expected to make      more than 40 (an average speed of six to seven miles per      hour is quite good for a team in its first season). I pace      my pullers-on long trips-by traveling at a      sustainable 8-10 MPH . . . and giving the dogs a half-hour      rest after every two hours of work.    </p>    <p>      Most dogs enjoy being out on the trail and will give you      everything they've got, so don't constantly berate your      pullers (only cheechakos yell commands just to hear      themselves talk) ... the dogs don't like being shouted at      any more than you would. Oh, you'll have an occasional,      obvious laggard ... but good training will make physical      punishment unnecessary for most dogs. I never use or even      carry a whip. (Don't hesitate, though, to get rid of the      "bad apple" who won't respond after being given a fair      chance.)    </p>    <p>      If one of your dogs slows down considerably while on the      trail, you may have to "basket" the animal ... that is, tie      it into the sled. (You should be prepared for this-and      other minor mishaps-by always carrying some spare short      cords and snaps.) If you <em>do</em> have to basket a      pooch, be sure to check its paws for cuts. In some      conditions- especially when you're sledding over icy,      broken trailsit may be necessary to "boot" all your dogs.      Foot protectors can be made from denim and fastened in      place with masking tape. Keep an eye out for bad trail      conditions so you can boot your beasts before they begin to      limp!    </p>    <p>      There're lots more sledding tips for a beginning musher to      learn, but most of them are either common sense or the kind      of knowledge that's best picked up as you go along ... so I      guess I should sign off now. However, I <em>would</em> like      to remind you of the most important rule for training and      working dogs: Never give a command that your pullers are      incapable of following ... or one that you're not prepared      to enforce! Follow this, and you'll all have a doggone good      time!    </p>    <p>      Good mushing with your team! And by the way, if you're      sledding out to the Nome gold fields sometime and happen to      pass through the Susitna Valley ... stop in and say hello!    </p>
