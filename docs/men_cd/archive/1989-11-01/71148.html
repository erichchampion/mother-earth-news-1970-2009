            <p>Issue # 120 - November/December 1989</p>		<p><strong>SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</strong></p>        <h3>An overview of the last five years' hot      gardening trends.</h3>		<h5 id="byline">      by Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>		    <p><strong>SINCE 1984, WHEN WE STARTED</strong>publishing our gardening      newsletter, Hort-Ideas, we've watched many new      horticultural developments take root and grow (or wither      away). Some of these are turning into definite trends      that-for better or for worse-will most likely      influence your gardening in the coming years.    </p>    <p><strong>The amazing neem!</strong> The insecticide of the      future is neem, a biological pesticide derived from a      tropical fruit tree. Its active ingredient, azadirachtin,      has been found to slow or stop the feeding of more than 150      pest insects and mites, including Japanese beetles, aphids,      whiteflies, and thrips. Yet it appears to have little      adverse effect on mammals, adult honeybees, or earthworms.      Because neem acts systemically (translocating throughout      plants after being added to the soil), the EPA currently is      cautious about approving its use. <strong>Trend:</strong>      Neem may largely replace conventional insecticides in home      and market gardens.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The killer bees are (still) coming.</strong> For      years, U.S. officials have been worrying about the      impending-and apparently inevitable-invasion of      South America's Africanized bees. But the "killer" bees      aren't all bad. Latin American beekeepers are already      learning how to join what they can't lick. They use larger      smokers and better protective clothing and locate hives      away from the public. Since the bees are aggressive      foragers that can thrive in areas where traditional      honeybees do not, some countries even have higher honey      yields than before. <strong>Trend:</strong> Africanized      bees may well form the basis for a new American apiculture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A low-spray apple a day.</strong> Thanks to the      dedication and persistence of a few orchardists and      researchers, we know much more about growing apples with      minimal pesticides than we did five years ago. Better      disease-resistant varieties and innovative trapping      techniques are also helping. <strong>Trend:</strong>      Amateur and commercial low-spray apple growing is here to      stay.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Here come the bug suckers!</strong> Oversized      vacuum cleaners for sucking pest insects off crops are now      routinely replacing chemical insecticides on New York,      Massachusetts, and California farms. Smaller vacuum devices      have been developed for use indoors.      <strong>Trend:</strong> Hand-held "garden vacs" for home      use are likely to appear in the near future.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Booming bio-control.</strong> More and more      commercial greenhouse growers are using beneficial insects      to control pests. In turn, supply houses for bio-controls      are springing up from coast to coast.      <strong>Trend:</strong> Bio-control techniques will become      the rule, rather than the exception, in both commercial and      private greenhouses. Eventually these methods will even be      used in homes and offices with indoor plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mushrooming mushrooms.</strong> Interest in growing      unusual types of mushrooms (especially shiitakes) is      burgeoning. There are now a number of companies dedicated      to providing spawn for exotic mushrooms, and there is much      research on highly intensive indoor production techniques.      <strong>Trend:</strong> Do-it-yourself mushroom growing has      developed into big business!    </p>    <p>      A few "quick takes":    </p>    <p>      <strong>Trend:</strong> Fabric ("floating") row covers,      created to extend the growing season, have turned out to be      so effective at screening out insect pests that they're      becoming almost indispensable for pesticide-free gardening.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Trend:</strong> Volunteers in the Master Gardener      program will continue to become more numerous and      proficient, helping budget-strapped Extension Services      provide topnotch aid to home gardeners in more and more      states.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Trend:</strong> Sadly, practical, grower-oriented      horticultural research at land-grant universities is being      largely replaced by high-tech, industry-oriented      biotechnology research.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Trend:</strong> The discovery that some      temperate-zone plants flourish indoors just as well as the      standby tropical species do has the potential to      "redecorate" homes and offices.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Trend:</strong> Now that it's been shown that      pesticidal mineral oils <em>don't</em> damage most      ornamental plants when used during the growing season,      these effective insect controls will be enthusiastically      adopted.    </p>    <p>      <em>Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their food on a      small farm and publish</em> Hort Ideas, <em>a fine      newsletter on gardening</em> <em>research and products ($15      a year from G. & P.
