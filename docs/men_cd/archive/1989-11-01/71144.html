                <p><strong>      EARTH DIARY</strong>    </p>        <p>      Having a whale of a time at the annual IWC meeting.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      -By Tom Turner    </h5>    <p>      <strong>THE INTERNATIONAL WHALING</strong>Commission (IWC)      met in early June at the Hyatt Island a hotel in San Diego.      This marks the first time the commission has held its      annual meeting in this country in nearly 20 years. Back      then, the United States was still killing whales, as were      perhaps two dozen other countries. Now, with a few      exceptions, killing whales is illegal. That could change,      as soon as next year.    </p>        <p>      The hotel sits on Mission Bay, a strangely artificial      estuary manicured from the former delta of the San Diego      River. The banks are rip rapped, with occasional stretches      of sand beach. Neither a native plant nor a weed grows for      miles around. (San Diego must employ as many gardeners as      Hollywood does hairdressers.) The 15-story tower of the      hotel dominates the landscape for miles.    </p>    <p>      Commissioners trickle in over the weekend, joining      scientists who have been conferring and wrangling for two      weeks. Along with representatives from member nations come      observers from nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) like      Greenpeace, the International Foundation for Animal      Welfare, and the Humane Society of the United States. Many      of these people have been attending IWC meetings since      whale conservation became a popular cause among      conservationists and wildlife enthusiasts in the early      1970s.    </p>    <p>      Sidney Holt is the patriarch of the whale savers. He's a      marine biologist-white haired, rosy cheeked, British, and      blunt-spoken. Holt has been studying whales and fighting      for their protection for three decades.    </p>    <p>      At a press conference at the opening of the meeting, Holt      stares grim-faced into a bank of television cameras. "Ten      years ago we argued that whaling should stop because the      whales were in danger of extinction. I'm not sure I      actually believed that then. I do now."    </p>    <p>      When the commission decreed an end to commercial      whaling-the moratorium was issued in 1982, to take      effect at the end of the 1985 season-- the scientists' best      guesses had put the population of fin whales in the      Antarctic at 100,000, down from an estimated 500,000 before      whaling began in earnest last century. The new data      released by Holt indicate there may be only 4,000 fin      whales in those waters.    </p>        <p>      The story of the blue whale is worse: When that animal was      protected from killing in 1965, scientists thought there      were something like 11,000 left of an original population      of around 250,000. "Now we think the blue whales number      somewhere between 200 and 1,100-probably around 500,"      Holt said. "In seven years, shipboard observers saw 23      schools of blue whales. A school of blue whales is one      whale, sometimes two. In seven years, covering more than      40,000 miles of ocean, the observers saw around 30 blue      whales. That's all."    </p>    <p>      Across the road from the Islandia the NGO's are gathering.      In addition to those mentioned above are journalists from      Friends of the Earth and Earth Island Institute, who will      publish a newsletter that reports the day's news. That's in      direct contravention of the IWC's rules, which ban      reporters from all but the opening and closing ceremonies.    </p>    <p>      This uninvited newspapering began in 1972 at the United      Nations' historic environmental conference in Stockholm.      The present series will make up volume 47. This year, for      the first time, the newspaper staff is using computers and      desktop publishing programs, which will supplant a half      dozen volunteers who used to work half the night typing and      retyping stories and creating headlines by rubbing letters      one at a time off plastic sheets.    </p>    <p>      At five o'clock Sunday afternoon, 40 observers arrange      themselves in a small motel room to plan strategy. David      McTaggart, the chairman and founder of Greenpeace, fidgets      in the comer, trying to keep the conversation on track.      McTaggart is one of the shrewdest politicians in the      international environmental arena --a recent chum, it's      rumored, of Mikhail Gorbachev. He's short, tan, and fit.      He's past 60 but could pass for 40. Easily.    </p>    <p>      The prominent issue at this year's meeting is expected to      be an attempt by Japan to evade the moratorium by creating      a new category of whaling that is somewhere between      commercial whaling (which is illegal at present) and      aboriginal whaling (which natives in Alaska, Siberia, and      Greenland carry on legally). Japan wants the commission to      recognize and approve what it calls "small type      whaling"whaling conducted in small boats from coastal      villages. Though many of the whale supporters express      sympathy with the littoral dwellers who have had to stop      whaling, none shows any sign of supporting a quota for      them.    </p>    <p>      Japanese scientists have already admitted that more than      one-third of the area's population of Dall's      porpoises-nearly 40,000 animals-was killed last      year, and hint that the blame belongs to the IWC for      imposing the moratorium. People mutter about blackmail.    </p>    <p>      "Scientific," or "research," whaling is expected to      generate some angry words as well. Since the moratorium      became effective, Japan, Norway, and Iceland have issued      per mits to themselves to kill whales for research (all      perfectly legal under the IWC's most accommodating rules).      Roger Payne, who gave the whale conservationists an      immeasurable boost fifteen years ago when he released the      record "Songs of the Humpback Whale," is utterly scornful      of this practice.    </p>        <p>      "The boats are the same, the whalers are the same. They      work for the same companies; they sell the meat to the same      people. This isn't science; it's commercial whaling by      another name. There's nothing important you can learn from      a dead whale that you can't learn from a live one," Payne      tells several hundred people gathered on the lawn outside      the meeting. Country Joe McDonald, natty in red shirt and      white Panama hat, listens attentively, awaiting his turn to      sing.    </p>    <p>      At the back of room 624 in the Dana Inn, nearly hidden      behind a bank of pale gray boxes that issue faintly purring      noises, sits a man with lemon-custard-colored hair with jet      black roots. He is David Rinehart, production expert and      computer nerd. The first issue of the newsletter, ECO, is      getting its pajamas on. Soon, two people speed into the      night to deliver artwork to the printer.    </p>    <p>      A head appears around the door jamb, offering to read      proof. "Now is not the time to proofread," says Rinehart      solemnly. "Now is the time to drink beer."    </p>    <p>      The commission's meeting proceeds deliberately. There are      subtle shifts of power evident, as when St. Lucia sides      with Japan on a procedural vote and France abstains. The      conservationists won the moratorium in 1982 by recruiting      new members for the commission in the early '80s-membership      rose from 15 to 40 in that period, with most of the      newcomers joining to crusade against whaling. Now, many of      the late joiners are interested in other matters and have      stopped paying their dues. Only 27 nations sent delegations      to this year's meeting, and several of them said they would      not return next year, partly because dues are going up 45%.      The attrition is entirely from the antiwhaling bloc, which      has conserv ationists worried.    </p>    <p>      The meeting eventually draws to a close Friday afternoon,      with no resolution of anything. The commission has again      deplored the scientific whaling programs of Norway,      Iceland, and Japan, but in such a way that has the NGO's      uneasy. The denunciation seems less fervent than in past      years, tepid enough for the Japanese whalers' public      relations specialist, Alan Macnow of New York City, to      claim victory in one of his daily press releases. (Yes,      spin doctoring has arrived at the IWC.) Macnow is      representing an NGO himself this year: Friends of Whalers.      It has one member. Alan Macnow.    </p>    <p>      The postmortem finds the conservationist observers subdued.      It's going to be difficult next year to fend off requests      from Japan, Norway, and Iceland for permits to kill a few      hundred minke whales, the last of the oceans' whales that      are still abundant.    </p>    <p>      The conservationists break down into two groups: One thinks      no whale should be killed no matter how plentiful its race;      another thinks a modest harvest is tolerable, so long as      the survival of the species is not endangered. Committees      are formed. Meetings are planned. Next year's IWC meeting      will be in the Netherlands, and the following year's in      Iceland-definitely hostile territory. The long,      grinding battle to save the whale continues. The question      is, have we already waited too long?    </p>    <p>      <em>Tom Turner, a writer and editor with more than 20      years' experience in the environmental field, is staff      writer for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, an      independent environmental law firm that represents</em>      <em>many organizations across the country.
