                    <p>      Taking personal responsibility and action to reduce ozone      depletion. By Alex Wilson    </p>        <p>      <strong>MOST OF US ARE MORE THAN</strong>Willing to make a      few changes in lifestyle if it's good for the environment.      We're learning to get by without pesticides in the garden.      More and more we drive relatively energy-efficient cars.      Surveys show that most of us would even be willing to pay a      little more on our electric bills if doing so would help      reduce acid rain. But wha t about ozone depletion? We've      heard a lot about CFCs, or chlo rofluorocarbons, and their      destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer. How can      we minimize our use of these chemicals?    </p>    <p>      Chances are you're a pretty big user of CFCs. Eighty      percent of cars sold in the U.S. have air conditioners      - the largest single source of CFC release into the      atmosphere. You almost certainly have a refrigerator in      your home, with one type of CFC used as the refrigerant      fluid and another in the insulation. If you've done any      construction in the last few years, you probably used foam      insulation and cans of spray-foam sealant containing CFCs      - particularly if you were building an      energy-efficient house. CFCs are also used in foam      cushions, packaging materials, cleaning fluids for      electronic equipment, some aerosol propellants, and many      consumer products such as boat horns, tire inflators, and      Dust-Off for cleaning camera lenses. This article will      review where CFCs are used around the home and business and      describe some of the alternatives currently available or      under development.    </p>    <p>      <em>CFC's take years to reach the stratosphere, where they      destroy<br />      the UV-shilding ozone layer.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>Fig. 1:</em> <em>UV light breaks a chlorine atom off a      CFC molecule. The chlorine reacts with ozone (O 3 ),      forming molecular oxygen (O 2 ) and chlorine monoxide. The      oxygen is pulled off that molecule by a free oxygen atom,      leaving the chlorine atom to start the process all over      again.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Ozone Depletion    </h3>    <p>      Concerns over ozone have generated quite a bit of confusion      in recent years. Ozone is a bad guy at ground level, where      high levels present a serious pollution problem in most      major cities. But the same compound, a form of oxygen, is a      good guy in the upper atmosphere, where it blocks out      harmful ultraviolet light. Scientists first theorized 15      years ago that man-made chemicals could break down the      protective ozone layer. Their warnings led to a ban of CFC      aerosols in this country in 1978. After taking that action,      we pretty much forgot about ozone depletion and CFCs for 10      years. All that complacency vanished, however, after      scientists discovered a large hole in the ozone layer over      Antarctica in 1985.    </p>    <p>      The ozone hole over Antarctica, and now a thinning of the      ozone layer above the Arctic, has led to worldwide action      to curtail the use of the primary culprits: CFCs and      related compounds called halons. These chemicals introduce      chlorine and several other reactive elements into the      stratosphere 15 to 50 kilometers above the earth's surface.      There, the chlorine ions react with ozone, breaking off one      of the three oxygen atoms and forming a transition      compound, chlorine monoxide, and molecular oxygen (see Fig.      1). The chlorine monoxide in turn reacts with another ozone      molecule, repeating the process. A single chlorine atom can      break down tens of thousands of ozone molecules in this      manner.    </p>    <p>      Because ozone blocks out harmful ultraviolet light, the      resultant thinning of the ozone layer is a big concern to      life on earth. With the protective barrier gone,      high-energy UV-B radiation reaches earth, where it could      wreak havoc. Among the human health effects of UV-B      radiation are acute sunburn, skin cancer, cataracts and      other eye disorders, and possible suppression of the immune      system. UV-B radiation could also reduce agricultural crop      yields, kill organisms in the highly productive top layer      of the ocean, exacerbate smog in some urban areas, and      speed the degradation of paints, plastics, and other      manmade materials.    </p>    <p>      CFCs are able to introduce chlorine to the stratosphere      primarily because the chemicals are so stable. Most gaseous      compounds readily break down within a period of days or      weeks when released into the air, but CFCs are highly      stable-some lasting more than 100 years. Over a period of      years or decades, winds carry the CFCs up into the      stratosphere, where the high-energy UV-B radiation has      enough power to break them apart, as described.    </p>    <p>      Ironically, it is this tremendous stability that made CFCs      such valuable industrial chemicals. Being stable, they      don't react with refrigerator coils or electronic circuit      boards, they remain nonflammable, and they are nontoxic. On      top of that, they are inexpensive to produce and exhibit a      wide range of highly desirable properties for use in      manufacturing and refrigeration. As an example of the      durability of these chemicals, a refrigerator charged with      CFC refrigerant in the 1950s could still be using the same      fluid today, more than 30 years later. Because of this, the      CFC industry, which was born around 1920, grew into a      multibillion-dollar industry by the 1980s, with 700 million      pounds produced in 1986.    </p>    <p>      Intense concern over ozone depletion and CFCs has led to      unprecedented international action to reduce the production      and use of CFCs and halons (which are used in fire      extinguishing systems). In September 1987, 24 nations and      the European Economic Community met in Montreal and signed      a treaty, Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. The      agreement, which took effect after the necessary number of      countries ratified it, limits annual consumption of five      CFCs (CFC11, -12, -113, -114, and -115) to 1986 levels      starting July 1, 1989. This represents about a 20%      reduction from 1988 levels, because of recent growth in CFC      use. Reductions to 80% and 50% of 1986 levels will occur in      1993 and 1998, respectively. Helena are regulated      separately from CFCs. Starting in 1992, halon consumption      will be frozen at 1986 levels.    </p>    <p>      <em>Some CFC refrigerant</em> <em>installed in the 1950s      could still be in use today.</em>    </p>    <p>      Following this action, several European nations and the      United States have called for total phaseout of CFCs by the      year 2000. In the U.S. there are several bills in Congress      that would accomplish a phaseout by 2000 or even sooner.      One of the big questions that remains is whether other      compounds will be added to the restrictions. The HCFCs,      including HCFC-22, which is currently available, are much      less damaging to the ozone, but they do exhibit some      ozone-depletion effects-between 3 and 7% that of CFC-11 and      -12. Many of the replacements being investigated by      chemical companies are in this class of compounds.    </p>    <p>      In addition to destroying the protective ozone layer, CFCs      are also greenhouse gases. They trap outgoing heat from the      earth's surface even more effectively than carbon      dioxide-the number one offender. Had there been no      constraints placed on CFC aerosol use in the late '70s,      some experts claim that CFCs would today account for more      global warming potential than CO 2 !    </p>    <h3>      Finding Alternatives    </h3>    <p>      Finding alternatives to CFCs involves first figuring out      which products use the chemicals. That isn't always easy.      Table 1 lists the most common CFC and halon compounds,      along with their relative ozone-depletion effects,      quantities produced, and uses. To help you figure out      whether a particular product contains one of the more      harmful CFCs or halons, the chemical names you might find      on a label are given. But unless you have a degree in      organic chemistry, you may have some trouble even reading      the names, let alone recognizing them.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>It's not always easy to determine which      products use<br />      ozone-depleting chemicals.</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      The next problem you'll encounter is that not all products      manufactured with CFCs are identified as such. Rigid foam      insulation and flexible foam, for example, do not list the      foaming agents. Several pieces of legislation currently      under consideration would require manufacturers to clearly      identify products that contain ozone-harmful CFCs.    </p>    <p>      The following paragraphs cover the most common products      using CFCs. The information should help you both to      identify those products and materials using CFCs and to      find alternatives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Insulation</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most rigid-board insulation is produced with CFC-11 or -12      as the blowing agent. Injected into the foam as a liquid      during manufacturing, the CFC boils, causing gas bubbles to      form in the curing foam. The cured foam has bubbles of CFC      gas throughout. A major benefit of CFC-produced insulation      is that CFCs do not conduct heat as quickly as air does, so      the R-value is higher. You get more insulation in a thinner      layer. As a result, CFC-foamed insulation materials have      grown tremendously in popularity over the past 20 years.      Insulation accounts for about 30% of the CFCs used each      year.    </p>        <p>      Common insulation materials are listed in Table 2. You can      see that most rigid insulation boards are produced with      CFCs, including urethane, polyisocyanurate, phenolic foam,      and <em>extruded</em> polystyrene. Foam-in-place urethane      insulation is also produced with CFCs. The only      insulation-board materials that don't contain CFCs are      <em>expanded</em> polystyrene (commonly called EPS or      beadboard) and rigid fiberglass. Batt and loose-fill      insulation materials such as fiberglass, rock wool,      cellulose, and perlite don't contain CFCs.    </p>    <p>      The distinction between extruded polystyrene and EPS needs      clarification. Both have the same chemical base (styrene),      but production differs. With EPS, tiny beads of styrene are      mixed with pentane and are expanded (much like popcorn),      The expanded beads are molded into large blocks that are      then sawn into boardstock. With extruded polystyrene, on      the other hand, the styrene is mixed with CFC-12 and      injected in an extruding machine. The CFC expands the sty      rene in one continuous board rather than in separate beads.      Extruded polystyrene generally has higher density, greater      compressive strength, and higher R-value.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Alternatives to CFC-containing</strong></em>      <strong><em>insulation are on the way but will be more      expensive.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      To attain high energy efficiency in homes without using      CFC-containing insulation requires building thicker walls.      Instead of using 2 X 4s, for example, framing can be done      with 2 X 6s (or, for super-insulated buildings, 2 X 8s or      double 2 X 4s), and the foam sheathing eliminated. Even      though the walls will be thicker than a comparably      insulated house with CFC-foam insulation, the cost is often      lower because fiberglass and cellulose insulation are less      expensive than rigid foam.    </p>    <p>      If you want to use rigid insulation, stick with expanded      polystyrene or rigid fiberglass. EPS is produced in dozens      of factories around the country, though it isn't readily      available in building supply centers. When ordering EPS,      you can usually specify a higher-density product that will      insulate better and provide greater compressive strength,      though the cost will also be higher. Rigid fiberglass for      wall sheathing, unfortunately, is not readily available in      this country, though a few companies import a product from      Canada.    </p>    <p>      Within several years, the foam insulation industry expects      to have eliminated CFCs from all foam insulation. Making      that change is easier with some products than with others.      With extruded polystyrene, the change is relatively easy.      In fact, Dow Chemical, the manufacturer of Styrofoam-brand      extruded polystyrene, has begun shifting plants over from a      process using CFC-12 to one using a less ozone-destructive      HCFC foaming agent that is commercially available. Doug      Draper, a spokesman for the company, said Dow has already      converted two of their six U.S. plants and expects to      complete all conversions by mid-1990.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, there are currently no commercially      available replacements for the CFC-11 used in urethane-,      polyisocyanurate-, and phenolic-foam insulation. CFC      manufacturers are investigating several promising      alternatives, including HCFC123 and HCFC-141b, but they      won't complete toxicity and durability testing for these      chemicals for another three to five years. Also, even when      available, these newer HCFCs are expected to be      considerably more expensive than the CFCs they'll replace.      Higher production costs will make HCFCproduced insulation      even less competitive with fiberglass and cellulose on a      cost-per-R-value basis.    </p>    <h3>      Foam Sealants    </h3>    <p>      Spray-foam sealants are among the most exciting products to      come along in the construction industry in the past decade.      These aerosol sprays are used to set window and door frames      tightly into place and to seal electrical penetrations and      other cracks and gaps around the house. The urethane      insulation bonds extremely well with most surfaces and has      played an important role in helping builders to produce      very tight, energy-efficient homes.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, all foam sealants relied on CFCs as the      foaming agent. Within the past year, however, two      manufacturers have come out with non-CFC foam sealants.      Convenience Products, Inc. (4205 Forest Park Blvd., St.      Louis, MO 63108; 314/349-5333) recently introduced a      sealant, Touch 'n Foam Ozone Safe, that uses a hydrocarbon      foaming agent. While flammable during foaming and for      several hours after, the hydrocarbon evaporates, and the      cured foam is comparable in fire safety to CFC-foamed      urethanes. The cured foam will not have as high an R-value,      but that shouldn't make much difference in a sealant      application.    </p>    <p>      Todol Products, Inc. (P.O. Box 398, Natick, MA O 1760;      508/879-7741) last year introduced a European product,      Pur-Fil, which uses an HCFC foaming agent that's      considerably less harmful to the ozone. Like their older      CFC-foamed product, this one contains no hydrocarbons and      so doesn't pose any fire concern.    </p>    <p>      If you have an application for spray-foam sealant, look      carefully through the products at your building supply      center. The foaming agent may not be clearly listed. If you      don't see specific mention on the can that the product is      ozone-safe, however, assume it contains CFCs.    </p>    <h3>      Refrigerators    </h3>    <p>      Refrigerators pose a unique problem in efforts to reduce      the use of CFCs. They rely upon CFCs in two very important      ways: first, as the circulating refrigerant used in the      compressor cycle to cool the refrigerator; and second, in      the urethane foam used to insulate it. CFC-12 has been the      refrigerant of choice for decades. It has an excellent      record of performance and can provide the necessary cooling      for both the refrigerator and freezer compartments.    </p>    <p>      Because homeowners want as much inside volume as possible      while maintaining outside dimensions that will still fit      into the kitchen, space is at a premium in refrigerators.      Therefore, insulating with five- or six-inch-thick walls is      just not acceptable, according to manufacturers.    </p>    <p>      Efforts to find alternatives are progressing rapidly in the      refrigerator industry, but experts say the changes will      take a lot of time, and high efficiency may be difficult to      maintain. HCFC-22 is used in commercial chillers but isn't      effective for achieving temperatures below about 15°F.      Efforts are underway to develop a two-stage compressor      system that would enable HCFC-22 to be used in residential      refrigerator-freezers. More attention is focusing on new      refrigerants. HCFC-134a is considered a likely candidate to      replace CFC-12, but it will be at least three to five years      before the new refrigerant is on the market-assuming      it passes testing. Even then, using it will require some      changes in compressor design.    </p>    <p>      More radical refrigeration technologies are also being      considered. Some suggest a return to ammonia as the      refrigerant (used in very early refrigerators), but ammonia      leaks would be smelly and potentially dangerous. One      company, Cryodynamics, Inc. of Mountainside, New Jersey, is      developing a Stirling-cycle cooling system using helium.      Company president Dr. Steven Malaker claims that his      technology, which has been used in specialized medical      applications for some time, will be simpler, 25% more      energy efficient, and no more expensive.    </p>    <p>      On the insulation side, the most exciting development is      the prospect of vacuum-panel insulation. Various companies      and research institutes are pursuing several different      vacuum-panel technologies. One approach is a hard vacuum      like that in a thermos bottle (10-6 torr -about a      billionth of an atmosphere). A 1/8-inch-thick panel of this      type could insulate to R-15. By doubling or tripling the      layers, insulation levels could be further increased, and      edge losses kept to a minimum. A non-CFC foam insulation      might be used with such a system to protect the vacuum      panel and provide rigidity. But even with a layer of foam      insulation, the total wall thickness could be less than      what is found in today's refrigerators, and the R-value      more than double present standards.    </p>    <p>      Another approach is a soft-vacuum powder insulation. With      this technology, a very fine silica powder is put in      airtight panels, and a soft vacuum (1/100 to 1/1000 of an      atmosphere) is drawn in the panel. Heat transfer from      particle to particle in the powder is greatly reduced, and      R-values up to R-25 per inch are possible. General Electric      holds several patents on this technology, as do several      other companies. In fact, one Japanese company, Matsushita      Electric, had a refrigerator on the market four years ago      with this type of insulation (the product has since been      discontinued). Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory      measured the R-value at R-18 per inch.    </p>    <p>      Finally, a California company, Quantum Optics, is      developing a vacuum-insulation technology in which      monolithic silica aerogel-an unusual solid that is 80      to 90% air-is injected into sealed panels, and a soft      vacuum drawn. Like the powder vacuum, this can insulate far      better than the best CFC-based insulation materials. Silica      aerogel and hard-vacuum panel technologies are not as close      to commercialization as the softvacuum powder technology.    </p>    <p>      Until new refrigeration and insulation technologies can be      developed and brought to market, refrigerator manufacturers      are caught in a bind. A new-appliance efficiency bill was      signed into law in 1987 that mandates higher efficiency      standards in 1990 and again in 1993. When the law passed,      refrigerator manufacturers thought they would be able to      meet the higher efficiency requirements in part by using      larger quantities of CFCs. Without increasing their CFC      use, they will still be able to meet the 1990 standards,      but the industry is lobbying hard to prevent still higher      efficiency standards from going into effect in 1993. The      industry supports the gradual phaseout of CFCs but wants to      delay new energy-efficiency standards.    </p>    <p>      One observer remarked sardonically that if the refrigerator      industry had been running the Manhattan Project during      World War II, we might still be a nuclear-free world. The      same argument could be turned around to suggest that      because ozone depletion and global warming problems are so      great, they warrant a huge national research effort      addressing energy efficiency and CFC alternatives-one on      the scale of the project that resulted in the atomic bomb.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Auto air conditioners are the single largest      source of CFC release into the atmosphere.</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      Auto Air-Conditioning    </h3>    <p>      Auto air conditioners account for about a quarter of the      total CFCs pumped into the atmosphere each year in the      United States. Eighty percent of new cars in this country      come with air conditioners, and the compressor required for      a midsize American car is equivalent in capacity to the one      required for whole-house cooling in Atlanta, Georgia! Rapid      cool-down calls for such a workhorse. Once the car's      interior is cool, the system is way oversized.    </p>    <p>      Auto air conditioners use CFC-12 exclusively, as they have      since the mid-50s. HCFC-22 was used for a while in some      cars, but the required compressor has to operate under      higher pressure, which demands heavier components. Because      less weight is so desirable in cars, CFC-12 won out as the      refrigerant of choice.    </p>    <p>      Manufacturers are anxiously awaiting the availability of      HCFC-134a, but that is still several years away, assuming      successful toxicity and durability testing. In the      meantime, a tremendous reduction in CFC-12 venting to the      atmosphere is possible by servicing air-conditioning      systems at facilities that can reclaim the old CFC rather      than simply letting it evaporate. With conventional      practices, servicing and charging air conditioners release      20 to 25% of the CFC-12 into the air. Equipment to capture      and reclaim CFC during servicing is just being certified by      national testing labs and should begin appearing in service      stations very soon. If your auto air conditioner needs      servicing, ask the service station personnel if they have      such equipment. If they don't, try to find a station that      does. "This is the single largest opportunity for consumers      to make a difference," says Steve Andersen, who heads much      of the CFC work at the Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA).    </p>    <p>      An interesting development under way that could greatly      reduce the necessary size of auto air conditioners (and the      amount of CFC refrigerant required) involves      photovoltaic-powered (solar electric) ventilation systems.      When cars are parked in the sun, a PV panel built right      into the car roof could power a ventilation fan, pulling      hot air out of the car. Because most of the air      conditioner's capacity is required solely for rapid      cool-down when the car has been parked in the sun, such      systems could save the auto industry millions in cost for      such large air conditioners while reducing CFC use      considerably.    </p>    <h3>      Foam Packaging Materials    </h3>    <p>      Amid a lot of fairly discouraging news about CFCs and the      lack of currently available alternatives, foam packaging      provides a bright spot. Already, the food packaging      industry has eliminated the use of CFCs. That means when      you pick up your burger and fries and a hot cup of coffee      at your favorite fast-food spot, you're no longer using a      product containing CFCs. (Of course, you're still adding to      the solid waste problem, but that's another story.) The      food packaging industry deserves tremendous credit for      moving so quickly and effectively to eliminate CFCs from      their products.    </p>    <p>      Similarly, most other foam packaging materials no longer      contain CFCs. Dow Chemical, which manufactures      Pelaf-PanPac, the so-called "plastic peanut" used in      packaging, will have eliminated their use of CFCs in the      product by the end of 1989, according to company spokesman      Doug Draper. With another product, Ethafoam - the      molded solid white foam used for packaging electronic      equipment-the company has already eliminated 75% of the CFC      use and will eliminate it altogether by mid-1990.    </p>    <h3>      Flexible Foam Padding    </h3>    <p>      Some flexible foam padding used in cushions, mattresses,      and other consumer products is made with CFCs. This      accounts for about 5% of CFC use in this country.      Unfortunately, just by looks alone it's very hard to tell      which flexible foam is made with CFCs and which is not. In      general, the CFC padding is softer and cheaper than, and      generally inferior to, non-CFC padding. You're likely to      find it in bottom-of-the-line chairs and sofas, for      example. In fact, the flexible-foam industry refers to      CFC-based flexible foam as "junk foam." CFC foams don't      last as long as the quality products, so in a way it's a      service to consumers to get rid of CFCs, according to      Andersen of the EPA.    </p>    <p>      Eliminating CFC use in flexible foam is relatively easy,      and it's happening naturally as the cost of CFCs goes up.      Within a few years, even without further regulations, CFC      use in padding is likely to all but disappear.    </p>    <h3>      Electronics and Lens Cleaning    </h3>    <p>      CFCs have long been used as solvents for cleaning      electronic circuit boards and as pressurized gases for      cleaning lenses, because they are easily compressed, are      nontoxic, and leave no residue. These applications      accounted for about 24% of CFC use in the U.S. in 1985, but      that figure is dropping quickly. In industry, companies are      turning to aqueous cleaning solutions, alcohol-based      cleaners, diluted CFC cleaning solutions, new HCFC      chemicals, and manufacturing processes that do not require      cleaning.    </p>    <p>      On the consumer level, electronic hobbyists can still buy      CFC circuit-board-cleaning solutions, but non-CFC products      should work as well or almost as well. Ask your electronic      equipment salesperson about available cleaning products.      For photographers, small cans of CFC-based DustOff      lens-cleaning products are still widely available in camera      and electronic stores, but so are non-CFC alternatives.      Look at these products carefully before buying. Alternative      products using compressed air or CO, should be available.    </p>    <h3>      Miscellaneous Consumer Products    </h3>    <p>      Along with the above-mentioned CFC-based products, there      are several specialized consumer products that use CFCs.      These include boat horns, tire inflators, cartridge-type      pellet guns, and devices to chill cocktail glasses. In all      cases, alternative non-CFC products are readily available      - and often more common. The trick is to be able to      figure out which use CFCs and which do not. Whenever      possible, select the non-CFC products.    </p>    <h3>      Conclusions    </h3>    <p>      Your effect on global ozone depletion may seem      insignificant, but individual actions do make a tremendous      difference. As a case in point, by the time the 1978 ban on      CFC aerosols took effect, use of such products had already      dropped 70% Consumers didn't want to use a product that      might harm the environment, and industry responded. Each of      us can wield the same power today.    </p>    <p>      Finding alternatives to many of the remaining      CFC-containing products may not be as easy as it was when      CFCs were taken out of aerosols, but if consumers demand      them, alternatives will be found. Even refrigerator      manufacturers will find replacements-and those new      technologies might be far more energy efficient than what      we have today, saving consumers billions of dollars yearly      in energy bills. As the adage goes, Where there is a      problem, there is an opportunity. Ozone depletion is      clearly a problem. All of us have a role to play in solving      it, and the solution may actually help to solve other      problems, such as global warming.    </p>    <p>      The United States currently accounts for approximately 30      to 35% of the world's CFC production and use. As with      energy, we are big consumers. As a result, our actions have      tremendous global significance. This is all the more reason      for us, as Americans, to act quickly.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the best news to come out of the ozone depletion      crisis is that it has brought nations together as never      before to deal with an international environmental problem.      This cooperation could serve as a model for action on other      international problems such as global warming and pollution      of our oceans. Out of it, perhaps, we will not only solve a      few of these pressing concerns, but also usher in a new era      of international cooperation and communication.    </p>    <p>      <em>Alex Wilson is a freelance writer in Brattleboro,      Vermont, who specializes in energy and environmental      issues.</em>    </p>    <h3>      BALANCING OZONE DEPLETING AND GLOBAL WARMING    </h3>    <p>      As WE ATTEMPT TO ELIMINATE CFCs from insulation materials,      we need to keep energy efficiency in mind. Simply replacing      CFC insulation with the same thickness of fiberglass, or      with EPS having half the R-value, will necessitate burning      more fossil fuel for heat. Such combustion releases carbon      dioxide into the atmosphere, where it's the number one      contributor to the greenhouse effect and global warming.    </p>    <p>      Maintaining a global environmental awareness necessitates      keeping these two sometimes contradictory efforts in      balance. A follow-up article in the April 1990 issue of      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> will address global warming and energy      efficiency, demonstrating the relationship between energy      savings and reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. As is      the case with CFCs this is another area in which every one      of us can-and must-play a part in maintaining a livable      environment.    </p>
