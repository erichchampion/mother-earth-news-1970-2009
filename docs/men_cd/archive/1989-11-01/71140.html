            <p>      Issue # 120 - November/December 1989    </p>    <p>      KITCHEN GARDEN    </p>        <p><strong>A type for every taste.</strong></p>    <h5 id="byline">      - By Sara Pacher    </h5>    <p>      <strong>THE WORLD HAS BEEN BLESSED</strong> with beans.      There are more than 500 cultivated varieties, with origins      as diverse as Japan, India, Central America, and the      Mediterranean. Botanically speaking, the greatest number of      bean varieties belong to the genus <em>Phaseolus,</em>      which includes green and wax beans (covered in issue No.      118), as well as kidney, pinto, and lima beans. Mung beans      and adzuki beans, however, belong to the genus      <em>Vigna;</em> fava beans are classed as <em>Vicia      faba,</em> garbanzos as <em>Cicer arietinum;</em> and the      soybean has the botanical name of Gly <em>cine max.</em> A      shell bean can be considered as any bean grown for the bean      itself-the seed-rather than the pod.    </p>        <h3>      What to Grow    </h3>    <p>      With such diverse choices, it can be exceedingly rewarding      to grow shell beans you might not have tried before. (Check      with your county extension agent to find out if a      particular variety will do well in your area.) Here are a      few favorites:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Adzuki beans,</strong> natives of Japan, feature      small plants with long, thin pods that when young can be      eaten like snap beans. Each pod contains seven to 10 small,      nutty-tasting, maroon-colored seeds, which require a lot of      shelling but are extremely high in protein and are      excellent fresh or dried. (In Asia, they are often used in      desserts.) Adzukis require a three-month growing season,but      they are resistant to pests, even Mexican bean beetles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Black beans</strong> (also called black turtle      beans) were a staple of the Inca and Aztec diets      and-combined with rice-are still a favorite in      parts of Central and South America. Because black beans      need 85 to 105 warm, frost-free days to mature, they are      popular in the South, where they are eaten mainly in soups      and stews. These jet black seeds come from sprawling      half-runner-type plants, but some newer      varieties, such as Johnny's Midnight Black Turtle Soup,      have more upright growth habits.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Garbanzo beans</strong> (also known as chickpeas)      are nutty-tasting dry beans that can be baked, though I      prefer them cooked and chilled for use in salads.      Unfortunately, these bushy plants, which need 65 to 100      days to produce a harvest, don't do well in cooler      climates.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fava beans</strong> (also called broad, English,      Windsor, horse, or cattle beans) are among our oldest      cultivated vegetables, having been found in archaeological      sites in Europe, North Africa, and China. As a source of      vegetable protein, they are second only to soybeans. In      addition, like other beans, they are rich in fiber,      potassium, iron, calcium, and vitamins A and C. It's said      this nutritious legume was an ingredient in the hardtack      recipe given by God to Ezekiel when warning of the      disasters awaiting Jerusalem. Egyptian priests, though,      regarded the beans as unclean, and the ancient philosopher      Pythagoras blamed them for insomnia and bad dreams.      (Perhaps the Greek suffered from favism, a rare inherited      allergy to broad beans that occurs mostly in males of      Mediterranean descent.) Nevertheless, broad beans remained      a European favorite and helped many peasants of medieval      England to survive. In this country, however, they're grown      mostly for fodder. For this reason, there's a limited      number of the more delicately flavored garden varieties      available here, but you'll find that the types you do      locate are very easy to grow. Favas, which generally take      75 days to mature, actually thrive in cold, damp weather.      They should, in fact, be planted around the same time as      peas, since production fades in summer's heat.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>If legumes are heavily fertilized, they produce      lush leaves but few beans.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Young fava beans, pod and all, are sometimes cooked like      green beans, and the beans themselves can be cooked fresh      from the pods like peas. Usually, though, mature beans are      shelled from pods dried on the vine and are cooked like      lima beans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Great northern white beans,</strong> though usually      dried for baked dishes, can, in short-season areas, be      harvested as a green shell bean in only 65 days. The      bush-type plants are very high-yielding.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Horticultural beans</strong> (also called shell,      wren's egg, bird egg, speckled cranberry, or October beans)      come in both pole and dwarf varieties and can produce big      harvests in small gardens. The colorful, mottled pods can      be eaten like snap beans when young, but most people prefer      to use the rich, nutty, red-speckled seeds, which mature in      65 to 70 days, as fresh shell beans and for canning and      freezing. Some Southerners claim horticultural beans are      best after the pods begin to turn slightly dry or "shucky."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lima beans</strong> (known as butter beans or      butter peas in the South) probably originated in Guatemala      but were first shipped to Europe from Lima, Peru, and take      their name from that port. These warm-weather plants are      highly sensitive to chilly weather, so they must be sown      well after the last frost date. Bush varieties take two to      two and a half months to mature; pole types generally      require three months to produce a crop, but the vines grow      quickly, sometimes to as long as 30 feet! You can choose      among varieties that produce thick or flat or large or      small limas, all packed with vitamins A and C. Though these      legumes are typically green in color, there are also      speckled types.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mung beans,</strong> which can be grown in any area      that has 90 days of frost-free temperatures, produce bushy      plants up to three feet tall, sporting long, thin, hairy      pods, which when young can be cooked and eaten. Each pod      contains nine to 15 small yellow seeds. These can be used      fresh or dried. In their native India, mung beans are      cooked and pureed as a part of the daily diet. In most      other parts of the world, the dried seeds are used to      produce crispy, nutritious bean sprouts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pinto beans,</strong> best known for their use in      Mexican cuisine, are a close kin to the red kidney bean.      Their strong vines take up more space than bush-type beans,      so they are usually grown like pole beans but are allowed      to dry on the vine. A three- to four-month growing season      is required.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Red kidney beans,</strong> which require 100 days      to mature, are the most popular of dry beans, probably      because they're the easiest to grow. Their red color and      hearty flavor give life to soups, stews, chilies, and      salads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Scarlet runner beans,</strong> which take 70 days      to mature, are among my favorites. This plant is a      beautiful climbing ornamental with scarlet flowers, and it      produces black- and red-speckled seeds that can be enjoyed      fresh or dried. Also, the rough-looking green pods can be      eaten when young.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Soldier beans,</strong> whose white, oval-shaped      seeds make for a great baked dish, are well suited to cool,      dry climates. Keep in mind that the vinelike plants need      plenty of space to sprawl and 85 days to mature.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Soybeans,</strong> which are extremely high in      protein and calcium, have-in one form or another-become a      staple of the vegetarian diet. Though they lack one amino      acid, methionine, to make them a complete protein, they are      rich in lecithin, an emulsifier that breaks up large fatty      molecules into smaller ones and is thought to help control      cholesterol levels. Although soybeans were once grown in      the U.S. primarily for fodder and as a green-manure crop,      they now have wide commercial use in the production of soy      milk, oil, flour, tempeh, tofu, and meat substitutes and      extenders. In recent years, new garden varieties have been      developed that are delicious fresh or dried (try Fiskeby V,      Prize, or Okuhara). The bush-type plants are tolerant of      cool spring weather but do require a three-month growing      season.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The more plump pods you pick, the more      abundantly the vines will yield</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      How to Grow    </h3>    <p>      With the exception of favas, which can and should be      planted as soon as the soil can be worked, shell beans need      warm soil and a growing season with average temperatures      ranging from the 70s to the 80s. Regardless of variety,      beans need a well-drained soil that's rich in organic      matter and has a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Work in garden      lime if the plot is too acid, and, if needed, add      phosphorus by broadcasting 10 pounds of finely ground      phosphate rock per 100 square feet, and add potassium in      the form of granite dust or hardwood ashes (again, about 10      pounds to 100 square feet). Since legumes fix their own      nitrogen from the air, don't fertilize heavily, or you'll      get lush leaves but few beans. Lighten heavy clay with      compost and sand so seedlings can push through the soil.    </p>    <p>      If beans are planted in a plot where they haven't been      grown before, it's a good idea to inoculate the seeds with      a bacterial inoculant powder, but don't soak or presprout      them before planting, because they're susceptible to rot.      For this reason, too, bean seeds (particularly favas, which      are the largest of all vegetable seeds) aren't well suited      to soggy soil.    </p>    <p>      Long-season beans can be grown in short-season areas if      they are harvested in the green shell stage. All are      sensitive to frost except favas, which require a long, cool      growing season. Though beans, particularly limas, aren't      easy to transplant, short-season gardeners can try starting      them indoors in peat pots about four weeks before the first      frost-free date. (Disturb the roots as little as possible      when transplanting.) In warmer areas, plant directly in the      ground two weeks after the last frost or when the soil has      warmed to at least 65°-favas again being the      exception.    </p>    <p>      Sow the seeds one inch deep in heavy soil and one and a      half inches deep in light soil. Spacing requirements will      vary with the type of bean grown, but most bush varieties      are planted at three- to six-inch spacings in rows 24 to 30      inches apart. Make successive plantings of bush types every      two weeks to insure a continuous harvest. If your plot is      exposed to a lot of wind, provide the plants with support      in the form of brushy twigs, or run a strong cord around      stakes set at the row ends or in each corner of the bed.    </p>    <p>      Pole beans bear more heavily than bush beans but take      longer to mature, so they are generally planted only once,      at the beginning of the season. Space the seeds four to six      inches apart in rows two to three feet apart. Once two      seedling leaves appear, provide some means of vertical      support. When planting in hills around tipi-type poles, sow      six to eight seeds per mound, and thin later to three or      four plants.    </p>    <p>      The germination rate for beans is around 70%, and unused      seeds should remain viable for three years.    </p>    <p>      Try to maintain even moisture in the soil, especially while      the seeds are germinating and when the plants are in bloom,      because dry soil during this time will mean no flowers and      therefore no pods. Be careful when cultivating not to      damage the plants' shallow roots. (A thick mulch will help      both to conserve moisture and to keep down weeds.) And stay      out of the bean patch when the foliage is wet, to avoid      spreading disease.    </p>    <p>      In sandy soils or where repeated rains leach out nutrients,      give beans a midseason side-dressing of potassium in the      form of wood ashes or a seaweed-extract solution.    </p>    <h3>      What to Watch For    </h3>    <p>      Soybeans and adzuki and mung beans are fairly resistant to      pests. Other beans are vulnerable to aphids, cabbage      loopers, corn ear worms, striped cucumber beetles, European      corn borers, leaf miners, and-perhaps the most      destructive of all-Mexican bean beetles. Try      repelling such pests with plantings of savory, nasturtiums,      and French or African marigolds.    </p>    <p>      Discourage aphids with garlic or soap sprays, sticky traps,      diatomaceous earth, and wood ashes. Handpicking,      <em>Bacillus thuringiensis,</em> and trichogramma wasps can      control cabbage loopers and corn earworms. Handpicking,      braconid wasps, tachinid flies, and ladybugs are good      defenses against corn borers. Catnip, tansy, nasturtiums,      radishes, and goldenrod repel striped cucumber beetles.    </p>    <p>      Heavy mulching helps, too, since the beetles lay their      orange eggs in the soil near the plants. Handpick adults (a      one-fourth-inch-long, yellowish orange bug with a black      head and three black stripes running down its back) from      the undersides of leaves. Soldier beetles, tachinid flies,      braconid wasps, and certain nematodes prey on this beetle,      which spreads bacterial wilt and cucumber mosaic. Planting      later in the season may help avoid infestations.    </p>    <p>      The same preventive measure can be applied to Mexican bean      beetles. Find out when the heaviest outbreaks are likely to      occur in your area, and try to plant your crop so as to      avoid them. Also, check the plants daily for the      one-third-inch-long, yellow, spiny-looking but soft-bodied      grubs and destroy them, as well as any little clusters of      yellow eggs hidden under leaves. Alternate rows of potatoes      and beans to reduce pest populations on both crops. (This      intercropping, along with handpicking the adults, larvae,      and egg clusters, is also effective against leaf miners.)      Assassin bugs and the tiny wasp <em>Pediobius      foveolatus</em> prey on Mexican bean beetles, but for      out-of-control infestations, you'll most likely have to      resort to rotenone or pyrethrum.    </p>    <p>      Most beans, limas in particular, are susceptible to      anthracnose, bacterial blight, mosaic, and rust. Combat      these problems by buying disease-free seeds and      disease-resistant varieties, by rotating the crop every one      to two years, and by spacing plants far enough apart to      provide for air circulation. Should a disease attack,      destroy the infected plant immediately, don't touch other      plants with unwashed hands or clippers, and don't sow beans      in problem areas of the garden for at least five years      following an outbreak. In addition, remember that wet soil      not only can rot seeds but also can subject seedlings to      damping-off.    </p>    <h3>      How to Harvest and Store    </h3>    <p>      As mentioned above, you should stay out of the bean patch      when it's wet with rain or a heavy dew. Instead, choose a      sunny, dry day for harvesting. Pick shell beans for eating      fresh when the pods are plump but still tender. The more      you pick, the more the vines will produce. If even a few      beans are left to mature fully, the plants bearing them      will take this as a signal to quit.    </p>    <p>      Unshelled, the beans will keep for up to one week in the      refrigerator. Green shell beans can be canned, but it's      preferable to freeze them. To do this, blanch medium-sized      beans in water for three minutes and smaller beans for two      minutes. For steam blanching, add one minute to each. Cool      the beans, drain them well, and pack them into containers,      leaving one-half inch of head-space. Label the containers,      and freeze the beans.    </p>    <p>      Harvest dry beans when the plants have matured, the leaves      have turned completely brown, and the seeds are dry and      hard enough so they scarcely dent when bitten into. If the      pods have turned yellow and rain is in the forecast, cut      off the plants near the ground, leaving the nitrogen-fixing      roots to enrich the soil, and hang up the stalks to dry      indoors. Dried beans stored in airtight, lidded containers      set in a cool, dry place will keep for 10 to 12 months.    </p>    <h3>      Classic Black Bean Soup    </h3>    <p>      You might want to double this recipe, since the soup is      even better on the second or third day.    </p>    <p>      2 cups dried black beans<br />      2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br />      1 1/2 cups finely chopped onion<br />      1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic<br />      1 large green pepper, diced<br />      1 tablespoon oregano<br />      2 teaspoons ground cumin<br />      6 cups water<br />      5 teaspoons vinegar<br />      Salt and pepper to taste<br />      Marinated rice garnish    </p>    <p>      Cover beans with water, and soak overnight. Drain. Heat oil      in a large saucepan, and saute onion, garlic, green pepper,      oregano, and cumin for 5 minutes. Add drained beans, water,      vinegar, salt, and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat      and simmer for 1 1/2-2 hours, until beans are tender. (Add      more water during the cooking process if necessary.) Top      servings with a garnish made Of 1/2 CUP cooked rice that      has been marinated in a mixture of 1/2 cup chopped onion, 2      teaspoons olive oil, and 4 teaspoons vinegar. Serves 4-6.    </p>    <h3>      Mediterranean Salad    </h3>    <p>      Almost any cooked bean can be substituted for the ones in      this recipe.    </p>    <p>      1 head Romaine lettuce, torn in strips<br />      1 large, skinless, cooked chicken breast, cut in      strips<br />      1 cup cooked garbanzo beans<br />      1 cup cooked kidney beans<br />      1 1/2 cups pitted ripe olives<br />      2 avocados, sliced<br />      1 large red onion, thinly sliced<br />      1 cup feta or cream cheese, cut in cubes<br />      2 tomatoes, cut in wedges    </p>    <p>      Combine ingredients. Toss with Italian dressing. Serves      6-8.    </p>    <h3>      Barbecued Lima Beans    </h3>    <p>      Fresh or dried limas can be used to make this spicy      dish.<br />      2 1/2 cups cooked lima beans<br />      2 cups lima-bean cooking water<br />      1 small onion, chopped<br />      1 clove garlic, minced<br />      1 green pepper, chopped<br />      2 tablespoons margarine<br />      1 teaspoon horseradish<br />      1 teaspoon prepared mustard<br />      1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br />      1 tablespoon salt<br />      1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder 1 cup vinegar<br />      1 cup tomato sauce<br />      Bacon strips (optional)    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350°F. In a saucepan, brown onion,      garlic, and green pepper in margarine. Add bean liquid,      seasonings, and tomato sauce. Cook for 5 minutes or until      mixture begins to thicken. Alternate layers of beans and      sauce in a 2-quart casserole. Top with bacon strips (if      desired), and bake for 1 hour. Serves 4-6.    </p>
