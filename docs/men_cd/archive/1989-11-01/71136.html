            		 <p><strong>TO YOUR HEALTH</strong></p>         <p><strong><em>Americans have gotten the message but many      aren't taking proper care</em></strong></p>    <p><em>When it comes to the fitness of body, mind, or spirit,      the editors of</em> American Health <em>are there, staying      on top of the latest in medical research, separating fad      from fact, and helping you preserve and improve life's most      precious gift, your good health. Yet, despite a wealth of      information on living a healthier life, many Americans seem      to be missing the point.</em>    </p>         <h3>One Nation Under Fat</h3>    <p>"The United States has failed in fulfilling its fitness      goals and expectations," concludes Krys Spain, research and      program development specialist for the President's Council      on Physical Fitness and Sports, who has been monitoring the      nation's progress in meeting objectives set by health      experts in 1979. Two of these goals were to have 60% of      children aged 10 to 17 participating daily in school      physical education programs and 60% of adults participating      in regular vigorous physical activity.    </p><p>      Perhaps the most serious failure involves children. In 1984      the Department of Health and Human Services found that only      36% of children aged 10 to 17 had daily physical education      classes available to them-a marginal 3% increase over      1975 statistics. "One of the factors is money," Spain      comments. "When federal and state education budgets are      cut, the first thing to go is gym class." Only one      state-Illinois-requires daily physical      education classes for children.    </p>    <p>      As for adults, data from studies done between 1984 and 1987      indicate that only 8% of the total population participates      in regular vigorous physical exercise. That number doesn't      jibe with other studies that show well over half the      nation's population get some kind of regular exercise. Why      the discrepancy?    </p>    <p>      "A lot of the problem may be in definition," says Spain.      "What we define as regular vigorous activity-three      times a week for 20 minutes a session, at 60% of maximum      aerobic capacity-may be much more than what most      people think of as 'regular vigorous activity.' " They may      be playing softball, taking walks, or simply mowing the      lawn or climbing a few flights of stairs.    </p>    <p>      Spain also points out that most people who do exercise on a      regular basis are in the middle-income sector and are      well educated.    </p>    <p>      "We need to put more effort and more resources into      educating the public-through schools, churches, civic      groups, and other social organizations."    </p>    <h3>Row,Row,Row</h3>    <p>      Once you decide to become a vigorous exerciser, which      aerobic workout is best? According to a new study from Ohio      University in Athens, if the choice is between a rowing      machine or an exercise bike, you'll get the best      cardiovascular exercise on the rowing machine.    </p>    <p>      Fredrick C. Hagerman, director of the university's Work      Physiology Lab, and graduate student Sheila Marks studied      170 men and women aged 20 to 74 as they biked and rowed.      When they rowed, they not only burned more calories but      also used more large muscle groups. That means they      required more oxygen to fuel their workouts, so they      breathed more deeply, which in turn promoted better      cardiovascular fitness.    </p>    <h3>And Speaking of Biking</h3>    <p>      Harin Padma-Nathan, assistant professor of urology at the      USC School of Medicine, who specializes in sexual      disorders, finds many of his young male patients have      something in common: They ride a bike at least 100 miles a      week.    </p>    <p>      Biker's impotence is caused when the legs repeatedly thrust      down on the pedals, banging the groin on the seat and      damaging critical arteries and nerves. A hard, narrow seat,      long distances, a lean body, and an aggres sive riding      style can worsen damage.    </p>    <p>      The first warnings are numbness in the seat-of the-pants      area and difficulty in having an erection for a day or two.      Unfortunately, says Padma-Nathan, many riders react to the      sexual stress by biking more. To male bikers who want to      avoid trouble, he recommends that you first invest in a      padded bike seat. If you don't want a large seat, try a      U-shaped one. Second, rise off the seat occasionally,      especially when sprinting. Third, make sure your bike frame      fits you well. Position the seat so that you don't have to      shift your body on the downstroke. And, fourth, keep in      mind that damage may not be apparent for years. See your      doctor early if problems develop, since bike-related      impotence doesn't always reverse itself, and treatment may      not be available for advanced cases.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The AHA intends to place its chips on the      table.</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>Vitamin Vigor</h3>    <p>      If when you exercise you tire more easily than usual, you      could be deficient in vitamins B1, B 2, B6, and C. Why are      these vitamins so crucial to physical performance? They      help the body use fatty acids.    </p>    <p>      "A well-nourished person derives 60% of his energy from      fatty acids in foods, and 40% from glycogen, the stored      form of carbohydrates," says nutrition and sports-medicine      expert Erik Van der Beek. "If fatty acids can't be used,      the body has to draw on glycogen stores. This causes a more      rapid buildup of lactic acid and, in turn, fatigue."    </p>    <p>      These four vitamins must be replenished daily, he adds,      because they can't be stored. Van der Beek's advice: "If      you exercise and you're not sure your diet supplies the RDA      of these vitamins, or you feel more fatigued after exercise      than you used to, consider taking a multivitamin      supplement."    </p>    <h3>PMS and Caffeine</h3>    <p>      The causes of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are not      completely understood. But the caffeine in beverages such      as coffee and cola is one suspect, fingered several years      ago by a study at Oregon State University (OSU). Dr.      Annette MacKay Rossignol, chair of OSU's department of      public health, recently studied women who indulged in only      one type of caffeine drink-tea.    </p>    <p>      Of Rossignol's 188 tea-drinking subjects, 52% experienced      premenstrual symptoms, including anxiety, fatigue, and      tender breasts. She found that women who sipped four and a      half to eight cups a day suffered almost five times the PMS      symptoms of those who drank less.    </p>    <p>      Despite accumulating evidence, a cause-and-effect      relationship between caffeine and PMS has not been firmly      established. Factors such as a possible link between PMS      and the total amount of fluids consumed must be ruled out      first.    </p>    <p>      "There's more than one cause of PMS-many women with      severe symptoms may not even touch caffeine," says      Rossignol. "But since caffeine is not a nutrient, there's      no harm in eliminating it from your diet or cutting back      your intake."    </p>    <h3>The AHA Seal of Approval</h3>    <p>      "We'll soon launch the Consumer Health Information      Program-CHIP-which may change the way Americans      shop for food," says Myron L. Weisfeldt, director of      cardiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,      who has just begun a one-year term as president of the      American Heart Association (AHA).    </p>    <p>      "CHIP is exciting," he notes, "because consumers will be      able to walk into any store and quickly identify a product      that meets the AHA standards for dietary intake of      cholesterol, salt, and saturated fat. Such packaged and      processed foods will have an AHA seal signifying that they      are recommended as part of a heart-healthy diet.    </p>    <p>      "The American public has been begging for this. They're      bombarded with all kinds of information about dietary      guidelines, but complex labeling and misleading advertising      have made it difficult to figure out how a particular food      fits in. We hope CHIP will clear this up."    </p>    <p>      CHIP, however, has drawn fire from government food      regulators who suggest the AHA shouldn't be in the business      of rating foods, to which Weisfeldt replies: "We're      sensitive to the concerns of government but also to the      concerns of the public. And the public looks to the AHA to      take the lead in providing simple and accurate information      about which foods are better for their diet.    </p>    <p>      The AHA has a tradition of going after issues-as we      did with smoking and high blood pressure-and going      after them well. In the past, we've also been accused of      overstepping our bounds, and yet the credibility of the AHA      has improved. We think this will be the same with this      program. We have a large staff and are spending a good deal      of money to do this right."    </p>
