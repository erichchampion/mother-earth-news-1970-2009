                        <p>      <em>This hydroponic business is growing almost as fast as      its crops.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Pat Stone    </h5>        <p>      <em>The factory tour.</em> Come tour a remarkable      <em>plant</em> plant, where 18 workers produce 36,000 herbs      a week, then package, refrigerate, and deliver them to      grocery store chains over much of the East Coast.    </p>    <p>      <em>The herbs.</em> Each flavorful, six-inch plant reclines      in an attractive, hard-plastic case: a half ounce of basil,      mint, or other herb-roots intact.    </p>    <p>      Past, process, or product. Whichever you start with, your      setting will be New York's affluent Westchester County.      Here, 30 minutes from midtown Manhattan, lies a country      lane shaded by maples instead of high-rises. At its end is      Will O. Wood estates: a gorgeous mansion, woods, and lake,      and tucked around its side, our subject, Goodness Gardens.    </p>    <p>      <em>The past. 1981.</em> Twenty-year-old Brian Murphy is      landscaping part-time at Will O Wood and studying computers      in night school. Edward (Eddie) Rosenthal, estate owner and      financial investor, asks Murphy if he'd like to build and      run two hydroponic greenhouses for a research project.    </p>    <p>      Over three years, Brian learns (the hard way) greenhouse      construction and hydroponic crop management. The project      becomes a small business-the sale of tomatoes and      cucumbers. One day, college student Loretta Ciotoli pedals      by for a visit and, entranced, ends up taking a job.    </p>    <p>      From there, events accelerate. Hydroponic lettuce replaces      tomatoes and cucumbers. Ciotoli marries Murphy (her bridal      bouquet: two heads of hydroponic lettuce). Ciotoli-Murphy      tells Rosenthal that she can do a better job of selling      their produce than their current marketer. Eddie gives her      the chance, and she does: Sales shoot up. By 1986, 30,000      square feet of greenhouses yield $200,000 in sales. In      1987, it's 43,000 feet and $400,000.    </p>    <p>      But Loretta foresees trouble. "All of a sudden,      Weyerheuser, Campbell, everyone was getting into hydroponic      lettuce. The price was going to drop off. Brian and I were      sitting in our kitchen asking ourselves, 'What other green,      leafy items with quick turnover can we grow?' I looked up      at an old poster of culinary herbs we had on the wall and      said, 'Why not grow herbs?' " With a little help from Zita      Rosenthal (Eddie's wife), they did just that.    </p>    <p>      <em>The process: hydroponics.</em> Soil-less growing is      perhaps the quickest way to produce crops. Brian Murphy:      "Our crops mature 20 to 25% faster than those grown in      soil. Their roots get food immediately from the nutrient      solution. They stay small, so the plants put all their      energy into their tops. The crops are never under water      stress. And we can feed them exactly what they need to      grow. As a result, it takes us only four to six weeks to      raise an herb crop."    </p>    <p>      Hydroponics is also space and resource efficient. The      Murphys claim it would take 60 acres of outdoor growing      area (in chilly New York State) to produce the same annual      output their one acre of greenhouses does. They add that      they use only 500 gallons of water a day, while outdoor      crops can demand several thousand gallons.    </p>    <p>      The rub? Vigilance. Both Murphys work 80 hours a week.      Brian: "The crops have to be watched all the time. If a      pump shuts off on a summer day without our noticing it, we      could lose $20,000 worth of crops in an hour." He tests      everything by hand twice a day, refusing to go to a fully      automated system.    </p>    <p>      Each plant grows in a small foam cube that sits in a      U-shaped trough. (Brian designed these canals himself.      They're thin, so he can squeeze in more rows, and they have      wide overhanging lips to reduce evaporation.) One minute      out of every 10, a recycled nutrient solution is flushed      through the canals. (The roots absorb oxygen the other nine      minutes.) After two weeks, that batch of solution is      discarded, and for one day the crops are given plain water.      This cleansing "fast" helps prevent disease and encourages      the plants to concentrate essential oils.    </p>    <p>      Brian doesn't use any chemical pesticides and uses      botanical ones only as a last resort. Goodness Gardens'      crops thus fit current standards for "pesticide-free"      produce. However, since they're raised with chemical      fertilizers, they can not be certified as "organic. "      Murphy argues that his crops are just as wholesome and      nutritious. "Plants don't use organic matter; they use      inorganic nutrients. We just skip the breakdown process and      directly feed them the 16 nutrients they need. Look at it      this way: A lot of 'organic-diet' people take chemical      vitamins regularly. We're just popping daily vitamins to      our plants."    </p>        <p>      <em>The product: Timeless Thyme and friends.</em> Brian's      greenhouse systems are so efficient that it takes only two      employees to manage all 11 units. The real labor comes in      packaging: Fifteen workers man the assembly line. There,      each individual plant is cleaned, boxed, labeled (with such      names as Magical Marjoram, A Hint of Mint, and Oh-Oh!      Oregano!), and then refrigerated. The result?    </p>    <p>      Three thousand cases of Goodness Gardens herbs are shipped      each week. That's an amazing 36,000 half-ounce packages of      living herbs, each one retailing in grocery stores for      anywhere from 99 cents to $1.49.    </p>    <p>      Loretta's specialty is finding customers for those cases,      and she's done it by offering quality service. "We ship all      our herbs in our own refrigerated trucks, so we're sure      they're handled correctly. We use hard-plastic packs that      protect the plants and keep their roots intact, so they'll      stay fresh for two weeks instead of two days. And our      labels have recipes and serving suggestions to help people      understand how to use fresh herbs."    </p>    <p>      Consistency is another Goodness Gardens trademark. "We      guarantee A & P, Pathmark, Grand Union, Shop Rite, and      our other chains a year-round supply of the product      and-unique in the produce industry-a year-round      price. We don't sell basil for $4 in the summer and $20 in      the winter."    </p>    <p>      As a result, business is booming: Sales have almost doubled      every year since the switch to herbs. The Murphys now have      more than $1.5 million in annual sales ($350,000 profit)      and have become one of the largest hydroponic herb growers      in the country.    </p>    <p>      <em>The future: staying ahead.</em> Now they've reached      another turning point. Because of local zoning      restrictions, Goodness Gardens cannot expand any more at      its Westchester site. So the firm has started raising      additional crops outdoors in southern Florida.    </p>    <p>      Loretta's also looking further down the road. Basil (40% of      sales), mint (15% chives, oregano, and the other herbs are      all selling well now, and Ciotoli-Murphy has her eye on      several other East Coast cities she wants to move into.      Still, she sees the day when there'll be a glut of      hydroponic herbs on the market. Thus, she's once again      looking into other options (such as distributing other      growers' products) and crops (baby vegetables). The couple      also promotes the Wonder Grow garden, a 2' <em>X</em> 2'      homeowner's version of their hydroponic system ($229 from      Wonder Grow Corp., Journey's End Rd., Croton-on-Hudson, NY      10520).    </p>    <p>      Combine the Murphys' industriousness, growing skills,      aggressive marketing, and insistence on quality, and it      becomes clear that although this story could have three      beginnings, it will probably have only one ending.    </p>    <p>      Success.    </p>    <h3>      HOME-SCALE BUSINESS    </h3>        <p class="caption">      <em>On Florida's west coast Pete and Pat Barker manage an      eight-acre herb greenhouse in their own back yard- an      operation geared toward conserving labor and      resources.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>NOT EVERY HYDROPONIC HERB</strong>business is a big      one. In the Tampa, Florida, suburb of Brandon, Pat and Pete      Barker manage a prospering eighth-acre herb      greenhouse-right in their backyard.    </p>    <p>      The Barkers, like the Murphys, raised vegetables before      switching over to herbs, but their production and marketing      methods are on a much simpler, smaller scale. For instance,      Pete starts his basil by sprinkling the seed from a      saltshaker onto graveled rain-gutter beds. (Brian Murphy      uses a mechanical seeder to precisely implant his foam      cubes.) Instead of raising the crops in a completely      enclosed environment, the Barkers grow theirs under an      air-inflated plastic roof. During most of the warm Florida      year, the sidewalls are kept rolled up.    </p>    <p>      Rather than deliver carefully packaged five plants in      refrigerated trucks, Pat and Pete sbag cuttings (one basil      planting may thus produce for as long as a year) and      deliver them to wholesalers in a covered pickup. From      there, most of their produce goes to restaurants, including      many at Epcot Center, Disney World, and the Caribbean      islands.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the Barkers' income is more "home-scale" as      well. They gross $900 to $1,200 a week-instead of the      $29,000 (and growing) in sales the New York business      generates. But Pat and Pete aren't complaining. They're      working together at something they like and that helps      conserve resources. (Their operation uses less than 100      gallons of water a day-less than some families consume on      showers.) Indeed, since they keep coming up with ways to      make their jobs less labor-intensive, they've now reduced      their workweek to just 40 hours-between them!    </p>    <p>      - <em>Monica Brandies</em>    </p>
