            		        <p>      "To have beautiful and delicious greens early in the year,      when nothing else is available (except maybe wild      dandelions), try sowing spinach in the middle of autumn,"      writes Lance Mellon of Woodward, Pennsylvania. "The plants      will grow to medium size before winter sets in ... and      they'll burst forth in the early spring with loads of      greens, while your other?spring-planted-veggies are just      sprouting."<br />      <br />      Gary Coffey has a tip for those of you who are attempting      to plant (or transplant) evergreens and other shrubbery at      this often dry time of the year. The Mount Juliet,      Tennessee reader lines holes with potatoes before setting      the plants in place. He claims the spuds provide moisture      until the plant is adjusted and can better survive on its      own.<br />      <br />      Charlotte Pierce of Greensburg, Kentucky saves her child's      Halloween mask each fall and uses it in the following      spring's garden to scare away birds and other small      pests.<br />      <br />      A few squirts of light machine oil in your rabbits' ears      every two months or so will keep mites away, writes      bunny-raiser B. Alice Shipley of Jordan, Arkansas. (Alice      also advises against doing this during the coldest winter      months, because damp-eared rabbits are susceptible to      colds.)<br />      <br />      Barry Raygor, a serviceman in the U.S. Air Force who's      stationed in Britain, sent this tip from across the "big      pond". "Faded blue jeans are fashionable, but the denim      seems to wear out faster as its dye is lost. To prevent      this, soak your new dungarees in a tub of cold, clear      water. Then mix in one cup of ordinary table salt per pair      of jeans." Barry reports that this "recipe" has added years      to the look, and wear, of his blue jeans.<br />      <br />      Instead of sprinkling salt on your popcorn, try flavoring      the snack by melting salt-free butter and peanut butter      together, and pouring the mix over the popped kernels. Dave      and Julie Plourde of Rochelle, Illinois do, and find it      produces a good-tasting, healthful treat ... particularly      for folks who must restrict their salt intake (and we all      probably <em>should), or</em> those who need extra protein      in their diet.<br />      <br />      Paul Williams found himself stuck with a large doghouse      when his canine companion decided to move indoors. So the      Elsah, Illinois reader converted the vacant dog dwelling      into a woodbox, which could be placed just outside his back      door. He first loosened onehalf of the roof, hinged it at      the "peak", and added a hasp to the bottom of the same      side. Paul then nailed a piece of board over the doorway,      painted it, and used old rubber tubing as weatherstripping      to keep moisture out. The resulting woodbox is a handy      addition to Paul's back porch, and holds a goodly amount of      fuel.<br />      <br />      "One of the best indicators of an animal's general state of      health is the color of its gums," writes Barbara Burr of      Fruitland, Idaho. "Fit creatures will have gums that are a      bright, clear pink color, while pale pink generally      indicates anemia ... which is usually caused by worms. Gums      that are bluish in color suggest that the animal might have      circulatory problems, and gums with a yellow tint may      signal liver or kidney trouble."<br />      <br />      When Lisa Murray makes homemade lasagna, she doesn't bother      to precook the noodles. Instead, the Rembert, South      Carolina reader layers her dish with the raw pasta and      bakes as usual. When done, the noodles will be just as      tender as precooked pasta would be ... but they won't be      torn!<br />      <br />      Why buy high-priced herbal seasoning salts when you can      make them yourself? Sara McGinnis, of Anchorage, Alaska,      simply blends 5 tablespoons of salt with 2 teaspoons each      of the following ingredients: onion powder, garlic powder,      celery seed, and parsley flakes. She then adds 1 teaspoon      each of dried basil, marjoram, thyme, and oregano (she      first rubs the dried herbs through a screen) ... and then      mixes everything together before placing the seasoning in a      shaker bottle with large holes. Sara says the homemade      mixtures make great gifts for friends and family,      too.<br />      <br />      Lexington, Oklahoma reader Melvin Gates splits damaged or      abandoned hollow-core doors down the middle, lengthwise,      and then uses each half as a shelf for storage in his barn.      Mel says the recycled doors produce shelves that are at      least 15 inches wide and 6 feet long ... and cost far less      per shelf than would I X 12's purchased from the      lumberyard.<br />      <br />      Barbara Angersbach avoids the problem of bad-smelling      kitchen garbage by keeping an inch-deep layer of kitty      litter in the bottom of her trash can. The <em>North      Shore,</em> California resident says this is a particularly      effective measure for counteracting the odors of cigarette      butts and ashes.<br />      <br />      Homemade cupcakes take on an added delight when they're      baked in ice cream cones, according to Mary Siegert of      Tucson, Arizona. She stands the cones upright on an      ungreased cookie sheet, spacing them about two inches      apart. Mary then fills each mold half-full with cake      batter, and bakes them for 10 to 15 minutes (or until      they're done). Once the confections have cooled, she either      frosts the tops, <em>or</em> adds a scoop of ice cream to      each one! The clever lady says they're great hits at      children's parties, and that <em>mothers</em> like them,      too ... probably because the treats don't dirty any dishes      <em>or</em> leave paper wrappings to be cleaned up!    </p>        <p>      Al Smith offers this trick, which he <em>swears will</em>      improve portable AM radio reception in areas where stations      are hard to find. Al?who practices his technique in Rock      Springs, Wyoming runs an antenna lead and a ground lead      from the coaxial antenna cable of an abandoned car radio,      places the portable unit beside (or on top of) the car      radio, and then tunes <em>both</em> receivers to the same      channel. The car radio (which isn't turned on) becomes, Al      claims, sort of an external antenna for the portable.<br />      <br />      "If you've been unsuccessful in trapping mice, try using      cotton soaked in lard or bacon grease," writes Russell      Skinner of Central Point, Oregon. "Such bait will have a      double attraction for the rodents. They like lard as a      food, and will be tempted to use the cotton for their      nests. Furthermore, the soaked 'puffs' can be easily      fastened to the bait pan of the trap."<br />      <br />      Mrs. John Schwartz has a tip for MOTHER?readers who do      applique work, hemming, or other sewing chores: An ordinary      clear plastic bag can be used to bond two pieces of      material together! Mrs. Schwartz-who resides in Bigfork,      Montana-simply centers the plastic between the two pieces      to be joined, then places a brown paper sack over the top      and applies a hot iron. Any excess plastic will adhere to      the sack and come off. Appliques and hems will stay firmly      in place ... allowing you to easily overcast or blindstitch      them.<br />      <br />      <em>Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, downhome, timetested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday life.
