                    <p>      <em>A charming, old-time musical instrument returns to our      midst!</em>    </p>          <h5 id="byline">by Phillip Mason</h5>			<p>      Homemade music is alive and well. In fact, it's      experiencing a brisk revival ... and, as a result, some      wonderful musical instruments have been rescued from      obscurity. One of these is the hammered dulcimer: a      delightful "tune box" which was, until around the turn of      the century, very popular in our country. Fortunately, a      small enclave of devoted players stuck with this instrument      during its years of low popularity ... and now its      distinctive, happy voice is being heard again throughout      the land. Luthiers are turning out dulcimers in great      numbers, and many recordings are being made that feature      the instrument in a wide variety of musical settings.    </p>        <p>      Some of the hammered dulcimers built today are truly works      of art. Designed and constructed by fine crafts people,      they're made of top-quality--and often exotic-woods, and      many of them incorporate exquisite ornamentation to match      their beautiful sound. The cost of professionally built      dulcimers can range anywhere from several hundred to      several thousand dollars, depending on the instrument's      size and the degree of craftsmanship involved. With a      modicum of tools and experience, however, you can build a      hammered dulcimer that will have a lovely, clear, and      brilliant voice (dulcimer, after all, means "sweet song").      The necessary materials are readily available, and the      basic construction is little different from building a box.      Furthermore, the total cost of your homemade product should      run around $25!    </p>    <h3>      BASIC MATERIALS    </h3>    <p>      The pin blocks, frame, internal bridge braces, and the      bridges themselves will have to be made from fairly strong      hardwood ... such as white oak, maple, cherry, or walnut.      However, the most crucial wood is that used for the pin      blocks: It must be dense enough to grip the tuning pins      tightly, and strong enough to take the great stress imposed      by taut strings. Maple is the material most often used for      these components, but many good hardwoods will suffice. (In      fact, I've constructed some dulcimers using oak recycled      from wooden pallets.) Glancing at the list of materials      below, you'll notice that the pin blocks are made from 2 X      4 stock. If you have difficulty locating appropriate pieces      of this size, you can make your own by laminating several      thinner hardwood boards together. For example, by joining      three 3/4" X 31/2" planks, you can produce a block that's      2-1/4" thick. You'd then have to use 2-1/4"-wide pieces for      the frames and inside braces as well, but this wouldn't      interfere with the instrument's "voice" in any way.<br />      <br />      The dulcimer's top (soundboard) and bottom can be made from      plywood ... anything from A-C grade fir on up to the top      grades will do. For dulcimer construction, the beauty of      plywood lies in its enormous strength and dimensional      stability, which will add much to the structural integrity      and longevity of your instrument. The acoustical qualities      of plywood panels are especially well suited to the      dulcimer, producing a very desirable sound without too much      <em>sostenuto</em> (sustainment of tone).<br />      <br />      Keeping the above information in mind, you'll need to make      or procure the following:<br />      <br />      Materials:    </p>    <p>      3/4" X 15" X 31-1/2" bottom panel    </p>    <p>      (2) 1-3/4" X 3-3/4" X 15" pin blocks    </p>    <p>      (2) 3/4" X 1-3/4" X 24" frames (front and back)    </p>    <p>      (2) 3/4" X 1-3/4" X I I" side bridge braces    </p>    <p>      3/4" X 1-3/4" X 12" treble bridge brace    </p>    <p>      3/4" X 1-3/4" X 5" bass bridge brace    </p>    <p>      1/4" X 15" X 31-1/2" soundboard (top)    </p>    <p>      (2) 1/2" X 3/4" X 13-1/2" side bridges    </p>    <p>      (14) 1/2" X 3/4" X 1-1/8" bridges (10 treble and 4 bass)    </p>    <p>      (14) metal bridge caps (coat-hanger wire)    </p>    <p>      (2) side bridge caps (coat-hanger wire)    </p>    <p>      (14) No. 8 X I" roundhead screw hitch pins    </p>    <p>      (28) 0.198" diameter X 1-5/8" tuning pins (zither-type)    </p>    <p>      No. 6 (0.016" diameter) plain music wire    </p>    <p>      No.. 8 (0.020" diameter) plain music wire    </p>    <p>      No. 10 (0.024" diameter) plain music wire    </p>    <p>      some glue (Elmer's Carpenter's Glue or Franklin's Tite Bond      are good) various grades of sandpaper (from coarse to      superfine) some paint or varnish<br />      <br />      <strong>Tools:</strong> A hand-and coping saw, an      electric drill with 9/64" and 3/16" bits, bar and C-clamps,      an awl, and a sharp knife.<br />      <br />      <strong>Playing Accessories:</strong> A pair of hammers      (see Fig. 6), a tuning wrench, and a pitch pipe.    </p>        <p>      <strong>STEP-BY-STEP CONSTRUCTION</strong><br />      <br />      To begin, round off the top edges of the inside treble and      bass bridge braces to limit their contact with the      soundboard. Next , glue the pin blocks, outside frames, and      all four inside braces to the bottom panel (see Fig. 1).      During this step, it's best to leave the bottom piece      slightly oversized, and then trim it to fit after the      adhesive has dried. Be sure that all of the joints are      flush and square. Use clamps to hold the components in      place while the glue is setting, or assemble the parts with      screws to provide strong clamping action. When the interior      is complete, finish it with paint or varnish, except for      the top edges of the frames, braces, and pin blocks (to      which the soundboard will be glued).    </p>        <p>      With that done, cut out the soundholes and glue the      soundboard in place at all points, including the rounded      top surfaces of the treble and bass bridge braces (see Fig.      2). Next, after measuring and aligning them carefully, glue      the side pieces to the soundboard. Then, when the adhesive      has dried, go on to sandpaper and paint or varnish the      entire instrument.    </p>        <p>      At this point, you'll need to bring the tuning and      hitch-pin patterns (see Fig. 3) up to size, and transfer      them to each pin block area by simply piercing the dots      with an awl. You can then drill the tuning-pin holes with a      3/16" bit, and install the tuning pins by gently driving      (not screwing) them into their holes. Be sure to leave 1/4"      of space between the string hole in the pin and the      soundboard, to allow room for the winding of the strings      (see Fig. 4). Now, drill the 9/64" holes for the hitch      pins, and install those components at an outward angle of      about 30Â°.<br />      <br />      To string your dulcimer, you'll need No. 10 music wire for      the four bass courses, No. 8 for the lower five treble      courses, and No. 6 for the upper five (highest-pitched)      treble courses. (A course of strings is a group of two or      more tuned in unison.) When installing the wires, allow      enough slack to wind two or three full turns around each      tuning pin. The last turn should be fairly close to the      base of the pin. A method of installing one long string to      make up the required pair for each separate string course      is shown in Fig. 5.    </p>    <p>      Next, with a sharp knife or a nail, make a straight,      shallow groove in each bridge to hold the wire capping      material in place ... and clean any paint off the coat      hanger before cutting it to size and laying it in the      groove. Then install the treble and bass bridges under the      strings (the pressure of the tuned strings will hold them      in place).    </p>    <p>      To insure that the strings make solid contact with the side      bridges, you'll have to lower the height of three or four      treble bridges at the rear of the instrument. The bass      strings will not contact the right side bridge, and this is      normal. However, the proper contact of the rest of the      strings with their appropriate bridges is a most important      detail, so pay close attention to this factor.    </p>            <p>      The really critical measurements are those involved in the      placement of the treble bridges, which must divide the      strings crossing them into tones a fifth apart (a proper      fifth interval sounds like the "Twinkle, twinkle" of the      song "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"). The distance between      the left side bridge and the treble bridges must be      two-thirds of that between the right side bridge and the      treble bridges (see Fig. 2).<br />      <br />      Finally, when you've made a pair of hammers (see Fig. 6),      you'll be ready to tune and play your completed instrument.    </p>    <h3>      TUNING AND PLAYING    </h3>        <p>      Keeping the tuning chart provided in Fig. 7 in front of      you, begin adjusting your instrument's strings slowly and      carefully, using a chromatic pitch pipe (available at all      music stores) or a piano for reference. Start by tuning the      C# note on the right side of the first treble-course      bridge. When this pair of strings is correctly adjusted,      you'll have automatically tuned the strings on the left      side of the same bridge to G#. Continue up the right side      of the treble bridges until you've completed tuning the      high C at course number 8 (on the chart). Once that's      accomplished, you can adjust the remaining treble and bass      courses by setting their notes an octave above or below      notes you've already tuned up. For example, to tune the G      at the first bass course, compare it with the G you've      already tuned up at the right treble course number 5, and      simply set it an octave lower. (If tuning is difficult at      first, you might want to enlist the help of a musician      friend.)<br />      <br />      When the strings are in tune, assume a comfortable position      that allows free movement of hands, arms, and shoulders ...      and get ready to play! Tilting the dulcimer slightly toward      you will make it easier for you to reach to the rear string      courses. (Many people build themselves stands to hold the      instrument at an angle while they play in either a sitting      or a standing position.)<br />      <br />      It may seem as though the dulcimer is somewhat limited      because the player has only two hammers to strike notes      with. You'll find, however, that it takes some      concentration to keep from adding too <em>much</em>      complexity to your playing. Since a dulcimer's design      allows it to sustain sounds for quite some time, the      instrument gives the effect of sounding more notes than are      actually struck. The last few notes played mingle with the      new ones, and a great part of the hammered dulcimer's charm      lies in the fact that it provides its own background      harmony in this fashion.<br />      <br />      Begin by attempting familiar melodies in a simple manner,      dividing your playing equally between both hands by      alternating them as much as possible ... one note with one      hand, the next note with the other, and so on. This is      probably the single most important playing technique you      can develop, and it's worth learning <em>well. You</em> can      practice hand alternation and dexterity by playing scales      up and down, building your speed and smoothness as you go.      By referring to the string-course numbering system (see the      tuning chart), you can play the commonly used scales below      ... or, with a little retuning, develop others: In      addition, here re some of the many chord possibilities you      can use:    </p>    <h3>      A TUNE TO PLAY WITH    </h3>    <p>      Scales and chords are important, but most people are eager      to play a <em>tune</em> on their new instrument, so here's      a familiar one to get you started. The numbers over the      words indicate which strings to strike (check the tuning      chart again). Hit each string at a point fairly close to      the bridge (one or two inches away is about right).<br />      <br />      Once you've got the hang of it, you'll be playing tunes by      ear ... and wondering how on earth this wonderful      instrument ever left the limelight!    </p>    <h3>      RESOURCES    </h3>    <p>      There are some excellent mail-order sources for dulcimer      building supplies, books, records, and playing      instructional materials ... among them Andy's Front Hall,      Dept. TMEN, Drawer A, Voorheesville, New York 12186      (catalog free), and Jean's Dulcimer Shop, Dept. TMEN, P.O.      Box 8, Cosby, Tennessee 37722 (catalog $1.00, refundable).      A magazine dedicated to dulcimers is <em>The Dulcimer      Players News,</em> Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 2164, Winchester,      Virginia 22601. Finally, a good mail-order source of wood      is Craftsman Wood Service, Dept. TMEN, 1735 West Cortland      Court, Addison, Illinois 60101 (catalog $1.50).<br />      <br />      Tuning wrenches for dulcimer-sized pins (they're usually      called zither pins) can be found at most music stores: Ask      for an autoharp wrench (those instruments use identical      pins). The same music store, or your local piano tuner, may      also be a good source for tuning pins and music wire.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The author himself has instruction tapes      and books available for interested players.
