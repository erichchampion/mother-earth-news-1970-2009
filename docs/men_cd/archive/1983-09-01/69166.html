                        <h5 id="byline">by Randy Kidd</h5>     <p>      <strong>OK</strong> , fellow goat enthusiasts, here's the      <em>second</em> half of my discourse concerning some      reconsidered dos and don'ts of keeping caprine critters. As      those of you who read Part I will likely recall, I've      already discussed the number of does that (I think) make up      the perfect farmstead herd ... told you how to avoid the      pitfalls of "goatflation" . . . recommended qualities to      look for when buying a good milk animal ... and advised you      on where to keep your newly acquired charges once you get      them home. (If you <em>haven't looked</em> at the first      half of this feature, I suggest you pick up a copy of      MOTHER NO. 82 and turn to page 34.)</p>			    			<p>      And now that the preliminaries are out of the way, we can      get on to some of the <em>finer points</em> of goat      husbandry ... namely, breeding, milking, kid care, and home      veterinary treatment. But before we launch into those      subjects, let me reiterate something I said in Part 1: The      following hints (most of which I've learned the hard way!)      are meant only as suggestions-not as steadfast rules?to      help you discover the most efficient and simplest means of      rearing and handling <em>your own</em> milkers.    </p>          <h3>BRING ON THE KIDS</h3>    <p>      I used to tell folks to keep a buck around their homestead      for breeding purposes. Now, however-having long tried in      vain to deal with the cantankerous nature and malodrous      scent of the male goat?I have to re tract that bit of      poorly conceived advice, and offer in its place another,      much more sensible, plan!<br />      <br />      Why not get together with half a dozen or so other nanny      owners in your community, and pool all of your resources to      buy <em>one</em> exemplary buck that can serve all of your      does. Then-and this is the tricky part!?see if you can't      talk one of those other goat lovers into boarding (with the      expenses shared by everyone, of course) "old whisker face"      on his or her farm. Naturally, you'll have to go to the      trouble of hauling your does over to this benevolent      neighbor's barn at breeding time ... but-take my word for      it that's a very small price to pay for keeping      <em>your</em> backyard clean-smelling!<br />      <br />      If you can't find someone magnanimous enough to care for a      "collective" buck, I'd suggest you utilize artificial      insemination (Al). This method is well suited to goat      raising and is the very best-and least expensive -way to      <em>upgrade</em> your herd. (Semen from some of the top      breeders in the country is available for as little as $5 to      $25 a unit.) Unfortunately, Al requires that you      artificially inseminate your does, and it's sometimes hard      to catch the females in heat ... but you'll have to in      order to <em>do</em> this. In fact, some gals won't come      into season unless there's a male goat on the premises.      However, you <em>can</em> fool them. Just take an old rag      and-during the fall breeding period?wipe it on a buck's      head, where the horns should be, and along its hocks. Then      hang the dripping-wit h? maleness cloth where the does can      smell it. Within 48 to 72 hours, your ladies should be in      heat.<br />      <br />      Incidentally, while we're on the subject of breeding, there      are two often- recommended, tricks" that I would not      advise. First of all, don't try (by artificially creating a      facsimile of the declining daylight hours typical of "heat"      season) to bring your does into heat during their      off-breeding period in the spring. I don't feel that the      results warrant all the extra time and effort that are      involved in this particular technique. You see, the      percentage of does that settle (get pregnant) when bred      under such conditions is usually small, and oftentimes the      buck just isn't interested in mating during the spring.    </p>    <p>      Second, I don't recommend the use of hormones to      synchronize heat cycles ... to promote superovulation (an      increase in the number of ova released) ... or to induce      labor. Although such substances have been used successfully      with cattle, they've been tested here at the Kansas State      University College of Veterinary Medicine ... and early      results indicate that they're ineffective, and even      harmful, when given to goats. (In fact, some does have      developed cystic ovaries as a result of hormones.) So when      breeding your caprine gals, stick as close as you can to      the procedures nature intended.    </p>    <h3>      ON TO THE MILK FACTORY    </h3>    <p>      Heretofore, in my reports in the pages of THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS$, I haven't really paid a whole lot of attention to      the all-important subject of milking. But now I'd like to      take the time to offer a few pointers on this topic!<br />      <br />      First of all, to avoid the risk of having unwanted barnyard      "fumes" taint your fresh milk (and also to allow yourself      more comfort), you might want to milk your does in an area      that's <em>separate from</em> their pens. And, having      sampled the "joys" of scrunching into a shed and kneeling      on the hard ground to get at my goats' udders, I can tell      you that I'm now a real <em>milking-stand enthusiast!</em>      These easy-to-construct (see No. 61, page 176) goat      restrainers can be placed almost anywhere, and they can      turn a potentially back-straining job into an easy      sit-on-a-stool task ... since milking time rolls around      <em>twice</em> a day, that's quite a plus!<br />      <br />      And don't worry about how your animals might take to using      one of these stands, either. If you make sure there's      always plenty of food in the bin for them to munch on, the      does will just hop right up and peacefully eat away while      you do the milking. As an added bonus, such a structure can      serve the dual purpose of holding your critters when you      need to trim their hooves ... or vaccinate them ... or      perform any <em>other</em> unpleasant chore that they might      not otherwise be willing to stand still for.<br />      <br />      Aside from using a milking stand (a tool that a lot of      goatkeepers <em>don't</em> take advantage of), most of my      milking techniques are pretty standard. Be sure to clean      each doe's udder with a <em>fresh</em> paper towel      saturated in disinfectant, before you begin. Then strip off      the first few streams of milk into a black strip cup to      check for the cheese-like chunks or stringy material that      are signs of mastitis (an inflammation of the mammary      glands). If the milk is OK, continue to work ... straining      the liquid through a clean (which means that you have to      <em>thoroughly</em> wash it after <em>each</em> milking!)      cheesecloth into a sanitized metal container. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE. Some sources advise that you use tin or stainless      steel strainers that are specifically made for your pail-or      even disposable strainers?rather than cheesecloth.]</em>      When you're finished milking-and before you send that      little mama back to her pen-dip each of her teats in a      specially prepared solution (ask your vet for a      recommendation) to help protect her against mastitis.    </p>    <p>      That done, pour the milk into sterilized glass containers      (with lids), and place the covered jars in a refrigerator.      To insure that the milk stays fresh as long as possible,      some folks place the containers in an ice bath before      refrigerating them ... but this process has always seemed      like a lot of trouble to me. After all, unpasteurized      milk?if put directly into the icebox-will remain      fresh-tasting for at least three days. So I simply date      each jar, and-when day number three rolls around-I give the      old milk to the pigs!    </p>    <p>      (Note: Are you wondering what you'll do with your      regular-and sizable-supply of nice, fresh goat's milk      before day number three? Well, around our house we use it      to produce delicious yogurts, custards, and ricotta cheese.      Goat's milk also adds a delicate sweetness to almost any      bakery or candy recipe. What's more, I'd be hardpressed to      think of any better treat than a dish of homemade goat's      milk ice cream!)    </p>    <h3>      KID CARE    </h3>    <p>      Of course, the production of milk is triggered by pregnancy      ... which means that?come spring-you'll probably have some      youngsters to care for. However, that extra work can be      quite worthwhile, because if the mamas give birth to a good      "crop" of quality kids, you could-by selling them?make      enough money to feed your milkers <em>(and</em> keep your      family supplied with <em>free</em> dairy products) for a      year! With this in mind, then, you'll want to do everything      possible to make sure that your valuable goatlings remain      robust and healthy.<br />      <br />      Start your kid-care program by seeing to it that each      young'un gets a healthy dose of colostrum (its mother's      first nutrient-rich and anti-body-laden milk) within the      first 12 hours after birth. From then on, the little guys      and gals will need to have their mom's milk fed to them      <em>three</em> times a day, from a soda bottle (or similar      container) fitted with a special lamb's nipple. Of course,      you could let them nurse from the doe herself, but-if you      do-you'll likely find that they're much harder to wean when      necessary. Besides, almost any kid will take to a bottle      with no problem, as long as its mother is nearby to provide      company and reassurance.<br />      <br />      During the first week, feed your young animals 6 to 8      ounces of milk, three times a day, and then increase the      dosage to 10 to 12 ounces. (Be careful not to overfeed,      though, as that could result in a case of "the runs"!) Once      the kids are about two weeks old-and <em>while</em> they're      still nursing?you can help them start to develop their      <em>rumens,</em> that is, their adult stomachs, by      providing them with access to tasty grains (mine like      cracked corn and rolled oats) and fresh, leafy hay. Be      sure, also, to put a new section of hay in their midst      daily, and to change the grain regularly, to accommodate      any particularly <em>fastidious</em> eaters.<br />      <br />      In addition to maintaining an appropriate feeding schedule      for your doelings, you'll need to see to it that the      youngsters have ample pen space <em>and</em> adequate      shelter. I feel that stock panels, though they are costly,      are <em>effective</em> enough to be considered practical      goat fencing. However, during your kids' first month, you      <em>can</em> make do by simply putting up a 32-inch hog      stock-panel fence (which you can easily step over). Also,      you can save yourself a little more money if, instead of      building sheds for the kids, you house them in old 4' X 8'      wooden packing crates (equipped with lots of regularly      changed straw bedding).<br />      <br />      I make a practice of penning all my young goats together,      on one lot, until they're ready to be weaned at three to      four months. Then I move them onto another section of      ground (remember, stock panels are easy to relocate).      However, I suggest that you not put your juveniles in with      the adults until the youngsters reach breeding age (when      they're six to eight months old). Also keep in mind that      <em>next year's</em> kids shouldn't be kept on the same      terrain as were this season's. In fact, you should wait at      least <em>three years</em> before using the same ground for      goat turf again. By rotating the kid lots in this manner      and keeping the offspring away from the grown-ups, you can      all but eliminate the goat-killing disease coccidiosis.      (Note: As a further precaution against this problem, burn      the packing crate sheds as soon as the kids have outgrown      them.)<br />      <br />      Since, in issue 65, I've already explained the techniques      for disbudding and castrating kids <em>(and</em> since I'm      still satisfied with that information), I won't take up      space to discuss them again. I will add, though, that      <em>now</em> (having decided <em>not</em> to board a buck)      I usually slaughter all my male kids either immediately      after birth or within six months (to give them a chance to      fatten up). Perhaps this sounds harsh, but adding      <em>chevon</em> to the freezer is one good way to fight the      rising tide of "goatflation" (see Part I for <em>other</em>      ways to beat this checking-account drainer).</p>      <h3>THE THREE PRIME FEEDING PERIODS</h3>      <p>      There are three nutritionally critical periods in a goat's      life: [1] a kid's first few months ... [2] Mama's first two      months of lactation ... and [3] a doe's dry months. If you      maintain adequate records (so you'll be prepared for such      periods before they come around) and feed your animals      according to their needs during each of these times, you      should be able to keep your critters in pretty good      fiddle.<br />      <br />      We've already discussed a <em>newborn's</em> dietary      requirements, so I'll move on to the second crucial feeding      period: the initial months of lactation. During this time,      a doe will produce the maximum amount of milk that she's      capable of. Therefore, in order to fuel her "internal      factory" sufficiently, she has to eat <em>top-quality</em>      grain and hay. Normally, you can figure that a lactating      female should get about one-third to one-half pound of      grain for each pound of milk she yields in a day. However,      when she's at her milk-making peak, it can be nigh onto      impossible to satisfy all her energy requirements. If that      seems to be the case, just be sure that during this time      you give her the best grain and hay (preferably alfalfa)      you can afford, and that you allow her plenty of time to be      able to eat as much of her food as she can pack in!    </p>    <p>      Hint: The grain mix should be from 16% to 18% protein if      it's fed with a low-protein hay (such as timothy or prairie      hay). But should you be feeding a high-energy hay (like      alfalfa), you'll be able to get by with a grain that's only      12% to 15% protein. Using a bit of "guest imation", then,      you can probably figure that an average milker will need      about 1,000 pounds of hay a year (that's around 3 pounds a      day) and roughly 1,000 pounds of grain ... which should      work out to be approximately 1/2 pound of grain for each of      the 2,000 pounds of milk she gives! Better producers will,      naturally, need additional feed.    </p>    <p>      The third dietary prime time in a goat's life occurs during      the two months prior to kidding. You can do a lot to insure      that your doe has an easy delivery, healthy babies, and a      problemf-ree lactation ... just by keeping her in good      flesh (without letting her get downright fat) and by making      sure her calcium intake is low during this period.      Naturally, a pregnant doe will put on "kid pounds" . . .      but watch her ribs right behind her shoulders, because she      shouldn't put on so much fat that they "disappear". (In      general, if you feed a doe a couple of pounds of grain each      day and all the hay she wants, her developing babies will      stay healthy and her figure will remain fit and trim.)    </p>    <p>      Then, in order to keep your mother-to-be's calcium intake      in line, simply feed her a mineral mix that doesn't contain      that substance! Also, feed her only a low-calcium,      nonleguminous hay, such as timothy or prairie hay. After      the kids arrive, switch Mama to a mix that does have      calcium in it (with a calcium: phosphorus ratio of 1:1 to      2: 1) and put her on a better-quality hay.    </p>    <p>      And always keep in mind that goats need lots of water and      exercise! One doe can drink as much as two to five gallons      of liquid on a cool day ... so make sure there's plenty of      fresh water available to your herd at all times. You might      also want to take your does for an out-of-pen stroll      (preferably every day). However, even the trek from the      yard to the milking area is better than no exercise at all.    </p>    <h3>      MEDICAL ASPECTS    </h3>    <p>      Now that your goats are eating well and are getting a lot      <em>of</em> exercise, it's time to attend to their medical      needs. To begin with -as you probably already know-every      goatherd should be able to trim feet, vaccinate, worm,      disbud, and castrate (see MOTHER NO. 65, page 74, for      further information). And although there isn't enough room      left to go into a step-by-step description <em>of</em> each      <em>of</em> these procedures, there is just the right      amount <em>of</em> space left for me to list what I think      are the four main points <em>of</em> a good at-home      goat-care program.<br />      <br />      Vaccinations. Kids need <em>Clostridium perfringens C</em>      and D plus a tetanus toxoid when they reach six to eight      weeks <em>of</em> age (with a repeat dose <em>of each</em>      a month later).<br />      <br />      Furthermore, adult animals have to have an annual booster      for both <em>of</em> these vaccinations 30 days prior to      kidding.<br />      <br />      Wormers. Goats must be wormed in the spring <em>and</em>      fall (or more often, <em>if</em> the herd is confined to a      small area). If you use a variety <em>of</em> anthelmintics      (worm medicines), the parasites will be less likely to      develop a resistance to any one substance. The easiest      wormers to administer are those that are available in paste      form (boluses are nearly impossible to get down a goat's      gullet, and wormers that are added to the feed are often      ignored).<br />      <br />      Vitamin E/selenium. A vitamin E/ selenium injection should      be given to a doe 30 days before she's due to kid      <em>if</em> you live in a region typified by a selenium      deficiency ... and the youngsters should receive a shot      when they're three weeks old.<br />      <br />      An annual visit from your favorite vet. No matter how      proficient a backyard doctor you are, you (and your goats!)      should still take advantage <em>of</em> the knowledge and      experience <em>of</em> a certified vet once a year. He or      she can help you pinpoint existing or potential problems,      and can assist you in setting up a good healthcare program      for your animals.</p>      <h3>THE LAST WORD?</h3>      <p>      All right, I've had my <em>second</em> chance to update my      earlier advice on goatkeeping. And I hope that my hints      (all <em>of</em> which are the result of long experience)      have been helpful to you ... because now it's <em>your</em>      turn! Get out there in the goat pen and start developing      your own individual techniques for tending to that herd of      capricious (and lovable) caprine critters!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Revisions notwithstanding, Randy Kidd's      original article in MOTHER NO. 65, "How to Raise Healthy      Goats", presents a thorough discussion of getting started      with dairy goats.

This paperback, which was written by the      editor and publisher of Countryside magazine, covers the      basics, discusses different breeds, and then dots the i's      on various aspects of successful goatkeeping. It should be      useful to beginner and old-timer alike.    </p>    <p>      Another helpful book-which, like Belanger's, takes the      approach that goats are ideal for home food production-is      Raising Goats: The Backyard Dairy Alternative by David B.
