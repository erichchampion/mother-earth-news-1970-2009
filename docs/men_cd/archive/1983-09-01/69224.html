                <p>      With autumn coming on fast, there's still time to treat      yourself, or the outdoorsman or -woman in your life, by      sewing...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Charlotte Heron    </h5>        <hr />        <p>      If you (or someone you know) have fruitlessly searched the      racks of your local sporting goods stores (and the pages of      catalogs!) for a hunting vest that's designed to carry all      of the items an outdoorsperson <em>needs,</em> don't      despair! My husband had the same problem, and the      custom-tailored , double-fronted garment I designed for him      may be just what <em>you've</em> been looking for, too.      What's more, it will likely cost less than would a      (probably unsatisfactory) storebought version.<br />      <br />      When my man took up duck hunting in earnest, he began to      realize the need for a vest that would afford a place for      everything and would <em>keep</em> everything in its place.      His dream garment-he told me-would have not only the      standard large game pouch in back, but would also feature      individual pockets to hold nearly two boxes of shotgun      shells for easy and quick reloading, similar pouches for      his duck and goose calls, and several other pockets for      miscellaneous hunting paraphernalia. And after vainly      trying to scout up a commercial vest that could meet his      requirements, my mate asked me to <em>make</em> him      one.<br />      <br />      So, keeping that dream vest in mind, I created a garment      with two layers in front ... each with multiple pockets,      some specialized and some general-purpose. Easy access to      all of these was provided for by cutting the outer layer in      such a way as to leave a wider opening in the center than      the <em>inner</em> vest has, and by attaching a zipper only      to the bottom 9 inches of the outer layer.<br />      <br />      Furthermore, you don't need to be an expert seamstress or      tailor to put together a more-thanserviceable hunting vest      following my method! The cost of materials should be in the      neighborhood of $25 (mine cost a total of $19.88, but I      already had a pattern and a few of the other necessary      items on hand).    </p>        <p>      <strong>GATHER THE MATERIALS</strong><br />      <br />      You'll need the following equipment to make the vest:<br />      <br />      [1] About 3-1/3 yards (you may have to buy 3-1/2 yards, as      many stores don't like cutting cloth in thirds) of sturdy,      45-inch-wide fabric, such as duck, twill, denim, or canvas      . . . you might have to go to a specialty store for the      last item. (I used heavy twill at $4.99 per yard, which      came to $16.60. The other fabrics should be approximately      the same price.) You may require more or less fabric,      depending on the size pattern you use.<br />      <br />      [2] One man's vest pattern, such as the Simplicity "Set of      Vests" (No. 9793) at $3.50, or the Butterick "Men's Lined      Vest" (No. 4005) at $2.50. 1 happened to have a pattern for      a size 44 man's suit, which <em>included</em> a vest, and      used that ... though it did require some modification. Keep      in mind, when choosing your pattern, that a hunting vest      should fit <em>over</em> other outerwear and will therefore      be <em>larger</em> than the wearer's normal vest      size.<br />      <br />      [3] One 22-inch, heavyweight jacket zipper. (The model by J      & P Coats is marketed for $1.75.)<br />      <br />      [4] Four heavy-duty 1/2-inch snaps (or your own favorite      pocket fastener-such as the self-adhering kind-that will      allow for easy, one-handed opening). An appropriate      snap-fastener set, with an attaching tool and a hole      puncher, sells for $3.00 to $3.50, but I'd suggest that you      try to borrow these first if you don't have them.<br />      <br />      [5] One package of regular or wide bias tape (approximately      954).<br />      <br />      (6] One spool of cotton-covered polyester thread (around $      1.09).<br />      <br />      [7] One 1/2-inch or larger metal ring (approximately      10c).<br />      <br />      [8] Several feet of cord ... the amount needed will depend      upon the number of game calls the wearer is likely to carry      (about 20c/foot).<br />      <br />      [9] Five feet of 3-inch-wide heavy elastic, if you choose      this option when making the shotgun-shell holders (see      below), at roughly $2.25/yard.<br />      <br />      You'll also need a pair of sharp scissors, a piece of      fabric marking chalk, a number of straight pins, some brown      paper (or paper begs), and access to a sewing machine (or      to a friend who sews!).    </p>        <p>      <strong>MODIFYING THE PATTERN</strong><br />      <br />      Since I used a man's dress-vest pattern as the basis for my      project, I had to add length to the components before      thinking about how to handle the special "hunter's"      modifications. If you use a pattern for a hip-length vest      (such as those listed above), this step shouldn't be      necessary. Whichever you use, however, it's a good idea to      make some trial fittings--using the basic pattern--before      you go on. I pinned mine together at the shoulders and      sides and hid my husband try the paper vest on, which he      found a bit snug (since the original garment was meant to      go <em>under</em> a suit jacket): After I added an      inch-wide strip of paper to each side scam, it fit      perfectly. (Pattern paper is flimsy and tears easily, so      it's best to lay your pieces out on a sheet of brown      paper-disassembled supermarket bags work fine!and cut      around them. The heavier paper pattern will stand up to      repeated fittings, if necessary.)<br />      <br />      Remember that you'll have to prepare patterns for      <em>two</em> sets of vest fronts, since the vest is to be      double-layered (Fig. 1). Mark the inner set "Front A" and      the outer set "Front B". (Front A should be cut wider, from      the neck opening to the chest, than Front B, as shown in      Figs. I and 2). Now, draw all of your pockets onto the      patterns, making sure that they are <em>exactly</em> the      right size and shape. The Front A pieces of my vest      incorporate the duck- and goose-call pockets and the      shotgun-shell holders (Fig. 3). The Front B pieces      accommodate two large outside pockets with flaps ... the      (optional) small pocket on the <em>right</em> side (Fig. 2)      ... and two inside pockets (Fig. 4), which are attached to      the <em>wrong</em> side. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: For you      hunters unfamiliar with sewing jargon</em> right      <em>and</em> wrong <em>refer to the front and back sides of      a piece of fabric, respectively, and have nothing to do      with morality.]</em> The back of the vest supports the      single large game pouch (Fig. 5). On my vest, the back      pocket was cut to 14" X 40" to allow for pleats and      expandability.<br />      <br />      Once you've settled on the sizes, shapes, and locations of      all of your pockets, make a separate paper pattern for each      so that later you can lay them out on the fabric to cut the      pieces you'll need. (Don't forget the pocket flaps!)    </p>        <p>      <strong>CUTTING THE FABRIC</strong><br />      <br />      Preshrink and press the fabric, if necessary ... then place      all of your pattern pieces on the cloth, arranging them so      as to waste as little material as possible (there's always      another project down the road!). <em>Be sure to leave space      for a one-inch seam allowance around all sides of each      piece!</em> Attach the patterns to the cloth with straight      pins, draw the seam allowances around them with marking      chalk, and then cut out all of the pieces.<br />      <br />      <strong>ASSEMBLING AND</strong> <strong>ATTACHING THE      POCKETS</strong><br />      <br />      Begin sewing the vest by assembling and attaching the      pockets in the following manner:<br />      <br />      [1] Sew the oversized pleats into the back pocket.<br />      <br />      [2] Hem all of the pocket pieces, flaps, and shell- and      call-holder strips, using a rolled hem so that no raw edges      show. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: To you experts, a "rolled hem"      may suggest the kind of very fine, narrow hem found on      handkerchiefs or lingerie. Here, the author simply means      that the material is folded double, as shown in Fig.      6.]</em><br />      <br />      [3] Check the finished pockets against the drawings on the      pattern to make sure they're all of the correct size.<br />      <br />      [4] Attach the Front B inside pockets to the wrong side of      the Front B pieces (Fig. 4).<br />      <br />      [5] Sew the Front B outside pockets and pocket flaps to the      right sides of that component and attach the fasteners to      the pockets (Fig. 1).<br />      <br />      [6] Sew the back pocket and back pocket flap to the right      side of the vest back and attach the fasteners (Fig. 5).    </p>        <p>      <strong>SEWING SHELL</strong> <strong>AND CALL      HOLDERS</strong><br />      <br />      The trickiest task involved in making this vest for me, at      least-was sewing the shell holders. However, after some      trial-and-error practice using scrap fabric, I came up with      the following method:<br />      <br />      [1] Lay two of the 3" X 12" shell-holder strips, one on top      of the other, in position on the right side of the Front A      panel. Then sew them together and to Front A along one      3-inch end (Fig. 3).<br />      <br />      [2] Slip a shell of the correct size for the wearer's gun      (or, if he or she has more than one firearm, the      largest-sized shell used) against the end seam and between      the two shell-holder pieces, and sew the parts together to      form a tube for the shell. Next, place another shell      between the vest fabric and the bottom shell-holder piece.      Sew that bottom piece to the vest, forming a second tube.      Then insert a third shell between the two shell-holder      sections (as you did with the first shell) to make a third      tube. Continue until all of the tubes are formed in a      honeycomb-like pattern.<br />      <br />      [3] Stitch across the bottom of the holder, so that the      shells won't fall out and the holder is securely fastened      to Front A.<br />      <br />      The call holders are formed in much the same manner, by      laying the calls onto Front A and placing the 3 " X 13 "      call-holder strip over them. Just pin the material to the      vest between calls, remove the calls, and stitch the holder      to the vest along the pinned lines and at its bottom      edge.<br />      <br />      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> A simpler, though perhaps less      aesthetic, method <em>of</em> making the shell holders      (it's often used in commercial vests) requires that you use      a wide strip of heavy elastic-the kind used in      girdles--instead <em>of</em> cloth. Hem the ends and sew      the elastic strip ends and bottom to a backing      strip-or directly onto Front A-then stitch it down      vertically, at about one-inch intervals, to form tubes. If      the wide elastic isn't available in your area, multiple      strips <em>of</em> narrower material could be used, or a      single strip could be attached to form loops rather than      pockets. Elastic has the advantage <em>of</em> being able      to hold a variety of shell sizes firmly.]<br />      <br />      The last step before assembling the vest is to sew the      metal ring and its tab onto Front A at a point above the      call pockets. Cords tied to each call are then fastened to      the ring, and should be long enough to permit the calls to      be used while still attached.<br />      <br />      <strong>ASSEMBLING THE VEST</strong><br />      <br />      [1] Roll-hem the sides and centers of Front A and Front B      ... leaving the shoulders, the armholes, and the bottom      unhemmed. Then roll-hem the back vest neck (or use bias      tape, for a smoother finish).<br />      <br />      [2] Lay the left and right Front A pieces on a flat surface      with their shell holders up. Place the left and right Front      B pieces on top of the Front A sections with their flapped      pockets up. Sew the Front B and Front A pieces together,      starting at a point along the center front of the pieces,      10 inches up from the bottom, and proceeding down to the      bottom, along it, up the side, around the armhole, and      across the shoulder (Fig. 1).<br />      <br />      [3] Now, attach the double-layered fronts to the back piece      at the shoulders with a flat-fell seam (Fig. 7). To do so,      stitch the seam with the right side of the fabric out,      using the full seam allowance. Then press the seam      allowance to one side, keeping the stitching line on top.      Next, trim the underside of the allowance to one-half its      width. Finally, turn the upper seam allowance evenly over      the trimmed edge, and topstitch. Use the same type of seam      to sew the sides together. Remember that the front is      double-layered, so there'll be three layers of material in      the seam, not just two.<br />      <br />      [4] Hem the bottom.<br />      <br />      [5] Finish the armholes with bias tape.<br />      <br />      [6] Stitch the zipper in place, sewing it from the bottom      to the neck of Front A but only to the lower 9 inches of      Front B. This will provide easy access to the shell holders      and inside pockets when the vest is zipped (see the      photo).<br />      <br />      <strong>FINISHED PRODUCT</strong><br />      <br />      It took me the better part of a weekend to design and sew      this vest, using a modified commercial pattern. You could      alter a pattern of your choice to suit my method, or work      from the drawings I've provided. (Keep in mind that the      pattern I used was a size 44 garment, thus you'd have to      make size adjustments as necessary.) The total cost of the      materials for my husband's vest was less than $20, though I      did already have a pattern, metal ring, and cord ... and      found other items on sale. Your expenses will vary      according to what you have on hand or can scrounge or pick      up at a discount, but it shouldn't come to much more than      $25. And for that cost, you'll end up with a dandy      custom-tailored hunting vest .. . . and, quite likely, a      very happy hunter!    </p>
