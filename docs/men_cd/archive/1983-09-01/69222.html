                <p>      As the use of toxic chemicals, synthetic hormones, and such      increases, so does evidence that our polluted environment      i's damaging the ability of humans to reproduce.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Michael Castleman    </h5>        <hr />    <p>      The effect seems clear: The average sperm count of American      males is dropping. Studies have indicated that the      proportion of men who have 100 million sperm per milliliter      (ml) of semen has dropped from 80% in 1929 ... to 44% in      1950 ... all the way down to 22% in 1977! But what is the      cause of this problem? Well, for a while, much of the      popular news media offered lighthearted speculation that      the lowered sperm counts might be related to a society-wide      increase in sexual activity (which supposedly left males      with depleted reserves) or to widespread use of      tight-fitting underwear (which may, indeed, subject      heat-sensitive sperm to injurious temperatures by holding      them unnaturally close to the body).<br />      <br />      In September o 1979, though , the topic suddenly became      less than funny when Robert C. Dougherty suggested-in      <em>Chemical and Engineering News</em> that toxic      chemicals, <em>not</em> sex or underwear, were the main      causes of the decrease in men's sperm counts. The Florida      State University professor found high levels of four toxins      in semen samples taken from 132 student volunteers. Three      of the seminal pollutants-polychlorinated biphenyls      (PCBs), DDT, and hexachlorobenzene-are widely      recognized as carcinogens <em>and</em> teratogen's (sub      stances that cause birth defects by mutating DNA in      reproductive cells) ... while the last, the wood      preservative pentachlorophenol, is quite possibly      carcinogenic as well. The students' most frequent sperm      count was 20 million per milliliter of semen. This is an      ominously low figure. (Compare it to the 60 million/ml      sperm count most prevalent in a 1974 study and 100      million/ml found in 1929!) In fact, a sperm count below 20      million/ml generally indicates a man with a fertility      problem. The FSU chemist even said that 23% of the young      adults he examined had counts so low that he considered      them almost certainly sterile.<br />      <br />      <strong>VERY VULNERABLE</strong><br />      <br />      Dougherty noted that his findings were suggestive, not      definitive. However, since 1775, when Percival Pott      reported unexpectedly high rates of scrotal cancer in      British chimney sweeps, and soot became the first      identified environmental carcinogen, it's been recognized      that the testicles are particularly sensitive to toxic      substances. And small wonder: Those reproductive organs      contain the body's highest concentration of genetic      material, and this DNA-housed in cells so fragile that      millions of them are needed to provide a reasonable chance      that <em>one will</em> fertilize an egg-is poorly protected      from chemical attack. In addition, carcinogens tend to      cause tumors most quickly in tissues composed of rapidly      dividing cells ... and the cells that cleave the most in      adult men <em>are</em> those involved in spermatogenesis.      Indeed, the testicles are so sensitive to toxins that Dr.      Charming Meyer, chief of the Hazards Branch of the National      Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, has suggested      that regular employee sperm counts be used to test the      safety of industrial chemicals!<br />      <br />      <strong>CULPRITS</strong><br />      <br />      In two regrettable extreme instances, Dr. Meyer's      suggestion has, in effect, been followed. The instances      occurred when a pair of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides      were involved in infertility scandals. Kepone, the first,      apparently caused worker sterility at its production      plant-Life Sciences Products Company-in Hopewell, Virginia.      It was also discharged into the Chesapeake Bay, where it      turned up in commercial fish in concentrations high enough      to, according to the <em>American Journal of      Epidemiology,</em> "seriously jeopardize" the local fishing      industry. Likewise, workers in Occidental Petroleum's      Lathorp, California plant noticed that men who worked with      the pesticide dibromochloropropane (DBCP) became ill and      seemed unable to father children. After tests showed that      the workers were sterile, California banned DBCP in 1977,      yet the pesticide continued to be used extensively in other      states ... leaving detectable residues on a variety of      fruit crops. In 1979 the Environmental Protection Agency      banned its use nationwide, on all crops except pineapples      (where it supposedly leaves no residue).<br />      <br />      Still, the DBCP that had already been applied didn't go      away. Instead, two years after California declared its ban,      the persistent hydrocarbon turned up in 100 wells that      supply drinking water to area farm communities. As a      result, some state officials have suggested that all      contaminated wells be plugged ... while others feel such      action would be impractical. At this point, then, nothing      has been done about the situation, so DBCP-contaminated      water continues to flow into thousands of San Joaquin      Valley homes and into irrigation systems that supply water      to the nation's leading vegetable-growing region. Another      infamous man-made chemical is dioxin. This potent      herbicide-best known as an ingredient in Agent Orange-is      one of the most toxic substances on earth. (It causes      severe reproductive deformities in monkeys at      concentrations of 50 parts per <em>trillion!)</em> Dioxin      may or may not reduce the quantity of sperm production, but      it clearly seems to have an effect on its <em>quality.</em>      Over a million American soldiers are estimated to have been      exposed to the herbicide during the Vietnam War, and their      children have shown an unexpectedly high rate of birth      defects.<br />      <br />      Nor is that Asian country the only place that this      particular toxin has been used. The chemical 2,4,5-T, which      contains 500,000 parts per trillion of dioxin, was-for      years-sprayed on national forests and highways, power      lines, and railroad rights-of-way across the U.S. In fact,      seven million pounds of 2,4,5-T was used for such purposes      annually ... until the EPA responded to evidence that the      herbicide has caused abnormally high rates of miscarriage      and fetal death among women who lived near sprayed areas.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: See our Plowboy Interview "Bonnie Hill:      Confronting the Chemical Goliaths" on page 16 of issue 72      for a full report on that topic.]</em> And even today the      EPA permits spraying of two million pounds of 2,4,5-T a      year on range- and rice lands.<br />      <br />      Worse still, the catalog of      <em>genotoxins-substances</em> that cause sterility,      sperm abnormalities, or testicular cancer-includes far more      than chemical pesticides and herbicides. Another guilty      substance is plutonium, one of the most potent carcinogens      on earth ... <em>and</em> one that appears to accumulate in      the testicles (in much the same way, for instance, that      radioactive iodine collects in the thyroid gland). Before      1945, no trace of this manmade element existed on earth,      but aboveground atomic weapons tests have dispersed an      estimated 10,000 pounds of the radioactive genotoxin into      the atmosphere. It is believed that <em>all</em> people on      earth today carry detectable levels of plutonium in their      bodies. In 1980 Dr. Carl Johnson, an epidemiologist at the      University of Colorado Medical School, released results of      a survey of cancer rates around the Rocky Flats nuclear      weapons plant (a facility which has recorded many routine,      <em>and</em> accidental, airborne plutonium releases in the      last 25 years). Using National Cancer Institute data,      Johnson found that overall cancer rates were 24% higher in      men living downwind from the plant than in those living      upwind. And the most striking difference concerned      testicular cancer: The men living upwind had 17 cases of      this disease, while those living downwind had 401. Then      again, there's the much less well known genotoxin, DES      (diethylstilbestrol) . . . the synthetic estrogen that has      caused vaginal cancer in some women whose <em>mothers</em>      took the hormone while pregnant. A couple of years ago,      this drug was linked to testicular cancer in DES      <em>sons.</em> A scientist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering      Cancer Center in New York found that 10% of that      institute's testicular cancer patients had documented      histories of DES exposure (a rate <em>three times</em> that      which could normally be expected). DES sons also showed      elevated rates of sperm abnormalities, infertility, and      undescended testicles. Nor are DES users and their      offspring the only people who have been exposed to this      synthetic estrogen. It was routinely added to about 80% of      the animal feed produced in the U.S. from the 1950's      until-because residues were being found in a variety of-      meats-the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned      its use early in 1980. DES is much less commonly      recommended for pregnant women, but <em>10%</em> of' all      American women still take <em>phenobarbital</em> during      pregnancy, to combat nausea. (During the 1960's and 70's,      25% of our nation's expectant mothers used the drug.) Yet      Dr. Sumner Yaffe-of Bethesda, Maryland's Center for      Research for Mothers and Children-found that when      pregnant rats were given the anticonvulsant, only 60% of      their male offspring and just <em>40%</em> of the female      ones were able to sire or bear normal babies! Many      antibiotics, among them penicillin and tetracycline, also      Suppress sperm production. Yet according to a 1974 report      in the <em>American Journal of Urology</em> this effect is      "seldom discussed" in the medical literature. And as DES      once was antibiotics today are fed in large quantities to      the vast majority of' feedlot-fattened livestock. In fact,      in April 1981 the General Accounting Office reported that      14% of commercially sold meat and poultry is contaminated      with illegal antibiotic residues and/or unhealthful      hormones (such as anabolic steroids).<br />      <br />      The list of genotoxins goes on and on. The element      lead-like plutonium-accumulates in the testicles ...      causing genetic damage to sperm by disrupting the zinc      metabolism necessary for normal spermatogenesis.<br />      <br />      And although cigarette advertising associates tobacco      smoking with virility, a growing body of research supports      the opposite that smoking reduces sperm counts. Heavy use      of marijuana has also been linked to similar effects. Even      regular intake of cafleine may have sperm- and      offspring-damaging impact! GENOTOXIC EFFECTS During the      1950's, doctors said that 10% of U.S. couples were      infertile ... and that organic problems in the male      partners ac counted for only 10% of those problems. To day,      a sixth-over 15%-of our nation's married couples are      reportedly infertile, and male dysfunctions are said to      account for 30 to 40% of the difficulties. (However, since      infertility has traditionally been blamed on women, this      increased observance of male dysfunction . in couples could      reflect a belated recognition of long-ignored facts <em>as      well as</em> a new biological trend.)<br />      <br />      There is also some evidence suggesting that men with low      sperm counts are more likely to produce offspring with      birth defects. Erik Jansson, an environmentalist with      Friends of the Earth (who's working on anti-birth-defect      legislation), notes that artificial insemination of women      with frozen sperm from third-party donors results in a      birth defect rate of 1% or less ... in sharp contrast to      the overall American birth defect rate of 4.5 to 6%.      Jansson states that "the most important reason for the      dramatic fall in birth defects with third-party donors of      sperm is that the artificial insemination laboratories      accept <em>only</em> men with high sperm counts . . ." (The      FOE staffer has also concluded that the same findings      "suggest that American men are presently responsible for      between 78 and 83% of all birth defects in the United      States"!)<br />      <br />      In addition, according to the National Cancer Institute,      testicular cancer rates have risen sharply since 1950 ...      doubling in whites and tripling in blacks. Furthermore, the      disease has been striking men earlier in life. A century      ago, most victims were fairly elderly, men. By the late      1950's, however, men under 25 accounted for <em>12%</em> of      the cases . . . and today, such young adults constitute      <em>25%</em> of the victims! In fact, although testicular      cancer accounts for only <em>1 To</em> of all cancers in      men, it has become the <em>most common</em> solid tumor in      males aged 15 to 34.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE THREAD OF LIFE</strong><br />      <br />      Every man alive today is being exposed to pollutants that      are known to diminish his reproductive capacity. And the      number of involuntary "chemical vasectomies" (and other      male reproductive disorders) clearly seems to be on the      rise. So the conclusion is all too plain: Unless      reproductively toxic substances are removed from the      environment, many people now in infancy may encounter      substantial difficulty in obeying one of their most      fundamental biological injunctions: to be fruitful and      multiply .<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Michael Castleman is managing editor      of</em> Medical Self-Care. <em>(See page 100 for more on      that worthy quarterly.)
