                        <p>      <strong>"THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN" REALLY IS:</strong>      According to a study by the Worldwatch Institute (Dept.      TMEN, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C.      20036), some 3.6 million Japanese households-about 11% of      the country's homes-were using solar systems (in most      cases, hot water) by the end of last year. Furthermore, the      government-which backs the alternative technology by      offering homeowners easy-to-obtain cash grants that cover      half the cost of buying and installing solar      heaters-expects the number of solar-equipped buildings to      reach 4.2 million by 1985 ... and 8 million by 1990!<br />      <br />      <strong>THE LARGEST WIND GENERATOR CURRENTLY      PLANNED</strong> will be installed by Hawaiian Electric      Company on Oahu's north coast, near Kahuku, beginning next      year. The 7.3 megawatt, $14.2 million machine, designed by      General Electric, is expected to be operational by 1985 ...      and could supply electricity for as many as 3,500      households, at a cost-it is hoped-of less than five  cents      per kilowatt-hour.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>NUCLEAR OPINION:</strong>      In a recent Harris poll, 51% of the people surveyed said      they are opposed to the construction of new nuclear power      plants (37% are in favor) ... 54% believe that such      facilities are dangerous (41% think the reactors are safe)      ... 75% are concerned about airborne radioactive emissions      ... and 74% view radioactive waste as "a major      problem".<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>YES, YOU CAN BURN COAL IN      CATALYTIC COMBUSTER-EQUIPPED</strong> wood/coal combination      stoves, according to research announced by Fred Noll,      senior product engineer for Corning Glass Works. Noll says      that the sulfur in coal coats-but does not destroy-the      combuster ... and that burning an 1100Â°F wood fire for      one hour will remove the residue. You'll have to leave the      combuster bypass open when burning the black chunks,      though, or the cleaner may become seriously clogged. Only      when burning wood can you actually use your unit's      catalytic cleaner to increase heater efficiency and reduce      exhaust emissions.<br />      <br />      <strong>NUKE KNOWLEDGE:</strong> The Nuclear Control      Institute (Dept. TMEN, 1000 Connecticut Avenue N.W.,      Washington, D.C. 20036) offers two informative publications      for anyone interested in the use and misuse of the      "peaceful" atom. Nuclear Control Index of Congress ($2.00      postpaid) records how your Representatives have voted on      domestic and International nuclear issues. Breeders,      Plutonium, and Nuclear Weapons ($1.00 postpaid) discusses      the potential that commercial breeder-type reactors (which      are now being developed both in this country and abroad)      have for producing weapons-grade plutonium for nuclear      warheads.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>A PROJECT DESIGNED "TO HELP      AN ENTIRE COUNTRY CHANGE ITS ENERGY HABITS"</strong> has      been announced by Volunteers In Technical Assistance      (VITA). The organization has earmarked $3.4 million for a      four-year project to develop prototype alternative energy      technologies-including passive solar, photovoltaic, and      wind-on a widespread basis in the tiny East African country      of Djibouti (population 300,000). It is hoped that the      energy-poor nation may someday serve as a model for      renewable energy development throughout the Third      World.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>A COMPUTERIZED SAILING      SHIP:</strong> That's what The Oilman, an "ordinary" tanker      operating in the North Sea, will become when outfitted with      rigid sails that will be automatically controlled by a      microprocessor to take maximum advantage of wind      conditions. The $247,000 computerized setup will "tie" the      sails into the ship's existing conventional power system      ... and is expected to save the vessel's owners about      $100,000 per year in fuel costs.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>21.9% LESS ENERGY WAS      NEEDED TO MAKE A POUND OF ALUMINUM IN 1982</strong> than in      1972, according to the Aluminum Association, Inc., a trade      organization. In just the second half of last year, claims      the group, more than 90 trillion Btu were saved in the      manufacture of the metal, compared with the same period a      decade ago. Perhaps most significantly, at least 35% of the      reduction is attributed to consumer recycling programs.      Recycling aluminum, says the association, saves      approximately 95% of the energy required to produce the      material from ore.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>MEXICAN BEAN BEETLES THRIVE      IN SULFUR DIOXIDE-POLLUTED AIR,</strong> according to      researcher Patrick Hughes of the Boyce Thompson Institute      in Ithaca, New York. Hughes fumigated test plots of      soybeans with air containing just 0.14 ppm of SO 2 (the      federal standard for the environment is 0.5 ppm) and then      placed Mexican bean beetle larvae on the treated patches      and on untreated plants. The insects munching on fumigated      foliage grew larger than the others ... and the females in      the polluted population actually produced twice as many      eggs as their "clean" cousins!<br />      <br />      <strong>IN 1982. U.S. NUCLEAR REACTORS PRODUCED</strong>      <strong>ONLY 56%</strong> of their rated capacity, for the      fourth year in a row of under-60% performances....      <strong>THE SUN WAS THE STAR OF THE TV SERIES "KNOTS      LANDING"</strong> recently, when a photovoltaic generator      was used to film one episode.... <strong>TWO WORKING      HYDROELECTRIC GENERATORS THAT USE ONLY THE CURRENT FLOWING      THROUGH CITY WATER MAINS</strong> have been installed in      Philipsburg, Montana.... <strong>9,750 SOLAR KING      COLLECTORS OCCUPYING 7.7 ACRES</strong> will make up the      world's largest solar heating system, to be built this year      for Packerlanct Packing Company in Green Bay, Wisconsin....      Over the next six years, the Tactical Air Command of the      U.S. Air Force will spend $44 million on solar projects,      and <strong>EXPECTS SUN POWER TO SUPPLY 25% OF ALL THE      ENERGY USED AT TAC BASES....</strong> Meanwhile, if the      results of reliability tests on contracted Solarex      photovoltaic panels prove satisfactory, <strong>THE U.S.      COAST GUARD WILL CONVERT HALF OF ITS LIGHTED NAVIGATIONAL      AIDS TO PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER</strong> within three to five      years.    </p>
