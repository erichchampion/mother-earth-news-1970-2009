                <p>      This traditional homestead toy can be just as much fun      today as it was many years ago.    </p>                <p>      A generation or so ago, plug poppers similar to the one you      see here were big hits with the little folks come      harvesttime. When the crops were in, you see, culled and      spoiled potatoes (or cucumbers, apples, or any      <em>other</em> "meaty" fruits or vegetables) were fair game      ... as the youngsters "ran them through" with the tips of      their weapons, then propelled the pithy projectile plugs      with a sharp stroke of the pump handle.<br />      <br />      Many of those original spud guns were carved from wood ...      but you can make a modern version of the classic potato      pistol, using a 22" length of 1/2" electrical conduit (this      tube should have an inside diameter of 5/8"), a 5/8" dowel      that's 24" long (you'll probably have to sand it down      slightly), a tricycle handgrip, a No. 8 X 3/4" wood screw      with a matching 3/16" flat washer, several 5/8"-diameter      felt bumper disks, and some electrical or duct tape.      Furthermore, since the thought of volleys of raw vegetables      flying through the house may not appeal to some parents,      we've also called for alternate ammunition, in the form of      a No. 6 cork stopper capped with a 3/4"-diameter plastic      furniture tip (and we'll explain how to keep even      <em>that</em> featherweight slug from causing any harm).    </p>        <p>      The popgun works through air pressure ... and, to contain      that force, you'll need to make a seal for the dowel piston      by fastening up to half a dozen predrilled felt disks to      one end of the rod with a washered wood screw. At the      plunger's opposite end, a few wraps of tape will allow you      to snugly fit a tricycle grip (decorated with streamers if      you choose) in place to serve as a handle.<br />      <br />      Slipping the completed plunger into the conduit barrel      might prove to be a bit tricky unless you first loosen the      screw holding the felt seals in place. Then, once the union      is made, you can tighten the fastener from the open end of      the tube, thus compressing and widening the disks. In      addition, to make sure that the plunger isn't mistakenly      drawn from its barrel, it's best to mark a limit line on      the dowel at a point about 6 inches behind its forward end.      And a bit of oil (or even water) poured into the popper's      "barrel" end will cause the felt to swell, effecting an      even better seal. Once that's done, the toy will be ready      for action.<br />      <br />      If you put your spud gun together according to our      specifications, about 3/4" of conduit should protrude      beyond the plunger's felted end. This casing can be shoved      into a spoiled potato (or what have you) to compress a wad      of material at the business end of the barrel ... or the      tipped cork can be pressed into the opening instead. To      discharge the projectile, simply pull back on the plunger      (but no farther than the marked line) and then ram it      forward so the handgrip stops at the rear of the barrel.      The missile will fly from the spud shooter's muzzle with a      loud pop.<br />      <br />      Of course, common sense dictates that your children be      warned not to shoot their popguns at people or animals ...      but, to play it safe, you might want to modify !he toy by      tying a length of string to the plunger's wood screw, then      stapling the free end to the back of the cork. The altered      popper will <em>still</em> make an impressive noise, but      it'll have far more bark than bite.    </p>
