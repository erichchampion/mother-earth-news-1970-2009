                <p>      <strong><em>Following the axiom of "waste not, want not",      here's a new slant on a Halloween tradition.</em></strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Kathy Kellogg    </h5>        <p>      How many times have you carefully cut out the eyes and the      crooked smile on your Halloween pumpkin ... and then-after      a few days have passed-watched the succulent squash shrink,      shrivel, mold, and rot. "But that's just the price we have      to pay most folks reason. "After all, it's impossible to      have a jack-o'-lantern and a pumpkin pie, too!"<br />      <br />      Well, <em>wait</em> a minute ... who said you <em>have</em>      to cut into that pumpkin? Why not simply decorate its      outside, and then-after the bewitching eve of All Saints'      Day-turn the inside into a scrumptious dessert or      some hearty loaves of bread? True, there won't be any      winking candles or firelit expressions on your Halloween      ghoul ... but I'll bet your young goblins will think that      small "sacrifice" is well rewarded when they bite into a      delicious, moist, custardy piece of pie smothered in      whipped cream!<br />      <br />      <strong>PUMPKIN PAINTING</strong><br />      <br />      It's my bet that youngsters and adults alike will find that      decorating a pumpkin with pens and brushes-as opposed to      carving it-is easier and allows the "artist" more leeway      for creativity. You can even apply your talents to      <em>both</em> sides ... making a jack-o'-lantern with a      "split personality".<br />      <br />      I'd suggest that you begin by drawing a few practice faces      on paper. Remember, though, that small, detailed features      will be difficult to reproduce whether you're painting      <em>or</em> carving. When you come up with a design that      you like, go on to transfer it to your clean, dry squash      with a pencil. After it's drawn the way you want, go over      the pencil lines with a black felt-tipped marker.<br />      <br />      Next, round up some small paintbrushes and choose your      colors. I feel that a combination of bright hues in both      light and dark shades generally looks most effective. You      can use poster, powder, or acrylic paints, felt-tipped      markers, or even interior house paint. (The pumpkins shown      here were decorated with glossy latex enamels.) Water-based      paints, of course, allow an easier cleanup ... but do be      sure that any coloring medium you choose is lead-free, to      avoid possible contamination of the pumpkin meat.<br />      <br />      Start painting those features for which you've planned to      use white or the lightest color, then allow each area to      dry until it's tacky before going on to the next darker      shade. Continue in this manner until you finally get to      black, which can be used to darken the original outlines      and to add such details as eyes or hair. Then let your      creation dry thoroughly (overnight will usually do) before      adding any additional coats of paint.<br />      <br />      You can also create facial features by using toothpicks to      attach fruits and vegetables to your pumpkin. Cranberries,      small gourds, raisins, corn kernels, carrots, cucumbers,      celery, and green beans can all be employed to make unique      jack-o'-lanterns. However, should you plan to later      <em>cook</em> any pumpkin that has toothpick holes, do so      as soon after the holiday as you can ... to prevent      rotting. Your painted versions, on the other hand, can be      stored in the root cellar alongside their undecorated      squash cousins, and they'll keep for months if the skins      aren't broken.<br />      <br />      <strong>FROM GOBLIN TO GOURMET GOODIES</strong><br />      <br />      When you're ready to prepare pumpkin puree, remove as much      paint as possible (a metal pot scrubber works well) from      the squash before cutting it in half. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:      Better yet, completely remove the skin from paint-covered      sections.]</em> Then scrape out the seeds and stringy      fibers with a soup spoon. Next, cut the pumpkin into four      or six uniform pieces, place the sections on a greased      cookie sheet, and bake them at 350'F until they're tender      (it'll take about an hour).<br />      <br />      If you prefer to cook the pumpkin whole, cut an opening in      its top ... remove the pulp and seeds ... replace the "cap"      . . . and bake the squash in a shallow pan-again at      350°F?for 1-1/2 hours or until it's tender. Then remove      the pumpkin from the oven and pour off any collected      liquid. (You can also simply boil I " pieces of the squash      over medium heat for 30 to 45 minutes or until they're      tender.)<br />      <br />      No matter how you cook your jack-o'-lantern, though, be      sure to cool it quickly in cold water and to drain it      thoroughly. Then cut the meat away from the skin and strain      it through a sieve or colander, or use a food mill or a      blender, to remove the lumps and fibers.<br />      <br />      If you prepare more pumpkin puree than you can use in one      cooking session, just pack it into pint or quart jars,      leaving a 3/4" space at the top of each container, and      process the jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds of      pressure (allow 65 minutes for pints and 80 minutes for      quarts). The puree will also keep for several months in      plastic containers in the freezer, or for a day or two in      the refrigerator.<br />      <br />      And now comes the fun part!<br />      <br />      <strong>PERFECT PUMPKIN DISHES</strong><br />      <br />      The following recipes are favorites with my family, and I      hope they'll be pleasing to yours, too!<br />      <br />      <strong><em>PUMPKIN PIE</em></strong><br />      <br />      To make a failproof piecrust, use a pastry cutter or a fork      to cut together 1/2 cup of margarine, butter, rendered      lard, or vegetable shortening, 2 cups of whole wheat flour,      and 1/4 teaspoon of salt ... until the mixture forms      pea-sized balls. Now, in a small bowl, combine I large egg,      I tablespoon of vinegar (plain or cider), and 3 tablespoons      of cold water. Add this to the flour mixture, a little at a      time, until the dough holds the form of a ball. (If needed,      add more cold water, but do so a drop at a time.), Finally,      divide the dough into two balls, roll each one out on a      breadboard or wax paper that you've dusted with flour, and      use them to line two 9 " pie plates.<br />      <br />      To prepare the filling, mix 4 well-beaten eggs, 3 cups of      pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup of honey, 1/2 cup of molasses, I      teaspoon <em>each</em> of salt, cinnamon, and ginger, 1/2      teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon of cloves, and 3-1/2 cups      of light cream. Pour this into the unbaked crusts, and bake      the pies at 425°F for 15 minutes. Then reduce the      temperature to 350°F and let them cook for another 45      or 50 minutes, or until the custard is set and a knife      inserted near the center comes out clean. To avoid      overcooking the pies, remove them from the oven while their      centers are still <em>slightly</em> liquid (they'll finish      baking as they cool). Cool them on racks in a draft-free      spot, and store them, covered, in the refrigerator      ...<br />      <br />      until you're ready to serve the treats with whipped      cream.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE PIE</strong></em><br />      <br />      To make the crust for <em>this</em> special dessert, cream      1/3 cup of butter with 1/3 cup of brown sugar. Then add I      medium egg and beat the ingredients with a fork until      they're fluffy. Next, mix in 1-1/4 cups of whole wheat      flour until you've produced a crumbly dough. Press this on      the bottom and sides of a greased 9 " to 10 " pie plate, 9      " round cake pan, or shallow 9" springform pan, and bake      the crust at 400°F for 5 minutes (don't overcook it)      before removing it from the oven to cool.<br />      <br />      Now, combine 16 ounces of softened cream cheese and 1 cup      of honey, and mix them until the combination is fluffy and      well blended. Then add 2 cups of pumpkin puree, I teaspoon      of cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon each of ginger and nutmeg,      and?again-stir the ingredients well. With that done, pour      the filling into the crust and bake the cheesecake at      350°F for 50 to 60 minutes, or until it's firm in the      center. Finally, cool it on a rack ... chill it ... and      serve it garnished with whipped cream.<br />      <br />      <strong><em>PUMPKIN BREAD</em></strong><br />      <br />      In a large bowl, combine I cup of vegetable oil, 2 cups of      brown sugar, 1 cup of honey, 1/2 cup of molasses, and 3      cups of pumpkin puree. Then, in another bowl, mix 2-1/2      cups of unbleached white flour, 3 cups of whole wheat      flour, 4 teaspoons of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of salt, 2      teaspoons of cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves. Add the      dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture and stir everything      well (it'll be a bit stiff). Now, add 2 cups of chopped      nuts, 2 cups of raisins, and 1 cup of chopped dates. Pour      the batter into three greased 5" X 9" loaf pans, and bake      the breads at 350°F for 55 to 65 minutes, or until a      toothpick inserted into each of their centers comes out      clean. Then remove the loaves from the pans and cool them      on a rack. Once the breads reach room temperature, wrap      them in aluminum foil and chill them. Serve your pumpkin      bread in thin slices spread with softened butter or cream      cheese (or both).<br />      <br />      I can almost guarantee that, as you cut into any one of      these treats, you'll be glad that you spared the knife when      <em>creating</em> your jack-o'-lantern ... and saved that      blade for <em>serving</em> it!    </p>
