    <p>
                            <p>      There's one good reason not to transplant asparagus: It's a      lot of work! However, it's also the <em>only</em> way to      get full production in the first spring following planting.    </p>    <p>      My original asparagus patch, for example, was started with      two-year-old commercial plants. But five years later, I      transplanted some ten-year-old crowns from a neighbor's      garden, and when spring rolled around, these transplants-in      spite of having been recently moved-actually outproduced      the younger (seven years old), established plants. What's      more, they were free for the digging.    </p>    <p>      But (naturally!) there is one catch: If you don't know just      how to handle the scavenged plants, your only reward will      be improved muscle tone from all the additional gardening      exercise. And should you consult the "experts" for advice,      most of them will simply tell you that it's easier to buy      new plants.    </p>    <p>      Well, <em>of course</em> it's easier, but you may have more      energy than money ... you may not want to wait several      years for the payoff ... or your present patch may have      become overcrowded and so unproductive that it won't      satisfy your family's appetite for this delicious,      healthful spring crop. (Just 100 grams of asparagus      contains 2.2 grams of protein and at least 900 units of      vitamin A and beta-carotene, a component that many people      feel has great potential as a cancer preventive.)'    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINDING TRANSPLANT<br />      CANDIDATES<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      If you don't have a crowded "sparrowgrass" patch of your      own to raid for transplants, you'll have to search one out.      Fortunately, this perennial is quite hardy, and will live      for years on abandoned homesteads. When such a site has      enough rainfall to nurture old fruit trees, any asparagus      that's been planted has probably survived as well.      (Remember, even <em>abandoned</em> farms belong to someone,      so seek out permission be <em>fore</em> you start digging.)    </p>    <p>      In drier parts of the country, "wild" asparagus, which is      simply the wayward offspring of the garden plant, is      sometimes found along streams and irrigation banks.      Neighbors' plots can often provide sources of transplants,      too. Although a properly tended bed can be productive for      up to 50 years, it will become overcrowded long before      that. In fact, if an old plot is dug up and the plants are      divided, it will supply enough crowns to plant an area      larger than the original patch, and-as a bonus-that same      space will actually produce <em>more</em> edible shoots      after it's been thinned. Therefore, one of the best ways to      get plants of known quality is to exchange the time and      labor spent thinning and replanting another gardener's      patch for a share of the extra plants. Take heed, though      ... you might wind up with more asparagus than you know      what to do with. I once dug up an 18-inch-diameter clump      that yielded more than 250 plants (at least we found out      why it wasn't bearing!).<br />    </p>    <p>      Asparagus can be transplanted at any time during its      dormant period, as long as the ground isn't frozen. And      while many people like to undertake this task in the early      spring, I've found that this causes the bearing season to      be a bit delayed, at least as compared with that of those      transplanted in the fall.    </p>    <p>      Actually, having the right tools (and using them carefully)      will have a lot more to do with your success than will your      decision as to whether to transplant in spring or autumn.      You'll need a shovel or spade, a garden fork, and a      mattock. (If you don't have a garden fork, you <em>can</em>      make do with a shovel, but-since you'll have to take a good      bit of extra care not to bruise or to cut the roots' tender      tissue-using a shovel alone makes a long job seem downright      endless. In addition, because a fork will allow some dirt      to slip through its tines, that tool will be easier on your      back.) A crowbar may also come it handy for loosening the      larger clumps and-in anything but extremely sandy      soil-a garden hose is useful during the final      root-tracing-and-dividing process.<br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>GET 'EM UP</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      When you've found your source of transplants,      <em>don't</em> just start in shoveling, or you're apt to      cut the roots badly. Instead work on one clump at a time,      and begin by inspecting the dead foliage from the previous      year to determine the exact location o the crowns. These      will be concentrate( among the clusters of dried seed      stalks, an( must be treated with care. (After all, it's the      crowns that will send up edible spears the following      spring.)    </p>    <p>      Working carefully, use the spading fork to "explore" a      circle of ground that extends 6 to 12 inches from the outer      edge of the group of dead stems. After you've determined      how far the main mass of the root system reaches, you can      use the shovel to dig a circle around it. This trench      should generally be about one spade's depth, but it's best      to check to see how deep the root structure goes and to dig      accordingly.    </p>    <p>      You'll have to continue working around the mass until you      start to tunnel <em>under</em> the root system. You might      as well accept the fact, however, that you won't be able to      get it all out intact. Rather, the object is to save as      much of the "fat" root system as possible, because it      contains the stored food that will help insure the plant's      survival. Many of the small, hairlike feeder roots will      likely be accidentally stripped during the digging/      transplanting process, but the plant can replace some of      these without suffering <em>too</em> much harm.<br />    </p>    <p>      If the clump is relatively small, you might be able to      loosen and lift it with the spading fork. An older mass,      however, will often have to be pried out with the mattock      ... and a <em>really</em> large and/or overcrowded section      may require a mattock, a crowbar, <em>and</em> all of the      ingenuity you can muster. But whatever tool(s) you're      using, make sure that you work the implement <em>under</em>      the roots instead of cutting through them or-worse      still-slicing into the crowns. Once the tool is in place      under the root mass, move around the trench-prying      <em>gently</em> at a number of points-until the clump can      be lifted out whole.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes the plants in an old bed may be too closely      intertwined to remove by simple circling and lifting. In      that case, your best bet will be to start at the end of a      row or the corner of a bed, and use the spading fork, as      before, to locate the edges of the tangled root clumps.      Then, to find the dividing line between the intersecting      roots of two adjacent systems, insert the fork-from the      side-at a point about halfway between the clumps' suspected      centers and lift gently. If you've found the right spot,      the ground will break above the tines as the two root      masses pull apart. When you meet resistance, move a bit to      one side and try again ... always working from the edge      toward the center, and inserting the tool gently to avoid      damaging any roots. If you meet <em>no</em> resistance when      prying, move in closer and try again.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIVIDE THE SPOILS<br /></strong> <strong>(WITHOUT      SPOILING THEM)<br /></strong><br />      When the asparagus is finally out of the ground, you can      begin to evaluate your prizes. If the soil is sandy, most      of it will have fallen from the roots by this point ... but      clay may hang on and will have to be washed off before the      untangling job can begin. (A gentle hosing will remove the      dirt and cause less damage than would trying to shake or      claw the earth off.)    </p>    <p>      A mature plant will have a large, healthy crown with,      perhaps, some smaller crowns loosely connected to it. The      roots will be large, too, but not tightly packed. When      you're fortunate enough to find an asparagus of this type,      all you'll have to do is pull away the extra plants before      transferring it to its new home.<br />    </p>    <p>      An overcrowded clump is- altogether another story, though.      It will likely be a real mess, with a lot of stunted plants      jammed tightly together. The roots of one may even grow      through the crown of another. In such a case, the      transplanter pretty much has to settle for a salvage      operation. When you can't save <em>all</em> of the plants,      you have to try for the best and sacrifice the rest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PREPARING A NEW HOME</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      When your asparagus roots are cleared and separated, you'll      have to determine where to put them. (I'm sure that the      plan-ahead types reading this will wonder why this point      wasn't brought up before ... but there's no way to know how      many plants you'll have to relocate until you actually dig      them up!)    </p>    <p>      The commonly quoted rule of thumb says that you'll want at      least a half-dozen plants for each member of your family.      (However, I think a full dozen apiece would be closer to      the truth.) Your needs will vary, of course, according to      how much your clan <em>likes</em> asparagus. Then again, if      you want to preserve some, it's best to plant extra ... and      hope that the to-be- saved-for-later spears don't end up on      the spring luncheon menu.    </p>    <p>      In choosing a suitable place to plant, remember that you      may well be picking from that location for the next couple      of decades. Since asparagus will grow in almost any kind of      soil, though, the only type of plot you'll have to      <em>avoid is</em> one that retains excessive moisture.    </p>    <p>      It's best to allow from 18 to 30 inches between plants in      each row, and from 3 to 5 feet between rows. If your      planting area is limited, you might try placing the root      clumps at the corners of equilateral triangles with 18-inch      sides ... but <em>don't</em> plant them any closer together      than that, unless you want to redo the whole thing in a      couple of years!    </p>    <p>      If you're concerned about your asparagus taking up too much      of your garden plot, you can use the open spaces between      your root clumps to grow annual vegetables for a few years.      (Carrots, turnips, spinach, radishes, beets, and kohlrabi      are good choices for this.) Just don't place these "guests"      so close that they interfere with the development of the      permanent crop, because asparagus <em>has</em> to have a      lot of breathing room. Always keep in mind that while this      perennial can easily become crowded, there's no way you can      get its shoots too far apart, because they don't require      cross-pollination. Individual asparagus plants can even be      scattered throughout an orchard or in flowerbeds.<br />    </p>    <p>      If you want to plant the roots in groups, dig an 18- to      24-inch-deep bed. Otherwise, just prepare individual holes.      Next, spread about 6 inches of well-rotted manure or      compost in the bottom of the hole/trench/ bed, and cover it      with a layer of dirt. The thickness of this soil layer      will, of course, depend upon the size of the root system      ... but be sure to make the final level of the ground about      3 inches above the asparagus crowns. (Small plants may have      only a few thin roots to be arranged horizontally on top of      a thick layer of soil. A mature one, however, may have a      6-inch root mass extending down from its crown.)    </p>    <p>      Once the plant is placed in the depression, sift earth over      it gently, keeping the roots spread out widely ... pack      this soil down firmly but carefully ... then water the      asparagus ... and wait. (If you plant in the fall, it's      best to cover the crop with leaves or litter, which you      should remove in the spring.)<br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>KEEP 'EM HAPPY</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      By moving older plants, you can bypass the early,      unproductive years and enjoy a full harvest the following      spring. However, <em>you'll also</em> have to watch for      overcrowding much sooner than you would with a "new" bed.      If the spears start getting smaller with the passing years,      the clumps should probably be divided once again. For the      most part, asparagus does an excellent rob of taking care      of itself, although it will appreciate water during dry      periods ... as well as an occasional top-dressing of manure      when the plants are dormant. (You should also keep the      ground loose around the young shoots at all times, and      cultivate to a depth of I inch to keep down the weeds.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>HARVESTING HINTS</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      And just how will you know when your asparagus is ready to      harvest? Well, surprisingly enough, the plants themselves      will tell you. Seedlings put up only fernlike leaf stalks,      you see, while a yearling patch may produce tiny spears.      (The thin ones--smaller around than a pencil-are certainly      edible, but they may be a bit stringy.) When you decide      that your shoots are big enough for eating, be aware that      careless cutting can injure or destroy undeveloped spears      that are still below the ground. One good way to harvest is      simply to snap off the stalks by bending them across your      index finger with your thumb. In addition, don't      <em>ever</em> cut the mature leaf stalks until after the      first frost, as they perform the photosynthesis that gives      this wonderful vegetable the strength to feed you year      after year.    </p>
