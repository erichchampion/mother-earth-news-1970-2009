                <p>      Better "sitting posture- can take a lot of the backache out      of those long work hours.    </p>            <p>      <em>MOTHER's research into pedal-driven vehicles has,      understandably enough, left our shop cluttered with surplus      bike frames and parts. The bicycle desk you see here was      assembled from those -leftovers". By welding a spare set of      dropped handlebars to the rear-axle dropouts of a bike      frame, then reversing the existing bars and mounting a      writing</em> I <em>platform with conduit clips, you can      make</em> <em>a one-of-a-kind outdoor study station that      can be adjusted-just like a bicycle?to fit the      "wrider".</em>    </p>    <p>      If a good part of your day is spent sitting, chances are      you know how fatiguing that so-called"rest" position can      be. And despite the fact that chairs of all types have been      designed over the years to suit specific needs, none that      we know of have successfully addressed the fundamental      problem of encouraging ideal posture ... until recently.    </p>        <p>      We're referring, of course, to the backless stools you've      probably seen displayed in current popular magazines.      Consisting of just a seat and two knee supports, these      chairs are said to ease breathing, encourage circulation,      and improve posture ... all by virtue of the fact that they      force the user to sit upright with his or her thighs      slanting toward the floor, thus loosening the cramped angle      at the waist that results from sitting in a conventional      chair.<br />      <br />      As you might expect, these well-finished pieces of      furniture are expensive ... some costing nearly $200. But      by following our design (using inexpensive materials and,      for the most part, a few basic tools), you can make your      own "posture platform" that-though it won't be the      <em>same</em> as the ready-made chairs-is actually a tad      more versatile, because it's a desk-and-seat      <em>combination.</em><br />      <br />      To start, you'll need these materials: a piece of 3/4"      plywood measuring 15" X 18" to make the foundations for the      seat and the knee pad ... a second section of 3/4" plywood      that's 20" X 32" for the desk surface (if you don't mind      searching for a bargain, sink-top<br />      <br />      cutouts are usually available-from cabinet shops,      lumberyards, or even local flea markets?at scrap prices,      and they're already surfaced with a laminate) ... a 3" X      18" X 25" hunk of foam rubber padding ... a 30" X 36"      length of upholstery material . , . some fabric adhesive      (you could use tacks or staples to secure the covering      instead) ... seven 1 " conduit clips ... an equal number of      No. 8 X 1-3/4" roundhead wood screws ... and three I      10-foot lengths of 1 " electrical metallic tubing      <em>(E.M.T.).</em><br />      <br />      Once you've collected all of these items, you can begin      forming the desk's conduit base. (To do the job neatly,      you'll need to buy or borrow a I" conduit bender, since the      support's arcs should be accurately shaped and      symmetrical.) The large platform is to be braced by two      legs, each of which is the mirror image of the other. Start      at a point 3 inches from one end of a complete section of      conduit, and form an acute-angle bend that absorbs 16" of      material (this will eventually support the knee pad). Then      leave a 5" straight section, and make a second arc-this one      90* and 12" long-that's offset from the plane of the first      by 151 or so. The third bend, beginning after a straight      stretch of 14", should consume about 12" of tubing and      describe a 950 angle, and-after only an inch-the final      (90") arc should be formed <em>perpendicularly</em> to the      third.<br />      <br />      Naturally, the opposite leg should be formed to the same      dimensions, and must match its mate ... then the two      butting ends can be trimmed so that the legs' upper      (desk-supporting) siderails are 27 inches apart, while the      lower rails should be separated by a distance of      approximately 14 inches.<br />      <br />      To shape the tubular seat support, take your final length      of conduit and find its center. Then form-to the right and      left of this point-similar structures, each with the      following references: a 12" right-angle arc followed by an      18" straight section ... a 12" 115Â° bend that's      perpendicular to the initial curve ... 4" of unbent stock      ... an 850 arc 10 in length ... and, finally, about 4" of      straight stub.<br />      <br />      When you've shaped the conduit, you can go to work on the      seat and cushion. Cut your smaller slab of plywood into two      pieces -one 3/4" X 5" X 18", and the other 3/4" X 10" X      18"?then slice the foam padding to match those boards (the      10" X 18" seat will require two layers of cushioning).      Round the corners of the plywood platforms, glue the foam      sections to their respective bases, and-while the adhesive      is drying-trim your upholstery material to fit the pads.      (The seat will require a 22" X 30" piece, and the knee      cushion a 14" X 27" section.)<br />      <br />      Rather than get involved with intricate stitching, we used      a simple tuck-and-fold technique when securing the fabric.      Each cushion's end flaps were fastened to the bottom of the      base first, then the longer side skirts were folded inward      and secured, with the corners tucked beneath them (the      process was similar to wrapping a package).<br />      <br />      With this done, you can test the fit of the various parts      before completing the assembly process. Start by clamping      the "nose" of the seat frame against the heels of the      knee-support frame (see the diagram), then temporarily      setting the two pads in place. Once the conduit clips are      fastened to the cushion bases at the proper locations (the      clamps make the pads adjustable), the tabletop can be      positioned as well.<br />      <br />      If you're satisfied with the fit, you can remove the      cushions and tack-weld or braze the clamped joints and the      butted joint at the top of the frame, then finish up by      painting the conduit. If the position's not comfortable,      use your E.M.T. bender to adjust the arcs to suit the desk      to your body, then complete the joints, painting, and the      final assembly. The result will be a unique piece of      furniture that's comfortable and functional ... for a very      reasonable $25 or so.    </p>
