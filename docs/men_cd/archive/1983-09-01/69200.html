                <p>      Here are some beautiful ways to achieve energy savings in      your home.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Stan Warshaw    </h5>		<p>		I'm sure you've heard the expression "It's not the heat,    it's the humidity" used in reference to someone's state of    summertime misery. Well, there's often a lot of truth to that    statement. Discomfort in warm weather is usually influenced    by the amount of moisture in the air. Hence, many folks    firmly believe that drier air is cooler air.<br />    <br />    It stands to reason, then, that this same philosophy of    comfort can be turned around and used to <em>encourage</em>    the feeling of warmth within the interior of your home during    the coming cold months. In fact, a relative wintertime indoor    humidity of between 40% and 50% is desirable. Unfortunately,    most artificial heating systems zap the natural moisture from    your indoor environment. One possible way to counteract the    escalating cost of home heating is to deliberately    <em>increase</em> the relative humidity in your house ... a    practice that will make you feel more comfortable at a lower    thermostat setting.<br />    <br />    There are, of course, several ways of doing this. One popular    method is to simply place pans of water on radiators, on    woodstoves, or near fireplaces ... so the liquid evaporates    and thus adds moisture to the air. However, the plain truth    is that many contemporary homes-although fully    insulated-simply aren't equipped to hold in humidity. Any    method used to increase a dwelling's interior "wetness" will    usually be less than fully successful unless some form of    vapor barrier is used to keep the moistened air from escaping    through the walls to the colder, drier outside environment.    There are many such barriers on the insulation market that    are placed between the interior and exterior walls ... and    even paint is available (such as Insul-Aid, which is    manufactured by Glidden) that'll protect your walls against    moisture loss.<br />    <br />    Perhaps best of all, for those who want to combine function    with beauty and versatility, there's a large selection of    wall coverings on the market today that can be very effective    against the loss of interior humidity ... and some of these    combine vapor barriers with either heat-reflective materials    or thermal insulation. The accompanying chart describes some    of the many choices available, and provides information on    thermal value, vapor barrier qualities, primer requirements,    adhesives, and installation methods.<br />    <br />    One of these coverings could be just the thing to help you    have your heat ... and humidity too!<br />    <br /></p>
