                           <h5 id="byline">by Copthorne Macdonald</h5> 	<h3>THE NDR      DIRECTORY IS OUT!</h3>      <p>      Thanks to the combined efforts of several NDR volunteers,      the New Directions Radio Directory has been compiled and      printed ... and is now ready for mailing! The 12-page      "first edition" contains 75 personal listings submitted by      NDR enthusiasts living in 29 states of the U.S. (plus a few      from Canada, Sweden, and England!).<br />      <br />      You may recall that the proposal to prepare such a      directory was first made in MOTHER NO. 78 ... when Harry      Spetla (KA2DRE) noted that it would be a good idea to put      together a list of people who share the NDR philosophy. He      suggested that the directory should include addresses,      phone numbers, and brief descriptions of the current      interests and activities of these like-minded radio      enthusiasts. Thinking Harry had a good idea, Lee Branum      (KL71JG) and I did what we could to get the word out that      such a publication was in the works. When listings started      coming in, I took care of what little editing was needed      ... and then used my computer to produce camera-ready      copy.<br />      <br />      In addition to Lee's and my efforts, Cassandra Trimble      contributed several cartoons ... Arnold Timm supplied some      sample NDR logos ... and Paul Rosenberg (KA2POY) printed,      collated, and stapled the initial pressrun. And now, Harry      is taking care of the mailing, money, and most everything      else! (Thanks are also due to the many people who donated      to the "seed fund" that covered our start-up      expenses.)<br />      <br />      There are, of course, many more NDR folks than those listed      in this first directory. It's a real shame that everyone      didn't get in, but some people probably didn't hear about      it, while others very likely forgot to write up a listing      and mail it. I admit that I was tempted to add more names,      but I resisted that impulse, figuring that being included      in the NDR directory should, after all, be your decision      and not mine! However, if you were one of those left      out-and would like to be includedwhy not sit down and      compose a listing right now) Send it to Harry (see the      address below), along with your order for a copy of the      first edition. (Naturally, I can't promise there'll be a      second edition ... but I strongly suspect there will      be!)<br />      <br />      To receive your copy of the New Directions Radio Directory,      send $2.00 (U.S.) to Harry Spetla, Dept. TMEN, RD 1, Box      185, Hoosick Falls, New York 12090. (If you live outside      the U.S., please send an extra dollar to help defray      postage costs.)</p>      <h3>FALL NUT SCHEDULE</h3>			    <p> Let's face it: Indoor activities-even radio      transmittingjust can't compete with such summer delights as      gardening, swimming, and camping. But as we settle back      into the autumn routine again, most of us hams are finding      that radio is creeping back up our priority lists! In fact,      September is (in a sense) the start of a new radio season      ... so this seems like a good time to update the schedule      of NDR on-air activities!<br />      <br />      Many nets are still operating at the same times and on the      same days, but there are a few changes.<br />      <br />      For one, after a period of inactivity, Enos Schera (W4VPD)      plans to resume his role as net control station and      facilitator of the Alternate Sources of Energy Net on      Sunday afternoons. And, for another, Jim Bandy (WA3HKR)      hopes that you'll join him on NDR CW Net, Tuesday evenings      at 9 PM Eastern Time, just inside the 40-meter Novice band      ... on about 7100.5 kHz. (If you don't hear anyone, try      calling CQ NDR yourself.)<br />      <br />      Also, ASCII transmission of the NDR On-Air Bulletin is      moving to the same 14095 kHz frequency used by W1AW for      bulletin transmissions. The NDR Bulletin will be sent      immediately after completion of the W1AW ASCII bulletins,      on Tuesday evenings at about 6:20 PM Eastern Time.<br />      <br />      And finally, the Plenty Net-run by The Farm, in Summertown,      Tennessee-now meets Monday through Saturday, from 11      AM to 2 PM Central Time on 21332 kHz. (If you don't hear      them, try calling exactly on the hour.)</p>      <h3>SATELLITE TV</h3>      <p>      Speaking of The Farm ... its electronics and publishing      groups have done it again! Remember The Big Dummy's - Guide      to C.B. Radio (that humorous, informative book written by      The Farm's radio crew a few years back)? It sold over a      million copies, because it was truly helpful to the      would-be CBer. Now, Mark Long (WA4LXC) and Jeffrey Keating      have written a similarly valuable volume for satellite TV      enthusiasts ... The World of Satellite Television      (available through Mother's Bookshelf"' for $9.95 plus      $1.25 shipping and handling ... see page 120 for ordering      information). Its 16 chapters are packed with answers to      the questions that anyone seriously thinking about setting      up an earth station might have. For example, one section      listsin detail-the type and source of programming being      relayed by each of 14 major satellites, while other      chapters are devoted to receivers ... dishes ... feed horns      ... legal questions ... owner installation . . . satellite      audio services ... and international satellite      systems.<br />      <br />      For many people, a satellite receiver is simply an      electronic ticket to more sports and movies. But Mark and      Jeffrey see something else in it: A satellite receiver,      they point out, can make unedited news feeds, programs      geared to minority audiences, and even programming from      other countries available to viewers. As the pair notes,      "In a society where information is increasingly becoming      the medium of exchange, instantaneous global communication      is causing profound changes in our awareness. Boundaries of      money, nationality, time, and space are dissolving in the      cooperative linkage of the entire world, which is sharing      the resources and technology of space."</p>      <h3>LAST WORD</h3>      <p>      The chart accompanying this column provides a fairly      complete schedule of the currently planned New Directions      Radio on-air activities.<br />      <br />      Peace,<br />      Cop Macdonald (VE1BFL)<br />      P.O.
