                <p>      This winter, provide visiting wildfowl with suppers worth      singing for by serving ...    </p>    <h1 id=" title">      WHOLESOME (AND FREE!) BIRD FEED    </h1>          <h5 id="byline">by Sheila W. Lantz</h5>      <p>      My family and I derive a lot of pleasure from feeding the      wild birds wintering on and around our Pennsylvania      farmstead. Not only is it enchanting to watch the many      varieties of feathered songsters that gather around our      bird feeder every year ... but it's also gratifying to know      that-in our own small way-we're contributing to the      well-being of some of Mother Nature's most delightful      creatures.<br />      <br />      Furthermore, we've found that-during the late summer and      early fall-the countryside around our home is a cornucopia      of weeds, wildflowers, fruit, and grasses. And these      free-for-the-gathering "crops" can provide banquets for a      whole winter's worth of voracious birds. There's enough      diversity to please even the most persnickety of palates,      too! If you're like my family and me-and your heart goes      out to the small feathered beings that will soon be huddled      on snowy tree limbs, but your budget won't stretch far      enough for you to buy commercial birdseed-then get out your      foraging gear (actually, any old sack or bucket will do)      ... put on your walking shoes ... and start scouring the      fields, creek banks, and roadsides!<br />      <br />      <strong>"O THOU WEED"</strong><br />      <br />      Of all the different types of wild-growing avian feed, weed      seeds are perhaps the most plentiful and the easiest to      collect. Moreover, game birds relish them, as do songbirds.      Indeed, although the scientific term for ragweed (that bane      of hay fever sufferers) is <em>Ambrosia,</em> or "food for      the gods", it could be called "food for the birds", since      its seeds are so popular with wild turkey and grouse in the      frozen months. You'll find the weed-which can be recognized      by its tri-lobed leaves and tiny green flowers-growing      along roadsides and in fields. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: If you      need help in identifying plants (or birds), you may want to      stop at your local bookstore and pick up copies of the      Audubon Society's wildflower and bird guides that are      pertinent to your region.]</em><br />      <br />      Some game birds, pheasants in particular, like smartweed      <em>(Polygonum hydropiperoides)</em> seeds, which in times      past were gathered and ground into meal as a substitute for      buck wheat. Generally found by the roadside, the plant is      characterized by small pinkish flowers and swollen leaf      joints (which were seen as a "signature" by early doctors,      who prescribed smartweed in treating arthritis, rheumatism,      and gout).<br />      <br />      Another favorite among our winter boarders is wild      amaranth, commonly called pigweed. I can't say how popular      it is with <em>pigs,</em> but the coarse, hairy,      stout-stemmed plant bears lots of tiny black seeds that      certainly are sought after by many species of      <em>birds!</em><br />      <br />      <strong>"THE FRUIT OF LOYAL NATURE.</strong><br />      <br />      To attract robins, mockingbirds, and cedar waxwings to our      "tea table", we add several handfuls of sumac berries to      the menu. However, if you have this colorful plant growing      in your area of the country, be sure that you pick only the      red berries of the staghorn sumac and <em>avoid</em> the      white fruit of the poison sumac! (While you're out      collecting for your winged wonders, you may want to gather      an extra bucketful of the sweet red clusters for your      family, because-when the berries are crushed, steeped in      boiling water, and strained-they make a yummy "Indian      lemonade" that can be served hot or cold.)<br />      <br />      You're probably already aware that hummingbirds (and other      nectar seekers) are fond of the juice of the trumpet      honeysuckle blossoms <em>(Lonicera sempervirens),</em> but      did you know that bobwhites and catbirds enjoy the red      berries that this bush produces in autumn . . , or that-for      yet another songster supper-you can pluck the dark, glossy      berries of the red-stemmed poke plant <em>(Phytolacca      americana)?</em> Even though most folks consider them to be      poisonous to humans, these delicacies will be safely      savored by wrens and cardinals.<br />      <br />      <strong>FIELDS AND FLOWERS</strong><br />      <br />      Sunflower seeds are just about at the top of the list of      all-time favorite foods for wild birds. They crave the oil      (which Native Americans once used to dress their hair) as      it provides protein, fat, and a coating for feathers that      helps ward off harsh weather. Black-eyed Susans, asters,      snapdragons, blazing stars, cornflowers, and chicory all      vie for second place in attracting finches and sparrows to      harvest their seeds.<br />      <br />      Besides wildflowers, fruits, and weed seeds, don't pass up      the ample supply of seed-bearing <em>grasses</em> you're      bound to run across! Millet, flax, barley, wheat, oats      (yes, these actually <em>do</em> grow wild), and even good      old lawnmarring crabgrass are welcomed by blackbirds,      starlings, pigeons, and members of the bunting group ...      while buckwheat satisfies the taste buds of doves and      quail.<br />      <br />      <strong>DINNER IS SERVED!</strong><br />      <br />      Once your sack or pail is filled to the brim with weeds and      flowers and whatnot, take the harvest of free food home and      dry it, to preserve it for the winter "eating season". It's      usually best to bunch the plants in groups of five, placing      a rubber band around the stems of each clump, and then      hanging the bouquets upside down from a beam or rack in an      area of your house that gets good air circulation and a      modicum of heat (your attic, the furnace room, or the      kitchen, perhaps). Leave the bunches dangling until about      midwinter. By that time, your winged neighbors will      probably be more than ready for a treat.<br />      <br />      And after you offer them this cost-free feast, don't be      surprised if your homestead is rapidly invaded by a great      variety of birds ... including some species you may never      have seen before: brownheaded cowbirds that walk about with      tails held high ... towhees, which look something like      robins and sing "Drink your tea!" . . . and brown creepers,      whose stiff tails act as props when they climb up trees as      if the trunks were spiral staircases.<br />      <br />      Feeding the birds may not be the most <em>important</em>      task you'll perform this winter, but it sure could be one      of the most <em>entertaining!</em> Many a snowbound      afternoon will be enlivened by the sight of playful      goings-on outside your window ... as dozens of birds gather      round to feast on the banquet you've provided for      them!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Dont undertake a winter bird-feeding      program unless - you're prepared to keep at it until      spring, as Your handouts will</em> <em>come to be counted      on</em> ... <em>and suffering (or even starvation) can      result if the 'free lunch " is suddenly discontinued.</em>    </p>
