                <p>      Largely unknown in our country, this wonder food deserves      top billing!    </p>            <h5 id="byline">      by Helen Prescott    </h5>    <p>      Okara. <em>Oh-kar'-ah.</em> The name is unfamiliar to most      people in the United States, but it ought to be as well      known as sweet corn! Nutty-flavored, low in fat, and high      in protein and fiber, this versatile bean meal is possibly      the most nutritious <em>and</em> inexpensive food available      to the American consumer today.<br />      <br />      Okara is a by-product of the making of all soy "dairy"      foods. After the soaked beans are ground to a fine mash and      cooked in water, the strained concoction yields soymilk and      okara in a 2:1 ratio. In commercial operations, the creamy      liquid is used to make bean ice cream, soy yogurt, and tofu      ... but the nutritious meal is frequently given away as      livestock feed.<br />      <br />      Lucky critters! According to William Shurtleff, coauthor of      <em>The Book</em> of Tofu, okara contains a      <em>higher-quality</em> protein than its sister soy foods:      tofu, soymilk, and soy whey. You see, although the pulp      retains only about 170% of the original protein, the amino      acids in it are more equally balanced, thereby forming a      complete and very absorbable protein. Calculations done by      Frank and Rosalie Hurd, the authors of <em>Ten      Talents,</em> reveal that just one cup of moist pulp      contains approximately seven grams of protein, or about as      much as one large egg. And that same cup offers you      substantial amounts of iron, calcium, phosphorus, and      vitamin A ... in a mixture that's extremely high in fiber      and almost devoid of fat.<br />      <br />      <strong>HOW TO USE IT, WHERE TO GET IT</strong><br />      <br />      Third World peoples who cook with soybeans commonly dry the      strained meal, grind it into flour, and use it as we do      wheat flours (although okara contains no gluten). However,      in this country, most soy products are "disguised" in      commercial preparations, and very few are actually used in      home kitchens. (The underappreciated soybean has only      recently been welcomed at the U.S. dinner table, and it      still suffers from an "image problem".) Consumers are just      beginning to cook with tofu and to season with miso. And      okara? Why, that sounds too exotic for most Westerners to      even <em>consider</em> using. As a result, the      ever-increasing number of American soy-food factories      simply cannot market all of the bean meal they produce.      Michigan tofu-maker Pam Klingbail, for instance, uses a      small portion of her bean pulp to make a tasty "soysage"      (soy sausage). Some of the remaining mash is also given      away to bakers ... but most of it, she concedes, goes to      farmers for high-class livestock feed.<br />      <br />      What a pity, because-as the following recipes and      suggestions will prove-okara can be added without      hesitation to breads, cereals, and desserts. The unsung soy      food-which, when dried and ground, can substitute for up to      half the flour in baked goods-blends right in, contributing      (in addition to nutritional value) moistness and perhaps a      touch of nutlike flavor.<br />      <br />      If you'd like to try this unique food, just contact a soy      factory near you, and ask the business to save you a small      bucketful of okara. (Query your grocer for the whereabouts      of such an outlet. Or, if tofu has not yet arrived at your      neighborhood supermarket, inquire at the local health food      store or co-op.) And since the meal will be free-or, at      <em>most,</em> cost 20c to 25c a pound-remember to provide      the bucket yourself ... it's the least you can do.<br />      <br />      Then again, should all your efforts to locate leftover      okara fail, you can simply break down and make some      yourself (see the accompanying sidebar). It's definitely      worth the effort: One pound of dried legumes, at a cost of      about 30c, will give you a half-gallon of nutritious soy      mash and one gallon of creamy milk.<br />      <br />      <strong>OKARA TREATS</strong><br />      <br />      Depending on where you acquire your okara, the moisture      content will vary: Obviously, hand-squeezed pulp will have      more liquid left in it than will machine-pressed mash. The      recipes below call for the moister, hand-pressed pulp ...      so if you're using a drier batch, you should cook the      treats 5 to 10 minutes less.<br />      <br />      Since these dishes are intended to be nutritious as well as      delicious, all of the recipes call for whole wheat rather      than white flour, barley malt extract (see the Editor's      Note) as well as honey or sugar, and soymilk in place of      cow's milk. If your kitchen isn't stocked with these items,      however, feel free to do some reverse substituting.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>CRUNCHY CAROBOLA</strong></em><br />      <br />      This treat tastes just like a chocolate cereal, but it's      good for you! The recipe makes about a gallon of the      crunchy snack ... which 'is tasty when eaten by the handful      or served with milk as a breakfast food.<br />      <br />      6 cups of okara<br />      1 cup of peanuts<br />      1 cup of sesame seeds<br />      1/2 cup of carob powder<br />      1 cup of raw wheat germ<br />      2/3 cup of vegetable oil<br />      1 cup of honey<br />      1 cup of barley malt extract<br />      3 cups of rolled oats<br />      1 cup of sunflower seeds<br />      1 cup of shredded coconut<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      1 tablespoon of vanilla extract<br />      1 tablespoon of almond extract<br />      <br />      Mix all of the ingredients thoroughly. Spread the mixture      thinly on shallow pans or cookie sheets and bake it at      300'F for 45 minutes, stirring every 10 to 15      minutes.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>APPLE ANARCHY</strong></em><br />      <br />      <br />      These loaves of fruity "upside down" cake are delicious      with coffee or tea.<br />      <br />      4 cups of sliced apples<br />      1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon<br />      1/2 cup of raisins<br />      1/3 cup of whole wheat pastry flour<br />      1/4 cup of honey<br />      1/4 cup of lemon juice<br />      <br />      Combine the ingredients and pat the mixture into the bottom      of two well-oiled bread pans. Then set them aside while you      work on the cake portion.<br />      <br />      3 tablespoons of margarine<br />      1/8 cup of vegetable oil<br />      1/2 cup of barley malt extract<br />      1/2 cup of honey<br />      2 well-beaten eggs<br />      1 cup of soymilk<br />      2 cups of okara<br />      2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour<br />      3 teaspoons of baking soda<br />      1 teaspoon of cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon      of powdered cloves 1/2 teaspoon of powdered ginger<br />      <br />      Cream together the margarine, oil, barley malt extract, and      honey. Then, one at a time, add the eggs, soymilk, and      okara, stirring after each ingredient. Now, in a separate      bowl, sift together the dry ingredients.<br />      <br />      Combine the moist and dry fixings, stirring well. Pour this      over the apple mix and bake the loaves at 350'F until the      center of each loaf springs back when touched lightly      (about 50 minutes).<br />      <br />      <em><strong>SOYBURGER SUPREME</strong></em><br />      <br />      A "tasteful" way to get rid of leftovers, this makes eight      medium burgers.<br />      <br />      2 beaten eggs<br />      1 tablespoon of soy sauce<br />      2 tablespoons of catsup<br />      2 tablespoons of parsley flakes<br />      1 small onion, chopped fine<br />      1 cup of okara<br />      3 tablespoons of nutritional yeast<br />      2 tablespoons of oil or nut butter<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder<br />      1 teaspoon of mustard powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon of black pepper<br />      1 cup of whole wheat flour<br />      1 cup of cooked red beans, rice, oatmeal, potatoes, or      leftover vegetables mashed to add bulk and flavor. (Raid      the refrigerator!) hot sauce to taste<br />      3 tablespoons of sesame seeds Combine all of the      ingredients except the sesame seeds.<br />      <br />      Grease a skillet lightly and heat it until it's medium-hot.      Next, sprinkle the pan with sesame seeds, and drop in      hamburger-sized circles of batter. Sprinkle more sesame      seeds on top. Cover and cook the rounds until they're just      barely solid. Then turn the patties and brown their other      sides. Put the burgers into warm onion buns and smother      them with your favorite condiments.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>RAISIN-SOY COOKIES.</strong></em><br />      <br />      2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour<br />      1/2 teaspoon of salt<br />      3 teaspoons of baking soda<br />      2 teaspoons of cinnamon<br />      1 teaspoon of allspice<br />      1/2 cup of margarine<br />      1-1/2 cups of raw or brown sugar<br />      1/2 cup of barley malt extract<br />      2 well-beaten eggs<br />      3 cups of okara<br />      1 teaspoon of vanilla extract<br />      1 cup of raisins<br />      1/2 cup of sunflower seeds or chopped walnuts<br />      <br />      Sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and      allspice several times. Next, in a different bowl, cream      the margarine, sugar, and malt extract. When this mix is      smooth, blend in the eggs, then add the okara and vanilla      extract. Combine the contents of both bowls and stir the      ingredients well before adding the raisins and sunflower      seeds or nuts. Bake spoonfuls of the mix on greased cookie      sheets at 425'F for 15 minutes. Remove the cookies from the      oven and coot them on brown paper to absorb any excess oil.      This recipe should yield about 6 dozen moist,      half-dollar-sized cookies.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>NO-MEA T SAUSAGE ROLLS</strong></em><br />      <br />      This recipe makes two round loaves of country sausage      that's delicious when fried with eggs or sliced in      sandwiches.<br />      <br />      2 cups of whole wheat flour<br />      3/4 cup of vegetable oil<br />      1 cup of nutritional yeast<br />      1/4 cup of soy sauce<br />      1 small onion, diced fine<br />      1 teaspoon of crushed sage<br />      1/4 cup of molasses<br />      3 teaspoons of parsley flakes<br />      4 cups of okara<br />      1 cup of wheat germ<br />      1 cup of soup stock, whey, or water<br />      1 teaspoon of black pepper<br />      2 teaspoons of sea salt<br />      2 teaspoons of garlic powder<br />      3 teaspoons of crushed thyme<br />      1/2 teaspoon of powdered rosemary<br />      <br />      Combine all of the ingredients, mixing them well, and      squish them into two <em>well-oiled</em> two-pound-sized      coffee cans. Bake them at about 300'F for 1-1/2 hours or      until they're firm. If you like a crusty top (I consider it      the best part), leave the cans uncovered. If you prefer a      completely soft sausage roll, cover the tins with aluminum      foil while they're cooking. Whichever you do, though, be      sure to let the rolls cool completely before removing them      from the cans, so they don't crumble. You also may wish to      vary the oven temperature. Baking the loaves at 2501 to      300'F will result in a very soft sausage that's especially      good when fried for breakfast. Cooking at up to 400'F will      give you a firm sausage ... just the thing for slicing in      sandwiches or using as an appetizer.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>OKARA CORN BREAD</strong></em><br />      <br />      This easy recipe makes two small loaves of moist,      delicately sweetened bread. What's more, the cornmeal and      soy pulp complement each other to form a high-protein      meal.<br />      <br />      2 cups of cornmeal<br />      2 teaspoons of baking soda<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      2 beaten eggs<br />      2 cups of soymilk<br />      3 tablespoons of barley malt extract<br />      1 tablespoon of vegetable oil<br />      3 cups of okara<br />      <br />      In a bowl, stir together the cornmeal, soda, and salt. In      another bowl, blend the eggs, soymilk, barley malt extract,      and oil. When the wet mixture is well blended, add the      okara and pour the wet ingredients over the dry ones ...      stirring 'this batter just enough to moisten      everything.<br />      <br />      Next, spoon or pour the mixture into two well-greased bread      pans and bake the loaves at 425'F for 30 minutes or until      they're firm in the center. Then slather the slices with      butter and honey and serve them warm.<br />      <br />      <strong>ON YOUR OWN!</strong><br />      <br />      Now, it's your turn to experiment! Remember that okara may      be added to almost any yeast or quick bread to provide      fiber, protein, and a subtle, nutty taste. The mash makes a      perfect hamburger or meat loaf extender (even the butchers      are catching on to this one). And, when dried and stored in      a cool, dark place, it will last up to a year and may be      used as is in recipes ... or ground and used like a      (nongluten) flour.<br />      <br />      And when you've stretched your culinary capacities to the      limit and <em>still</em> have an abundance of okara, well      ... there are always your hungry pets and livestock      animals!<br />      <br />      <strong>EDITOR'S NOTE:</strong>Barley malt extract is a      fine sweetener, with more nutrients than honey and none of      its strong flavor. It's more digestible than refined sugar,      corn syrup, or similar liquids, too, and it's relatively      inexpensive (in the author's area, 50c per pound). Check      Your local health food store or co-op for      availability.<br />      <br />      When testing author Prescott's recipes, MOTHER's editor      used Dr. Bronner's Barley Malt Sweetener, a granular      substance many times more powerful than sugar. For those      readers who wish to try this substance, the proportions we      liked were in the vicinity of 1:3-that is, 1 teaspoon      of Dr. Bronners product if the recipe called for 3      teaspoons of malt extract-but the precise. amounts      you choose will naturally depend on individual taste.<br />      <br />      Our thanks to Mr. and Mrs. John Vernon of Blue Ridge      Soyfoods, Fletcher, North Carolina for their generous      contributions of time, information, and fresh okara!    </p>    <h3>MAKE-IT-YOURSELF SOYMILK AND OKARA</h3>    <p>      This recipe makes 1 gallon of soymilk and 112 gallon of      okara.    </p>    <p>      Soak 2-1/2 cups of raw soybeans for 12 hours, changing the      water every 3 or 4 hours in warm weather. Soybeans ferment      quickly, so if a foam develops on the surface of the water,      don't panic ... the legumes are still usable. Just skim the      foam off the top, rinse the beans, and proceed. (The batch      will yield a slightly - thinner milk, that's all.)    </p>    <p>      After 12 hours, strain the beans. Add 1 cup of the soaked      legumes to 2-1/2 cups of fresh warm water in a blender, and      whirl it at high speed for 30 seconds. Continue to puree      the rest of the beans-using the same      proportions-until all of the legumes have been      liquified. Then cook this mash in a heavy covered pot on      medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to      boil.    </p>    <p>      Keep alert: The fast-foaming milk will bubble over the top      of the pan before you know it. Indeed, it should foam up      several times when it first starts boiling. Then turn the      heat down to low and let the liquid simmer slowly for 45      minutes. Stir the slow cooking mash every 5 minutes or so      to prevent it from boiling over. Next, remove the soy slury      from the stove and set the pot in a sink containing cold      water. Keep the water around the pan chilled until the milk      is just warm. (The more quickly soymilk cools, the longer      it will keep.) As soon as the mix reaches a "touchable"      temperature. strain it through a clean cloth. An old cotton      pillowcase ... several layers of food-safe cheesecloth ...      or any other fabric that's dense enough to prevent the mash      from seeping through, but thin enough to allow the milk to      flow, will work fine for this purpose.    </p>    <p>      Close the top of your cloth and begin twist ing it to force      the juice through the bag. When you have little more than a      mushy ball left, squeeze gently so as not to force any pulp      through the fabric.    </p>    <p>      Bottle the strained milk in sterile glass jars, adding a      teaspoon of honey per quart of milk. The sweetener should      melt right into the stillwarm liquid. I've found that milk      remains fresh for approximately a week when it Is kept in      several small containers that are used one at a time. (It      should last over a week when it's stored at temperatures      that are close to freezing.)    </p>    <p>      Now, dump your okara into a small plastic bucket or      wide-mouthed glass jar. The mash also keeps for about a      week in the refrigerator. It's sweetest and best in dessert      dishes the first 3 to 5 days ... after that, it tends to      get a slight tang and tastes better in yeasted breads,      Mexican corn bread, or sausage mixes. If you have any      remaining after a week, mix it with some leftovers and give      your animals a feast ... or compost it. (Heed one word of      warning. Okara is an excellent soil amendment, but, like      any bean product, it ferments strongly. Therefore, don't      leave it sitting around in large lumps I . . unless you      have lost your sense of smell! Break up any clumps and      sprinkle the meal thinly into your garden or compost.)    </p>    <h3>FOR MORE INFORMATION</h3>    <p>      To obtain some more food for thought on this subject, you      might want to consult the following sources:    </p>    <p>      [1] The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook edited by Louise Hagler is      available for $6.00 plus $1.00 shipping and handling from      The Book Publishing Company, Dept.
