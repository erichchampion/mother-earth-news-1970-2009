            		        <p>      <em>As most</em> <em>folks are well aware, an attempt to      achieve a more self-reliant lifestyle-often involves      a good bit of problem solving ... and much of the time      there just doesn't seem to be a ready supply of answers to      the questions that come up. We're pleased to present, then,      the following column . . . in which a number of well-known      individuals front various a areas of expertise (such as      gardening, alternative building methods, hydroponics, water      toxicity, and wood heating, to name a few) have agreed to      act as "consultants " for you.<br /></em><br />      <em>If a question concerning some aspect</em> of      <em>selfreliant living has You stumped, send it to Ask Our      Experts, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>? 105 Stoney Mountain Road,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791.

The most frequently asked      questions will be answered here?and here only?so that we      can all benefit from what these folks have to      say.</em><br />      <br />      We've retired to the North Carolina coast and plan to build      an energy?effilcient home there. We're receptive to just      about any type of structure but do want something that'll      offer significant energy savings in relation to our initial      investment. Is superinsulated housing actually      cost-effective in the climates typical of the      Southeast?<br />      <br />      Definitely. A superinsulated home can be cost-effective on      the cold plains of central Minnesota, in the moderate      mountain climate of western North Carolina, or in the warm      ocean climate of Cape Hatteras . . . essentially because it      can contain-as well as keep out-both cold <em>and</em>      heat, much as does a vacuum bottle.<br />      <br />      Table I briefly summarizes the construction and insulation      differences between a conventional and a superinsulated      house, though the recommended insulation levels would      depend on the regional costs of labor and materials, as      well as on the climate.<br />      <br />      Table 2 shows heating and cooling savings for a typical      superinsulated home (if the design, construction costs, and      materials costs are the same for each example) in the      locations I've mentioned.<br />      <br />      In a nutshell, winter heating needs can be reduced in a      superinsulated structure by more than 80% in Minnesota, and      by 94% to 97% in the North Carolina locations. The same      dwelling designed for the Minnesota climate can cut      air-conditioning needs by <em>60%.-Michael      Scott.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Michael Scott, a superinsulation pioneer who has      provided consulting services for numerous government and      utility organizations, is currently</em> <em>writing a book      on superinsulated construction.</em><br />      <br /></p>			<p>      My family's sole source of heat is one woodburning stove,      and-living in chilly Minnesota?we obviously can't afford to      go without it for long during the dead of winter. My      problem is that creosote accumulates in my chimney at a      rate that demands cleaning <em>at least</em> once a month.      And being forced to let the system cool in January is a      real hardship on my family, as you can imagine! So I'd like      to do everything possible to cut down on the frequency of      those "sweepings".<br />      <br />      The dealer who sold me the stove told in me that if I burn      seasoned hardwood I shouldn't have to clean more than twice      a year. Other people have suggested that it's not so much      <em>what</em> wood one burns but rather <em>how</em> one      burns it ... that is, that it's important to keep the fires      hot enough to consume the creosote in the smoke. Still      others suggest that the problem might be with my chimney.      What I'm wondering is this: Just how much substance is      there to the contention that green or softwood produces      more creosote than does seasoned fuel or hardwood?<br />      <br />      There is some truth in what <em>all</em> your consultants      have told you. Softwoods often produce a little more      creosote than do hardwoods, but not under all      circumstances. However, the effect of wood type is not as      important as chimney type and location, and this-in      turn-isn't as crucial as is how you operate your      stove.<br />      <br />      In our experiments, we've found that -depending on the air      setting on the test stove and the fuel moisture      content?pine (a softwood) resulted in anywhere from the      same amount of creosote as oak to about <em>four</em> times      as much. And, although this is by no means a trivial      difference, it is less significant when compared with the      effect of the heater's air setting itself. We observed up      to 48 times more creosote with a smoldering fire than with      a hot flaming fire using the same fuel.<br />      <br />      Thus, the most important and easiest way to reduce creosote      buildup is to <em>burn</em> the fuel rather than smoke it.      Smaller fuel loads and larger air settings are the key.      This will require more frequent refueling, of course, but      you won't burn significantly more wood to produce the same      amount of heat.-Jay <em>Shelton.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Jay Shelton is the director</em> of <em>Shelton Energy      Research and the author</em> of <em>three books and many      articles on solid fuel heating.

The biggest problem I've encountered is      locating reliable, helpful nutritional information. After      reading different opinions everywhere, I concluded that I      must figure things out for myself. Now, I try to eat only      what makes me <em>feel good.</em><br />      <br />      I'd like to know your views on testing foods for their      nutritional value. Also, could you tell me how the      government tests food for nutritional content, and if it's      possible for <em>individuals</em> to determine such      things?<br />      <br />      We've worked out a satisfying, simple, and health-yielding      diet for ourselves, which we have described at length in      our book Simple <em>Food for the Good Life.</em> Our diet      is based upon our own experience and is not really      scientifically derived, but it <em>works</em> ... for us.      The proof is that we keep well at our advanced ages.<br />      <br />      For "reliable nutritional information" and "government      tests", consult the writings of such experts as Beatrice      Trum Hunter or Frances Moore Lappe. <em>-Helen and Scott      Nearing.</em><br />      <br />      <em>The Nearings began homesteading, in 1932, on a run-down      farm in Vermont</em> ... <em>and then later moved to the      Maine coast, where you can find them today, still building      the stone structures they're famous for and raising      most</em> of <em>their own vegetarian diet.
