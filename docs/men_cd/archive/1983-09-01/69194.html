                    <h5 id="byline">      by Martin J. Colburn    </h5>                <p>      My first "copperhead" knife was born of necessity and      chance-with, perhaps, just a <em>little</em> assistance      from ingenuity-back in 1977. At the time, I was repairing      and replacing cable along a railroad. In order to get to      that heavy wire-which, for the most part, was buried under      crushed stone and cinder-I had to make my way through the      roots, limbs, and thorns of the abundant trackside brush.    </p>            <p>      As you can imagine, the insulation used on the cable had to      be pretty sturdy to survive in that setting ... and I      needed a tool that could strip off the insulation when I      had to make a connection, and that could also cut through      the briars and such surrounding the cable. Furthermore,      since all of the cutting would be done very close to the      wires that I was repairing, a chopping tool was out of the      question. What I needed, it seemed, was a good, sturdy      blade for stripping the cable <em>and</em> a small saw to      clear the way ... and they both had to be able to tolerate      getting jabbed into the gravel every now and again.    </p>        <p>      As it happened, <em>chance</em> stepped in. While I was      walking along the track, I came across a broken power      hacksaw blade ... discarded, no doubt, by a rail repair      crew. Its teeth were in good shape, and the hard steel cut      through saplings and roots easily, without seeming the      worse for the abuse. It did, of course, need a handle. And      I thought--as I headed home that evening with my find      tucked in my back pocket-that if I could also give it a      sharp edge for stripping cable, I'd have both of my "dream      tools" in one.<br />      <br />      I made the knife that same evening. It did the jobs I'd      hoped it would, too. What's more, though my railroad repair      days are over, I still get a lot of use from my copperhead.      I've toted it along on fishing, backpacking, and      prospecting trips and found that-in addition to being      suited for the tool's original uses-the saw edge makes a      -darn good fish scaler, and the hard steel blade is more      than adequate for prying an occasional "promising" rock      from the ground.<br />      <br />      <strong>SHAPING THE BLADE</strong><br />      <br />      In order to make your own copperhead knife, you'll need a      broken or used power hacksaw blade that's <em>at least      10-1/21,</em> long (check with machine shops, railroad      repair gangs, or steel suppliers) ... about <em>2</em> feet      of 3/4" type M soft copper tubing ... about 3 inches of      <em>1/2"</em> type M soft copper tubing ... a 3/4" "sweat      type" copper cap ... some soldering flux and solder (either      50/50 or 60/40) ... a supply of steel wool or emery cloth      ... a few wire coat hangers ... and a little shop time (I'd      figure on about two hours).<br />      <br />      First of all, you'll have to use a portable or bench      grinder to shape the knife. Begin by drawing the grinding      lines on the saw blade with a soapstone or wax pencil,      following the plan in Fig. 1. Do note, too, that I shaped      the blade in such a way that the rake of the sawteeth is      <em>toward</em> the user. Some may take exception to this      feature, but-believe me--I'd rather be pulling away from,      and not pushing <em>into,</em> this tool in the event of a      slip! You can save a considerable amount of grinding time      if you just score along the outline of the blade with the      <em>edge</em> of your grinding wheel, and then      <em>snap</em> <em>off</em> the unwanted sections. (When      shaping the blade, be sure to quench it often in a bucket      of water, to avoid overheating the metal and removing its      temper ... and when grinding, hammering, <em>or</em>      soldering, always wear safety glasses or goggles.)    </p>        <p>      The tang, or inner handle, of the knife must also be      formed. This can be done with some abandon, since it won't      have to hold an edge and thus can be overheated without      suffering too much harm. Once the blade has been shaped-but      not sharpened-set it aside and go on to the next      step.<br />      <br />      <strong>GETTING A GRIP ON IT</strong><br />      <br />      As you may have guessed, the handle assembly (and the      scabbard, which is described later) is responsible for the      knife's being called a copperhead.<br />      <br />      The hand guard (shown in Fig. <em>2)</em> is made by      flattening the small piece of <em>1/2"</em> copper tubing      in a vise. (Hardwood blocks or leather pads can be used, if      necessary, to protect the copper's smooth finish from the      vise's rough grips.) If you're forced to use rigid, rather      than soft, tubing, you'll have to draw the temper out of      it-by heating the material with a propane torch until the      copper turns red, then allowing it to cool      slowly-before using it to make the guard, handle, or      sheath ... this process is called <em>annealing. Now,</em>      mark the 7/8 " tang slot, shown in the drawing, and punch      through that line with a cold chisel. With that done, clamp      the hand guard in a vise, cut it to size, and round the      corners with a file.<br />      <br />      To make the handle itself, you'll first have to "sweat" the      copper cap onto one end of the length of 3/4" tubing.      (Again, if you're working with rigid copper, it'll be      necessary to anneal the material before you attempt to      shape it.) First, thoroughly clean the outside of the tube      and the inside of the cap with emery cloth or steel wool.      Next, apply flux to those surfaces that'll be in contact      when the cap is slipped over the handle. Now, place the cap      on the tube and twist it, to spread the flux evenly. At      this point, you can clamp the tube in your visecap down-and      begin to heat the cap while touching solder to the joint at      a point op <em>posite</em> that being touched by the      torch's flame. The joint between the cap and tubing will      quickly fill with solder. As soon as a bright ring of the      connecting material is showing completely around the joint,      you can stop <em>...</em> and wait until the joint has      cooled before removing any excess solder with sandpaper.      The handle can then be cut to its finished length of 4-1/2      ", cap included (the rest of the 3/4 " tubing will later be      used to make the scabbard). Go on to remove any burrs from      the cut area, and you'll be ready to assemble your      copperhead knife.<br />      <br />      <strong>THREE INTO ONE</strong><br />      <br />      The hand guard will, of course, have to be secured to the      tang before the handle itself can be attached. Start by      putting the blade, tang up, in a vise <em>...</em> being      careful to avoid squeezing the sawteeth, as that would ruin      their "set" and limit their cutting ability. Now, clean and      flux an area extending to an inch or so below the spot      where the blade ends and the tang begins, and slide the      hand guard over the tang until it butts up against the      beginning of the blade.<br />      <br />      You might have to "encourage" the strip of copper while      doing this <em>...</em> if so, use a combination of hammer      and wooden block "buffer" to avoid denting the guard. When      the two pieces fit together to your satisfaction, solder      the hand guard to the tang, but <em>not</em> to the blade.      After removing the joined components from the vise, place      the handle in that tool horizontally, leaving the end of      the cap outside of the jaws. Working slowly, squeeze the      tubing slightly out of round, but only until its inner oval      measures about 7/8" at the widest point. The handle then      can be removed from the vise, and the blade can be      reinserted as it was before. Now, once again using a wooden      block to protect the copper, drive the handle over the tang      until it touches the hand guard. Carefully solder the joint      between these two copper parts, building up a 1/8      "fillet.<br />      <br />      Once the knife has cooled, go on to bend the bottom of the      hand guard a bit back toward the handle, and the top an      equal amount in the direction of the blade. (It's best to      put off sharpening the tool for a while longer if you plan      to make a sheath, as you'll be handling the blade a good      bit during that operation.)<br />      <br />      <strong>WRAP IT UP</strong><br />      <br />      To make an attractive scabbard that won't be ripped to      shreds by your knife's sawteeth, you'll need the rest of      your 3/4 " copper tubing (the remaining section should be      cut to a 16" length) and about eight 10" pieces of coat      hanger wire. Use a wax pencil or similar marker to draw a      line around the tube at a point 7 inches from one end . . .      indicating the portion of the sheath that will actually      cover the blade (the rest will undergo a bit of cutting and      bending, and will serve as a belt loop). Then insert the      hanger wires into the 7" "blade" section of the      scabbard-they'll hang out about 3 inches, of course-and      squeeze the <em>entire 16" length</em> of tubing in the      vise. Work gradually, forming it into an oval first and      then continuing to apply gradual pressure to avoid denting      the material. When you're finished, you'll find that the      lengths of coat hanger have prevented the "blade" section      from flattening completely, leaving room for the knife to      be inserted later.<br />      <br />      Now, cut halfway through the flattened tube on the line      that divides it into two sections <em>...</em> then, as      shown in Fig. 4A, make another cut extending from the top      of that portion of tubing that'll form the belt clip<br />      <br />      and intersecting the first cut (this will, of course,      remove a section of tubing from the front of the scabbard,      leaving a single thickness on the upper part and the      double-thick 7" portion, with an opening for the blade      below). With that done, make two 1/4" lateral cuts, again      as shown in Fig. 4A, where the "blade" and "belt loop"      sections of the sheath meet. Using your vise to hold the      tubing, hammer these two long, 1/4"-wide panels back,      forming a seam along both sides of the belt-clip-to-be.      This adds rigidity to the material and also creates a      smooth, nonsagging edge,<br />      <br />      Your next step will be to trace the curve of the blade      point on the appropriate section of the sheath (mark it on      the front <em>and</em> on the back). Then-and this is      probably the trickiest part of the operation-use your      tinsnips to follow those curves, staying about 1/8" outside      the tracings on what will be the back of the sheath and      about 1/4" beyond the curved line on the front. This will      leave a 1/8" lip on the front of the scabbard, and that can      be peened over as indicated in Fig. 4B.<br />      <br />      You can simply go on to shape the belt loop ... bending,      cleaning, and soldering as indicated in Fig. 4C. Do take      the time to flare out and roll the opening of the scabbard      as shown, too. Insert your still-unfinished knife into the      completed sheath to check it out. You may find that you      have to hammer the scabbard along the edges-or wait until      you've put a real edge on the blade-to get a perfect fit      ... neither too loose nor too tight.<br />      <br />      The knife's cutting surface will, of course, be roughed out      on the grinder. Again, work slowly and cool the steel often      to avoid damaging the temper of the metal, and grind      <em>into</em> the blade rather than away from it, to avoid      turning over a burred edge. When the blade is almost fully      sharpened, finish the task with a good whetstone.<br />      <br />      <strong>DRESS'ER UP</strong><br />      <br />      You can put a beautiful luster on all of the copper parts      of your knife by buffing them on a wire wheel mounted to      your grinder (emery cloth and elbow grease will do the job,      too) ... and a coat or two of clear lacquer or varnish will      <em>preserve</em> that shine. Furthermore, the soft metal      is relatively easy to engrave, using an electric pen made      for that purpose, a scribe, or even a hardened nail. You      can create a facsimile of costly silver inlay by engraving      the copper ... fluxing the grooves ... filling them with      molten solder ... and then, once the solder has cooled,      <em>sanding</em> the bright, silvery material off, leaving      solder only in the grooves of the engraving. (Again, take      the time to <em>protect</em> your handiwork with clear      lacquer.)<br />      <br />      <strong>CONGRATULATIONS!</strong><br />      <br />      That's about it! You've taken a handful of all-but-useless      junk and turned it into a beautiful and practical tool. Now      the copperhead knife is a bit crude when compared with many      of the fine factory- and custommade blades on the market      today, but--given reasonable care-it'll do most anything      its expensive cousins will ... for years to come. And every      time you <em>use</em> the tool you'll be able to savor the      pride and satisfaction of doing a job with an implement      that you made yourself ... and I don't think there's any      way to put a price on that feeling.    </p>
