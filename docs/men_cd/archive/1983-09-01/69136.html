                <p>      <em>Vegetable harvests don't end with the first frost... if      you grow this season-extending crop.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by NancyPierson Farris    </h5>        <p>      Broccoli raab, or rapini, can play an important role in the      home garden. For one thing, it can provide a nutritious      green vegetable during very early spring and very late fall      ... times when few other crops are productive. And for      another, it has a perky, unusual flavor that you just plain      won't get from any other vegetable. (The best I can do to      describe the rapini "culinary experience" is to say that      the leaves taste a bit like turnip greens, while the flavor      of the flower shoots resembles that of mustard greens!)    </p>        <p>      But just what is raab? Well, although this little-known      plant is related to both mustard and turnips (indeed, some      people raise a similar crop simply by letting ordinary      turnip plants mature to the budding stage), Brassica      campestris probably most resembles its cousin broccoli.      Raab produces a central bud within eight weeks after seed      is sown in the garden. When this head is cut, the plant      will send up smaller side shoots with dime-sized tips. You      can harvest these tasty second shoots and, a short while      later, even gather a third cutting!    </p>    <p>      Don't wait until your first pickings are as large as      broccoli heads, however ... or the much smaller buds will      go to flower-and then seed-while you're still hoping for      them to fatten up. Because so many American raab-growing      novices have made precisely that mistake, one seed company      offers the vegetable for sale to "European customers only"      (rapini's often grown in Europe), just to reduce the number      of gardeners who "misraise"-and are likely to      complain about-the plant!    </p>    <h3>      CATCHING COLE    </h3>    <p>      Despite its difference from broccoli, though, raab prefers      the same growing season as does its Brassica relative: It      will tolerate light frosts, but will bolt to seed in hot      weather. Here in South Carolina, I sow my fall crop about      six to eight weeks before the date of the first expected      frost ... and plant my spring crop quite early in the year,      while the soil temperature is still in the mid-40's! (As      the season progresses and the spring-planted raab      deteriorates, I often set tomato plants among the Brassica,      letting the two crops share space for a while, and later      pull the finished raab out and feed it to my livestock.)      Some growers also make late fall sowings-which they      then mulch over during the cold months, especially if their      local winters are typically harsh-for extra-early spring      harvests.    </p>    <p>      To plant, I open a 50-foot furrow and line it with about 25      pounds of rough compost. (Rapini doesn't require heavy      fertilization, but does appreciate a bit of a nutritional      boost. It also prefers soil with a pH above 6.0.) 1 top my      compost with a layer of earth, sprinkle seeds thinly in      this loam, and cover them with a half-inch more of soil.    </p>    <p>      Although some growers crowd their raab by planting on      two-inch centers, I prefer to thin my young sprouts until      they're six inches apart ... so that they can develop a      good quantity of greens. (Pulled seedlings transplant well,      and can be moved to another row if desired.)    </p>    <p>      About six to eight weeks after sowing,, the first heads are      usually ready to pick. Raab buds shatter easily, so I cut      the stems well below their heads ... taking a cluster of      leaves with each. I usually begin harvesting-as early as      possible-at one end of my row. Then I move down the line,      gathering a meal's worth every day or so. By the time I      pick the shoots from the end of my 50-foot row, the plants      I started with will have put out their second growth!    </p>    <p>      To cook rapini, I first strip the leaves from the stem,      examine my pickings for insects, and wash the crop in cold      water. Then I cut the leaves into strips, slice the stems      into serving-sized pieces, and drop everything-buds,      leaves, and stems-into rapidly boiling water. (In my      experience, this hard initial cooking keeps the vegetable      from tasting bitter.) As soon as the leaves are thoroughly      wilted, I lower the heat and simmer the mixture for about      15 minutes. Oftentimes, I'll add a small chunk of ham to      the pan for flavoring. . .. and then join my family in some      good eating!    </p>    <p>      And once you've sampled boiled raab, you'll want to      experiment with other ways of preparing the versatile      Brassica. You can, for instance, cook and serve the greens      alone ... or eat the steamed stalks as mock asparagus.      Third-growth cuttings work particularly well for the latter      purpose, since they tend to have many stalks but tiny      leaves and well-nigh insignificant heads. (Such shoots are      also tasty sliced and stir-fried in a bit of oil that's      seasoned with garlic.)    </p>    <p>      Right now, many growers are watching their gardens slowly      die, as the profusion of mature, and nearly exhausted,      crops starts to decline. Why not put a row of new life into      your plot by sowing some raab?    </p>    <p>      In a few weeks, you'll be glad you did!    </p>    <hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Two sources of broccoli raab seed are Stokes      Seeds Inc., Dept.
