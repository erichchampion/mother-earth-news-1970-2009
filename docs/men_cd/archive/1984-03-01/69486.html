                <p>      <em>True, they can be noisy, ugly, and hot. But they have      their good points, too. So here are . . .</em>    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By Cathy J. Flamholtz</h5>        <p>      <em>If properly maintained, metal roofs don't have to be      eyesores. And you can spot "tin tops" on jut about avery      style and size of building around. For example; [1] painted      steel "shingles" on a beautiful older house, [2] terneplate      on a turn-of-the-century railroad station, [3] a      copper-topped gazebo, [4] aluminum on a smaller home, and      [5] galvanized steel, the "old standards",</em>    </p>    <p>      When my husband and I first moved to the country, I was      amazed at the number of homes in our neck of the Georgia      woods that had metal roofs . . . <em>and</em> at the number      of those tin-topped abodes that displayed "For Sale" signs      out front. So the next time I spoke with a local realtor      friend, I asked him if he found it difficult to market      metalroofed houses. At the question, his face cracked with      a knowing smile.    </p>    <p>      "Anything with a tin roof is going to sell for less . . .      if you can find a buyer for it <em>at all,"</em> he told      me. "Even your typical back-to-the-lander doesn't want to      take one of those buildings on. And most of the people to      whom I <em>do</em> manage to sell metal-topped homes tell      me they plan to replace the roof as soon as they get the      money together."    </p>    <p>      "Well," I said to myself, "if my friend is right, and if my      area is typical, it seems that buying a home topped with      tin might be one way to save a good bit of money . . . and      such a move could make it possible for a would-be ruralite      to settle in the country that much sooner." In short, my      curiosity was whetted, and-since we had some city      friends looking for a bargain-priced house near us-I      decided to learn all I could about metal roofs. I wanted,      above all, to discover why they <em>suffer such</em> a poor      reputation . . . and if they deserve it. It's taken some      time, but what I've learned has really opened my eyes to      the hidden benefits of tin-tops . . . and I'd like to share      some of that knowledge with you here.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TIN AND ITS KIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      First of all, most "tin" roofs aren't made of tin. You see,      there are several metals used for roofing. Below, I've      listed those you're most likely to encounter, along with      some of the strong and weak points of each.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tin:</strong> The more accurate term here is      <em>terne,</em> or even <em>terneplate</em> . . . but no      matter what moniker you hang on the stuff, it's one of      several soft metals treated with a coating of lead and tin.      A tin roof that's properly installed can last a good 40 to      50 years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Galvanized steel:</strong> This is a wonderfully      inexpensive roofing material that will last 60 years or      more . . . if properly cared for. It's made of alloyed      steel, with a protective coating of zinc. Galvanized steel      is also highly rust--resistant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Aluminum:</strong> The use of aluminum as a roofing      metal is becoming increasingly popular, since it resists      corrosion and requires little maintenance. Aluminum also      tends to reflect heat better than steel, thus keeping a      house cooler during the summer. Aluminum roofs will last      about 35 years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Copper:</strong> You won't see copper being used      for roofing much these days, even though it's by far the      longest-lasting of <em>all</em> roofing materials (many      penny-metal lids have lasted hundreds of years and appear      to have hundreds <em>more</em> left in them).      Unfortunately, this material is not only quite expensive,      but also difficult to obtain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROS AND CONS:</strong> <strong>A GENERIC      VIEW</strong>    </p>    <p>      Is a metal roof- <em>any</em> metal roof-worth      considering if you're shopping for a home . . . or if,      perhaps, you're in need of a new top for the old shanty?      It's hard to say-flat out-either yes      <em>or</em> no. But, in hopes of helping you make the      choice that's best for you, I've compiled a list of      tin-roof characteristics . . . both good and bad. First,      let's take a look at the bad news:    </p>    <p>      To provide protection against lightning, you'll need to      spend a few bucks to rig a proper grounding arrangement.      What's more, in seacoast areas where the air is laden with      corrosive salt, a metal roof's life span may be fairly      short. Similarly, polluted air in <em>industrial</em> areas      makes tin topping less enduring than nonmetallic roofing.      And finally, metal roofs are noisy in the rain. (But what      might be an "infernal racket" to one person could be a      "comforting tap, tap, tap" to another.)    </p>    <p>      And now for the <em>good</em> news:<br />      Metal roofs are durable (Monticello-Thomas      <em>Jefferson's Virginia</em> home-still wears its      original "tin" roof . . . and it's in fine shape to this      day). And in areas that receive heavy snowfalls, such      lids-with their slick, low-friction      surfaces-shed the white stuff so quickly that it      rarely has a chance to build up to weighty depths.    </p>    <p>      Most roofing metals are also tough enough to resist damage      from hail and falling tree limbs. Moreover, since metal      doesn't burn, it's especially appropriate for houses with      stovepipes and chimneys . . . a comforting thought when you      live far from the nearest fire station.    </p>    <p>      And to add a final trio of tin-roof routings, the large      metal "shingles" are easy to install, go on quickly,      and-when compared with many other roofing materials      over the long haul-are generally inexpensive.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EVALUATING AN</strong> <strong>EXISTING      ROOF<br /></strong><br />      OK, let's say you decide that buying a house with a metal      roof just <em>might</em> provide you with a shortcut to the      country. You'll still want your new home to be topped with      a <em>healthy</em> slab of sheeting, and you'll need to      know the signs that provide clues to the condition of your      prospective home's "hat".    </p>    <p>      Of course, the logical starting place is to determine the      <em>type</em> of metal the roof is made of, and you can      usually do that with just an exterior appraisal. Steel      roofs-when rusty-have a reddish color. Copper      oxidizes to a light green. Aluminum changes hues according      to the <em>degree</em> of oxidation, but progressing from      white to gray to black.    </p>    <p>      When you've determined the type of material used for the      roof, take a look from a distance to see if there's bulging      or buckling anywhere. If there is, chances are that the      structure has been poorly constructed or that leaks have      rotted some of the bracing or framing. If this is the case,      I'd advise extreme caution . . . you could be talking about      extensive-and <em>expensive</em> -      <em>repairs.</em>    </p>    <p>      Try to find a way to climb up onto the roof for a      bird's-eye view. Since metal roofing is laid on in large      sheets, pay special attention to the seams. Also, look      closely at the ridge and around the chimney (where it      disappears into the roof). These are the places where      you're most likely to spot signs of leaking. Are there a      lot of poppedup nails or an abundance of roofing-tar      patches? Again, these <em>may</em> indicate that the roof      leaks, or has leaked in the past.    </p>    <p>      Check to see if flashings (metal "gaskets" used to direct      water away from critical areas) have been installed where      they should be: around chimneys and stovepipes, along eaves      and hips, and in the valleys. If there's no flashing,      you'll want to correct that problem right away should you      buy the house.    </p>    <p>      Now go <em>inside</em> the building, scamper up into the      attic, and-with a flashlight-peer into the dark      corners. Look everywhere for signs of water damage,      especially around the top of the chimney or stovepipe. And      while you're up there with the dust and spiders, try to spy      out the top plates of the wall studs to determine how sound      they are. If they're badly rotted, it could indicate a      pervasive condition in the hidden stud walls. (If a house      has this problem, I'd forget about trying to make it your      home.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>REPAIRING METAL ROOFS</strong>    </p>    <p>      There's one cardinal rule to remember when doing tin-top      patching: Some metals, if placed in contact with certain      others, can generate an electrolytic reaction that will      result in rapid corrosion. To avoid that nasty possibility,      be sure to patch copper roofs with copper, tin with tin,      and so on.    </p>    <p>      If portions of the roof are badly damaged, you can remove      the injured panels and replace them with new material, but      be careful not to harm the adjoining healthy sheets when      you're pulling the nails. Be sure to use neoprene-gasketed      nails for the new application: They're specifically      designed to prevent leaks. Drive your nails in at the      <em>high points</em> of the corrugation . . . not in the      valleys. (Or, insert neoprene-gasketed "drill screws" with      a power drill to provide a watertight seal.)    </p>    <p>      If there appears to be any leakage through the      <em>existing</em> nail holes, squeeze a dab of silicone      caulking around and under the railheads before you whap      them back down. (Leaking seams may also be caulked.)    </p>    <p>      Soldering is an effective method of mending splits and      holes in a metal roof (except in aluminum). Solder tin and      galvanized steel with <em>rosin</em> flux, and copper with      <em>acid</em> flux. Be sure to heat the metal sufficiently      to avoid getting a weakling <em>cold joint,</em> but use an      iron to prevent temperatures from going too high.    </p>    <p>      If your roof doesn't have flashing in the appropriate      places, you'll need to add it. For aluminum roofs, use      .024" aluminum flashing material. For galvanized steel, use      a matching metal, but in a thickness one gauge heavier than      the roofing itself. Place flashings in the valleys, at the      eaves and hips, and-of <em>special</em>      importance-around chimneys. (Check with your local      building-supply house for ready-made <em>valley sheets</em>      and other flashing materials . . . or-if you have the      necessary tools and skills-you can cut and bend them      yourself.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>LIGHTNING, LIGHTNING,</strong> <strong>GO      AWAY</strong> . . .    </p>    <p>      Too many metal-topped houses aren't properly grounded to      prevent damage from lightning. Grounding will provide a      path for the electrical current of a lightning strike so      that it will bypass the house and enter the earth, where it      can do no harm. If your home is <em>not</em> properly      grounded, the lightning can easily pass through the      structure, perhaps blowing out the electrical system or      causing fire and personal injury.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PAINTING<br /></strong><br />      Painting can spruce up the appearance of an older metal      roof and add years to its useful life. Aluminum roofs don't      need painting, but galvanized steel can benefit      dramatically from a new finish. When you buy roof paint,      don't scrimp on quality . . . unless you want to do the job      again soon. One coat of good paint is usually adequate, but      two is always better. The paint best suited for use on      galvanized steel is a zinc-dust type . . . it'll adhere      well and won't peel. You can also use the less expensive      cement-based and latex coatings, but be certain that those      you choose are formulated specifically for galvanized      steel. <em>Avoid</em> aluminum-based finishes.    </p>    <p>      You can paint with a brush, a roller, or a sprayer, the      first being the most materials-efficient method and the      last being the fastest. But before painting, do remove any      rust with a wire brush (or steel wool, if it's only a small      area), and give the roof a good sweeping. Then scrub it      down with clean water and an old mop. Make sure the      housetop is bone-dry before you start slopping on the first      coat, and pick a warm, sunny day to do the work.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAPPING IT ALL OFF</strong>    </p>    <p>      My intention hasn't been so much to sell you on the virtues      and advantages of "tin" roofs as it has been to supply you      with enough basic information to balance against the bad      press that metal roofing has suffered so often in the past.      Of course, my investigations <em>have</em> made some      lasting impressions on me . . . and when we build a small      guest cabin on our property soon, it'll most certainly be      dressed out in a shiny new galvanized cap!    </p>
