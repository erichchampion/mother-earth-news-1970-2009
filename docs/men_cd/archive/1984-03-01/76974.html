                <p>      <strong>DOWN-HOME</strong>    </p>        <p>      With spring just around the bend, it won't be long before      we will again be playing host to lots of uninvited insect      guests. And, among these, wasps can be especially      troublesome . . . or downright nasty! So let's look at a      triad of suggestions offered by (and for) MOTHER's readers.    </p>    <p>      The first tip comes from Robert Grinarml of Cambridge      Springs, Pennsylvania. Bob says that folks whose nearby      neighbors would not be disturbed by the sound of a shotgun      blast can literally "blow" wasp nests out of hard-to-reach      places (like secondstory eaves) . . . and do it from a      wasp-safe distance. Bob says, "Cut about an eighth of an      inch off the top of a shotgun shell and dump out the      pellets. Now, just load up your trusty scattergun with the      de-shotted shell and blast the offending nest. The wadding      (the paper or plastic material that separates the shot from      the powder) will knock the nest down without doing any      damage to your house."    </p>    <p>      But Mr. Grinarml goes on to caution, "A hasty retreat may      be in order, though, if you score a direct hit on an      occupied nest!"    </p>    <p>      Nongunners might be interested in the method Dave Kooyers      of Boonville, California uses to rid his outbuildings of      hornets. "I bought a five-pound bag of `burning' sulfur at      the local farm supply store," Dave reports, "and carted it      home. When hornets set up in my sheds, I crumple some paper      into the bottom of an empty coffee can and dump about half      a cup of sulfur on top of the paper. Next, I place the can      in an old skillet and set the frypan on the floor of the      hornet-infested building. After making sure that nothing      burnable is nearby, I light the paper, close the door, and      stay away from the building for a day or more (humans can't      stand the noxious sulfur fumes any more than hornets can!).    </p>    <p>      "The smoke fumes will drive out <em>all</em> bugs and keep      them away long after the odor has disappeared."    </p>    <p>      A third <em>Hymenoptera</em> -fighting strategy was      submitted by Ross Westergaard of Surrey, British Columbia.      Our Canadian friend writes, "The town houses in our      neighborhood are flat-roofed, with only a two-foot crawl      space for an attic. Wasps gained access to one of these      spaces through a small hole, and pretty soon over 200 of      them had set up housekeeping! Now I'm usually one to live      and let live, but these flying critters weren't about to      hold up <em>their</em> end of that bargain. In fact, they      got so pugnacious that it was dangerous to step outside the      front door or open the upstairs windows.    </p>    <p>      "Liquid sprays were out of the question, since they could      soak through the ceiling. Gas would have necessitated      evacuating both our <em>and</em> the neighbors' houses for      at least a day . . . and would have been too expensive.    </p>    <p>      "Well, we got four coils of old-fashioned flypaper and      pinned them to the eaves near the wasps' entrance hole (we      used a long pole to put the strips in place). The sticky      stuff was up for no more than a few minutes before it      started collecting wasps. Within three days, over a hundred      of the pesky insects were stuck. And by the end of a week,      they were <em>all</em> gone."    </p>    <p>      Darlene Wagner of Grants Pass, Oregon has some tips for      handling newborn bunnies. Darlene, who has raised rabbits      for 15 years, says, "One of the most critical things to do      to assure the health of a new litter of bunnies is to check      the nest box soon after the kindling in order to remove any      dead babies, afterbirth, or blood. However, if a litter is      touched during the first few days by human hands, too often      the doe either will refuse to reenter the nest box      or-worse yet-will kill the entire litter.    </p>    <p>      "But I learned a trick to avoid this (from my 90-year-old      rabbit-raising friend): Just sprinkle talcum or baby powder      on your hands and rub a little of it on the doe's tummy.      Now you can safely handle the newborn as much as necessary      to clean out the nest box without the slightest worry that      the doe will neglect or destroy her young."    </p>    <p>      "I've lived two years in my 18' tipi here in the Colorado      Rockies at 7,000 feet," writes Paul Moore of LaPlata      County, Colorado, "and the only problems I've run up      against have had to do with a shortage of indoor living      space and the lack of electricity for refrigeration of      food. After some meditation, I helped solve both problems      by digging a rectangular pit in the ground inside my tipi,      lining it with thick, aluminumbacked insulation panels,      then lowering in my big chest-type ice cooler. Now, the      cooler is out of the way, giving me additional room to move      . . . and all I have to do to use it is to throw back the      braided rug that covers the floor of my tipi, lift up the      piece of plywood that's over the pit, and remove the lid of      the ice chest. As a bonus, the insulation and subfloor      location triple the time it takes for a block of ice to      melt."    </p>    <p>      Have the backs of your car's or truck's bucket seats got      those frazzled, worn-out blues? If so, Shane Jones of      Oklahoma City has a quick, inexpensive remedy. "When the      backs of my Toyota's bucket seats started to wear, I just      stretched a couple of old T-shirts over them (with the tops      of the seat backs protruding through the neck holes) to      make my own unique upholstery . . . and to save dropping      more than a few pennies at the local tuck-and-roll shop. At      first, the neighbors snickered when they saw them, but I've      noticed lately that many of <em>their</em> car seats are      starting to dress in Tshirts, too!"    </p>    <p>      Elizabeth England of Slocum, Rhode Island has come up with      an herbal dandruff cure that she'd like to share with the      rest of us. To brew her cure, Elizabeth mixes 1 gallon of      boiling water with 2 ounces of chamomile and a 2inch ginger      root, coarsely grated. Next, she lets the blend stand until      cool, then pours it into smaller bottles. Elizabeth reports      that her herbal cure cleared up a bad case of the white      flakies in just three days . . . and offers the bonus of      being an excellent hair detangler.    </p>    <p>      "Next time you clean your hairbrush," writes Mary Leck of      Washington, Kansas, "don't throw the hair away. Instead, do      what the pioneers did: Save it for a natural pincushion.      Sounds dirty? Well, it's not, and the natural oils on the      hair will keep your pins and needles rust-free and sharp.      To make the cushion, just cut out a rectangular piece of      closely woven cotton material . . . double the size you      want your finished product to be. Then fold the rectangle      in half and stitch up the two sides so you have a miniature      `pillowcase'. Now, sew up the end, leaving a small opening      at one side. Turn the cloth pouch inside out, and put hair      from your comb in through the opening. I just pin the      opening shut between `stuffings', then sew it closed when      the cushion is full.    </p>    <p>      "It's amazing, but I've actually found that diaper pins can      be sharpened just by running them through this kind of a      hair-filled pincushion a few times."    </p>    <p>      <em>Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, downhome, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday life.
