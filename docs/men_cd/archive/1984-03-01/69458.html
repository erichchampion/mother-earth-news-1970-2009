            <p>      Issue # 86-March/April 1984    </p>        		<h5 id="byline">By Ken Haedrich</h5>        <p>      If you can gather up some lip-smackin'-good recipes and      write them down in clear, understandable language -      and if you're willing to invest some time and money to make      <em>more</em> money-then chances are you can      successfully publish your own cookbook. Believe me, I know:      I've sold thousands of copies of my self-produced menu      manual, <em>Good</em> <em>Foodl</em> <em>Good</em>      <em>Folks.</em> And I started with little more than a      notion to earn (somehow) my own living my own way.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A MARKETABLE IDEA</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Even though I enjoy writing about meatless cooking, I never      would have published my compendium without reasonable      confidence that it would sell. But upon considering the      high (and rising!) cost of meat, I thought it likely that      there'd be a whole passel of budget-conscious folks out      there willing to pay a measly $2.50 each for a fresh batch      of vegetables-only recipes. And I figured that many      prospective buyers could be reached rather easily through      local retailers . . . <em>and</em> by advertising in      magazines that have vegetarian followings.    </p>    <p>      In other words, once you've come up with what <em>you      think</em> is a good idea for a cookbook (it could be      anything from <em>Banana Bakery</em> to <em>101 Ways to      Cook With Yogurt),</em> try your best to objectively weigh      that concept's <em>marketability.</em> Ask your friends      what they think of the idea. And if you can, get the      opinions of people in the business: I never pass up an      opportunity to discuss a prospective title with bookstore      owners and managers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RECIPES</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      I scrounged the material for my cookbook from a variety of      sources: my family . . . friends . . . and a good many      MOTHER-readers, who very kindly sent me their favorite      recipes in response to a Dear MOTHER letter from me that      appeared in issue 51. Then I chose what seemed to be the      most mouth-watering (and easiest-to-make)      dishes-breads, soups, main dishes, and      desserts-and prepared each one, in order to test the      directions for clarity and accuracy. Once the "receipts"      had been given the Haedrich stamp of approval, I set about      <em>carefully</em> typing them. A neatly prepared      manuscript is worth its weight in gold . . . it'll save you      money, avoid delays, and help prevent typographical errors.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TYPESETTING</strong> <strong>(AND      ALTERNATIVES)</strong>    </p>    <p>      Having your copy typeset has advantages: It can be done      quickly, and the text looks attractive and thus helps to      sell books. But unless you're lucky enough to have      unlimited funds or a relative in the business, you'll      probably want to use a less expensive technique (it never      hurts to check around, though . . . you might find a small      outfit willing to offer you a bargain price).    </p>    <p>      One option is to type each page on an ordinary typewriter      or-better yet-an IBM Executive or Selectric. But      perhaps the best of all possible shoestring techniques is      handlettering . . . if, that is, you can provide the      required artistic flair and patient attention to detail. I      can think of several best-selling cook-books that are      attractively hand-lettered (and, in fact, probably are      popular largely <em>because</em> of their rustic format).    </p>    <p>      <strong>GRAPHICS</strong>    </p>    <p>      For visual interest, you'll want to pepper your pamphlet      with plenty of illustrations (but not photos . . . even      black-and-white Pictures add substantial expense, and color      ones can <em>double</em> the total printing cost). If      you're like me and have no more artistic talent than a      walrus, enlist the aid of a friend or relative who can draw      reasonably well. In typical MOTHER fashion, I bartered some      yard work for the drawings in <em>Good FoodlGood      Folks,</em> and although they may not be the fanciest of      renderings, they do impart a perfect "homey" feel to my      little volume.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LAYOUT AND PASTEUP</strong>    </p>    <p>      You'll save as much as a couple of hundred dollars if you      do your own layout and pasteup. The only special supplies      you'll need are rubber cement (and rubber cement "pickup"      for removing smears). . . "LinUp" sheets or a similar brand      of gridded pasteup board (one for each page of your book) .      . . and several light blue nonphotographic pencils.    </p>    <p>      To lay each page out, draw the page size of your book on a      "LinUp" sheet (using a blue pencil). Then position whatever      illustrations and text you want on that page . . . outline      the areas with your pencil . . . brush a coat of rubber      cement on the back of the drawings and copy . . . and glue      each element into place (taking care, of course, to align      everything properly).    </p>    <p>      For a really thorough discussion of this      procedure-and of printing in general-I highly      recommend <em>Printing It</em> by Clifford Burke (available      for $4.95 plus 50 cents shipping and handling from Wingbow      Press, Dept. TMEN, 2929 Fifth Street, Berkeley, California      94710).    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINDING A PRINTER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before choosing a printer, talk to talks who've previously      done business with such firms in your locale. Then get in      touch with the companies that seem to give the best service      and ask each of them for a written price quote for printing      your book. You'll need to provide them with some basic      information: the number of pages (and photos, if any), the      size of the book, the kind of paper and cover stock, and      the type of binding you desire.    </p>    <p>      The cost of paper will constitute a good portion of your      total production expense, so shop around. <em>Good      FoodlGood Folks is</em> printed on 60-pound cream-colored      stock that I got at a discount because I picked it up from      the paper supplier myself and paid for it in cash. Printers      have hundreds of paper samples on hand to show you and      often can offer you "mill specials" (certain stocks that      wholesalers are pushing at a discount price).    </p>    <p>      Of the several kinds of bindings available, I prefer saddle      stitching (stapling along the fold): It's a neat,      economical way to hold a cookbook together, and this      arrangement allows the volume to lie flat when opened.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SELL, SELL, SELL!</strong>    </p>    <p>      OK. Your cookbook has been bound and delivered . . . you've      celebrated with a bottle of wine . . and sold ten copies to      your friends. Now, it's time to learn the First Commandment      of the self-publisher: "Thou shalt get out there and sell      thy pants off!"    </p>    <p>      Naturally, you'll want to hit all the local gift shops and      bookstores right away. (Unless you're a personal friend, a      retailer will expect a standard 40% discount . . . along      with a promise that you'll buy back any unsold copies after      six months.)    </p>    <p>      Direct sales are the most profitable, of course, since you      eliminate your middleman's "take". If you send review      copies of your book to the food editors at nearby radio      stations and newspapers, you'll often get free (and      productive) publicity. And try to arrange for all the      garden club-type speaking engagements you can. On one      such occasion, I spoke for 20 minutes or so, whipped up      some recipes, and afterward sold 50 books!    </p>    <p>      <strong>COSTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The amount of money you pay to produce your book will      depend upon the resources you have (available money,      friends or relatives who can provide cut-rate printing or      typesetting, and so on) . . . and upon your own ingenuity      (bartering for various services can go a long way toward      keeping costs low).    </p>    <p>      Try to come up with a fairly accurate estimate of what the      total cost will be <em>before</em> you actually start      investing time and money in your project. You'll need to      establish a tentative price for the book, too. The best way      to do so is to comparison shop at local bookstores to see      what similar publications are selling for.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that second and successive printings will      cost far less, since typesetting, negative, and plate fees      have already been met. Your per-book cost, therefore, will      plummet . . . leaving you with a far larger profit margin!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Good Food/Good Folks is      <em>available for $2.50 postpaid from Ken Haedrich,      American Impressions, Dept.
