        <p>Fieldbook <em>Conventional publishing wisdom claims that it's a mistake to run poetry in a "consumer" magazine. However, although that may often be true, we're convinced that MOTHER's readers are the kind of people who look for beauty in the practical and search out practicality in the beautiful . . . and who realize that good poetry can be useful as well as inspiring. In fact, the best of poems can help us. recognize the wonderful-and often well-hidden - similarities that all humans share . . . and by doing so, can make each of us feel a little bit less alone. The poetry included in this occasional feature-be it brand-new or previously published written by a recognized poet or a first-timer-will be material that, in the eyes of MOTHER's editors, helps us see ourselves in the words of others. It's that quality, and the fact that the work presented here will reflect the range of subject areas usually presented in this magazine, that gave this feature its name.</em></p><p><strong>Deer Among Cattle</strong></p><p>Here and there in the searing beam<br />Of my hand going through the night meadow<br />They all are grazing<br /><br />With pins of human light in their eyes.<br />A wild one also is eating<br />The human grass,<br /><br />Slender, graceful, domesticated<br />By darkness, among the bred<br />for slaughter,<br /><br />Having bounded their paralyzed fence<br />And inclined his branched forehead onto<br />Their green frosted table,<br /><br />The only live thing in this flashlight<br />Who can leave whenever he wishes,<br />Turn grass into forest,<br /><br />Foreclose inhuman brightness from his eyes<br />But stands here still, unperturbed,<br />In their wide-open country,<br /><br />The sparks from my hand in his pupils<br />Unmatched anywhere among cattle,<br /><br />Grazing with them the night of the hamme<br />r As one of their own who shall rise.<br /><br />-James Dickey Excerpted from James <em>Dickey: Poems</em> 1957-1967.
