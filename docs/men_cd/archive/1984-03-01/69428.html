        <p>Few flavors can compete with the succulent sweetness of a fresh strawberry. Then again, few fruits are as backbreakingly difficult to harvest as these low-tothe-ground red edibles. However, berry lovers, take heart: I've designed a contraption that should ease many of the aches and pains so familiar to strawberry harvesters.</p><p>I came upon the design idea for this device by accident when, about a year ago, some friends of mine in Oregon asked me to help them find a way to speed up their strawberry harvest.</p><p>Dedicated inventor (and friend) that I am, I couldn't let them down, so I took to the drawing board right away. Even though I tried everything I could think of, nothing looked promising. I was almost ready to give up until, while visiting a farm sale, I spotted an old-fashioned one-legged milking stool with a waist strap. Could the perfect solution to my friends' picking woes, I asked myself, <em>already</em> have been invented? In any case, I bought the strap-on seat and gave it to my friends to let them answer that question for themselves.</p><p>Several months later, I visited Oregon during the picking season to see how things were going. Well, the word had gone out that "the inventor" was on the scene, and I was treated like a visiting monarch. As it turned out, that crazy milking stool had worked so well that it had been irreparably broken from overuse.</p><p>Now vintage milking seats are mighty hard to come by these days, but-as I said-I'm an inventor. It took me little time to come up with the design for a simulated one-legged milking stool. So, if you're a strawberry grower on a small <em>or</em> large scale (or if you're simply a home gardener with lots of low-down chores to do), you might just profit from my easy-to-follow plans for the Strawberry Picker's Delight.</p>
