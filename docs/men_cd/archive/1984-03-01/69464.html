                <p>      <em>If you're planning new construction, you may well want      to incorporate this low-cost way to . . .</em>    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By Jerri Broeffle</h5>    <p>      Although it's true that some parts of the country, such as      California, are more prone to earthquakes than are others,      it's also true that virtually no place in the United States      is entirely safe from the threat of quake damage. All or      parts of 39 of our states lie in zones classified by      scientists as being at risk from seismic shocks of      <em>moderate</em> (magnitudes of 6 to 7 on the Richter      scale) or <em>major</em> (magnitudes greater than 7)      strength. Thus, more than 70 million people in this country      are exposed to <em>significant</em> quake-related hazards.      And no state is completely free from the possibility of at      least "minor" damage from these natural upheavals.    </p>    <p>      In our part of western Washington, in fact, ground tremors      are fairly common . . . and the potential for a substantial      quake is very real. So when I built a 24' X 40' barn and      two 25' X 28' workshops about ten years ago, I incorporated      a relatively inexpensive and very simple building technique      that has since protected those structures through more than      a decade of recurrent ground tremors ... <em>including</em>      the considerable shaking we experienced when Mount St.      Helens-just 90 miles away as the crow      flies-erupted in 1980.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SHAKE, RATTLE...</strong> <strong>AND      BREAK</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although earthquakes can produce more than one kind of      shock wave (some travel vertically, some horizontally, and      others in circular patterns), it is <em>horizontal      acceleration</em> (the side-to-side movement of the earth)      that causes the greatest amount of severe damage. The      concrete foundation of a building tends to move with these      vibrations during a tremor, and if the above-ground portion      of the structure is not firmly secured to the base, the      framework can break away . . . resulting, of course, in      partial-or total-collapse.    </p>    <p>      According to the Uniform Building Code (UBC), which has      been adopted widely by inspection authorities throughout      the country as a standard for all new construction,      wood-frame structures with concrete or reinforced masonry      foundations must be affixed to their bases by a specific      method: First, anchor bolts of <em>at least</em> 1/2" in      diameter (most builders use hardware that's 5/8" in      diameter by 10" long) are embedded vertically 7" or more      into the foundation-all along the perimeter, at      intervals of no more than 6'-with a portion of each      bolt projecting above the mortar or concrete. Then the      building's sill plates (the bottommost, horizontal wooden      members of a frame structure) are drilled so they'll slip      down over the protruding anchor bolts, and once the plates      are set in place-flush against the      foundation-nuts are tightened down onto the wood.    </p>    <p>      This method of anchoring sill plates does keep the boards      attached to the foundation during an earthquake, but it      fails to help the structure as a whole absorb and withstand      the forces of seismic shock. However, my technique-a      simple variation of the standard procedure-allows a      building to move <em>with</em> its foundation during the      course of a quake, and also provides a bit of flexibility      and cushioning between the base and the sill . . . thus      offsetting at least some of an upheaval's shearing effect.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LOW-COST, LOW-TECH</strong> <strong>QUAKE      "INSURANCE"</strong>    </p>    <p>      The only additional building materials required for my      anti-quake construction technique are [1] oversize washers      (in other words, washers with center holes matching the      diameter of your anchor bolts and relatively large      <em>outside</em> diameters such as 1-1/4" or 1-1/2") and      [2] self-sealing weatherstripping at least 1-1/2" wide.      You'll need as many washers as there are anchor bolts in      the foundation, and an amount of weatherstripping equal to      the total length of the building's sill plates.    </p>    <p>      Now, when drilling holes in your sill plates to enable you      to slip the boards down onto the anchor bolts, bore the      cavities <em>1/8"</em> <em>larger</em> in diameter than the      bolts themselves. (Thus, if you're using 5/8" anchors,      you'll drill 3/4" holes.) But before actually installing      the sills, place the weatherstripping directly on top of      the foundation, between the anchor bolts, where the boards      will lie. Then carefully position the predrilled sills over      the anchor bolts and press the plates down firmly onto the      cushioning material.    </p>    <p>      Finally, drop an oversize washer over each anchor bolt and      tighten a nut firmly down onto the disk. The washer should      actually bite into-in other words, make a depression      in-the wooden sill. In some regions, the local      building codes may require placement of a <em>termite      barrier</em> - <em>a strip</em> of aluminum or      galvanized steel-between the foundation and sill. If      that's the case in your locality and you're following my      technique, simply install the barrier first, place the      weatherstripping on top of the metal, and then fasten down      the plates.    </p>    <p>      Drilling the sill-plate hole 1/8" larger than the anchor      bolt's diameter provides a minute amount of side-to-side      "give" that reduces the brittleness of the conventional      sill-to-foundation attachment and thus helps to prevent      shearing. In addition, the weatherstripping acts as a      cushion between the base and framework, making the whole      assembly somewhat more flexible and able to absorb ground      shocks (by the way, the self-sealing material also provides      a watertight seat between the foundation and the sill).    </p>    <p>      Of course, much of the beauty of this method is its      extraordinarily low cost. When quake-proofing a typical 24'      X 40' building, for example, you might use as many as 40      anchor bolts, and the total length of the sill plates would      be 128'. In my part of the country, 5/8" X 1-1/2" washers      cost 304 apiece, and 1-1/2" weather-stripping runs 20      <em> cents</em> a foot. You'd pay $12.00 for the 40      washers, therefore, and $25.60 for the cushioning . . . for      a total cost of $37.60. That's a mighty small investment      compared with the repair (or rebuilding) expenses that it      could help you avoid!    </p>    <p>      <strong>SAFETY <em>IS</em> RELATIVE, THOUGH</strong>    </p>    <p>      My local building inspectors have approved this technique      as an effective way to minimize the potentially destructive      forces of seismic shock (be sure to get a similar OK from      your local officials, though, before you incorporate my      method into your own construction). I certainly don't      claim, however, that it's a <em>guarantee</em> against      damage from an earthquake. In fact, there's probably      <em>no</em> real protection from the forces of a truly      substantial quake (the energy released by the 1964 Alaska      earthquake, for instance, was estimated to equal the power      of 12,000 Hiroshima-type nuclear bombs!). But at least      there's <em>something you</em> can do-for relatively      little money-to give your home and outbuildings a      better chance of surviving tremors or a quake of minor, or      perhaps even moderate, magnitude. And that extra measure of      protection, I think, is well worth the little additional      expense and effort!.    </p>
