                    <p>      <strong>PAST DUE</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>"The key to comprehending the bill-collecting game      is to realize that there are<br /> very few 'nice guys' on the      card."</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINAL NOTICE</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Financial worries have a way of becoming complicated      problems, so it helps to be informed.</em>    </p>    <p>      The advent of credit cards and easy terms for buying seems      to have opened a Pandora's box of woes for many American      households. When you consider how simple it is to buy on      time (and how, in fact, we're coaxed or cajoled into doing      just that), it's little wonder that some folks get      themselves into financial straits that aren't all that easy      to get out of. And as most of us probably already know from      harsh experience, it only takes one unexpected blow      (perhaps a layoff, a sickness, or an accident) to turn a      strained budget into a <em>broken</em> one.    </p>    <p>      It's at this point, though, that the <em>real</em> problems      begin . . . because if a creditor doesn't receive payment      within the normal 30-day billing cycle, for the next 30,      60, 90 days (or more) he or she will continue to request      remittance . . . while handily tacking on a stif finance      charge, to boot! Then-as if that weren't      enough-should the account remain outstanding, there's      a mighty good chance it'll be turned over to a collection      agency that, as you can well imagine, will handle the      matter in an entirely different fashion than would your      friendly local retailer.    </p>    <p>     <strong>FOR SOME, IT PAYS TO PESTER</strong>    </p>    <p>      A collection agency, you see, is usually the creditor's      last resort. Look at it from the "opposition" 's      perspective: Since the bill will most likely become a total      write-off if the matter isn't pursued, a creditor figures      it's worth giving up the standard 15-50% off-the-top fee to      an agency in order to secure even a portion of the debt      owed.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the methods by which many bill-collecting      firms go about their business are something less than      commendable, especially in light of the fact that the great      majority of people in debt would <em>gladly</em> make good      on their financial commitments if they were solvent.    </p>    <p>      In essence, collectors rely upon the average person's      ignorance of [ 1] the law, [2] the credit-rating game, and      [3] his or her rights and recourses. The agencies then      compound that with intimidation, scare tactics, and guilt      trips ... and come up with a working formula that's      appallingly effective, particularly with those whose lives      have already been disrupted by financial (and, doubtless,      <em>family)</em> worries.    </p>    <p>      But it doesn't have to be that way! Once an honest debtor      understands what a collection agency can and      <em>cannot</em> do, it's relatively simple for him or her      to deal intelligently with those fiscal ferrets . . . and      to turn the tables on them and their tactics if that's what      it takes to encourage them to look elsewhere for an easier      target.    </p>    <p>       <strong>EMPTY BARRELS MAKE THE LOUDEST NOISE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Understandably, it'd be nearly impossible to present every      conceivable type of consumer debt situation and then offer      a watertight solution in the space we have here. But we      <em>can</em> spotlight some of the more common      circumstances and-by removing the shroud of mystery      that often seems to surround them-help the      financially strapped individual to determine the best      course of defensive action.<br />      <br />      The key to comprehending the bill-collecting game is to      realize that there are very few "nice guys" on the card.      Remember that such individuals are making a business out of      raking money off a transaction that really has nothing to      do with <em>them . . .</em> and that the more they can      squeeze from each person (and the more people they can      harass successfully), the fatter the bill collectors'      paychecks are going to be at the end of the month.    </p>    <p>      Bearing these facts in mind, it's not too difficult to see      why the collection agents go to such lengths to extract      payment. Admittedly, the days of "strong arm" physical      persuasion are all but over, yet the current "mind game"      tactics are almost as ruthless . . . and can be extremely      effective.    </p>    <p>      For example, a collection agency's representative might      have the audacity to inform the tardy bill payer (in a      convincingly authoritative manner) that failure to pay up      will lead to arrest or jail. Ridiculous! Debtors' prison      was abolished long ago, and financial insolvency is      certainly no crime. (Exceptions to this are cases of child      support or alimony delinquencies, which are entirely      different matters.)    </p>    <p>      More frequently, though, the budgetary buzzards dangle the      "ruined credit rating" menace over their victim, warning      that they'll report the derelict account history to the      credit bureau and thus destroy the nonpayer's invaluable      credit standing nationwide. But upon scrutiny, this threat      just doesn't hold water. First of alt, an account that's      three or four months overdue probably has already been      disclosed to a local or national credit-reporting agency.      Then again, let's be frank: The last thing a person with      financial difficulties needs is extended credit! Painful as      it may seem initially, relinquishing charge privileges      "cold turkey" makes it a lot easier to deal with existing      fiscal commitments. (And, as many folks thrown into this      situation discover, credit is only a convenient luxury, not      an absolute necessity.)    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>BEING SMART BY PLAYING DUMB</strong>    </p>    <p>      But what if the credit threats aren't immediately      effective, perhaps because there simply isn't enough cash      flow to support both a family <em>and</em> the creditors?      Well, the collection agency isn't likely to give up without      a fight, no matter what the personal circumstances of the      debtor, so the bloodsucking scheme proceeds.    </p>    <p>      After sending the initial dunning notices and following      them up with the previously mentioned threats, the agency      may get really nasty and start calling its mark at home,      work, or any other place at which an agent can make contact      to continue the harassment. Collection personnel may try      intimidation by assigning themselves importantsounding      titles or by suggesting that they're associated with some      government agency. All this is intended to frighten the      victim into paying the account <em>pronto,</em> regardless      of any other commitments that may exist.    </p>    <p>      But none of these tactics has any effect if the bill      collectors aren't certain they're dealing with the right      person. If-as is likely-the only information      they have is a name, address, and perhaps a telephone      number, they'll rely on the old "try the shoe on and see if      it fits" routine to establish that thev have indeed struck      a responsive chord in their intended target.    </p>    <p>      The solution to that situation is so obvious that it almost      has no right to be effective: Just don't give the      collection agency any information whatsoever! That's right!      When its representatives call, they'll probably ask      innocent-sounding questions like "Is this Norton Bryant      Blue?" or "Do you still reside at 1075 Oak Street?" . . .      and by answering such easy queries, the victim not only      admits that the collection hound's facts are correct but      runs the risk of being led down the garden path to answer      <em>more</em> <em>damaging</em> questions that will      inevitably follow.    </p>    <p>      The best procedure, then, is to answer a question with a      question. Instead of replying "Yes, this is Mr. Blue", the      informed target would better say "Who's calling?" . "What's      this call in reference to?" . . . "Could you please tell me      what you wish to speak to Mr. Blue about?" . . . "We don't      answer questions over the telephone" . . . or "This is just      an answering service". In short, since the bill collector      will try to get as much as possible out of the person at      the other end of the line (current address, place of      employment, bank account information), it's imperative that      the caller be offered nothing, either by the target or by a      member of the target's household.    </p>    <p>      The same advice, of course, applies to written requests for      money or information. If' there's just <em>no</em> money to      put toward an owed account, it's best simply to ignore such      letters. (Problems that concern appropriating a limited      amount of money for partial payment of delinquent bills      will be covered a little further on.)    </p>    <p>      Think about it. Often a collection agency will invite the      debtor's comments or explanations . . . in writing. By      complying, the subject of the search automatically admits      guilt, and sending along a small personal check to keep the      hounds quiet is an open invitation for action leading to a      possible court-ordered lien against a checking or savings      account (since the correct name, address, bank account,      and/or driver's license number are all being unwittingly      provided).    </p>    <p>     <strong>KEEPING THE WOLF FROM THE DOOR</strong>    </p>    <p>      In some cases, the toal of the owed bills may far supass      wath an individual can comfortably afford to pay on his or      her salary, but at least there's something coming in. Under      such circumstances (assuming that the person in debt wants      to make good and is still receiving only past-due notices      indicating that the account hasn't yet beer turned over to      a collection agency), throwing the creditors a bone can      help to stay further vexation.    </p>    <p>      The process works like this: The financially strapped      person first separates secured debts from unsecured ones.      The difference between them is that the former is a signed      agreement stating that the purchase-or a piece of      collateral-can be forfeited if scheduled payment      isn't made, whereas the latter is simply a debt that's been      incurred without collateral (such as a professional's fee      or a credit card balance).    </p>    <p>      Naturally, since the secured debts are more pressing, the      payer first decides how much he or she can afford to part      with on a monthly basis and then divides the number of      outstanding secured debt bills into that figure . . . to      come up with how much each creditor will receive, <em>no      matter what the amount due on each account.</em> The      creditors know, you see, that the longer any given account      remains outstanding, the slimmer are their chances of      getting paid. Therefore, even though they may argue for      half or even full payment, they'll probably settle for a      fraction of the total each month.    </p>    <p>      The unsecured debts aren't as urgent but should still be      paid. To figure out how to handle such reparations, the      debtor should follow the action outlined above-on a      smaller scale-after examining family and household      needs to see how much would be left over, in a pinch, to      feed the <em>unsecured</em> debts.    </p>    <p>      Then, after having "made the rules", so to speak, all the      bill payer does is type a letter to each creditor,      <em>telling</em> -not asking-what amount will      be paid and on what terms. (When dealing with creditors by      mail, the bill payer can't be fast-talked into making an      unwise commitment . . . besides, the Postal Service takes      longer than a telephone company does to relay a message.)      Creditors, by and large, usually go for such an offer,      knowing it's less expensive for them to wait awhile for      payment than to repossess or sue.    </p>    <p>      There is, however, another side to the coin. If a      collection agency has the account, it'll want to squeeze      everything possible from it ... but its representatives      still aren't above haggling. To satisfy them, a smart      debtor would write a woeful missive, describing all the      terrible things that have happened in the few prior months,      which have made it impossible to meet the payment . . .      and, in closing, would offer to pay perhaps 30-50% of the      face value to settle the debt for good.    </p>    <p>      And why should the collectors <em>accept</em> an offer like      that? Because that same bill payer would be sure to mention      in the letter the possibility of retaining an attorney's      services for arranging bankruptcy proceedings . . . which,      if carried out, could flat eliminate the agency's chance      for collecting even one red cent!    </p>    <p>      Anyone going this route naturally has to take precautions      ... such as [1] making sure that the settlement is made in      writing, and signed by both parties before the "wrap-up"      check is sent, [2) using certified mail, return receipt      requested, to post the letter, [3] sending only a money      order or cashier's check (preferably from a post office or      bank not normally used by the payer) with a written      statement on the back indicating whom the payment is for,      whom it's from, and that it constitutes full settlement of      the account in question, and [4] obtaining a photocopy of      both sides of the money order or check.    </p>    <p>      With all these ducks in a row, it's pretty difficult for a      bill payer to get burned . . . but if the agency refuses      such a compromise and insists on pressing for the full      amount of payment, the person in debt can only stand his or      her ground, point out that it's the best offer under the      circumstances, and remind the collector that bankruptcy      proceedings are the only alternative, <em>period.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BILLPAYERS' RIGHTS</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Let's assume, though, that a particular agency is being      especially nasty (or greedy, as it may be). Perhaps its      representatives have pulled out all the stops, and it seems      that their harassment techniques are both varied and      continuous . . . and maybe even illegal. If that's the      case, the best offense is a well-prepared defense.    </p>    <p>      Both the Federal Trade Commission and the states'      collection agency licensing bureaus have guidelines within      which bill-collecting firms must operate. But, since most      consumers aren't aware of this, some collection companies      take advantage of their victims' ignorance and overstep the      bounds of propriety.    </p>    <p>      <em>Then</em> a bill payer's most effective weapons are      presence of mind and a knowledge of the law. In a nutshell,      a collection agency is forbidden to do the following:    </p>    <p>      [1] damage a person's reputation by making his or her debts      public knowledge,    </p>    <p>      [2] threaten an individual with bodily harm,    </p>    <p>      [3] inform an employer - or any third party -      of a person's debts or of the fact that the caller      represents a collection agency, unless specifically      <em>asked,</em>    </p>    <p>      [4] use obscene language,    </p>    <p>      [5] continuously harass a person to upset,    </p>    <p>      [6] falsely suggest that late payment of bills is a serious      and punishable crime,    </p>    <p>      [7) insinuate that they represent a government or law      enforcement agency, either orally or by letterhead,    </p>    <p>      [8] call an individual at work if told, in writing, to      cease,    </p>    <p>      [9] mislead a person into believing that his or her Social      Security, disability, or unemployment checks can be cut off      for nonpayment of debts,    </p>    <p>      [10] provoke immediate payment by threatening to charge an      attorney's or service fee, to which the creditor is not      lawfully entitled,    </p>    <p>      [11] falsely claim to represent a law firm or use legal      stationery.    </p>    <p>      By keeping a level head, a financially strapped person      confronted with such tactics can turn the situation around      to put bill collectors on the spot . . . specifically by      reporting their actions to [ 1 ] the Federal Trade      Commission, [2] the state collection agency licensing      bureau, and [3] the collector's supervisor or employer.    </p>    <p>      Essentially, all this requires is the presentation, in a      letter, of an accurate account or statement of an offending      conversation or exchange of information. Obviously, if      there were oral threats, the complaint would be much more      effective if a voluntary witness had listened in on a      telephone extension when the call was received. Such a      report should make the collection agency realize that it's      dealing with an informed individual, and it may move on to      an easier target.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAVEAT EMPTOR</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Of course, all is not a bed of roses for the person in      debt. If a collection agency brings a court case against a      delinquent bill payer and manages to win a judgment, the      firm can attach up to 25% of his or her wages (after child      support, taxes, and Social Security are deducted) or      whatever's required from a savings or checking account.      (Moreover, if two or more liens are taken against the      debtor's salary, legally he or she can-in some states      - be discharged by an employer.) In addition,      automobiles and other possessions can be taken and      auctioned off to settle a debt (again, with a court order).    </p>    <p>      Filing for Chapter 13 status or for bankruptcy are final      defenses, but before taking those extreme actions, a debtor      should seek the counsel of an attorney. All in all, though,      for the majority of financial difficulties that most folks      might face, just the knowledge of how collection agents      operate should be a sufficient weapon to stave off their      nettling. Should additional assistance be needed, however,      most communities offer a cost-free legal aid or      credit-counseling service that can give even those in the      depths of debt some reassurances, directing them toward the      light at the end of t he tunnel.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For those interested in further      information on dealing with debt problems, How</em> to Turn      the Tables On Bill Collectors - Quickly and Easily      <em>by Dr. Charles H.
