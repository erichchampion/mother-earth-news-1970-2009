        <em>Park's Sweet Banana Whopper was one of the few<br />peppers to perform well despite 1983's cold, wet spring<br />and extremely dry summer . . . . Wayside Gardens'<br />Crimson Cherry Rhubarb is one of the best varieties of<br />this flavorful perennial that the author has ever tested . . . .<br />Gurney Seed's Snow Queen EH is an excellent<br />midseason cultivar and has the added advantage of<br />staying tender longer than most older white corn<br />varieties do .... The tomato is almost everybody's<br />favorite garden crop (in fact, some people grow<br />nothing but 'maters), and Burpee's Supersteak Hybrid<br />VFN combines superb size and flavor with good<br />disease resistance . . . . Field's Double Delight proved<br />to be a productive and drought-resistant bicolor.</em>Â
