                <p>      <em>Here are a mufti-use tarp shelter and two tents: three      rugged, inexpensive items of...</em>    </p>        <h2 id="subtitle">      OUTDOOR GEAR    </h2>        <p>      <em>Readers of outdoor literature who've been around for a      while have undoubtedly encountered one or more of Bradford      Angier's many books. Drawing upon a lifetime of experience      gained living in the wilderness (especially at his      backwoods home on British Columbia's Peace River, near      Hudson Hope), Angier writes with knowledge and a      Thoreauvian</em> <em>simplicity.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Bradford Angier</h5>    <p>      <em>When I'm camping with a pack train, I carry a light      7-1/2' X 12' tarpaulin rolled behind my saddle. Such a      versatile tarp goes with me while I'm canoeing, too.</em>    </p>    <p>      The tarp I've long used I made myself by overlapping and      sewing together three 12' strips of water-repellent green      fabric 32" wide, then adding a 1 " hem all around. The      corners I reinforced by stitching on four 4 "-square pieces      of the same material. Half-inch-diameter grommets at each      corner (rather than the tie-tapes shown in the accompanying      illustration), two on each of the shorter sides, and      <em>three</em> on the two longer sides, completed the job.      And since I used grommets instead of ties, I added a      6'-long, 1/4"-diameter section of rope to each of the metal      eyes.    </p>        <p>      Ordinarily, I pitch this tarp at a single 45Â° slant,      with the two sides bushed in and a cheerful fire burning      companionably in front. It can also be erected several      other ways, depending on the circumstances, as suggested by      the illustrations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Your choice of tarpaulin material will be a matter of      compromise, for the heavier the fabric, the greater both      the abrasion resistance and the tear strength. Yet you'll      likely want the finished product to be as lightweight as is      reasonable.    </p>    <p>      Nylon is a possibility, but its slipperiness makes it an      often-sleazy fabric, prone to fray badly unless finished      seams are used or the edges melted to fuse the yarns      together. Too, the very elasticity of nylon thread, which      makes it excellent for adjustment to stress, causes it to      be difficult to use in home sewing machines. Even though      you can get around this with practice and with proper      tension adjustment, the old dependable cotton still has      vital advantages, not the least of which is its ability to      accept and retain water-repellent treatments.    </p>    <p>      The best tent fabric at the time of this writing is a      cotton reinforced with nylon or Dacron. Even with this      material, though, a water-repellent treatment must be      periodically repeated. The direst enemy of water repellents      is dirt, by the way, so keep your equipment clean.    </p>        <p>      Nylon has ample strength even in ultralight weaves, though      there will be trouble in waterproofing it. A good      combination for lightweight waterproof tentage, then, is a      layer of two-ounce cotton for the covering proper and a top      layer of one-ounce, plasticcoated nylon for a rain fly. The      soundest idea, in any event, is to procure your material      from a reliable tent company (many will mail free      catalogs).    </p>    <p>      Because of the amount of stitching involved, a sewing      machine-which can usually be rented if one is not      already in your home-is almost essential in the      making of tents, sleeping bags, and clothing. The      lockstitch foot is preferable to the chain-stitch foot, as      the seams of the former will not pull out. Rotary bobbins      will sew more rapidly than the long-shuttle varieties. For      those hard-to-reach spots that have to be sewn by hand, a      pair of sturdy needles and a thimble will do the job, along      with a little beeswax to strengthen the thread and, if it's      nylon, keep it from kinking.    </p>    <p>      A sturdy stitch for hand-sewing is shown in the      accompanying illustrations. Such a backstitch assures a      dependable, strong, continuous seam.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TARP CONSTRUCTION</strong>    </p>        <p>      Sew your pieces of material together to make a tarp of the      desired dimensions, hemming the two cut edges or, if the      material is nylon, fusing them with a hot iron. Where the      grommets-or, if you prefer, tie-tapes-are to be      affixed, sew on reinforcements cut from the fabric itself.      Four 4 "-square corner reinforcements will be fine, while      2" X 4" oblongs will suffice along the edges. Conclude the      operation by adding 1/2"-diameter grommets (or tie tapes,      each being a 2' length of twill tape that's folded in the      middle where it's attached to the tarp . . . to give you      two 1' ties at each point).    </p>    <p>      If you wish to dye or decorate the tarpaulin, now's the      time to do it. Then, unless you've used an already      water-repellent material, end the project by waterproofing;      the covering. Begin by pitching the tarptight and      crease-free-some sunny morning. Take a pound of      paraffin (inexpensively procured in cakes at most grocery      stores), cut the block into shavings, and dissolve these in      a gallon of turpentine. The process can be hastened by      placing the can of turpentine and wax in a receptacle of      hot water. <em>Keep it away from flames,</em> however, as      it's quite flammable. Then paint the fabric liberally with      the solution, preferably while both the tarp material and      the solution are warm, and let the tarpaulin stand until      it's thoroughly dry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHELEN LEAN-TO TENT</strong>    </p>        <p>      "Most men are needlessly poor all of their lives because      they think they must have such a house as their neighbors      have," an old woodsman by the name of Henry David Thoreau      observed more than a century ago. "Consider how slight a      shelter is absolutely necessary."    </p>    <p>      The Whelen lean-to tent, designed by the old friend who      wrote <em>On Your Own in the Wilderness</em> with me,      remains my favorite. Colonel Townsend Whelen's pattern,      which is shown here, will accommodate one or two campers,      sleeping with their sides to the front. The previous      discussion of materials and sewing methods, considered in      connection with tarpaulins, holds here as well. Allow one      inch around the edges for hemming. The other key details      follow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONSTRUCTING THE</strong> <strong>WHELEN LEAN-TO      TENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      After cutting the material to the dimensions shown in the      illustration and hemming the edges, sew the back edge of      the awning to the front edge of the tent. Next, insert      grommets at the four "A" points-or attach      tie-tapes-for anchoring the tent to the      ridgepole. At the two "B" points, sew tape loops to the      <em>outside</em> of the tent . . . in periods of heavy      snow, you can tie cords leading from these loops to a tree      or a support pole to keep the roof from sagging in the      middle.    </p>        <p>      Now, at the two "C" points on the front edges of the      awning, attach I "-diameter grommets, into which you'll      insert two sharpened poles to keep the awning extended when      the tent is pitched. Then sew tietapes to the corners of      the awning at the two "D" points-which should align      with the two grommets inserted in the tent's sides at the      "E" points-to secure the awning's side flaps to the tent.      Finally, insert the 10 "F" tape loops through 20 grommets,      spaced as shown along the tent's bottom edges, to accept      the tent pegs.    </p>    <p>      As with the various tarpaulin shelters, you should pitch      the Whelen lean-to tent with its back to the prevailing      wind. Then a brisk fire built out front, with a wall of      rocks or green logs behind as a reflector in the coldest      weather, will provide light and perfect comfort. A mosquito      net can be suspended across the open front of the tent in      bad bug areas, without destroying the openair feeling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE FORESTER TENT</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      If you need to cut weight or cost, the Forester tent is a      good solution. It's one of the best tents ever devised for      a chronic woodsloafer, particularly for one who yearns to      live close to nature and who objects to spending any of his      or her outdoor hours confined in a closed canvas or nylon      cell.    </p>        <p>      The Forester tent is the cheapest of all wilderness tents,      either to make yourself or to buy. It's the easiest and      quickest to construct and pitch, too. And considering its      scant weight and bulk, it's the most comfortable in which      to live and do your few camp chores. Also, with the      exception of the Whelen lean-to tent, it's the easiest to      warm with a campfire out front.    </p>    <p>      The one weak point of the Forester, at least at first      glance, is that if you try to flyproof it, you'll ruin its      inexpensiveness and functional simplicity. In bug time,      however, it's an easy matter to buy a mosquito bar to drape      over the front opening . . . or to make one yourself, or to      hang or stake a net closure over your bed.    </p>    <p>      The Forester tent is triangular in shape when pitched. The      smallest practical dimensions for one person, or for two      who don't mind a bit of crowding, is about 7' wide at the      open front, 3' wide at the back, and 7' deep from front to      rear. The peak should stand about 6' above the ground in      front, while the triangular rear will be some 3' high. With      the entire tent open to the fire in front, the angles are      such that heat and light will be reflected throughout the      sheltered area. It is, of course, a tent for the      wilderness, where poles and firewood are plentiful.    </p>        <p>      This tent is usually pitched with three poles and eight      stakes cut at the campsite. The ridgepole should be long      enough to extend from the peak and to pass down and out      through the opening at the top of the back wall, at such a      tilt that it will rest on the ground about 3' behind the      tent. Two shorter poles are arranged in front as a bipod      brace and, holding the ridgepole at their crossing, run      from the peak to the front corners.    </p>    <p>      The size illustrated here is for one or two campers, with      beds arranged along the side walls. The model I use is made      of closely woven, waterproofed cotton that weighs five      ounces per square yard, cut and sewn to the shape and      dimensions shown, with an extra inch being allowed around      the edges for hemming.    </p>    <p>      Note how the bottoms of the sides are angled back 1' to      make the tent sit right on the ground. To do this, cut your      pattern from rectangular canvas as shown by the dotted      lines, then angle the front and back. The piece for the      rear wall is cut off square at the top, so that when it's      stitched to the main body of the tent at the rear, a hole      is left at the top of the back wall through which the      ridgepole can extend. Total weight for this size Forester      tent is about four pounds.    </p>        <p>      <strong>TO THE ROAD LESS TAKEN</strong>    </p>    <p>      I hope that you outdoorspeople will find each of these      time-tested projects - the versatile tarp shelter,      the Whelen lean-to tent, and the Forester tent - as      economical, fun to make, and satisfying to use as I have      all these many years.    </p>
